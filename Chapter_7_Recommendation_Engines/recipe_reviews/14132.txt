This is a fantastic recipe!  Now  know why there are so many glowing reviews.  It's so easy (I was done, from start to finish in 15 minutes.  We're vegetarian and it's difficult to find a black bean soup in restaurants that's not made with chicken stock or doesn't have bacon.  Now I can make the black bean soup that my husband loves so much right at home.  Upon other reviewers suggestions, I saved one cup of beans to add whole, I added 3 teaspoons lime juice, triple the cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic, freshly chopped cilantro and 1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper.  I also used the immersion blender and blended the soup right in the pot (talk about a great invention!).  The soup came out perfect and tasted great with quesadillas.  Next time, I'll probably saute some onions and add some corn for a different taste in the soup.  Thanks very much for this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!!

We have looked into the sodium, and it appears the excess was coming from the vegetable broth. We linked that ingredient to a more generic vegetable broth, and it seems to have reduced the sodium. To address the beans issue, the sodium will go down by an additional 500 mg if using no-salt-added black beans. Rinsing and draining should also help.

Add Sherry! I've used hundreds of Allrecipes and this is the first time I felt compelled to add a review. This is fantastic soup! I used the suggestions of sauteed onions and garlic in pan first, used three cans of beans (two pureed, one left whole), extra cumin, splash of hot sauce, and added chopped cilantro. I also added a splash of Sherry, as I know this is the secret ingredient in my favorite restaurant soup. Delectable! I planned to freeze the leftover but we ate it all.

Very tasty soup!  I agree with other reviewers to reserve some of the black beans whole.  I used 1 can low fat low sodium chicken broth and 1 can Rotel instead of the salsa.  I also sauteed some sweet Vidalia onion and garlic before adding beans, broth, and Rotel.  I added cumin, dash red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder.  Then I used a hand held blender (Emeril calls it the boat motor) and blended until I got the consistency I wanted.  Then added the reserved whole black beans.  I left lid off pot and let it simmer to reduce the amount of liquid and concentrate the flavors.  At the very end I added the juice of a lime.  It was delicious.  Great base recipe to add your favorite flavors! When serving I added a dollop of no fat sour cream and some chopped green onions. A meal in itself! Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was wonderful!  I did make a few changes:  I used chicken broth vs. vegetable broth.  I used homemade salsa that was heavy with garlic and cilantro.  I didn't have enough black beans, so I added about  1/4 cup refried beans.  I followed the advise of some other reviews and left some black beans whole.  I also added cayenne and sauteed chopped onion to the bean mixture.  To make it a heartier meal, I added 1-1/2 cup rice and 1/2 cp corn to the soup.
I can't wait to make this again!

I've made Black Bean soup from scratch which takes so much longer than this recipe and yet the taste is the same, so why make it from scratch again?  Thanks for the recipe.  I added cubed grilled chicken to the soup which was good too.  Remember to leave a can or so of the beans out of the blender so you have some whole or mashed type beans in the soup for texture. I also added alittle sherry to the recipe.  It's how I've always made black bean soup.  Try it, it's great:)

This the easiest soup I have ever made and my boyfriend loved it! We have also omited part of the broth to make it into a black bean dip. Excellent with tortilla chips :)

This was AMAZING!!  I loved it.

I modified the recipe by making it for 6.. 1 1/2 cups salsa, 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 3 cans beans, and 2 cups vegetable broth.  

I blended everything but 1 can of the beans.  I drained and rinsed those and added them to the pot, then added the blended mixture to that. 

This gave the soup more 'substance', I really liked it with some beans in it.  Great, great soup!!

Adding to all of the other great comments, I thought this was very delicious and very easy to make. In spite of the simple ingredients, it was very flavorful. I added some leftover cooked rice (about 1/2 cup) to this and it added a nice texture to it. It also freezes very well without effecting the taste or texture. I have already added this to my "must-make" soups list.

Quite good, I was very surprized. I used organic beans, organic broth and a quality chunky salsa. Next time, I might saute some onion, garlic and red pepper and add that. For a quick soup, this was very good. I had a cup of this with half of a sandwich for lunch and I was quite satisfied.

This was a fantastic soup-spicy, quick and tasty-it took more time to bake the cornbread I made to accompany the soup than the actual soup did!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I am always looking for new twists on my old standbys. I have made gallons of black bean soup, most from a recipe that I got almost 40 years ago in Key West. This recipe, along with many of the suggestions I found in other reviews, gave me the ideas for my final recipe. Thank you everyone, especially Maryanne. Here is what I did, I diced a large onion and minced 5 cloves of garlic and cooked them a bit in some olive oil, I drained and rinsed 4 cans of black beans, added to the onions, added 1 box low sodium chicken broth, 1 tablespoon cumin, 2 teaspoons of Mrs Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning, 1 jar medium salsa. I blended all until smooth with imersion blender...then added in my final can of rinsed and drained beans. This is by far the most tasty and easy pot of soup I have ever made. I will serve it tomorrow with cheese quesadillas, I can't wait!

I was skeptical that such a simple soup could really be as good as the reviews indicate. WOW. That's all I can say. This soup is awesome!! Next time, I'll probably only blend half the black beans; I typically like my soup a little chunkier.

I love this soup. If you do it as-is it's good. If you spice it up it's GREAT. I like using dried beans that I soak and cook with a hint of cilantro,(that way I know exactly what's in them!) low-sodium organic broth, and organic medium-hot salsa. But when I spice it up, I add corn kernels, garlic, cilantro, tomato chunks (after blending) and serve with corn chips and cheese quesadillas cut into dip-able slices. It's also good with cubed chicken in it.

This recipe is nearly identical to one from Real Simple magazine years back.  It's been a go to for me and always gets rave reviews.  

If you have a hand blender, life is oh so much easier.  And some chopped avocado on top is a nice addition.

I liked the base recipe, but it definitely needed some "oomph".  Though I rarely mess with a recipe the first time I make it, this time I did.  I added an extra tsp of cumin, a tsp of cilantro, and 5 drops of Frank's Red Hot sauce--that did the trick!  Put shredded taco cheese on top of the sour cream as well.  Will be making again.

This was a pretty good recipe, however I felt for me, I needed a bit more seasoning. I added two cloves of garlic (which I sauteed in the stock, then added the rest of the ingredients), chili powder, ground coriander, more cumin, a dash of hot sauce and some lime juice (just a tad). I also served with cilantro and avocado (no sour cream - it really doesn't need it). The end result was really good and I'll definitely be making it again. 

This recipe is a great recipe jumping off point, that you can doctor up to your liking.

I LOVE this recipe!  It's cheap, healthy, fast, simple, made from on-hand ingredients -- perfect!  On top of that, my boyfriend (who swears to hate ALL beans) not only ate this soup, but now requests it regularly!  Because it's so simple, the quality of the salsa matters.  Just like when cooking with wine, be sure to use a salsa that you like to eat (as it will surely influence the overall outcome).  One thing to note:  the sour cream and green onions are much more than a garnish and should not be left out.  They add immensely to the soup, giving it just the right creaminess and crunch.

Does not have the depth of flavor that you get from cooking your own beans all day with the herbs and seasonings...BUT for a quick, satisfying meal at the last minute or after work, this cannot be beat.  I use home made chicken stock (always have in the freezer) and drained/rinsed the beans as All Recipes recommends to cut the sodium.

I agree with everyone who said that this recipe is great to experiment with.  I usually like to follow the recipe fairly exactly, but I ran into a little trouble with the food processor, so I decided to skip that step and instead just cook it un-processed.  Somewhere along the way, my mom suggested that I throw in some frozen corn, so I did and simmered it for about 8-10 minutes.  The result was an excellent southwestern soup that I garnished with a little shredded cheddar cheese and served with warmed flour tortillas.  I'd recommend it to anyone.

One of the easiest and flavorful soups I've tasted!! This one is definitely a keeper!  I did make a few modifications...  I added 1/4 onion, 1/4 jalapeno, garlic powder, and a handful of cilantro to  the food processor. Along with other reviewers I also reserved one can of the black beans to add more texture to the soup.  Used medium heat salsa and it was just perfect with just the right amount of spice. Will make again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

If you are looking for a Black Bean Soup recipe, this isn't it.  The taste of the salsa really overpowers the beans and it tasted more like salsa soup.  I was disappointed and threw the soup away as it was inedible.  Someone in the house thought it could be salvaged as a dip, but I have better recipes for that.  Still looking for a good vegetarian Black Bean soup.

Terrific soup anytime of year! I made this yesterday and took the advice of some of the other reviewers, only blending one can of black beans with the broth in order to have some "chunkiness" to the soup.  In addition, I only added 1/2 cup of salsa and then added a full can of diced petite tomatoes and some extra seasonings. It was delish.  I topped each serving with sour cream, mexican cheese blend, and some toasted corn tortilla strips.  Served with a small salad, this makes a great (not to mention healthy and easy) meal.

I have now been making this soup for six years and still love it. I have played with it a little, but it great just as written. The changes I usually make are to increase the beans to 3 cans. I blend about 1 1/2 cans and leave the other 1 1/2 cans whole. If I have time I will saute some garlic and onion, but most of the time I am making this soup I am in a hurry for a quick and healthy meal, so I don't bother. There have been a few reviewers who comment on the high sodium of this recipe. I buy organic black beans and they are very low in sodium. You can use dried beans to cut it back even further. I use low sodium broth from Trader Joes. You can also look for low sodium salsa.  I love this recipe. It is quick to put together, tasty and more importantly healthy if you cut down on the sodium.

Very easy. I garnished with cheddar cheese and it was delicious. I also used beef broth instead of vegetable and it came out great. I think this will become a regular in our house.

Excellent soup. I added diced bell peppers, corn and onions to make it a little chunky and added an extra can of beans not mashed. Everyone loved it!

I have made this many times as written. I always leave half the beans and all the salsa whole for texture, though it does take a bit longer to cook and blend flavors. This is a very adaptable recipe. I have begun experimenting with different beans, and today I added one can of CHILI BEANS (undrained) and one can of corn which was delicious. The bean mixture, before adding the broth is a fine bean dip on its own. Don't forget the chips!

We loved this soup! It was SO good.  I blended one can of the beans with the broth in the blender, and then added the salsa plus a small can of diced spicy tomatoes- didn't puree this, just chopped it a bit... I wanted to keep some chunks.  Then I added the mixture to the saucepan with the other (whole) beans.  I added the cumin and the juice of half a small lime.  Didn't use the sour cream (didn't have any) or the onions.  We came up with a bunch of variations we want to try, including corn, chicken, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, cilantro, bell peppers, and different salsas- we used Archer Farms Three Bean, which was good, but different salsa would add variety.  We can't wait to make it again.  We ate it with some cheese quesadillas and tortilla chips.

Really quick and really good.  Not substantial enough to make a meal by itself, but it goes very well with quesadillas.  It might not look too appealing, but a dab of sour cream really helps it out.  We also like to increase the number of black beans we put directly into the soup.

INCREDIBLE! Simple, healthy, and SO delicious. A fantastic lunch with a side of tortillas or cheese quesadillas. Even my kiddos who don't like black beans themselves love using this as a dip!

SODIUM INTAKE: 
I don't know why the ESHA database gave this so much sodium.  None of the ingredients (with the possible exception of sour cream) contain noticable sodium in and of themselves.  I think that most canned black beans have sodium added, and that since the recipe calls for canned black beans, that the database gave the average amount of sodium on that basis.  However, there is no reason why one can't use dried beans, or simply cans with no added sodium.

I didn't have a few ingredients so I had to substitute a few things: cumin was substituted for chili powder, green onion was substituted for red onion (added during blending). I also added two teaspoons of sriracha hot sauce and garnished with crushed tortilla chips.

Yum! I made a few changes though because I think the original recipe would have been too bland. I sauteed half an onion and 2 cloves of garlic, then added that to to the food processor. Also, I reduced the broth to 1 cup because more would be too watery. With the changes, this was pretty tasty and healthy (well, minus the large dollop of sour cream on top--which by the way, makes this EVEN better!).

This tasted good, but it needs a little more texture to it, in my opinion.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and put some of the whole black beans into the blended mixture and then heat it up.  I topped it with a little shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and it was very good.

Sorry, I can't give a review based on experience due to my review of the nutritional information which eliminates this recipe from potential use.  Do any of you realize that a serving of this soup provides over 2000 mg of sodium?  Dangerous stuff for those of us who are watching our sodium intake or anyone else who plans to eat any food containing salt for the next 24 hours.

This is one of my favorite go-to meals. My husband, not a vegetarian, loves it too. I follow the recipe exactly, just vary the brand of salsa to change it up from time to time. Super easy and super delicious! Served with tortilla chips and some chopped avocado over the sour cream puts it over the top.

Pathetically easy. Really. If you like your soup smooth, follow the recipe. If you want some whole beans floating around (like a lot of folks do), add a can or two of rinsed black beans. Easy peasy.

Tasty and easy recipe.  Throw it in a blender and then heat it up.  Recipes don't get much easier.  Thank you.  I did not have two cans of black beans, so I used one can of black beans and one can of red kidney beans.  I like garlic a lot and add it to practically all soup recipes, so I added 1 tbsp minced garlic.  I also added 1 tbsp of cinnamon.

I loved how easy this was to make!! A couple of strong suggestions:
1. Add a chipotle in adobe sauce to give it a nice smoky flavor
2. Quadruple the beans! I smushed up 2 cans of beans with my blender and then added another 30 ounce can of black beans to give it texture.
3. Add ANY leftover meat you have, ie. chicken, steak, hamburger meat, to give it that extra richness.
4. Add garlic, lots of extra cumin and lime juice.
5. Garnish with plenty of cilantro, sour cream, green onions and crunched up tortilla chips
6. Double the recipe or you will be just doing it again the next day!

Delicious! Made as written, only reserving one can of beans and pureeing the rest of the ingredients in the pot with my immersion blender. This could not be a more simple recipe. I used salsa from a jar that my husband bought for (gag!) $9 at a local produce stand. Nasty stuff with chips, but I knew I could use it  in a recipe.  It worked perfectly in this one. I cranked the heat to medium-high and it was all ready in 10 minutes, start to finish. Served with cheese quesadillas for a complete meal.  I'm on the fence about adding sautéed onions/garlic next time. I'm not sure they're necessary, given the extra work. I'm also considering amping up the nutrition with the addition of diced red peppers and jalapeños. Delicious as is, and easy to play with, too. Try it!

This was great. I used chicken broth because it's what I had on hand, and added a little garlic and some onion powder. Next time I'm going to use a salsa that's less spicy.

This makes a great easy soup.  I added rice and omitted the green onions.

I loved this recipe. I replaced the veggie broth with chicken broth and added tortilla strips to add a bit more substance.

So easy to throw together with items already in the pantry!  I didn't have any salsa the day I made the soup so I used a can of Ro-Tel and chicken stock in place of the vegetable stock.  We had some leftover cooked brown rice and added that as well to make a really delicious & hearty soup for a cold day.

I really liked this soup but I would make some changes... I think its too thin as it is.. either use less broth or add more beans. Also, I added cilantro and sweet peppers.

I really enjoyed this but I also added the juice from one lime and garlic salt. This really could have used some crunch so the next time I will likely add some corn and possibly an extra can of whole black beans. This is 7 Weight Watcher Smart Points but if you omit the sour cream it's only 4 points.

This was an amazingly easy recipe that only took 5 minutes to prepare, with minimal ingredients, and it came out absolutely delicious. Even my husband enjoyed this and that says a lot! I did two things differently from the recipe which included adjusting the salt usage. How much salt you add is up to your personal preference. 
One really important thing I did differently from this recipe was to only process ¾ of the beans adding the rest in with the mixture in the sauce pan. Along with the green onions, this will give your soup texture. The sour cream will provide additional creaminess at the end. If you are looking for a quick, easy, and cheap soup recipe that is really tasty, this is it.

This made a good base, but I had my son (who is a HS culinary student) play with it and add some spices (salt, pepper, paprika, crushed red pepper, chili powder & onion powder) to make it more flavorful.  He suggested adding 1/2 an onion the next time.  I will definitely make it again with his suggestions.

Extremely easy to make, plus it's delicious.  Used an immersion blender right in the sauce pan.  Followed other suggestions and kept out 1/2 c beans.  Also, added some dry cilantro and 1/2 tsp. lime juice.  Will need to make again soon!

This was good, but I added more ingredients to make it a heartier soup.  I first sauteed red bell peppers with chopped garlic.  I then added the recipe ingredients to the pan.  Once they were heated through, I scooped half of the soup into a blender and blended until smooth.  I poured the blended soup back into the pot and added frozen corn, chopped fresh cilantro, and the juice from one lime.  It turned out deliciously chunky and flavorful.

this was really delicious!  I used beef broth and mixed in some chopped green onion while cooking.  We then mixed in the sour cream in our bowls and it was absolutely superb!  Great to serve with the quesadillas!

Made this Sunday and it was a hit with the family...I used chicken broth in place of the veggie broth and seasoned it to taste with Tony Chachere seasoning.  It was even better the second day!

Great idea! Added the whole container of store made salsa and added chili powder. Will make again! This time with lime and/or chicken. Def purée one can of beans and leave one whole. Easy, healthy, and delicious! Even better after 2 days!

So easy, tasty, and healthy!  I used 3 cans of beans, rinsed and drained.  Reserved 1 can.  Added 1 tsp no sodium chx bouillon and 2 cups water.  Added some chili powder, garlic powder, and lime juice.  Used the immersion blender, then added the last can of beans and some frozen corn.  In just a few min over med-high heat, dinner was ready!

This recipe is amazing as is. My whole family loves it, including my 2 year old. I use this soup as a base, and to make it really filling, after scooping it into each bowl, I add 1/2 - 1 whole avocado per bowl, some chopped cilantro, tortilla chips and sour cream. It makes this soup beyond delicious and really knocks it out of the park. My husband likes to add cheese to his as well. 

I've considered blending avocado and cilantro right into the soup, but haven't tried it yet. I like the chunks the cut up avocado adds to the dish when added after the soup is blended.

For the short amount of time it takes to make this soup, it is awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!  As per other suggestions, I started off with about 1/2 cup diced onion, a bit of butter and chicken stock, and a tsp of garlic puree.  I followed the recipe as is except for using chicken broth because that is what I had.  I also reserved about a cup of whole beans and added them back to the soup after pureeing.  I also added 1/2 can of corn packed in water.  Because I used a mild salsa, I added a few dashes of Frank's hot sauce and about 1/8 of tsp of chipotle puree for heat and flavour.

Topped with green onions, low fat sour cream, and a few crushed tortilla chips, I impressed my friend with a homemade lunch and my husband happily polished the rest off for dinner.

If you're looking to cut back the sodium, President's Choice Blue Menu has sodium-reduced black beans and also canned corn packed in water (no salt at all).

Very simple to make and turned out better than I expected:  as others had suggested, I used used a can of rotel as the salsa.  Served with yellow rice so it could be put on a plate (instead of a bowl).

This recipe was amazing!  I sauteed a medium onion with a shallot and garlic, then added about a cup of corn and a cup of the beans to the pan and let the flavors meddle together.  I blended everything else and threw in the beans, corns and onions and simmered it for a bit, then served as per the recipe except that I added a sprinkle of cheddar-jack cheese on top of the soup.  I served it with a cheese quesadilla and even I couldn't believe how delicious it was! I will definitely be making this again!

This was very quick and easy.  I followed the directions exactly.  I liked the flavor of it, but I think we would prefer it thicker (without the broth) either on top of rice or as a dip for chips, so that's how I'll try it next time.

I used rotel plus salsa, 3 teaspoons lime juice, double the cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a full jalapeno.  I also only blended half the beans.  It tastes so good!  I was surprised by how good it was.  This will be a regular in my kitchen.

I think this is a good soup - so I gave it 4 stars, as written. However, with some additions, it would be a 5. Definitely add garlic, extra cumin and lime - also, I used low sodium chicken broth, for better flavor.

I made this last night; I needed something quick because my husband's plans changed and he ended up coming home for dinner, and this fit the bill.  We both loved it!  I told him I thought about putting in more garlic, but he said "Don't change a thing!"  I made it even easier by putting the first four ingredients right in the pot and using the immersion blender to blend it all together, then I heated it up.  The only problem is that it only made three servings (about 1 c. each), not 4.  I will definitely be making this again.

I just love this quick and yummy soup! It goes together in a snap. I puree it after heating, using my immersion blender, and it works perfectly. Great topped with shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, a little diced green onion, or even a dollop of guacamole. Add a salad and some warm corn tortillas on the side and you're all set!

My version was ***** but I made a few changes inspired by the comments of others.  I started by sauteeing 1 garlic and 1/2 chopped onion in olive oil, then I added rinsed beans (reserved about a cup for later), the salsa (Herdez brand), cumin, and chicken stock (didn't have veggie).  Once hot, used the immersion blender and then added back remaining beans. Final touches were chopped green onion and cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime.  Amazing, and very fast.  Good with sour cream but a little cheddar on top was also a nice addition.  It is a bonus that most of the ingredients are easy to keep on hand in the pantry.

One of our family favorites! We love this! It is so simple and yet has the spice that we all love.  I often use dried beans and prepared  chicken bullion to make it less expensive.  Good recipe! Thank you!

This soup is outstanding! So easy, SO good! I added more than one cup of salsa in the food processor, then used less chicken stock. I added more spices: garlic, cumin, onion powder, crushed red pepper, a dash of hot sauce. I saved one can of black beans to add texture to the soup. Served with a dollop of sour cream. Really, really great recipe!!!

Fabulous! It is a keeper and will be appearing on my table on a monthly basis.  As other reviewers suggested, I saved one cup of beans to add whole, I added 3 teaspoons lime juice, doubled the cumin, doubled the garlic and jalapeno pepper.  Added a diced onion.  Thanks very much for this recipe.

I made this soup as directed the first time and really enjoyed it.  I made some modifications the second time to reduce the sodium and enjoyed it even more:  I diced a medium onion and sauteed it for a few minutes.  I then added some minced garlic and sauteed it with the onions for another few minutes.  I blended one can of drained, rinsed beans with the cumin, chunky salsa, and 15oz of water (filled up the black bean can with water) instead of vege broth.  I then put the blended mixture in the pot with the onions/garlic and the other can of drained/rinsed beans.  I brought it to a boil and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  I then added some crushed red pepper for some heat, the juice of a half lime and some fresh cilantro.  Very delicious.

Who would've thought to just blend beans and salsa? Yummy! I used three cans of beans (we love them) and left one whole. Also used the immersion blender and I added cilantro. Someone said this soup tasted like the inside of a burrito so I actually made this again leaving out the broth and I made QUICK and fast burritos (adding cheese and onions the microwaving for about 30 seconds!) Delicious!

Excellent!  This recipe is so simple and tastes wonderful.  I used Pace lime and cilantro chunky salsa and chicken broth instead of vegetable.  The lime flavor really added to the soup.  I also added pre-cooked strips of steak to make it a heartier meal.  No longer vegetarian but delicious!

Very delicious soup!  I looked at previous reviews and saw complaints about it being too watery, so I drained the salsa before I put it in the food processor to get rid of extra moisture.  Turned out great.  My husband said the soup tasted like the inside of a burrito.  I will make this again soon.

This was a delicious soup!  I made a homemade salsa (very easy... just tomatoes, chilis, onion and cilantro) instead of jarred salsa.  It lent a really "fresh" taste to the soup.  I did find that it seemed a bit watery... I think next time, I'll reserve some of the beans and leave them whole in the soup.  Over all, very good and very easy to make!

This is probably the fastest recipe I have ever made with such outstanding results!  I put it together for a party I was having and everyone raved!  They couldn't believe how fast I made it.  The only change I made was reserving about 1 cup of the black beans to add to the blended mixture...that way the soup had some texture to it.  (Or maybe I just blended it too long)  You have to try this easy recipe!

This recipie is so fast and delicious I couldn't believe it. The best thing is you can make it as spicy as you like depending on you salsa. I have also made it without the broth and used it as a bean dip or in burritos.

This sort of recipe is ingenious in its simplicity and is just the thing to save a dinner party.  I do wish the flavors were slightly more complex, although they are still very satisfying.  I chilled mine in the refrigerator for an hour and touted it as Black Bean Gazpacho.  Well worth the effort in midsummer!

This was incredibly simple and so DELICIOUS! 

(Sour Cream on top is MUST as it provides a great, cool contrast to the soup.) This will be a staple in my house from now on.

Good as it stands, but I would give this a 3.5 if I could fine-tune the rating to that degree.  Didn't have that amazing Cuban flavor...perhaps missing garlic, lime & more cumin???  Next time will only blend one can of rinsed beans and keep the other whole, will add 2 tsp garlic, double the cumin & add a little lime juice.  I used a medium heat salsa & daughter thought it was too spicy; however, everyone else thought the spice was acceptable (although we all squeezed lime over the beans and rice).  Use your best judgement, and definitely add garlic, more cumin and some lime juice if you are looking for a more authetic Cuban flavor.  I served these with brown rice, a low-fat version of slow cooker Lechon Asado and tossed salad.  Very enjoyable meal with few leftovers...try this with minor modifications & some additional Cuban food & you will have a home run for a meal!!!

First time I've rated/reviewed!  Fastest & yummiest soup you can imagine.  I only had refried black beans; guess what--make it even easier--no blender/immersion needed.  And to the misanthrope reviewers out there--especially the dummy who blamed the salsa--what made you even THINK the onions could taste cooked??  Then said it tasted good, but rated it one star.  I don't get it.  Chicken stock, generous w/cumin, onion powder, and garlic pepper.  You just won't believe how yummy this is!!!!

My kids loved this recipe and begged me to make it the next day after we ate it. I didn't add the cumin, but added a small can of chilies after I doubled the original recipe. I also served it with tortilla chips. Delicious!

I  make this soup often & just love how simple it is to make, yet so delicious! Like most reviewers, I also leave some beans whole. Depending on what salsa I have on hand, I also up the spices. Occasionally, I'll add a can of corn as well. However, even just following the recipe as written, it's a 5 star recipe!

Fantastic. In addition to the recipe ingredients, I doubled the cumin, a little cinnamon, and sour cream to two cans of black beans in the blender. Heated, added shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

The recipe trifecta: healthy, tasty, and quick n' easy!  Great find.  If you have a couple cans in your pantry and some broth mix, you're all set!

This recipe works and it is good as is. Super great for a quick week night meal because it is just pantry items. Loved it. No recipe rewrites here.

Rave reviews from my family, which are generally not soup lovers. Changes I made: I sauteed 1/2C onion first, added a can of corn, and used my immersion blender to smooth it out a bit. I didn't add sour cream or cheese as we were eating it will grilled cheese. It came together quickly with items I had on hand. Would be great for a Costco meal plan.

I loved this soup! The dollop of sour cream really compliments the flavor, and it's so easy to make. That's my kind of recipe! I added a can of corn, some garlic and hot sauce. Very tasty!

I made this for the family during the cold snap.  Quick and easy.  Adults & kids enjoyed it.  I used salsa verde and a couple of us sprinkled shredded cheese on top. I also added a little leftover  red pepper tomato soup  since I only had the salsa verde and wanted to have a little of the tomato that would be in normal salsa.  Will make again.

Great soup and very versatile! My favorite kind of recipe! LOL! I love the fact that it can be vegan for our vegan friends.  A great recipe to have in the recipe box! I chose to saute onions and garlic for more flavor; used chicken broth cause that is what I had on hand; used homemade salsa sauce (doubled); also added another can of beans (whole) as DH prefers chunks in his soup; used some homemade taco seasoning and dried chiles to taste.  Have used toppings such as sour cream, cilantro, nacho cheese, and tortilla chips! Served with corn bread. Yum! Thanks Maryanne for a an easy, quick, and versatile recipe!

It's a 10 minute dinner that is healthy and delicious!  What's not to like?  I pureed 1 can of beans, and left the other can whole.  I also used chicken stock for a bit more flavor, but I'm sure it would be good with veggie stock too.

Very good, extremely fast and easy. I only made 1/2 recipe to use up a container of store-bought-homemade, refrigerated type salsa which no one liked because it was so watery. So I drained the salsa and came up with a 1/2 cup salsa. I added 6 oz chicken stock (had leftover) and 1 can of black beans. I did add 1.5 teaspoons of cumin (even though I halfed the recipe). I heated and refrigerated the leftovers. I thought it tasted better the 2nd day. I will defintely make again and the ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE - 3 cans of black beans and not blend the 3rd can some whole black beans. And yes, tortilla chips, sour cream and onions are a must!

Really good an easy!  The first time I made it I didn't have black beans, so I did it with Cannellini beans and TraderJoe's Green Chile Verdi Salsa.  Dee-lish!  2nd time I made it is did as directed, and was still delish!  I didn't have sour cream on hand, but it was still yummy without it.  A great recipe to use up some pantry staples.

I cannot believe how good this soup was!  It was ready in less than 10 minutes and tasted as good as most restaurant soups.  Next time I will keep some of the beans on one side before before blending and perhaps jazz it up with some lime and cilantro.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  Nice and thick.  Good texture.  I followed the advice of others by cooking 1 small diced onion and 2 cloves garlic, then added all other ingredients - reserving 1/2 can beans. Used 1 T cumin, added a dash of chili powder and 1/2 a jalapeno since I used mild salsa.  

Hand blended to almost smooth consistency, then added 1/2 can beans, 1/4 cup corn and heated through.  Topped with chopped avocado, sour cream, diced cheese, and fresh cilantro.  

I have made black bean soup using 2 other recipes, and not only was this fast and easy, it also tasted the best and had the best texture.

Soooo GOOD. I doubled the recipe, used dry black beans, homemade chicken stock and added a couple tablespoons of sherry and lime juice and served it with avocado sour cream.  I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the great recipe Maryanne!

This is wonderful!  I would have rated it 5 stars but I made many modifications based on other reviews.  Do saute and add some minced garlic and onion, it really enhances the flavor.  I used 3 cans of beans and kept 1 can whole to add at the end.  I added about 2 tsp of fresh lime juice toward the end of cooking.  I used a medium salsa to give it a bit of a kick and also added a dash of hot pepper sauce.  What a wonderful, healthy and hearty soup!  I make extra portions of this and take in for lunch.

Simplicity and taste are what make this five stars for me. My husband and I love the black bean soup at a local restaurant, and this tastes very similar. Great for a night when we don't want to spend the money on a fancy dinner and a tip.

I saved this recipe over a year ago but just recently made. I followed the receipe exactly and thought it was just okay- 4 stars. I made it again a week later - with tweaks - and am so happy with it that I bought 8 cans of black beans this morning! The major change is pureeing two cans of beans and then adding a can of whole beans. Same measurements for everything else, but I use veggie broth instead. It's thicker, heartier, and doesn't separate. I don't even heat it- just pour it directly into containers and microwave at work at lunchtime.

Quick and tastes great.  I added some sauteed onion and garlic and a bit more cumin and a couple hits of Frank's hot sauce and fresh cilantro and it was amazing.  I liked it better with cheddar cheese on top instead of sour cream.  Nice base recipe, lots of options to fit your tastes!

WOW...the reviews were so good on this one I had to try it!  DELICIOUS!!!  Quite possibly the best soup I've ever tasted!

I took the advice of other reviews and changed a couple of things:

1.  Keep one cup of beans whole
2.  Add one can of Rotel instead of salsa
3.  Add one cup of sauteed onions
4.  Triple the amount of cumin
5.  Add one teaspoon of garlic powder
6.  Top soup with fresh sliced jalapeno & cilantro
7.  Serve with corn muffins.

This one is a keeper!!!  :)

I just made this- it was delicious, simple, and quick, and easy to cut down to just two servings foe my boyfriend and me. The green onions added just the right flavor too. It was savory, filling, and smooth to eat. Five stars for sure. I made no changes to the recipe.

We thought this was tasty, but not a stand alone meal - we ate it with a nice salad and bread.  I found the low-sodium beans and broth as allrecipes suggested, and I rinsed the beans well.  I also used a nice chunky salsa.

Only one word comes to mind:  FANTASTIC!  I used others suggestions to add 3 t lime juice, triple the cumin and add a 3rd can of black beans (left whole).  This soup is better than Panera's version!

I thought this was great and ridiculously easy!  I agree with those who said to keep one can of beans whole--I would have liked it a bit heartier.  Next time I may make a few additions--possibly tomatoes, cilantro, cheese--but that would just be for a change--it is delicious as-is.

Very easy and fast, a good "weeknight" soup.  I rinsed my beans and used chicken broth, I did not think it was too salty.  Very easy to adjust the spice by using different salsas.  I will make this often!

I can't believe I haven't already reviewed this recipe! I've made it so many times, and I love it more every time! I use chicken broth in mine with a Medium Heat salsa. Sometimes I cook garlic and onion first to beef it up. We love ours topped with shredded cheddar and crushed tortilla chips. Fresh chopped tomatoes on top are great too. Delicious any way you like to top it. This freezes beautifully too!

I've made this exact recipe many times before except I save some whole beans to add later. (given a choice, I prefer the flavor of chicken broth to the vegetable broth)  Quick & easy.

This was SO quick and tasty!  Tastes just like the black bean soup at a local Mexican restaurant!  I did use HOT salsa by accident and had to re-make the whole thing because my mouth was on FIRE!  Be sure you pay attention to the type of salsa you use - it DOES make a difference!

This recipe was outstanding, especially since it can be made so quickly. I made it with three cans of beans though - 2 blended and 1 can left whole to give it some substance. I also placed a healthy serving of brown rice at the bottom of each bowl before adding the soup. This gave it even more substance and made it rather filling. While cooking I added a splash or two of garlic powder and onion powder. This dish tastes a lot better than I thought it would! And it's so easy to make!

Awesome soup.  I did alter it based on multiple reviewers common suggestions: Didn't blend first; used 3 cans of drained beans, reserving one can for the end; sauteed in oil 1/2 onion and 1 jalapeno, both diced, until tender; added a couple pressed garlic cloves to the onion and cooked until fragrant; used 1 can of Ro-Tel; used 2 cups chicken broth; increased cumin to 1 tablespoon; when soup was done simmering I used an immersion blender to a consistency I liked, then added the reserved whole beans plus the kernels from a raw ear of corn. Garnished with sour cream and cilantro.

This soup is awesome, we eat it all the time!  I reserve one can of beans and 1/2 of the salsa from the blender and just put them straight into the saucepan.  It gives the soup some chunks so that it's not a puree.  So easy and so good!

This is amazing for the amount of time and small number of ingredients put into it!  I used beans I had pressure cooked instead of canned--helps cut out the sodium--and this soup is the best black bean soup I've ever had!

I had a 25 oz can of black beans to work with, so I used 1C salsa, 1C chicken broth, squirt of lime juice, and a half tsp each of cumin and chili powder.  I pureed it with an immersion blender, then added 1C of corn.  Easy and delicious!

We blend only about half the beans and leave the others whole. Our 2-year-old and 8-month-old love to pick out the whole beans and eat them before they finish off the soup. My husband loves this especially. He always uses the leftovers to dip chips in for a midnight snack.

***Wow*** Where has this recipe been all my life? As others raved - so easy, yet so delicious. The extra spice suggestions were good.  I rarely have green onion on hand, so I'll often throw in a small white or yellow onion diced. My family likes some added texture to this soup and I hold a cup or so back of the mixture from the blender.  I've also thrown in some pre-cooked brown or white rice - a great way to use up some leftovers and add additional texture.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe!! I followed the recipe as closely as I could based on what I had on hand. I followed one of the other reviewers suggestion of blending only one can of soup and then adding the other and it gave a very nice texture to the soup. I also added al fresco sweet red pepper chicken sausage cut up and a bit of shredded four cheese Mexican blend cheese. The sausage added a little kick to the soup and the cheese made it a little creamier. Absolutely wonderful and amazingly quick. Mixed with a fresh garden salad and you have a complete meal.

Im only giving it a 3 star for its overall taste. It was good black bean soup. 500 people givin it 41/2 stars and i expected the best soup in the universe. It is however excellent for how easy it was to prepare. It took less than 5 minutes. And its relatively cheap. I used a large can of goya beans (30oz) {certain goyas dont have preservatives}, trader joe veggie broth, and whole foods roasted chipotle salsa. The salsa is what gives the soup most of its flavor, so try something bold. I also added some fresh cilantro to the blender. I think Ill add some fresh veg to the pot next time i make it. (Onions, garlic, corn, peppers, carrots, potato)

I've made three different versions of this recipe and this is my favorite: add 1/2 cup fresh cilantro to blended mixture, add 3 tsp lime juice, add 2 jalapeno peppers (seeds and all pureed), triple the cumin, add 3 tsp minced garlic, reserve half the black beans to add after blending.

I've tried the recipe with canned whole kernel corn, which was okay, but I think I prefer just beans. I haven't tried adding onions yet, but that could be good.

Soooo good and very, very easy.  I like to stir in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 can drained sweet corn (added after pureed), garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and a little salt to the simmering soup for some added flavor and creaminess. I use an immersion blender to puree the soup. Even my carnivore boyfriend who thinks that soup should NOT be considered a maincourse LOVED it!!  YUM!!!

What an easy, healthy recipe!  It's loaded with fiber and protein, and no fat (if you leave off the sour cream...which I didn't).  I've fixed this soup twice recently, and my husband and I both love it.  It's quite possibly the easiest soup recipe I've ever made.  I reserved 1 can of the beans to add whole, but didn't change anything else.  I served it with crab quesadillas and salad for a quick dinner.  This recipe went into my "favorites" recipe book.  Thanks!

This soup is totally amazing! I used beef stock and a chunky lime-garlic salsa.  I also added extra cumin (2 tsps total) and the taste was amazing!!! This is so easy and nutritious! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!  A definite time-saver!

Omitted the cumin. Added minced garlic, fresh lime juice, and a fresh jalapeno.  Blended all ingredients reserving 1/2 of the black beans to add at the end for texture.  Served the sour cream on the table with the soup.

This is a great and easy receipe. It is so nice to say it is homemade soup and it is so easy.  Like others I puree half the beans and keep some whole.  I also change the "heat" of the salsa depending on who I am making it for.  I have added ham, corn, onions, garlic.  Everytime I have made it, everyone loves it.  I usually serve it with cheese Quesadilla's.  This is a keeper

I've been making this soup for months now.  It is great with pretty much whatever kind of canned or fresh tomatoes you have on hand.   A little coriander and cilantro goes nicely.  I like to leave one of the cans of beans unblended.

I normally like this sort of soup but I didn't care much for this.  It was oddly sweet which really distracted from the flavor.  It might be the salsa you use, since I can't think of anything else that would give it the sweet flavor.  I'd recommend getting something either fairly bland or that has a flavor suite that complements the soup.  In any case, avoid the sweet ones!

This recipe is inexpensive to make and pretty quick.  It tastes fine when 1 can of beans is left unpureed.  I recommend only briefly blending the rest,  (too much blending will make it very soupy and it ended up with a watery-gritty texture).  I topped with fat-free sour cream and green onion.  I would have given this 4 stars, but when I woke up the next morning, even my eyelids were puffy!  There is so much sodium in this recipe!!!!  Two bowls (which I had) equalled the total amount of recommended daily sodium intake.  To finish up the leftovers 2 days later, I mixed 1/2 bowl reheated soup with tons of romaine lettuce.  It was okay as a salad topping, and that would be the only reason I would make this recipe again.

Everyone who has tried it LOVES this recipe.  So easy, so good.  I make a few minor changes: I saute 1 onion and 3 cloves garlic in olive oil and then toast the cumin with about 1/2 tsp ground coriander seed in the oil/onion/garlic before adding the other ingredients.  Also I often only use 1 can of beans.  But the recipe is great as is as well.  Thanks, Maryanne, for the quick and delicious lunch fix.

Wow!  I can't believe that something so simple can taste so good!  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable and left about 1 cup of beans whole.  I also threw in about 1/2 cup of frozen corn after blending.  This soup is great served with tortilla chips.

This recipe was very pleasing.  I followed  other reviews and added 3 tsp of lime juice, fresh chopped cilantro, garlic, and cayenne pepper.  I also used 3 cans of beans and kept half of a can out of the blender.  My only disappointment was that it was not spicy enough, so next time I will pick a hotter salsa.  Otherwise, this was so quick, very delicious, and great for a comfort food on a rainy evening.

I did change this a little, but loved it!!  I used 3 cans of beans and Mexican rotel instead of broth.  Also, I added a fresh jalapeno.  I blended everything very well - leaving out one can of beans.  I simmered it after adding the can of beans.  the full beans adds good texture and the rotel and jalapeno add an added kick!!

This is one of those dishes that tastes good but isn't the best on appearances.  I recommend that you don't blend up all of the beans.  I won't add the broth if I make this again, it made it too thin.

This is such an easy and delicious idea for black bean soup!  I added some diced green chilies as well as some canned mexican tomatoes w/lime juice and a handfull of cilantro. I topped mine w/mont. jack cheese and sour cream. It was so easy and so good...It's definitely a keeper. Thanks!

An excellent, filling, and healthy dish! I substituted one can of red kidney beans for one can of black beans, added some jalepeno, cilantro, and white onion, and added one more can of whole black beans to the finished soup. This dish will not be as salty if you rinse the beans for preparation. You may eliminate the amount of salt simply by using hard beans and soaking them beforehand. After refrigeration, this soup gets thicker, and is excellent served with tortilla chips, salsa, and cheese. A great recipe to experiment with!

Excellent recipe! I thought a soup with just beans and salsa couldn't be very filling, so I added some chicken.  It didn't need it!  The chicken was tasty, but this recipe can stand on its own.  My husband would like to turn the heat up a little bit with a few extra hot peppers, but the spiciness of this recipe was about the limit for our kids -- who also loved it, by the way! Thanks for sharing.

This is great soup every time, and everytime I change something!  The first time I added chili powder and a chipotle pepper for spice and topped with taco cheese and more black beans, omitting the sour cream.  I've also blended in a roasted red pepper which gave a sweeter, smoky flavor.   Other good ingredients to add-in after blending are 1/2 c brown rice, 1/2 c whole-wheat macaroni or other small pasta, or an avocado to add texture.

can't get enough of this soup!  it is really good.  D's salsa (on this site) is a good salsa recipe to use instead of bottled because the fresh cilantro adds an unreplacable taste.  great with a dallop of fat free sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.

Oh my gosh!  This soup was fabulous!  Compared with a favorite restaurant's Black Bean Soup, both my husband and I rated this a 9 out of 10!  And this was SO easy to make.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/3 cup UNpureed beans and 2 tsp. of horseradish sauce as well.  I served it w/sweet cornbread and honey butter.  We are are so full and completely satisfied.  Thanks for sharing!

By mistake I added an additional can of vegetable broth, so I added another can of black beans whole.  WOW!  Used light sour cream and plenty of green onions.  This was a wonderful, quick recipe.  Maryanne, thank you so much for sharing.  I would never have thought of this by myself.

This is SO simple and SO good.  I changed the recipe slightly to add a bit more texture.  I set aside 1/2 can of black beans and 1/2 of the salsa. After blending all ingredients, I stirred in  whole black beans, the salsa and 1 small can of whole kernel corn.  Texture improved and it was delightfully spicy. Oh, I also added a dash of Chili Powder with the cumin.

This was so fast and so easy.  My husband thought I had been cooking it all day! HA! He just kept going on and on, and I had to contain my laughter as this was so easy to cook, and it came out so freakin amazing.  I did use very good quality salsa none of that sweet nasty cheap stuff.  I will be making this again when I need something yummy and quick.  Thanks! for such a wonderful recipe!

This is a PERFECT recipe for losing weight!!  It's healthy, it tastes wonderful and it's affordable!  I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Though I will admit that after making it exactly as written dozens of times I honestly cannot taste the difference from our "simplified" version: Fresh salsa, black beans and water in a blender.

An added bonus: it's amazingly easy to clean up after - blender, dishes and silverware rinse right off; burn the bottom of the pan and it still rinses right off; splatter it on the stove burner or counter and hours later simply wipe it off with a paper towel!

This is a great, simple recipe.  I used chicken stock because that's what I had.  I added more cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and cayenne.  A little squeeze of lime to finish it off - and it was perfection!  Great simple recipe you can build on.

Good if you add twice the beans or half the salsa. I made it as directed, but it tasted to much like runny salsa. I added and blended another can of beans, a bit more cumin and broth and it was perfect.

I have low sodium needs, so used no sodium vegetable broth and found a low sodium salsa brand as well. This reduced the sodium quite a bit. I didn't use sour cream either. I always rinse canned beans three times which takes quite a bit more sodium out of them as well.  I think this soup is delicious.  It is hearty and filling and tasty and super, super easy to make.  I love it and it will be a favorite in my rotation.

This soup is amazing!!!!!  Especially if you take BANSREEPARIKH's tip of tripling the cumin, adding fresh lime juice and cilantro.  It makes a world of a difference making it tatse fresh and more homemade.  I've made it every week for the past 3 weeks.  Everyone that's had some keeps asking when I'll be making more.

Easy recipe. Originally wasn't going to add meat but added 8 oz. chorizo. Definitely kicked it up and is perfect with cornbread on a cold day.

I ate this soup at a friend's house one evening and I just loved it  I shamelessly bugged her for the recipe until I got it.  I use an immersion blender and I leave about one fourth of the beans whole but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.   This recipe is so quick and easy to make and uses ingredients that I almost always have on hand and I make it often. It's great for unexpected company too.

This was SO delicious and easy to make! I did get the same finished product by following some of the reviewers' suggestions. I sauteed the onion in olive oil first, along with some chopped multicolored peppers that needed to be used. I processed only one can of the drained beans in my mini-processor, leaving the other can whole. I also used chicken stock for the liquid and a few good splashes of sherry. I went light with some hot sauce, because I didn't want too spicy. Made it yesterday, and today it was nice and thick. At this point I thought it could use a little more heat so added it then. Thanks Maryanne for the great starting point!

It was sooo good! Followed some review tips and substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth. I also did not purée the beans and salsa just a quick tip of the cans and salsa and it was done!!!

Amazingly yummy! I cooked my own dried black beans from the store first. I also used chicken stock because it was what I had in the house. Turned out great!

This was pretty good! I used chicken broth and about a 1/4 cup of sherry as suggested and then I only used 1/2 cup of salsa, added a clove of garlic and a teaspoon of fresh cilantro before putting in the food processor

So simple and good. Like other reviewers I sautéed some garlic and onion first, then added the beans and a can of Rotel and the other ingredients. I used my immersion blender to smooth everything out and served with sour cream and cornbread. Yum!

Super easy and very tasty.  I used low salt/fat chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Otherwise, I made just as recipe stated.  Will definitely make again.

I agree that the salsa overpowered the taste. But I tried making it again with only half of the salsa and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely good for the amount of effort involved. Of course the salsa used is very important, so choose one you like and it should end up fine.

This soup was great!  I saved a third of the beans and put them in whole.  Also, I cut the salsa amount down a third, but could hardly even tell it was there. Next time I will use the whole amount. Fast and easy to make!

The quality of the salsa that you use will determine your finished product.  Make sure that you like the taste of the salsa that you choose to use.  Love this recipe!  I have made it several times and it never disappoints.  It is excellent for a quick and easy lunch or dinner.  It can become a completely plant based meal with the omission of the sour cream.  I have added some chunks of avocado to give it some of the same creaminess.  Healthy and yummy too!

It was so simple and very tasty. I put some onions and green pepper in the food processer and diced them up really small. Then put half in the soup to cook and blended the rest in with the beans and broth before mixing it all together. It would have been fine without the onions and bell pepper but I had them and they were going bad so I just tossed them in. Easy and had some bite with the salsa and cumin.

Delicious! Per other reviewers, I sautéed some minced garlic and onions and added it to the blender. I only puréed one can of beans and added the other one whole. I used ckn broth instead of veg. Fresh cilantro is a must! Served with cheese quesadillas.

I thought I had reviewed this recipe already but I can’t find my review. I’ve made this recipe at least 5 times and it is consistently fantastic every time. Everyone in my family loves it including my teenage sons. I always double the recipe which is good for 4-5 people. Tonight I served it with simple cheese quesadillas that I made on the stove. Lime, sour cream and maybe some shredded cheese on the side and it’s just delicious. This is one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes because of the fast and the simple, quick preparation.

Wonderful as written.  Also great to improvise and use what you have on hand.  Today I used Costco's Mango Peach Salsa.  It gave it a sweet flavor, but still a nice gentle kick. Immersion "stick" blender is so great to get it to a smooth, yet bit of textured consistency.  Just blend to the texture of your liking.  Sometimes I have also added carrots and corn.  Even creamed corn worked well.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I love that it is quick and easy.  I made a few additions based on others' comments.  For my family of six I doubled the recipe, and left 2 cans of beans whole to add texture.  I sauteed 1 1/2 -2 tbsp garlic in a little olive oil, then added the blended and other ingredients to the pot.  I used 3 tsp (1 tbsp) of cumin, a generous dash of onion powder, and also added about 1 1/2 c of frozen corn.  Just before serving I added 1 1/2 Tbsp of lime juice.  I served it with sour cream and quesadillas, and we will definitely make this again.

As is, it was OK, and I served it with a Cicken fajita salad.  The second time I made it, I spced it up with Hot Salsa and added a 3rd can of beans drained for extra substance and about a cup of leftover rice.  MUCH better for us.  I will make this again maybe adding meat and serve with cornbread as a main dish.  Just something to think about.

I just didn't feel like bringing out the blender, so i put beans in a pan and used potatoe masher to get the consistency I wanted. (I like it a little chunky) then added the other ingredients. My husband and I both loved it. Just loaded up on a bunch of black beans that were on sale.A winner!

This was AMAZING!!!  I have never had black bean soup before but I love black beans so I was excited to try this.  We did what other review suggested and added 1/2 of a sauteed onion, added frozen corn to it to make it chunkier and we also took 1/2 of one of the cans and added it after everything else was blended to make it chunkier.  I added lime juice and cheese to it once I bowled it.  Oh wow, was it good!  I made corn bread to go with it.  Will be making this many more times!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  Just made a minor alteration Sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil and added  with other ingredients.  Blended together.  Put in pot with one extra can black beans.  Added fresh cilantro.  Topped each bowl with fresh cilantro and chopped garlic.  Try a slice of hard boiled egg on top top as well.  Amazing!!

Surprisingly delicious and soo easy to make! The soup was a little thinner than I liked when it came out of the food processor, but adding 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved with water to the soup when heating up did the trick!  I take it to work I'm a thermos for a cheap and filling lunch.

Fantastic ! So simple to make. I like how you can very easily add to the recipe to suit your tastes-use hot salsa and add jalapenos for very spicy-add diced avocados-awesome ! Looks appetizing with  red,yellow and orange bell peppers sliced on top too! My new favorite soup ! Thanks.

AS SUGGESTED I BLENDED ONE CAN OF BEANS AND LEFT THE OTHER WHOLE.  I ADDED GARLIC AND A LITTLE HOT SAUCE.  THIS SOUP IS INCREDIBLY EAST, TASTY AND QUICK. TRY DJ'S SALSA RECIPE FROM THIS SITE. VERY GOOD SALSA.

Amazing soup!  I changed it alittle so it was more like a chowder and served it with tortilla chips.  I made a big batch of it so i could freeze the leftovers.
I used 1 15 oz. can tomato sauce, 4 15 oz. black bean cans, 1 54oz. kidney bean can, and 2 15oz. black olive cans.  For spices I used 1 tbsp. cumin, 1 tbsp. garlic powder, and 1 tbsp. onion powder. I puried the beans (both black and Kidney) and olives.
I put it in a bowl and added the rest of the ingredients. served cold.

Cannot believe how simple, quick, and tasty this was.  I made it last night for my picky eaters.  During the warm up I added spices to suit our tastes (chili powder and cayenne) and another can of black beans (rinsed).  The whole beans mixed into the creamy soup made for a more desirable (for us) texture.  I served it over organic brown rice and garnished with a spoonful of vegan sour cream, finely chopped green onions, and a few slices of avocado. I also mixed up a quick batch of Vegan Agave Cornbread Muffins (so good!) from this site.  I'm so impressed with the ease of this recipe. When I got home I preheated the oven, tossed rice in the rice cooker, mixed up the cornbread and popped in the oven, placed soup ingredients in the blender then transferred to the stovetop... While it warmed and the cornbread and rice cooked, I diced green onions and sliced avocado. In about 30 minutes I had a hot, delicious, nutritious, vegan meal that everyone loved.  This recipe will be in regular rotation!

This was seriously amazing. My husband is vegetarian and I am not, so finding a soup that we both love is hard. This was delicious, healthy and few ingredients. We used 1 cup of super hot habenero salsa fresh from the farm down the street. Delicious. Tons of flavor. I was really suprised how easy it was and tasty. Definately a keeper. I don't like green onion so we garnished with some cheddar sprinkles, fresh tomato and avacado slices. Next time, I'm going to add a can of corn (not blended).

to be honest i didn't really care for this soup. It wasn't bad it needed some spice tweaking, but after blending it alltogher tasted like salsa.. I do think however mixing this soup up and putting it in a crockpot with velveeta it would make an awesome chip dip

I tried the recipe as is, and it was fine.  I needed to make myself dinner since the family was out and this is a very quick soup that can be easily made with things I usually have on hand.  For that reason, I gave it three stars, but the taste was a little bland in my opinion.  Next time I try this I will try some of the suggestions to pump up the flavor.

So good, I made a couple changes....used chicken brooth vs veg since it's all I had.  Added a splash of hot sauce, used Trader Joes Double Roasted salsa (the best jarred salsa ever!).  Sautéed 3/4 of a white onion with tablespoon of minced garlic in olive oil for 5 mins, added small can of corn, sautéed another 5 mins.  Added bean mixture, juice of one lime and simmered 45 mins.....it was fantastic!!

Super easy recipe, only took me 10 minutes to put it together. I sauteed garlic and onions then added the broth. Also, when I blended the beans, I set some aside so there was some whole beans in the soup. Also added frozen corn. Overall, very tasty soup done in a jiffy!

I tried this recipe as the original and again with reviewers suggestions.  It was 10 times better with the addition of 3 TBS lime juice, doubling the cumin, and leaving 1 can of the black beans whole.  I also added a jalepeno to the blend which gave it medium heat (not too hot, just right).  I left out the garlic.  5 stars with reviewer's version.

I have made this recipe several times, and it has turned out well every single time! I like it more spicy than the cumin and salsa allow, and so I add some taco/fajita seasoning to the mix on the stove as well. I also like to top it with some fresh avocado--adds some coolness to the heat of the soup. For more of a Mexican flair, I make some thin cheese quesadillas to dip in the soup--delicious!

5 Stars for Easy & Tasty!  I used 3 cans of BB, added some garlic, 2x the cumin, and 1/2 C. frozen corn.  Was really good.  If you're going to add in a bunch of other ingredients (like chicken, tomatoes, corn, and other stuff)  and have more time, you should try the "Slow-Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup" from this site.  I think I like it just a hair better, but you really can't beat this for how quick and easy it is.  I made it and ate it in peace, all while my kids napped :-)  Great recipe.  Don't eat if you have big plans the following day though, like traveling, errands, client meetings, etc....if you catch my drift!

I did as others suggested and only pureed part of the beans.  I thought the soup had a little too strong of a salsa taste so I added an extra can of beans so that my mixture was 3 cans pureed and 1 can of beans in bean-form.  Also added enough chicken broth to get the soup to soup-consistency rather than pintos-and-cheese consistency.  I added brown rice at the end and that created a more complete protein for my vegetarian child.

My kids liked it a lot.  Anyone could tweak it any number of ways, but it is a great, simple base to work with.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't find the basic recipe super flavorful, so I added a lot more salsa, tripled the cumin, and added a few tablespoons of hot green chili powder. I also added another can of whole beans.

Much more flavorful than I expected. I kept one can of beans whole per other reviewers' suggestions. I also added a bit of garlic powder and a splash of lime juice. Instead of a whole cup of salsa, I had to substitute half a cup of Rotel and half a cup of salsa. Served with sour cream on top and cheese nachos.

This was really good. Even my six year old liked it. So easy to throw together. Great for a quick week night supper with warm rolls.

Wonderfully yummy!! As suggested by previous reviews, I used low-sodium black beans to eliminate too much sodium. I used pico de gallo instead of salsa. This is very, VERY easy to make and the taste is absolutely delicious ... better than any restaurant black bean soup I've tried. We skipped the green onions as we were very hungry, but I'm sure that will just make it look pretty. A definitely go-to recipe for cold days/nites.

Very good. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. Doesn't really need the sour cream or green onion. I ate it with tortilla chips which was super yummy.

This soup was delicious!  On the other hand, I didn't want to wash the blender, so I mashed the beans by hand.  Also I used canned tomatoes with green chilis.  So suffice it to say that this recipe was an excellent starting point.  (Please let none take offense at this.  I rarely follow recipes precisely.)  I served with tortilla chips and shredded cheese.  Supper was extremely salty; but that might have been caused by the chips.  Leftovers for lunch were excellent with extra chopped tomato!  The next time I might substitute red beans or 1/2 red beans and 1/2 black.  The possibilities are endless.

This is so tasty, and so easy!  I only made two minor changes - left one can of beans whole like other reviewers said, and I sauteed up some garlic and onion since the salsa I had on hand was pretty bland.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

For a quick & easy soup, this was really good. Next time, as others have mentioned, I'll add another can of beans, or even shredded chicken for more texture.

Definitely quick with plenty of flavor, but really just average compared to most of the other easy black bean soup recipes out there.  Also, definitely turned out thick, even though followed the recipe entirely except for leaving about 1/2 a can of beans whole, rather than pureeing them all.  I might make some variation on it again, but I wasn't wowed like I feel I should be for a 4.5 star recipe.

I defiantly loved this. I altered for 6 servings and left one can whole. Also added a little salt and pepper and jalapenos, cilantro and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Next time I make, which I'm sure will be soon I will had some chicken to make it more filling. Thanks so much for the recipe I LOVE SOUP!!

I just started on the south beach diet and needed something hearty - but not w/ bread/pasta/rice.  This was the fastest snack I have ever made and was really tasty.  Used fresh homemade salsa and topped the soup w/ a little cheese and extra salsa and sour cream!  Awesome

It was great.  I made it twice, the first time I upped the cumin...bad idea.  The second time I stuck to the directions but went w/ a slightly less Salsa and it was awesome.  I use chicken broth.  Easy, tasty and healthy-a rare combo.

This had an excellent flavor, and not just because it was easy to make (which it was) -- but because it was genuinely a nice combo of flavors. I did add jalapenos to mine before using the immersion blender, and I served it with co-jack cheese. I mixed the sour cream in because I like sour cream IN things but can't stand it ON things. Thanks for the recipe--this is one that's worth making a big pot of dried beans up for! (This really is no more than 4 servings -- it was enough for 3 very large bowls full.)

I LOVED this soup!  It's tasty, filling and healthy!  I took the advice of the top reviewer here and added the juice of 1 lime, about 1/4 of cilantro leaves, tripled the cumin to 1 TBSP instead of a tsp, added a little jalapeno, and added some sauteed onions before blending.  For texture, I also reserved about 1 cup of the black beans and added a little more sauteed onion and about 1/2 cup of corn.  We topped ours with the sour cream (low-fat), a little green onion and some more cilantro finely chopped.  My boyfriend and I loved it, along with our "Pollo Fajitas" from this site.  Thank you, Maryanne for the awesome base.

Ahhhh I thoroughly enjoyed this. Didn't have salsa so I used a can of diced tomatoes with bell pepper & onion, added 1/4 cup chopped onion and some garlic powder. I used beef broth and some grease from a hamburger we made...that gave it a good rich flavor. Garnished with corn chips and feta. I'm going to add this to my soup rotation!

This soup may look unappetizing but man is it good! Like other reviewers, I saved some beans to add in and give it more texture. Unlike other reviewers I have never worked with this type of bean before and added the extra beans in while I was cooking and they turned to mush anyway...doesn't matter, still tastes great. I did add some corn in because I love corn! This tastes just like a tortilla chicken soup I used to eat almost everyday from a restaurant down the street from my work. I can't believe how easy this was! Will make this again and again.

DELICIOUS.  A few small (but amazing) changes.  1) I added 10 blended up spanish (green) olives.  2) Instead of leaving some of the beans out to add texture, I just didn't blend the salsa.
3) I mixed the sour cream into the soup and added a bit of cheese on top.
Was to die for!

this was really good!  Fortunately I read the reviews first and altered the recipe accordingly.  My biggest change was using dried beans, as we are a dried bean kind of family! Wound up with around 6 cups beans, which would be about three cans rather than two.

This *sounded* good but in the end I thought a bit on the boring side, especially when I was working a second bowlful of it.  Yes it was very easy but that's about all.

This is my go-to meal.  I'm sure the other reviews offer great add-ons to this basic recipe, but it's also perfect as is.  I use an immersion blender.  I cook for picky eaters and this has won over everyone.  Adding the green onions and sour cream makes it just as good as any black bean soup I've enjoyed in a restaurant.

Outstanding!!!  My wife loves black beans and she raved about this when I made it.  I made this as written, but increased the quantity to make six servings.  This gave me the extra can of beans to add whole as other reviewers suggested.  The whole beans don't change the flavor, but they do add a nice texture to the soup.  We used fat free sour cream and it added a surprising depth of flavor without the extra calories and fat.  The sour cream and fresh green onions really put this simple recipe over the top!

Great soup, especially with a little bit extra salsa in it. Served it with a dollop of sour cream on top. Be careful though, even the slightest bit extra of the cumin will drown out all of the other delicate flavors of this soup!

Delicious!! I went with some of the suggestions: saute onion and garlic in the pan before you add the soup.  I also put carrots in the chopper and added those as well.  I added the sour cream to the soup instead of putting it on top. Will make this again and again!!

I thought that this soup was very easy.  But turns out I am only a fan of black beans in chili.

Super quick, super easy, and super good!!!  I doubled the recipe for three of us and we each had a nice BIG bowl of soup as our complete dinner.  Since we are all on South Beach, this was a perfect dinner!

I loooove this soup! I did listen to the reviewers and I added the juice of 1/2 of a lime, a lot of fresh cilantro, more cumin, and I sauteed fresh garlic and onions and threw those in there as well. I then fried some corn tortillas and shredded them and placed them on top of the soup! Delicious!

This recipe was super easy and very tasty.  I did make some adjustments though.  I used dried beans instead of canned.  I blended 2 cups in the blender and left one cup unblended. I sauteed half a red onion, 1 jalapeno, and 4 cloves of minced garlic and added that to blender along with the salsa and 2 tablespoons of cumin.  i also added 1/4 of a teaspoon of chili powder. I cooked it for about 20 minutes letting it get thicker.  I put 1/4 cup of brown rice in the bottom of the bowl, piled on the black bean soup and topped it off with cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream a tablespoon of corn, a tablespoon cilantro and a tablespoon of green onion.  Lets not forget the avocado!  Delish!

What can I say except for WOW!! This was a great dinner quick and easy. My family loved it and it is a meal that will be made again. Make sure to add fresh garlic, cilantro and a little jalapeno pepper. I would definitely add another can of beans but keep them whole. We really like black beans and thought 1 cup of whole beans was not enough. Don't forget to top it off with some sour cream cheese and avocado.

I was very disappointed with this recipe!!  I wish everyone had rated it by the actual recipe rather than their own additions.  The recipe as-is is very bland.  If you choose to use this recipe, be sure to follow the changes people have made, it won't make YOUR review a true review of the recipe though. I may make this again with everyone's suggestions.

This recipe is tasty as is but the flavor was a little flat for me.  I sauteed some bell pepper, jalapeno and onion and then threw that in the blender with the soup.  That addition made this soup just perfect for me.  Really fast and good.

Another satisfied customer! Made this soup tonight and all my people LOVED it, including a 4-yr old, two 8-yr olds, 17-yr old and my husband! Made it exactly as the recipe states. We topped ours w/ shredded cheese and sour cream. Yummy recipe and SO easy! UPDATED 2/26/09: New favorite alteration to this recipe. Add 1T. lime juice, 1tsp. garlic powder and small fist of fresh whole cilantro to blender along w/ other ingredients. YUMMY! Can't get enough of this soup! I've made it four times already!

Simple, tasty, fun.  Great with fresh salsa from the garden and a little fresh cilantro sprinkled on top.  Will keep this one in mind for a quick, easy dish.

I make this all the time and it is so simple and delicious. You really can't go wrong with it. It is also really high in fiber and low fat (especially if you use low fat sour cream). Really awesome!

I have been looking for more meatless recipes to try to save a little money and thought this sounded good. It was good. I did what others did and only pureed 1/2 of the beans and 1/2 of the salsa and put the rest in whole. Next time I will put double the amount of whole salsa in for more texture--I like chunky soup! I used Southwestern style salsa that had corn and beans in it.  I served it with Mexican blend shredded cheese chopped cilantro, and tortilla chips.  My 1 1/2 year old like it!

Two words - AWE SOME!! This was quick, simple, healthy and delicious.  I followed some other suggestions on the site and made as listed (skipped the topping) and both ways were excellent.  This is such a great recipe to modify if you want to spend a little extra time - or calories, but is also wonderful as is.  This is a new favorite!

Five stars for simple. Five stars for tasty. Five stars for a recipe that makes me look good in the kitchen for little effort. Changes/enhancements: used dry beans not canned (cooked ahead), substituted chicken broth, sauteed some garlic/onion in butter and added that and corn (per reviewer suggestion) to pureed bean mixture. Served with cheese quesadillas. A keeper.

I just whipped this together in 5 minutes for tomorrow's lunch.  I used chicken broth, and reserved 1 cup of beans (as others posted) before blending with a hand-held immersion blender.  It worked great.  I then added the reserved beans and a can of corn.  It is fantastic!  I think it will be even better tomorrow when all the flavors have a chance to blend. Great recipe, thanks!

I am constantly trying to find easy HEALTHY & flavorful things to cook. THIS is awesome! I made it exactly according to directions - except I added a touch more cumin as I love the smoky flavor - and it is a low calorie, fat-free delight! It took maybe 5 minutes to make and I will certainly be making this often! Thank you for the submission!!!

Good light lunch option.  I gave it 5 stars for easy assembly and good flavor with double the cumin and a bit of cilantro. Next time I would use a spicier salsa.  The garlic and onion saute' was a must.  I wouldn't add as much lime next time.  I did 2 TBSP and it seemed a bit too lime-y.  NOTE: Made this a second time, following the recipe exactly.  It was very good this way.  No need for extra ingredients after all.

This is a really quick version of black bean soup and it is good.  I added a couple of extra ingredients (but I did try it before I tweaked it; I just like more spice).  I added a jalapeño, a little more cumin, and some chili powder.  I also topped it with mozzarella cheese in addition to the sour cream and green onions.  I served it with tortilla chips.  Delicious!

Wow- so good!  It's like eating a black bean dip, but in soup form.
I only have a small food processor, so had to mix the ingredients in 2 batches.  This didn't effect taste though, as it was still great in the end.  To anyone who has a small processor, too, you can save some room by not adding the chicken broth until you put the soup in a pot to warm.
Once the soup is served, I added pieces of avocado and tortilla chips, both of which I thought tasted great with the soup.

This soup was so easy!  It came together real fast in a blender.  I took the advice of others and added some lime juice, and left some beans to be added whole.  I used  fajita seasoning instead of the cumin, and added some cheese when I ate it.  Excellent.  

The one thing I'm unhappy with (and not the recipe's fault) is that most of the flavor comes from the salsa (makes sense).  Next time I make this I will get some garden fresh salsa or something, because I'm not a huge fan of sweet jar salsas.

Absolutely delicious and took only minutes to put together!  I used chicken broth because that's what I had.  Served with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese with sour cream and fresh cilantro on top.  Fabulous meal in minutes!

FABULOUS!!  Being a college student, I loved the ease of this recipe!  I did what others said, adding 3 teaspoons lime juice, triple the cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic, freshly chopped cilantro, but it was a bit salty with the veggie broth.  Next time I'll try it with just water.  I also crushed tortilla chips over it to add some crunch!

This is really good--very close in taste to a restaurant's soup I love. I followed others' recommendations and used 2 cans of black beans blended plus 1 add'l can of black beans non-blended. I also sauteed sweet onions and garlic first. After all ingredients were in the pot, it was thinner than I like and since we were starving and not wanting to wait to cook off some of the liquid, I added corn starch mixed with water to thicken. MISTAKE. Do not do this--it made the beans all clump together and was a mess. Stirring constantly got them blended back in but I won't do that again. The next time I made the soup, I added in a can of refried black beans and that did the trick. No clumping but thickened up perfectly without altering taste. We found refried black beans at Publix. This is definitely a staple in our dinner line up now!

For people who want to use *dried* black beans: I soaked 16oz of dry beans overnight. I boiled them in a large pot of water for 30 minutes, and found it was enough time to make them tender enough. However, I think 16oz of dried beans is too much for the 4 servings in this recipe. I would bring it down to 8oz of dried beans. 
This recipe was fantastic! The salsa and veggie broth made it very flavorful. I added cilantro to the blender, because I am a real cilantro lover. I put low-fat sour cream and fresh cilantro on top. This was fabulous. I'd make it again and again. Though I think using canned black beans would make this MUCH easier- dried beans were a pain.

My roommate and I loved it!  A super fast soup to make, and very filling.  I took the suggestion of another reviwer and reserved a 1/2 cup of beans to add back whole in the saucepan.  I also spiced it up with about an 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, a dash of garlic powder, some mexican seasoning blend, and a table spoon of finely chopped onion (from the Avocado Tacos we made from this site).  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was so good, fast, and EASY.  I used fresh black beans instead of canned.  I also added garlic and chili powder.  And, I only pureed around 3/4 of the beans in the blender...the other 1/4 or so I left whole so that the soup would have a little more "substance".  My daughter said I HAVE to make this again...soon!

Love this recipe!! I leave out the sour cream and top with some chopped tomatoes! Great low fat, low cal, high protein dish! It's so filling you can have it as a main course! Even my 3 year old likes it. Hubby asks for it too and it's sooo fast to make, I didn't change a thing with the spices, although make sure you use a good type of Salsa, as that makes all the difference. My son and hubby like it topped with some shredded cheese (jack or cheddar) and some broken tortilla chips.

This was fabulous! I substituted with low-sodium chicken broth because that is all we had and couldn't find our cumin anywhere so added tsp.chili powder instead and also 1/2 tsp of both garlic powder and onion powder. Lastly, I added about a cup of frozen corn. This will definitely be a regular at our house! It is SO EASY! Thanks!

I'm a new vegetarian, so I'm constantly trying to new recipes. This recipe was quick and easy, and delicious! I used three cans of beans (I pureed two cans in the soup and added the third can of beans whole). I also doubled the cumin. All in all, fast, easy and delicious.

Quick, simple, inexpensive, healthy and YUMMY!  Who would've thought just a few ingredients could make such a delicious soup!  I put just a little less broth in and pureed about 3/4 of it, I didnt add the sour cream or green onion and it was wonderful!  It would be good with tortilla strips sprinkled on top.  I'll be making this soup regularly, thanks for the great recipe!

I tried the soup again....this time with Sarah's salsa!  I added 2 cups of veggie broth and pureed half of the bean and broth mixture, then I probably put 2 cups of Sarah's salsa in.  Even better than the first time I made it.  You've got to try this soup!

HOLY COW!  I didn't expect this recipe to be so incredible!  My kids, ages 11 and 8, even loved it and raved about it.  We added crushed tortilla chips as a topping -- I mixed the sour cream into each individual bowl before serving.  Definitely only puree one can of beans, and add the other to the soup in the pan for heating.  YUM!

Great start! I used 4 cans of beans, one package of fresh Anna's salsa (made here in Austin) and blended that together. I also put some chicken breast in a pot with cumin, a little salt, garlic, oregano and chili powder, covered with water and let boil for an hour or so. Then I turned up the heat and shredded it while the liquid boiled out. When most of the liquid was gone, I added the bean mixture and added just enough broth to thin it out a bit without making it too runny. Then I served it over white rice and topped with queso panela, pico de gallo and fresh avocado - tasted like something I had in Merida, Yucatan!

Highly recommend for a quick and easy dinner. So fantastic and SOOO easy.  Only had 1 can of black beans so used it with a can of red kidney beans.  Turned out great.  Next time I may throw in a handful of corn and some fresh cilantro.  Easily adjustable to your family's tastes.

We love to use this soup as the base for adding our own ingredients - we always start a frypan with browning 1/2 chopped onion and minced garlic to taste (we use a large spoonful).  Add your black bean mixture from the blender along with a can of drained whole kernel corn, and a few squirts of lime juice.  To make it extra hearty and tasty add 1/2 lb browned chicken sausage, chunked.  Heat until warmed throughout.  If desired, serve over rice sprinkled with your favorite cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Delish!

Fantastic soup! Easy, fast, cheap, GOOD!  I made the recipe as is but didnt have veg. broth so I had to use chicken broth.  Also, I added frozen corn about 10 mins before we ate it. We will be eating this often.  Thanks!

This is one of those "I'll-never-tell" recipes.  People think that you slaved to make it, but in reality it only takes about 5 minutes to prepare, and 10 minutes to fill your home with an amazing smell that makes people think you've been slaving away in the kitchen.  Serve with the Mexican cornbread!

I have made this soup dozens of times.  My husband and I love it and it is incredibly easy to make.  I skip the sour cream and often blend the onion with the beans and add some cilantro as well.

I loved this soup!  It was soo simple to make, and so fast! I loved the Sour Cream on tom, but would leave off the green onions, the texture was not complimentary.  I would add extra broth to make it a bit thinner.(I used a soup base broth not canned) My husband would prefer 1/2 the beans to be unblended.  Neither of us are big soup eaters.  I havent stopped thinking of this soup since I made it two weeks ago.

Excellent flavor! Consistency was thick-ish, kind of like a gravy/stew. Very easy to make.
Made the following modifications and would recommend them: (1)reduce veg. broth to 1 cup (2)add a third can of beans, not pureed, to soup (3)add one tsp. each of cilantro, chili powder and garlic (4)serve over rice (our personal preference) and top with green onions, salsa and sour cream.

Wow this is good.  Amazing for a recipe with so few ingredients.  I was certainly skeptical but I figured what the heck because I like fiber-rich food and I can my own salsa so I have plenty sitting around.  I made it with zero alterations and couldn't get enough.  Thanks for such an EASY, HEALTHY and DELICIOUS recipe.

Great recipe! It was too runny so will cut down on the broth next time and add another can of beans. I pureed one can of beans and left the other whole. I also added in 2 tsp of chili powder, a dash of garlic salt and a couple shakes of oregano. I didn't have green onions so I used about 1/4 cup of chopped onions into the soup mixture. We love onions and could eat them in and on anything almost. Hubby added black pepper to his and after the first bite quickly asked if there was more for him to have a second bowl! We topped the soup off with shredded jack and swiss cheese. This is a quick, great tasting recipe and was most appropriate for this rainy and dreary east Tennessee winter day.

This was so quick and easy! I followed a reviewer's advice and only blended half the mixture to leave it chunky.  I also added some corn, and topped it all off with pepper jack cheese and sour cream.  Yummy!

Very easy and delicious!  I added a third can of whole beans for texture, and I added lime juice and cilantro.  I had chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, also.  This is a great recipe that is easy to have on hand and make at the last minute!

Added 1 cup of brown rice, skipped the blender and just mashed the black beans a little.  It made a very thick and delicious soup.  Also substituted a diced yellow onion for the green onion, and it worked fine.  Great with a spicy salsa, if that kind of thing is your bag.

i think this should be called "knock your socks off black bean soup"  It was the best, most simple recipe that I have ever tried.  I used the lime/cilantro salsa by Pace also and added a 1/2 t. lemon curry.  It was divine and I really impressed my dinner guests.  Thanks for sharing.  We need more simple recipes such as this.  It was totally gourmet!

Good idea for a soup.  I didn't have enough black beans so I used only one can and one can of cream corn with one can veggie broth and some salsa.  Wish I had some sour cream to put on top...would have been perfect because my salsa was spicy!

I served this over a scoop of cooked white rice and added shredded cheese and sliced  black olives along with the sour cream at the end. Next time I'll add a bit of cilantro, and maybe serve sliced avocado on the side. An excellent quick meal that tasted as good as similar dishes that took a lot longer to make. My husband loved it.

I used kidney beans and chickpeas instead of black beans, and it worked equally well.  It turned out lovely!  Will most definitely use again.  Thanks for posting!!!

As some reviewers suggested, next time I make this, I'll save some of the black beans to put in the soup whole, just to give the soup some texture.  You can adjust the seasoning to taste.  I'll try 3/4 tsp cumin next time as my husband doesn't like dishes that are too spicy.  I also may double the recipe as someone said it freezes well.  If you make a double batch, just combine the beans, broth, salsa & cumin two separate times in the blender, as one batch pretty much fills up the container.

Just tried this recipe today.  Made a terrific lunch along with cornbread muffins.  Rather than using the food processor or blender, I just put all the ingredients in my sauce pan and used an immersion blender to combine.  This way you can leave the soup as chunky or smooth as you like.

This was the easiest soup recipe ever.  I used my home made salsa to make it.  It took no time.  We all had seconds including my four year old.  I will definately make it again although I would not say the taste was "company grade".

I thought this soup was great. I made it with my boyfriend's super hot homemade salsa, so to cut down the heat we crumbled tortilla chips in it. Next time I am going to try it with a milder salsa.

This recipe is so quick and so easy and absolutely delicious.  I took the advice of other reviews and added some whole beans after I had blended the other ingredients.  It gave the soup a great texture.  I also took the advice of others and made D's Famous Salsa to add in which gave the soup a very fresh taste.  This soup is great and I'll be making this for years to come.  Thanks Maryanne!

I love this recipe!  I use a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of salsa.  Along with canned black beans this recipe is sooo easy.  I have found that I don't need to add any spices because the diced tomatoes are so spicy all ready.  I make this once a week and eat it within two days it is wonderful!

This was very easy to make.  As another reviewer commented, I would next time add some black beans that were not processed to give it a little texture/interest.  I was also making some nachos supreme at the same time and drizzled some of this rather thick soup onto the chips and that worked out great.  Thanks Maryanne!!!  Nice Job!

A few weeks later:  my girlfriend brought two coworkers home for lunch and being that one of them was a vegetarian I thought of this fantastic soup - well, they both asked for the recipe!!!!  I think the proportions are on the smallish side for 4 people though, you might want to double it.  This time I bought Progresso black beans in 19.5 oz cans and used 1/3 of the beans without putting them in the food processor.  Again, Thanks!!!!

I can't believe how good this is. I was very skeptical, but after all the rave reviews I had to try it. Delicious. I did saute some minced garlic before adding the bean mixture to the pan. We served it with sour cream, chopped avocado and toasted corn tortilla strips on top. Wonderful!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  It was fast, easy and very flavorful, especially with cornbread on the side.  I gave it five stars, except with regard to children.  It might be a bit spicy for tender mouths, but this could be adjusted by using a extra mild salsa.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I enjoyed this soup very much.  I also think you could add anything to this "basic" soup.  I added an additional can of black beans after processing.  I think in the future I might add onions, or even thin the soup slightly and add rice.

Super easy! I needed more than 4 servings so I bumped up the recipe a bit. 3 cans of beans, 2 cups of broth, 1.5 cups of salsa, and 1 Tbls. of cumin. I substituted chicken broth for the veggie broth, and I will use cilantro instead of green onions in the future. I also garnished with jack and cheddar cheeses and also some avocado. I will definitely make it again since it was so fast, easy, and filling.

This was super easy and quick to make . We are trying to eat less meat so decided this vegan friendly meal was a good option . As others mentioned I added black beans to give it more texture. I saved 1 cup black beans & added a whole can or drained corn . My picky husband liked it . Only thing I would do different next time is add some crushed tortilla chips on top . I omitted the sour cream since I didn’t have it . Great with corn

This soup was truly delicious – in my own opinion. My kids found it too spicy, or were afraid to taste it… their loss. I definitely plan to make this again. So fast, so easy, so satisfying! 
I’ve made salsa in the past by cooking diced tomatoes, diced onions, garlic, and a bit of s’chug (super-hot hot pepper mix). So I simply added those ingredients to the soup pot, figuring everything’s anyways cooking together for a bit. Skipped the onions. 
Beans: 1 can (15oz) ‘vegetarian beans’ (i.e. white beans in sweetened tomato sauce + dash of vinegar)
Salsa: ½ can diced tomatoes (i.e. 14 oz)
+ 1 clove garlic (frozen cube)
+ 1/3 tsp s’chug (was too much; max ¼ tsp next time)
Cumin: 1 tsp cumin
Broth: 2 cups veg broth (lightweight vegetable soup, left over from another day)
Other: 1 tsp salt. Also 1-2 tsp olive oil (because my baby, standing on a stepladder, helpfully handed me the bottle, so I thanked him and used a little.)
Brought to a solid boil, then blended thoroughly. Added two handfuls of chopped broccoli (such a great item to have in the freezer) and reheated for just 5 min. Served with a dollop of greek yogurt.

Delicious!  In addition to the ingredients listed in the recipe, I  added chili powder, fresh lime juice,  cayenne pepper and chicken.  Very satisfying without the added ingredients as well!

I didn’t put the ingredients in the food processor and let the broth cook down until it looked almost like chili. topped with shredded cheese and served with tortilla chips. Super good!

My husband and I love this recipe! I’m even starting to give it to my 9 month old and he loves it too! It’s wonderful as is, but sometimes I add a shredded chicken breast and an extra can of whole black beans, bring all of it to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes. That just gives it a little extra body. However, it is delicious either way.

A great soup! I used homemade pico de gallo in place of the chunky salsa. Truly quick and easy.

I loved everything about this soup--so economical, easy and tasty! And you can tweak it however you want to make it have more flavor, add in some meat, etc. I didn't even dirty up the blender. I just mashed the beans with a potato masher right in the pot, then added the salsa and mashed some more. Then I added all the rest of the ingredients. It had a nice, not too chunky, texture. I added cayenne pepper and leftover chicken to my husband's serving, and he ate it with Fritos. Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved this soup.  I made it with some slight tweeks:

I blended 2 cans of black beans and a few jalapeno's for spice.  I used 1 can of whole black beans, added whole kernel corn and sauteed sweet onion, garlic and the green onion to my pot.

absolutely wonderful!

I actually made it as a chili - I did not puree. I also added ground venison. But it was great - the salsa was a great change from tomatoes for a chili.

Simple and straightforward recipe that was easy to prepare and tasted great! I wasn't sure how to prepare the green onion as garnish/additional flavoring at the end and my girlfriend wasn't as partial to the amount of sour cream recommended, but these were minor details. The soup went over great otherwise!

I listened to other reviewers and added yellow onion, 1 seeded and minced jalapeño, minced garlic, doubled the seasonings, used 3 cans black beans (1 can reserved and left whole) and substituted salsa with rotel tomatoes.  Everyone loved it. Was a little spicy. Was perfect for a gloomy fall day served with grilled cheeses.

Easy, tasty soup. Added 1 TBSPN cumin, 1 tspn of smoked paprika, one onion and used 3 cans black beans (pureed 2, left one whole).  Whole family enjoyed.

I gave it a 3 star because my husband actually liked it, but I have to agree with cooker20.  The salsa did not blend well and pretty much hijacked the flavor of the soup. I think I will keep looking for a black bean soup recipe.

I love this easy basic recipe. This time I added some garlic and more cumin. I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of spicy black beans. I pureed 1 can and left the other whole...same with the salsa 1/2 and 1/2. No matter how you make this soup, it always turns out great! 20 mins to 1/2 hour? I'm in! Thank you!

It's very good but I made some modifications to fit my own preference. I left one can of beans whole and reduced the broth by 50% because it's was thin.  Also didn't rinse the can that was blended because it helps with color.  It's great over rice as a side dish.

I used a fresh salsa that had cilantro. I also added the second can of beans after blending to give the soup more of a bite feel to it. Instead of vegetable stock I used no salt added chicken stock.

This soup was fantastic. I did make a couple modifications. I sauteed some onions and garlic then added the vegetable broth, 3\4 of the black beans and half the salsa.  Once it was warmed through, I used my immersion blender to smooth it out. I then added the rest of the black beans and salsa. I topped it with crushed tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, scallions and jalepeno.  It was a great soup on a cold winter night. I will definitely make this soup again.

I thought this was a delicious change to taco night! I ended up making this as a side dish rather than a soup.   I had extra time so I simmered it on low for 2-3 hours to thicken it up a bit more so it presented more as a side than soup.   I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had. Still tasted great.

Easy to make and healthy to eat! Like other reviewers, I first sauted some onions. My version used canola/olive oil with a little butter. After about 8 minutes, I then added 2 cups broth with a sprinkling of granulated garlic and a splash of hot sauce. When that was bubbling I added one  19 oz. can of black beans, 1/2 cup of salsa, 1 heaping tsp of cumin, and a bit of leftover brown rice. Just bring this to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes. Then puree with an immersion blender, add about 1/2 cup of thawed frozen corn and heat through. I needed to add about 1 tbsp of bottled lime juice to make it "just right." Didn't need sour cream.

This is so easy and delicious. It's the perfect quick meal after getting home late from work. In addition to the green onions and sour cream, we like to top it with shredded cheese, avocado, and tortilla chips.

What a surprise! I didn't expect this to be so good since it was mostly from cans/boxes.  My changes: 3 slices turkey bacon diced and sauteed, chicken stock instead of vegetable broth ( I always use boxed stock over broth), used 1 can fat-free refried black beans and one can whole beans, a can of corn, and lots of fresh cilantro at the very end. I didn't have to emulsify. Served with light sour cream.

We love this soup!   We used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  We also added in some sausage we had leftover from last night and blended that into the soup with a handful of cilantro.  Delicious!

Save one cup of beans to add whole, add 3 teaspoons lime juice, triple the cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic, freshly chopped cilantro and 1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper.

Easy and delicious!  I only got 3 servings.  I prefer a more rustic soup so decided not to purée it.  I used a fresh salsa (from the deli section), increased it to 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cans of black beans (all low sodium).  Since my chosen salsa had no onion and garlic I sautéed some of both.  I added the beans and broth, and  added salsa until it was spicy enough.  Once it had simmered a while I used a potato masher to smash half of the beans.  The texture was just as I like it and I didn't have to clean my blender!  I added some corn at the end, but will skip that next time.  I could have added more broth, since it was quite thick.  I served Mexican blend cheese on the side, which was a nice substitute for sour cream.  This was a big hit with my guest!

I used Bush's reduced sodium black beans, Swanson veggie broth, and Sabra fire roasted hot salsa. Came out  great. I almost skipped the green onions because I'm not a fan but I'm glad didn't. I usually make giant pots of whatever for leftovers to freeze and eat for a month. This is a nice, quick alternative if I want something different.

My husband first try at Black Bean soup was at a Chili's restaurant and he loved it so everything is compared to that.  So....that being said....this didn't quite make the 5 Star for him.  Even though the taste was great he didn't care for it being all mashed as he preferred the whole beans.  I did take the other reviewers suggestions about adding chopped onion and garlic...and because I had some fresh basil (and no cilantro on hand) I wanted to use up I added that and some chopped up fresh roma tomatoes just before serving.  Surprisingly that really added to the taste of the recipe.  Next time I will do it this way except just mashing 1 can of the beans and adding 2 cans of whole beans.  That should make this recipe 5 star for us!  Thanks Maryanne for an easy, great recipe.

LOVE! This is a simple and super quick meal to make before bed for lunches at work. I have altered this recipe just a bit based upon feedback from other reviews. I add a whole jalepeno and keep just about a cup of beans whole in the pot. I triple the cumin addition too. I saute a yellow onion and add that to the beans. I usually make my own veggie stock from frozen scraps, but this last time I ran out and only had chicken stock...I was apprehensive about how this would turn out. - It's good! Serving it, I add a drop of sour cream, sprinkle with sharp cheddar, a couple slices of avocado, and dash it with chipotle cholula. mmmmMMmmm...a wholesome meal that warms the tummy.

So good and so easy.  Healthy too!  I use 3 cans of beans (2 pureed, one whole).  2 cups of broth and a splash of sherry and 16 ounce container of salsa.  Mix with immersion blender.  I also add a small can of corn or some shredded chicken.  Whole family loves it!

I made this exactly as instructed (but using a stick blender) and it was so delicious and so easy. I've made it numerous times since, sometimes adding a chipotle with adobo sauce and a few cherry tomatoes. Now I  always double the recipe because it disappears so quickly. My toddler LOVES black beans and practically licks the bowl clean.

I will definitely make this again, but I think I will reduce the amount of salsa used as I found the taste too acidic (of course this will vary by which brand of salsa that you use).  After tasting it I did add garlic.  The sour cream really does add to the taste.

Great recipe! I followed the advice of others and used dried beans for lower sodium content with one cup reserved for chunkier texture. Added the juice of one half a lime and used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Just as delicious and lower calories!

This recipe is outstanding! I did, however, saute about 1/4 cup of diced onion till soft then added 1 clove of minced garlic to saute about 30 seconds. I used Trader Joe's organic free range chicken broth - very flavorful. Thank you Maranne for this awesome recipe. My husband and I both love it!

My husband loved this and good way to add more beans to your diet! I used the chicken broth and saved 1/2 cup beans to add back as was suggested.  I also used a mild salsa and a dash of garlic powder.  I buy a "seasoned" black bean instead of plain,(don't think they will let me say the brand) which may have more flavor, even rinsed, than plain canned black beans. If I had some available, I would have loved adding some cilantro to the garnish but it was excellent the way it was.  This is going to be a regular in our house!

I tossed the convenience as I had a half bag of Black Turtle Beans in the cupboard when I saw this recipe yesterday. The beans were far more than planned so the batch got doubled (I actually blended half at a time). I used chili powder instead of cumin and chicken broth vs. vegetable, just finished having the soup for lunch ... YUM!!! Lots of leftovers.

Simple, fast, delicious.  I like crumbling a corn muffin in it.  Chipotle chili pepper is a tasty addition.

We enjoy this soup over quinoa or rice!   Like other reviewers, I always add 3 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. garlic powder, a dash of onion powder, a handful of fresh cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste. It's a delicious, very fast recipe to have on hand because we can always keep the ingredients on hand (the fresh cilantro is just a bonus if we have it). And the babies gobble it right up!!!

I followed the suggestion to sautéed onions and garlic first and then to purée two cans of black beans and add a third can with the whole beans. I also added some franks red hot sauce and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. I used chicken stock in lieu of vegi because it's what I had open. This is delicious and I'm thinking about making more on this snow day!  Great flavors! Oh! I almost forgot. The splash of Sherry wine is great! I've never done that before so thank you!! So yummy and so easy!

I found this to be bland and boring, although certainly easy, especially if you have an immersion blender. It could be my own fault because I hate cumin and I left it out.  I considered trying again with sauteed onions and garlic, adding thyme and another can of beans and maybe pouring in some sherry, but decided to find a recipe elsewhere instead of essentially trying to create my own.

This is a filling and delicious soup. I used it as a side dish, but it could easily be a main dish in itself. It would also be scrumptious to add some grass fed hamburger meat if you wanted to. I also had to use a can of pinto beans in place of one can of black beans, and it still came out scrumptious. Even our 3 y.o. grandson couldn't get enough of it! That is a true testimonial!!!

Pretty basic and ok.  I'd go 31/2 stars.  It doesn't come close to any I've eaten in a restaurant.  If your looking for something quick, easy and filling, this would fit the bill.  I'd probably prefer a taco soup.  Thank you for sharing. I would make again with a bit of tweaking."edit. It thickened enough that the next day we ate it over rice with sour cream.  That was good

We have used this as a beginning to a great black bean soup.  We also use chicken broth instead of the veg. broth. And we add smoked ham to it, puree it with the beans and broth.Using a mild salsa can reduce the overwhelming flavor of salsa, as well as an extra can of beans.  It is great!  We top it with a dollop of sour cream and chopped tomatoes, and a bit of shredded cheddar.  GREAT REVIEWS from family!  Even the little ones will eat it.

Fantastic, and with all of the revisions suggested by others, endlessly varied. 
With respect to the sodium in canned beans: Can canned beans not be rinsed, thus eliminating the saltiness?

Fantastic. My changes... I didn't have salsa so I added 2 large/meaty tomatoes, 1 small onion, 1 large green bell pepper to the food processor. As well as 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cilantro. I also opted to keep 1/4 of the beans whole and add to the soup as well as 1 onion diced and sauteed. I topped with shredded mozzarella.

Very good and super easy and quick to make! My husband, who is a big meat eater, actually really enjoyed this soup, and he was impressed that he liked a recipe that was vegetarian! I served it with some quinoa on the side. Will be worth a repeat!

Wow! I made it exactly as written (except I had no green onions) and it was delicious! It made for a super easy and fast lunch soup, was only 5 Weight Watchers points per serving, and my husband and children (1 and 3 years old) wolfed it down. Will make again and again!

As is, the soup is way too watery when blended. I left one can of the beans whole and the other can I pureed. I also did not puree all of the salsa because I like it a bit more chunky. The flavor was just okay. I really wanted to like this recipe as is but it needs so much more for my liking.

Very easy to make and flavorful. I used medium fresh salsa and that added a nice kick to the soup. I used low sodium broth (150ml) and low sodium beans (250ml)to help to reduce the salt per serving. Also I wanted the soup to be vegan so I omitted the sour cream. This soup would also be good over some rice with a salad for an easy hardy lunch or dinner.

I used dry beans as that is what I had, so it took a few hours to make.  It turned out fantastic.  I added some jalepeno pepers and onions to it after blending and after the initial serving, I reduced it down to make a wonderful dip for chips.

sauteed garlic and onion to add to blender.  reserved 1 cup of beans to add whole.  Added a can of corn, drained.  Added an extra teaspoon of cumin - maybe do less next time.  Added a splash of lime juice.

I followed it as written and it was a little too salty. I drained the beans, too. Next time I will add a 3rd can of beans and maybe cut the broth with some water. The salsa adds a lot of flavor.

Very easy to make! Make sure you love the taste of the salsa you use because that's going to have something to do with the soup's flavour. I used Ziggy's Salsa from President's Choice here in Canada because it's my favourite salsa .... and it was awesome. YUM!

After a couple of minutes, the soup started getting really thick, and lost the flavor of the delicious salsa. When I had a spoon of soup while it was boiling, I thought it was much better. Overall, this was okay, but I'm going for another recipe next time.

My go-to easy, flavorful soup for a quick, low carb lunch.  Definitely add more cumin, lime, and cilantro per the reviews.

We love black beans and we love salsa.  Even after rinsing and draining the beans this soup was way too salty, for some reason, even though I didn't add any salt.

This was amazing!  I was a little nervous about serving this to my family I will admit, but it looked and sounded wonderful to me.  Glad I went with my gut on this one. My husband and 10 year old son loved it as much as I did.  WOW! took me a whole 15 minutes to throw together, but made one minor change.  Threw it all in my soup decanter, or fancy soup serving bowl and put it in the oven when I got off work.  Let it warm at 275 for about 30 min. because my husband was running late. Also made Fruit salsa with cinnamon tortilla chips, recipe on AR also. Yum!

Seriously good and easy. I only had chicken broth on hand, and used my favorite pico de gallo (it has a lot of liquid in it, so I guess it's more a salsa really). Anyway, I agree with other reviewers that the salsa overpowers the beans, which is fine with me, plain black beans are meant to be spiced up in my opinion. Anyway, a very fast side dish.

Loved it!  However , I added a can of "Amy's" Lentil soup and some cilantro plus garlic.  I skipped the sour cream too !
Also I like texture to my soup, so I smashed one can of the black beans instead of pureed , and added it just before cooking it all.

Overall a very tastey recipe.  Made it for a large group and it quadrupled nicely.  I did half the salsa and added Rotel for the other half.  Added salt too.  Yum.  Thanks for sharing!  AND this is the fastest making recipe on the planet!  Instant supper!

Very good, incredibly simple to throw together for a quick dinner. I made a few changes: I sauteed a small white onion with a tablespoon of minced garlic in the pot with a smidge of olive oil before adding the bean mixture.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 cans of beans for blending and left 2 cans whole... I like chunks!  I used Tostitos salsa and didn't think it was overpowering, but definitely better the next day.  Will make again and add some lightly seasoned ground turkey.  Try it!

Amazing.  I did the same as others and kept 1 can of black beans whole instead of blending it.  I also didn't have veggie broth so used chicken broth.  Such an amazing yummy soup!!!  Made with quesadillas and dipped them in.  Thanks Maryanne!

This is a great soup to make when you are short on time!  I made this recipe exactly as indicated, but I left a quarter cup of whole beans in the soup.  It's excellent even without the toppings.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is superb. It's perfect as is. I used a bag of dried black beans, soaked overnight then drained and boiled in fresh water the next day until soft. I didn't have fresh salsa so I used canned diced tomatoes. The only other change I made was to substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth since I don't eat meat. This soup is absolutely scrumptious!!! I served it with basmati rice (but any rice will do) to make a perfect protein. It's excellent!! Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I thought this was really good and simple.  I did make it more complicated by using dry black beans (rinsed, soaked and cooked) and making home made salsa and low sodium organic vegitable broth.  I also made at least double the recipe because I love home made soup and having leftovers.  Served with cheese quesadillas.  This would prob be a very good dip if cooked down more or by omitting some broth and adding cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am always looking for new recipes because one of my daughters doesn't eat most meats. This was super easy, and delicious. I used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth but that was the only change I made. My daughter's comment is that I now need to make this once per week. I will defintely make it again!

Pros: Easy to prepare, cheap, and nutritious.  Con: Lack of deliciousness.  Taste improved with extra sour cream, hot sauce, and crumbled tortilla chips.  This is the first recipe I've made from this site that failed to live up to its rave reviews.

Excellent! I followed some of the others' suggestion to save some of the black beans. I also sauteed some onions and garlic to add into the mixture before heating. Instead of sour cream, I added cheddar cheese. YUMMY! Thanks a lot for sharing this. :)

this soup is now going to be a staple in my house. My partner and I both loved it! So easy to make, and soooo delicious. We added a dollop of guacamole with the sour cream. We didn't have any green onion, so we omitted that. Perfect east meal for a cold night. We ate the 4 servings between us in one sitting, so double the recipe if you are actually cooking for 4 people. 
This is fantastic with corn bread!

This is fantastic!!  I used rotel instead of salsa and kept some of the black beans (I used low sodium ones) whole.  Added about double the cumin.  This is fast, easy, and delish

So good, especially for how easy it is!  Adding cilantro is a must- purée with bean mixture.  I sautéed onions and garlic in pot first, then added bean purée.  Added one extra can of whole beans.  Garnished with sherry, sour cream, green onions and hot sauce.  Delicious!!

This was good. First it was simple and all the ingredients are on hand. I did saute onions and garlic in olive oil and add to the blender. I too left the second can of black beans out of the blender. We serve with sour cream,shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled tortilla chips.

SUPER simple, fast and delicious. My boyfriend and I loved it and the only change we made was to add more salt. 

A little tid bit - we used medium salsa and it gave it a good spicy kick that got balanced out from the sour cream. Also, we used fresh salsa instead of the bottled, processed stuff. It work much better for blending.

Everyone loves this soup, and it takes about 10 minutes to make (a winner in my book). Following some of the other comments, I like to saute half an onion and a couple of cloves of garlic to throw in, and a dash of habernero pepper sauce gives it a nice kick.

Easy, cheap, & a great starter recipe. So much better with a little garlic & onion though. I skip the broth and just do water. You can't tell the difference & it's a little healthier.

Not only tasty but REALLY simple to make. Just dump four ingredients together!
I sauted some jalapeno with extra cumin first though. Then added beans, broth, and salsa! No blending. Yummo!

I love this recipe - tasty, quick and cheap! I tried several ways to tweak it to make it better and the only way that has worked for my palate is to lose the sour cream but add a can of drained sweet corn when it's on the stove. Adds a bit more flavor and texture.

I have a cousin who introduced my to Panera Bread's black bean soup  and so when I saw this recipe I decided to try it for her.  I did saute an onion and added garlic powder before adding the beans.  I used 2 larger cans of beans that I found in the Latino section of the store.  Since I had more beans than was called for I added the whole can of vegetable broth and the whole jar of medium heat salsa.  Whoa!  It was too hot.  I mashed it with my potato masher until I got the consistency I wanted.  But next time I'll use mild salsa.  My cousin, my husband, and I did think it was very good, and I thought it was very easy.  She didn't say if it tasted like Panera's, but she really like it.

This soup was great. I used low sodium black beans and vegetable broth to make it a bit healthier. I also reserved about a quarter of the salsa and beans from the blender so the soup would be chunkier. Next time I think I'll only blend half of the ingredients, because it was still a little too smooth for me.

awesome! great flavor.  did not need any extra seasoning.  i used "mrs. renfro's hot habenero salsa" because i LOVE spicy.  i also added a can of corn after blending for some nice texture.  next time, i might even add a can of corn AND an extra can of beans after blending, to have more "solids" in there.

Easy, fast, and yummy.  This is one of my weeknight staples with mushroom and spinach quesadillas.  I use hot salsa and add a chopped up jalepeno  in the blender for some kick.

I never follow a recipe, but I do get suggestions from them and then tweak them a little. With this one, I cut the recipe in half, used whole black beans, added about 1/2 c of freshly cut cilantro, chicken bouillon instead of vegetable broth, plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and added about 1 tsp of freshly cut jalapenos. I garnished the top with a sprinkle of shredded cheese. VOILA! It turned out so good!

This is a great recipe...so quick and great if you are watching your caloric intake as well. I used chicken broth and light sour cream instead but it's still great.

This soup was one of the tastiest and simplest I have ever made. It was very creamy without any unhealthy ingredients. This would also be great as a dip simply by adding less broth. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

You can not get any easier -- and so yummy!  I used reduced sodium black beans and no salt added veggie broth.  Used medium salsa and this had a nice 'zip'.  I also reserved some of the beans to add in after blending.  Turned out GREAT!

The first time, I made this recipe as written. Simple, easy, no complaints. The second time, I took other reviewers' suggestions: fresh lime juice, chopped cilantro and a little jalapeno. Delicious! I strongly recommend these additions. They make for a fresh, bright, tangy soup. Don't forget the sour cream - it really rounds the flavors out. Great recipe!

Fast and tasty. I also added some beans left whole, added garlic powder, lime juice and increased the cumin.  Oh and I added some frozen corn and served mine with sour cream and cheese crackers (cheese melted till turning crispy then cooled) and quesadillas for my husband and kids.

A very nice base recipe, but it needs some tweaks.  I used some desert pepper company mango salsa, tripled the cumin, added 10 dashes of franks red hot sauce, threw in some powdered pepper (cayenne, arbol, jalepeno).  I also added some sauteed pepper, some flake garlic, and a can of whole kernal sweet corner.  Followed the reviews to blend 1.5cans of beans and left the other 1/2 full.  I think a 3rd can would be better will try that next time.

Mediocre - could be done much better if done from scratch (use independent ingredients instead of salsa as a shortcut).

Easy, quick, and good.  I used 3 cans of black beans instead of 2 and didn't blend the one can.  I also used a chipotle salsa that had chunks of corn in it I just pulsed that in the blender to make it a little less chunky.  Turned out great.

Saute 1/2 c onion, 1 seeded jalapeno, 1/4 c red bell pepper, 1 clove garlic until tender. Blend 2 cans beans, salsa, broth, and onion mixture. Add 1 can whole beans, 4-6 dash Tapatio hot sauce, 1/2 juice of lime. Heat. Top with sour cream, cheddar, and green onions.  Eat with chips. Delish!

With a few modifications, this recipe is definitely 5 stars.  Using the handy-dandy serving calculator, I increased the recipe to serve 6.   Of the 3 cans of black beans, I left one can whole for texture in the soup.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable (that's all I had on hand), and added about 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (just for a little kick).  Not only is this soup incredibly easy to make, it's super-delicious and healthy! :~)

I have made this twice  the first time i made it by the recipe  this time I made it with chicken broth since I didn't have vegetable, and I sprinkled with Mexican cheese. I also added a full small bottle of a very tomato heavy salsa. It was amazing. The extra salsa really made it more flavorful and it is pretty easy to add at the end if you think it needs it. I think the type of salsa changes the flavor alot and is a heat way to experiment.

This is literally one of the easiest recipes I've ever made!  It also happens to be really inexpensive and taste great!   The *only* little changes I'd recommend are to triple the amount of cumin added and save some whole beans for texture.  Five stars, for sure.  Bravo!

So tasty and so easy to make!  The ingredients are simple and they come together quickly.  I doubled the cumin (personal preference, I really love that stuff) and used hot salsa.  To make things easier I used my immersion blender and mixed it all up right in the pot.  I will be making this a lot.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

The dish was delicious, but I heated mine b/c it didn't suit my family's taste buds served cold.  I microwaved it for a minute and 30 seconds.  It was yummy and only took seconds to make!

Super easy.  Tastes great.  I doubled the beans, almost doubled the broth.  Left 1 can of beans out of the puree to add back in to the soup.  Also added diced ham.

Good.  As well as quick and easy.  Next time I would do the following:  Double the beans (1/2 puree, 1/2 leave whole), double the cumin, leave the salsa unpureed.  I also like someone's suggestion of serving with some cooked brown rice.  I like the quick and easy aspect, as well as the small list of ingredients that are usually on hand.

We loved this soup. Made minor changes. I used Chicken broth, because I didn't have any veggie broth. I added a whole green pepper. I did not run any ingredients through the food processor. I just rinsed the beans and dumped all the ingredients into the pot at once and cooked it. It turned out great. It was so good. My husband even loved it and he is not a fan of black beans

Awesome and simple but flavorful soup.  I followed the tips of others and made it all in one pan (with immersion blender instead of food processor) and also added the extra cumin.  I would have added cilantro if I had it but didn't.  Also, I don't think it made any difference but I used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1 cup of vegetable broth because I was just trying to use up some leftovers.

Very good as is, especially if you are looking for something extremely simple. I made this in 5 minutes for lunch today. I did add a good deal  more cumin than called for (because I like the flavor) and a dash or two of chile powder.

We were not particularly impressed with this soup.  Hubby took one bite and said simply, "tastes like black beans".  Next time, I'll just make my kicked up black beans.

Super easy to make and very tasty.  I used Trader Joe's hot chipotle salsa and it gave the soup a nice kick.  I doubled the cumin and I only blended one can of beans and added the other can as they were when I was heating the soup up at the suggestion of other reviewers.  With a little salt and pepper and some freshly squeezed lime juice everything was balanced perfectly.  When I eat the leftovers later today I'm going to add some cilantro too.  Thanks!

Pretty good soup, especially given how quick and easy it is to make. I like to top it with sour cream, shredded cheese, and sliced green onions.

This recipe is so easy and very good. I have found myself starting to like black beans since being married to my husband, who loves them. This is an easy way to add some flavor without digging through the spice cabinet. Very simple and tasty. Mix, heat & serve. I made this with the Salsa Chicken recipe and some cilantro lime rice. We've eaten that meal a few times already in the past month.

I didn't change a thing and am giving it 5 stars not because it is the most amazing soup you'll ever have BUT because it is really, really tasty & healthy and I was able to make it in 3 minutes before going to work today.  Doesn't get any better than that for busy people!

Awesome, hardy soup! I did as everyone recommended and added all the other ingredients in. Corn, lime juice, spice, cilantro, sherry, sautéed onion and garlic, extra can of black beans (not blended). YUMMY!

Great to take to work to reheat.  Even better with cilantro sour cream!  Can be made with very little fat and naturally high in fiber.

Super simple, and delicious in about fifteen minutes. The flavors are WAY more complex than anything else you think you could get in this amount of time. A great idea using standard pantry items!

Great!  Kids even liked it. It was quick, flavorful, and fairly easy.  I would recommend keeping some whole beans for texture, or sprinkling in a generous portion of crushed tortilla chips.  Even rice in the bottom of the bowl would be good.

Good.  I added an extra teaspoon of cumin and still could have used more heat.  It was good though.  Served with lowfat shredded mexican cheese on top, lowfat sour cream and chopped red onion.  Yum.

This is a staple in my house! My hubby loves it and it is so easy to make. If I'm not in a rush I take others suggestions and I saute onions and garlic first and use 3 cans of beans, adding one at the end so it is not pureed- and don't forget to add hot sauce too! When we first moved into our new home, and I didn't have any food or appliances, I dumped everything in the pot and used a potato masher to mash it up. It was great!

This soup is amazing!  I don't blend it though because I like chunky stuff. The recipe is versatile enough to add extra ingredients into like corn, peppers, etc. to spice it up and make it your own recipe.

Made this as written and it was delicious, though a little thinner than I expected. Next time I will cut the stock by 1/2 cup and simmer it uncovered.  (I like thick soups!)

This was good, but it didn't wow me.  I had to use chicken broth instead of veggie broth (we were in the midst of a snow storm, so there was no way I was going to the store).  I did as some other reviewers suggested and left 1 c. of beans whole.  I liked the ease of this recipe, so I will try this again but next time I will add some garlic and use a hotter salsa.

WONDERFUL! And soooooooooooo easy!!!! I made it even easier... This morning I put some black beans with water in the crock pot to cook all day. This afternoon I added the salsa and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Voila! Perfecto! I also added a bit of cheese on top in our bowls since we didn't have any sour cream, but I'm sure the sour cream is great.   When I do this next time I will add a dollop of plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I use that in place of all sour cream. So much healthier and you can't even tell the difference.

This was a great soup!  As other suggested, I sauteed onions and garlic.  For the salsa, I used 1/2 cup red and 1/2 cup green salsa.  Added a little white wine.  Served with a dollop of greek yogurt and cilantro.

I made this for a friend recovering from an illness, and she loved it.  It is quick and spicy.  When I made it for myself, I cooked the beans for a while to make them softer, then put everything in the blender.

I read the prior suggestions and did the following: sauteed some onion and garlic, added two cans of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies, chicken stock and warmed. Added following seasonings: cumin, cayenne. Pureed in pot with hand held thingamajig (my brains not working too well now!), and then added one can of whole beans and cilantro. Served with dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese, and Tortilla chips. So delicious and good for you!

I must say this is THE BEST soup I have EVER tasted. I LOVE spicy foods and this is just amazing!!! I used my own homemade salsa. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and 3 cans of beans instead of 2. I added 4 cloves of garlic, a little onion, 1 can of rotel, lime juice, cilantro, ground red pepper, and 1 seeded red chile pepper to the blend. Then I added a can of corn and the extra can of beans to the saucepan while heating. I topped it with sour cream, green onion, and shredded cheddar. WOW! I expected it to be good, but it was awesome. I would give it 10 stars if I could! Thanks! This is definately a keeper!

I just made this for the first time and followed the recipe exactly.  I'd say the taste was 4 stars but it was SO easy that I'm giving it 5-- i think I can make the flavor better by using a better salsa and starting with some sauteed onions.

This was DELICIOUS! and very filling. I added some frozen corn, green onions and peppers (none of these were pureed). I also did not puree some of the beans. It would be quite easy to add some canned chicken if you did not want it to be vegetarian (I would definitely have to do that if I had cooked for my entire family).

I made this tonight and it was a hit with my husband and two sons, even the youngest, my picky eater proclaimed, "This is the best Mexican soup I've ever eaten!" I also gave four stars because I modified it with several changes, but the base recipe is awesome and so easy to make! Thanks for sharing! I served with cheddar cheese corn quesadillas to make it gluten free as well. I minced some onion and garlic and sauted in olive oil, substituted chicken broth and increased to 2 cups, and stirred in about a half cup of frozen corn.

Amazing!!! Best soup I've ever had! I added a little more medium salsa for more bite and a can of sweet corn and a can of whole black beans for texture. It was wonderful.

I love this soup and so does my son.  I do use chicken broth instead of the veggie broth and I add a handful of fresh cilantro to the mixture when I put it through the blender.  As my son likes it a little chunky I don't put both cans of beans through the blender.  This soup is really fast, almost as fast as opening a can and very delicious!!

I always appreciate a simple, easy and of course, tasty recipe...and this is one of them!  Like others, I've sauteed onion/garlic added cayenne, cilantro and added some rice and shredded cheese with each serving.  Very satisfying and adaptable.   After making it a couple of times with medium salsa, I decided to try hot salsa and this made it even better!

This was the best black bean soup I've ever had. The only salsa I had was a Mango salsa, which ended up giving it such a nice taste. I actually think when I make this again (and I WILL make this again!) I will have to make sure I have the Mango salsa in house. My kids are gobbling this up as I'm reviewing it right now! I also can't believe how easy it was to make...always a plus on a school night! Thanks for sharing, this is definitely a keeper!

Had this tonight, and it's really tasty and quick.  I did let it simmer longer than the recipe says to thicken up.  I made changes based on necessity, rather than just to change the recipe.  I used beef broth in place of veg cause that's what I had.  I also didn't have salsa, so I subbed a well drained can of Rotel, then added a little onion, garlic, and cilantro to make it more salsa-ish.  I used the immersion blender to get this pureed but still chunky.  I garnished with shredded cheese as well as sour cream.  This will be made again, as it was just the right amount of spicy and very flavorful.  Thanks for an easy weeknight recipe.

OMG! This has got to be one of the easiest, tastiest soups I have ever made!  I did make some changes, but I would not even have thought of the starting point if it had not been for this recipe! Like a few other reviewers, I sauteed about 1/2 small onion, diced, and about 2 tsp chopped garlic. I used chicken stock, because that is what I had, and made sure to rinse the beans thoroughly before adding to the pan. The salsa I had on hand was quite mild, so I added about 1/8 tsp chipotle pepper powder with the cumin.  We like really chunky soup, so instead of using the immersion blender, which I thought I would do at first, I just used the potato masher to get the consistency I wanted (less splatter, too!).  For a change, you could add some fresh or frozen corn, some shredded, cooked chicken (or both), but it is great without, too. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This was one of the easiest and most delicious soups I've made to date! I will for sure be making this again - I will probably cut the salsa down a tad so the soup will be a bit thicker. I know a lot of people say they like to leave some of the beans unblended but I blended the whole thing and thought it was perfect.

I rarely award five stars to a recipe because I think reviewers hand out 5 stars a little too promiscuously on this site.  Many of my high ratings are compromises--for example, it's healthy but isn't superb tasting, but I rate it highly because it's tasty for a healthy recipe.  this recipe has everything--it's easy to make; it's healthy; it's delicious.  I sautee some diced bacon and reserve it--use a tablespoon of dripping to sautee half an onion, and reserve.  Add a splash of key lime juice before prosessing.  after processing I add reserved bacon and onion.  Wonderful!

I followed the recipe except for a few things: held back on some of the broth and instead added the juice of one lime. Tossed in some chopped up cilantro and seasoned it heavily with cayenne pepper, chili powder and tobasco sauce because I like a little heat. I served it with fish tacos and put out topping that could be used for the tacos or the soup: cheese, sour cream, avocadoes, green onion, cilantro, tortilla chips, etc.  SO easy - this is going in to my regular rotation.

I, too, made several changes. The original recipe is a great starting place for a really fantastic and healthy soup. Besides adding a green and red pepper and a red onion, I also added chipotle peppers from a can of adobe sauce. That really gave the soup an earthy, smoky flavor. For salsa, I used "Green Mountain Gringo" Roasted Garlic flavor; fantastic!!!

ADD freshly choped tomatos before serving! GREAT RECIPE!  I did use previous suggestions of  sauting garlic and onions to add before heating black bean mix.  I also added an additional can of whole black beans to blended black beans, trippled the cumin and added hot sauce.

This is a great base for black bean soup.  I sauted the onion and garlic with a quarter green and red bell pepper.  Also added mexican chili powder, give it a little more kick...I like it spicy.

I used chicken broth instead, which doesn't keep it vegetarian. Also, I withhold some of the beans and add them in after pureeing them for extra texture.

This recipe is so good!! I can't believe how easy it was. I have made black bean soups which called for triple the amount of ingredients and took at least triple the amount of time to prepare, and I thought this recipe was a million times better! Next time I will leave a cup or so of the black beans whole, but other than that I would not change a thing. THANK YOU!!

I have to say that I am not a huge fan of vegetables but I love salsa....go figure! This recipe allows me to get some veggies in without even thinking about it. I love black beans and this recipe is a nice twist to the traditional black bean soup. Coupled with the ease of preparation, I'll be making a lot more!

What a wonderful, quick recipe!  I followed the wise advice of others and sautéed three chopped cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil and then blended everything together in the pot with a hand blender to save on dishes.   I had 19 oz. cans of beans and they worked just fine — I blended one in and kept the other aside, so half the beans were whole.    I used three teaspoons of cumin and added a teaspoon of lime juice — I'd recommend using freshly squeezed lime juice.  

This was delicious, quick, easy, and I usually have all these ingredients on hand — I love this recipe!!  Thanks so much.

Oooo - YUM. I pureed one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans with the other ingredients, then added cooked bacon, onion and another can of whole pinto beans. I also put in a little hot sauce for kick and black pepper. But it is good in its original form too!

A hit with the family.  I added some grilled onions and perhaps a bit more cumin.  Love how simple this is.
Also, served it with plain yogurt and lime wedges.

Excellent! I can only echo what those before me have said - this recipe is so easy, so healthy and so delicious! 

I was fortunate enough to have some homemade salsa left over from the weekend. The salsa was strong on lime and cilantro and blended nicely with the other ingredients, so next time I will likely add some lime juice and cilantro. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. 

You can't go wrong with this recipe.

The soup is super easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I took the advice of  another reviewer and added another teaspoon on cumin, cilantro, and cheese and it was a hit with my family.  My husband has asked me to make this recipe part of our regular meal rotation.

This recipe is so fast and so tasty. Instead of sour cream and green onion, we add avacado, chunks of mozzerella, fresh lime juice, and crushed tortilla chips. Wonderful!

So simple and so good!!  I used a smoky salsa which had great flavor and only blended 1/2 the beans and 1/2 the salsa.  Added garlic and used chicken stock, just enough to get the consistency I was looking for.  My husband said that he would have liked it to be chunkier, so next time I am going to add some diced tomatoes.  Very easy to modify to your own taste.

Quick and yummy meal.  I've been making this recipe for years, after seeing a similar version in a magazine.  It comes together in about five minutes with ingredients most people keep in the pantry, and it can be adjusted for taste using hotter or milder salsas.

WOW!  Super yummy soup that you can actually feel good about eating.  Plus it takes only about 15 minutes to have on the table.  I followed the advice of prior reviewers and added some fresh garlic and lime juice and an additional teaspoon of cumin as well as reserving 1 cup of beans and adding them whole to the blended mix.  This paired perfectly with cornbread!  UPDATE:  I added a whole bunch of cilantro!  Nice addition!

Quick, easy and tasty. The salsa added quite a bite. I food processed 2 cans of beans and added a 3rd can of whole beans and some chopped green pepper for body and interest. Also upped the cumin to 3 teaspoons and added 1 t cayenne, 1 lime, 1 garlic clove before blending. Served with multigrain chips and a colorful salad. My husband enjoyed this a lot. Thank you.

My husband and I really loved this recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I added cayenne pepper, fresh cilantro, lime juice, and more cumin.  I also added onion before I pureed this.  I also recommend leaving 1/2 of the beans out of the puree, and the sour cream is a must.  It was kind of thin for our taste but we crushed tortilla chips and added them in at the end with a little cheese on top.

This was a wonderful soup in its own right, and an even better jumping-off point for a more elaborate meal.  I added a little tomato sauce, some adobo, a few more spices (I recommend garlic and Mexican oregano), and leftover shredded pork, and it was one of the best soups I've ever made!

This recipe is magnificent!  As someone who's stove cringes upon my entry to the kitchen, I was wonderfully surprised to find how easy and foolproof this recipe is.  Like others here, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable but that was the only modification.  My toddlers gobbled it up and it even passed my mother's taste test when we met for lunch the next day!

This soup was so delicious and easy!  I made it right in the pot with the help of an immersion blender (with only a few splatters here and there), doubled the spice and added some lime juice.  It was too spicy for the rest of my family, but I'll be making this all the time when I'm on my own!

Awesome soup whether prepared exactly as given in the recipe or embellished. If we desire a heartier meal I sometimes add gr. beef (or diced chicken) with taco seasoning. A sprinkle of chopped jalepeno is another great addition. I also do a milder version with a black bean/corn salsa & an extra small can of corn.

This was REALLY quick, easy, and delicious. I used low sodium chicken broth because I didn't have veggie broth on hand.  Also, I saved about a quarter of the black beans and added them after I pureed everything else to give it a little more texture.  It was great with crusty whole grain bread!

I made the dish exactly as stated.  It was good but not excellent.  To me, it tasted like I was eating chip dip but with a little more extra flavor and thinned out.  I might leave out the water and eat it with dip next time I want to eat black beans.

So easy to make and so yummy!  I made D's Salsa from this site to use and it was perfect.  Also added 1 1/2 c corn, 1 1/2 c salsa and 1 c of veggie broth.  Will totally make again!

I had to make some changes to this recipe. My cans of beans were 19 oz. I didn't have any vegetable broth so I didn't drain the beans (liquid in cans added up to 1cup). I added half a cup of water. 2tsp cumin. I added 1 cup corn to the saucepan and sprinkled shredded cheddar on top. Next time I might use less water (veggie broth) so that I get a bit of a thicker consistency.

This has been a staple in our house for years now. Even my non-vegetarian husband *loves* this soup and asks for it a lot! He and my son like to sprinkle a little mexican cheese over the top of their soup instead of onions or sour cream.

We always make extra and freeze it for lunches. It's awesome!

So easy, and so good! Tortilla chips make excellent crackers in this soup.

I followed other reviewers and I sautéed 1 onion and 2 tablespoons of garlic, along with about 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. I used 3 cans of chicken broth and three cans of beans (puréed about 1 1/2 cans and left the rest whole). I also doubled the cumin, and threw in a can of corn at the end. Great soup!! I made double so I can freeze it and take it to work.

Very good soup!  I saved 1/4 beans to add after blending the rest, and added 1/2 can of hominy for some extra texture.  Very good soup.  My husband was leery at first... but ended up eating 3 bowls!  Definitely will make again.

This recipe is fantastic.  Very quick- Took me about twenty minutes, and that includes clean up.  It's also a great base recipe.  I made mine with cilantro, jalapanoes, corn, and canned tomatoes (I didn't have salsa).  It was amazing.  Next time I'll toss some left over chicken on top, and maybe use more beans, as I like my soup a little thicker.  This is defiently a recipe to try again and again.

AWESOME recipe. So easy and delicious. Followed it to a T, except for the food processor part. I just blended lightly with a handheld mixer. Worked like a charm, keeping most of the beans in tact while also thickening up the broth. 

Thanks!

Pretty good with some modifications...make sure to leave a can of black beans whole for added texture, and do not blend your salsa either.  I used garlic/lime salsa and it was really good in the soup.  I also added quite a bit of garlic to the soup and several squeezes of fresh lime juice.  This is really good when paired with Cuban Midnight Sandwiches from this website!

Very good and very easy.  As other reviewers suggested, I added corn and a squeeze of lime juice.  I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a pretty good soup, although I did add a couple things, notably a big handful of cilantro, 1 tsp of cumin, 2 more cloves of garlic, and 1 chopped jalapeno before blending.  I added 1 cup of frozen corn and another can of whole beans after blending and heated through.  Very filling stuff and very comforting and tasty.  Will make again.

This is a great little herbivore-friendly recipe! All the ingredients are already in the pantry, and it's delicious and super quick. I blended in a jalepeno and some lime juice, and also added extra whole black beans and corn kernels for texture. Was nice with the sour cream and green onions. I slapped together a cheese, jalepeno, and mushroom quesadilla to dip in the soup -- a real keeper for weeknights!

Delicious, even though I forgot the cumin!  I used On the Border salsa, and served with cheese quesadillas.

*Update:  Made again today, didn't forget the cumin this time; however, I didn't have salsa, so I used a small can of tomato paste.

This recipe was SO easy and delicious!! It literally took 1 minute to put together and then just a few minutes to heat. I added an extra can of black beans (left whole) and a can of corn to the pot. Served with sour cream, shredded cheese, and tortilla chips for dipping. THANK YOU so much for this recipe, we loved it!

This soup is extremely easy to make and tastes excellent!  
When I made it I made a couple of changes; I added in another can of beans (whole), a quarter of a jalapeno and a handful of cilantro.

Good base recipe. I recommend making it once as the recipe states and then deciding what you think it does or doesn't need. I tried some suggestions from previous reviewers and it ended up being a little too overpowering. You don't want to lose the great flavor of the beans. Next time I will probably add 1 tsp. of cilantro, 1/2 tsp. of cumin, 1/2 tsp. of lime juice, and of course reserve 1 cup of whole beans. This was quick and easy. We loved dipping cheese quesadillas into the soup! Yum!

This soup is delicious! I altered it a little,like some others. I used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 veggie stock,tripled the cumin(which i'm so glad i did),put 1 can of whole beans,added some chili powder,lemon juice, garlic, and fresh cilantro. My husband is a meat and potato kinda guy, so i decided to crumble some hot Italian sausage in it too.....but i will be making this soup without the sausage too!! Again this soup is YUMMY, thanks for posting ;~)

This was so simple and I had dinner on the table in less than 5 minutes.  I took the suggstions of others by doubling the cumin, adding a little lime juice and reserving some whole beans to stir in right before serving.  I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth granules and water.  It worked great!  This is definately a new family favorite.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic and a snap to put together.

I found that I needed a little less liquid than the recipe called for (I just reduced it for some time to make it less watery). I found it tasted best the same consistency as a thick lentil soup rather than, say, a chicken soup consistency.

Adding a little bit of finely chopped cilantro near the end makes the recipe really stand out.

This is an absolutely excellent dish. The only (well, actually it kind of changes the entire dish, but I'm still rating it 5 because I would have never made it without the original recipe) change that I made was instead of BLACK beans I used KIDNEY beans. I usually have to double the recipe because 1 of them gives you near to nothing. 

Also, I usually blend only half of the beans and the other half I put in there whole to give it some texture.

This is DELICIOUS. Everyone in my family loves it and asks for it all of the time.

I had my doubts, but this tastes so good for being so simple!   I used a medium flavor 'chili and lime' salsa this time and it was even better!  I always cut flour tortilla shells into wedges and throw them in the oven drizzled in olive oil - perfect for dipping!

I didn't add the onions or the sour cream and this was a good soup w/ mexican food. I simply put everything in the microwave and pureed the soup w/ my hand blender (my stove top was full). Great recipe.

this is great! only change i made was to save some whole beans to add to the heated soup, and i garnished it with a SMALL amount of shredded cheese.  very impressed, esp. when picky husband said it was as good as something you'd get at a restaurant.    will definitely make again.

I thought this was best when I added a pinch of garlic powder and let it cook long enough to soften the salsa and thicken the soup.

So simple and SO flavorful. I added a handful of leftover cilantro and a splash of hot sauce it was wonderful. A really good dish for a weeknight when we get home late, because it's quick and easy. Thanks!

This was soo easy and tasted like more work went into it than really did. It was very filling. I didn't change a thing and served it alongside chicken quesadillas. I will definitely make this many more times.

I thought this was very tasty and I felt very healthy eating it.  The green onions are a must for flavor and texture but I could take or leave the sour cream even though it makes the dish LOOK nicer when served.  Next time I think I will blend most of the beans and then leave some whole for a little more texture in the soup.

This was a very yummy soup that was very quick and easy.  I did substitute 0% plain greek yogurt for the sour cream for a healthier less fattening soup. I will definately make this again.

My husband & I LOVE this soup.  It's not only delicious, but super easy.  This soup is fun to play with.  Depending on our moods and what is in the pantry, sometime we add garlic, jalapenos, more cumin, corn and fresh cilantro.  Enjoy!

This was an excellent soup. Even my picky 4 yr old ate it up.  Suprisingly because it is not the nicest looking soup, the flavour is great though.  I also added garlic and left about 1/2 cup of the beans whole for texture.

Super easy to make and pretty tasty.  It's missing something.  Maybe a little more salsa or something.  But all in all a very good soup and it took about 10 min to make

So simple and very good.  I used my immersion blender and only partially pureed the beans in the pot and added the salsa in whole.  Next time I'll probably use a different salsa as it was a bit sweet (mango salsa).  To compensate I added a little more salt.  Also, even though I love cumin, I think next time I'll use a little bit less.  Less liquid, too, because it was a little thin, probably because my cooked black beans (not canned) still had liquid in the container. Great concept and so healthy!  Thanks.

I love this soup, it was FAR better than I expected! The only thing to be aware of is that the look of blended black beans is not very appetizing, especially when you add corn to the mix... :) Barring aesthetic issues, it was phenomenal, my whole family devoured it.

If I could I would give this recipes 10 stars, it is really delicious.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth but I think water would be just a good.  I didn't use the sour cream, mainly because I didn't have any.  Thank you Maryanne for a great recipe.  Irene

We make this all the time at my house and we practically inhale it. Followed other reviewers' advice and added lime juice and chicken; the result is heavenly! It is one of our favorite meals.

This was great!!!  The only thing I changed was I sauted garlic and onion before hand and put the rest of the ingredients in after that.  Then I used a submersion blender to get to the right consistancy.  YUM!!

This was so great and easy!  Loved the taste from such lo-cal ingredients.  I served with FF sour cream, reduced-fat shredded cheddar and green onions.  Didn't puree all of the beans because I like a chunkier texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so simple. And I found the best part to be that you can make it for one person if you need to. I used only one can of black beans and bascially a whole can of veggie broth depending on who soupy you want it to be. I prepared my own homemade salsa and topped my bowl with shredded cheddar cheese and green onion. DELICIOUS!!!! Very easy!!

I can't rate this recipe because I made so many changes to it. I thought I had all the ingredients on hand but then... I actually used Caribbean black beans that I didn't know I had but they already have peppers, onions, and lime sauce in them. I only blended one can and left the other as is. Then I added chives and left out the sour cream. Didn't have vegetable broth either so I used chicken broth. I thought it was really good but it was even better with tortilla chips crushed up and grated cheddar cheese mixed in!

Reliable, hardy, easy, healthy, quick, delightful. Great recipe that I'll use a lot. On the recommendation of others, I added 1/2 the beans whole, and also some lime juice. Both good ideas.

It took mere minutes to make, my husband loved it and asks for it again and again. We're not vegetarians, but this soup is tasty and filling. It's a heck of alot easier and just as good as the 5 hour black bean soup I used to make.

I thought this was good.  The only change I made was instead of using cumin I used part of a packet of Fiesta Ranch seasoning mix.  I think that made it even better.

This was delicious, easy, and super fast.  I would definitely make this again!  We didn't have any green onion, so that was omitted.  Next time, I wouldn't blend all of the beans, as others have suggested.

Easy and SCRUMPTIOUS!  What more could you want?!  I used chicken broth instead of veggie because I added in some shredded cooked chicken.  I also added in cilantro.  Next time I'll throw in corn with the chicken at the end when I'm warming it on the stove.  The sour cream added in at the end was a must have but I skipped the green onions... I'll definitely make over and over- Thank you :)

Excellent! I love black beans.  I think I'm addicted to this soup. I used low-sodium black beans and fat-free sour cream and it turned out great.  I’m going to try it again tonight with tortilla chips and ground chicken.  BTW: A blender works great as a substitute for a food processor.

Great Recipe!  Easy, Fast and Filling.  Three great reasons to try this recipe.  I blended all of the beans, but i did it with an immersion blender.  Doing this left it much more brothy, but if you let it cook for longer than necessary, it gets thicker.  We ate it like a chili.  I poured it over rice, or Homesteader Cornbread which is on this site.  This is a very good combonation.  Enjoy!

This recipe was so easy and very tasty! I left half of the black beans unblended for texture. I will definitely make this again! I topped it with shredded cheddar and sour cream.

This was super delicious!  I'm always looking for low fat, low cholesterol meals and this fills the bill (if you omit the sour cream).  It's fast and easy.  I use low sodium black beans and the medium hot La Victoria Cilantro Salsa.  I add about 3 tablespoons of cooked brown rice to each serving to add texture and heartiness.  This one is a winner!

Followed the recipe closely except for leaving a 1/2 can of beans whole.  I think this made the soup a little thinner that I liked so I just simmered it longer until it got the the right thickness.  It was quick, very easy, used minimal ingredients, is very healthy and most importantly, tasted awesome!  Deserves 6 stars- can't wait to try it as a dip.

This is truly one of the best and easiest recipes I have ever made. The only thing I did differently was what other reviewers have suggested and that is adding one extra can of black beans to the pureed mixture for added texture. I also used less broth, about a cup (chicken instead of veggie broth). I added plain yogurt instead of sour cream to keep this recipe low fat. My husband and daughter loved this and I will be making plenty to freeze and eat for a quicky and yummy meal.

Adding the lime juice makes everything more flavorful.  I really liked it; of course it's important to use a good salsa.  I blended 1 can of black beans and left the other can whole.  I felt the broth was too thin so next time I'll blens 1 1/2 cans of black beans.  A quick and tasty soup worth making again.

so quick and delicious! I used mexican-spiced tomatoes instead of salsa and it was just as good. I made it once with just regular chopped tomatoes and tried to add the spices myself and it wasn't quite as good.

This soup tasted good but I did not like the consistency. It did not look pleasing. It was very easy to put together with ingredients I had on hand. I did use chicken broth instead of veggie broth. Next time I would blend the beans smoother.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. YUM! Can't believe how easy it is to make. I used Pace's hot chunky salsa, so it turned out spicy but still yummy. Next time I will probably use the medium salsa. This one is a definite keeper.

Wow - I think this is almost easier and quicker than making a sandwich! It's a lot healthier and tastier than one too. What a great idea. I didn't have any salsa so I opened a can of Mexican tomatoes with chiles and that was fine for the heat. Didn't have any green onions either but unless you really like onions, it didn't need them. I also left one can of beans whole - glad I did. Awesome - will make this many more times!

I found this recipe to be very easy to make.  You can control the heat by what kind of salsa you add.  I served this with sour cream and deep-fried tortilla strips.  I would make this again.

Easy and delicious!  I left one can of the beans whole and used chicken broth instead. Also added some chopped fresh cilantro.

I made this again as a bean dip (omitting the broth), it's not pretty, but tastes great!

This was a wonderful recipe.  It was extremely simple to make, and tasted delicious.  I didn't have any plain cumin, so I used curry powder instead, and the turnout was great.

This is way too easy! I didn't have any cumin so I used chili powder instead and it turned out great. I added fresh chives and topped it with sour cream and green onions, yum yum!

I loved this soup!  The only thing is that it's way too watery...I put half the amount of broth and it was still a bit too watery for me.
Also, I didn't use premade salsa, but instead used three roma tomatoes, an onion, and three kinds of hot peppers, and seasoned with chili powder!  don't put all of the beans in the blender, for thicker, more "chewable" soup...very very tasty!  it's a keeper!!!
oh...and I DID use a whole lime, too  :D

I found this recipe as written was a little bland, though I used chicken broth as suggested by another reviewer.  I also felt that it was a little too watery.  I ended up adding another whole can of beans, and then adjusting the spices accordingly.  A good basic stock that can be adjusted easily to suit your taste.  Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this on a hot night when no one wanted to cook!  I had run out of cumin, so I substituted oregano, garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added leftover corn and brown rice, and it turned out marvelous!  With tortilla chips broken into it, it was quite enough as a dinner on its own.

Delicious and quick.  We just had this with cornbread muffins.  In the time it took for the cornbread muffins to bake I made the soup, with time to spare.  This will become a standard dish for me.  Thanks so much!

We made this recipe, and no one in the family liked it as a soup.  But... we had fortunately made tacos the night before, and when we pulled out the leftover ingredients, this worked great as a taco topping!  (It would be better with about 1/2 the broth, though.)

This soup was very good. I've given it 5 stars because of the ease of preparation. 4 ingredients, a blender and a few garnishes and you're good to go! I used sour cream, green onions and cheese to top it off.  Next time I'm thinking of using one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans since I like them alot too.

OMG this was a lot better than I thought it would be. We did add some corn & topped with cheese & cilantro, with a dollop of sour cream. You can do so much with this recipe to make it what you want. It is very easy & filling. The only problem is it tasted so good you keep eating it & you're full, but don't want to stop. Very filling. I may try using black beans & soaking from scratch, but using can is so easy. We didn't rinse them because we wanted that little extra flavor. You could also put in a crock pot & have ready for later, as long as you put on a lower temp.

A good & easy basic recipe to start with - but I found for our family it needed jazzing up - so I sauteed diced bell peppers, onions, garlic & a jalapeno in olive oil to mix in .  Added 2 diced chipolte's in adobe sauce to give it some smoky heat, cumin & ciilantro as well. (we like things spicy) My brother liked it so much I had to make a big batch for him to take up north camping this week!   Garnished it with cheese, dice raw onions, fresh clilantro & a dollop of sour cream...yummy!

Very easy to make and tastes incredible.  I made this in a Cuisinart Soup Blender/Cooker.  It was so easy.  Simple ingredients, put them all in, blend them up, cook them and serve.  This was so awesome and I served it with Quesadillas and home made Guacamole.  I think I renewed my marriage for another year.  The wife loved it!  Yes, I am the husband!

Holy beans, Batman! This was so easy and tasted incredible. I sautéed garlic and half a jalapeño pepper in oil then added mixture (1.5 can of beans, salsa, cumin, and chicken broth and onion powder) added the other half of beans whole. So friggin good and easy.

i was really nervous making this today because I cook for seniors, but wanted to try something different. I did add sauteed onion and garlic, because i always do to my "better than boullion" veg broth. I changed the servings to 30ish which took 14 (all i had) cans of black beans. 10 1/2 cups of broth, 2 tbsp cumin, and only 3 cups of medium salsa. I used my hand blender to blend, leaving a creamy, rustic look, then added corn.  My regular taste tester had his thumb up before he even put the spoon down! I'm serving this with cheese quesadillas! Money maker! Thank you for this incredibly easy and adaptable recipe!

This soup tastes awesome! Doesn’t look awesome, but that is the nature of soup. Really good easy and fast dinner. This is a recipe I will be making again and again.

This is delish and so easy to make! 
I do make some additions tho. I add an extra can of beans, 3 cloves of garlic, a half chopped onion,  and half of a jalapeno to the mixture and blend. I top w/ green onions and shredded jack & cheddar cheese.  A very tasty side dish!

Love this recipe. I love black beans but the addition of salsa is amazing. I used Rotel blended until smooth in a blender instead of pre made salsa. My family loved it.

Wow, my family who normally does not eat soup gobbled this is! We paired this with cheese quesadillas and a baguette (to meet everyone’s needs) and it was a hit. Followed everyone and added some whole beans (I would actually keep the two cans of beens for blending and add a whole can of whole beans. I also added garlic after blending. For my tastebuds, I added some sriracha to spice it up.

I just reheated some of this soup from frozen leftovers and it was still GREAT!  I used Hermano Robertos salsa recipe from this site and used a hand blender to thin out the bean chunks. 5 Stars for sure. Awesome soup.

Made with chicken broth.  Liked the zest with medium salsa.  This was very good and will make again, quick and easy on a cold day.  Good base,  would defiintely be good with rice and soft tortillas.

Super easy, super fast.  I added some cayenne to make it a little spicier.  Next time I will blend it a little longer to get a smoother consistency.  This recipe comes out to 1 WW SP.

I loved this and all veggie and good for you. Used low sodium black beans so added and extra t cumin, 1/4 or so red pepper flakes, t ground garlic and dry cilantro. I also let if cook a bit longer to meld flavors and sit with a glass of wine. Sorry I did not make it as is but felt it would be too bland for my family. We did love the flavoring. Lots of green onion on top is delicious!!!

Fabulous! Started with 4 slices of bacon. Sautéed 1 onion in the bacon grease & 1T butter. Once onions are caramelized, add1T fresh garlic & 1/2 jalapeno. Once all veggies are fully cooked, add 4 tsp cumin. Add the pureed 1.5 cans beans & 2 1/2 C chicken stock 1/2 cup at a time. Used 3 cans beans total, 1.5 cans pureed, 1.5 cans left whole. Add 1-2 Tbs sherry. Add diced chicken & 2 bayleaves, simmered 2 hours. Added another 3/4 chicken stock at the very end to make the consistency more like a thick soup and not chili. Toped with bacon, lime, scallions, cilantro, and cheese. Amazing!

Turned out great! You have to let it sit a little while or the salsa taste is overwhelming but after that, very good and simple recipe. I made it around lunch time and served for dinner.

This recipe was great, although we did prepare dried beans for it rather than using canned beans, and added a diced onion we sauteed before adding the other ingredients.

For those of you who are vegan or dairy-free, I would definitely try and substitute the sour cream rather than just leaving it out. It completes the soup, in my opinion.

Nice soup but I wasnt a big fan of the consistency. It seemed a bit on the runny side and not nice and thick like I expected. Maybe use 2 20oz cans of beans instead of 15 and half a cup of broth and it might make it better. Flavour was nice though with different measurements could really boom it up a notch

Delicious! I used low sodium chicken broth, puréed with my immersion blender, and let it simmer in a small crockpot all day. We skipped the green onions and topped with fat free sour cream and a sprinkle of cheddar. My guys loved it too! Easy enough to make before you leave for work.

Didn't have canned salsa;  I chopped tomatoes/pepper/onion, added one garlic clove, and sprinkled dried cilantro.  Used chicken broth instead of veg broth.  Used plain yogurt for the dollop of sour cream.  Very good and quick.  A keeper.

Flavor was good but messed up and used 2 cans of broth with 2 cans of beans and it was way too thin.  Would need at least 3 cans of beans with that volume of liquid.

I made this soup for the first time last night, and my hubby and I liked it. I gave my mom the recipe, and she liked it too (but she added some crushed red pepper to give it a little bit of a kick). This is so easy peasy to make anyone could do it!

This was very good. And a easy recipe. I don't mind the flavor of black beans but hate the texture. This being blended from the get go was good. And tasted great! I  used chicken broth instead of vegetable, used 2.5 tsp. of cumin, 1/4 tsp garlic, and added ~2 Tablespoons of canned chopped green chilis. I made meatballs and added to soup before simmering. Topped with sour cream meant to put cheddar but it didn't need it. It was too spicy for our taste, so I will only use 2 tsp. of cumin and skip the chilis next time.  And there will be a next time!

I love this soup. It's quick, dead easy to make and everyone loves it. People that claim not to love beans don't notice a bean taste and my severe meat-loving friends don't complain about the absence of meat! I serve it with chips from corn tortillas (bake tortilla in pan, cut in pieces) and avocado salsa. Adding sherry as recommended in other reviews certainly makes this soup even better! The alcohol evaporates, just make sure to let the soup boil for several minutes.

The only thing that I had to was add a few more seasonings: 1/2 tsp of turmeric, half a tsp of  Oregano, half a tsp of garlic,  salt and pepper. ( If you want a little spice and just a tsp of cayenne pepper or as much as you want). Instead of green onion I added baby three baby spinach.

I  used chicken broth as we didn't have vegetable stock on hand.  I also added 2 tsp lime juice, dried cilantro and some garlic.  I omitted cumin because we ran out. I also blended some sour cream and used 1 can of beans whole after immersion blender.  Topped bowls with sliced avocado.  Very delicious!!

I used several of the suggestions in reviews to add to and revise this recipe. I sauteed a chopped onion until translucent in oil in a pan, added about 6 minced garlic cloves, and then added 2 tsp. ground cumin, 1/2 tsp. ground coriander, and 1 tsp. dried cilantro, and heated it all until the spices were fragrant. I then added the salsa, chicken broth (not vegetable), and the beans, brought the whole thing to a boil, covered, and simmered it about 10 minutes. Using an immersion blender I pureed the soup until mostly smooth, then added 1 can of corn, drained, and warmed it all up again. Served the soup with sour cream but omitted the green onions.

This soup is SIMPLE and DELICIOUS!  My wife made this for me in the Pureed Food phase of my post weight loss surgery diet.  She used her Vitamix to puree and didn't add the whole beans as I was not allowed to chew.  This will be a go to simple dinner soup from now on!!!

This soup is perfect for a quick, easy, and delicious lunch. I used a tri-bean blend instead of just black beans, which gave the flavor a little bit of diversity, and I think I will change the salsa I use next time. All I had on hand was a mild blend, but I think a medium blend would make it more robust. Over all, I am impressed with how delicious this simple recipe is.

It was pretty good. I followed the directions, and the soup seemed to have a little too much liquid, so next time I'll add less broth and see how that turns out.

The sour cream really adds to the dish, so don't skip it.

I used low sodium chicken broth and it came out great and crumbled 4 pieces of bacon into the soup before serving for added taste. The meat can be omitted and it is still good though. Great soup with few ingredients!

This is super easy and very tasty.  It was a little thin, though.  Next time, I'll try using 3 cans of beans instead of 2.

Yummy!  I used chicken stock and I added pan fried onions and garlic and a good medium salsa.  It was tasty.  the sour cream topping makes big difference to the taste in a good way.

This was really delicious and very easy. I used the ingredients exactly as specified. But instead of blending, I used a potato masher while cooking to reduce/smooth to my preferred consistency.

It was quick & easy. However, 6 out of 8 didn't enjoy it. Won't be making it again as a soup. May try to use it as a dip as another reviewer suggested.

Love it. Because it was quick but I forgot to save some beans from getting puréed as I prefer a chunky soup. I put additional sausa, avocados, Greek yogurt for the sour cream and some tortilla chips.

I love this recipe b/c it's so simple. I switched out the vegetable broth for chicken broth (from a carton, not a can). I also used Paul Newman's mango salsa b/c it gives the soup a nice, sweet flavor without overpowering it. Rinse the beans before you blend them and serve w/ cornbread.

I read the recipe and read the reviews.  The result is using the published recipe as a guide. What I did based on my reading is the following: 

1) Sauteed 1/3 cup chopped onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/3 minced jalapeno pepper in 2 tsp olive oil
2) Added 1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth and 1 can Rotel Mexican Style tomatoes (with lime and cilantro) in place of salsa

Let mixture simmer for 5 minutes.

3) Added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to broth

4) Rinsed and drained 1 1/2 cans black beans and added to broth/tomatoes; reserve 1/2 can beans undrained

5)  Mix in beans and used immersion blender to break up beans

6) Added 1/2 can whole black beans

7) Let mixture simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes.

8) Added 1/4 tsp sea salt 

9) Just prior to serving, add 1 T chopped cilantro

This came out very tasty and spicy.  If you don't like spicy, omit the jalapeno.   It was very easy as well.

I made it as is and it was pretty good. I had to make some changes the second time, though, to suit my need for texture! My changes were to leave some of the beans intact rather than puree them, add shredded chicken breast that I'd sauteed in Adobo Seasoning, add cilantro, and use chicken broth rather than vegetable broth. I also added Frito's to the garnish options!

This is really easy and tasty.  This is great when you are in the mood for a hearty, but non-meat meal.  In addition to the ingredients in the recipe, I add some garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste.

I love this recipe, because it's quick easy and comforting on those nights you don't feel like cooking.  We usually make frozen firecrackers or taquitos to go with it.  I use whatever broth I have on hand and I toss the sour cream in with all the other ingredients and use an immersion blender to make it smooth.  Top with Asiago cheese and green onion.  Yum!

This was fantastic considering how easy it was to make.  The only thing is, it is kind of bland if you don't add any spices.  I added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/8 tsp black pepper.  I also used chicken broth.  I blended everything in the food processor and added 1 bay leaf to the pot before heating it on the stove.  Just before serving we topped our soup with fresh lime juice, sour cream and fresh cilantro.

I'm giving this recipe 5 starts because its simplicity is unprecedented! And it tasted great! I also added some oregano and chili flakes for some more flavour, also I used greek style sour cream for extra protein. Did not disappoint :)

This is great as is plus it's really easy to modify. The only change I made initially was to use no salt chicken stock instead of vegetable broth. The next time around I added 1 additional can of black beans which I reserved until I pureed everything else (I added a bit more stock, salsa & cumin to compensate for the additional volume). The third time around I added some diced ham and the last time some diced chicken plus I used a fresh, refrigerated salsa. Simple as can be to make and turns out fantastic each time.

This soup is amazing! I thought it would be boring and bland but I couldn't get enough. Used Chicken broth instead of vegetable. I tasted it after adding the green onions but before the sour cream and loved it so much I skipped the sour cream altogether.

This is a fast and filling soup!  I made a few alterations:  added extra beans and chicken broth--we are a family of 5 and 4 servings just won't cut it around here.  I sauteed one finely diced onion and 3 large cloves of garlic and added it to the beans and salsa.  We like a bit of heat (even the 6 year old) so we used hot salsa.  In addition to the cumin I added 1 TBSP of chili powder, 1 TSP of Hershey's cocoa, and a teaspoon of my secret weapon--pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  I always keep a jar of this in my fridge--it gives a real jolt of flavor to anything Mexican that you make.  Just open the can, run the whole thing through the blender, put it in a small jar and stash in your fridge.  We sliced up 1 pound of chorizo sausage to make it substantial enough for a main course.  Yummo!  We served it topped with broken tortilla chips, a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Rave reviews all around!

I made this for the second time and doubled the ingredients but used 2 cans black beans, one can chili beans and mashed one can of white beans.  Used beef broth, a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes,  several shakes of Franks Hot Sauce, a teaspoon of roasted minced garlic and one teasp onion powder as I didn't have green onions for garnish.  I tripled the cumin and included 1 1/2 T of lime juice.  Garnished with shredded cheddar and reduced fat sour cream.  Served hot biscuits and a salad with it.  This was so amazing I still didn't have much left over!  In my last review I said I'd triple the recipe, but after several months, that seemed a bit much.  It isn't.  Next time I will!  



4/8/15  Easy, fast and flavorful.  I used low sodium beans and low sodium chicken broth.  I knew 2 cans of beans would not be enough, but I didn't have a third.  Blended drained dark red kidney beans with one of the cans of black beans.  Then added the other can of whole black beans to the pot.  The cumin added to the flavor.  It needed bit more chicken broth, but my husband who eats almost anything but rarely comments on it, said he'd like to have this again soon.  When the beans go on sale I will stock up and triple this recipe so I can have enough left to put in the freezer.

I made this recipe as a quick addition to a lite supper. The only thing I added was hot sauce. Super easy and very tasty!

I made this soup for my family, but I tweaked the recipe just a bit, I added one Serrano Chili chopped fine, and one Jalapeno Chili chopped fine(if you don't want the heat remove the seeds and white membrane) I also added half a cup of frozen corn, and a splash of lime. I served it with a few crushed corn chips on top and grated sharp cheese, along with a dollop of sour cream. My family loved it.

What a great basic recipe.  I read through a few reviews and tried the cooked shredded chicken with this as I prefer a little more protein.  Also used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and held out a 1/3 c. of the black beans until after blending (used immersion blender) to add some texture.   Also added some additional spice - extra cumin (1 tsp ea.), cilantro, chipotle chile powder, smoked paprika and about 1 tsp cocoa powder and a little more unblended salsa.  This was so delicious and will now be a "go-to" recipe.  Thank you.

What an easy weekday dinner!!  A real home run!!  Absolutely delicious. Don't make it in the food processor, though, because the broth leaked out all over the place!! After reading some of the reviews, I added more cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne and fresh lime juice, and the flavors really popped.  Next time I will simply put the ingredients in the pot first and then use my immersion blender.  What could be easier?!  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you AllRecipes!!

This soup was amazing! I took the advice of one of the reviews and added fresh lime juice,   chopped garlic and fresh chopped cilantro. I added crispy fried polenta rounds to the bowl and scooped the soup over top.  We rounded out the meal with sour dough toasted cheese sandwiches. Fabulous!

If you have a Vitamix blender you can make this in about 5 min and it will be piping hot from the blender.  I like to garnish with jalapeños and green peppers.

I first saw this recipe in Lindsey Nixon's "The Happy Herbivore" and have made this hundreds of times!  Everytime I bring it to a pot luck or dinner, people want the recipe - it's wonderful.  I use more black beans and homemade vegetable broth to salsa ratio than called for and I add chili powder and more cumin.  So glad to see this recipe here too!!

This is a great Soup recipe! Tasty and SO easy. I used organic beans, vegetable broth and salsa. I made mine with a 1/4 tsp turmeric and a dash of cayenne pepper. I just threw all ingredients into my Vitamix blender so in just a few minutes I poured out hot soup. I used a dollop of greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. Didn't have any green onion, but I think that it will be good for next time. SOOoo yummy! I'll be making this again for sure!

Easy and usually have everything on hand. Tastes like black bean soup with almost no effort. I also leave about half a can of black beans whole so I can have some in it.

Excellent as is, tho a little mild in taste (which may be what they were going for).  Next time I'll add a can of corn and either more cumin, or some taco seasoning.  Overall, a great recipe and open to many tasty variations!

Excellent and very easy!  I followed the recipe but added 1/2 cup of corn (not pureed) and a clove of crushed garlic.  I did not have veg. broth on hand so I used chicken broth low sodium.  I kept a 1/3 of the beans whole as others recommended.  Lastly, instead of topping my soup with the green onions, I cooked them into the soup mix.  YUMMY!!!  I may add a 1/4 cup of rice to this the next time.  This is a new keeper and one that will be used often!!!  Thanks!

This is delicious!  Even my husband, who isn't a big soup guy, loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll try some of the other reviewers' variations.  I'll also up the ingredients since this barely fed the three of us.  Edited addition - Doubled recipe but held out only 1 can of whole beans - do 2 next time.  Used 1 1/2 Tbsp. cumin, garlic & onion powder plus sherry.  Wonderful! (See Notes)

I wasn't so sure about this recipe, but I trusted the 4 1/2 stars and added a few extra ingred. We loved it! This is what we added -       1 chopped onion, add to the ingred. to be pureed, top soup with sliced avacados and grated cheddar cheese along with the sour cream and chopped green onions. So easy, so yummy!

I would never have tried this soup if it were not for the reviews. Thanks to all! It was just as delicious as everyone said. I listened to some suggestions and sautéed a chopped onion in the pan first. I only pureed 1/2 the can of black beans. I did not have any salsa, so added a fresh chopped tomato to the puree. I also added a dash of lime juice to the finished broth.

I used homemade black beans instead of the canned ones, and used the liquid from the beans rather than the broth. Topped with a few slices of avocado, sprinkle of cheese, and a teaspoon of sour cream. Came out PERFECT! Thank you so much for this quick and easy to use recipe.

It wasn't amazing or anything but it took me all of 5 minutes and about a dollar and a half to make,so I gave it 4 stars for cheap, easy and healthy. And pretty good with the sour cream and some tortilla chips and cheese. And very little clean-up.

Very tasty and very easy.  I left some beans whole and added in some corn for sweetness.  I almost always have these ingredients on hand, so this will become a go to crunch time dish.

Very good!  We served with a dollop of Greek yogurt, which gave a nice creamy consistency and added additional protein.  Goes nicely with Farmer's Market Quesadilla's also on Allrecipes - they're perfect for dipping!

This is so easy and yummy!  I used seasoned black beans and the second time I made it, I added some cilantro.  Had warm crusty whole grain bread for my side.  Sooooo good!

I really liked this soup! I have made it twice now. The first time I substituted lowfat whipped cottage cheese for the sour cream, and the second time I used nonfat greek yogurt. Both times I added some shredded chicken to the soup (after it came out of the blender, of course). Quick and easy recipe!

Love this recipe! I can make it for vegetarian friends or toss in some chicken for my carnivore husband. I use On the Border salsa and leave about 1/3 of the beans whole.

I've made this twice, using the same salsa each time (Santa Barbara mango and peach salsa)  and I can't believe how simple, and delicious this soup is! I did not bother with the sour cream or green onions. Next time I plan on trying different salsa because why not!

After blending, instead of heating it up, I put it directly in containers to bring to work during the week. Yum!

I made it with homemade salsa which added to the flavor but because the salsa was very spicy and flavorful, 1 cup was too much and very overbearing. Had to add salt because it was bland without the salt. However, it was very easy to make and my boyfriend loved it! Thanks for sharing

Super quick, super easy and very good - we really enjoyed this.  I decided to leave some of the black beans whole to have a bit more of a chunky texture!

I loved this.  It was so easy and flavorful.  The onions weren't mushy but crisp. It reminded me of a dish I grew up with in OK as a kid.  Beans and cornbread.  Since watching my diet and tryingn to be very selective on my choices, I found this to be a wonderful meal to have on hand when I don't eat the same things I fix my family. (like speg, meatloaf, etc) My husband liked it too.  Excellent and I've already bought more ingredients to make more.

This was surprisingly good.  I was nervous about it as I was cooking, but it turned out well and even my pickiest eaters ate it.  I added garlic and onion powder and used cheddar cheese instead of sour cream.  And I used chicken broth since that's what I had on hand.  Quick and easy.

5 stars for quickness of recipe, taste and being healthy! Like others suggested, I added sauteed onion, carrot and celery, and some shredded leftover turkey for more substance. Sliced avocado on top elevates this to REALLY GOOD.  My husband prefers chunky soup, so I did not puree. Delicious, thanks for sharing.

This was delicious. I didn't blend until smooth, because I still wanted some whole beans. I loved it, and so did my non vegetarian husband and kids. Served with quesadillas.

Made this for lunch today and it's a keeper. Like other reviewers I was mindful of the salt content in the veg broth and rinsed the beans before combining. I used my immersion blender and whipped it up in a flash. Not the prettiest soup, but delicious just the same. Next time I may use a chipotle salsa for variety. My gal pal suggested I crumble tortilla chips on top and I think that's a good idea too.

This was surprisingly good for how easy it was to make.  My whole family liked it.  I skipped the blender and used my immersion blender right in the pot as it cooked, so much easier.  Will make it again, especially good for a last minute week night dinner.

This was a great fast dinner soup. Made it basically the way it was written just used chicken broth and added a third can of black beans after blending the first two. I can see so many ways to change it like adding diced chicken, turkey or diced ham.  I think it could make a great dip buy using less liquid and adding chedder cheese.  Thanks for making it so simple and good.

Wonderful recipe!!  However, I omitted the vegetable broth as I like a thicker, heartier soup. We also topped ours with shredded cheese along with the onion.

Super easy and really, really good!  It was a little thick, so I ended up adding a couple of more splashes of stock while cooking.  Served over some white rice with a little hot sauce - excellent!

This soup is fabulous!  So insanely easy, and I'm someone who rarely cooks so you know it truly has to be easy.  Every other weekend I make a batch, then have it for lunch several days that week.  So easy, so filling, and good for you.

I like to blend half of the beans and keep the other half whole - nice texture.  I also rinse the beans and use unsalted/low sodium veggie stock to cut the sodium.

My family loves this soup! And I love it because it is so fast and easy!
I did change some things though. Instead of broth I used water, I added 1 more teaspoon of cumin and added a large handful of cilantro and blended in blender. Also, instead of sour cream I used plain yogurt. Then sprinkled more cilantro on top of the yogurt.  
Love, Love, Love this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Made it exactly according to the directions (well, I forgot to add the green onions before eating it, whoops!) and it was amazing.  And easy.  This is going in our regular rotation.  Served with a side of mexican rice.

This is my go-to black bean soup now. Thank you! I make my black beans from dried in 1 hour in a pressure cooker with some onion and garlic. I use Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor instead of veggie broth. I've experimented with different kinds of salsa and I like Costco salsa the best in it. Sometimes I throw in a can of Embasa salsa verde if I want a little more heat.

My family is very picky and this soup was a hit! I made the soup vegan and substituted the sour cream with cheddar veggie shreds. It went perfectly with the roasted veggie foccacia.

I need to watch my salt so I altered it with no salt black beans, added the juice from the black beans and added the remainder fluid with low salt chicken broth.  I added the lime juice, cilantro and added extra cumin.  With the sour cream and green onions on top I added some salsa  fresca for a pretty look.  Absolutely delicious recipe, thanks!!

Great soup and easy to make. I made this using Chicken broth instead of Vegetable and put a large dash of Creole seasoning. This turned out really good. Will make again.

This soup is so quick and easy! Loved it! I did make a few minor changes. I used an electric food processor to blend one can of the black beans and I left the other can whole. I also added 3 strips cooked and crumbled bacon. The bacon added a nice smoky taste.

Very quick and easy, and best of all...tasty! Followed others' advice and tripled the cumin, added garlic, and left out a cup of beans to add when I heated it on the stove. Will definitely be making this again!

This was excellent - I made it in a snap and was very impressed with the flavor!  It is filling, satisfying and healthy all at once.  After making it and bringing to work for lunch, I shared the recipe with 3 others who have since shared it with their friends and family. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW! This recipe never fails to be satisfying and filling. I would definitely follow the advise of the other reviewers and add a can of corn and an additional can of beans at the end for more texture. Cheddar cheese is a must as well. YUM!

Excellent!! I followed some of the other reviewers advice.  I put aside one can of beans to add whole, and I sauteed an onion and 4 cloves of garlic prior to adding the other ingredients.  I also added a splash of Sherry.  My husband said "you can make this anytime"!

AMAZING!!!!

I'm a terrible cook and even I couldn't mess this one up.   I will have to admit that I did make some revisions, as per the suggestions by other users

- I upped the cumin to 3 teaspoons
- Added cilantro
- squeezed in lime
- reserved half a can of black beans to add to the end to make it chunkier

I never know if I should rate a recipe a 5 if I altered it, but I didn't want to rate it less because I did either

A delicious and easy Black Bean & Salsa Soup recipe that I truly enjoyed!  I also made a few changes.  I double the recipe and left 1 can of black beans whole (I also used low sodium black beans).  I used 2 cups Pico de Gallo (only blended 1 cup) verses the salsa.  I added and blended 1 avocado, 1/4 cup cilantro, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 small additional onion and 2 extra jalapenos (I like it spicy).  In addition, instead of cumin I added 1 packet low sodium taco seasoning and 1 packet Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta seasoning.  The seasoning packets gave the soup a bit more zip which I enjoyed.  I used roughly 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth.  I topped the soup with a few tortilla chips, Pico de Gallo, avocado, green onions and sour cream.  Yummy!!

Great recipe!  Couldn't have been easier.  Sprinkled a little shredded cheddar cheese mix on the top after pouring it into the bowl.  Can't believe you can have a homemade soup that tastes so good and is made in such a short amount of time.

Good, but not great. I followed some of the recommendations to add more cumin, and I boiled my own black beans instead of using canned.

Fast, easy, tasty and healthy!  Tripled the cumin, added a little hot sauce and 1/4 c. lemon juice.  Froze it in 1 cup portions--a fast, easy lunch.

I added a small bunch of cilantro to the soup.  This was really easy to make even when making the beans from scratch, which I did.  I didn't think the sour cream would be necessary but it really add to the flavor of the soup so don't skip out on it!

This was pretty good. I used store bought salsa, but I think it would have been better if I had made fresh salsa. Next time I will use dried beans instead of canned.

This was okay.  I enjoyed it for a quick meal after a long work shift since it was easy to make.  Not something that I would serve to guest.

Holy cow this is good! My boyfriend can't get enough of it! This will be in regular rotation for sure. I took the advice of commenters and rinsed the beans to reduce the salt, kept one can of beans whole, added frozen corn, and topped with cheese, as well as the sour cream and green onions! I served it with tortilla chips :D

Oh my goodness this was good!!!!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly except before adding the blended mixture I sauteed red,green,and yellow pepper with onion and fresh minced garlic in some olive oil. Then I added the blended mix,heated through. Put it in my bowl and topped with a dollop of sour cream, some monteray jack cheese and a few crushed tortilla chips. Absolutely DELICIOUS, EASY and relatively Healthy. Will deff. be a staple in my diet!!!!

Excellent dish. Instead of blending together as a first step, I did it as the last. Perhaps this makes it a bit faster/easier since the beans are well cooked at that point.

I wanted to like this one, but we just didn't enjoy it.  Neither of us liked the texture of the soup (we must not like how black beans puree) and we weren't too keen on the combo of flavors either.  I halved it, as I often do, so we wouldn't have leftovers.   I love how easy it is, but it just wasn't working for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy. Easy.  This takes no time to make and is good.  I used chicken broth instead of veg. broth, added some dashes of chipotle hot sauce for flavor, and sprinkled some dried cilantro.  I didn't bother with the blender because I have one of those emulsion blenders (like for smoothies) that blends right in the pot and it worked perfectly.  Added cheese to the topping list... and delish!  Will need to come back to this recipe on those days when I neglect to plan dinner ahead and need it in a pinch. UPDATE: I added about a tablespoon of cream cheese to make it slightly thicker and a tiny bit creamy.

I liked this recipe because it was so easy and the soup was tasty. I used a medium salsa that has a bit of a smokey flavor to it. I wish other reviewers included what kinds they have tried because there are so many out there! Next time I will experiment with a different salsa, just to see what it's like.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I left one can of beans whole. I also added some cayenne because I like spice.  I am the only one of my family who will eat black beans, but I'd make this again because it takes no time at all.

This is a quick, easy and delicious black bean soup recipe.  It is not my favourite black bean soup recipe (which takes a couple of hours to cook)- but it is a great, quick recipe- and one worth keeping for lunches ;)

Super simple and tastey. I reserved some beans to keep whole, doubled the cumin (my stock was kind of bland), skipped the sour cream and served with brown rice.

I was looking for super easy and mediocre in taste - this was super easy and AWESOME. I used Chicken Broth instead of Veggie, and because my family and I are a bunch of pigs and 4 servings is like 1 1/2 servings to us, I blended 1 1/2 cans, added 1/2 can no fat refried black beans, and added the other half can of whole beans. We also threw in a few tortilla chips, too. Even my 5 year old loved it.

Follow the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 teaspoon each of onion power and garlic powder, as well as two hearty splashes of Sherry wine (not cooking Sherry, real Sherry). Incredible.

Very tasty and so easy and quick to make.  I read the reviews and also reserved about 1/2 cup of beans and added them after blending.  I will definitely make this one again.

Amazing.  Added some red pepper flakes and omitted soure cream.  Toasted a whole wheat tortilla and used it like croutons.

Loved this recipe!  I halved it the first time and will never do that again.  This is a recipe that is most definitely worthy of leftovers.  Second time I made this I was at my mother-in-laws who didn't have cumin and only had mild salsa, so I fiddled around with some other spices.  It turned out alright, but not as good as the first time.  If you like a bit of a kick, make sure to have at least medium salsa on hand!

This soup is too yummy! I did add a few things just for some extra flavor.  2 links of Spicey Turkey Sausage casings removed, crumbled and sauteed and about 1/2 can of corn with the red and green chilies. I took the advice of others and left about a cup of beans out to add later for better texture, and I used Low Sodium Chicken Stock.  My boyfriend and I ate it all...No leftovers!

This was really good! I did add some cream, cilantro, fresh chopped jalapeno, cayenne pepper, and fresh squeezed lime to this. Glad I made a double batch b/c  between 4 adults this was a big hit and went quick!

Incredible!  So easy and so very tasty!  I didn't have any vegetable broth, so I used chicken bouillion.  As others suggested, I left some beans whole also some salsa.  Also added some garlic powder.  May not be pretty, but certainly delightful!!

I made this with a can of Ro-tel tomatoes and chicken broth.  Because I wanted to leave one can of the beans whole, my pureed portion was quite thin, so I added more black beans to thicken it up.  I did add 2 T. sherry which added an interesting flavor.  Not a pretty soup, so be sure to garnish it up!  I served this with a mexican pizza, which was a nice compliment to this soup.

I can't believe I'm rating this 5 stars, but it was really good!  It's SO simple, and it honestly looks terrible, but it tastes great.  I added another 1/2 t. of cumin and a dash of garlic salt.

Great soup and so easy! I did what others did and added some whole black beans and corn and used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, and it turned out amazing. Even my picky 6yo brother loved it! I will definitely make this again.

This is an amazingly easy and fun soup to make.  I use it for our soup lunch at the college and usually make 20 quarts.  It is so easy to cook black beans that I start from scratch the night before.  The students love this soup!

This soup is awesome!! Going off of other reviews i "doctored it up" a little by adding sauteed onions and garlic, corn, garlic salt, a splash of lemon juice and sherry, and increasing the cumin.  I also reserved 1/2 C. of black beans and 1/2 C. of corn to add whole after blending the rest together.  Will definitely make again! :)

this was tasty and easy despite my modifications to the recipe based on what i had on hand. i mixed 1 can of trader joes cuban black beans plus 1 can of regular black beans (food processed) with 1.5 cups of beef broth and 1 can of kroger brand italian seasoned diced tomatoes and sprinkled with some paul prodhomme's magic no salt seasoning. let it simmer for 5 minutes, and then served topped with crushed tortilla chips and a dollop of homemade guacamole. very good, though next time i would go with salsa over diced tomatoes.

This was not only delicious but also sinfully easy to make.  I made it as instructed for dinner for myself and my husband.  I had a hard time leaving my husband's portion untouched!  My husband liked it well enough he raided the fridge later to see if I had secretly stashed some away.    The best part is how easy it is to make.  I used my food processor the first time I made the soup, then my blender the second time.  It was great both ways, but a little less messy in the blender.  I used fresh salsa from the grocery deli though I don't think canned would make too much of a difference.  The cumin is so necessary and adds so much to this dish, I would never remove it.  Like other reviewers I reserved some whole beans to add in after blending.  Deeeeelish.

This is by far my favorite go-to easy soup recipe. I've made it for a few pot lucks and soup lunches at work, and it always gets GREAT reviews. I blend all of it, since I like it smooth, and add a dollop of sour cream and a few crushed tortilla chips. With Lent coming up, I've decided to give up meat, and this will be a staple in my meals!

I sauteed a little bit of onion, garlic and the cumin in a tsp of oil and added it to the beans, salsa and broth. (I didn't have veggie broth on hand so I used chicken broth.)  This quick recipe is a winner for something healthy!

What a great recipe.  We had this for lunch with a salad.  The only thing that I put in for my taste was Hot salsa.  Everything else I left the same.  I would for sure next time keep some of the beans a side and not blend them about a half a can.  I will also be trying to make this with dry beans also.

I changed/added a few things that sounded good to me, and loved how it turned out:  I used dried beans that I cooked with a few cloves of garlic and a bay leaf, and replaced the vegetable broth with the cooking liquid from the beans;  I also sauteed onion and garlic; I pureed 1/2 of the soup & then added some frozen corn, a handful of cilantro and a little lime juice.  I really liked those additions.  Topped with lite sour cream, cheese & a couple corn chips.  I really enjoyed this soup and will make it often.

I've made this a few times now. It's very good, and only takes seconds to prepare. I always shred a little cheese on top when it's done.

So easy and so good! I wanted to have enough for 6 servings, so I added another can of beans (I just had pinto on hand), with a half a teaspoon more cumin and some red pepper flakes. I also did leave about 1/2 - 1/3 of the black beans whole as others suggested, which I thought added a lot to the texture. Great recipe!

I really liked it. I used dried soaked beans, so I didn't  need the whole amount of broth- instead I used a spoon of boullion concentrate. I also cooked the beans with onion and a couple cloves of garlic, which I blended with the beans. It turned out really well, and it is a keeper!!

I have never had anything so delicious that took a blink of an eye to make! I took the other reviewers suggestions and saved one cup of beans to add whole, I added 3 teaspoons lime juice, tripled the cumin, added a teaspoon of roasted garlic, a handful of freshly chopped cilantro and 1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper. I also added sauteed red onion and sauteed the green onion as well and added it to the soup.   This would be worth making if it to ten times as long to make. Try it, you will not be disappointed!

This was yummy and very easy. I added garlic, lime juice and some whole beans as other reviewers sugested and liked the addition. I used home cooked beans rather than canned and had to add some salt too. GOOD!

I can't believe that something so easy to prepare could taste this good.  I made no modifications except topped with cheddar instead of sour cream.  This is one meal there is no guilt over eating; healthy and delicious!  My picky 5 & 2 year-olds even ate it.

I really was not expecting this to be impressive, but I thought it was great!  I added about some sherry to it like another person suggested, but that's the only modification I made.  And a dollop of sour cream really seals the deal!  I'll make this again and again.

GREAT base for black bean soup. Confession - i mostly made this because i wanted to use my new immersion blender - - and it was FANTASTIC! Added another can of black beans and a can of diced tomatoes too. And spiced it up more - i honestly don't think i've ever made anything with one spice! Served with shredded cheese and green onions on top (and a dab of fat free sour cream for me!) YUM!

I made this soup for my husband when he had a cold, but was tired of chicken soup. I mainly chose it because it was getting late, and it didn't look like this would take very long. I did a couple of things differently: I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of salsa. I also added about 2 tablespoons of jalapeño slices and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne-based seasoning. (My husband wanted it spicy.) It was very good, and I will most definitely be making this again, even when we aren't sick!

I made this a chunky soup by not blending all of the beans and salsa, and reducing the broth a bit.

I thought this was delicious! I took others' advice and sauteed garlic and onions together before adding the black bean mixture and then added one extra can of black beans that I didn't puree. We like things spicy so I also added some cayenne pepper and hot sauce.

So, so, so good! To reduce the sodium, buy reduced sodium black beans and rinse well. I added corn. I would leave some beans out of the food processor for texture.

Fast & Easy recipe! I added onion & garlic and also threw in some smoked sausage.  I thought the consistency was a little thin so next time I will add a little flour before throwing it in the pot to heat it up.

This soup was excellent.  I was looking for a quick soup to make for lunch with ingredients that I had on hand.  I did add a few things to the recipe.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic minced, 1 onion chopped, about half a green pepper and threw in some frozen corn.  With a dollop of sour cream on top and some corn chips broken up and thrown over this was an EXCELLENT lunch that from start to finish took only about 20min!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent soup.  So easy and good.  I think the end quality will really vary though based on the ingredients you put in.  If you don't already like the salsa, you're not going to like the soup!  Oh, I left out the green onion, not a big enough fan to bother with it.

I made this from memory and it turned out great.  I sauted a small red onion, used 1 can of chicken broth, one can of black beans and 3/4 of a table spoon of toasted fresh ground cumin seed and a small handful of cilantro, I didn't remember the green onion.  Topped it with sour cream.  It was DELISH.  My hubby and I finished the pot.  THANKS a bunch.  This will be great throughout the winter as I always have the ingred at hand. Served it with pan toasted corn tortillas

We found this soup very bland.  I added the extra can of whole black beans, but it definitely needs the garlic and salt that others mentioned.

Five stars for simplicity and taste. This was so easy, quick, and yet very tasty. I also used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand and I did leave some of the beans whole. I served this with some homemade wheat tortillas. I'll keep this recipe.

Excellent for a really quick recipe; only took 30 minutes start-to-finish, and likely you already have everything you need in your pantry. I added 1-2 cloves garlic and 1/2 of a fresh lime, squeezed. Instead of dirtying a blender to puree the soup, I used my immersion blender - it's a MUST-HAVE in your kitchen utensils, especially if you like a lot of soups.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I've had black bean soup one other time in my life, at Panera Bread, and it was awful.  This recipe needed no changes whatsoever.  I highly recommend this recipe for both vegetarians and meat eaters.

Wow - really quick and delicious!  I only blended half of the black beans, because I like a little more texture in soup; I also ended up adding half a can of refried beans because I tend to like thicker soup than this made - I thought it was a bit thin.  I used chicken stock because it's what I had on hand, and added a little lemon juice and cilantro at the end to give it a little more kick.

A quick, delicious soup. The only soup I don't chill overnight before serving. I use chicken instead of vegetable broth. When pureeing the ingredients, I hold 1/2 can of beans aside and add them to the soup whole. Gives it a nice texture.

Easy, Simple, Delicious!  What more could you want?  This would be perfect to serve as a first course when entertaining because it is quick and easy to throw together but it has a complex taste that would easily fool guests in to thinking it was much more work than it actually was.  Excellent!  By the way, it is also a very filling soup so it can easily be a meal in itself.

This soup is inexpensive to put together, but tastes so great! I hunted around until I found no-salt-added black beans, which cut down on the sodium a LOT. Very easy to dress up with some sour cream or cheese or lime. Tasty!

I've made this soup 3x so far and absolutely love it. My family loved it as well (including my extended family). I even made a batch to freeze in individual portions to reheat when I've had a long day at work and don't feel like cooking. I add rice to it for more texture. Delish!

I followed others and started by sauteing onions and garlic.  I also added carrots.  After 10 minutes, I added two cups of stock (I used chicken because it was on hand), brought it to a boil, and simmered it covered about 15 mins to soften the carrots.  Then I added 3 cans of beans, salsa, cumin and hot sauce and pureed it all in the pot using my handheld.  Delicious!

It's so easy and yummy. Even better if you add serranos or jalepenos, onion and garlic and saute before adding the rest of the ingredients. Really good with half a lime squeezed in at the end too.

This is without a doubt a keeper. It tastes great, it's super easy, and it's very forgiving - you can add a little of this, or a little of that to kick it up or notch - or make it exactly as is and it's still fantastic.

This was WONDERFUL on a cold rainy day. I always use organic low sodium black beans in my cooking.  Along with a vegetarian "chicken" bouillon for the stock and store bought salsa, it was plenty salty and flavorful.  I was able to put this together while my cornbread was cooking and they were both ready at the same time.  Easy, quick, and tasty, can't beat that!  Thank you for posting.

I made a few adjustments, and really enjoyed this healthy soup. Even Daniel enjoyed it with his usual sour cream topping.   Changes:  1 can of black beans  1 can of black eyed peas  1 can of rotel (used lime and cilantro flavored rotel - very good) instead of the salsa  Added spices to liking - red pepper, cumin, black pepper.  Sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil to add extra flavor.   YUM! We ate this with homemade flour tortilla chips. Had 2 big bowls, and some leftover for work lunch. It was just enough for us, and didn't leave us feeling ill or gassy.

Delicious!  I didn't have two cans of black beans so used 1 can of mixed beans and another one of black beans.  I used a submersion blender to puree it while it was in the crock pot.  I ate it with sour cream and green onions...but added crushed nacho chips to the top of the kids bowls.  My fussy 9 year old son gobbled it up and loved it!

Love this!  Healthy, easy, and vegetarian.  I used some leftover fresh salsa and it was amazing!  Also added sauteed onion, cayenne pepper, chili powder, lime juice, and a little extra cumin as suggested by others.  YUM!!

Thank you for this recipe! Delicious and easy. I wanted to use up most of the salsa & broth so I made a recipe and half. I too kept about 1/3 beans unblended for texture, and added a drained can of Mexicorn. The corn added more nice flavor & texture.

I made this last night because I had a huge batch of black beans I made last week. This was good and simple. I think using homemade beans and high quality salsa made it even better. I topped mine with green onions, sour cream, crumbled tortilla chips, cheese, and chopped cilantro.

This soup was excellent! Like the other reviewers I sauteed and added an onion and about 3-4 cloves of garlic. I also didn't have real chunky salsa so I added a can of tomatoes with chili's. To cut the sodium I added low sodium broth, beans and tomatoes.

so simple and so good! I was skeptical because there were so few ingredients, but am glad i tried this. I added about a teaspoon of taco seasoning and some red pepper flakes to give it a little heat.

Wow! This really is as easy as it sounds!  I made/ate this on my lunch hour after making lunch for my toddler and still had time to spare! I too reserved some of the beans to add whole, upped the cumin as others suggested, added some fresh garlic (from a jar--fast!), fresh cilantro, lime juice and splash of hot pepper sauce (caribbean) and it was really good.  I think to make it great next time I am going to use fresh salsa as all I had on had was the jar type (which I really don't like the flavor of), but it did make it fast and still very VERY good! Oh, and no grn. onions on hand so just ate mine with some sour cream and few chips. Yumm.

This is a great simple super-quick recipe that lends itself to personal taste. I like to blend half of the beans and keep the other half whole. I also love sweet corn and plenty of cayenne or chili pepper added in. I've even added slightly undercooked rice once. Different salsas are fun to try out and experiment with different tastes.

I LOVE this soup!! I can't believe something this easy is THAT good! I made it over the holidays for my vegetarian daughter-in-law and son and it was gone between the two of them! It's my "go to" recipe for my husband, as it's so diabetic friendly! I did try altering it a bit by doing white beans and salsa verde and, while it was good, the original recipe is perfection!

I have been forcing myself to eat more beans because of how healthful they are.  Even so, after making this exactly according to the recipe, I realized it was a bit too beany for me.  (I always prepare recipes exactly as written the first time, because you cannot very well review your own alterations and then rate the recipe.)  Rinsing the beans not only cuts back on the sodium in this recipe, but also improves the appearance, as it lightens up what is already a very dark colored soup.  I would probably add a lot more salsa or other tomato based products if I were to make this again.

Great recipe.  I added a little chili powder, paprika, extra cumin, cayenne, lime juice, and cilantro and doubled the recipe.  I then froze single serving sizes for quick meals, this soup is even better after being frozen!  I will definitely continue to make this soup

I have spent hours trying to make good black bean soup with almost no success.  Now, you have made it so easy and quick.  The soup is excellent.  I substituted ham broth with some meat, and only processed half of the beans, adding the second can as it.  I loved it!

This is a pretty good quick recipe! Love finding shortcut recipes, and this is a great base. I did as another reviewer and kept some beans separate to add in while heating. Also, we use Herdez salsa, so I didn't need the full amount to get max flavor. Will probably add a drop of Scorned Woman next time to get a bit more complexity/smokiness and a bit more heat. Made this in the blender the second time for a nice smoothness with the added whole beans. Thanks for the great recipe!

I took this to the office for a pitch in Mexican Lunch.  Everyone loved it the pot was empty.  I did add sauteed onions and garlic and I didn't have vegetable stock so I used chicken, it was easy and fast.

My two teen daughters helped me make this for a Christmas party.  One emptied and rinsed the beans, another measured out the salsa, and I measured out the veggie broth.  We did 5 cans/cups of each-one at a time in the food processor.  It made a nice big pot of VERY good soup!  I had a vegetarian say it tasted like I have been cooking vegetarian foods all my life!  Even us meat eaters are loving this soup!!!

Good recipe!  I'm not so sure I like how runny it is, but it still has a very good taste.  Will probably lessen the amount of broth next time.

I was starving and in a hurry and this recipe was in the back of my mind.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I improvised--northern beans for black beans, some garlic instead of cumin--and it came out really tasty.  I can't wait to try this with black (and maybe pinto) beans and all the variations the other reviewers have come up with.  This is one of the best vegan dinners I know of, and it takes zero time--fantastic!

I thought this recipes was YUMMY! I also only blended one of the cans. And I tried to reduce the sodium by only add part water and part veg broth.

Easy preparation and great taste!  I sauteed some fresh garlic in the saucepan before adding the bean/salsa/broth mixture.  Also added a bit more cumin and a sprinkle of chili powder.  Will definately be making this again.

LOVED IT!!! My husband and I gobbled up our first serving, and then we had seconds.  I only made a few minor changes.  I increased the yeild amount to six people.  I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers;I sauted 2 finely chopped cloves of garlic in about 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil, and I added lime juice to the individual servings.  I didn't want to take the time to cook any cornbread, but I served it with some Tostito's Hint of Lime corn chips. If you are watching your salt in-take skip the chips, but either way, Yum :0)

Super easy!  A little pepper jack cheese mixed in while simmering gave it just the right amount of kick and added some texture.  I also used low sodium vegetable broth from the "organic" section of the grocery store.

This soup was easy, delicious and filling (and low-calorie)!  I topped mine with chopped jalapeno peppers instead of scallions because that's what i had on-hand and it was delicious.  I also used an emersion blender instead of dirtying my food processor or blender.  Cleanup was a breeze.

So Good!  Used the advice from others and added more cumin, cilantro, sherry, garlic and sauteed chopped onions.  I also added a third can of beans, but left them whole and used chicken broth instead of veggie.  I added chopped chicken and brown rice to make it a whole hearty meal.  Would work out great as a dip if most of the broth is left out.  Will definately make again.

This was fantastic! It was so quick and easy to make. I added a tsp of minced garlic when I was running in through the processor along with some sea salt and milled peppercorns. Made some fresh salsa and tortilla chips to serve on the side. YUM!

We enjoyed this quite a bit.  I love how easy it is!  We topped our soup with a dollop of sour cream and some crushed Fritos.  That really livened it up even more!

This was sooo good!  I didn't have vegetable stock, so I used chicken stock.  Next time I'll make sure to have the veggie on hand for a truly meatless experience.  I used some Tostitos salsa I had in the fridge.  It worked fine, but I think next time I'll use a fresh salsa for even more flavor.  I didn't add the sour cream (not a fan) and the soup was still superb.  No need to add the extra calories!

SO easy and SO delicious. You can alter it however you want, but I tried it as is (sans spices...didn't have any) and I loved it. My roommates asked me to put it into the regular meal rotation. Thanks!!

Make sure you like the salsa you use before making this recipe; the soup will taste just like it. It is insanely easy to make - it took less than 10 minutes start to finish; my husband couldn't believe I made it from scratch!

Incredibly easy and delicious.  I made this for my Soup Swap and its gotten rave reviews.  I agree with reserving a can of beans to add in at the end, unprocessed.  Also added double the cumin, and then also onion powder, garlic powder and chili powder.

Quick and easy and very yummy!  I used a medium salsa and it still had a nice kick to it.  Reserved some of the beans whole and added to the pot when warming. I found this on the thin side (maybe because I didn't puree all the beans), so I took out 4 tbsp of soup and mixed 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch, added back to the pot, and let boil for a minute or so.  Helped to thicken it up nicely.  The sour cream and onions really make this dish.

This recipe was so simple and exactly what I was looking for. I cooked up some spicy chorizo in a frying pan and added that in, too, which complimented the black beans and salsa really well. I've already made two batches and will definitely make it in the future.

This soup was just ok.  I only added a cup of vegetable broth and that was plenty.  The second night I ate the soup it was better but still just 3 stars.  Thanks for the recipe though.

I would give it a 10 if I could!  It is fast, easy, and (best of all) healthy.  I add more cumin, some red pepper flakes, cilantro and lime for more zing, but that is my taste.  I have made this many, many times, and it always gets rave reviews!

This is an awesome recipe for a quick, inexpensive, and filling meal.

I wasn't expecting it to be so thin, so when I make it again this week I'm going to omit some of the vegetable broth and maybe add some more salsa.

I also used salsa verde instead of a chunky salsa, which probably contributed to the thinness.

I really didn't think this would turn out so great! It's so easy, I even used fresh beans I had made the day before. In addition to the cup of salsa, I also dumped in there some chopped onions and cilantro I wanted to use up. To top it off, fresh green onions and a little cheese went great! Next time I'll add a few slices of avocado too!

This recipe is so simple! This is by far the quickest and tastiest recipe I have been able to find for vegetarian black bean soup. It's also extremely low-cost.

This is an awesome soup! I did add a shake or two of Tocasco sauce, juice from about 1/4 lime, and about 1/4 tsp dried cilantro. I left half of the beans whole like other reviewers suggested. It makes an awesome soup and is a great side for a panini sandwich.

This was so simple and good.  I added about 1 Tbsp of cumin, sprinkled cilantro in the soup while it was heating, and will add chopped onions next time.  Don't skip the sour cream - it finishes off the soup wonderfully!

This soup is awesome and so easy.  I like to blend half of the beans and salsa and leave the other half not blended--gives a little chunky to the soup.

This soup is just as good as all of the reviews say. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding just a touch more stock-to thin it a bit.
I topped my soup with a sour cream that I had added a bit of lime juice and chopped cilantro. Great Recipe-It's a keeper for me.

I've got some of this delicious soup cooking in the crock pot as I'm writing this review. I love the way it makes the house smell. The recipe is simple to make and hearty to eat. 

The first time I made it I blended both cans of the beans. While I enjoyed the texture, my husband recommended leaving one can whole the next time.

Now I just blend one can of beans with my immersion blender, then add the salsa and blend, then add the whole beans and spices. The crock pot does all the rest.

We eat it with cheese quesadillas and garnish with onions, sour cream, and cheese.

It's a wonderful recipe.

I thought that this was a pretty good recipe, however I added a bit more cumin, and added cilantro, garlic, and a dash of tabasco to it as well.  I saved a half a cup of beans as per user recommendations, but I think the next time I make this I'll use both cans of beans in the blender, then add another can while its cooking.  The sour cream on top is a must though, so good :)

This soup was AWESOME. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken, added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped onion, and a teaspoon of sour cream before blending.

Wonderful!

Who knew black bean soup could be so easy?  I tried this on a whim, looking for something quick to serve alongside Ronaldo's Beef Carnitas from this site.  I don't prefer it to more traditional black bean soup, but considering how simple it was to make,  it really was delicious.  Will keep it in mind for those last-minute needs.  Thanks, Maryanne!

This recipe is sooooooooo good. It's dishes like these that make me think I can become a vegetarian. a few tips: when you get the beans in the can, make sure they're unseasoned (I tired it with seasoned and unseasoned beans and the unseasoned tastes better). I also added a little shredded cheddar cheese on top. This is a wonderful recipe that I can see myself eating time and time again.

For me, this was not as amazing as most others said.  Very simple and good nutritional value, however, it's hard to get the family to eat something so visually unappealing.  But I know they're black beans, so that's just the way it is.  Probably won't make this again, but thanks!

This recipe was good but not great.  I would recommend cutting the cumin from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 a teaspoon.  I thought the flavor of the cumin was overwhelming, and I like cumin.  I added corn as suggested by other reviews, but next time I will probably leave the corn out.  I also sauted onion and garlic and added it to the soup.  Next time I will leave out the garlic.

This was a great fast recipe. I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable but otherwise followed the recipe. I fried up some flour tortillas I had into strips and topped the soup with the tortillas and shreadded cheddar cheese along with the sour cream. It was a big hit even with my picky family. Will definately make it again......

Even with all of the good reviews, I was skeptical.  I have never had Black Bean soup before, and perhaps that is why.  However, I thought it was really good. I reserved about a cup of beans, used medium salsa, and topped it with ff sour cream, ff cheese, and some green onion.  Fantastic!  My partner made his own dinner at first because he "hates beans," but after trying it, he even licked the bowl.  (Of course, he wants to use it as a dip or a sauce instead of a soup, but he still really liked it!)  Thanks!

Yum!  This is SO delicious and SO easy.  The first time I made this almost exactly the same (except chicken broth instead of veggie) and it was great.  
I did of course decide to do a little tweaking, as follows:
Diced and sauteed some bacon, set aside.
In bacon drippings sauteed 1/4 onion, diced, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 jalapeno (at the last second), diced.
Added all of the above (except the bacon) to the blender with all of the original ingredients (I used 3 cans beans but left one whole), 1 can S&W mexican stewed tomatoes (i swear by these!), ~1/2 cup Pace Hot salsa, and a handful of fresh cilantro.
Then garnish with what any of the others have suggested.  You can add the bacon in as well, though I save it for something else (bacon bits for salad).... I just like the base flavor the bacon gives for the onion/garlic.

OMG!!! This soup was WONDERFUL and so easy!!! Didn't change a thing! It's the perfect thing to make when you need to impress with NO TIME!!! All of my guests forced me to give up the recipe - and were amazed they didn't even need to write it down! We were scraping the pot and I ended up making another batch the next night! Super healthy and packed full of flavor! Thanks for one of my new favorites!

Loved it!  It's quick easy and delicious.  Added garlic and topped with cheese, avocado, onion and sour cream.  Also did a low sodium version using salt free (Eden brand) black beans, low sodium broth and a salt free home made salsa.  Just as yummy.

This was fast and delicious! I didn't have the salsa, so I put a Roma tomatoe in and about 1 heaping (flatware) teaspoon of my own hot sauce (Recipe: Onion & Habanaro pepper, to taste, both chopped very fine.  Add lime juice to almost cover and allow to sit so flavors seep out.) I forgot the cilantro & garlic that another review had suggusted, but will add that next time! I did save some whole beans to through into the pot which added some "meat" to the soup!  We had a gourmet soup in 10 minutes flat!  Great recipe!!  I love it and will definately use it again!

Made this to take for work one week when I was tired of the same old same old. I was worried I might get hungry quickly as I am used to having a protein and vegetable along with nuts for lunch. No problems! I was satisfied until my snack time 3 1/2 hours later. I topped mine with cilantro, scallions, lime juice, and avocado chunks (my MUFA). I followed everything but added about an ounce of chopped ham steak and a little cayenne. As suggested I left one can of beans whole. Already called mom with this one. Definately a keeper!

This was good simple and easy to make I will keep this one for lazy days! I thought it needed some texture to it so I added a can of drained and rinsed whole beans and some corn. I also added some extra salsa not pureed. very good and its healthy.

This is a good quick and easy soup. I'll use the hot salsa next time though for a little extra spice and I don't normally like spicy food. I saved a little of the beans whole like other reviewers suggested to give it a little more substance. I served it with crunchy bread.

Muy Bueno! Since we have kids and elders that can't handle spicy, I blended jalapenos and HOT salsa separately and added to the individual bowls for those who like it spicier. Excellent with quesadillas.

This was so easy!  I must confess though that I thought I had two cans of black beans when I only had one...so I used a can of fat-free refried beans instead.  It worked great.  I did hold out about a cup of the black beans and added some frozen corn.  Great for a mom with two little ones hanging on my pants legs!

This soup was really easy, healthy and delicious!  I used low sodium organic black beans, and I used low sodium broth, so it ended up a bit bland by the time I was finished.  I just added a little salt and it was perfect.  Also added sauteed garlic and onion, and garnished with avocado.  This soup is surprisingly filling - so beware if you plan on serving it with something else.

Absolutely wonderful and could not have been easier. I made a few changes. I sauteed some garlic and minced onion. Then I added an additional can of beans and upped the cilantro to 2 t. Oh, and I like it spicy so I dribbled a touch of Tabasco to give it an extra kick. I got so many compliments on it I almost felt guilty for how easy it was. Thank you for this keeper of a recipe.

I made this the other night and it was absolutely delicious! Like others, I left some of the beans whole; I used medium-spicy Pace salsa and added a few dashes of hot sauce. I also threw in some chopped-up cilantro as well as small amounts of garlic powder, pepper, lime juice, and paprika. I added diced avocado and shredded Monterey jack cheese to the bowls, and served with cheese quesadillas. Very filling AND it reheats well.

This was the easiest recipe to make!! With an active 2 year old at home and a baby on the way, I'm not exactly in the mood to cook.  My husband came home and was delighted to find a new meal creation on the table.  I added homemade tortilla chips on the side.  Dinner was a hit!  I also took another review's advice and kept one cup of whole black beans to add to the pot after pureeing the soup.

I was on a diet where I could pretty much only eat fruits and vegetables for two weeks so this helped me make it through. It's not one of my favorites but my family likes it so that's why I give it 4 stars.

So yummy:) This has become a lunch staple at my house.  Variations/additions I do to make it perfect: 1.5 to 2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp powdered garlic, handfull of thawed frozen corn, shredded carrots & shredded zuccini, & I use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I serve with jiffy corn muffins (I follow box recipe directions but also add a handful of sharp cheddar cheese, & handful of thawed corn & or shredded zuccini & or carrots too).

This recipe is so easy, fast and tastes great.  The first time I made it my husband saw it in the blender and thought yuk.  It does not look pretty in the blender but once heated it looks better and tastes great.  You can alter the hot spicy taste by using your personal choice mild, medium or hot Salsa.  It also tastes just as good reheated.  It is a family regular.

This was a very quick & easy recipe.  I followed the other reviewers advice and kept one can of beans whole and added a bag of frozen corn for a heartier consistancy as a main dish.  I also topped it with some shredded cheese and green onions before serving.

My husband and I loved this soup!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and threw in half of a jalapeno and juice of half a lime.  It was perfect.  We ate it with cheese quesadillas.  My husband told me to put this into the regular rotation of meals.

Wow!  DELICIOUS!  I added garlic and some shallot like others recommended, and left some beans whole.  I also added a handful of frozen corn kernels as it was warming up and served it with sour cream and some crusty bread... Next time I will try to saute the garlic and onion before adding it to the blender to give it a deeper flavor, but all in all, this is a keeper and I will certainly make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly. For ease of prep, this is definitely a '5'. Taste wise, it was quite good, but for it to get a '5', it would have had to have had a little more "oomph' in the taste catagory. May add more ingredients in future. Highly recommended nevertheless.

It doesn't get much better than this.  OR EASIER!  This was such a great time saving recipe that turned out to be extremely delicious.  I added diced avocado to the bottom of my bowl before serving and left some of the beans and salsa un-blended for a chunkier soup.

I added some extra spices and a can of hominy. I really enjoyed it, but think I will leave some whole beans next time for better texture.

Good recipie but I modified it a little. I added some garlic salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Also when it was done I garnished it with parsley. Very tasty on a cold winter night!

So easy!  I will definitely keep all these items in my pantry for an easy, last-minute meal.  I think I will cut the veggie stock a bit, to thicken the soup.  Or let it boil off a bit more.  Great with cheese, sour cream and a few tortilla chips on top.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

So quick and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly for the soup, but garnished with tortilla strips, avacado, cheese, onion and sour cream.  Will make this again.

This is so simple, yet it quickly became a staple weekday dinner at our house. I bake a batch of cornbread muffins from prepared mix (which also takes 20 min) and dinner is done in less than 30 min.

Excellent recipe that is very flexible.  I use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and have learned that medium salsa is a must, (the mild salsa makes it rather bland.) I blend all the beans but a cup, just for added texture. I've never missed the green onion, however, the cumin is a must.

DELICIOUS!  I used 1 can italian style stewed tomatoes and about 1/2 c. water instead of the broth.  Pulsed it in the blender to the consistency I liked.  I reserved 1/2 can of the black beans to add while heating, next time I might add more than that.  I also used 1 1/2 t. of cumin as others suggested.  SOOOOOO easy and YUMMY.  Perfect for cold days/nights.  Even my VERY VERY picky husband ate it!!  And THAT says a lot!

Fantastic!  Tastes great served with bread for dipping.  I made a meal with it by serving with Chicken Mole and a recipie for Sweet Corn Tamales of my own.  This soup tastes better than the black bean soup I fell in love with while I was in Mexico.

Great recipe, although I definitely tweaked it to my liking. I sauteed 1/4 cup onion, clove of garlic, with chili infused olive oil. Instead of veg. broth, I used 1 cup water. Also, I used 1 can of kidney beans, 1 of black. Instead of salsa, I used a can of tomatoes with green chilies.  And because I like spice, I added a 3 ounce jar of jalapenos, extra cumin, and chili powder. I only blended about 1/2 of the mixture, and it was great....

What more can you say than how easy and how good this recipe is.  I add extra cumin (cumin is one of those ingredients I use a lot), a bit of chile powder to bring in a bit of earthiness and add in some fresh cilantro.  I let it simmer a long time to get all the flavors to blend well.  Instead of a blender, I haven't owned one in years, the immersion blender does just fine.  Oh and instead of vegetable stock I use chicken as I keep that around.

With the change of only processing 1/3 of the soup mixture apart from the soup and adding it back.  Also I added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  Good and fast!

I have never had a recipe that more people asked for than this one. It is simple, healthy and delicious. It's not the "prettiest" dish, but add a little cheese or sour cream on top and it "looks" great. I wouldn't change anything about it!

I really like this recipe!  Super easy.  I love adding a bunch of hot sauce, it gives it a nice kick and some saltiness.  Also, you won't notice a difference in taste if using no-fat sour cream.

I love black bean soup, but the way my mom makes it takes forever. This recipe is quick, simple and easy to make. I had pineapple salsa on hand the second time around and saved some black beans for the soup and it came out good. This recipe is a keeper.

This was pretty good.  I used hot salsa and only blended 1/2-3/4 of the mixture.

It's hard to beat this for a quick and easy meal.  Made it as written except we also put a few crumbled tortilla chips on top.  Wish I had more for leftovers.

We (Byron, Zarrin, and a friend) really liked this recipe! Quick and easy to make and we definitely agree with keeping some whole beans with the soup + some lime juice. Next time we're going to toast some tortillas strips and serve that over the soup.

This recipe is incredibly easy and very delicious. It tastes as good as a cream-based soup but you don't have to feel guilty eating it! I used low-fat sou cream. My boyfriend asks me to make him this all the time.

This recipe was pretty good. I added a small can of diced chiles to it, but it still didn't seem quite spicy enough. I didn't love this, but it was good enough and easy enough to make again.

This was actually pretty tasty and quite filling. The sour cream was just the perfect touch at the end!  I did add 1 c. of whole black beans, garlic powder and some lime juice. My husband loved it smooth, but next time I think that I will make it a little more chunky.

This is an awesome recipe because it is both delicious and so easy and quick to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add some garlic powder and cilantro to the pot.  Another reviewer also recommended some lime juice which I didn't have, but I can see how it would complement the dish well and will try this next time.

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, instead of putting everything into a food processor, I just mashed up the beans with a spoon (I guess I like my soup chunkier) and then added the rest of the ingredients to the pot. I also added 1/2 cup more vegetable broth and about 1/2 cup of frozen corn. I liked the soup better the second time, though both versions were delicious!

A reliable recipe that is delicious, easy, fast and healthy. I always use "no salt added" black beans and low sodium chicken broth because I am sodium concious. I have a stick blender, so I just mix it all up in a Pyrex bowl, pop it in the microwave and (with rolls or sandwiches and a small salad) there is one weeknight dinner. My family loves it.

This recipe is easy & delicious! A lot
of the flavor depends on the type of salsa used.  We used a full 12oz. jar of Trader Joe's roasted galic salsa.  It's fairly chunky and medium in intensity.
We're not fans of cumin so we substituted the same amount of chili powder.  This recipe was even easier w/ the use of our emulsion blender.  We omitted both the green onions & sour cream & added a small handful of shredded cheese instead. No doubt, we'll be making this recipe again!

This was the absolute best black bean soup I've ever had!  And it is also one of the easiest soup recipes ever!  I added a little bit of onion and garlic powder to give it more flavor and it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy to make, tasty and healthy (if you leave out the sour cream). The best part that you can alter the spiciness level by using a hotter or milder salsa.

This is so quick and easy yet so yummy!  I only puree one can of beans as we like more texture.  I add chili pepper as well as the cumin for a bit more flavor.  It goes well with empanadas or quesadillas for a complete dinner.

EASY, GOOD, HEALTHY, did I mention EASY!  I used chicken broth, and also topped with diced avocado.  Would probably be good served with diced bell pepper or cheese to be added if wished.

This was very good. I blended the beans and broth to a chunky consistency in the pot, heated it, and added freshly made salsa just before turning off the heat. I omitted the sour cream and added chopped avocado--delicious! The great thing about this soup is you can get so many different flavors, just based on the salsa you use. I'd like to try it with chili powder and fresh cilantro.

Surprisingly very good, I thought it may be too overpowering with the salsa or too bland with the black beans, but a exceptional complemen to one another!

I enjoyed this recipe alot. I did make a few minor changes I didn't add green onions because I didn't have any, I only pureed 1 can of the beans and added half a can of diced tomatoes. Two of my four kids even ate and thats good enough for me. :)

This was very good and so easy to make. I used my hand blender and then added some shredded chicken. I will definitely make this again.

This was a very tasty easy recipe to make. I had dinner done in 20 minutes! I added some ground turkey and garlic to make it more like a chili and I left some of the black beans whole. Will make it again!

Now why didn't I think of this before??  It ~almost~ sounds too easy to be THAT good... but it is!!  Scaled the recipe down for one (hearty) serving and found I prefer it with a little more heat (used a medium salsa), so I added some cayenne.  Crushed some low-fat tortilla chips on top and used f/f sour cream.  Excellent!

Great base recipe!  I, too, left one can of beans unblended.  I also added some other seasonings such as garlic powder, hot sauce, grill seasoning, chili powder, a tiny bit of liquid smoke, and a splash of red wine vinegar.  If I had had any cilantro, that would have been a great garnish-- some ground coriander would be good, too.  Overall, a very simple, easy, cheap and delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious. The texture of this soup is just perfect. I used hot salsa for a "kick". Definitely making this again.

I really love this recipe!  It's so easy to throw together when you don't have a plan for dinner, and we usually have the ingredients on hand.  Taste is very flavorful and is obviously varied by the type of salsa you use.  We've made this many times, including for a pumkin-carving party at Halloween where we had everyone bring a crock-pot of soup to share.  Got rave reviews!  Thanks for sharing such a yummy and fast recipe!

This was good, but nothing special. My husband gave it 3 stars for a soup and 5 stars for a dip.  It was healthy, and I liked it, but probably not enough to make again.

This soup was AWESOME! I like mine a little chunky, so next time I will probably not pulverize it, and I might add a little chicken! The taste was awesome and it was so fast and easy to make!! I will make this again and again!!

Totally loved this.  I used PACE's salsa with Cilantro.  I was concerned that the lack of ingredients was going to leave it very plain, but I was wrong.  I love Panera Bread's black bean soup, and this gives me the same taste.  Fabulous!

I made this soup last night and it was a HUGE hit.  I even ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning !!!  Even my 6 yr. old and 3 yr. old loved this.  I served with cilantro, green onions, sour cream, rice, limes, etc. so everyone could add what they liked.  It was gone in no time.   Quick, easy and delicious !!!

Best soup ever! Who would have thought that something so easy would taste so great! And it's hardly any calories! I just used fat free sour cream and when I went back for a second bowl, I didn't add sour cream! It still was wonderful! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I was skeptical of this recipe since it seems like a bunch of canned things thrown together, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was easy and delicious - sure to become a regular dish at our house.

Excellent and very quick.  I agree with the other recommendations to reserve 1/2 a can of beans.  Use hot, medium or mild salsa to suit your tastes.

Whipped this up at work in a blender for my Insanity workout meal (with 1/2 turkey sandwich).  I used low-sod chicken broth, no-added salt beans, and deli salsa.  The sour cream was omitted - and not necessary to enjoy this soup!  Very very yummy and inexpensive.

This was pretty good, and I'd make it again becaus it is so easy, but it seems to need a little more flavor. I served it with cornbread that my husband crumbled into it and he said that was what was missing...

Very good.  I had homemade fresh salsa on hand, so I doubled the salsa and omitted the broth altogether.  It was perfect.

This soup is great.  I took the advice of other users and left half a can of black beans, and I added some lime juice and cilantro.  My husband even enjoyed it and he doesn't like beans!

This soup has nice flavors overall. The other reviewers were right about the seasoning - you need to at least double the seasoning for the soup. Also, I blended only 1 can of beans because I like to have contrasting texture in my soup. The consistency of soup is a little certain given - it was too thick for soup but too watery over rice. I decided to add more broth when I was making the soup, and only half the amount when used it over rice. An easy versatile recipe.

I just didn't love this as the other reviewers had said.  It definitely needs more spices as I added a lot and we still found it to be a bit bland.  It was okay, but I probably won't be making it again unles I can think of something to make it more interesting.

This was SO easy and absolutley fantastic! My boyfriend was so impressed when he came home to this delicious soup when I had worked all day! I did as others suggested and didn't blend about a half can of the beans, along with that I added a few dashes of creole seasoning, and topped it with sliced jalapenos instead of green onion. Either way, this recipe was by far a 5 star recipe! I served this with mexican pannini sandwiches and my boyfriend just raved!

Just made this tonight and I really enjoyed the taste of the beans and salsa combined to create a soup, I would have given this a 5 star rating if it had some kind of "texture" to it. Perhaps I will add whole beans along with some sauteed onions or some veggies. I love the sour cream and green oinions added before serving! Very tasty and I had all the ingredients in the pantry already!

This tasted great :-) I added about a tablespoon of dessert pepper fat free black bean dip, which added some flavor, even though it probably was not needed!

Excellent recipe.  I will make again and again.  The only changes I made....I used chicken broth.  I actually boiled the green onions, cilantro, and added a little white onion and garlic.  I also cooked everything thoroughly AND THEN beat the mixture within the pan so I didn't have to dirty the blender.  I topped with the sour cream and a little cheddar cheese.  So good and healthy.

I liked it mainly for the flavor, but I had to add a lot of Tabasco to it.  My 4 year old loved to help with this one.
(She did not like to eat it though, as with my husband and son, they were not impressed.)  Super easy though

Simple, fast, tastes great.

I would say that anyone who does not like this easy recipe, probably does not like black bean soup.  I added some fresh ground pepper.  The sour cream is key to adding a nice opposite of texture and taste.

Check out my picture! :)

Unbelievably fast, easy, healthy and DELICIOUS. Also makes an awesome dip for tortilla chips. This is my favorite black bean soup recipe! I do leave out the onions though.

So so good!  I only blended half of the black beans and used hot Pace Chunky Salsa.  My husband loves spicy food and the hot salsa added just the right extra kick.  I also added some chopped red onion.

Perhaps it was the brand of salsa that I used. After it sat for a while, it got a little better. No one touched it.

I recommend eating the soup with toasted soft tortillas..... yummmmmmmmmy!

I really liked this soup. I once made a different black bean and salsa soup recipe, but didn't like it at
all - this one is MUCH better (perhaps the blending and the dash of cumin
really make the difference). I opted to add one can of beans after blending (which I did with an immersion blender for a meatier feel). I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and a few squirts of lime juice. Passed on the sour cream and green onions. YUMMY, quick and easy. :)

Very flavorful and good.  Supper just doesn't get much quicker and healthier than this.  I used chicken broth and cilantro salsa.  Next time I'm planning on chopping up a turkey keilbasa to add to the soup.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe is great!  I just used one 16 ounce jar of salsa with 2 cans black beans. One of the two brands of beans did seem a bit liquidy.  So, I drained it a touch. The texture turned out perfect!

This soup was excellent and very quick to make!  I threw in some canned chopped tomatoes with garlic as well as some red onion.  I topped it with chopped green onion, cilantro and a bit of sour cream! (I also only pureed half the beans).  It is quite spicy but it suited me.

One word - yum! We added rice to the recipe to thicken up the soup. Other than that, we were true to what's stated. Spicy salsa gave it a great kick!

it was FAST AND EASY to make.  the only thing barring it from 5 stars is that it needed a little more "kick" for my husband to like it.  i'll just spice it more next time.  ALSO, it makes a great chip dip!

My husband was a little skeptical when I first described this recipe, but after he tasted it he was sold!  I serve it with a salad and tortilla chips (my family likes the organic blue chips).

So very simple, and truly delicious!  I omitted the sour cream, as we don't need the extra fat.  A handful of sliced scallions made a nice, colorful garnish.  Would also be pretty presented with some tortilla strips and diced tomato.  Very healthy and satisfying.  Definitely a keeper (would be great for company as well) - might freeze up a batch of this for unexpected guests!!

Excellent soup. I took the advice to reduce the amount of broth and also saved a 1/2 cup of the black beans to add to the soup whole. Very tasty.Thanks! Will try as a dip sometime too.

WOW!!WOW!! This happened to be the first recipe that I have tried off this site and it is the most wonderful soup.  So much flavor.  I added a bit of fresh cilantro to it and follwed the others advice in reducing the broth by 1/2 a cup.  A new favorite of mine!!!

A great, super easy recipe. Instead of the salsa, I sauteed some garlic and onions and then blended them with the beans and broth. One of the easiest, and best, soups I've ever made.

For such a simple recipe, this has a lot of flavor.  I too add another can of beans (whole) for extra chunkiness, plus some fresh cilantro.

So easy and it tastes great!  I only had half a jar of salsa and we didn't have sour cream and it was still a hit.  It was ready in just a few minutes. Like others, I like soup a bit chunkier so I used a potatoe masher and mashed the beans till I got the consistency that I liked. I will definitely make this again.

Definitely leave at least half the beans whole for texture.  I used chicken broth and loved this soup.

I was looking for a recipe that would imitate the black bean soup at one of my favorite restaurants, and this was it.  My husband, kids, and siblings LOVED it.  Since I didn't have any vegetable broth in my house, I used chicken flavored granules, and that was fine.  Also, I didn't want to pull out my blender and wash it, so I used my handheld blender instead.  The soup may not have been as smooth as the recipe indicated, but we all like a chunky soup anyway.

YUM! The best soup i've had in a long time. Didn't have two cans of beans so I used one can and one can of corn.  I mashed 1/2 of the beans.  I took one reveiwer's advice and topped with cheese and added the sour cream. Topped that with chives. A keeper.

I gave this three stars because it was so easy.
It made for a healthy meal in a pinch but it was nothing special.

This is so easy and tasty. I leave one can of beans whole so the soup isn't too gloppy. Excellent!

This recipe was excellent. I took the advice of other users and did not blend all the black beans. This gave the soup a little more texture.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and found that this gave the soup a little bit better flavor. Overall this recipe is great! I will definitely make it again.

This was YUMMY!  I was skeptical but had to try it because of the wonderful reviews it has been receiving.  I'm glad I did!  I added 3 teaspoons cumin instead of 1 and also added a can of mexicorn.  Yum!

This was a great recipe!  Extremely easy to make, tastes great and freezes very well.  If you want a little meat with your soup just add a little cooked ground beef or sausage.

I needed a quick soup recipe and had the few ingredients this called for. I'm a huge black bean soup fan and was planning on just a so so dish. This is a GREAT soup! Easy quick and tasty. This is definitely a new addition to our soup recipes. A must eat!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I served it at a soup nite party and got raves.  I then served it at home with veggie quesadillas and also got raves.

Recently, went to a soup/chili and ale party, lots of people and lots of soup/chili to choose from.  I doubled the recipe and it still was not enough. The pot was empty in no time at all and everyone was asking for the recipe. This recipe is so easy and delicious! Thanks

This is great.  I use fat free sour cream instead and then recommend it to fellow Weight Watchers as a great low point dinner.

After it was so EASY to put together, I thought, "There is no way this is going to taste THAT great." Well, it DID taste that great! I tried it out on my playgroup moms, and 7 out of 8 moms wanted the recipe! One of our preschoolers even liked it! Thanks Maryanne!

Great soup.  Very good hot or cold.  Very easy to play with should you want to vary the recipe.  Thanks Maryanne.
