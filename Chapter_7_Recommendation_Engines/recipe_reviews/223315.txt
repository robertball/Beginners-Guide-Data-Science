I made these one night because I thought the idea was so cool, and that m kids would like them due to them being little individual servings. Blah is all I can say. The concept was cool, but the wonton were soggy on the bottom and too crispy on the top. I did alter slightly by adding half pound lean ground beef so it would be more substantial.

This is so easy. I added browned spicy sausage to give it a little more body.

I really enjoyed these alot, although I did add cooked ground beef to the sauce.  Pretty easy to make, too!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

just made these, i cut back on sauce after reading the last comment, added some ground pork, and a little sauce on top of the last won ton also to keep it from drying out, i think they turned out pretty good this way, and fairly simple and quick to make
