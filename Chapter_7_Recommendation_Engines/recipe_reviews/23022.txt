Very tasty, had to make a few seasoning changes: added 2 packets of Goya sazon seasoning, some garlic salt, and a good amount of the red pepper sauce.I also reduced the amount of water to 3 1/2 cups so it would not be watery (i feel that 5 cups is too much). I served this dish with white rice, avocado salad and baked plantains. Excellent dish! Will make again and again! Just make sure that you season it well, and, like i said, dont overdo it with the water.

I was very disappointed (and, my husband was politely silent).  In hindsight, I should have realized it would not be to my taste.  The first time with a recipe, I try to follow the recipe closely - and, it turns out, there really is no seasoning and hence little taste to this recipte.

I'm on the South Beach Diet and had to make just a few modifications because I lacked a couple of ingredients. Even with substitutions, it was terrific! My husband and his friend loved it too. Thanks!

might be ok for shrimp but not a very smart combo of flavors to showcase the delicate flavor of lobster i love cajun cooking and would not waste the money on tails to hide it in this mess of flavors. subtle hints of ingredients should come together as the base in true creole cooking you could try reducing the onion, pepper, and tomato. and omit the tomato paste all together and simply cook your sauce longer before adding shellfish, should help with the overall balance

I made this recipe on a rainy Saturday and we loved it.  It was very good.  My husband really enjoyed it, he ate it until he couldn't eat anymore.  I will definitely make it again. Thanks!
