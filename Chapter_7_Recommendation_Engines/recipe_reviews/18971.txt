I blended all ingredients except the soda and sherbert the day before and froze--worked great, bananas didn't turn brown.  I also used pineapple sherbert since lemon was terribly expensive and it tasted wonderful!

This is a great punch recipe.  Even the picky kids liked it.  We will certainly be using this at our next gathering.

I am shocked that more people haven't tried this...it is extremely good!!! I almost filled up on this punch before we even ate our meal it is that good. Will definately be making again. I couldn't find any lemon sherbert, but I did find lemon sherbert with berry swirl, I used that, and it was AWESOME!!! You gotta try this.

This was a hit at our Christmas Eve dinner, and again two days later at my nephew's birthday party! I was unable to find lemon sherbet so I used raspberry sherbet, which gave the punch a lovely appealing color!

My friends and family were not sold on this punch. We belnded the bananas/cream early in the day, which made the whole thing kind of grey and unappealing looking. Although I liked the creaminess of it, I think I would make a more traditional punch the next time.

I made this for an Easter brunch. It was slightly tart (I would reduce the lemon juice next time). We called it "banana punch" but it is a lovely white color. I also used pineapple sherbet because I couldn't find lemon.

The family and I did not care for this recipe at all. It was too creamy for everyone's taste. Small deviation...I used lime sherbet for added color and different flavor...did some experimentation and still couldn't make it work.

 For a suggested improvement, it might be better blended with ice and served with alcohol. To me, it was more of a tropical daiquiri.
