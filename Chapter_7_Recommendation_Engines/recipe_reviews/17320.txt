I made these for my husband who LOVES chocolate covered raisins.  They were a huge hit!!!  Only change I made was to substitute butter flavored crisco for the butter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These turned out great, everyone loved them.  They're obviously very rich though, but hey that's what cookies SHOULD be!  I used sweet cocoa but next time I think I will use unsweetened- there is enough sugar to make up the sweetness in the rest of the recipe.

Excellen cookie.    These are so soft and chewy.  Only hard part is not eating all the chocolate covered raisins before they go in the recipe!

I usually don't like soft cookies, but this one is great, even better than the "CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES I" that I reviewed on this site a few months ago. I think I might try it with plain raisins instead of chocolate-covered raisins, or even with chocolate chips.

This is a wonderfully moist cookie. I would compare it to the moistness of a brownie. My kids loved them. Even my daughter who doesn't like raisins likes these.
