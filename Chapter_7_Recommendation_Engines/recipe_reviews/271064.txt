Marvelous recipe! Some of the best chili I’ve had in a long time. Made it with a family recipe for marinated Serrano peppers instead of jalapeños and it added a lot of kick to it. Also I loved the addition of rice it adds a lot to the chili. Thank you for posting this, definitely gonna make it again soon!

I made it and it was so good; I made it again! I didn’t however, use the rice portion of the recipe and I added kidney beans for another source of protein. We like it alone but LOVE it for our vegan nachos! I would recommend this one for sure! One day, I’ll add the rice too but the nachos seem to be our summer favorite right now!

Everyone loved it. Even the meat eaters! Think I'll put a little less rice or more tomatoes next time though.

It was very tasty, the small serving size really made it easier to purge it with ipecac solution. I loved the after-burn when it came up too! Anyway I probably didn't even need to purge because my hair fell out from lack of nutrients.  Also did you know I'm vegan
