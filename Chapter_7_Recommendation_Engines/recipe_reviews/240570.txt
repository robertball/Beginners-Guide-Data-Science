I used cream as I didn't have evaporated milk on hand, and I added a bit of shredded cheese to the mixture. They turned out fantastic! Everyone went back for seconds!

Yes you are correct. 5lbs would make 20 burgers it won't let me edit that number.  Nice catch

Awesome. First time having venison and I'm a fan. I used turkey peppered bacon and used regular skim milk... only made one pound of venison so wasn't going to open a can of milk for a couple teaspoons.  BTW.. the full recipe makes 20 burgers, not 5.. otherwise the burgers would be a full pound  + each
