A very quick and easy Alfredo sauce, was a tad thin for my liking, so I added in more cream cheese and a bit more Parmesan to thicken it up. I used fresh spinach and it worked fine, cooked down nicely, you need a lot, I used the whole 9 ounce bag of it. We grilled chicken and cut it into bite sized pieces and served it all over fettuccine noodles. Was a great meal, better than Olive Garden.

One of the reasons why some had said that the sauce was a little thin, was because they used frozen spinach right out of thepackage without draining it. If you use frozen spinach, make sure that you SQEEZE the spinach to get all the extra water out of it. Frozen spinach is loaded with water that it will thin the sauce noticably.
Enjoy!

Excellent! I used half the amount of spinach & it was still thick & fabulous! I also made half batch without spinach & that was very thin, still tasty just thin. Made for "thebuzz" Recipe Group 9/3/13.

Outstanding! My family loved this recipe. I used fresh spinach (because that was all I had) and added 1\2 of a huge mushroom I had leftover from another recipe. When I make this again, I will probably use fresh spinach and mushrooms again. I only had 6 oz of heavy cream and topped off the measuring cup with milk. I used a couple spoonfuls of potato flakes as a thickener (could not taste potato in the finished product.) I only mention this in case someone else finds themselves short on cream or frozen spinach. ??

Perfect way to get my little guy to eat spinach!  This is a delicious creamy alfredo recipe that will be a keeper in my house.  Went perfect with a salad and breadsticks.

Oh My WOW! This is most definitely better than Olive Garden or any other Alfredo sauce I've eaten. My 6 year old is the pickiest eater when it comes to pasta dishes and asked if we could have this again tomorrow night!

I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, used 1/2 to 3/4 of a block of cream cheese (store brand 1/3 less fat version) because of other reviewers stating that the sauce had been too thin, and I didn't use spinach for my first try. Served it over 3 cheese tortellini with chopped chicken and I will definitely be trying it again!

Recipe Group Selection 8/31/2013 -  Let me just say, thank goodness I have a gym membership.  I used the full 10 oz. package of chopped spinach which ended up being about 1 cup of chopped spinach.  It was very good and everyone enjoyed it but it's not something I would make too often.

Made this for Recipe Group. I've never made alfredo before. I used a 10 oz package of spinach (didn't know what else to do with the small remaining amount). Also I used half and half just because I didn't have heavy cream in the fridge. Mine tasted good but was a bit watery, probably because of my changes. So,  I added the remainder of the 8 oz package of cream cheese; that helped. Also, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to squeeze out all the water from the thawed spinach. I didn't do that- wasn't sure if it needed some water to "cook" in. Next time I would press the water out.

For a thicker sauce just use 3-4 tablespoons of cream cheese and 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of half and half (or heavy whipping cream).  I do not use the butter, and I think it helps keep the sauce from running too thin (plus it's healthier). 

As I stir the cooked pasta, spinach & garlic, and the cream cheese, I splash half-half along the way to make sure my sauce doesn't get too thin. If it does get too thin, you can simmer it down by turning the heat on high and adding more cream cheese. Hope that helps :)

I thought this was just ok. Thinner than I expected and almost too salty; for all those calories, I wanted perfection. I did add red pepper flakes at the end and that perked up the flavor. There was a ton leftover, so maybe it'll taste better the second time around.

This sauce was a great base. Saute  a 1/2 cup onion and red pepper in butter with 1 tsp Italian seasoning and 1 Tablespoon chopped garlic.  Make sure the spinach is hand squeezed out the get out the excess moisture.  Cut butter in half net time as it was swimming in butter and we are a butter loving family.

I used fresh spinach and 2 minced garlic cloves, other than that,  I followed the recipe as written.  I tossed the sauce with rigatoni pasta and topped it off with slices of grilled chicken breasts.  Delicious!

Made this for Recipe Group...I LOVE alfredo, and this was a great one! I used a bit more cream cheese and fresh spinach. I really liked the addition of the spinach for something different. I also liked that this wasn't quite as heavy as the usual alfredo. I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a very quick and forgiving sauce. I had less than the needed amount of cream, so I added just a little more cream cheese. I also used some fresh spinach I had frozen for smoothies. I just followed the general instructions, added some left-over turkey breast from the night before, and served it over pasta for my husband and zucchini noodles for me. Delicious!

What a great (and easy!) recipe.  I served it as a side dish with chicken and ribs for 12 and everybody raved.  I followed the recipe as written but added one ingredient.  On the diagonal I cut carrot slices about 1/8 inch thick and pan seared with olive oil until crisp tender and then added to the recipe.  It really complimented the spinach and cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe.  As many others have said, "It's a keeper".   Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Debbie

This was ok, but be sure to squeeze your frozen, thawed spinach until all most dry, otherwise your sauce will be thinner.

Probably the best recipe I've found on this site. I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, and used a whole box of cream cheese. HIGHLY recommend these modifications!

This was a very simple recipe, which is a major plus. However, as others have said, it is very thin. I ended up adding another ounce of cream cheese and a bit more spinach (because I love it!). It goes just fine with grilled chicken added. This recipe doesn't have much flavor, but a little bit of salt and pepper, fresh parsley, and shredded Parmesan on top  goes a long way.

Followed the recipe with the exception of substituting the heavy whipping cream for the half and half and I used fresh spinach. It was simple, delicious and easy to make. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used the portion calculator and made it for 2.  I used some sliced mushrooms and fresh spinach.  I also used goat cheese instead of cream cheese.  We enjoyed it more than any other aflredo we have eaten  anywhere.  Delicious

Say no to frozen spinach, too watery. Also use 1-1/2 cups of good quality (i.e. fresh) parmesan cheese. Add a little at a time and stir constantly. That will get it thicker for you.

Delicious recipe, just be sure to squeeze the water from the frozen spinach before putting spinach in the sauce.
I think this recipe is a great base recipe and anything is possible with it!

Your recipe is pretty good! I basically add the same ingredients except the "cream cheese" due to the fat content but I suppose you could use low fat neufchatel instead. There are a couple things I do to maximize flavor; I prepare the chicken ahead of time, pierce it before marinating it in my tri-citrus marinade overnight using pineapple juice, slash of lemon & lime and even some orange juice with diced onion, green onion, red peppers, paprika, garlic and a bunch of other stuff (lol...salt, pepper..that sort of thing) to make it flavorful, juicy & tender....baste it while I bake it...Now you may think citrus chicken would clash with the alfredo sauce but it doesn't because it just adds a nice juiciness & flavor to it...then I tear it and toss it in with cooked homemade spaghetti (into which I have incorporated a little extra flavor by way of a pinch of salt, some parsley & garlic for push in flavor); then I added a heaping tbsp of my secret French ingredient...that's right...le mayonnaise! I throw in some mozzarella & parmesan cheese...Gives it another little boost (not too much mayo so that you can identify as an ingredient..just enough for flavor)! It turned out pretty good!! Thanks for sharing!

We ate it and liked it ok.  It didn't have a very firm flavor though, and it didn't have enough of the sauce/spinach mixture to cover the pasta well.  I'll use the recipe again, but only as a base.

I used more than the recommended spinach because I didn't want to waste any of the package after I defrosted it. Everyone who ate it loved it. My spinach haters unfortunately refused to try it. It was super  easy to make and I will make it again.

I used what I had on hand so I tweaked a bit. I used a full box of frozen chopped spinach, only 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream and about 1/2 cup of cream cheese. I also added some minced garlic after all the cheeses had melted together. This was delicious!!
I also used with few different pastas I had in the pantry. Some shells and some rotini.

After reading some of the comments, my fiance and I decided to add an extra tablespoon of cream cheese to thicken the sauce, but we only had Parmesan mixed with Asiago and Romano cheese which I think made the flavor a little off. However, it was very good for our first time making alfredo and we will definitely be trying it again!

I used fresh spinach and mine wAs a little runny too but i just kept adding more parmesan and that fixed it. I would say use 12 oz instead of 16 on the whipping cream or just plan on extra parmesan.

Someone said people complaining that its too thin is because they used frozen spinach and didn't drain it. I used fresh spinach and its still very thin. I added truffle oil, mushrooms and 2 garlic cloves to the spinach mixture. Also added chicken and a teaspoon of crushed red peppers. Omg made it taste so amazing. Again, just too thin.

Absolutely the best Alfredo sauce that I have ever eaten.  Omitted the garlic powder as a favor to my wife but it was still phenomenal. I read some other reviews that said the sauce was too thin. That last step of simmering is critical. It becomes nice and creamy.

I didn't have any frozen spinach so I used fresh cooked  broccoli, left over chicken and increased the cream cheese to 8 oz.  I added 8 oz of cooked small shell pasta put it all in a small cake pan and baked for about 20 min. @ 350 followed by 3 minutes of broiling it.  I think the extra cream cheese was too over powering for me, felt like it needed more seasoning.  My husband loved it.

Many people are going to find the changes I had to make sacrilegous, so continue reading at your own risk. ;) 
I had no heavy cream, so I dissolved a spoonful of cornstarch into a cup and a half of regular milk and used that instead of the cream. I didn't need it to yield so much either, so I used about half a cup of butter or maybe a little less, with the same amount of parmesan and cream cheese and about a cup of spinach. I thought a bit of nutmeg would go well with it, so i added that as well. I had it over farfalle and my boyfriend had a chicken thigh with it. It turned out great. I've never been to Olive Garden, so I don't know what this is supposed to be better than, but I really liked this recipe and the version I ended up making has less fat in it, so I thought it might come in handy for some people. 
Thank you for sharing it!

I added  a extra garlic, basil and a six pepper seasoning.   I also added shrimp and cut a few grape tomatoes  as well.  The original sauce was to thin so I added corn starch to thicken and it was delish!!

This is AWESOME.  Yes, I thawed and drained the frozen spinach before use.  I also added an extra tbs. of cream cheese.  When it was done I cooked some pasta.  While that was cooking I dipped pita chips in this, Delicious!!!  Then I had the pasta with this sauce on it.  Yes, I will make this again

Made this with fresh spinach ( could and should have added a little more) about a cup chopped. After letting it simmer, added in the rest of my breakfast bacon already cooked and chopped, some freshly cooked shrimp and then tossed in the fettuccini noodles and let warm. Oh man was that a good meal!

This is quick, easy and delicious. You can add any protein you like. The first time I made this I added grilled shrimp on angel hair pasta. The next time chicken. My husband just loves it and thinks he lives in a fine restaurant. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Btw, I made this exactly as written.

Very simple  recipe, but very flavorful. All one has to do is follow the recipe. The choice of adding any protein is completely up to you. I added microwaved meatballs because I wanted to make the dish more substantial as a meal.

This was a really tasty and quick recipe. I followed the recipe but with a few changes. I used frozen spinach and substituted asiago cheese for the Parmesan. I also used more cream cheese and added fresh mushrooms and chicken. It was delicious!  I will make this again!

Absolutely amazing recipe for what we're calling "cheap" Alfredo.  Definitely read the comments and drain the spinach.  We added mushrooms with the spinach (will add before next time), about 25% more butter to account for the mushrooms, and grilled chicken (salt and pepper) which was added right before the mushrooms were done cooking.  Don't be afraid to kick up the temp to medium while cooking the veggies and while reducing down.

We actually forgot to add the garlic powder for half the first serving....its a whole different meal which is also worthy of 5 stars.

Might be the best "easy" recipe on All Recipes.

I've made this several times andI only made two changes..thought it would be thin as other reviewers had commented. Less cream, and added Italian herbs. Tasted great. Just the right thickness. The cream cheese is not traditional, but adds some smoothness and less tendency to separate when reheated. It needs no salt.

This is really yummy. The problem is it is too runny and to much oil. I used sour cream instead of the heavy cream. I ended up simmering the penne pasta in the pot to soak up some of the water. It came out the perfect consistency after it cooled. The next time I will use only one Tbsp of butter to cut the oil and maybe real garlic as there is nothing like the real thing. I also used fresh spinach which worked fine.

This was very good.  I thought I had cream cheese, but I didn't, so I just let the sauce boil a little extra to thicken (since a number of reviewers mentioned it being too runny).  I'll make this again. thanks!!

Kids loved it! I sautéed garlic in olive oil with the spinach. Lots of flavor with real minced garlic from a jar in supermarket produce area. Quick tasty meal.  We used penne and the sauce. Yum!

Essentially followed recipe using fresh spinach, extra cream cheese and parma for thickness, a tad of ground garlic from jar, and a tad of nutmeg.  Delicious and EASY!!  Does not make a lot.  Takes a full 16 oz of fresh spinach.

This came out better than I thought it would. I didn't have any heavy cream, but I had 1/2 & 1/2, so I was a little concerned.  Not to worry, such a tasteful"sauce".  I will make this very easy and very yummy recipe again and I will probably just stick to the 1/2 & 1/2 as a replacement. Just a note, I did have freshly grated parmesan as the recipes lists, so   I'm sure that made a big difference than using pre-packaged!

I have no point of reference for this recipe, as I have not tried Olive Garden's, but this was amazing!  I followed the recipe as directed and it turned out perfect...not too thick, not too thin, great flavor!  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Easy to make with fresh spinach too--I steam-cooked the spinach for about 5 minutes, drained and chopped a bit, then returned it to the pan to saute with butter and chopped garlic. I used coconut cream instead of cow for health reasons and lots of grated goat cheese.

I really liked this recipe.  I think the people that had the runny sauce, probably didn't squeeze the water out of their spinach out before they began.  I did wring out the excess water from the spinach, and my sauce was perfect. The only thing I did different from the original recipe was substitute ricotta for cream cheese, because I ran out, but that was it. Really yummy, and everyone in the family liked it.

This is a great Alfredo sauce recipe, thank you.  I also used fresh garlic and fresh spinach.  I reduced the sauce a little longer, and served with Roasted chicken and steamed potatoes.  Leftovers of course, will be a great addition to bow tie pasta.

very good -- I  use half and half cream, fresh spinach, fresh garlic( several cloves minced) -  it thicken  nicely  and I think a chicken breast - grilled and cut up,  would  go well  with this dish to  make it heartier , but  was very  good  as is and would make again --!

I used mascarpone cheese and fresh kale and it was AWESOME! 
I also used fresh garlic cloves smashed through a garlic press, but that was because I had no garlic powder and I I garlic cloves...

i will definitely make this again. Very simple and easily adaptable. I used fresh spinach, added some leftover onion and a portabello mushroom and added Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple. I added leftover rotissiere chicken. I used more cream cheese per the suggestion in order to make a little thicker. I may try half and half next time.  It's lacking some sort of seasoning or flavor that neither my kid nor I can pinpoint yet.

I'm not sure what to think of this. I'm neither from the USA nor particularly fond of Italian cuisine, so I really have no term of comparison. This tasted ok enough but, instead of watery like other reviewers mention, mine turned out extremely sticky, there's just much too much parmesan in this. If I ever try it again, I'll add a bit more spinach and about 1/10 of the parmesan.

Good recipe. I followed the recipe but changed it a bit: sauted fresh mushrooms and spinach instead of frozen, substituted evaporated 2% milk instead of cream and light cream cheese. I would add a pinch of nutmeg next time and a bit more cheese. The cream cheese really adds a creamy texture, nice recipe, thanks for sharing!

Yum! I followed directions exactly except I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and paprika and sautéed some baby bell mushrooms in the butter before adding the spinach. This is a keeper!

I was concerned with the amount of fat with all the butter and cream so i used half the cream and butter and subbed milk and margarine. Also added Roasted Red peppers for color. delicious!

This is yummy! Everyone in my family agreed that it needs to be on our regular rotation. Even my son, who doesnt love spinach, ate every bite.

This recipe was very quick and easy, making it a good one for us on a busy work/school night. I served it over cheese tortellini, but would put it over any pasta. 

My only complaint is that it's hard to make it and not think about all the calories in this dish! But that's OK once in a while. I'm sure concerned  cooks could make some modifications to reduce the fat and calories a bit of they wanted.

Fresh garlic and fresh spinach for a fresher, better taste!!! I also sautéed some shallot with the garlic. I probably used 4oz of cream cheese for a richer flavor. I like my sauce a little thicker, so made a loose roux out of the butter before adding the cream. I used a combination of heavy cream, half n half and milk. Definitely a keeper at our house!

Excellent recipe just as written.   I found it thick enough, although I probably did cook it down a little.   It does need a little salt and pepper, but that is a given in most recipes.   I will not change a thing the next time that I make this recipe.

This was delicious.  Only thing I did different was thicken it a bit at the end with a cornstarch slurry.  YUMMY!

My first time making home made Alfredo and this was a hit.  My family absolutely loved it.  I added sausage and mushrooms and seasoned to my taste but would have to conclude this we very simple to make, tastey and filling.

It was a hit with the family!  Added a bit more cream cheese to thicken it up and added chicken.  Next time will try mushrooms and/or olives.

Seriously better than Olive Garden! Don't look any further for the perfect Alfredo recipe. I did not use spinach and traded the garlic powder for 11/2 Tbl chopped garlic. I had to cook it for almost double the time in the recipe (about 20 min) for it to thicken but it coated the noodles beautifully and was so rich and creamy the extra time was absolutely worth it!

Soooo good! I used a little less spinach the first time I made it, and let me tell you, it was not all that great. When I used the recommended amount the second time, it was so fabulous that even my picky little sister ate it. Greatest spinach recipe ever!

Very easy to make. I halved the recipe, used fresh spinach and added a bit of red pepper flakes. It was also a little thin for my taste so I added a little corn starch mixed with water and it ended up a great consistency. Didn't need to add any salt.

ok, i substituted some ingredients- I used a handful of shredded co-jack cheese instead of the parmesan, as I didn't have any parmesan. I also subbed swiss chard instead of the spinach as I had a bag frozen, I thawed it and squeezed out the water before adding to the sauce. I also added mushrooms. I also added half a block of cream cheese. 
It needed pepper- (I added red pepper flakes) didn't have any of that either- but with all these substitutions it was still great! I'm sure it'd be 5 star with the original recipe! Next time I will make sure I have the parmesan and black pepper!!

Wow!  I normally just take recipes I find online and tweak them to my liking. No need here, I did use garlic salt instead of the garlic powder and salt, but . . . Wow. I actually made an account just to add this recipe. Small tip, the 3/4 c of thawed spinach is just under a 9 oz package. Even if you had a 10 oz one, just use the whole thing so you don't have to bother measuring, turns out great too. Thanks for this recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  31, August 2013 ~ This is a delicious Alfredo sauce that I served over tri-colored veggie pasta.  I did use fresh spinach rather than frozen.  My sauce was thinner than the actual recipe, but that was by choice.  I used milk rather than heavy whipping cream.  The results were a dish that we really enjoyed, and my husband is not a fan of spinach!  This is the first recipe he has ever complimented me on that contained spinach.  That say A LOT about the recipe.  Thanks nbrock_85 for sharing your recipe.
