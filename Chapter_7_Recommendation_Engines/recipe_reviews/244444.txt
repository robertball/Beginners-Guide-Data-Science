Perfect way to grill shrimp. I loved this recipe.  We served it with filet mignon and asparagus. A little surf and turf on a Tuesday night. My husband said it was good, but definitely did not enjoy like I did. I would definitely make this again. Thanks.

My family loved this recipe!!! Lucky for them I doubled the recipe and we had plenty of shrimp for everyone. The marinade was spectacular with a wonderful garlic and  lemon flavor. The spices were delicate and not overpowering. This recipe would be great for a tapas night or as a topping on pasta, rice, etc...  Using Reynolds non stick on the grill made cooking the shrimp an easy task with no mess and cleaning was a breeze . This recipe is a keeper!!!

I did not change the ingredients except to double, since I had a 2 pound bag of shrimp to use. I put them in the oven instead of grilling and they were delicious. I used a large baking sheet and baked at 425 for about 3 minutes on each side-6 minutes total. I will also try this on chicken or pork.

This was very good. We used Old Bay for the seafood seasoning; and I paired the shrimp with creamy grits a la Loveless Cafe in Nashville! Will make it again...rather than foil, my husband grilled them using a grilling mesh, which worked great.

The marinade is great. I had a pound of 16-20 shrimp which I grilled right on the grate with the skins on after marinating for about 4 hours. They came out beautifully with a nice char on the skin and a really nice citrus/garlic flavor. Therefore, my review is for the marinade only, as I did not try the foil grilling technique. Will make again for sure.

These were excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly minus the lemon pepper because I didn't have any, so subbed for 1/2 of the called for in garlic pepper. I didn't really get any spice, but they had great flavor.   Will definitely make again.

Easy & very good. 

2nd time, I used lime juice instead of lemon, and preferred it.

No need to peel the shrimp in advance, as the recipe calls for (apparently the author knew this based on the photo & prep time given. No editors?)

These were delicious. The Worcestershire sauce added a nice flavor to the classic combo of garlic and lemon. The foil made it easy to grill (no sticking!) and easier to clean up. I'll definitely make this again.

Really yummy! Especially if you love garlic (which we do)! Using the nonstick Reynold's Wrap on the grill was genius! You could actually just toss the shrimp around rather than having to flip each one individually and the marinade didn't all just drip off into the grill.

These flavored were excellent together! Just enough spicy and savory to balance the lemon juice, and was SUPER easy to cook thanks to the nonstick foil on the grill. Now I never have to waste time putting shrimp on skewers again!
