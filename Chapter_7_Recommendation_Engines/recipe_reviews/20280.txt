Easy and quick to make with a nice texture, light and fluffy with a crispy coating.  Make sure to keep the balls small so that you can cook it all the way through without getting the outside too burned.  I would suggest about one inch balls at medium heat for about 15-30 seconds each side until just lightly golden.  I didn't have coconut milk and used fat free evaporated milk which may have taken away from some of the flavor.  The cardamom and cinnamon complemented well though.  I added some raisins to a few of the puffs which worked fine too.  I didn't have self rising flour and substituted regular flour with some baking powder (about 1-1 1/2 tsp) which seemed to work fine.  I also lightened it up with splenda instead of sugar.  It would probably go well coated in powdered sugar or maple syrup or honey as well.  Over all easy to make and good for a quick treat, dessert, or breakfast for guests or family.

they were quick and easy to make, but the frying took some time. It was really difficult to drop balls into the oil without them separating... so I suggest dropping in SMALL balls. They expand a little anyway. Also didn't have self-rising flour, so just used regular flour + 1 tsp baking powder. They taste good with honey or powdered sugar. oh, and i like them soft inside (tried both cooked all the way and not so cooked), so I ended up not cooking most of them all the way.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any cardamom so I added a shake or two of ginger.  They came out like a very rich, slightly bland funnel cake.  Make sure you cook them all the way...they should not be soft.  Might try again to find another spice to go with it.

This was easy and fast, being that I was craving for something sweet to eat.  I didn't have any self rising flour, so I just used a pack of yeas and added a bit more flour; I let it sit for a while before frying.

Indians call this Gulab Jamun.  Excellent dessert.  Try marinating the fried balls in a rose water syrup and serve warm or chilled at the end of a traditional Indian curry meal.  Delicious.
