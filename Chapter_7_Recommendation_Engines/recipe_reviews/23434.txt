I tried posting this recipe a while ago. No wonder it never made it. It was already here! I do a couple things differently. I slice the potatoes and fresh carrots extremely thin as if making potato chips. Layer the potatoes on bottom of casserole dish, sprinkle  with salt and pepper, layer with carrots, salt and pepper, sprinkle with raw long grain wild rice, 2/3 of a bag of frozen peas, topped with grounded beef browned with the onions and green pepper. I use a full can of tomato soup and 3/4 can of water or so. Cover and bake 1 hour 15 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes longer. Top with shredded cheddar cheese and return to oven until melted. My family LOVES this recipe. The kids always request it for their birthday meal. It takes a little time to cut the veggies so thinly and the baking time is long, but it's a winner every time. Have tried it with cream of mushroom soup, but we prefer the tomato.

This is very similar to the "Seven Layer Dinner" recipe passed on to me by my mother.  It's a great cold weather, filling meal.  Our version uses browned ground beef instead of sausage.  Also, I use frozen peas with water instead of canned.

This was so good . and everyone in the house finished there plates. Something that doesn't happen all the time at a house of picky eaters. The only thing that I would say is try it with corn in place of the carrots it is even better or my family  says so.

This was pretty good.  I agree that it was better the next day because the flavors really had a chance to blend.  I only used 1 can of peas and that seemed like plenty.  I wonder how it would be to substitute green beans or something like that to make it less starchy.  I also was toying with the idea of using Cream of mushroom soup and milk instead of the tomato soup and water.  I just might try it next time.

I had been searching for this recipe.  It was one my step-mother used to make often when I was growing up and I always loved it.  She always made it with tomato soup and breakfast sausages and that's the way I like it best.  Thank you for taking me back to my childhood! :-)

Great recipe and helps me clean out the cupboards!  I just used what we had on hand.  Thinly sliced some red potatoes, cut baby carrots in half, instead of buttering the pan, I put some butter on top of the onions.  I didn't drain the canned peas and it turned out fine, the rice was perfect.  Browned ground turkey instead of the sausage.  Also I used cream of mushroom, like someone else mentioned, next time I may put an extra can in.  In short it was good!  I liked it a lot.  My husband said it was okay, but he tends to like things with a kick.  May try it in the crock pot next time.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is very similar to the recipe I use, except I too use ground beef instead of sausage. Also I cook the instant rice b4 I add it to the mix and grated potatos and onions work better for me.

Because my family are such picky eaters i switched this one up a bit.  I omitted the rice and the peas completely.  I layered potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, salt & pepper and then repeated the layering again.  I then put my sausages and used double the amount of tomato soup and water.  The family loved it!  I`ve made this several times since with smoked sausages, hotdogs, pork breakfast sausages.. all of them taste great with this recipe! Note though that if you do use simpler sausages such as breakfast or hotdog your potatoes should be fairly thin so as to cook through without burning your sausages.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  I added the two photos. Made the first one earlier today; pretty much to recipe.  Making another version that went in the oven the way the second photo appears.  I lined the pan with ground burger and then topped it with the potatoes, onions, French onion soup mix, and a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a can of milk.  Taking it out after an hour and removing the foil and putting it in for another 20 minutes or so, depending on how done it appears and then removing it and topping it with cheese and putting back in for another 15 minutes.

Hi I have not tried this recipe yet but know it will be great.  I phoned my sister a couple of weeks ago to ask her for our mom's recipe for what we called 7 layer casserol.  She couldn't find it and I was having trouble remembering.  I did make what I thought was close and it wasn't as good as my mom used to make.  This recipe is exactly the one she used to use and I am so happy to have found it again.  We lost our mom in 1981 and miss her every day. The reason I am so excited about this is my mom's name was Ruth.    So thank you Ruth for the recipe and the memory.  Sincerely Terry

I was raised on this hearty recipe, which my mother pulled out on especially chilly evenings. Your version is the closest to what I recall, and I use it often. Delicious and economical, too..!

I will rate this later. It is still in the oven. I followed the directions except I used 1 15 oz. can of peas. For meat I used smoked sausage, all ready prepared little sausage pellets, and left over chicken which I boiled and cut up. I put butter on a couple of layers. All I had for tomatoe soup was the kind you don't add water to...Campbell's Creamy Basil. I added about a cup and a half of cheddar cheese and then added the soup. Smells good. We will soon see.

Made according to directions except that I used frozen peas instead of canned (I dislike the taste of canned peas, but love frozen).

Strictly mediocre all the way.  I was thoroughly unimpressed.

Needs plenty of salt.  I recommend at least 1 tbs of salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.  I mixed the soup, water, salt and pepper in a separate bowl before adding so that the salt and pepper were evenly distributed.

My husband and I made this. We shredded the potatoes and used match stick carrots. It turned out great. It needed a little salt, but that is because we forgot to salt the potatoes (very important). It was very filling and everyone enjoyed it. We'll try throwing in some different vegetables next time. Corn would go well. Maybe broccoli cut up into small chunks so kids don't recognize it as broccoli. We also put cheese on top. Very yummy.

Everyone loved this. I used the food processor to slice everything and it was super fast to assemble. Made a bunch fir the freezer - The first one came out with some undercooked rice - next time I will add more liquid, cook the rice first, or leave it out. Reminds me of tinfoil pouch dinners when camping!l

Really enjoyed this!  Same ingredients but added can of mushrooms and a dusting of sage and garlic powder when assembled.  I partially browned the sausage, still a little pink, and drained on paper towels to reduce the fat.  Also had to be away from home a couple of hours so baked covered casserole on 275 degrees for 2 hrs.  Probably will slice potatoes and carrots a little thicker next time but rice was perfect.  May also use frozen stir fry veggies as a variation.  Can you say, "Pot Luck Dish"?

Very similar to the seven layer hotdish I loved growing up.  Skipped the peas and rice, I sometimes do a quick boil of onions, peppers, and celery which seems to release the flavors faster... Put in a spicy ground pork sausage to kick up the flavor.  Glad to add this back into my recipe foldEr

This was just okay; definitely a hearty meal but I found it very bland, even after seasoning each layer and browning the meat with herbs and red wine.

A few months ago I made a similar recipe with cream of mushroom instead of condensed tomato and I wasn't impressed.  Well, the condensed tomato (and rice) really make a difference.  The recipe didn't mention whether or not to pre-cook the meat so I went ahead and pre-cooked it.  Well, my meat was overly brown so I have a strong suspicion you are supposed to use raw meat.  Which just makes it even easier.  I really only had 5 ingredients: potatoes, canned lima beans, rice, tomato soup, and ground beef.  I will definitely make this again.  I can't wait to try it with frozen carrots and onion.  I think I will keep the canned lima beans.  How easy is it to plop all these ingredients into a dish and pop in the oven?  All you need is time.

I was excited to find this recipe. It was one of my favorites growing up. I had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand, but it all worked out. I used hamburger instead of sausage and green beans instead of peas.  It was still very good.  I would like to try cream of chicken soup next time.  Great basic recipe that can have endless possibilities.

Grew up eating this in Nova Scotia, it's the real deal! I just usually use frozen peas. I was so happy to find the recipe. The kids will eat it too :)

My mom used to make this often when I was a kid... she did not use any soup though she does now.. very simple .. you might call it plain but I love the simple down to earth flavors.. I have one in the oven now! potatoes, carrots, onions, green peas, rice and raw ground beef. salt and pepper to taste.. delicious!

It's easy to make, and makes a lot of servings, so it's great for weeknight dinner for a large family.  It's not very exciting though, as you can see, it's so simple and one dimensional.  You might like to add different kind of herbs, spices, or even different kind of sauces.
