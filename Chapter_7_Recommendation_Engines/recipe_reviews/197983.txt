I followed the recipe to the letter, and its pretty good, but lacking something... Next time I make it I believe I will up the spices, since  I think it will give the flavor a little more punch.

I made this for a light snack for me during the week. I did use my own air popped corn and instead of all parmesan cheese, I used half nutritional yeast and I used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola/vegetable oil. I did use CALIFORNIA chili powder as you get the flavor and a little bite and not a ton of heat. SUPER yummy. Be sure if you're like me and like to snack and really stink at portion control, that you use a measuring cup and divide this mix into individual snack bags so you don't overdo it.

I made this for the Superbowl - really good!! I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder, because I like things salty. Very easy recipe- and I will definitely make this again!

I love spicy and I love garlic.  This recipe was not as spicy as I would have liked.  If I make it again, I will probably up all the spices.  Also, I have tried several of the other gluten-free chex mix  recipes here and I prefer the consistently of the mix when it is baked and has ingredients that cause the spices to stick.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I did have to add more oil (we use olive oil) though, as the 3 TB the recipe calls for just wasn't enough.  Also, I think I'll add more seasoning next time as it's not quite as flavorful as I'd like.  But, overall, it's a *great* recipe and we're enjoying this as our t.v. snack.  Thanks for sharing!

I took this to a neighborhood party and no one knew it was gluten free.  My biggest problem was keeping my family's fingers out of it before the party.

Easy enough, but lacking a little in flavor.  I added more spices to liven it up a bit.
