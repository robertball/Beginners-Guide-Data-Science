I have made at least 6 enchilada sauce recipes off this site, even the scratch boil-the-chiles-put-in-blender-strain-etc. This one is not only the easiest, but it's the best. I've made it dozens of times with only a few minor adjustments. At times I use a mixture of New Mexico and Calif chile powders. If I'm out of one, I'll use the other. Both have the best flavor for enchiladas. There doesn't seem to be a reason to use self-rising flour, so I use regular. If I have chicken broth on hand, I use that as a substite for the water. Same with fresh garlic. I add about an ounce or two of dark chocolate to the mix for a bit more depth in flavor. You can't taste the chocolate, but it does add something. 

I dip my corn tortillas in the sauce while the sauce is still pretty hot. I also pour sauce in the bottom of the baking dish before I place the rolled up enchiladas in. Don't worry if your sauce seems too thin; it thickens in the oven.  

Don't bother with any other sauce recipes on this site. Take my word for it, this one is the best.

P.S. The best New Mexico chile powder is the 69 cent "Chile New Mexico Molido" in the red, white, and green package by the company "Mexico Spices Corp"

I hate to give this three stars but I hate it when people rate recipes by the changes they have made.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce had way too strong of a chili powder flavor to it, I nearly gaged. So I added more garlic pwd, cumin and onion pwd, it ended up tasting pretty good. However next time I will try 3 TBSP chili pwd and double the rest of the spices. I hope this helps someone! Revised: 04-1-08 I made this again and doubled the spices and only used two TBSP of chili powder it was much better, not perfect but much better.

my family loved this!  I had to make some changes though.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I blended up a 14 ounce can of tomatoes and juice and used all of it.  It sounded like a whole lot of chile pwdr., and I had no idea what the diffference between New Mexico or Calif chile pwdr., but used what I had and it was great.  I started out using half the amount of chile pwdr. called for just in case and found I needed the entire amount called for.  When it was done, the sauce was a little bland for my taste, so I upped the amount of garlic, onion, cumin to 3/4 tsp.  It was then great!  To this sauce, I added boiled, shredded chicken, (3 boneless skinless chicken breasts) and 2 cans (4 ounce) green chiles.  WOW!!!!   Now we have a very versatile dish!  Use for tacos, enchiladas, salad, nachos-you can't go wrong and I think the end product was a 5 star!  Use your discretion at upping the amount of spice according to your own taste.

I have made this recipe for about a year. It got much better once I reduced the amount of water! It makes a creamy heartier sauce. 1 cup water max, trust me.

This recipe is great, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used plain flour, used only half the chili powder and it was fantastico.  I also added 1 clove crushed garlic during the browning of the flour and 1 teaspoon of cumin with the chili powder. Deliciouso!

The problem with a 10 minute sauce is that it lacks the depth of flavor - which I think is needed in a really good enchilada sauce.  I just made a small batch to see what I thought before making a large batch for our family dinner tomorrow. It tastes like tomato sauce and chili powder.  I followed the recipe to a T.   Living in Southern California avails you to many authentic mexican restaurants. It didn't taste bad, but it certainly isn't what I consider enchilada sauce.

This was so easy and yummy! Tasted like the sauce in the restaurants! I didn’t have self-rising flour so I used regular flour and added a tablespoon of cornstarch once it was bubbling to thicken it up. I will never buy the packaged sauce again!

Very nice taste / texture. I would give it 4 stars but my wife & kids give it 5+, so 5 it is!  I think the 'servings' is per enchilada, so for your average 9x13" pan of enchilads you will need to double the recipe. We will use this again & again.

I also prefer the New Mexico chili powder for this recipe. And I don't see why enchilada sauce requires a leavening agent (I never have self-rising flour on hand anyway)  so I just go with the Wondra flour and decrease the water by 1/4 cup. I also like my garlic, so I double the amount, using granulated, and sometimes I'll add a pinch of cinnamon just for fun. This recipe has replaced the canned stuff in our house. Thank you, Brandi T.
Great photo, Linda! :)

I have made this twice now while making beef enchiladas (corn tortillas, cheese, etc). The first time, I made the recipe as is.  It was definitely superior than canned versions I have used!  The second time I made it, I added 1/4 tsp of cocoa and substituted the water with chicken broth.  WOW!!!  Though the original recipe is good enough for a high rating, those changes rocketed it to amazing. So much depth of flavor! Husband said they were the best enchiladas he's ever had, and given the many amazing mexican and tex-mex restaurants around us, that's a great compliment to the original recipe and the updated version.

Very good enchilada sauce & I would definitely make it again over buying canned.  I used regular all-purpose flour; also used chipotle chili  powder and it was really too hot; I had to tone it down with more tomato sauce, but it turned out to be very good.  Subbed the 1.5c water with 1c chicken broth for better flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Brandi!

I made this last night to put on top of some enchiladas made with homemade tortillas with leftover veggie and meat filling inside. It was delicious! For those who gave it a bad review because of the flour-y taste, the recipe directions state that you should make a roux (pronounced roo) from the oil, flour, and chile powder. This means that you combine those 3 things in a pan with a whisk and let it cook, stirring occasionally, until it is very bubbly and has browned slightly. Then, whisking furiously, you add the rest of the spices and the liquids. This cooks the flour and chile powder first to get rid of that gross floury taste. I followed this recipe to a T, and it was just perfect. I'd definitely make it again.

This is a good enchilada sauce, but the directions have a mistake. Step one has you adding the chili powder with the flour and oil, but it shouldn't be added until the flour has lightly browned.

I think the reviews all depend on what part of the country you are in.  North and Midwestern's may think it's too strong.  Cali folks have their own style just as we have TexMex here in Texas.  

This sauce is fine as a quick sauce.  I did change the order of adding ingredients.  I bloomed ALL of the spices in the oil (I used sunflower oil because it is what I had), then added the flour(I did use white wheat flour).  You have to be VERY careful not to burn the roux.  It is harder to tell the color of the roux because of the spices.  If you even get it a little too brown the sauce will taste BAD and it goes from perfect to BAD in a short time.

The infusion of the spices into the oil is what brings out the depth of flavor (and of course the lightly browned flour).  Skip this step and you will have flat sauce.  Instead of the plain tomato sauce, you may want to try a fire roasted or Rotel canned tomato, throw it in the blender...blend into sauce consistency.  

I had to add about 1/2 tsp salt for my taste.  After I tasted the recipe, I decided to add 3/4 tsp of sugar to it, too - personal preference.

As a native New Mexican, it is law to have a second blender used solely to blend and make the red chile sauce every year (with roasted chiles, water and spices, no tomatoes). The chiles dye the blender dark red-black.    I found that Old El Paso enchilada sauce tastes great and use that instead of slaving away every year.  I felt guilty but every one raves about my enchiladas.  One day I was driving down a county road in Gadsden County, the county that produces all the chile in NM (chile capital of the world) and drove by a huge factory labeled "Old El Paso" on the side. No wonder it taste  great. Made with fresh Hatch chiles in the high dry desert climate of New Mexico.  My review will probably be dropped...but anything that saves time and energy.

My store stopped carrying the brand of suace i usually use, so i made a recipe simmerlier to this, it was pretty darn good but I thought i would try to find something better. This was exellent enchilada sauce, I did add a few squares of hershys choc, and simmered on low for about 20 minutes just to let the spices combine together(Just like i did with my recipe). I actually doubled the recipe and made spanish rice to go along with the enchiladas. Overall a good sauce, very simmilar to what I had already made, so I think next time i will just combine the recipes and see how it turns out. Once you try this though you will never buy canned agian.   Also for those who had a prob with 10 min sauce, simmer it longer, that should fix the prob. Also if you want to make it a day or two ahead of time, that will really let the spices blend together.  Update- the more I make this the better it turns out. I have tried with different types of chili powder and from my experience you need a good chili powder, the cheap stuff just wont do. I have also simmered it for at least 20 minutes.  I still add a few squares of chocolate and add some more garlic and cumin. It is very important to get the oil/flour/chili powder mixture right in order for this sauce to turn out.  *To the reviewer who took the chili powder out... Umm that is what makes it ENCHILADA SAUCE!

Wow! Followed the recipe and used two other reviewers' advice to add a tiny pinch of cinnamon and about 2 ounces of dark chocolate. Man oh Man! This stuff is so tasty and the flavor has true depth to it. Thank you so much for such an easy recipe. Why have I been buying the canned stuff all these years!?

I never made enchilada sauce before and was skeptical that this recipe would turn out okay.  I followed the directions exactly and was really pleased with the results.  I bought a roast chicken from the grocery store, cubed it, mixed some of the sauce and some grated monterey jack cheese, then rolled the tortillas in this mixture.  I placed them in a 9X14 pan and poured the sauce over and some more grated cheese and heated it in the over for half an hour.  The result was spectacular, no leftovers.  The only thing I would do in the future is double the recipe if you use a large pan like I did, there just wasn't enough sauce.

Excellent. Be sure to NOT use the run-of-the-mill chili powder, it'll ruin it. I used New Mexico Chili Powder, fresh garlic (sauteed with the flour), and some cayenne for a little kick. Superior to the canned stuff, by far.

Easy and tasty!  This will spice up depending on what kind of Chili Powder you use.  Double the recipe if you are using a 9x13 baking dish.  Probably won't be buying the pre made stuff anymore!  :-)

Huddy has an intollerance to HFCS also every suace (mexican or other ) has it in it.  Making it on my own was the healthy choice for us.  I never thought it would be this easy.  I made in on for easy enchiladas from this site.  Thanks for sharing!

This is good & easy. The first time I made it, I burned the flour/chili powder mix and it wasn't so great. The second time, I didn't cook that step very long at all and it came out perfectly. I suggest having your water & tomato sauce measured & ready before you start so if the flour starts to burn you're prepared to douse it. I just used regular chili powder from the grocery store- it doesn't say where it's from but it worked fine.

I am so glad I found this recipe!!  My go-to enchilada recipe is "Angela's Awesome Enchiladas" from this site.  The enchiladas are delicious but I was very disappointed twice by two different store-bought enchilada sauce.  The first had a not-so-good flavor and the second was very runny.  This sauce is AWESOME!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I made a double batch and doubled every ingredient except the chili powder.  I couldn't find New Mexico or California chili powder so I just used the stuff I had on hand.  I also just used regular AP flour and added 1 chicken bouillon cube to the water as suggested by some other reviewers.  I will DEFINITELY make this sauce from now on when I make enchiladas, no more store bought sauce for me!!

I just made this sauce and actually can't wait to try it once it's sat overnight.  I too doubled the garlic, used regular flour and added approx 1 tsp of sugar to this recipe. Love how easy it is to make!  Hubby loves it! Thanks for posting!

Wow this tasted like straight up chili powder. I am sorry I have never given only 1 star before. I even used half of the amount in the recipe. Sorry I wasted the supplies to make this. Sticking to the canned stuff.

Have to give this 5 stars, I was a little skeptical if it would be any good but, surprise it was perfect and quick to boot. I used it to make beef and bean burritos and it was perfect without all the extra chemicals from a canned enchilada sauce. I did cut the water down to one cup and I added half a cube of beef boullion. After adding the cup of water, it looked like the perfect consistency, I know enchilada sauce is pretty thin. thanks, for a helpful recipe.

Ten minutes and ten times as delicious as any sauce from a can. This was so easy and quick! I threw a Mexican cuisine dinner party and knew when I saw this recipe, Enchiladas would be my main course. I doubled the batch and poured a little on the bottom of my pan covered the bottom with corn tortillas rolled and filled with shredded chicken, mexican cheese, cumin and chile powder. Topped with the rest of the sauce and more cheese. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes and it was perfect. The whole group devoured it. I thank the sauce, it really made all the difference!

I'm an experienced cook, but using the spices I had on hand, it turned out really awful. I buy them in the organic bulk section of a nutrition center, but it's still hard to know how fresh those spices are. So, I rushed out to the grocery store,  made it again, and found the key is using the recommended Chile New Mexico Molido spice and fresh garlic and onion. I found 2-1/2 Tblsp of chili pwdr was plenty, bumped up the cumin and added oregano and garlic salt. It turned out way better with a fresher taste. I didn't give it a five, because I found a reasonably priced canned sauce without additives that tastes very similar to this recipe, and there is no way to make this taste fresh in ten minutes. Flavors have to blend, especially dry spices, so I simmered for 15-20 min. tasting along the way, then let it sit for 10 min. This is a fine base recipe to tweak to your own taste, but use fresh ingredients whenever possible.

This was great! I wanted to make enchilada's for dinner & realized I forgot to buy enchilada sauce so found this recipe & decided to try making it myself! It was great, just as good as from the store! I didn't have tomato sauce so instead used pizza sauce which was the closest thing I had (hey pizza sauce, tomato sauce its close enough!) I was nervous it would taste funny but my husband & I couldn't even tell! Also only had about 1/8th of a cup of chili powder left so just used that. Great recipe, I might make my own sauce from now on :-)

This recipe is exactly like the one I was raised on, except for one thing which I thinks makes a world of difference. substitute a can of chicken broth instead of the water and then thicken to desired consistency with corn starch. It's a hit every time. We use it on everything from enchilda's to scrambled eggs.

Great with many of the changes listed by other reviewers.  Very easy and good.  I sauteed an onion in olive oil, reduced chili powder to 2T, replaced water with chicken broth and added a small amount of bittersweet chocolate.  GREAT  Addition:  When out of tomato sauce and paste, I used canned diced tomatoes, once it was all together I put in food processor.  The consistency, thickness and flavor are perfect without the 10 - 20 minute cooking!

This is the best enchilada sauce!  Tried others from this site, not as good or easy as this.  I made two batches at once--one with New Mexico chile powder, one with California chile powder.  Both were equally good and brought its own element to the sauce, but when I tried a 50/50 mix, WOW!  That is the way to go!  Double the recipe, and use a 50/50 mix of New Mexico and California chile powder!  Also I used chicken stock instead of water for more flavor.

Okay Folks, let me tell you that this absolutely the best enchilada sauce I've ever made!  I have lived here in El Paso for over 20 yrs.  This area is known for excellant mexican cuisine, and this recipe is the best of the best!  I've spent years, toasting, roasting, soaking and blending all my fresh ingredients, only to obtain a sauce that was good, but far inferior to this one!  And it really did only take 10 mins.  Add 2 tsp Knorr chicken/tomato powder to soften the chile powder and that's the only change. This is now my secret sauce recipe. (The folks down here would never believe it!)  Don't limit this to using for just enchiladas.  It would also be great for making Chile Colorado, or add a little bittersweet chocolate for a good Chicken Mole!  Very authentic recipe!
P.S. If using regular flour, add 1/4 tps baking soda and a pinch of salt for the self-rising flour.  IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT  USE REGULAR CHILI POWDER, USE A GROUND RED CHILE POWDER, IE; NEW MEXICO RED ETC.  IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERECE IN THE RESULTING FLAVOR!

I AM SHOCKED - I never thought I could have restaurant quality enchilada sauce at home!  It was  OUTSTANDING!  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and substituted chicken broth in lieu of water and I added a couple of squares of dark chocolate (about 1/4 of a regular Dove candy bar).  Also, I have Celiac, so I used Gluten Free flour and it turned out great!

This is pretty good and very simple. I followed what previous reviewers said and halved the chili powder (I just used whatever kind I had) and doubled the spices.  I used olive oil and AP flour and added a little extra powder chicken broth and about a 1/2 cup of extra water.  We are spicy hot wimps, so to me with all those changes made, it was good, but still a bit spicy.  My 3 year old didn't like it, but my 18 month old loved it.  Hubby ate it, which is good.  Overall I will definitely make it again.  We are not big enchilada eaters and this was a fantastically quick recipe that used all ingredients that I have on hand normally.  Definitely try this!

If only I'd read the reviews beforehand.  I too, thought 1/4 cup chili powder was excessive but against my better judgement I followed the recipe exactly.  I wound up with a chili powder mess. What a disappointment.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Upon tasting it, I went back to sniff-test each of my spices to make sure nothing had gone bad.  All were ok.  This recipe definitely needs the improvements suggested in the ratings. After I added a bit more cumin, a tablespoon of chicken bouillon, and a small handful of chocolate chips (I had no dark baker's chocolate) the flavor just jumped off the spoon. It was a bit salty with the bouillon added in, so next time I will eliminate the salt altogether.  Once it was "doctored up" as my mother says, I would give it 5 stars. Thanks to Brandi T for starting the whole idea.

Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with chili powder flavored oil. Tried to save it by adding a tomato base but in the end had to throw it out.

AWFUL!!!  I gave it 1 star only because I couldn't give ZERO stars!  WAY too much chili powder!  1/4 cup is WAY too much, should have only been 1 tablespoon at the MOST!  DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!  Or if you do, cut the chili powder WAY down!

I haven't made enchiladas for awhile.  My Mexican sister in law makes great enchiladas and gets her chili seasoning from Colorado.  I could never get my enchiladas to taste like hers.  I happened to have a package of corn tortillas in the fridge and thought to make enchiladas but was hesitant cause I am not very successful with them but decided to give it a try on my own but didn't have any sauce until I found this recipe and it turned out great.  I used regular flour though and less oil and it was still good.  Will use this recipe.  Thank You!

Quick and easy! Will never buy canned sauce again. One tablespoon of chili powder was plenty for a mild sauce. Don't worry that the oil, chili powder and flour rue seems thin -- it thickens up just fine.  I added more salt and cumin to taste and a dash of unsweetened cocoa powder to bring out the spices.  Made these easy cheese enchiladas:  warm 8 corn tortillas in microwave.  Dip each tortilla fully in sauce, then fill with shredded sharp cheddar and a few canned chopped green chilis. Roll and arrange seam side down in baking dish. Top with more sauce, cheese and chopped green onions. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes until bubbly.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it gave me a wonderful base to work with! I know it upsets people when we rate things 5 star only after we altered them, but again, if it weren't for the base, I wouldn't have had anything. My changes: 1 cup of chicken bullion ( I make my own and it is a bit strong) this prompts the change to onion powder( not salt) double the amount. Double the cumin, double the garlic. Now the interesting thing, I had to use regular chili powder. ( ya, I'm in a place that doesn't have a wide variety of spices) to make up for that I thoroughly blended a can of mild Rotel. I then added about a quarter of that. You could add more if you want. It came out great! My husband hates the taste of regular chili powder in anything other than chili. He didn't even know it was in there!

This was okay. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time, I made changes that improved it, in my opinion. I used 2 tbs. cheapo chili powder and 2 tbs ancho chili powder (which is actually much better than what is originally called for). I skipped the tomato sauce and used a 6-oz can of tomato paste with 1 1/2 c. broth. I doubled the ground cumin, skipped the onion salt (I hate salt) and used double the amount of onion powder and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. To cut back on the fat, I used 2 tbs olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I skipped the self-rising (it won't be any more fluffier) and used 4 tsp of all purpose flour. Oh, and I threw in a hint of oregano, just because I could. Yep, definite improvement.

I thought this was perfect. I did use chicken broth like others said. And I put in less chili powder because I don't like it too hot. EASY and delicious!

Perfect red sauce for beef enchiladas.  The only thing I added was a beef boullion cube to the water and I used season salt for the regular salt.  Just delicious.  Exactly what we were looking for.  So much more economical than canned and much better taste.  I changed the servings to 24 for a family size batch for Christmas.

A very fine base sauce, but needs a little tweaking;

why use garlic powder and onion salt, when you can just add fresh minced garlic, finely chopped onions, and then salt to taste?

adding a bit of dark chocolate as mentioned by at least one other reviewer will add a bit more depth that may be lacking in a 10-minute sauce.

chili powder is chili powder, so find one that works for you and roll with it...

I whipped this up for the first time just now, and am quite pleased with the results. Beats canned ANY day. 

Also remember to dip the corn tortillas in the sauce before trying to roll them up, otherwise they'll crack and break, making a frustrating mess...

This was delicious... after quite a few modifications. The ingredient list is a great starting point, but I tweaked the quantities significantly. I began with a 15oz (nearly double recommended) can of tomato sauce as the recipe doesn't yield enough sauce to serve six people well-sauced enchiladas. I used double oil and flour, but kept my New Mexico chili (.69 @ Ralph's) constant at 1/4 cup. I used only 2 c of water. Roughly quadrupled all spices (except salt) and added about a tsp of cocoa powder until the flavor was deeper and more reminiscent of my favorite Mexican restaurant. I simmered the sauce for closer to 20 mins, stirring every couple mins and eventually came out with a nice sauce. Leftovers tasted good too-- sauce holds up well!

Very simple to make. Made per instructions and found the flavor much too strong. So I doubled the tomato sauce. Still had way too much chili powder and completely overpowered the chicken enchiladas I made with it.  Because it's so easy I'll try again using only 1-2 tbs chili powder.  Note: I think it would work very well to season meat for tacos, perhaps 1/4 cup sauce for a pound of meat, more if using beef.

My family did not like this at all. We make corn tortilla enchiladas about once a week, so I thought I would give this a try. Way too much chili powder and not enough flavor. I will not be making this again.

I thought this was a really good recipe!  I used The New Mexico Chili Powder as recommended, 1 cup of water, doubled the spices, halved the chili powder, and used 2 T of my gluten free flour blend.  This was perfect since I have a really hard time finding a gluten free enchilada sauce, and was so fast and easy!

This was a pretty good quick-fix if you need some sauce pronto.  The flour kind of weirded me out, but I think it worked in the end.  The sauce was kind of bland--even my kids needed to add extra hot sauce at the table.

This recipe turned out great!  Even better than store bought.  I did substitute chicken broth for water but kept everything else the same.  I may actually add just a little more broth next time because it was slightly thicker than I wanted.  Great smoky flavor with just the right spice.  Thanks for posting!

Absolutely delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and added chocolate. I thought it was very strange but it truly made the sauce perfect. Canned enchilada sauce is terrible and this sauce takes literally 10 minutes!! Thanks!

I live 8 miles from a grocery store & wanted to make tamale Pie for supper.  No enchilada sauce on hand, so went to AllRecipes &, as usual, got help.  Wonderful sauce & to add more home cooked flavor depth, I always substitute chicken, beef or veg. broth in place of water.  Thanks for sharing.  Merry Christmas ALL!

This basic recipe was very bland to me, tasted like tomato sauce. I increased cumin until I could taste it (probably about a tablespoon), increased onion/garlic to 1/2 - 1 teaspoon, added 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, cayenne until I had some heat, and about 1/2 - 1/3 teaspoon ground oregano. With these tweaks it was OUT OF THE PARK. I'd have used Mexican oregano but had none on hand.

OMG this is my go-to enchilada sauce! I've abandoned my mom's time-consuming blender process for this SUPER FAST, SUPER YUM recipe. It is the BEST! I use butter instead of oil, and instead of water I use a 15-oz can of beef broth. But FIVE STARS for a fantastic enchilada sauce! This is the only enchilada sauce I make anymore. Thank you!

I don't know if I did something wrong but this came out awful! It was horribly bitter (and I didn't burn anything). We had to add brown sugar, more of all the spices other than the chili powder, chicken broth ,and more tomato sauce to get rid of the bitterness.

Okay, I ended up with a pretty good enchilada sauce but I had to make some big modifications at the end to get there. At first I followed the recipe pretty much as written (the only sub I made was per another reviewer who recommended New Mexico or California Chile powder, and I had both so I went half and half.) I ended up with a very bitter tasting and way too thick mess.

So, I added the following ingredients at the end to help thin it a bit and mellow it out... 1 tbsp sugar, another can of tomato sauce and about another cup and a half of water. I cooked that for awhile on a low simmer and the sauce mellowed into something with a little kick, a good flavor, and the right "saucy" consistency.

WOW!!!  This is absolutely fabulous!!!  I have finally found an enchilada sauce recipe and it will be my staple forever.  I have had trouble in the past with enchilada sauce recipes, finding them to taste too much like pasta sauce, or too Italian-tasting.  This one is quick, easy, tasty and rich.  I used half the amount of chili powder called for (2 tbsp), for fear of it being too spicy because my chili powder said "Hot Mexican Chili Powder".  It could have been hotter so I think next time I will use 3 tbsp instead of the 4 called for, but that is just my chili powder.  This is the best enchilada sauce recipe ever and has ended my seemingly endless quest.

This was really good!  I started off by cooking a bit of onion in the oil and cooked it a little bit longer than 10 min...it was SO good.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Oh, also I just had regular old chili powder and that worked out just fine.  I reduced the chili powder by half (per other reviews) and it was perfect!

A couple revisions, I added fresh garlic and onion at the beginning. I only used 1/8 cup of chili powder because we like it more mild and that was plenty spicy for us. I also added about 2 tbsp of melted dark chocolate. You can't taste it but it gives the sauce a darker color and more depth to the flavor. It turned out fabulous!

This sauce is perfect if you tweak the amounts of chili powder and water.  I usually do 2-3 tbsp chili powder (depending on the heat of what I've got in the cupboard at the moment).  1/2 a cup of water is plenty in my opinion too.

I did not have tomato sauce so used tomato paste. Ended up not using the flour to thicken it, came out pretty thick anyway. Did have to add quite a bit of salt. But otherwise very good.

As the recipe stands I'll give it 3 stars...but with some improvements it could be 5 stars!!!  Reduce the chili powder (ALL you could taste was chili powder) by at least half and increase the other seasonings according to taste--anywhere from 3/4 tsp. to 1 tsp.  
Another reviewer suggested reducing the water but I would discourage that.  Even with 1 1/2 c. water this sauce was fairly thick and became even more thick as it cooked in the oven.  
My husband RAVED about this sauce and declared that every Sunday should be Enchilada Day--and all thanks to the sauce!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I felt like it needed a touch of sweetness after it was made, so I added a little bit of ketchup and a little honey. It made the right amount of sauce for my usual enchilada pan, and I will definitely make it again.

So we tried it again, and I had to update my review... decreased the chili powder to 1 Tbs, and added chicken broth when it was simmering. Simmered for 30 minutes, and it was wonderful this time! Last time it was too hot!

Super easy and really tasty! I used regular flour, added fresh garlic (in addition to the garlic powder), used vegetable broth instead of plain water, and doubled all the spices. Additionally, I added about a third of a small can of jalapenos and about an ounce of chocolate (slightly mole style!) This turned out great - with lots of flavor and just the right amount of heat. Thanks!

This recipe had more of an empty heat...It didn't thrill my tastebuds-it seemed to me to be a bit too much spice but my husband liked it. Didn't love it but liked it.

I`m basing my review on the revisions I made: cut chili powder in half, and tripled the cumin, garlic powder, and onion salt.  I also used regular flour.  Quick and easy!

This sauce was very easy and excellent. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I just used pasta sauce and it still worked out really well!  Will make again.

Excellent base recipe for enchilada sauce.  SO much better than canned!  I added chicken boullion to enhance the flavor and I'm sure I'll find all sorts of other ways to play with this recipe in the future.  Thanks!  

***A note to other recipe followers- New Mexico Chile Powder is VERY mild and really has no heat, so don't be afraid to use the full amount.  I used regular chile powder the other day because I was out of New Mexico and it was spicier and not as good.***

Wow, great recipe!  I made this twice...the first time I stuck to the recipe as it was submitted but found it WAY too spicy and liquidy so I threw that out and tried again.  This time I used 2 T of chili powder and reduced the water to a little over three quarters of a cup for a thicker sauce.  It was perfect!  I will be using this recipe many times!  Thanks!

This is yummy.  No more packages for me.  I used some chicken broth in place of water, a little less water, a little less chili powder, and I added some regular black pepper to taste.  Great!

Simple, but incredible!  We loved this recipe.  
  I would recommend doubling it if you are making it for a pan of enchiladas.  You may even want to triple it if you like yours saucy.

NICE!!!! To make it a lighter I omited the oil and browned the flour & chili powder in a dry pan. Adding a little more water to get that perfect consistancy. This one is well worth trying.:)

LOVED THIS! Huge hit with my family. I did make a couple of changes. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the recipe since we made about 12-14 enchiladas. We don't like our food to be too spicy so I put in less than a 1/4 cup of chili powder even though I doubled the recipe.I also put in a whole can of beef broth instead of water. I also used one whole can of tomato sauce plus a whole can of rotel cilantro tomatoes. I let the whole thing simmer for about 20 to 30 min. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I can't comment on if it is authentic or not but we loved this recipe. We will make this again.

I made this recipe as written and it was not good. Maybe I used too much chili powder?  Way too spicy and bland.  Maybe I cooked the flour mixture too long?  Not sure. So I gave it another try. I used 2T of chili powder instead and 2 8oz cans tomato sauce. Much better!

We decided to make enchiladas today for Cinco de Mayo but didn't have the sauce, so I decided to look it up on AR and so glad that I did.  This recipe is very easy and so good that it has been declared that we will not buy canned sauce again!  I doubled the recipe and used half regular chili powder and (since we like things hot & spicy) half adobo seasoning with a dash of cayenne.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Can't wait for the enchiladas to come out of the oven and taste the final entree since the sauce was so tasty by itself!!!

made this last night to rave reviews. I used regular chili powder since it was what I had on hand.  The flavor and thickness of the sauce would rival any good Tex-Mex restaurant.  fast, easy, made with pantry staples absolutely delish!!

In the oven I roasted 3 poblano peppers (peel the charred skin off) and added them and the prepared sauce in the blender to puree.  Fantastic!
To the sauce I added some minced onion and season all, used real garlic vs. powder, and was heavy on the cumin.

Okay the only reason I rated this a 1 is because the sauce was totally off... I end up using 4 29oz cans of tomatoe sauce and that was perfect... 1/4 cup of powder to one 8oz can in insane, even my mexican friends said it was wrong!!! But with the changes it was good and added about 1 TB of the rest of the spices!! PERFECT with the changes!!!

I would like to add a minor edit to my original review from 2006. A year or so ago I discovered a fantastic chili powder and have been using it in the sauce. It's Ground Ancho Chili Pepper from Chef's Paradise and it's at Surfa's Culver City, $7. The ground Ancho Chili Pepper powder is mild and sweet and I like it better than any other chili powder.

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe. I followed it to a T, and if I compare it to a jar of your average everyday enchilada sauce in a mid-western grocery store- I think it's excellent. Remember- your food will only be as good as the quality of your ingredients (especially the spices you use).

Four stars as it was good, but not exceptional. Per the other reviewers, I cut down on the amount of chili powder and oil to 3 Tbsp, and upped the cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder to 1/2 tsp. I substituted onion powder for the onion salt, so that I could have more control of the salt. I also let this simmer longer to give it more depth of flavor. 

I'll probably make this again, using more than one variety of chili powder, as it's a little one dimensional with only one type of chili.

Excellent!  My chili powder was too spicy, so I did 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of 1, and added 2 Tbl of ketchup to tone down the heat.  Won't be buying canned stuff again!

I personally did not feel like that was a good recipe. It was "authentic" tasting for simple ingredients, but the tomato sauce over powered the dish and gave it a bland taste if you didn't alter it. I had to change a lot of things and add a lot of extra seasoning in order for it to taste like anything other than tomato sauce. I added brown sugar to round out the flavor of the sauce, and personally I hate cumin so I did a tiny amount and could still taste it. I also used chicken stock instead of water and didn't add flour. I also added Cajun seasoning to give it some more heat and garlic powder to help with depth of flavor.

Made this last night with leftover rotisserie chicken and it was good. I too made some changes. Used about 1/2 the amount of chili powder. Doubled the cumin, garlic, and onion. Used 1 cup water with Chicken Better than Bouillon.  Also used AP flour.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn, like one of our local favorite restaurants.  Fast and easy.  I almost always make changes to recipes-my family doesn't like anything too spicy so I have to take that into consideration.

This sauce tasted like Ragu spaghetti sauce with chili powder.  Stayed with me all day and night.  First try, the oil sizzled when adding the chili powder, turning it black.  Yuck.  Tried again with lower heat- Ragu...

Love this sauce.  I leave out the heat and don't even cook it for the full time and it's still the most wonderful topping for enchiladas, burritos and insert other yummy Mexican favorites here.

This was great and so quick. I reduced the chilli powder to 2 T but made no other changes. I'm not sure why this calls for self rising flour but I used it anyway. I've frozen some for future use. Thankyou Brandi for something that was really good and so much cheaper than shop bought.

Excellent. I read other reviews and added fresh garlic and finely diced onions. I also added a tablespoon (about) of cocoa and it give it a really nice, rich color. You couldn't taste it, but it did add something. My son had a couple of friends over, all college age, and they devoured a 9x13 pan of chicken enchiladas in no time. Thank you for a great recipes! Immensely better than canned!!!!

Good base recipe.  I thought the chili powder to be a bit overwhelming and added some additional tomato sauce.  I agree with the other reviews about cutting the water back to 1 cup.  I also added some tabasco since it was not hot enough for my liking. Good overall.

I was browsing to see if my own recipe is here - this isn't it, but it's close.  I can offer a few tips on this, though.  My brother worked in a chile packing plant in Hatch, NM for a while. ("I quit when they put me on jalapenos!").  His advise is to never use chile powder because they grind up the whole chile - stems, seeds, branches, small animals (:

I love this recipe, and I've not bought sauce since stumbling upon it.  I always use my own chicken stock (because I usually am making chicken enchiladas and use the water that comes from boiling my chicken) and cut back a little on the flower as the recipe makes a sauce thicker than what I like.

I didn't like this sauce.  I think that maybe the type of chili powder you use might make a difference.  I upped the other spices and added a touch of cinnamon and oregano, but we still didn't like it.

Since I don't really have authentic enchilada sauce to compare with... from a gringo-asian standpoint this was delicious! I use this for all of my enchilada recipes. Yes, it's HOT. Good for my mom and me, bad for the sister and dad. Either turn down the chili powder or give your loved ones a glass of milk.

The perfect homemade enchilada sauce. I used the recipe exactly as stated, although I did simmer for 30 minutes on the stop. I made chicken enchiladas for dinner and everyone loved them. The sauce was a big hit. I will not buy the canned sauce ever again!

I have been told I make the best chicken enchiladas ever, and this sauce is probably the reason. I did change it just a little bit though. After it is done on the stove, I let it cool in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, then throw it in the blender with about 1 cup of sour cream. I also use HOT chilli powder. Adds an extra kick in the pants!

It's a good BASE recipe to start with.  With mine, I use the full amount of chile powder and add more cumin to it - that, to me, is the real flavor of enchilada sauce.  I also tripled this for a 9" x 13" pan plus a bit left over (great in egg, refried bean, and cheese burritos) and used 2 15oz. cans of tomato sauce and 2 cups water with the amount of oil and flour called for.  I like my sauce on the thicker side so I let it cook about 30 mins.  The real secret to full flavor in mine is that I added 1 packet (or 1 cube) of beef bouillon.  That's really what gave it great depth.

Adjusted as others have with less chili powder, and more of the other spices. I like it because it is quick, and not from a can, and the flavor is good - not out of this world, but a solid sauce.

This was wonderful!  I did substitute 2 cups of tomato juice for the water and tomato sauce.  As far as what kind of chili powder... ummm... store brand...  Still tasted wonderful.  My "picky-salsa-hating" daughter finally loved my chicken enchiladas!  Gets 5 stars and 2 thumbs up from me!!!!!

I had never made enchilada sauce before, this is by far SO much better than canned.  I cut the chili powder back to two tablespoons (personal preference), but other than that followed exactly. Thank you for posting this!  :-)

I've been using this for almost a year - we will never buy the canned stuff again!  Perfect as is!  Even better I got my husband to like making it, so I can chill at the counter with a glass of spanish wine while he cooks - doesn't get better than that!!

WAY too heavy on the chili powder!! It totally overpowered the taste of the enchiladas I put it on, and it made the sauce a bit gritty.

This enchilada sauce is GREAT! I used New Mexico chile powder and followed everything to a T. It really bothers me when people rate recipes but they changed everything on it. I did everything it said and it came out wonderful! My whole family loved it and i will definitely make this again.

OK, so as one reader mentioned, a true enchilada sauce does not contain tomato sauce, BUT......this recipe is outstanding!! It is so much better than the canned store bought kind!! I followed the recipe. just doubled it. Oh, and I also added a few chocolate chips to mellow the flavor. It was to die for!!! Thanks so much for this fast and wonderful recipe!!!

Came out good, but hello heartburn.  I switched to cooking my chicken in the slower cooker with 1 can of tomato sauce & 2 cups of water w/ seasonings.  Much milder but still has lots of flavor.  Also cut back on the chili powder.

I have gotta say, that this is THE BEST enchilada sauce recipe that I have ever tried and my family agrees. So much better than the canned and so easy to make. Use it with enchilada's made from the pork carnitas recipe at cooking-mexican-recipes.com/pork-carnitas.html and you won't want to have it any other way. Suggest that you have everything pre-measured though because things go pretty quickly once you start. 6 servings is definitely not enough for anything that I cook though, so triple it to be on the safe side and if you want to save some for later, make even more. I usually do 36 servings and put some away for next time.

I made this sauce to go with Angela's Awesome Enchilada's, and it was amazing!!  I was nervous b/c it called for 1/4 cup of chili powder, but that is what it needed.  The flour definitely helped it become a nice thickness, and the flavor was incredible.  I even used it on scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Thanks!

VERY easy and delish! I did add a little extra cumin and a tablespoon of taco seasoning but truly was good before the additions, just a personal taste for us. Used it on the BEEF ENCHILADAS II, very easy also! Great meal and Hubby said it was better than the truly Mexican restaurant here! He is still nimbling on it, everytime he walks in the kitchen! Keeper!

Very simple and good sauce. I have no idea what authentic enchilada sauce tastes like but this was good. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a few good squirts of a good tomato paste in 8 oz of water then I reduced the water the recipe calls for to 1 cup, could of made it less for a thicker sauce.

Iv tried many recipes on here and this by far was the biggest disappointment. I really had high hopes and followed the recipe to the letter...but it just came out awful. My husband who isn't a picky eater at all wouldn't eat it although he tried. I would not make this again.

Good start but you have to be careful not to burn chile powder or it will get bitter. I used all ingredients but added the chile powder and other spices after the flour had toasted for a few minutes. Toasting the dry spices brings out their flavor more. I will add double the cumin next time. I love cumin.

This is a great sauce.  Mine was darker than the recipe, I may have cooked the flour longer, but I was trying to make it the same so I added some ketchup. At any rate, as is, this is an excellent sauce.  Easy and delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Went to make enchiladas and didn't have any canned sauce, so I jumped on here. Boy am I glad I did. Used 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 1-1/2 cups chicken broth. Doubled garlic and onion powder. Added 1 Tbls ground chocolate like I used for espresso. Perfect!  No need to buy canned again.

This recipe is a killer! I couldn't keep my fingers out of the sauce.  I am glad I doubled the recipe to freeze some for later.  I added Lea & Perrins, dried oregano and a hint of cinnamon.  Also added more cumin, and fresh garlic instead of powdered...my sauce turned out dark and rich!

Great!  5 stars for ease and rich flavor.  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so substituted V8.  Thank you!

Truly delicious.  I bought fresh chili powder in bulk for this recipe.  Added a little cinnamon and a square of dark chocolate for richness.  Quick and easy; it made my first attempt at enchiladas a great success.  Thanks!

Fast and easy, that's what I like. I added some chipotle powder too, about a tsp. worth. Hubby thought this was plenty spicy. I didn't consider this hot on a spicy scale by any means, medium sweat as far as heat. I used this for some beef and onion enchiladas and it turned out a great dish! Thanks, I'll make this one again.

This is a really good recipe, especially if you are wanting to please lots of people. I would suggest adding a tbsp of cornstarch, mixed with a tbsp of water so it doesnt clump up in the sauce. Also DO NOT use 1/4 cup of powder. Its WAY too much. I used just 2 tbsp and it was perfectly spicy enough, without tasting like lots of chili powder. Also, if you have some, just add about 1 tbsp of taco seasoning. It helps it to taste more authentic and even better than the restuarants. I only gave 4 stars, because without my alterations, thats all that its really worth.

I have made this several times. It is so much healthier than they canned enchilada sauces, who wants to eat msg? I did add 1 square (.375 oz) of Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate 60% cacao to make it more authentic. yum!

I made chicken enchiladas using this sauce last night.  First of all, my husband RAVED about how delicious they were.  Now, I've made literally dozens of meals for my husband with recipes from this site, and last night, after he went to bed, he actually came back out and re-iterated at how fabulous I am for making enchiladas from scratch.  Though it may not be "authentic" as some people are saying, I must say - thank you, for a fabulous, super-easy, tastes-like-I-can-cook-Mexican-food sauce.  My adjustments:  I didn't have onion salt, so I doubled the garlic powder & it tasted fine.  Nor do I know the difference between chili powders, so I used regular old McCormick Chili Powder. I subbed whole wheat flour for the regular and chicken stock for the water.  Great stuff!

I made this sauce for the Chicken Enchilada  I on this site. I used self-raising flour but it is not necessary. I think regular flour will work better because the sauce seemed a little too thick. But it tasted great and complimented the enchiladas perfectly! I will definitely make this the default sauce to use all the time! Thank u for the awesome recipe!

After making enchiladas and realizing I did not have the can of sauce in the cupboard I thought I had... I went searching for a quick and easy enchilada sauce. I found this one and went with it. I will say, I am SO glad I didn't have my canned Enchilada sauce on hand, and I will never buy it again. This was SO good! I used Chicken Stock instead of water and only used a little over one cup of it. It made a nice, thick, hearty sauce. I also turned the Chili Powder down to two heaping Tablespoons and it was more than enough for our taste. I also used regular flour, came out perfect. The best enchiladas I have ever made...and I even got to boast that the enchilada sauce was "made from scratch", which always feels good:-) Excellent recipe!

Thank you for posting this recipe. I have been looking for a good sauce because the stuff in the can makes me gag. This was super easy to make and my husband loved it. He's mexican and he says it tastes better than his mom's 9who uses the can by the way). His  mom asked me for the recipe and then my sister in law wanted it too. Sauce goes good on the Tamales from Costco too.

What a truly tasty and easy recipe to make!  I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference was I couldn't find the New Mexico chile power (I live in the UK) so I used regular chili powder and it was still delicioso!!!  This is the sauce that I will make from now on!!!

This recipe is so easy, and it's nice to get that little ego boost when you tell people, "I even made the sauce myself" ;) I'll admit that before this, I only used canned sauce, and honestly never even thought about making my own. Then one day I was desperate for a dinner recipe and my available ingredients all added up to enchiladas...except for the lack of sauce. I went on a hunt for a sauce recipe, and luckily I stumbled across the right one the first time! I made a double batch because I only had a 15 oz. can of sauce, used regular flour, and regular McCormick chili powder since it was what I had on hand. Once it was all together I tasted it and thought it was missing a little something, so I added just a splash of lime juice (I like the tang). Other than that, I couldn't be happier! My husband isn't a huge fan of Tex Mex food, but even he said, "Wow, this is really good!" My sons (2 and 4) loved the enchiladas, too. What's really nice, though, is that by making a big batch, I put the extra sauce in a ziplock bag in the freezer for another quick meal. I used the frozen batch yesterday, and it's just as good as when I made it. In the future I'll make a really big batch and freeze it in individual portions, since enchiladas are a new family favorite thanks to this sauce!

Was the perfect amount for my needs, and tasted perfect!  Highly recommended and not too spicy despite the seemingly large amount of chili powder.  My mother had it and commented that it wasn't too spicy.  She was shocked when I told her how much chili powder it had.  Will make again when I make enchiladas.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I will never use store bought again. Next time I might add a little more chili powder and tomato sauce for a stronger flavor.

The store was out of enchilada sauce so I found this recipe.  I don't used the canned stuff enough to compare, but this had a real good flavor.  Used Wondra and cut water to 1 cup as others suggested.  Used 2T of chili powder but then added an additional 1 as it needed a bit more flavor.  Super easy to make!

I hesitate to rate this recipe because I didn't use all of the right ingredients.  I had Tone's chili powder, not what the recipe called for, and 1/4 cup was way too much.  I should have been more cautious about adding it.  A friend suggested that the bitter taste that resulted could have been from too much cumin, as there is cumin in that chili powder as well as in the recipe.  I ended up taking out half the sauce and adding two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes that I pureed and some sauteed onions (also pureed).  That did the trick.  I would make this again but with much less of this chili powder--or with the right kind of chili powder!

Make this a 5-minute enchilada sauce. Try whipping it up in the microwave! Heat your oil about one minute on high in a microwave bowl big enough for the whole batch of sauce. Add flour (I used all purpose) and chili powder. Stir it all up until there are no lumps. Heat it for about 1 minute more on high, stirring once at the 30 second mark, to “brown” mixture. It gets thick and the chili powder made mine quite dark brown from the start. Add water, tomato sauce, spices. Stir it all into the chili powder/ flour roux, thinning it. Heat it on high for about 3 minutes more, stirring once at midpoint. Voila, (or is that Ole?) you’ve got a great red sauce, slightly thickened like you want. I made mine ahead. I refrigerated it, then reheated it to assemble my enchiladas. So easy and tasty. No more canned sauce for me!

Simply wonderful.  As with other reviewers I was concerned about the 1/4 cup of chili powder.  I added two tablespoons initially and then added the other two after all ingredients were added for more flavor.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a little fresh garlic rather than garlic salt.  The recipe is really very easy and I will make it again.  Other reviewers suggested taking the oil out.  I may try cutting it back next time.  The sauce wasn't greasy, but I am always looking for ways to cut fat.

super quick and easy...tweaked it a bit with dash of cinnamon, onion powder, subbed 1/2 chicken stock for water and used half the oil...don't cook for TOO long bc it gets really thick and I had to make a 2nd batch to cover all of the enchiladas.

Really good Brandi! Used onion powder, beef broth instead of water and just for fun threw in a half teaspoon of cinnamon and about a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. This was my first attempt at making my own sauce and I'm so glad I did because I honestly don't think I could ever go back to canned again. My gang loved it. Thanks so much!

This was an awesome sauce.  I made a few changes to it though---decreased chili poweder by half, used a 28oz can of tomato sauce, added 2Tbls sugar and also 2Tbls of sour cream to make it a little more creamy.  Made this way my two small children (5 and 3) were able to eat this with no problem, otherwise I think it would have been too hot for them.  They just loved it.  It was our first time ever having enchiladas and now is a new favorite dish to make.

I thought that using self-rising flour and browning the chili powder with the roux might account for the slight off taste that other reviewers mentioned.  I used Wondra instant mix flour.  As soon as the flour/oil mix was lightly browned, I removed the pan from the heat and whisked in the chili powder and other spices.  After the water and tomato sauce were added, I returned it to the heat and let it cook until slightly thick.  I only had half the required amount of chili powder on hand, but it was still very nicely spiced.  We thought it had excellent flavor and was far superior to canned or packaged enchilada sauce.  It was very easy to make and used items I always have in my pantry.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Wow, I really like this sauce! It's so easy and tasty, definitely in my top three favorite enchilada sauce recipes but I suspect I'll start using this one the most because it's so quick and easy.  I only madea couple changes, I diced about 1/4 cup of white onion really small and also used two cloves of minced garlic instead of the powder.  Delicious over my shredded beef enchiladas.  Thanks!

Yes the amount of chili powder was way too much! I had to add more chicken broth and another 8 oz can of tomato sauce! I will make it again but add way less chili! It came out really good on my homemade chicken and cheese enchiladas!

I made enough  to fill a quart jar, it was THAT GOOD! I think the key to getting a deep, flavorful sauce is making sure to cook the flour/chile mixture long enough. It needs to be very fragrant! Basically, you're trying to toast the spices & get them to release their oils, which is how the flavors develop. I've kept this sauce in my fridge for up to 9 months & it still tastes delicioso! Buen Provecho!

I have made this sauce exactly as is multiple times. It doesn't get any easier than this! It needs no modifications as far as I'm concerned. I have used it for enchiladas, chiliquilas, and for tamales. It is my go to sauce!

I'm not sure if anyone else had the problem of stirring the flour  and chile powder into the oil and simmering without burning the mixture.  I couldn't tell when the flour turned light brown because the chile powder was so dark.  In the end, the sauce tasted like burned flour.  Threw everything out and started over.  I didn't add the chile powder until the oil/flour was a light brown and then added the powder, stirred it in, and added the rest of the ingredients immediately.   It is such a great recipe!

This was EXCELLENT and will now be my "go to" enchilada sauce. I doubled the recipe and it made PLENTY for a 9x12-inch pan of chicken enchiladas. I did make a small tweak to the recipe, adding a pinch of cinnamon and 3/4 t. cocoa powder. I also let it simmsr (for about 20-30 minutes) as I put together my enchilada filling. I used the chicken broth from boiling my chicken, before shredding, rather than the water. YUM!

First time, made exactly per recipe.  WAY too much chili powder, for me. Overpowering!  I poured it down the drain.  Immediately remade, using 2 TBSP chili powder, with excellent results. This is my go-to recipe for enchilada sauce using 2T chili powder.  Additional comment: self-rising flour is not necessary in a sauce.

This was so easy and such a life saver when I realized I didn't have any canned sauce. I cut some onion and fresh garlic and sautéed in the oil first, then added regular flour. I followed the rest of the recipe using chicken broth instead of water. I also added a cube of semisweet chocolate as suggested. Yummo! It had a nice thick, rich consistency and flavor that made the canned look pathetic. I will definitely make this again! Thank you, BRANDI T!

Made as instructed. New Favorite! Easy too! I will NEVER use canned stuff again! Single recipe makes just enough for a 9x13 casserole. Bottom & in btwn "2 layers". Seek out the CA or NM chili powder. Usually found in a small package  in "Mexican" section  of grocery store. Totally worth the extra time!!

5 stars as it stands AND with changes. I'm originally from South Texas and was looking for a sauce that does my hometown proud, and this is it. Great red sauce recipe for Mexican dishes. Versatile too. I followed the recipe exactly, tasted it and then kicked it up a bit. To make as-is results in a mild flavor/sauce. I doubled all of the seasoning and added a pinch of red pepper flakes to heat it up a bit. Super easy and quick too!

Good taste overall, a little bland.  My real complaint is that I could taste and feel the grit of the flour in it.

Make the roux first! Don't add the chili until AFTER you add the broth or water.  The only changes are that I use is regular flour,  no tomato sauce, a dash of oregano and no salt instead I use either chicken, beef or vegetable broth.

Really good and easy to make.  I used canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and so I had to thicken it a little more.  Lots of spice

My family and I loved this sauce on our burritos. It was very easy to make. Before making this recipe I did read some of the comments Can & recommendations. I substituted chicken broth for the water and used regular chili powder. Can not wait to share with friends & family. Thank you to original user for sharing.

Looks like I won't be buying canned enchilada sauce anymore! This recipe was very easy, very quick, and it tastes great! I subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Oh, and I used standard chili powder from the grocery store, because I don't know what the called-for varieties are :). Really good!

We loved this sauce.  It was my first time making homemade.  I used regular flour and just plain old chili powder.  I can't wait to try the chili powder listed.  We used this on a 9x13 pan of enchiladas with about a cup leftover to freeze.

Of course, I had to tweak it!  I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and doubled the spices.  I also substituted a couple tablespoons of marsala wine for some of the water.  YUMMY!!!!! Five stars for my tweak!!!

Not having a can of store-bought enchilada sauce to compare this to, I cannot give it 5 stars, but I also felt it was inappropriate to rate it lower. It has a good flavor (I made the recipe with ingredients as was called for), but I would probably add a few extra spices (or just extra of the existing) to make it work as an 'open sauce' (what I call it) for enchiladas. I'm using it in a Crockpot recipe though, so it is doing its job to complete my recipe, and won't be the primary flavor of the dish. That said, good basic recipe in a pinch!  Thanks!

I made this exactly as written.  It had enough spice but there was no flavor.  I added a lot of salt and had to triple the seasonings to give it flavor.

TOO much chili powder, not enough of other seasonings. I made this recipe and it was inedible.  I then made it with changes;  2 tbs light olive oil, 1 tbs flour, 2 tbs Ancho chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt.  NO onion salt.  I also simmered it for 30 minutes.  It was excellent with my changes.

I tried this recipe tonight because I only had one small can of sauce and I had 5 grandchildren visiting and my husband's brother. My husband found this recipe. I have never tried to make enchilada sauce but thought sure I will give it a try. When I read the recipe I thought 1/4 cup of chili powder sounded like a lot of chili - my husband told me that many of those that rated it mentioned that they cut the chili amount in half - so that is what I did. I didn't have the self rising flour either and never use it - I used regular flour and it worked just fine. I don't know if my chili powder was Calif. or Mexico but it tasted just fine too. I had cooked a beef roast in a slow cooker and that is the meat I used for the enchiladas. I used the meat juice in place of the 1 1/2 cups of water. Often I cook chicken or pork this way for enchiladas too; I have decided I will use this recipe again and keep using the juice of whatever meat I cook instead of the water. Next time however, I will use fresh garlic instead of the powder. I love fresh garlic but I had 5 hungry children and I had started dinner later than I had expected - so to save time I used powdered garlic. 
The kids "loved" the enchiladas, I was getting a bit worried I was not going to get any. My brother in law loved the sauce too as did my husband. So it looks like I won't be buying canned sauce anymore. Oh, I used pureed tomato sauce instead of regular tomato sauce because that is all I had on hand.

This was awesome. I simply used chili powder from the bulk section of the store and it turned out great.

Exactly what I needed tonight for my enchiladas. Only one thing--I skipped the flour. And just a question--why on earth would you use self rising flour in a sauce?!? That is ridiculous!

Delicious and easy. I didn't have the special chili powder, just cheap dollar store stuff and it tasted great. I also added a clove of fresh garlic to it as well, and used a chicken bouillon cube in with the water.

This is a great recipe! At first I was afraid the chilli powder would be too overpowering for my family, but as the video says this is where a "good" chilli powder can make a difference...and it does. I followed the recipe adding only a little salt. I think next time I will do as another reviewer mentioned and make ahead to add a richer flavor. I won't be buying the canned stuff any more. Thanks!

Learn from my mistake: don't use a chili powder you already know is too hot for you!
I have this chili powder that is very good, but also incredibly hot. I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with a very delicious but incredibly hot enchilada sauce.
Our enchiladas were so so good... and hot.

This is a great base sauce. Following some reviews (and also based on what i had on hand) i came up with the best version for my family. From the get go, I didn't have flour so i substituted 1 tbsp cornstarch. I only had a regular chile powder so i used a dash of that. I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and 1 cup water. Then, i had old el paso original taco seasoning so i used 1 heaping tbsp of that along with a dash of cumin and half a tsp crushed jarred garlic. I also used a touch of lime juice and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, which gave it a great creamy consistency without a chocolatey flavor (tasted creamy and as if there was a touch of cocoa). I let simmer on lowest heat for about 20 mins before adding a little bit more of the taco seasoning and lime juice. It was incredible.

I combined this recipe feedback and mrs.espy's enchilada sauce recipe.  Reduced oil to 2 tbsp. upped water to 2 cups. Doubled cumin,garlic salt and onion powder. This tasted just the same as store bought enchilada sauce and or the Lawry's enchilada seasoning packet so it was as expected. Will definitely not buy enchilada sauce again.

I have to give this 4 stars because I had to change things up. As a basic starter it is 5 stars though. I used my own canned tomato sauce, however I used less chili powder and more onion salt. I also used a lot more garlic powder. It was fantastic. This is going to be my new enchilada sauce for good.

Excellent and add me to the list of those who will never buy canned again.  Used Los Chileros de nueva mexico chili chipotle powder and results were a full bodied, spicy hot, gourmet-tasting sauce.  I didn't change the recipe except to double it and use regular flour.  It's a "keeper"!

I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only teeny substitution I made was using half chili powder and half ancho chili powder and thinning the sauce a bit with water.  I thought the whole thing was great.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This enchilada sauce is excellent! I decided to make my own b ecause I don't care for the metallic flavor in the canned sauce )0;  I added a bit more water to make the sauce less thick and I added the spices in the recipe- but a bit more of each. Tomato bullion was added as well- great flavor!!!

I made this recipe using other's suggestions:  Doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan for lasagne, used vegetable broth instead of water, used red chilli powder (Indian - so only used 1 tbsp) and to make it a little less fat - only put 1 tbsp of oil.  It was delicious.

This sauce tastes alot like the sauce used in one of the really good restaurants in my town and it's really quick and easy.  My family loves it!  We have eaten it on enchiladas and also as a sauce for homemade tamales.  Delicious.

The base of this recipe is ok, but I tweaked it.  I used olive oil in lieu of vegetable, and infused 1T red pepper flakes into the oil before adding the flour and chili powder. I also added a can of tomato paste, fresh garlic (not powdered), and used about 3 cups of water.  Freshly ground sea salt, freshly ground pepper, simmered x 15 minutes, and I created a very tasty sauce.

This is really good just as it is.  The only changes I made were:  I use coconut oil exclusively at home and used three whole dried New Mexico chiles instead of powder.

Finally, real enchilada sauce!  I live in India and couldn't get the chili powder listed so i had to use Indian Chili powder, only 1/8 cup or 2 tbsp.  I followed another review where i increased the other spices to 3/4 tsp, very good!  thanks!

Love this! The whole family (except the doesn't-like-anything-8-year-old) enjoyed this sauce! The only things I changed was that I let it simmer while I was doing other things, and I added extra garlic. I almost always add extra garlic to everything, though.

I didn't have tomato sauce, so I put one 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes (un-drained) into the food processor, and I used the resultant puree in lieu of the tomato sauce and water. It turned out delicious!

I just used a random chili powder I had on hand and it still turned out good. I also followed the advice of one reviewer and added dark chocolate. It was delicious and I used it on the Chile Rellenos Casserole recipe from this site.

Coming from AZ, I was really skeptical about this recipe but thought I would give it a try as I ran out of enchilada sauce while making dinner. What a pleasant surprise! This was easy and the entire family enjoyed it. Thank you!

I didn't think this turned out well at all. I followed instructions as written and when I tasted it I knew my family would not like it. I had to do some serious doctoring to it to get it moderately acceptable. I won't try this again.

I think this sauce tastes much better than the canned versions from the store, those canned ones don't have ANY flavor. This recipe keeps in the fridge for a long time, too.

Im a really kind person and never comment on recipes... but this sauce was so 'not even swallowable' that I had to.   I wasted my last additional can of tomato sauce trying to help this   but still had to throw it all away.  I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first and like others..... it tasted like chili powder grease.  Sorry :(

I made this as written and found the chili powder was too overpowering.  I wish I had read other reviews before making this.  This might be a keeper with a few changes; but, I would not make it again as written.

The best sauce ever. I cut the chili powder in half and added 1/2 of a small veggie stock cube, and I used two-thirds of the water instead of the full amount. I added too much on the spices, which was intense for me (had I followed the recipe, it would have been perfect), but my husband LOVED IT. I would give it 5 stars, but I altered it a little based on others saying the chili was too intense.

This is truly fantastic!  My husband has a sodium restricted diet and i made this (minus the salt and onion salt)  to replace the usual canned enchilada sauce.  Very authentic flavor.  Thank You for this easy wonderful recipe :)

This sauce was a big hit. It was pretty easy to make and I enjoyed how aromatic it was, as well as the deep red color of the sauce. I used fresh onion and garlic, and only one cup of water (as suggested by other comments). It is faster than other sauces that I've tried.

Made a double batch of this and froze leftovers.  Very delicious!  Originally made because I didn't have any canned enchilada sauce in the house and I didn't want to run to the store.  I will probably make it from scratch from now on now that I know how easy it is.  Very easy to customize your spice level by adding more seasoning.

Good recipe we really liked it. Never used the can variety before so I don't have anything other than restuarant enchilada sauce to compare it to.  Will make again with a few alterations to suit our taste, like double the spices except for the chili powder I cut that down to a little less than half.  Haven't seen New Mexico or California chili powder here so had to use regular chili powder.  Not sure if that makes a difference in taste or not.  Also used some fresh minced garlic  to the flour chili poweder mixture when browning.  Might try using a little less oil next time to see if it compromises the taste any.  Thank you Brandi T for the great recipe.

This is exactly what I was looking for. I made one change though. I didn't have chili powder so I substituted that with Taco seasoning and it was great! This was excellent on "Fabulous Wet Burritos" another recipe on this website.

I loved this.  I did read reviews and added less chili powder and water.  Everyone raved about this sauce.  :)

This was the best enchilada sauce I have ever had! Added more cumin, onion and garlic powder to taste.

Excellent recipe. Very easy and I will no longer be buying enchilade sauce because this tasted so much better. I did alter it a little, I used red peper instead of cumin and used fresh onion insted of powder.

Delicious! My first try at this recipe I think I got the oil too hot and burned the flour. On my second attempt I didn't heat the oil quite as much and it worked really well. I added more garlic, cumin, and onion than the recipe calls for. Really easy and tasty!

This enchilada sauce was FANTASTIC!  I used this over White Chicken Enchiladas and it was one of the best meals ever - just ask my husband.  The only thing I changed - I used all purpose flour.  And I added a few green chilis.  I totally recommend this recipe!

We are travelling right now, (my husband is on temporary duty), so I had only the most basic of kitchen tools and a handful of recipes I grabbed before we left.  My enchilada sauce recipe wasn't one of them.  This seemed the most similar to mine that I could tell, except mine uses butter instead of oil.  I used 3 T. butter, and doubled all the spices except for salt and chili powder.  I only had about 3 T. chili powder left so I used pretty much all of it.  This was pretty darn good!  Didn't make quite enough and could've used perhaps some beef or chicken bouillon (which I didn't remember that my recipe uses till after the fact), but in a pinch this was great!  I'll use again and again.  Made the Pineapple Enchiladas from this site, and me and my pregnant belly are stuffed and satisfied (albeit very temporarily...) :)

This recipe was easy to follow and tasted nice. Not a lot of depth to it and since I have never had enchilada sauce before I couldn't comment on the authenticity of the sauce. I did find that the amount of oil used, and making of the roux seemed excessive. I would make this again but with many changes.

Holy cow! Maybe I used the wrong kind of chili powder (I had some chipotle chili powder so I threw the whole amount in) My husband and I both thrive on hot hot hot, but this was nearly inedible until I cooled it down with extra tomato sauce, honey and chocolate. Made enchilada casserole from this site and it turned out fabulous, so all was saved in the end. Do not recommend chipotle chili powder though (or a whole lot less of it!)

This sauce was amazing!!!  I used chicken broth in place of the water but that was my only change.  It thickened up really nicely and wasn't too watery, maybe because of the self-rising flour?  Anyway thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!! I used regular store brand chili powder and roughly doubled it so that I could use a 15 oz can tomato sauce.  But I DID NOT double the water.  It was great!!

I don't know if this is authentic or not, but it was perfect for what I needed it for:  the Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup on here.  I don't have tomato sauce other than italian tomato sauce, so I used two cans of tomato juice and left out the water.  Worked just fine.  Great for what I needed for.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good sauce. Only changes I made was to drain and puree stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce to cut the sweetness and use 1/2 tsp of fresh ground cumin. Gives it that extra authentic Mexican flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  As someone who has never liked any canned enchilada sauce, I was quite surprised how easy this was to make and how good it tasted!  I will be making enchiladas a lot more often now!

this is my staple enchilada sauce now. i dont buy the canned junk anymore. i have made this many times once i added too much tomato sauce, it was still great. this last time i didn't quite have enough chili powder so i put in an extra dash of cumin & a pinch of taco seasoning & it was still wonderful. hard to mess this one up!

This was my first time making enchilada sauce.  My hubby forgot to buy a can of it and he wanted enchiladas.  I found this one and I love it.  It isn't bitter like the can.  Also, I used less chili powder  because my daughter always thinks things are too spicy!

Very quick, easy and delicious. I took the advice of several other reviewers and used about 1/2 the chili powder. I also used less water (about 1 cup) and loved the consistency so I would suggest mixing the water a little at a time.

I thought this was a very easy and quick, and delicious sauce. Although I thought it ws a little bland, but I think it had to do with my chili seasoning. I used this sauce with the recipie for enchiladas, wonderful dinner. I would absolutly make it again.

I think this recipe is great, but I always alter recipes to meet my taste. I used beef broth instead of water, and added a bit of cocoa. Made the color even richer. No more canned sauce for us! I didn't use any salt...

Wow... it's rare you get both easy and good.  Since I was in a hurry, I followed the recipe to a 'T'. (I usually read comments and adjust depending on cooks opinions, but didn't have time.)  The only thing I found was the chili flavor was overpowering.  My kids are not big fans of spicy, so I added 2 tsp of sugar and it made a huge difference!

This was not an edible recipe, even with only puting in 2 tbls of chile powder rather than the 1/4 of a cup that the recipe called for. Not only was it underseasoned in respect to the other ingredients, but there was no reminent of the tomato sauce left. I give the recipe an E for effort.

Had a 15oz can of tomato sauce so just doubled the recipe. Had no problems with it being to thin but I made sure the rue mixture was a good color before adding my liquids slowly. Will not buy canned sauce anymore.

Five stars!  Easy, followed exactly (used onion powder because I don't have onion salt, and used the chili powder I happened to have).  Tasted amazing, made a lot, and super fast!  Just make sure to have enough chili on hand, because it uses a lot of it!

I made this for some chicken enchiladas tonight.  For some reason it came out a little salty.  Maybe it was the kind of tomato sauce I used...or the onion salt?  I'm not sure.  Overall, it had a good taste & flavor, though!

This is an excellent sauce.  i love mexican food, but wanted to get away from the canned sauce.  This is the only sauce I use.   Once I wanted to make it but realized, too late, that I didn't have any chili powder.  I used the adobo sauce that comes with the jalapenos, it turned out really good.

Great flavor. I was pleasantly surprised by this sauce. It is very authentic tasting and so quick and easy.

I'm a flourless eater so I omit the flour and I use less oil - probably about 2TB and this is a very good sauce.  Sometimes I add unsweetened cocoa powder about 2teasspoons and it gives it a little more depth but on it's own this rocks for flavor and speed.

Great sauce, better than a mix.  I used only 2 T oil, sauted a garlic clove, added dehydrated onion (instead of the garlic powder and onion salt).  Also, I just had regular chili powder which I decreased by half.  Because of other reviews I used chicken broth.  1 1/2 cups is great... it thickened up nice and had great flavor.  Made up six enchiladas.

Excellent sauce using Penzey's Chili 3000 and fresh finely grated onion and garlic.

Perfection! Don't let the amount of chili powder in this recipe scare you. It's not hot at all. I cannot believe how good this sauce is. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I've gone to great lengths to toast & roast my way to a tasty enchilada sauce. This one beats any of those hands down. Plus it was super easy. My only change to recipe is I thought it needed lots of salt.

I have no idea what the people that gave this a high rating are thinking!  When I saw the recipe at first I thought too much chili powder, but I went with it anyway.  Well, of course I was correct and the result turned out to be a spicy, bitter, burnt tasting mess.  I was able to rescue this by adding pureed stewed tomatoes and and more tomato sauce which resulted in a better tasting product.  I will say that I just used chili powder I had, not the N Mexico or California variety, but I really don't see how that would make much difference.

I have made this twice now and both times came out great.  The canned stuff is a waste of money and taste.  I did not have self-rising flour so I used all purpose and a bit less chili powder to save on cost.  It still comes out so much better than regular canned.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed with this one.  Never will I go back to canned.

No need for canned sauce any longer.  This is very good and so easy.  It doesn't have the bitter taste so often found in canned sauce. We found it a little salty for our taste so will be careful with the salt next time. We like this but may also try a little hotter chili next time.

SO simple, so tasty!  I usually don't like enchilada sauce, but this was yummy!  Because it is a quick recipe, it was hard to multi-task while cooking it bc I was afraid it was going to burn.  Still wonderful.  I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and any chili powder is fine.

I made this to the exact recipe and found it quite lacking in the flavors I was looking for. After significantly tweaking the listed ingredients, I had a sauce that was enjoyable.

This has real authentic flavor.  The secret is using really good chili powder!  I have made this with chicken, beef, and vegetable enchiladas...if you like good real Mexican food...use this sauce.  If your idea of good Mexican food is On the Border....skip it.

This was just an okay enchilada sauce for me.  I think I like the canned stuff better than this.  It was a little bland for my tastes.  I had to add a lot more seasonings to it and also some picante sauce to make it taste better.  I did like the ease and how fast this was to make tho.  But I prefer the red enchilada sauce recipe on the site over this.  Thanks for the recipe.

That's the stuff!  I've been looking for this flavor for years.  Canned sauce just doesn't cut it.  And it's so easy!  I also added some peanut butter... that's how it's done where I grew up in California.  Thanks!

Mmmmm... this was really excellent! I made this recipe because I accidentally bought 'medium' enchilada sauce at the store, and DH can't stand spicy food. I made a few changes based on what I had to work with, and it was really wonderful. I used olive oil (don't keep veg. in the house), less chili powder (about 3/4 of what recipe called for - family preference), and I made tom. sauce by heating 8 oz of water, and adding tomato paste a bit at a time until it had the right flavor/consistency (about 3/4 of a 6oz can)I let that simmer while I made the rest of the recipe. Also, added chicken bouillon to 1c water called for and heated before adding to recipe. I didn't add salt because of the bouillon. At the very end, I threw in 5 hershey kisses dark chocolate because I had 5 left... The end result was something I will continue to make. My husband loved the addition of the chocolate - it added a bit a sweetness and depth to the flavor. The sauce was nice and thick, and had beautiful color. This was fun and easy to make, even with the changes - Thank you for the great recipe!

Enchilada sauce is a little labor intensive compared to this one.  This sauce is very similar to what you would get at any "authentic" mexican restaurant in the US.  I like it and my family too.  I do use real onions (4 TBS), garlic (1/2 TPS)and regular flour and I add chicken buillon to the water (to taste) I add salt if needed.  This is still easy and it gives the homemade taste that maybe the powders cant.  Good luck!!!

This was delicious!!!!!!  I made a batch for me and my husband and then took some out and added additional tomato sauce for my kids that like things a little more mild.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  Fast and easy recipe!

I make this sauce at least once a week, it is so quick and easy. I used to buy only canned sauce so i have saved a lot of money.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I don't use self-rising flour... I don't think it makes a difference.

This was great! Nothing to it. I just used the regular chili powder I had in the cabinet, and didn't have self rising flour so I added a dash of baking powder and pinch of salt. Very good and saved the day (and dinner).

Made exactly as recipe stated.  Was WAY too much chili powder.  I would possibly try this again and start with 1T of powder and add to taste.  Was unedible to my entire family.

I cut the chili pepper in half and used ordinary powder.  I didn't have what it called for and we don't like things too hot.  I also didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil.  It turned out great.  I like that I have a better idea of what is actually in it.  Will definately make again.

4 stars as is, but 5 stars with the following modifications! I used a little less oil, but the same amount of flour called for. Used a total of 2 full tbsp chili powder, 1 6oz can tomato paste instead of sauce, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, a few dashes cayenne, a few dashes hot sauce, a diced jalapeno, generous dashes garlic salt, fresh garlic, garlic powder, 1 tsp dried parsley, and a few dashes basil. 1.5 cups chicken broth instead of water, and added extra broth powder.

Wow!! This is awesome. I will never buy from the store again. I did substitute the water with chicken broth and I threw in two cubes of dark chocolate. It's blowing me away.

This is great enchilada sauce. Easy, very tasty. I'll never buy sauce again. I think as others have suggested, the amt. of chili powder you use depends on the type. I used only 2 TBSP. med/hot chili powder from PENZEYS SPICES (My favorite & no, I don't work fr them)& it was nice & spicy. A 1/4 c. would have way too much. Thanks Brandi!

This was very easy.  However, I thought it was a little greasy.  I used regular flour and only 2 Tbsp. chili powder--otherwise it would have been much to spicy for our tastes.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used this recipe rather than using a packet for beef enchiladas.  I usually have everything on hand to make it, so I will keep the recipe handy.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out great. Very easy and flavorful. Be sure to use a good quality chili powder. I also added just a tiny pinch of sugar which I though added another nice layer of flavor, but the sauce is also really good without that. A keeper!

I agree with a few of the reviews, way to much Chili Powder and it was a little bland. My family did not like it at all, even after I added more spices.

I had to make a few mods. I didn't have tomato sauce so I reconstituted a can of tomato paste with water and a spash of wine. I added a tiny bit of molasses to offset the bitterness of it. I also didn't have good quality chili powder so I just used what I had, and it was still fantastic. I am going to order some proper chili powder and definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing.

By far the best I've found.  Very universal for Mexican or Tex-mex cooking.  Try a bit of this in a burger mix, or dizzled on top.  Fantastic.

I messed up and added a 16 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I doubled the all the spices except the chili powder and I used chicken broth instead of water.  It was truly awesome!  You really must try this recipe.

I wanted to try the recipe as is, and I really didn't like it, so I started over following a lot of the other suggestions.  I sauteed a half an onion, a small hot pepper, and a clove of garlic in about 2 tbsp of oil, then added the flour to that mixture.  From there I added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and equal parts cumin, garlic powder and chili powder plus some salt and pepper.  I also added some dark chocolate at the end.  This turned out fantastic and I will never buy canned sauce again.

It is *very* easy to burn the flour.  It is recommended that you have everything pre-measured as the recipe came together quickly.
The sauce seemed oily to me, next time I will halve the oil.

This sauce was the best. It was really, really close to the sauce my grandmother makes, I never thought I'd ever come close to being able to make something that good. And it was so easy! The only thing I changed was that I added 1 heaping tsp of peanut butter to the sauce and then let it simmer. I know, it sounds really odd but it adds something to the taste! (some people use dark chocolate, but my nana does peanut butter so thats what I used) I made this sauce to use with the 'Spinach Enchiladas' and the 'Mexican Rice I' recipes from this site. It was one delicious dinner!! I will use this from now on. Thanks!

This sauce gives your enchiladas a more authentic taste and it's very easy to make.  Be careful with the browning of the flour because it can burn VERY easily.

This is fantastic! What a great way to make your own, healthy enchilada sauce! I did only use regular chili powder, as that's all I had, and only half the amount called for since I have little kids. The flavor was wonderful and the spice was just enough to still be good but not turn small taste buds away. Great recipe! This one made it into my recipe book.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it tasted burned and floury when it was finished.  I was very disappointed.

Very tasty start to a good tasting sauce.  I wanted to make Chicken Enchilada Soup (from this site) and found that not only did I not have Enchilada Sauce, I did not have tomato sauce.  But I did have a can of stewed tomatoes.  So I stick-blended the canned tomatoes to make sauce and basically eye-balled the rest of the recipe.  Doubled the garlic and cumin and used chicken stock for the water.  Soup turned out delicious.

This is a great base recipe however I add 1/2 tsp. of regular salt and 1 tsp. of cumin to make the flavor stand out a bit more.  Also be careful NOT to let the sauce cook too long or it will burn...personal ezperience and it tasted terrible. But with those added changes its a keeper.  I refuse to buy canned sauce again since making my own is so simple

This sauce was extremely easy to make and was soooo good.  I did use the entire 1/4 cup of chili powder (although mine was labeled as "dark chili powder") and found that it wasn't too hot.  I don't like things too spicy and this was just right.  I used this in the Chicken Enchilada Soup I recipe from this sight.  It was sooo good.  Will definitly make it again and use it for my enchiladas. yum!!!

I too used this sauce to make enchiladas with leftover turkey meat and they came out great. I also used regular all purpose flour. This recipe was very easy and came out great, I don't think I will buy another can of premade, thanks.

I loved this recipe!  It is delicious and easy.  I added a little bit more garlic and cumin to it but that was just my personal preference.

Quick, Easy & Delicious... it really doesn't get any better than this!

I find this recipe incredibly easy, affordable and tasty.  I didn’t realize how easy enchilada sauce was to make until this recipe popped up in my search.  The way the grocery stores charge an arm and a leg for the small cans of sauce, I figured it was pretty labor intensive and had a lot of ingredients… this recipe has totally revolutionized my menus!!!

The last time I made enchiladas my husband told me he just did not care for canned enchilada sauce.  I had tried all brands.  I agreed with him.

I really needed to find a way to make sauce that tastes like what you get in restaurants, but is still easy.  I found it!  This sauce is great.

I am glad I read the reviews first.  I agree with other users who have stated to start out with less chili powder and add more to your taste if necessary.

I made enchiladas last night with this sauce. Everyone in my family loved them.  There weren't any leftovers!

Very tasty!  I used picante salsa and a packet of McCormick's chili seasoning plus 1 tbsp. Mexican chili powder in place of all the chili powder and tomatoes, as I didn't have cumin and didn't have enough chili powder or plain tomatoe sauce. MUCH better than the canned stuff, and so easy to make!

This is really good! It does taste like an authentic enchilada sauce (judged from the restaurant enchilada sauces I've had at least). I didn't use the specific chili powder called for, though, just used the ordinary kind. Maybe that would have made it even better. As it was, it turned out a good amount, consistency, and well-spiced taste. With ground meat, corn tortillas, some chopped onion, garlic, and cheddar cheese it made a simple, easy, and very tasty enchilada dinner that everyone liked!

This got 4 stars only because I had to modify the recipe, otherwise it's a 5!  This stuff is INCREDIBLE!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers--I doubled the recipe for enchiladas...only put in 1/2 the chili powder (just used regular chili powder), used regular flour, doubled the spices, and put in 1/4 c less water...I like my sauce thicker.  This is the best enchilada sauce I've ever tasted!

Wow.  This was SOOO good.  I had to improvise a bit and it was for the better, I think.  I ran out of chili powder and filled the rest up with chipotle pepper powder...yow!  Hot and smoky!  I also used masa harina instead of s/r flour.  I will use half on the enchiladas tonight and freeze the rest to thaw the next time!   Thanks so much for an easy, amazing recipe.  I love it!

I made this to go over an enchilada recipe from this site that called for canned sauce. I've only made enchiladas one other time & HATED them so I thought homemade might make the difference. Boy did it ever! Super-easy to put together and very tasty!  All six of my kids except one 2-yr-old ate it up and asked for seconds. My husband really liked it too.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so used all-purpose and added a pinch of baking soda.  With my children in mind, I cut the chili powder in half.  I think it would freeze fantastically if you use enchila sauce regularly. It's a keeper!

This turned out much darker than I anticipated--could have been my chili powder; darker isn't bad, it was just not quite what I expected. The taste, however, was very good. I made it as directed, but used about twice the amount of each of the smaller amount of spices. I also added a pinch of cinnamon, cayeene powder, and cocoa powder. I used the sauce on shredded beef enchiladas; the sauce is much better than canned sauce and so easy to make; no need to buy the store stuff anymore.

I don't know what self-rising flour is (novice cook) and since I buy chili in bulk at Whole Foods, I am not sure if it is New Mexico/California chili. But, I like the taste of what I got using regular flour and my no-name chili powder, although it could use a bit more spice... maybe the spices I have are not fresh enough. I'm using this for an enchilada casserole I'm making for Super Bowl dinner tonight and there will be plenty more spice added, so I'm not worried. I'll make this recipe again using proper ingredients to see if there is a difference.

I was looking for a good homemade sauce to top my chicken enchiladas; since i already had a great method for the chicken filling. I used this recipe and my enchiladas came out 10 times better. My family loved them as well, this is definetly going to be my permanent recipe. Thanks

This sauce is fantastic! I'm originally from the valley in South Texas and this is definitely a Tex-Mex style enchilada sauce.  I was reluctant to try this at first because the picture looked more like tomato sauce. I was thinking it would be more like a New Mexico style sauce, which I'm not fond of.  It must have to do with what kind of chili powder you use.  Use a good chili powder and allow it to brown in the skillet.  My sauce was a rusty brown and fantastic!  I made cheese enchiladas with it.  Corn tortillas softend in chicken broth; filled them with shredded cheddar; topped it with the sauce and more cheese.  Great!  This will become a regular in our house! So quick and easy!

This sauce is very good. It's so easy my husband made it for me!! I took the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of the water and added 1 T. of unsweetened cocoa powder.

Really good and really easy.  I only used half the chili powder called for, because I'm a spice wuss, and I only had regular flour, so that's what I used.  I actually screwed up and added the chili powder too early, but if it made a difference, I didn't notice it.  I used this sauce on the shredded beef enchiladas from this site.  Very good!

Quick, easy, all ingredients that I usually have on hand and most importantly...absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was use the broth from my chicken in place of the water that was called for.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Much better than canned enchilada sauce. Thanks.

I found this to be a very good sauce for enchiladas. I didnt change the recipe at all.  We will be using this from now on for all our red mexican sauce dishes, sooooo much better than can!

Super easy and really good. I added a bit of ketchup and a sprinkle of sugar, along with some fresh garlic to give it a kick. I will quit buying the canned stuff- this is as easy as opening the can and lots better!

I've been using this recipe for awhile now. Once you try this, you will never go back to the canned sauce. My boyfried begs me to make enchiladas all the time now and it's because of this sauce!! Make sure you stir well though, so you don't get any chunkies in your sauce. I wisk the entire time I'm making it! I usually put it over black bean enchiladas. Yum...

This was good, I especially liked the fact that the ingredients called for were things I already had in my cupboard. I used this sauce for Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas found on this site.

Fabulous as written but if you want a real taste treat - cook up some Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat from this site. Use the juice from the meat instead of the water in this sauce recipe. Makes enchiladas that are to die for, better than anything you could buy in a restaurant!

I am not sure how to rate this recipe. But that is my fault. Sort of funny I was writing this recipe down and not sure why but instead of writing 1/4 cup chili powder I wrote 1/2 cup!!! Well I doubled the recipe so I put 1 cup of chili powder, HOT!! I used so many cans of tomato sauce just to get it descent enough for my kids. Well all turned out well and I have leftover sauce in the freezer for later use. Well the following day I re-reviewed the recipe and figured out my problem. Well it's a good recipe as long as you don't goof up as I did. LOL! But I will make this again. Thanks.

I have always used canned sauce for my enchiladas. But living outside the US, it's hard to come by Rosaritas. :) This recipe was WAY better than the canned stuff! I'll use this recipe over and over. It was very easy and not too spicy. Perfect!! Thank you

Delicious!  I used part hot and part mild New Mexican chili powder and it was great.  Much better than enchilada sauce from a can.

Loved this recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  Used the sauce on black bean enchiladas and both were a hit.  I didn't have self rising flour so I used all purpose, and it worked fine.  I also doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent! I used Ancho Chili powder and substituted chicken broth for the water. Added additional Cumin & Salt to taste after the flavors melded. Delicious.

I’m guessing the type of chili powder must make a big difference. We used regular chili powder, and weren’t impressed. It got me out of a bind, though! I was glad to have the recipe on hand.

I personally hate oil. There was too much for me. But the recipe turned out amazing anyhow! I did it exactly as written but added a tbsp of sugar. Weird, yes. Just needed to cut that oily taste. It really tasted exactly like a restaurant! I will use this again and just cut the oil a bit next time. Perfect!

This was absolutely incredible.  It is the best enchilada sauce I have had.  I did follow some of the recommendations of other reviewers and reduced the chili powder to 2 1/2 Tbls.  I increased the cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder (I did not have onion salt) to 1/2 tsp each.  Also added 1/2 tsp salt.  Then also added garlic salt to taste.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Used over Angela's Awesome Enchiladas from this site.  Best ever enchiladas!!!

This is a good start for enchilada sauce but I found it a little bitter.  Since I was making chicken enchiladas, I played with a mole-esque version of this recipe by adding 2 tablespoons of semisweet chocolate, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and a teaspoon of sugar.  I also used half California and half NM powdered chile.  It was awesome!

This is my go to sauce for years, modified or not. It depends who is eating it whether I use the rec. amt. of spices or scale back some. That's not difficult. So 5  stars!

It was okay...I don't like the way vegetable oil tasted in it. I think it would be better with a butter (vegetable oil spread) base. I added freeze dried onions to the sauce, used less chili powder, and a little sugar.

I didn’t realize enchilada sauce  oils be so quick and easy.  Was perfect amount for my turkey enchiladas. I did double spices except for chili powder. Wasn’t sure it would need all of the chili powder but it did and then a tad more. I think it depends on how old/new your chili powder is. I added sparingly but did add all and about 1T more. Never expected I’d want that much. Thanks for the easy recipe!!!

First time around I miss read the recipe and only used half of the flour. It tasted so good that I made a double batch of enchiladas and needed more sauce. That's when I discovered my error. However, I preferred the first version with only one tablespoon of flour. It was much more like my grandmother's!

Wow! My need for homemade enchilada sauce was somewhat of an urgent one. The can of sauce I had was expired by almost 2 years! 
I followed the recipe perfectly (keeping in mind, I rarely measure ingredients). I am very good at eyeing it!  
My ENTIRE family ultra-loved these enchiladas! We absolutely love the way it tastes after just this allotted time, however,  my husband and I are truly looking forward to slow simmering it, maybe...or somehow slow, maybe low heat...to let all the amazing spices in this sauce to meld and come together in fruition.

This is a great start and I will definitely use the recipe again but with big changes.
2 teaspoons only of chili powder
Fresh garlic
Half the salt
Onion powder instead of onion salt

I was really happy with this sauce...I doubled the recipe but only used about 2/3 the chili powder. Honestly, I could have gone for the full amount, I think. It tasted so good.

I made this today to pour over eggs and tortillas and it was delicious, my boyfriend loved it. I didn’t have enough california chili powered so I had to substitute the remainder with pasilla chili powder, it turned out great.

It is very easy to make. Tastes great - very similar to a sauce you'd get in a restaurant. I usually make a double batch. I soften the tortillas in it before I fill them. This also gives me extra sauce to put on top when I serve the enchiladas.  It also gives me extra for leftovers.

Smells just like the canned sauce we typically use, didn’t taste as rich, but we will use it again and play with the spices. 
We did use tomato paste+2 oz water and 1 Tbls vinegar (to counteract the sweetness).

The enchilada sauce turned out good the only things I changed, I started out with a little less oil and I added a splash of hot sauce at the end.

This is a solid enchilada sauce that's quick and easy. But more importantly, my kids will even eat it!I always x2 the recipe and use it to meal prep 2 large trays of enchiladas. 1 gets eaten that evening and the other goes in the freezer for the next week.

Fantastic.  Did modify per some suggestions.  Used 3 TBSP chili powder (didn't have Calif Chili powder) and doubled garlic, cumin and onion powder.  Added 1 oz dark chocolate and used 1 cup of no-salt chicken broth with 1/2 cup of water.  The result was amazing.  The base recipe is also very good, but with modifications it is amazing and so easy. Won't buy canned sauce again.

Great with any mexican food, including burritos and tamales. Needs more garlic, and there seems to be no reason to use self-rising flour as opposed to all-purpose flour.

It got a little too thick but I had cooked the roast using Mrs Dash taco seasoning mix and the juice left over from that in the crock pot thinned it out just enough.  Tasted great.

Delicious!  Living in New Zealand it’s near impossible to get good enchilada sauce. This was perfect and easy!  I used 1 teaspoon chilli since we don’t get Mexican style and it was just the right amount of heat.

Made 3 times while trying out enchilada recipes for a Mexican themed dinner party.  First time followed exactly but w/o New Mexico Chili Powder.  AWESOME! 2nd time I blended diced tomatoes and  that worked just fine.   3rd time I tried adding garlic, put it into the hot vegetable oil (mistake).  Instantly burnt it.  I pulled burnt garlic out and continued on.  I also added a bit of cocoa powder to this batch and used the New Mexico chili powder.  This batch wasn't great, unfortunately I don't know which of the three things that I did differently ruined the flavor for me.

Well, I made it and I made some changes. I think I should have stuck with the larger amount of chili powder because I cut it back as a result of the reviews I read! Nope. It made it bland. I tried bringing it back to taste adding it back in.  I also added some dark chocolate. Added some depth. Not too bad! I also used beef stock, which thickened it up nicely!  It could have been spicier,  but I think it was still good. Next time I will  stick to the recipe.  Still a good sauce, better than canned.

I made this as directed, but ran short on chili powder by a couple teaspoons. The family liked it, but I thought it was alright. For me, it has a slight tomato taste to it, at first, then the spiciness kicks in.

This was excellent.  My husband says it makes it taste really Mexican.  We live in Romania where it is hard to find truly Mexican ingredients.  So glad to have found it and will definitely make again. ;-)

Very easy, I did substitute onion powder for onion salt, as I don’t tolerate salt well.  Still delicious.

after searching several other recipes, I decided on this one, but made  some slight changes  I thought would make it better from some of the other recipes...I used chicken broth instead of water. Also used regular flour. I also added fresh garlic in conjunction with the dried, just used less dried. I also added 1/2 tsp brown sugar. It was fantastic!

works well. I used plain flour and don't know why self raising is suggested. be careful and watch time after adding powder and flour to oil, easily burnt.

I used this recipe as inspiration rather than a strict guide, and it was perfect for that purpose! I prefer fresh chopped onions and garlic sauteed in the oil, which added only a little extra time to the recipe, and since I had a can of tomatoes with green chiles on hand I used that and decreased both the chili powder and the water. With chicken, tortillas, and cheese, a tasty entree!

This does have a lot of chili pepper taste and probably will reduce the amount along with the amount of oil used.  Try adding sour cream in at the end of the cook time if you like a more creamier, thicker sauce.  Very easy to make.

I boiled 4 dried New Mexican chilies, seeds removed in 2 cups of water for 10minutes, and then blended that up. I followed the recipe except for adding the blended chilies in place of the water and used 2 tbs of chili powder instead. I also used a tsp of cumin and a tsp of oregano.

I didn't have enough chili powder so I made some using dried pasillas and a few dried peppers from last year's garden mixed with garlic granules and dried oregano. Even with great care to remove pith and seeds, it's hot!  My only quibble is that the amount of oil seems excessive, since the flour basically deep-fried in it and I don't think that much is really needed to brown the flour.  I only had marinara sauce on hand, so there is a slightly Italian flavour to my sauce, but I think once I add it to my enchiladas that will disappear.

I did not have any garlic powder so I used fresh garlic that I made into a paste.  I toasted and ground my cumin and chili powder before adding as I have whole spices on hand.  I didn't have any all purpose flour so I used plain flour.  I used canola instead of vegetable as again this is what I have in the kitchen.  I like that making my own there are no extras that I dont want in my food and I can control the sodium. I feel like I stuck to the recipe almost completely and it turned out wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!

I agree with shangirl, don't rate unless you make the recipe as stated. So made per recipe. So 2nd time I made changes. I found this somewhat bland so I added double the spice except for chili powder and only used 1 cup of water. Added some hot sauce since I like spicy.

I used homemade chicken stock because I had it in place of the water.  I added 1 C of water per recipe for a double batch.  I had fresh chili powder so reduced it by 1/3 and added some dark chocolate coco powder.  Tweaked spices for taste.

As someone said, the important step is not over doing the spices and flour in the oil but allowing them to cook through before adding the tomato sauce etc.

This is a great recipe and quite fast.  I think the idea is that you can make it quickly but it will probably taste even better after the flavors have a chance to blend.  It is great because it uses things you should have on hand.  

Thank you for sharing.  I used it tonight for chicken enchiladas and my DH who loves Mexican food really liked it.

Sorry folks this barely edible.  Made it per the recipe, could not eat it.  Added additional garlic, cumin and some dark chocolate, better but not there.  Perhaps chicken broth would have been better too.  Will not make this again and would advise others to keep looking

I made it nearly exact to Brandi's recipe.  This was an outstanding sauce, way way superior to the standard bright red stuff served at most Tex-Mex restaurants.  I suppose how good it is depends on the quality of your chili powder! Some have complained of lack of depth to their sauce.  I used Frontier brand organic chili powder. The method of browning your flour in fat is making a roux. If you let this spice-oil mix brown properly and gradually it will create plenty of flavor with depth!!  Next time I would consider adding Chipotle powder for smokiness and intensity. Maybe 1 Tbsp of coffee for more depth too (it does amazing things to chili).

Good recipe,  as a starter, but was better when I modified almost everything. I made it gluten-free by using rice flour instead of wheat flour. I used avocado oil, I cut the chilli powder in half, added a 1/2 teaspoon of coriander, used fresh garlic instead of dry, and toasted all the spice and garlic in the oil before adding ground tomatoes (with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar).  I simmered for about 10 mins and added a 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

Really good, easy sauce. I made it for another recipe calling for enchilada sauce and it was ready in time to make my other recipe. Will definitely make again!

I made the recipe except using McCormick chili spice, and it was great! When I tasted the sauce before baking with beef enchiladas I was afraid it was too spicy, but it was perfect on the dish!

It turned out pretty good for a 10 min sauce. I doubled it because I made a lot of enchiladas and I added the seasonings to my taste. Nice base sauce, you can add what you like to make it your own.

I really liked this enchilada sauce. Much better than canned sauce and I always have these ingredients on hand.  I made it twice and the second time I added a diced chipotle pepper and it gave it a smoky flavor. Loved it!

I made the recipe as is--no changes.  I agree with another reviewer that the chili powder taste was too strong.  Besides that, I liked the recipe and will make again with half the chili powder called for.

I’ve made this enchilada sauce multiple times now and I really do like it because of how quick and versatile it is. Sure, it doesn’t have a TON of depth and isn’t super authentic but I like it way better than the cans. Most of the time I follow as is- and I’ve used this sauce to make skillets, enchilada soup and made soupy to put over rice. I do add fresh garlic and onion sometimes for more depth of flavor especially if the recipes I’m using call for it anyways!

Was it wrong of me to use pure authentic Kashmiri Chilies for this??? I've made this recipe before (with CA Chilies), and it is a good recipe. 

The Kashmiri's sent it over the top. (And just for good measure I tossed in a little garam masala (maybe 1/2  tsp) for effect... Best Enchilada sauce ever....

This was so easy when you are short on time and don't have any enchilada sauce on hand.  I use regular chili powder (2 Tbsp.) and about 2 Tbsp. of raw chopped onions and a dash of salt in place of the onion salt because I did not have the ingredients called for by the recipe on hand.  I will likely continue to use raw onions in the sauce when I make it again.  They were tasty in the sauce.  I added the cumin and garlic sauce to taste, a little heavier on the cumin.  Super easy and the spices are flexible to taste.  Will definitely use again, no need to buy a jar of sauce.

I have only ever bought enchilada sauce in a can but I figured I would give it a try and make it from scratch and OMG IT WAS DELICIOUS.  I doubled the recipe and made my usual enchiladas with chicken, red orange and yellow peppers, and onion.  Covered the whole thing in tons of cheese, of course.   When I noticed the grainy texture of the sauce I thought it was going to be really gross but it turned out to be the yummiest enchiladas I've ever had.  I'm definitely going to make this a million more times.

Texan approved! I made this sauce exactly as written and it was excellent. I used a quality chili powder, and it was some of the best I’ve ever made - and I’ve made lots. The flavor, consistency, and ease of prep were all wonderful. I’ve used it on both beef and cheese enchiladas and it was great on both. This is the only enchilada sauce recipe you’ll ever need.

Great sauce recipe.  I did use AP flour and cooked for about 30 minutes to get a rich flavorful sauce.  Following other reviews I used only 1 cup of filtered water. I will definitely make this again.

For a little added flavor I softened a clove of garlic in olive oil and 1/2 green pepper sliced thin and added it to the sauce and cooked the sauce about 20 minutes.  
But it's great just the way the recipe is written! .

I made this with a few modifications.  I used smoked chipotle pepper instead of the California pepper and left out the cumin.  I put in two scant tbs. of the Chipotle pepper and that was more than enough.  I’ll scale that back when I make it again.  I was out of tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and increased the water.  It was quick and easy and had a good flavor, though had a bit more bite than I like, but that’s something I can easily fix when I make it again.

thought this was  basic easy to follow and a recipe you can taylor to your family's likes. It is the only one I have tried that has the thickener so it is a bit different texture than we are used to and the only change I made was to add Mexican oregano just because I like that in my salsa's and sauces a good last minute recipe when everyone wants enchiladas and your fresh out of sauce!!! thank you

This is so easy and delicious!! I made the mistake by adding the sauce and oil together first. So I just added it all together in the sauce pan with the flour and chili powder and it thickened up perfectly... I also added some ground cayenne pepper for a little zest!! Thank you!! So yummy

As a starter sauce it is great. I’d say it maybe just needs more of the onion, garlic, and cumin. I also add a can of Campbell’s tomato soup. A recipe my mother in law gave me over 11 years ago it’s called weeknight enchiladas. No matter what I do the enchiladas stick to the casserole dish, otherwise good.

The only reason I did not give this five stars is because , for  my taste,  I felt the need to double the dry  seasonings (cumin, garlic powder, and onion salt).  As suggested on the video, I added a touch of dark cocoa and cinnamon. Am using this sauce for the tomato sauce  topping for the Chili Rellenos Casserole by Clarissa2. It really is delicious.

This was great!  I was in a rush so I made it as is and it was great.  I will read others reviews another time even though it turned out great!

I used this the first time I ever made sauce from scratch.  My family loves it!  They never want me to use a packet or a can again!  And, if you really like kick, like my daughter, try it with dark chili powder.

I have to admit, I am not exactly sure what plain enchilada sauce is supposed to taste like.  I have a recipe that calls for 1 can of enchilada sauce and realized last-minute that I didn't have any.  Thankful to find this recipe!  I dialed down the chili powder since my kids won't eat anything if it's too spicy.  I doubled the recipe (to use 1 15-oz can of tomato sauce) and started with 1/4 cup of chili powder.  At the end, I added another Tablespoon - I probably could've added a bit more, but I think 1/2 cup would've been too much.  I also used chicken broth instead of water because I had some in the fridge that I needed to use up.  I wasn't sure how it was going to work, but I used it in my recipe and my husband said he liked the recipe better than before, so there you go - homemade is best :)  And boy did it make a lot of sauce!  I only needed 10 oz so I am going to portion out the rest and freeze for next time!  No more store-bought cans of enchilada sauce - good stuff.

It's a quick and easy sauce  to make, as the name implies.  There are probably better recipes and methods out there, but this is great if you are in a pinch and have little time.   I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but I was happy to be able to find it and use it as a basic guide.   My enchilada sauce turned out great with little effort.

This is a good start.  However, if you would like a richer more flavorful sauce make these changes.  Use butter instead of oil, use 1 cup of chicken broth instead of water, half the chili powder, add oregano, and double the other spices.

Used regular flour and half the chili powder. Turned out just like canned enchilada sauce, but I'd rather just buy it from a store and not bother with the effort.

Made this last night to go over my chicken/cheese enchiladas - the only change I made was to use regular flour. I also stirred in some sour cream (about 1/2c) since I was using it on chicken and wanted to add that usual bit of zing. Everyone loved it (4 of us polished off 18 big enchiladas) and it did, indeed, take about 10 minutes to make. Definite keeper!

I didn’t have the recommended chili powder, so I blended some regular chili powder with some chipotle chili powder. I used this in an enchilada style stuffed portobello mushrooms recipe and it was delicious. My husband loved it.

Loved it! I was a little worried before baking the enchiladas, because of how "tomato-y" it smelled, but it was perfect. Like many others, I just used regular flour (didn't have any self-rising and wasn't going to go buy some for 2 Tbsp).

This was my first attempt at making homemade enchilada sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, but ended up adding oregano after tasting, as it seemed flat to me. I wish I'd used broth as others had done, but adding 1/2 tsp of oregano and simmering a bit longer seemed to improve it (thankfully, I made this way in advance of assembling the enchiladas).  It's a simple recipe that I will keep, but next time will use broth instead, and add oregano with the other spices.

Also, when you add flour and chili powder together, you cannot tell when the flour is browned, because it's the color of chocolate right at the start. I waited and stirred until I was sure the raw flour taste would be gone, but I've made a ton of roux in my lifetime, and felt comfortable that it had browned enough.  Next time I will follow the advice of another reviewer and start with your oil/flour and add the chili powder once the flour has browned.

It was very powerful, nothing like the enchilada sauces that we eat in South Texas.   Too much chili powder made us cough. The sauce was so powerful that it made everything taste like the sauce, instead of being a nice addition it became the star that no-one liked.  Would not make again.

I didn't have self-rising flour, but everything seemed to come together well with AP flour.  I think the key to this recipe is using a high quality chili powder.  I served over Chicken Enchiladas II from this site.

Fantastic basic recipe! The key to true depth of flavor in 10 minutes is to use homemade chili powder and stock instead of water.  No need to cut back on any ingredients this way. Delicious, rich and luscious, makes great enchiladas, top tamales & rellanos,  even over chicken & steak, a winner.

Country quickmart only had one can of sauce at 4 pm for my dinner I was serving at 6 pm. This was quick and tasted very authentic. I found it mild in flavor but added chili powder bit by bit to be safe. I will just go in one dose next time as 1\4 cup was not too much for our palates. Did go heavier on garlic since regular is never enough for us.  Will never buy enchilada sauce again.

As other reviewers mentioned I used chicken broth not water,
two tablespoons of chili powder, and minced onion in place of onion salt. ABSOLUTELY awesome. I like to make everything I can from scratch. I must admit I had never purchased enchilada
sauce before....and I never will, now.  Love this easy recipe!

I have made this dozens of times and it is wonderful. I use plain chili powder and found I don't need to brown the flour and chili powder more than 30 seconds before adding wet ingredients.  This sauce also freezes very well.

From a family of Latinos, this is  a good sauce.   Add the cumin and chili powder to your liking.   Please do not add sugar, cinnamon or choclate as others have suggested.   If you want Mole,  buy it in jar at store and add 1 tablespoon of peanut butter to your chicken in the broth.  That is a different recipe.  keep it simple!

One difference I had was using tomato puree and about double what the recipe listed. It was a little bit thick so I would add more water next time but overall, the taste to this recipe was amazing!

Waaaay too much chili powder! It's downright bitter.  I had to dilute it with water and add some seasoning to salvage dinner.

I think it is possible this could be good, but it was horrible with the chili powder that I had.  I thought it was a mid-grade quality.  I would like to try the recipe again with one of the recommended brands.

This very simple to make using ingredients I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe to make a 9 x 13 pan of enchiladas.  After reading the reviews, I cut back a little on the amount of water used on this first attempt.  I found the sauce to be very thick and I ended up adding water to thin it when it was time to assemble the enchiladas.  Worked great for my shredded chicken enchiladas.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up.

I made a couple of changes, which is why I rated this 4 stars. I think if I made it exactly as is, it would have been good but not as great as mine turned out. I used chicken broth instead of water, fresh garlic, and a couple tsp of cocoa powder (didn't have any chocolate in the house). It was great in a one pot tex-mex rice and chicken dish, and I'm making more to freeze for enchiladas in the future.

A bit to spicy but great as a hot sauce for the table, when making a chilli or a curry some people in my family only like it mildly spicy, with the sauce you can make it hot to your own taste

Easy and great. I made it as read, and I have also tried using chicken broth instead of water. I think chicken broth is better.

It was excellent. Used it on this site's recipe for spinach enchiladas. I didn't have the chili powder recommended for the recipe (used a generic store brand) but it was perfect nonetheless.

I triple this recipe when I make it!  As a cook, my gut feeling told me to use less oil, less water, and some chicken bullion. Maybe slightly less chili powder for some people.  I still give it 5 stars since all recipes are simply guidelines to me.  I think any all purpose flour and your favorite chili powder will work fine.

I had home-canned tomato sauce (which is more watery)--so I subbed 1 pint of that and only 1/2 cup of the water--and it was perfect.  The only other change I made was to leave out the cumin--which we didn't have--but the taste was amazing.  The chili powder I used was from Penzey's, which is a darker red than some, so the sauce that a rich, deep red color.  Super EASY sauce and we WILL make it again!

This sauce is wonderful. I always get compliments, and it's dramatically cheaper (and better!) than than the canned stuff if you do it right. I buy a big can of tomato sauce (105 ounces) from Costco for $3. I buy all my seasonings in bulk, so even the incredible amount of chili powder (2 cups) necessary for this recipe is under $1. I made chicken stock with Better than Boillion (12 cups of water for this amount), so that's also cheap. All in all, under $5 for 6-32 oz canning jars full of Enchilada (plus some extra!). If the store bought stuff actually was better, I would buy it. But really, this stuff is better. I even use basic chili powder, nothing special (sadly, I'm sure it's better with the recommended kinds but I cannot find them to save my life). I do add about twice as much of the other recommended seasonings, and I make a roux with the flour and oil to begin with (then when it is properly browned, I add chili powder, stir rigorously for about a minute and add remaining ingredients). After this, I simmer it for as long as I can. This time it was about two hours. Longer would have been better, but as is, it's great. There is a taste to canned Enchilada sauce that bothers me. This, obviously, does not have that taste. To adjust the ingredients for a 105 ounce can of tomato sauce, just multiply everything by 8. Fully recommend!

Incredible! Absolutely delicious! Better than any brand of canned enchilada sauce, and so fast and easy to make. I made exactly as the recipe stated, except I used half of the chili powder.  The taste and smell of this was perfect. I will use this from now on to make enchiladas.

First time to make and very easy.  I did decide to add a little cocoa powder, cinnamon and agave nectar (sugar substitute).  The taste is great.  Will be using as a wet sauce for burritos.

It was very good and easy to make.  I used fresh made New Mexico Chili powder and it was just the right amount of spice.  The amount of sauce was just right as well, much better than canned sauce. Will use again.

This is my go-to enchilada sauce.  What I like about this recipe is that I can use lower sodium tomato sauce rather than the store-bought enchilada sauce varieties which are loaded with it.  This makes for a great base sauce exactly as is but can be tweaked to taste with additional seasonings or ingredients.   The only thing I do differently is add dried oregano.

wonderful basic recipe to "bounce " off of! My changes were as follows:  I started with a homemade broth that was made with skin and bones of turkey. the broth had been made the day previously and the fat had risen to the top. when I made my roux, i also added all the fat from the broth.  yes, use all of that chili powder! but be careful that your chili powder isn't already mixed with salt.  look at the ingredients! i ruined chili once as a young cook because i didn't know some chili powder is "cut" with salt.  On the same subject, I didn't add any additional salt because my enchilada recipe was gonna be salty already, and you can always add more salt later!   anyway,  I quadrupled the recipe ( prolly?) and added some cornstarch to help thicken it some.  I knew it would be fantastic and time consuming, so i made enough for 1 pan of enchiladas and then froze 3 ziplock bags of sauce for future recipes.[ { 1) add cocoa powder to enchilada sauce and you have mole sauce to cook with chicken! 2) wonderful addition to a pot of chili 3) more enchiladas!! }]This was  absolutely wonderful! Also, i used a huge jar of tomato paste, and added fresh garlic to it all. Lastly, in agreement with so many, the secret to a good sauce is a long slow simmer. yes, you can serve it in 10 minutes and that is fine, but I had the time today to start with a very watery sauce that I brought to a rolling  boil and then  let simmer for 1-2 hours ( i didn't time it) and it was outstanding.  I used http://al

I think this is a good base recipe. I used a little over half the amount of Chili powder and really think if I would've used the whole amount that it would have been too much. I really liked it, but my husband said it was kinda spicy for the kids (we were using it on bean burritos), so I may see if I can make it a little milder yet for them.

Good base. Even 1 Tbsp chili powder was too spicy for my crowd. Of course "spicy" depends on individual tastes. Added about 1 can of tomato paste, 1/4 cup beef broth, 2 T water, and 4 T lime juice (acid to cut heat). I didn't add any salt.  In the end I had enough, but barely, for two 9x13 pans. Saved the recipe as, like I said, it's a good starting point recipe to tinker with based on tastes.

This sauce is great and quick! I gave it 4 stars because I feel it called for too much chili powder. I added more water and seasoning to balance it out.

I absolutely love this recipe, and use it several times a month. I often have tomato juice left from making bloody Mary's, so that is typically what I use in place of canned tomato sauce. Lately I've been cooking with chickpea flour and this works just as well as wheat flour, and lends an earthier flavor that goes nicely with the chili powder.

Amazing sauce! Tasted great, only thing I did different was add about 3 tablespoons. My boyfriend thought it was missing something and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Without modifications, I would rate this 4 stars. With modifications, I give it 5 stars.

I've made this twice. I'd love to give more stars. I believe there is a typo (at least I hope so) - I think that 1/4 CUP of chili powder is far too much. If I ate that I would have to say goodbye to my taste buds, mouth, etc...Even halving it, I still had to dilute it. Second, it took much longer than 10 minutes. I did note a discrepancy between the title and preparation time.

This was very easy and delicious.  I did not have a can of tomato sauce, but did have a container of tomatoes I chopped from our CSA delivery.  I used an immersion blender to make it smooth.  Before dinner my daughter asked if she could have enchiladas without sauce.  I said, "No." and she ended up eating and loving the enchiladas with this sauce.

This is another "go to" recipe for me.
I used chicken stock instead of water.  The stock was made from two roasted chicken carcasses.  I also used half New Mexico and half California ground chili....El Guapo, the brand you get at Mexican grocery stores (Mojave is another good brand)  Since another cook complained about the strong chili taste I made it a point to throughly cook the chili/flour roux, making sure everything was well cooked...no off tastes, no bitterness.   The finished sauce was great, one of the best I have made

I didn't care for this recipe. It must have had something to do with the type of chili powder. I followed directions but didn't have the type of chili powder listed and used plain old chili powder. I thought it seemed like a lot of chili powder or not enough tomato sauce. I didn't like the flavor and smell.

Incredibly forgiving and flexible recipe. Made it twice, once totally "screwing it up" and second time followed better. That being said, both times the sauce was easy, quick and very good. 
Will be a go-to again and again.

Wonderful!!  Easy!!!  Quick!!!!  I used a potent 1tbsp of chipotle pepper, and it was some kind of hot.  And wonderful.  Used EVOO and regular flour.  The results did not suffer for the substitution.

I've never had enchilada sauce so don't know what it was supposed to taste like.  Needed it for a quinoa & black bean casserole and didn't want to buy it.  Added about 1 1/2 T. chili powder and it had a little kick but not too much for me.  Added 1 t. cumin and 1/4 t. cocoa.  Only cooked the oil and regular flour in the beginning to make the roux, then added the other things. The next time I'm going to try and cut down on the amt. of oil.  This made exactly 2 C.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me because I agree with other reviews, it depends on what area you live in and what tastes you are accustomed to. This saves a lot of time in the kitchen after many years of making sauce from scratch, even my husband gave it the thumbs up. I did double the recipe and will be making it again soon.

I panicked when I didn't have a can of enchilada sauce in the middle of a recipe that required it, so I quickly looked up a recipe for enchilada sauce.  This one had ingredients I had on hand (except I used regular chili powder).  It is much better than canned and so easy to make.  I put the left-over in a labeled freezer bag.

I cut down on the amount of chili powder the recipe called for.  I then gradually added more to suit my taste.

We like things a little saucy here at my house so this recipe served as a base to my own adaptation.  No offensive of course but have just came up with my own sauce that is adequate with what my family of five  enjoys.  I start off my putting my tomato sauce in a pot (50 oz.) then I just add the idegediatnts listed in the respice omitting the oil & flour rue ( I did this because ounce the sauce and spices where in the pot it was pretty thick as is.  Next I simmered it and "melded" the flavors together in hearty sauce. lastly I added 2 T. of sugar and 1/2 cup of water (still simmering for a 5 min. stirring after a minute or so)  This is the 2nd time I have made it my way and it's turned out fabulous each time. Credit to the original recipe for giving me that base that I was unclear of once starting out!!!  ***By the way my recipe made 10 enchiladas, dipped and rolled and set in a casserole dish lined in the sauce and smoothed on top of them as well before adding cheddar cheese***

So good! I added a dash of oregano and used 1 cup of water.  I also made my own tomato sauce by simply putting two large tomatoes in a blender and heating the liquid in a saucepan until the color looked like the sauce from the can (8oz.) I loved the rich flavor and how easy this is.

This was my first time to make an enchilada sauce. It was quick to make, and tasty. I don't know why the recipe calls for self rising flour, so I used regular flour. I think it needed fresh garlic, but otherwise it's a great recipe!

Delicious sauce! I made this sauce for some chicken enchiladas I found on another site. That recipe called for canned sauce. This recipe is very simple, but you do have to be careful not to burn the chili powder in the first step. Yumm!

The recipe itself was just ok. I had to make a lot of changes to get it to my liking. I made a 9x13 pan of enchiladas, so I had to double most ingredients. DO NOT double the water, however. It was pretty bland to me, so I added extra of all of the spices listed. Can't tell you how much, just kept adding until it tasted yummy. I like spicy, so I added cayenne pepper.

I did not change a thing (except using a little less chili powder than called for) and it turned out awesome... Love it... I will definitely make it again, and use it with lots of Mexican dishes and more :) Thank you for the simple and tasty recipe...

I don't think I need look further for any other enchilada sauce recipe! Though I couldn't see a reason for the self-rising flour and used plain flour instead, my whole family loved it. I did add some diced green chilies because I needed a little more oomph for the particular recipe I was using it for. This is a keeper! Thanks for a simple, quick, and tasty recipe.

This recipe is great! Enchiladas and fajitas are the only Mexican foods I like and this is spot-on. However, living in a small town in Florida, it is hard to find specialty spices, so I used 1/2t cayenne powder and 1/2t chipotle powder, I also prefer fresh garlic over powdered, so I used 3 cloves. These make it restaurant quality and still very spicy due to potencies. I have also added a dash of cinnamon and 1t cocoa powder and that gives it a deeper flavor, more may make it even better. The amount of water is a good amount as it should be cooked for a while to fully infuse flavors and cook the flour. I gave four stars due to not using the original recipe.

I haven't bought ready made sauce since finding this!  It is excellent as posted, but I do change it up sometimes, depending on how much time I have:   I use broth instead of water, either chicken or beef, depending on what kind of meat I'm using in the enchiladas.  Sometimes I'll use chopped onions and garlic rather than the powders:  salute them.in oil, add the rest of the spices and salute a minute or so more, stirring them into the onion mix.  If you want a thicker sauce, now is a good time to stir in a tablespoon or so of flour, then slowly add everything else.    I make this in big batches, then freeze in print containers for use later.  Excellent sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it wasn't goodl. I tried to add other ingredients to fix it but it didn't help. I ended up having to go back to the store and buy canned just so I could salvage dinner.

This was good. Like other reviewers I increased the cumin, garlic and onion, and decreased the amount of new mexico chile powder just a bit. I also used chicken broth instead of 1 cup of the water.

Just made this sauce and it was easy to prepare and turned out great. Only made a few changes. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe, used chicken broth instead of the water and used 1 Tbsp of chipotle chile powder and 2 Tbsp of regular chile powder. One reviewer recommended just browning the flour in the oil until lightly brown and then adding in the chile powder.  There was a nice amount of heat to the sauce and no flour taste. I will definitely make this again.

Wasn't really the best, but  it was better than canned. Basically tasted like chili powder and tomato sauce. It really lacked depth.

Four stars made as is.  Our go-to enchilada sauce with one tsp sazon substituted for salt & spices.  Our home frozen tomato sauce needs more cooking to develop sugar so I added one tsp to shorten cooking time,

Really like this recipe and can't see any reason to back to the canned stuff.  Like others, I did add a bit more garlic powder and onion salt along with a tbsp. of cocoa.  Even my picky husband LOVED it (I made enchiladas with the slow cooker cilantro lime chicken).  A definite keeper!

A great recipe to start with. I made changes based on the comments: increased spices but reduce amount of chili powder by half. Also, I threw out my first batch where I used a lower quality chili powder I had on hand. The New Mexico or Cali powders make a huge difference! Yum!

On fresh cooking binge - no canned stuff. regular chili powder.. Ordering NM chili powder from Amazon and making again. Didn't cook the flour and chili powder first but that was because I was in a hurry and didn't read the directions all the way through. The sauce didn't thicken up like I was expecting, but not disappointed. The family (including the little one) ate it all up and asked for seconds. Will keep recipe on hand from now on. Thank you!

The only thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of water. Fantastic recipe! So easy and inexpensive. Why would anyone need to spend $$ on canned sauce.

Really, really good for such a quick sauce! I  included a tsp. of chipotle chile powder in the 1/4 cup of chile powder. We didn't have any tomato sauce so I puréed a 14-oz. can of tomatoes and added about 1tsp. of sugar. We will definitely use this recipe again!

This is good, much better and healthier than the canned version. It was a bit overwhelming as far as the chili powder taste, I may make adjustments to it in the future.

I only had El Pato tomato sauce which is quite spicy so I only added 1/2 tbs chile powder. This is fantastic and so incredibly easy. It's now my go to sauce.

This is a good go-to recipe that can easily be tweaked to preference. I used slightly less than all of the water the recipe called for. I was thinking of lessening the amount of chili powder next time but my hubby said it was fine. I did not add the extra salt. My chili powder was generic, not a specific kind. I used my sauce on top of turkey-filled enchiladas made from corn tortillas.

I look for good basic recipes and this enchilada sauce is excellent! The overall flavor is very nice. Those who can't have spicy foods can use this recipe as is. For those who want more spice and heat they can tinker with this recipe to their heart's delight and have a good result. I added more cumin, onion powder, and garlic and made leftover Thanksgiving turkey enchiladas that were delicious!

Very good.  I didn't have tomato paste and used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead with a little more cumin. This is truly a 10 minute recipe, is very easy to adjust per taste and beats buying it pre-made.

For a speedy sauce, this was really fantastic! I used a combo of ancho and regular chili powders and also sprinkled in a touch of chipotle chili powder for good measure.  I dissolved about a teaspoon of beef "Better Than Bouillon" into the water. It came together quickly and made a smooth consistency, which was perfect for our cheesy beef enchiladas.  I love recipes like this, which can be easily tweaked according to your taste preferences or spice level. I will definitely be using this enchilada sauce in lieu of the canned stuff going forward!

Delicous. Instead of the tomato sauce and water, I used a jar of tomatoes I'd canned over the summer. I blended them with the water they were packed in before adding to the flour/oil mix. Perfect consistency and super fresh flavor. The chili ratio, while ideal for me, was a little high for my kids, so I added only 1 tsp of ancho chile powder. Definitely will make again.

I wasn't impressed. For one thing, I think I used a 12 oz. can of tomato sauce. There's also no logic to using self-rising flour instead of all-purpose. I tried tweaking this and it just doesn't have that perfect flavor.

I am not a fan of 'hot' sauce, but my DH is so I made this sauce and used it for beef and cheese enchiladas.  I had to double it cause I needed more sauce.  I didn't have another 8 oz. can of tomato sauce so I used some 'squeeze' tomato paste.  I kept squeezing til it tasted like 'tomato'.  I also put 1/4 teas. of cinnamon for a little extra boost.  I used Wondra flour (love it).
I let it simmer for about 45 min. while I gathered the rest of the items needed.  When I served it up he was amazed and declared it was the BEST enchilada sauce he'd ever tasted.  That's a big deal cause he eats lots of Mexican food here in the southwest.  So I had to write it all down for the next time I make it.  It's so simple and delicious.

Good enchilada sauce. I made this for an enchilada casserole. Like other reviewers I would suggest upping the cumin, garlic powder and onion powder to balance out the flavor a bit.

My wife and I had always used a specific store-bought mix. There was only one mix we liked and the store ws out of it. I googled Enchilada Sauce and this was the first one to come up. 

WOW!!!! We will never go back to a store bought mix. I was concerned about the amount of chili powder being too hot for my wife. It's not! The spices blend wonderfully and the sauce is easy (fast) to prepare. 

The sauce doesn't taste great just out of the pan. Don't dip your finger in it and expect to have some mind boggling tastes. It's meh. But once it's paired with your favorite enchilada the flavor shines through.

Best Enchilada Sauce recipe - EVER!  It was pretty tasty to begin with, though I added some cayenne pepper and oregano.  Next time I'll be adding some chocolate.  Even without changes, you'll never taste sauce as good as this in ANY restaurant anywhere!

I always make a recipe the way it's called to be done. Then if I don't like it I will add. I had to make this because I had all ingredients for beef enchiladas, but no store bought sauce. The next time at the store I bought 3 cans. Had to keep adding the same ingredients to make it better. It was too dark and too thick. Also a little bitter and a hit to the back of the throat.

I thought this tasted too much like seasoned tomato sauce. I prefer enchilada sauces made with broth and just a little tomato flavor. However, I think if you are using canned, this is tons better than that.

This sauce was perfect. I did not have all of the ingredients so I had to improvise on a few but it still turned out great!

I've made thus recipe more than once and it turned out great. I used "regular" chili powder because what was suggested was not at my local store . I was wondering if using chicken, beef or vegetable stock instead of water would make this recipe better. Going to try it!

I rarely review something here, but wished to do it on this recipe. I read many reviews before making it. Here's what I did: 1) I used 2 T Mexican chili powder (from Santa Fe School of Cooking) -- not enough!! Next time I will add at least another 1 T more and perhaps a pinch of cayenne. This comes from someone who doesn't like a lot of heat. 2) I only used low-med heat for the oil, chili powder and flour. There's low risk to burn this at this heat level. 3) I doubled the recipe, but next time I would TRIPLE it. I had standard-sized tortillas and doubling the recipe wasn't enough. When doubling the recipe I did NOT add in water or broth, so it was nice & thick.  I also used minced garlic and to use up some shallots, I sauteed 5 chopped-up shallots. I used an enchilada recipe from W-S. Hope some find this helpful.

I used regular flour and Penzey's regular chili powder instead of New Mexico or CA.  It was excellent.  I will do it exactly the same way next time because I can't imagine it being any better!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I added about 1 tsp oregano. It was delicious. I don't have ready access to enchilada sauce. This will be my go to from now on.

I needed a quick enchilada sauce for a casserole and this fit the bill.  It was really good for such a quick sauce and i'm sure I'll use it again.

WAY too much chili powder. I put half of it in (thank goodness) & it was o.k.  That would be 1/8 c.  Added a few dark chocolate chips & was very good.

Took others suggestions & used fresh garlic.  I also put less chili powder in but added a little cayenne pepper for the kick as was suggested.  This has more kick to it then the other one I make from this website.  I'll probably interchange them when needing enchilada sauce for variety.

Have tried to find a good enchilada sauce for years.  I made it exactly as written and it was great.  May tweek it a bit in the future but I liked it very much as is.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's become my go to sauce for enchiladas.

This lacked so much flavor! I think it's a great start to an enchilada sauce but I added other spices to actually taste good. Not using it again.

I wanted to make Chicken Enchiladas for supper, but I forgot to buy salsa (even though it was on the list) so I figured we could use an Enchilada Sauce in place of it, for that tomatoe-y element. I made this sauce, doubling it for a 9"x13" pan and cutting back on the chilli powder. It was pretty good, if not a tad bit spicy. I added a couple TB of Taco seasoning and a couple packets of chicken stock. I've never had Echilada sauce before, so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like or the consistency of it, but this sauce was pretty darn good on our Enchiladas. I used the Chicken Enchiladas V recipe from this site, and added about 3/4 cup of this sauce to the soup/sour cream mixture - YUMMY! I still had quite a bit of sauce leftover - if I put it in a jar, how long would it keep for in the fridge? Thanks for posting a great recipe!

We loved this sauce, the only changes I made were using flour, baking powder, and salt instead of the self-rising flour and cooking it in the microwave. Is true authentic sauce better? Obviously, but this is a perfect quick edition of a classic.

Tried doubling the spices. Was hesitant about all the oil and now having regrets from a health perspective. Used onion powder instead of onion salt as already salty enough and that worked fine. A nice entry recipe for making your own sauce, but am now looking for a less greasy, more advanced recipe. Won't be remaking.

I forgot to buy enchilada sauce so I looked up all recipes wow! Great ten minute recipe and I took some advice  from reviews. I used only 3 tablespoons of Chile powder and only 1 cup of water.  Turned out perfectly and just hot enough. 
Saved a lot of money not buying canned sauce will always make it from scratch.

We use this recipe a lot as a base ingredient for beef tacos, enchiladas etc., instead of packaged mixes!

Made this sauce for my enchilada. better than any restaurant in Springfield Mo. Did every thing the same BUT a after a taste test I put in1/8 t more of ground cumin now just right. Also when I just befor puting in oven lots of shredded cheese on top. Also cut some jalapenos sliced and put on top. PP

I love this recipe!  I have used it SO many times both for regular enchiladas and also for biscuit enchilada casseroles.  It just makes it.  The only change I made was one of necessity: making tomato sauce from water and tomato paste(1 cup water with one 6oz can)

I had to add an awful lot to this to give it some flavor. I'm glad I tasted it before I topped my enchiladas with it, it would have been disappointing. Thanks for the great base though.

This is a good basic and quick sauce. I took others advice and doubled the spices, used less than half of the brown sugar, and added a little cocoa powder to it. Other than that, I didn't change anything. I usually make my own chili powder, but didn't this time. I made the mistake of buying store bought. Would have been better with my own. I reccomend Alton Brown's chili powder recipe. It is so good and you will never buy chili powder again.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used regular flour and chicken broth in place of water.  This was great paired with Angela's Awesome Enchiladas from this site.  I already made a 2nd double batch to keep on hand for next time!

Of all the items I've saved to my recipe box, I access this one the most - surprised I don't have it memorized by now.  Followed the recipe exactly and find myself looking for meals to plan around it.  Best ever enchilada sauce by far!

This enchilada sauce has been on my monthly recipe rotation for a very long time now. It's exceptional! I use all-purpose flour and use Madras chili powder, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Thank you for an exceptional recipe!

I won't make enchilada sauce from a can anymore!  My husband loves it, says it's so much better, and doesn't make his stomach upset like the canned stuff.  I only put 1/2 the chili powder (personal preference), substitute chicken broth for water, and use crushed garlic.  Made it following the recipe exactly the first time and it was good too, just made changes to suit our tastes, so I can rate it based on both.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used Chicken broth in place of water, Best recipe I have tried yet. I will always use this one.  I made a double batch and you can freeze the extra sauce just add chicken broth to thin it with the next use.  I used both chile powders, 4 large cloves of garlic and 1/4 dices onion in place of the powder.  It was wonderful!

I am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe but it came out terrible.  Does anyone know if cumin can become rancid?  Or is it possibly because I used regular McCormick's chili powder? Would love comments on how to improve this or tell me of another recipe.
Thanks!

I tried so hard to like this sauce. It tastes like oil and spices, there's barely any tomato flavor and cooking the chili powder in a skillet with oil and flower burns the eyes. I finally had to make it from scratch myself.

I thought the recipe was wonderful and easy and will never purchase enchilada sauce from the store again.  I did use turkey broth for the water since I had it left over in the fridge but other than that I did not alter the recipe.

I make this all the time.  To go in my tortilla soup.  Mikes up easily and is just spicy enough that my soup doesn't need much more kick.

So easy and amazingly delicious. It was my first time making homemade sauce and it was wonderful. I gave it four instead of five stars because I cut the chili powder in half for a less harsh flavor.

This was excellent and easy!  I have tried others, and like this one the best.  I subbed chicken broth for water.

Yessiree and never never will go canned ever again. Our enchiladas would compete with the best Mexican cook.  I just seasoned it to the perfect taste and made enough to freeze for another great dish! Thank you

I made it in 10 minutes and gave it depth. Brown flour in skillet in advance until deep golden brown and keep it handy in a jar (keeps for up to a year.  Use high quality beef broth instead of water. Use highest quality chili powders you can acquire (I use several fresh blends that I buy in bulk at the health food store), use lard, not vegetable oil. Talk about depth.  Mexicans use lard, not veg oil. It gives the depth that butter would. Add fresh garlic and fresh ground cumin.  If you have all these things on hand, it's no problem. I didn't use any tomato's at all!

Great base recipe, but way too much oil. There's no need for 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I only used about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and it was just fine. I also used a large can of tomato sauce instead if the 8oz and I think it turned out great. I added extra spices -- salt, additional chili powder, liquid smoke, chipotle chili powder, etc., and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I'll make this again!

Read the other reviews used broth instead of water and regular flour this was fantastic! Yes I made changes I am sure the original would not have been bad either but I love the difference that broth makes in anything....ps I used vegetable broth.

This was by far the best and easiest Enchilada sauce recipe I have tried. My family and friends love it so much that they try to use it as a dip for tortilla chips. The only change I have made was to add 1 teaspoon of sugar to the pan (after the tomato sauce). Thanks for a great recipe!

I just made it.... changed a couple of things.. I had no garlic powder or onion salt, but I did have garlic salt and onion powder... so..... got carried away and mixed all the dry spices first... (dorkusinventus) got it all mixed together and percolating... tasted it.. very strong on the chili powder taste... oh well.. grabbed some smoked chicken breasts outta the  freezer.... chop chop dice dice... enchilada sauce, chicken, bit o local store bought salsa and about 2/3 cup of water... some green onions... and into the crock pot it all went.....  waiting.... waiting.... (this might take awhile...)   oh yeah... I added a pinch of dry cilantro and cayenne also to the dry ingredients... seriously doubt the boy will eat it....  oh well he can have more hotdogs.... Will let y'all know how it turns out...

Da bomb!! That's, by far, the best and fastest enchilada sauce I've made in a long time!! Change nothing, cook as the recipe directs and you got yourself an enchilada sauce that the FDA needs to know about!

was really good ... somewhat a "busy" recipe" but turned out good ...... have no no idea who took the pic of the sauce.. but turns out much darker  but flavor is great .. I did use "cheap" regular chili powder but had plenty of ZAP ....as well as AP  flour 
I like the fact you control the sodium and heat ...was really good 5 star on flavor 4 star on effort but will give it a 5

I figured there had to be an easy homemade enchilada sauce here... this is it.  It turned out GREAT! I usually make it as written the first time, but I wasn't paying attention until too late and realized I put in tomato sauce.  Luckily I was able to cut back on water, and the sauce was pretty forgiving, thank goodness.  Very good flavor, especially for only taking 10 minutes - a keeper.

I live in the Middle East where Mexican ingredients are hard to come by. I think this would come out better if I had higher quality Mexican chili powder. Regardless, I didn't care for the texture and it was lacking the tangy taste of a good homemade sauce.

I have been using this recipe for years!For a quick sauce there is a depth of flavor here more so than any supermarket brand. Add a pinch of paprika for extra smokey taste.

A good basic recipe but I did like less water (1 cup or so).  Used fire roasted diced tomatoes whizzed smooth and added roasted garlic instead of garlic powder.  The sauce looked darker with the roasted tomato vs straight tomato sauce, and I think it probably added some flavor depth.

This is a wonderful sauce recipe. I agree with other reviewers that it is better than the canned sauce that you buy. I also used the chicken broth instead of water and I used a garlic clove instead of garlic powder. Excellent and easy recipe I recommend it for anyone looking for an easy quick enchilada sauce. I hope to try the chocolate in the sauce as other reviewers mentioned.

4.5, if it was possible :) I liked it very much, but agree with some of the comments. Less water,   closer chili powder to cumin and garlic ratio. But it is very good! (I tried adding cocoa to a batch, it was also very good.

This one is perfect and easy.  Sometimes I put in a wee bit more chili powder, but that's it!

I followed the original recipe, except I used onion powder, rather than onion salt and didn't add any salt. I tasted it and it was not good, at all. WAY too much chili powder and it was really bitter. The sauce was really dark. I think the issue is the chili powder. I added another can of tomato sauce, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp onion powder. 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 and 1/2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp of paprika, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1 tbsp of rice wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp of sugar, to cut the bitterness. Left it on medium simmer while I made my filling, grated cheese, etc. Approx. 20 minutes to let the flavors, meld. It made a thicker sauce than I expected and really coated my white corn tortillas. I believe it reduced by a quarter, to a third. I used 2/3 of the sauce for 8 beef enchiladas in a 9x13 baking dish. I won't use *this* recipe again.

Used EVOO instead of vegetable, but everything else was the same. Delicious!! So much better than that canned stuff.  Will make this instead from now on.  Thanks!

My family loves Mexican food so much, we have it 1 -2 times per week. . We are trying to get away from processed foods, so we were happy to find this recipe.  Even though it says to cook for 10 minutes, we let it simmer until dinner was ready.  The sauce thinkened quite nicely, and developed a dark, rich, red color, perhaps due to the chile powder used.  It was so pretty I wish I'd taken a picture.  We had the last of the sauce tonight with buffalo enchiladas - we will be making more sauce!

Thank you for the recipe!

Super easy and pretty dang good. You'll probably have to tweak the seasonings quite a bit, but this is a really good basic recipe. I like to saute some finely diced white onion and a jalapeno or two in the oil before adding the flour and chili powder. A little bit of fresh oregano is nice too. Thanks!

Made exactly by recipe this is the best sauce imaginable. For the chili powder I take the dried new Mexico chili pods and grind them in my spice grinder to make my own chili powder.  Yummmm!!!

After making this recipe, my husband & I did not like the flavor. The chili was too bold and lacked flavor. I went to an authentic recipe and they used 3 tablespoons chili powder & 1 tsp cocoa powder ( I know it sounds weird, but this made it taste authentic) and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. Also, an extra cup water. This recipe just didn't do it for me. Good luck!

This was delicious - even if I don't know where to find anything other than plain old "chili powder". I would probably use a larger can of tomato sauce next time, just because this was really stretching it for the batch! Loved the taste though and will use again.

This recipe is very simple and easy to prepare. I've never been disappointed with the sauce. Just keep in mind that 1/4 cup chili powder = 4 tbs. Just adjust according to your spice and preference.

This sauce rocks.  I will never buy another jar or can of it from the store.  I added a can of green chilies to it but it called for them in Angies Awesome Enchiladas recipe.  Mmmm mmmmm mmmm.

Very easy tasty recipe. The chili powder is way to strong if you use 1/4 cup in my opinion. I read the reviews and went with 2 tablespoons and it was perfect. Love this one and will keep it as a regular.

this recipe is good, I took the advice of others and exchanged chicken broth for the water and just used a little less of the regular chili powder.  This recipe was helpful and I didn;t have enchilada sauce on hand and would have to drive at least 10 miles to nearest grocery store, I had the rest of the ingredients on hand

Great recipe. What I love about it you can make it as mild or mighty as you like by the addition of hot sauce or hotter chilis.  Don't need the self rising flour. AP works fine.

This was okay.  I looked in way too many stores for New Mexico or California chili powder to no avail, and it's too expensive to buy online.  So I opted to use regular chili powder, and the flavor was just too overpowering.  The hubby and I didn't hate it, but didn't think it was worth trying again without having the correct chili powder.

Wonderful! This tasted very authentic and was just delicious! However, this took me much longer than 10 minutes, because I was out of tomato sauce and had to make my own. I will continue to make this enchilada sauce using my homemade tomato sauce!!

10 minutes? Ha! But it was really tasty and made enough for a whole casserole plus about 2 cups to freeze.

Awesome recipe!! This is truly the best enchilada sauce I've come across, and I've tried many. Plus, so simple. However, I did add less chili powder and more of the other spice.

This was the best enchilada sauce I have made!  It was a bit thick even before letting it cook for 10 minutes so I just added more water than it said.  And I only have regular chili powder, which I thought tasted fine.  After stirring it and giving it a quick taste I thought it tasted a little too much like tomato sauce, but that really evened itself out and came out tasting great.  This is the enchilada sauce that I will be making from now on!!

Whoo-eww this is strong!  Tasted very authentic and super easy to throw together.  I used this in a mexican pasta bake and it worked wonderfully.  I'm going to mix the leftover sauce with homemade refried beans and mexican rice for some super quick burritos.

I made this to go with the Chili Rellenos Casserole on this site. I  had a 15oz. can of tomato sauce and so I added more sauce than water to the recipe than called for. I used onion powder in lieu of onion salt. Never seen New Mexico or California chili powder here in FL so used good old Tennessee chili powder called Tones and it was just fine. I did add a bit of fresh Greek oregano from my garden to the mixture. It tasted so much better than the watered down stuff you by at the grocery store, think I'll stick to making my own from now on.

Ok guys I am missing something here, my sauce came out dark brown from the chili powder, it had a smoky taste and was hearty good but nothing like the picture.  I used organic chili powder - it was also a little grainy even though I cooked it for 10 minutes.  Good taste, different color.  Hmmmm.

I just made this sauce and have to say FANTASTIC! I haven't even made the dinner yet.  I needed to buy 2 cans of enchilada sauce for the dinner I'm making tonight and my store had them for $2.49 a can and I thought "bull!" I bet Allrecipes has a recipe.  Followed other reviewers advice and halved the chili powder, doubled the other spices and used chicken stock, and added salt & pepper to taste.  I am NEVER buying the canned stuff again, this tastes so much better and cost me next to nothing to make and took so little time.  Thank you Brandi T!

This was a great recipe. I used beef boullion instead of just water. Also cut down on the chili powder. My husband the chef loved it.

I liked the red enchilada sauce that I made.  I did alter the receipe, thought.  I used 3 tablespoons of flour.  I doubled the cumin and garlic powder, but use 1 tablespoon of dried diced onion and 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of water and let it simmer for almost 20 minutes and then made a 13 x 9 pan of beef and cheese enchiladas.  They were great!  I will not purchase canned enchilada sauce ever again.

Very good sauce...I increased the cumin and garlic powder, used chicken bouillon 'faux' broth instead of water, and added a little bit of cocoa powder. Thanks.

This turned out great for me and I usually buy the can version. I had everything in my cabinate except the Mexican or California chili powder, I just used what I had. I ran out of white flour and substituted wheat flour and I couldn't tell the difference. I will be making this again!

This sauce certainly was easy, but very hot.  I live in New Zealand, so I have no idea where my chili powder is from (ie. New Mexico or CA, probably not).  I reduced to 4 T.  Very hot!  I will try again reducing the chili powder even more.

This was very easy and delicious!  Much better than store bought.  I doubled the recipe for 2 pans of enchiladas and it was perfect!

If I could rate it 10 Stars I would.  Fabulous.  I used a San Antonio chili powder.  It is a keeper!!  Oh and way too easy.

Very good, and very easy.  I did add half of the chili powder and chicken stock instead of water.  It was mild, but I have kids so it was perfect for them.  I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

can you say oh my GOODNESS? I have always used canned enchi sauce to make my hubbys favorite enchilada casserole. Never again. This sauce tasted just like a favorite mexican restraunt hubby and i frequented while we were still dating. I followed the recipe exactly except for replacing the water w chicken broth and adding about 1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder.  So easy, and so, so, yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

I guess I was expecting more based on the reviews.  I prefer the enchilada sauce from my Betty Crocker cookbook.  I hesitated at 1/4 cup of chili powder but went ahead added it all but found the end result lacking in flavor.

I used all ingredients except for the cumin, which i didn't have in the kitchen. Turned out really well, I don't really measure when I cook, I just taste as I go along. I probably used more chili powder, tonys, chicken broth instead of water, and tomato paste to thicken. It turned out really well.

Tried & true enchilada sauce. Just Fabulous! I am getting away from the Anything canned because of the BPA-(Bisphenol A)that lines ALL canned foods & drinks. Fast to make & you know Exactly what you are eating ! Add some black beans, corn  & cheese for great vegee enchiladas.

PERFECT! Exactly great as is. I didn't have the named chili powder so just used what I had and it still turned out wonderful. Will definitely be making this again, especially with how quick it was.

It's a decent sauce, but it is NOT enchilada sauce. True enchilada sauces does not contain tomato.

The sauce is good, but I think it could be better. The amount of oil seemed a bit much. I would cut it down. I also added an extra can of tomato sauce because it was not enough. I then doubled the cumin, onion, and garlic. It could have used even more flavor. I should probably also double the chili powder next time. It was definitely good, it just needs a few tweeks.

Decreased the oil to 1/8 of a cup. Used whole wheat flour instead of self-rising. Upped the spices to 3/4 tsp. as previously suggested.  Yum!

This got so many high star reviews I thought I could make it exactly as-is, but it definitely came out "bizarre." It tasted like chili powder mixed with oil. I ended up adding a chicken bouillon cube, a tbsp of sugar and an extra cup of water just to try to cut the chili powder/oil flavor. In the end I had something I was willing to eat, but next time I'll either look for another recipe or just buy a ready-made enchilada sauce from the store.

I made this for chicken enchilada soup.  The canned stuff has too much salt.  The soup was GREAT!  I offered to feed some friends that were over and one said they weren't hungry until I said what I was serving...he said he could make room!

After the canned sauce (containing MSG) gave my husband a gnarley headache, I was psyched to find this recipe...It was CRAZY EASY to make and came out pretty well the first time.   I read some previous reviews and did cut the chili powder, since I'm a heat wimp...I did however, add more cumin, garlic and all other spices and even still I have to say it was a little bland.  SO, maybe I'll try more spice next time, or tweak it each time to find what works best for us...overall a great base for a great sauce!

Excellent.  This recipe is so easy there is absolutely no reason to buy that canned junk.  I doubled the recipe and froze half for later.  After reading many reviews that said there was too much chili powder, I used half of what was called for.  I was happy with the results.    I coated tortillas with this sauce and used them to make the Shredded Beef Enchiladas recipe on this site (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Ten-Minute-Enchilada-Sauce/Detail.aspx).  I highly recommend this combination!

I prefer lots of sauce for dishes like enchilada, so I doubled the recipe.  I thought 1/4 cup chili pwdr was A LOT for even a double batch, so I decided to use only 1/4 cup (1/2 of what I 'should have' used)  Even then I thought the sauce was a bit too strong...I am SO GLAD that I didn't add more.  Next time I will probably use about 2-1/2 Tablespoons.  (My grocery store's options for chili pwdr don't specify 'Californian' or Mexican style.  So, I don't know how it's otherwise compare.)  Plus, I used chicken broth, a bit more than what recipe called for, as well as, using all-purp. flour.

First of all, let me state that I did not use this recipe for enchilada sauce but rather I used it for substitute chile sauce for "Barbecue Ribs." With that said, I tasted the results prior to mixing with the rest of the marinade. After tasting, I then proceeded to add 1 tsp of vinegar and then added to the marinade.

Excellent! I haven't made any enchiladas for decades, because I felt the canned sauce was too expensive.  I was spoiled because I used to buy it for 5 or 10 cents for a twelve once can in the late 70's. At the time, equal size soup cans were probably about half a buck.  Now enchilada sauce cost at least as much as a can of soup and I don't feel like paying more for watered down tomato sauce with cumin and chili powder. Last night, I turned a 29oz can of tomato sauce (One dollar) into a gallon of enchilada sauce with this recipe.  Tastes great and the enchiladas came out great.  Thanks.

I was making enchiladas and realized I had no sauce and no time to run to the store. This was easy to make and tasted exactly like the kind I buy at the store.

Overall this his is a good basic recipe. I did make minor modifications:  1) used 1 TBSP of All purpose flour. (Adding 2 will make the sauce too thick; more of a paste consistency rather than a sauce)   2) added 1 tsp of cumin to give it more of a mexican flavor.   3) I did not have New mex chili powder so used regular chili powder.  4) Used homemade chicken broth instead of water (use beef stock or broth if making beef enchiladas)

I used less than half the oil to make the roux.  And cooked it a bit longer to thicken.  So good.

This is a great enchilada sauce!  I have made many, but never have been satisfied until I found this one.  I followed the instructions except I used regular flour and regular chili powder.  My husband was happy with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

Made this with a few changes: only 1-2 tablespoons of chili powder and doubled the other spices.  SO GLAD I cut the chili powder called for.  Would have been way too strong!  Used the sauce to smother burritos.  Yummy!

Very quick and easy.  I use olive oil just cause it's what I have handy and it works.  This recipe can help people cut sodium if you find no salt added tomato sauce.

Overall, this sauce was good.  It is super easy, and doesn't use a ton of ingredients which is why I chose this one.  I can't say it's that much better than store bought enchilada sauce, but it was good.  I was concerned about the amount of chili powder at first, that seemed like alot so I thought maybe it was an error or it was going to be super spicy, but nope, it's right.  I had to make this sauce twice because the first time it burned right after I added the chili powder.  The second time it came close, but I took it off the heat when I was adding the chili powder though.  I'm not counting off for that because I was using a stove I'm not use to, and different stoves/ovens heat differently so that would probably explain the ruined first batch - just watch your heat when adding the chili powder!

Throw out the canned stuff! This one is quick and easy. I had some extra time, so I let it simmer very low for about 1/2 an hour and used fresh garlic. this sauce is a great base sauce and can be taken in many different directions. I used mexican chilli powder and it gave it a nice kick. I will never buy canned sauce again.

It was great to be able to control the heat in the sauce myself! I added some powdered chipotle pepper until I got a nice burn on the back of my tongue, and it was perfect. I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great, easy sauce to make. I added 1 tsp. of creamy peanut butter to give it a more authentic, Mexican restaurant taste. My husband, kids, and friends of the kids all raved and can't wait for me to make it again. My husband, by the way, hates canned enchilada sauce.

I am Mexican American but live in France and cannot buy enchilada sauce or make it myself here because Mexican products are hard to come by. This recipe is so tasty and pretty authentic. I am so happy I found it! I can now make my favorite dish and not be so homesick.

If you were thinking about using a canned sauce in your enchiladas, don't. This is definitely worth the ten minutes. I used it for Beef Enchiladas I by umi_says from this site.

This recipe was really good but I used homemade canned tomatoes and it was really good. Also used packaged chili mix for seasoning,I think taco seasoning may be better. I loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I used chicken stock and threw in a bit of extra cumin.  No salt needed with the salted stock.  It was good for me, but my wife and child found it too hot.  I'll substitute some paprika for some of the chili powder next time.

I began with this recipe, added a pinch of oregano, used rotel's tomatoes with lime and cilantro and added a tablespoon of grape jelly to take away some of the bitterness. Lovely!

Tastes like the canned stuff but without the preservatives and soy, which my daughter is allergic to. Pretty much what we were looking for since we had already started making the enchiladas and realized we were out of the canned stuff.

HOLY COW!  You can't beat this recipe!  I only used 1 cup of water at the suggestion of another reviewer and doubled the cumin, garlic and onion powder and it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe Linda!  I LOVE IT!!

this is the only enchilada sauce I use.  I can make it mild enough for my family, or spice it up it it's just me.

Not every taste suits every person.  This one certainly did not suit mine nor my husband's. I will keep searching for an authentic enchilada sauce.

I love this recipe. I'll never buy canned stuff again. Normally, I prefer green sauce for my enchiladas but this is so good, I can do with out the green sauce sometimes. I don't really measure anything but eyeball it instead. Turns out good every time. Thanks for the inspiration,

Wow, turned out way better than I thought it would! We used Oregon Spice Company's Chili Pepper New Mexico chili pepper and it had incredible flavor, nothing bland about it at all. However, it looked nothing like the photo,ours was dark, rust looking color. I would use this recipe again.

I plan to make this sauce to go over an enchilada bake reipe from Recipe Box. I am taking it to a potluck this week. I have all the ingredients for both. I do not like to read about a recipe and it's ratings when the ingredients get changed. Dietary substitutions are understandable but lowering a rating after the recipe has been altered makes a false statement.      If you make an apple pie with cherries then it becomes a cherry pie....

I used 1 C of beef broth instead of the water. 2 T of chili and doubled the other spices. I also omitted the oil altogether. This made it good but I am giving it only 3 stars since I changed so much. Mine already had a pinch too much chili powder so I can't imagine using as much as the recipe says.  To make the easiest enchiladas, I use hamburger helper's cheesy enchilada and cook as per package instructions. I roll this into tortilla shells and place in a baking pan, pour this on top, dump a lot of pre-shredded cheese on top and bake for 5 min and broil for another 2 min. Serve with shredded lettuce and for those that want, jalapeno peppers and sour cream. Very easy.

LOVED this enchilada sauce!!  Very tasty and easy to make.  I love not having to go to the grocery store and buy a jar chock full o' preservatives and chemicals.  I added an ounce of  dark chocolate, like some suggest--superb!  It gave the sauce a delicous complexity.  I only used 2 T of chili powder.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so used 3 T of regular flour and the sauce turned out fine.  

This is a WONDERFUL, EASY, DELICIOUS sauce--you really can't go wrong with it!  Went great with the cheese enchiladas I made for last night's dinner party.  Got LOTS of compliments and a request for the recipe!  Thanks for posting!

This is a delicious sauce!  The whole family gave it 5 stars.  I added 2 t. of minced garlic for a little more flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again. Its hard to believe something so easy could have such great flavor!

I think this sauce is fantastic, and so easy!  Being a wuss in the heat dept, I was fine with 1 tsp of chili powder.  Used a little chicken broth for some of the water. I usually get quesadillas at restaurants because the sauces are too spicy for me and taste funny.  I can make this sauce for all my Mexican dishes.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I used tomato paste instead of flour to thicken... which meant I had to simmer it for much longer. I took the extra time I had to grate the cheese & chop onions for the cheese enchiladas I used the sauce for. I stuck mostly to the recipe using the onion salt & garlic powder, as I don't like chunky sauce (I put the fresh stuff in the enchiladas themselves). I tried the New Mexico chili powder as suggested (whole amount) & it wasn't too hot at all. In fact, next time I think I will try 1/2 NM & 1/2 CA to make it a little spicier. I did substitute chicken broth for water & added the chocolate as some reviews had suggested, & it seemed to give it a nice extra touch. Make sure if you add chocolate to use a dark chocolate w/ about 50%-60% cacao, NOT unsweeted 100% cacao. I though this was a great starter recipe, especially if you have never made this type of sauce before, or if you are on a time constraint.

Really easy and tastes really good. As with all sauces, adjust the seasonings and consistency to your liking to fit the recipe for which it will be used. Made this sauce with a little extra spice and a bit of chocolate for depth, thanks to a previous reviewer. It was great over sour cream/green onion/cheddar enchiladas. Thanks!

This was okay. I still haven't found the "just perfect" enchilada sauce but this was a good base. I upped the amount of cumin and added cayenne pepper.

I had no idea it was so easy to make! I used regular flour as suggested by other reviews. I didnt have onion salt, so i just added a little diced onion. Also, didnt have a can of tomato sauce on hand so I substituted 8oz V8 juice. This was quick and easy and great for my beef enchiladas!

This sauce is fantatic as written. I add a little extra chili powder and garlic powder. It's smooth and tastes great! Chili powder completely makes this recipe. Without it, this is only tomato sauce.

I was weary when this recipe called for flour.  I left out the chili powder since I don't like spice.  Totally flavorless.  Won't make again.

I just made this for my mom's recipe of chilaquiles. I could have made my mom's red chile sauce but it requires more work. This taste very good. I only had regular McCormick's Chili powder on hand and cut down to what other reviewer's had suggested. I'm not a "hot" lover but next time I will add what the recipe asks for. It taste very good but it needed more kick to it. Consistency was excellent.

Very Good & Very Fast!!!! I used Chicken Broth instead of Water,& reg all purpose flour & it worked just fine! & just probably @ least a teaspoon or more of cumin, but I Love that strong Cumin Flavor in a sauce! Overall though great quick sauce recipe that went over very well!! Thanks!!

This is a great recipe.  I used "Fiesta menudo mix" from Kroger instead of chili powder, chopped garlic instead of powder, and chopped onions instead of onion salt.  No extra salt needed.  Update:  Noticed my comments were altered since I mentioned I used this to put into a soup recipe from another website.  I realized after my comments were posted that allrecipes has the chicken enchilada soup recipe too (Chicken Enchilada Soup II).  Need to try it - fattening but so worth it!

Very good! This is the recipe I will use from now on!  I used a regular sized can of tomato sauce (15oz) and pretty much doubled the onion powder, garlic powder and cumin, but kept everything else the same.

No more Las Palmas canned sauce for me!! This is wonderful the only thing I did different was use regular flour and for an extra "kick" I used the spicy tomato sauce by "el pato".  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Very tasty & very easy to make. I also used regular flour rather than self-rising. I had a can of chipotle peppers in the fridge so I added one of those also.

I'll make this again & again.

My family loves this enchilada sauce.  I messed it up big time the first time I made it.  The oil was too hot and completly blackened the flower.  Pretty funny.

Very yummy, better than canned for sure! I used New Mexico chili, but I think I will try California chili next just to taste the difference. It's not quite like the Enchilada sauce at my local joint, but it's close enough!!

This was waaay too chile powder heavy for me.  I read some other reviews that said there was too much, so I doubled everything else except for the chile powder and oil (to try and make it slightly healthier).  It still tasted overwhelmingly of chile powder, you couldn't taste any of the other spices, and it made the enchiladas kind of gross, even when topped with tons of salsa and cheese.  I definitely would not make this again without drastically changing the chile powder/spices ratios.

This was an excellent sauce, we used it as a replacement in another recipe and it was amazing.  I had a deep, rich enchilada sauce that balanced nicely with the Monterey jack cheese we chose.

Super recipe! Easy, authentic tasting, excellent!

One note though, for people overseas, those chili powders are hard to find. I personally use a mix of one part hot and 2 parts mild, to accommodate some of my friends here who cannot handle really spicy food.

My favourite all time enchilada sauce. The only time I've had it fail was my own fault as you have to watch it like a hawk when you are browning the flour so it doesn't scorch.

This was VERY yummy.  Now, I don't know what authentic enchilada sauce tastes like, but next time I'm going to try cutting back on the chili powder a little, (it was very spicy,) as well as the water and the oil.  It was very yummy, but I think cutting back on the oil would make it a little healthier, and cutting back on the water a little thicker (I just used regular flour.  Self-rising flour might have had a different effect.)  Thanks for this delicious, easy recipe!

I too tweaked the recipe using a 15 oz can of tomato sauce; splitting the flour with corn starch, decreasing the chili powder to 3 tbsp, increasing the other spices to a slightly rounded 1/2 tsp and decreasing the water to 1 1/4 cups. Very yummy !

This is a great and easy recipe. I followed the advise of the other reviews and cut the chili powder in half (because of my kids) and it was a hit with the family. It's cheaper than buying a jar of enchilada sauce too.

There isn't any need to spend $3.00 plus on a can of ready made enchilada sauce when you can make this. It is perfect. Way better than a purchased sauce and so easy!

Fantastic! It was pretty hot but I guess that depends on your chili powder.

I was in the midst of making enchilada filling when I realized I didn't have a canned sauce on hand. I found this recipe (the first I've ever made from scratch), and I will make it from now on rather than buying sauce. I followed the recipe with one exception: I added a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, and it was absolutely easy and delicious!

wow, never actually thought of making enchilada sauce before, but now I have to wonder why I ever bought sauce.  The recipe is easy -and seems to turn out great no matter the changes. I can tomatoes, so instead of using tomato sauce, I just used a jar of my canned tomatoes, skipped the water and it was a little "chucker" then from a can, but very taste.

Excellent!  I made this sauce to go with a chicken enchilada recipe found on this site - and my family devoured it!  My husband said he thought I should add it to the "rotation"!

This sauce is really good!  I changed it a bit and used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and only 1/2 cup of water.  I added a boullion cube for more flavor, and decreased the chili powder to 2 tablespoons, while increasing the cumin, garlic and onion to 1/2 teaspoon each.  Also, I had some corn flour, so I used that instead of white flour for a more authentic taste.  This sauce rocked and was far better than the nasty canned variety.  It's a keeper.

This was my first time to make homemade enchiladas and enchilada sauce and this sauce was superb! I followed the recipe exactly and only added a bit of minced garlic to the oil. Goodbye to enchilada sauce powder packets!

Not bad, but not great. Barely better than the canned stuff, and needed a lot of tweaking to be really good. On the up side, it did get me to try making my own sauce, which was much easier than I'd expected (I'd never really even considered it before). I'll definitely try this again sometime and see if I can achieve a better spice blend.
Also I think masa harina might be a better choice than white flour. It would be more authentic flavor. I usually have some on hand for a soup I make, so I'll have to try that with the recipe next time too.

this is so much nicer than the canned from the grocery store!! the chili powder in this recipe also gives the finished product a beautiful color. i used mexican chili powder (hot) and for those who love spicy it is perfect. for a milder sauce i might try half mexican chili powder and half regular chili powder.

I found that I didn't have the sauce I thought, so I looked this up (needed it right away)saw 5 stars and ran with it.  I'm so glad I did.  It was just like the sauce I buy (safeway/vons here)which I prefer over other canned types because the flavor, #1, and it is so much thicker. My son loved it!  I used Smart & Final brand chili powder, thought it was great. I will try New Mexico just to see if can be any better than it was.  Thanks for the great recipe!

With a few modifications, this recipe was perfect for making enchiladas with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I sauteed onions and garlic then added the flour with chili power and also added a chipotle boullion.  That cooked for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. I dipped the tortillas in the sauce and everyone loved the taste. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very good recipe.  I have no idea what an authentic taste would be, but this sauce has a very rich taste to it that we love.  I've never used onion salt, just normal salt since that's what I have on hand.  And it's fast!  Perfect for our family.

I loved this recipe.  I liked that I could adjust the heat so my kids would like it as much as I do.  I probably won't be buying canned sauce again, because this sauce tastes great, is easy, and has ingredients I always have on hand.  I used real butter instead of oil, because I prefer the flavor.  I also used all purpose flour and the recipe was a success.

Very easy to make.  I did cut back on the chili powder just a little. (used the McCormick chili powder and it still taste good to me).
Used regular flour as well.  I used the canned tomato sauce and just added water as needed to thin it out.

I made a few changes like paste instead of sauce (because I didn't have any, but added more water because of the paste) and used regular chili powder.  It turned out really good.  The sauce was a bit dark but I would make it again for sure, just using sauce instead of paste though.

I like to make things from scratch, since it's cheaper/it tastes better.  I did take a short cut thought, I still heated flour in oil but used a half a pack of taco mix for the spices.  It did the trick!

I found myself without any enchilada sauce, yet all set to make them.  When, once again, AllRecipes comes to my rescue.  This recipe is soooooo good!  I had a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce sitting around, so used that and tripled the rest of the recipe.  I used regular flour, and just kept adding water until I liked the consistency.  I let it simmer while I prepared the rest of the ingredients--this time I used ground beef. I also mixed in some of the sauce with my meat and onions (and sometimes I add black beans with the meat), which made them very good.  At the table I got 3 votes--1 too spicy, 1 too un-spicy, and 1 just right.  By making so much sauce, I was able to make an extra pan of enchiladas to freeze for later, and had a big container to freeze, so I'll have sauce for the next time I want to make enchiladas!!  Thanks, Brandi.

This turned out great, I thought it was much better than canned and my husband thought it was as good as the canned sauce so I won't be buying cans anymore!

I've never eaten an enchilada in my life, so I had no idea what I was aiming for on Cinco de Mayo. :) I used this for Black Bean and Rice Enchiladas, and I enjoyed it all! I used regular flour and maybe 2 TBS of regular chili powder (so our three-year old might be convinced to try it!). It was a nice sauce! I think it could be used in many different ways (on pasta, on chicken nuggets, etc!). Thanks for sharing, Brandi!

I think this is outstanding.  I always used canned but didn't have any in the house.  I don't think that I will ever go back.  I took into account the mild comments and increased the cumin, garlic, and onion salt each to 1 tsp.  I think that helped a lot.  The flavor was awesome.  I think if you really wanted to spice it up you add a little bit of red pepper.  You won't get the heat from more chili powder that was the perfect amount.

I was very impressed with this sauce.  I used regular chili powder instead of the specific kind mentioned in the recipe and people still raved.  The only thing I had to watch out for was med-high was too high for the oil on my gas stove - it instantly burned the flour to a crisp.  The second try, it cooked just right on medium.

We were nervous about the amount of chili powder but the sauce turned out great.  I made the recipe as is, with no changes, and we served with ground beef enchiladas.

I am in agreement with the other reviewers.  FANTASTIC!  The second time I made this I only had 16 oz. tomato sauce and followed recipe but used 1 can water and added 1/4 t. cinnamon for a Jalisco type flavor.

Pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I would do it again because it is easy to make and prefer to use fresh instead of store bought when I can.

Very Tasty!  Not too spicy, but just enough to enjoy it. Like others said, I will never buy canned again.  I followed as directed.  Reccommend to anyone looking for an enchilada sauce

This is a great recipe. My wife is not a huge fan of enchiladas but the kids (ages 5 and 8) and I love it. We usually eat the whole pan every time she makes it. And it's good with beef, chicken, cheese, or bean enchiladas.

Wow, this was super easy AND tasted just like I thought enchilada sauce should. I will definitely use this recipe again. I always have tomato sauce around, but I don't always have enchilada sauce when I feel like cooking a Mexican-style dish. I made chicken & cheese enchiladas using this sauce. Delicious!

I have made this recipe three times.. each time I had to change it a bit, but not much.  I totally love this recipe and I know you will too.  If to thick just add a bit more water, if to thin add flour.. at the end it'll taste just the same, Yummy!!

Beware using tomato paste! My local store only carries tomato bullion or paste, and erroneously, I choose the paste. Looking back, I should have used the bullion and decreased the water. I had a lovely chili sauce going, but the paste skewed the taste and texture. 5 stars before my mishap!

This recipe was quick and easy to make.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I substituted corn starch and it worked just as well.  Also, I found it a bit salty, probably maybe because I don't usually salt a lot when I cook and I added some salt and THEN added the onion salt.  But still, I will make it again.  Very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

My sauce needed a lot of changes .  I gave it a 4 because I am going to assume that my sauce did not turn out because I used only regular chili pwd.   I added chicken boullion and green chili salsa.  It was very good after the green salsa was added.

Maybe my substitutions made the difference?  I used regular all-purpose flour and regular chili powder and I found it to be WAY too much powder.  I ended up adding a can of tomato paste and some leftover alfredo sauce to cut the chili powder.  DH thought it was OK.  I might try it again with less powder and maybe some broth.

i thought this was great, especially relative to the effort it required (almost none). i dont see how anyone could find it either "sweet" or "italian" – the primary ingredient is NM chili peppers!

Probably one of the best recipes I have tried on this site.  Super easy, super good.  I did not have self rising flour, so Wondra did the trick and worked fine.  I did'nt have enough chilie powder either, so I substituted a couple of (chopped) canned Chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce. It gave it a little heat, but that,s OK with the family. And one final thing is I used only 1 cup of water the second time I made it.  I liked it a little thicker.It is a wonderful recipe as is, but adapts nicely to what you have in the pantry.

We really liked this.  I used it for a chicken enchilada soup recipe that I found on this site.  I just used chili powder that I found for a buck on the dollar shelf at the market beacuse I didn't have anyting else.  I'm eager to try it with better chili powder.  Plus, I did burn the flour (be very carful!) and so it had a smokie taste, but still very good.  Even with all my screw ups, it came out nice.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used finely diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and made a chunkier version of the sauce.  It was a big hit with my family.  *** EDIT *** Since my initial review, I have made this recipe several times, and still love it!  It's my regular enchilada sauce recipe now.

Excellent recipe! This was fast and easy. I only had 15-oz cans of tomato sauce (and I hate wasting things), so I almost-doubled the recipe. I also didn't have enough chili powder, so I used a blend of that, ground Chile pepper, and ground cayenne pepper. I also added a couple dashes of red pepper flakes, 3/4 tsp. dried cilantro, and fresh lime juice.

Excellent!  I was out of tomato sauce so I subbed a can of tomato paste mixed with a can of water and I ended up being low on chili powder so I had about ½ of what was suggested.  It turned out really well and we’ll definitely spice it up when I have more chili powder on hand.

Very easy to make, and very tasty as well. I used 1/2 as much chili powder, and regular white onions.

Easy and good.  Omitted the oil and browned flour and chili powder in a dry pan.  Cut the amount of chili powder in half.

This was really easy and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I didn't have 1/4 cup of chile powder though, only a couple of tablespoons. So, I added some taco seasoning to make up for it. I also added in about a half teaspoon of cinnamon and dropped in some milk chocolate chips too. I will most likely be using this recipe again. Thanks.

This recipe was great.  I needed something for dinner tonight and this was quick and tasty.  I did add a touch of sugar for the kids sake and used onion powder instead of onion salt, but the rest was pretty much as written.  I'll use it again and again I'm sure.  Thanks.

Yummy!!  I loved this!  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies instead.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I'll never use canned again. :)  thanks Brandi!

Out of the pan, it tastes odd, but I used this with the Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas, and the whole dish was yummy! I doubled the batch, but I only used half the recommended amount, and it was plenty spicy.

This sauce is excellent, and so easy.  To overcome the naturally bitter taste of the chile powder, we add 2 T sugar.  Gives it just that right balance.  Delicious!

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews. It was pretty spicy-I added less chile pdr and more tomatoe sauce and water. My 5 kids and hubby liked it ok but not our favorite.

Authentic and delicious.  I used 1/2 the amt. of chile powder because I'm a little gun-shy with REALLY spicy food, and it turned out delicious--just the right amount of flavor.

This was great and so easy!  I have tried every type of canned sauce, packets and other recipes.  This is the best!  Just make sure you seasonings are fresh.  This will give it a fresh and strong flavor.

The point is This is a great recipe do to the fact it is a good Basic so we can alter it how we see fit.. Very good thanks for sharing

This rocked, I loved the taste of the sauce, but my wife told me it might be a bit too bold for our 4 yo daughter, so I added a 28 oz can of tomato sauce, instead of just 8 oz.

I liked the ease of this recipe but I found myself adjusting the spices to my liking. I've made this many times, each time mixing it up a little until I found the perfect combo. I've found that cutting the chili powder in half, then adding garlic salt and table salt to taste give it a nice, authentic flavor without being too spicy.

It was ok, but I could taste the oil as an aftertaste.  Spices were good though.  If I make again I will do as another suggested and brown the flour and chili powder dry or atleast cut the amount in oil in half. It would be healthier as well!

Wonderful flavor. Easy to make. Truly authentic taste.  I have been looking for a receipe with this flavoring and glad I finally found it.
