Minnesota's contribution to the culinary world!  Don't forget to let this gem sit for a few minutes before taking your first bite, or you will have molten lava dribbling down your chin.

The recipe is very good as it is, but fantastic if you double the wochestershire sauce and I like to use 2 tsp of montreal steak seasoning in place of the garlic salt and pepper.
Two very important things - it is absolutely critical that you leave enough room on the edges to get a good seal.  If the cheese runs out, not near as good.  And by the way, if the cheese does start to run out, its done!  Get it off the grill or pan before you lose your cheese!  I tried to make this a little healthier with 94% lean burger....not near as good as when I made the exact same recipe with 80% lean.  You need the fat and grease for a great burger.
BTW - I saw 1 review that gave 1 star because the cheese leaked out (user error) and 1 gave a low rating because the recipe has a lot of fat.  REALLY?  Rate on the quality of the recipe, not on your ability to cook or you opinion of what is healthy or not.

Just about the best burger ever.  Saw the recipe on a food showdown recently.  Introduced it to my husband today for lunch and he was impressed.  Fresh ground beef is a must.  We like 2 pieces of cheese per burger.  A little messier but oooh sooo worth it.  Keep the napkins handy.

I have made these before.  They are good with Blue Cheese.  Try making with your favorite cheese and you will like it.

Needed a new burger idea, so I turned to "the buzz" for a fast recommendation and this was the only one that was suggested- ( NOT a recipe that would have caught my eye). I followed the recipe as directed, except with lean beef because that's what I had on hand. I was a bit concerned about all of the "ooze" warnings, so I smashed the patties out on waxed paper between two salad plates so the thickness would be as uniform as possible, and turned the edges like a pie crust to seal. Surprisingly, none of the cheese blew out, it almost "absorbed" into the burger. Served it on toasted Portuguese rolls with leaf lettuce, tomato and red onion. I had some "In-a-Pinch Ketchup"  in the fridge, (recipe I found on AR) and the flavors complimented perfectly. These burgers are  sooo "slap your mama" good (no offense "Cooking Mama"!), and we just can't wait to try them on the grill ! ....Thanks for sharing this one.

I liked the idea of putting the cheese inside the burgers; makes them neater!  Instead of the garlic salt and black pepper, I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  We both liked these and would make them again, but next time I want to try them with pepper jack.

Somehow, my initial review was deleted. I basically said what another person said, i.e., "heart attack on a bun," although I wouldn't make quite so drastic an evaluation.   However, due to its high calorie and high fat content, this is the sort of thing that should be eaten sparingly. I used very, very lean ground beef and low fat cheese, which helped to mitigate some of the unhealthier attributes of this burger.   Having eaten one just a few days ago, I won't have another for probably six months. Just too much fat!

Great way to do burgers.  I do similiar with Meat Loaf; half ground beef mixture (I also add a little squirt of Mustard and BBQ Sauce) on bottom of loaf pan, then lots of layers of Cheese, then top off with rest of beef.  Pinch layers together to seal Cheese in.

These were awesome!!! The cheese being in the middle is way better than being on top of the burgers.

Juicy indeed. I added cheddar and gouda to the center and froze them a  bit before grilling. I heard before tlhat griling semi-frozen burgers really maintains the moisture and it did. THeese wer good.  Easy to make, simple and good.

You can use any kind of cheese - I do this in a ramkin bowl the size you need, according to the size buns you have.Then put the ground beef (half ) cheese in center and put rest of ground beef on top. Seal it very good on all sides so cheese does not ooze out. Then I pat it out of ramkin and prepare the next . Cook slowly and DO NOT press down - Just flip.
I use extra cheese as we love it but do not use too much. P.S  on Toasted buns and with homemade baked fries,These are Yummy !!!

We too saw this on the Foodnetwork and just had to try it. A definite YUM! I used garlic powder instead of the salt but sprinkled in a bit of a much healthier sea salt. No such thing as too much cheese so we also added the cheddar we used on top. So good and thank you Cooking Mama!!!!!!

Made these last night on the grill and they were a HUGE hit.  Our children usually eat the hotdogs and not hamburgers but they were fighting over these.  Hubby raved also.  Used Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese between the patties (one slice cut into 4 squares for each burger) and will probably add more cheese next time.  Excellent--thanks!

We thought these were fabulous - so messy but sooo delish.  You really have to take the effort to seal them good or else the cheese will be all over.  Also to use any other cheese than american totally changes the burger.  Almost as good as a Nook burger :)  thanks for sharing!

I have seen these types of cheese stuffed burgers on tv and decided to make them when I came across this recipe.  Especially when I noticed the submitter said she likes hers with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I was actually wanting to use those tonight anyway.  We absolutely loved this recipe.  I didn't tell the kids I put cheese in the middle until they were already raving over them (because sometimes they don't like cheese on their burgers) and when they found out, they thought it was pretty darn neat.  And their father said it was the best burger he's had.  Yes, they went over that well!  I like to make it fun for the kids and arrange the dinner table like a burger bar so they can decorate their own.  Good times, indeed.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Cooking Mama.  They are definitely juicy and just the right flavor too.

Yum, Yum, Yum! I saw Jucy Lucy burgers on the food network and HAD to try them! This recipe was awesome! I used half pound of 99% Lean Ground Turkey and half pound of 97% Lean Ground Beef (instead of 1.5 pounds of 20% fat beef). I made 4 burgers with Deluxe American Cheese. They turned out super juicy and had only 240 calories per burger! I think next time I will try bleu cheese! :)

I absolutely love this recipe and my kids ask for it as soon as it gets warm out to grill.  On my burger I substitute the cheese for a sour cream and thousand island mixture in the middle.  such a hit!!!!

Oh my.  I doubled this since a friend was coming over, and I always have to feed my husband and his brother anyway, so these were the plan!  They didn't quite seal tight enough, but it didn't matter. These came out so good and so messy, and I was in hamburger heaven!  We used a lot of napkins! I probably took too much time flattening and patting the burger patties and have since learned it's best not to overwork the hamburger or it gets tough, but these were not tough, and the cheese was so melty that as I write this, I think I need to add them to the menu again soon!  We had a Caesar Salad with them as well as the normal hamburger fixin's.  Thanks, Cooking Mama!

These are excellant burgers the best ever. My family always ask me to make this all the time.  I used ranch seasoning instead of worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and black pepper. I also used saran wrap (plastic wrap) to put the two patties together it helps seals the edges together. Living in Minnesota I have had many different kinds of Jucy Lucy burgers and they all are excellant.

These were great burgers! I think I made my patties too thick cuz the burgers were still raw in the middle while the outside was getting charred. I'll have to work on that cuz the flavor was fantastic! Thank you!

Great burgers! Used a seasoned salt in meat, instead of garlic salt and pepper. These do puff up but they are so juicy and the cheese just oozes out when you bite into them! YUM!

Just yummy! Loved the spices, just the right amount in my opinion. We saw these on Man vs. Food and have been trying out recipes every since. So far, this one is the best we have tried!

We used to call these Bill Burger's (after my father-in-law, Bill) but we took them a step further. We made the beef patty's as thin as possible then added a good cheddar cheese slice, sliced red onion as thin as possible and sliced button mushrooms. The key is to slice everything supper thin and stack everything even. Make your beef patty's thin as well then crimp tight. Let the burgers sit in the fridge for a bit before cooking. Grill low and slow with a good Hickory Sauce so they are cooked well done then let them sit for 15-20 minutes before serving. YUMMMY!

I forgot all about these.  I used to make them when my kids were little only I would put ketchup and mustard etc.  What ever the kids wanted on there burger.  It made it a little easier for them to handle but be careful not to over load them.  They are delicious!

These are FABULOUS!  It's a great seasoned burger even if you decide to leave out the cheese but the cheese makes it so yummy!  I play on playing with all sorts of cheese flavors.  It hink a good Stilton would be amazing.  I recommend a really quality, thick Worcestershire sauce and not the cheap runny stuff.  Makes a great addition!

Saw these on Man Vs. Food. They looked so good. Someone should post a photo of one cut in half with the cheese oozing out. I barbequed mine. Sooooo good.

Turned out great.  Used the American cheese they suggested.  Was worried it was going to all leak out while on the grill but it didn't.  It was like a little pool of cheesy lava when you bite into it.  Delish.  Just be careful not to burn your mouth on that cheesy goodness.  I did take a couple suggestions from others to use montreal steak seasoning instead of the other seasoning and upped the Worcestershire to 2 T instead of 1.

I will make this again. First time user error I experienced was with the cheese oozing out. I will make my patties thinner and increase the diameter a smudge to make that great cheese seal. My next attempt deserves an audience. Cheers.

Oh. My.  I finally made this, and ... Holy cow!   So excellent!!  We grilled outdoors instead of pan frying.  I will say that if you choose to cut your burger in half after putting it on the bun, (as I did), be aware that the cheese will ooze out, EVEN if you've let the patties rest after grilling.  I'm not saying that that this is a bad thing...

Kids love it and want me to start a restaurant because they love the juicy burgers so much.  I added chili peppers to the center to give it a little kick.  It was a big hit.
Edited since first review.  Now, instead of adding chili peppers to the center, I mix in finely sliced jalapeno peppers, shallots and green onions.  I also use only 1 lb of meat with the same amount of spices.   Kids still enjoy it a lot!

Very close to Matt's in South Minneapolis, which I haven't had in decades, but soooo good.  Be sure to take the first bite with the burger below your chin or suffer the consequences. LOL.

These tasted delicious, but boy were they messy. I didn't seal them well enough and the cheese started bursting out. I think a few cheddar cubes might work better than the large flat cheese. I had bought some higher fat ground beef on sale at whole foods, I am not sure if they would be as juicy with a leaner one? I liked the flavorings in this. The only thing I did was cut back the black pepper to a pinch. I had l lb of beef and made 5 burgers, which ended up separating and becoming 10 mini burgers. I just cut the flavorings back 1/3 to compensate for being short 1/2 lb of beef. I may try this in the summer, on the grill, with the cheddar cubes. I will just make sure to seal them well!

Amazing and juicy just like the title.  It was one of the best burgers me and my husband hvae ever had.  I did change somethings.  I used turkey instead of beef.  I seasoned it with goya's adobo, I still used Worcestershire sauce, garlic, i used cheddar cheese in the middle, and I also added some A1 steak sauce.  I used my george forman grill and they came out great.

Great alternative to the regular hamburger!  Realized too late that I was out of Worcestershire so added BBQ sauce to beef.  Made patties on waxed paper for easy handling.  The only problem was after 4  minutes on each side they were well done on the outside but still undercooked on the inside so put in over for a few minutes.  Glad I saw them on TV and found the recipe here!

I didn't want to give it a low score because I've had the original at Matt's and it was AMAZING, but it's that usual not-as-good-as-the-original thing. Plus, I think the meat has to be a lot less lean than what I was using! Where was all the greasy goodness?

I love the very idea of this...saw it on Man vs Food and we've wanted to try ever since. We did make these according to recipe stated but the cheese seemed to have evaporated. I think next time I will try a different type of cheese and it will hopefully work out better-still great recipe I just have to do some personal tweeking.

tsk tsk..all you naysayers!  You can use ground chicken or turkey... and use low-fat feta or any other low fat cheese..(you can also add olives and onions to the mix for a mediterranean flair) they are SCRUMPTIOUS (and with so little fat in the poultry, they cook up quicker!)

This recipe is perfect.  I add 1 tablespoon of salsa and only 1/4 slice of cheese slice instead of stacking them up.  My family always asks for my now named Mexican cheeseburgers.  So tasty!

Just a note ... for the record -- the correct name for these little wonders is Jucy Lucy.  That's how they first appeared on the menu at Matt's Bar, and that's how they appear today.

Very good! Love Minnesota Juicy Lucy! Don't bother rating this if fat is a concern. That's like a vegan choosing to make this and then rating it saying there's too much meat in it. It's like ordering a Minnesota State Fair favorite, deep-fried cheese curds and wondering why they aren't healthy. They sell over 100,000 pounds of cheese curds at that fair and I have to believe they everyone is aware of the health implications by the ingredients used and cooking method used. Just saying...

Hands-down the best burgers I've ever made. I have made these twice, once with American cheese slices, once with muenster slices; once on the stove top, once on the grill. They are delicious if prepared as written, though I prefer them on the grill. These are SUPER juicy on the inside, so definitely give them a little poke before serving to drain.

Used the tips found in these reviews (added ~2t Montreal Steak seasoning in place of the garlic salt and pepper) and added more cheese (~1.5 Kraft slices, except I used Colby).  Used fresh 93%/7% ground beef, and placed the prepared patties in the freezer for ~20 minutes prior to griddling, then rested for ~4 minutes prior to eating. Held together beautifully and wonderfully juicy!

These are great, I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, as that is what I had on hand.  I have also, in the past, made a similar burger but in place of the cheese in the middle, put a pat of butter and seal the edges well.  Healthy?  No!  Delicious?  Absolutely! Not for everyday, but so great for a special occasion! Life is for LIVING!

I made it exactly as written and they were delicious!  I didn't put any holes or wells in the middle and no cheese came spilling out.  My husband does not like worcestershire sauce and always - always - calls me out when I use it - he did not detect it here - or if he did he loved the burger so much it didn't matter.  Thank you for a great burger recipe as we are now approaching winter time in western NY and our grill days are far away so this will keep us going for the winter!

I love this recipe! I have made a few modifications and use meso paste (diluted) in place of the Worcestershire sauce and blue cheese instead of cheddar. AMAZING. There are so many options with the cheeses for this that you could make a different burger every day. Very juicy, tasty, and flipping fantastic!

These were great burgers....my family loved them! I used 2 lbs of ground beef, a few splashes more of wortcestershire sauce and a few sprinkles of a montreal steak seasoning blend. These burgers were very flavorful and moist and loved the cheese all melty on the inside. I had no issue with the cheese leaking out. I also made them up ahead before grilling. Served with sliced tomatoes and carmalized onions. Thanks!

My husband usually grills our burgers so he was skeptical about these since I cooked them in a cast iron skillet. The whole family loved these though I forgot to tell the teenagers about the cheese inside so they burned their tongues but still said they were better than dads backyard burgers!

Simple and delicious!  I opted to replace 1/2 pound of ground beef with Johnsonville(R)Mild Italian Sausage.  I also used fresh garlic and a couple of pinches of salt and pepper.  I grilled these vs. pan frying and served them on toasted kaiser rolls topped with shredded lettuce and thousand island dressing in addition to the cheese. Perfect with a side of french fries and a dill pickle.

Had to try making these after seeing them on Man vs. Food. Delish!!! I did add an extra piece of cheese on top, plus added GrillMates Hamburger Seasoning to the mix. Making sure they are sealed properly and  poking the  cheese pocket after you flip is key! Otherwise,  the cheese will ooze out.  I made them on the grill instead of in a pan.

We thought these were wonderful.  I will add a little more seasoning, such as garlic powder, to the meat next time.
2nd Time: I used onion soup mix for seasoning and pepperjack as the cheese - not so good.  I definitely will go back to the recipe as written.

We really enjoyed these! I do have the worst luck with stuffing burgers tho, as most of the cheese leaked out, but these were still very tasty and I would make them again! I topped them with sauteed onions, lettuce and tomatoes. Thanks for sharing. :)

Putting the cheese inside gives it a great flavor!  The sealing of the patties is really key.

Omg, amazing. Used soft cheddar too, and I always mix tiny chopped onions into my burger too, didn't seem to have a bad reaction with the cheese. Next, I'm going to try and deep fry one of these babies.

Rather than a skillet or grill, I used my Nuwave oven.  I loaded up fries on the top and burgers on the bottom.  With the fat dripping away, it was a little healthier.  I also used Velvetta Cheese, and I added onion soup mix.  The flavor was awesome!  The kiddos enjoyed them as well.  Update - I had some frozen cheddar cubes that I used, and I didnt add any other extra ingredients in an effort to save $ here and there, and they were very good.

I seasoned my burger meat how I normally do with the french onion soup mix, then added the worch & pepper.  I put a slice of american cheese between each & sealed them.  they started to seap out as I was cooking them....must not have sealed them tight enough!  I cooked them in bbq sauce...they were delicious....just wish the cheese didn't fall out!  Will defininitly make them again!

When I looked at this recipe the first time, I thought how can putting american cheese in the middle taste any better than putting it on top of the burger? But I tried it anyways, and it was DELICIOUS!! I used two little squares in the middle instead of one and made my burgers a little thicker and they were so juicy & cheesy in middle. I'll make my burgers like this for now on!

My mom and grandparent's used to take us to Matt's for Juicy Lucys....they're STILL a hands-down favorite!!  You MUST use American cheese to get anything close.  Although living in Alaska now, I'm going to try them with caribou meat.  Can hardly wait to make 'em.  Thanks for the reminder of a childhood fave!

Okay, I can't leave well enough alone and changed this, but they were delicious!  I mixed yellow mustard and sweet relish in with meat mixture, cooked them on the grill with a bit of bbq sauce served on potato rolls.  SO SO GOOD and super juicy!

I do love these as is, but because of blood pressure issues, I do change the garlic salt to garlic powder.  And since then, I have tried all kinds of things in the center.  Crumbled bacon with swiss cheese and mushrooms, my husband likes this one alot as well as feta cheese and bacon or jalapenos and cheese.  Lots of fun to try different things!

I love a good Juicy Lucy and this hit the spot. Made exactly as written and my only complaint was that I longed for more Worcestershire sauce in these, which I'll double in this recipe next time. Overall, the flavor was very good for being so simple. I had no problems sealing the patties together--no cheese escaped! I treated us to 85% lean gr. beef to make these instead of our usual leaner ground beef. I melted an extra slice of cheese on top of the burgers and sauteed onions and mushrooms to go on my burger. I also had lettuce and tomato on my burger and a little mustard. My husband opted to use bbq sauce+mayo+ketchup mixture on his along with lettuce and tomato. This recipe is simple, easy to make, tasty, and very filling (you'll yield about 1/3 lb burgers). Thanks for the recipe--we'll definitely be making these again!

Definitely use 80/20 ground beef and the fresher the better.   We've made these twice now and I wouldn't change a thing!   They're so delicious.  We also topped them with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  The kids just use ketchup and pickles.

My husband and I loved this. 
I used only used a pound of 20% ground beef, added 2 Tbsps catsup, 1/3 cup finely chopped red onion, and outdoor grilled them.  Never thought burgers would turn out that juicy and delicious.   Great easy recipe.

The only thing I did different was to put the cheese on top to melt it. My buddy made them and said he lost some cheese while making them so I didn’t take the chance. I’m sure it didn’t change the taste at all which was , by the way, delicious. Great way to do burgers.

I'm fortunate to live near one of the restaurants that claims to have invented the juicy lucy. By comparison this is a good copy. I thought that the Worcester sauce taste was too strong. The second time I cut the Worcester sauce in half, and I liked it better.

I didn't change it at all and it was delicious.  I usually use ground turkey and believe they will be just as tasty.  I will try them that way next time.  I was surprised I didn't have a cheesy mess, I guess I pinched the edges together just right.
Good Stuff!

I really liked this burger! I do think that it needs some adjusting though. I don't think that it needs nearly as much pepper and I would do at least 2 pieces of cheese per pattie. Otherwise, a wonderful dish! I served it to my daughter and she really liked it!

Garlic powder, salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar to season.  Sharp Cheddar and Munster cheese makes a better flavor(my familys favorite).  But choose the cheese that suits your tastes buds then you will have a great burger!  I also dont pile it in the center, I normally shred or grate my own cheese fresh and mix it into the meat before making them into pattys.  That way there is cheese through and through.  Then of course a slice of sharp cheddar on top!

These were juicy and delicious. Made on the grill, 5 minutes per side over medium high heat. Cheese stayed inside of burger perfectly and was a creamy delight when taking a bite of the burger.

Next to try when I BBQ. I have been adding grilled onions to the middle but had never thought of cheese. Adding Garlic Salt and Worcestershire Sauce makes my mouth water as well.

I call these stuffed burgers and have been making these for over 30 years. I don't put in the Worcestershire sauce because I just do not care for it. Instead I put a thin slice of onion in them or mushrooms and Swiss cheese is good, too. I also wrap bacon around the sides for a bacon cheese burger. The main thing is to make sure the sides are pressed together really well and there are not air pockets in the middle.

I despise processed American "Cheese", so I use natural Swiss instead. I, too, add sauteed onions and mushrooms.

Would have rated higher but American cheese??  Come on!
Any other sharp cheese would be good.  Been making these for several years now and 1/4 to 3/8 " thick meat for each side.  When grilling, when the cheese starts to evacuate the burger, the burger is done!

I tweaked it a little bit to give it an Italian flair, so it is more likely to be named a Juce Luce. Italian seasoning a bit of marinara in the meat and mozzarella and pepperoni inside and outside as well. Wanted to serve 'em in parmesan thyme buns but just bought Puerto Rican bread to make sure it would hold this beauty. A homemade pesto mayo on the bread and grilled to italianize it too. Worth the work and hope to make them again soon. 
Either the original recipe or mexicanize it just for the challenge.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. My children loved the burgers.  The only problem was the cheese was leaking although I did try to fix patties. Doesn't matter I will perfect it by making it again. Overall quick easy and delicious.

Flavor was a bit spicy.  Next time I'll try cutting the pepper by half.  I also didn't care for the extra tangy flavor of worchestershire.    Next time I will hold the sauce.

We made these burgers tonight, they are heavenly. We used cheddar in the middle (and on top). They were so moist and amazing. We will definitely do this again and again!

Fantastic. Followed recipe as written. Very delicious. The processed cheese could be sub'd for cheddar, but it won't give that 'to die-for salty processed artery clogging melt in your mouth taste'.  Sometimes u gotta go for taste.

I make these every so often. My middle son and his friends love these burgers. I season them with a little seasoning salt too (or hamburger seasoning) and fry them in a pan. So good. Love the gooey middle! Use thousand island, sautéed onions, and pickles to top them. Thanks!!

Seems like a winner.  The whole family loved it.  I did have trouble making the patties thin enough, so my burgers were pretty thick.  I also must not have crimped enough because while they cooked the patties re-separated and we lost a bit of cheese out the sides.  In any case they were still very tasty and we intend to make them again.

Loved the seasoning with these burgers; we did use about a teaspoon of crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, as the worcestershire is usually salty enough.  Made with American and a spicy pepper-jack cheese and both were excellent.

Excellent as is and easy to customize. The second time around I added an egg and some red pepper flakes. Topped with a thin piece of Brie and served on an onion roll with a mayo, siricha & coffee ground aiole (chef john). Will never make a burger the old way again! Thx for the recipe :-)

OMG, this is the best burger I have ever cooked!  I did cut fat a bit by using 97% lean beef, and had 2 pounds to use, so upped the ingredients accordingly then followed the recipe.  Got 6 huge burgers out of this.  I do have to say that a little warning on the "taste explosion" factor that coated my chin, fingers, shirt, etc. would have been nice, but didn't decrease the flavor.  ;-)  Served with Kumato tomato, lettuce, avocado, and assorted other toppings.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Would have never found this one on my own-- did a search for most popular burger and this was one of them.  On a side note, I did put the patties down on parchment and rolled them very thin with a rolling pin, then put the cheese in the middle, rolled up the edges and pressed it back to a uniform thickness so these would cook all the way through.

I was wanting to make my favorite burger only to discover that I was out of ground beef. Still wanting to make some kind of burger I found that I had some Johnsonville mild Italian sausages and thought I'd give them a makeover. I removed the casing from the sausages and formed the ground sausage meat into thin patties, just like the "Juicy Lucy's" and used mozzarella cheese in place of the American cheese. These were great. Next BBQ gathering I will make both the ground beef and the ground sausage.

Loved them, nice and easy to make, didn't have worch. sauce, used about 2 tbsp bottled steak spice, chopped garlic clove, salt & pepper, formed into meat patties, and put them under the broiler for about 10 mins.  melted cheese on top.  Kids loved them!  delicious!!   :)  thanks!

This was OK, I think if I had used the mushrooms and onions as suggested it would have been more interesting.  But then why not just saute them and put on top of the cheeseburger? This is good if you love double the meat, which I don't. Maybe its just me.................

These were good, but nothing that stands out enough for me to make this my go to recipe for burgers. We did enjoy them.
