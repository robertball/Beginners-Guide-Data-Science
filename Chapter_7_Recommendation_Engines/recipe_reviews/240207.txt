This is pretty much how we always make our green bean casserole (sometimes using canned, frozen beans too, depending on what I have at the time). I typically mix my cheese into the beans and soup mixture, but followed instructions for this one. My family ate it happily - easy, cheesy, and creamy.

I cooked green beans that were fresh more like twenty minutes.  I also used a white cheddar cheese.  I cooked 30 minutes without the grinch onion topping and then added the topping at my final destination and Cooke 5 -10 minutes more.  I mixed the green beans,cheese and condensed soup all together for the bottom layer.  Delicious

The fresh beans add a flavor I couldn't get with the canned ones.  Four pounds of beans seemed like way too much until I snipped ends off and the amount was just right.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I also used it for leftover Thanksgiving cottage pie and it was still delicious after being frozen for a couple of months.

Made this variation of traditional green bean casserole with the cheese on Easter.  My husband isn’t a big fan of GBC, but the cheese addition made him a believer!  Fresh green beans are a must.  The only other thought I had is some crumbled bacon.  I will try that next time around.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

As other reviewers said, this was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. It truly was. It was soooooooo easy and delicious. It was a nice way to change up the regular boiled green beans we usually have. Even the kids liked it because of the cheese. I followed the directions exactly as written. You can't screw this up. Thank you for making me look like a star!

Made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit! The fresh green beans really make a difference. Four pounds seemed like a lot, but worked out perfectly after they were trimmed and cut. The only thing that I did different was mixing the cheese in with everything. I would definitely make this again!

Oh man, this was such a hit at Thanksgiving. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it came out great. The only slight problem was that at 30 minutes in the oven, some of the french fried onions burned, but I was able to take those off and replace with additional (I had bought two containers because I knew I was going to snack on some while I was cooking :-) ). So maybe keep an eye on it a few minutes early to check for the top burning. 

Otherwise, it was perfect. The green beans were still slightly crispy and really had a much better flavor than using the canned beans.

Just like Mom used to make!!!  Had to use frozen beans as that was all I had.  Shredded my own cheddar.  Delicious
