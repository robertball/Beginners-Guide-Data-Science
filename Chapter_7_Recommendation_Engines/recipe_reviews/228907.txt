Awsome and easy. Serve with whatever you like but I love mustard with my corn dog. I made mine with toothpicks and cocktail weenies and they were gone in seconds. Next time I will have to double the batch to make sure I get more then one. Even better was the fact I used mini chedder cocktail weenies for that cheese flavor, its to die for!!!!! 2 thumbs up. Thank you!
