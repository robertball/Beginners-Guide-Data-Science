I sub’d Truvia for the sugar which worked out fine in case you want to use a sugar substitute.  Slow cookers are like microwaves, cooking temperatures vary widely.  Mine was done in about 3 hours, so I would caution you to keep an eye on your cooker so it doesn’t burn.  The pudding was rich, loaded with vanilla flavor, and very creamy.  Although I’m not a huge slow cooker fan, this is one recipe that I would  make again.

So easy and so delicious! I subbed Vanilla Soy Milk and did not add any additional vanilla. It was extra delicious with some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top.

First time and will be the last time.  Followed directions as written.  I've always made fluffy tapioca on the stove with constant watching and stirring and with care.  Always came out fantastic to eagerly awaiting children.  Folded beaten egg whites into the finished product.  Mouth watering.
Slow cooking just doesn't cut it.  No real control over the process.  I could have eaten Elmer's glue rather than what turned out.  Probably would have tasted better.

Made this tapioca pudding and loved the flavor and texture. Yes it takes a while but well worth the wait. I even add vanilla beans to add a bit more flavor and exquisiteness. Yum!

Very good!! All slow cookers are different.  Mine was done in about 4 hours. So creamy and delicious, and easy. You do need to make sure you stir every half hour to hour to break up the clumps.  Will definitely make again. I prefer it warm while my husband prefers it cold, but it's so good I'll eat it either way.

I’ve made this with regular tapioca pearls. I let them soak over night then make as usual. Just a suggestion if someone was wondering. I do prefer large tapioca pearls with my tapioca pudding.

Disaster!  I followed recipe and used good ingredients but it turned brown, you could see the eggs  did not mix in,  and it never set up. Had to throw it all out and was so looking forward to it.

My wife ate herself sick on it, my daughter loved it, but I did not enjoy the eggie taste. I think this means that I don't actually like tapioca pudding, not that there was anything wrong with the recipe!

Will definitely make again. Could decrease sugar a little bit if serving warm. A dash of cinnamon is nice! So easy made in slow cooker.
