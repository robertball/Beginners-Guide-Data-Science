I made these for a baby shower but chopped and blended all the ingredients together to make a spread and put onto tea sandwiches.  Very delicious!

These sandwiches, salad, and wedding soup comprised the menu for the bridal shower I gave for my friend.  The guests raved about these sandwiches!  The cream cheese spread has just the right amount of flavor...not overpowering, yet it enhances the cucumber.  And, DO soak them in the vinegar & water.  It makes such a wonderful taste in the end result.  

Time restrictions prohibited me from cutting shapes/olive flowers, so I used sourdough cocktail bread and sat the olives on top using cream cheese spread as "glue".  These are absolutely wonderful!  I would use this recipe for any type of gathering, from casual to formal.

I served these at a cocktail party and everyone really enjoyed them. 

I was running out of time before the guests would arrive, so instead of cutting the olives and arranging on the cucumber as described, I simply left them whole and skewered them to to the center of the sandwich with a toothpick. They were still very pretty and the toothpick made a nice handle. 

I will definitely make these again.

Not just a great appetizer -- I love the taste of this, even when I don't go to the trouble to use the olives.  I just keep containers of cucumbers in the vinegar/water mix and the cream cheese mixture in the fridge so I can throw together a sandwich anytime.  I don't even measure the ingredients, and it still comes out great.  Thanks for giving me another way to enjoy my garden cukes!   EDITED:  Recently made this again and wanted to put a greek spin on it, so added feta to the cream cheese mixture with a little greek seasoning and it was OUTSTANDING!!!

I recently made these for a bridal shower and they were a big hit.  As a variation, I chopped the olives and put them between the spread and cucumber (so the olives wouldn't fall out).  I also used regular white bread (not thin sliced) and it was great! I made yummy sandwiches for myself with the leftover marinated cucumbers after the party was over!

I made this recipe for a wedding shower and it was a hit.  Instead of cutting the olive into wedges I secured it with a cocktail tootpick.  Many guests asked for the recipe.

Great recipe!  Only changes I made were I used sourdough cocktail bread and celery salt instead of onion salt- they were a hit at a Mojito party!  Also, the cocktail bread held up well after I made these the morning of the party.

Awesome! I did 2/3 apple cider vinegar and 1/3 white vinegar, but went exactly by recipe for the rest. Thanks for this easy delicious recipe.

These are wonderful!  I made them for a school function (after my husband told me that no one would eat cucumber sandwiches!) and they were gone within minutes!  The only change I made was to chop up the olives in a food processor and mix them into the cream cheese mixture.  They were easier to transport this way.  These are the best cucumber sandwiches I've ever had!

This is my new favorite sandwich.  I did not marinate the cucumber and added more worchestershire, garlic powder and onion salt to the cream cheese and mayo.  I used both potato bread and sourdough... both were equally delish!

Made these for the opening night of a play my mother directed. I used a sliced baguette that I toasted lightly in the oven. It went over huge, one of the few appetizers on the table that completely disappeared.

My daughter made this for her 4H county Food Show and won 1st Place and will be going to district with it.  She also made it for her 4th grade class, they loved it!!!  She made it into a Nutritious Snack and substituted the bread for high fiber, whole wheat bread and used fat-free mayonnaise and cream cheese.  And the 4th graders still loved it!!!  I recommend that you toast the bread, though.  The bread gets stale if you don't serve it immediately.

I made these slightly differently. I left out the olives and mixed all the other ingredients into a spread. I sliced and soaked the cucumbers as directed. To make the sandwiches, I spread the cream cheese mixture on both pieces of bread, layered the  cucumbers in the middle, and sprinkled paprika. I sliced the sandwiches diagonally for little triangles. I took them to a potluck and everyone raved! They ate every last one! Try them this way if you're going to a casual event like a picnic or barbeque.

Very good. I served these at a party & they were devoured. I did chop the olives & put them right into the cream cheese.

I have been making these for about 2 years now. I am asked to bring these to every gathering I go to. I think they are ok, but my friend love them. So simple! I don't do the olive topping  but still yummy. THank You Sara.

I didn't really like these.  I'm not quite sure what it was, most likely the vinegar.  Also, having soft bread is not a good mix with the cream cheese and crunchy cucumber.

I don’t feel this is a memorable appetizer. Yes it was good but nothing special. Instead of going through the trouble you can purchase any spreadable flavored cream cheese. This recipe is all about the presentation not really the ingredients. I toasted the bread lightly, but after a while they get soggy. I wouldn’t bother with this again but it’s good for beginners.

Made these for a church reception.  I used colored bread in pink, yellow, and green ordered from a bakery. I used mini-cucumbers and a small circle cutter just larger than the cucumber slices to cut the bread.  I piped the spread onto the bread from a bag with the corner snipped.  Hold the stuffed olives firmly between the thumb and forefinger to cut neat slices quickly.  I used the stuffed olive circles on top of the cucumbers.  I scattered leaves cut from the green bread among the sandwiches on the tray to make it resemble flowers.  They assembled quickly.  A big hit!

I have made these for several years. I have made them for Boutiques, Baby showers, wedding showers. Everytime I am amazed how much people love these! I have made them on all different breads but the best I have found is on Croissants.
