This was PERFECT! I only used the cookie recipe and not the icing, but I could not have been happier with it! The dough fit perfectly into my cookie pan (it was bigger than 9 inch but more shallow) and baked up beautifully. Everyone loved it! A definite keeper-yum! Thanks for sharing

I made this recipe with gluten-free flour using two 6" cake pans rather than the 9".  I baked them for 20 minutes.  I only used half of the frosting, using all butter, and I added cocoa to half of that frosting so I could pipe it in a decorative fashion.   I'm not sure what I would have done with the whole frosting recipe!  The middle of the final product was quite raw which will probably make my granddaughters happy!  I'm reviewing this before they taste it, so I'm just guessing how they would rate it.

This was pretty yummy and a nice change from regular cookies. We didn’t make the glaze because my kids wanted to use the cookie cake as more of a Pazookie (like you’d order at BJ’s Brewery) so after baking and cooking, I used the top of a glass to cut a perfect circle (couldn’t find my circle cookie cutter). Then each kid decorated the top of the cookie with ice cream on the side. So fun and it let the kids be creative.

I'm rating this 5 stars for the cake alone. It's perfect. Deliciously chewy, chocolately, and 100% what you want in a chocolate chip cookie. I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from some cinnamon rolls I made the day before, so I used that in place of the buttercream called for here (I only had about 3/4 cup frosting, and that was plenty). I would probably go with the cream cheese frosting again, because the flavor combo was killer! I also wanted to make this a 'funfetti' style chocolate chip cookie cake, so I reduced the white sugar to 1/8 of a cup, and added in 1/4 cup jimmy sprinkles. My cake needed 24 minutes to bake, and was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe.
