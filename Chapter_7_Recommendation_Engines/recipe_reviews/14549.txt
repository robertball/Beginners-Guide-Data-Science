These bananas are so good!  I put them in foil before I put them on the grill and they were great and no mess.  Thanks!

I made this recipe on a recent camping trip.  The only change I made was to put the bananas in a foil packet on the grill instead of directly on the grate (campsite fire-ring grate was pretty nasty looking).  The bananas were done perfectly, and by putting it in a foil pack, we had all the wonderful juices to use as a syrup over ice cream.  Even better, the few leftovers that were remaining, we used as a fruit topping to the "Baked French Toast" casserole (also on allrecipes)the next morning.  Delicious. Made the mess once, enjoyed it twice!!!  Will definitely make this again.

This dessert is awesome!  I've been making this for years now and I continue to get rave reviews on it.  I always make it in a pan and the goo that forms in the pan, I just pour over the bananas and ice cream as a topping! It's perfect.  I'm not sure why other reviews commented that it was messy.  I used granulated brown sugar - maybe that made the difference - but I didn't think it was messy at all.

The end product was delicious, however it is a little messy to prepare.  The recipe makes it sound very easy and mess free.  If you aren't careful the sugar will catch on fire.

I was home, alone with my 3 yr old twin sisters, who I had just gotten down for a nap. I was getting bored (imagine that!!)and thought i would surprise my family of 8 with a dessert. I found this one and made it on the skillet (med low heat). I was almost finished when one of the twins woke up.  She found my extra sugar and gobbled it down (not without a mess at her feet)!!! So i started cleaning up when the other twin woke up by then and together, both of them found the finished bananas!!! In the end...my family enjoyed all of the bananas after dinner (minus three or four...)

Wow, you'll definitely eat a "Bellyful" of these! If you love grilled fruit, you'll love this. This is a great ending to any BBQ meal.  I did add a splash of vanilla.  This was so easy and produced great results.  I drizzled a little rum over top when they came off the grill and served with vanilla ice cream and the extra cinnamon/sugar - YUMMY! Next time I might take it up a notch and add some toasted coconut and whipped cream...

I made this is a pan over the grill. Wow! This was a wonderfully tasty surprise. It reminds me of Bananas Foster. Loved it with vanilla bean ice cream but his would probably taste good with chocolate too! I will try that next time. WTG Charlie!!

We made these when bbq'ing with friends (adults and kids).  Not only were they fairly easy and absolutely delicious served hot over vanilla ice cream... but they were also a fun conversation piece because who has ever heard of grilled bananas?!?  

Because we'd read that this can get messy, we left the banana in the peel and cut it in half lengthwise.  We put the sugar/cinn mixture on the cut side only.  Grilled it first on the peeling side until the banana was soft and the topping was melted.  We flipped it over and cooked the cut side briefly just to leave grill marks.  (yes.. that part is  a bit messy.)  

Do not use overripe bananas; the texture is "off."  Use barely ripe because they are firm and easier to handle.

I made these for a few friends on a dinner party we had but i changed it quite a bit. First off i did dip the bananas in lemon juice then dipped them in a brown sugar cinnamon cocoa powder mix. I pan fried them in a skillet with a little unsalted butter and as frying them put in some rum as well. Then made some home made whipped cream and served them both with some vanilla ice cream. They were amazing. Sort of a new twist on banana foster.

I loved this!!! It was an easy and unique dessert. I made enough for 6 people and all loved it..when cooking your banana's, be careful not to overcook.  3min each side, low heat was perfect.

This was delicious. I do suggest that you use small aluminium trays to put these in and you can serve it right inside...I will be making this over and over.

Absolutely delicious. Can't be fully enjoyed without the vanilla ice-cream. My six year old was thrilled with everything from preparing them to cooking them to eating them.

To make it less messy, I don't peel the banana but instead cut it in half length-wise and then grill flat side down.  Peel before eating.

Very tasty! And easy to do. Probably just as easy on a skillet but if the grill is already going then go for it.

Great for kidz, but take it up a notch!  I have done this for years. When you split the banana, throw in chocolate chips, coconut, nuts, chocolate syrup, caramel or anything else you like.  (not too much, but like a sundae, use what you like)  Then, grill as usual!  You'll have to eat with a spoon, but SOOO YUMMY and the kidz love to put their own ingredients/toppings in themselves! (:

SO YUMMY! I used butter and a pan to fry it in. I let the butter melt, and then I put the bananas in with high heat. I put them in for only about 45-60 seconds per side. This kept the bananas from getting gooey! If you let them cook to long, they get all mushy and loose their banana taste

First time we tried a BBQ dessert and it was a big hit.  It is important to use just ripe bananas or they would be too difficult to work with.  We might try cutting them into chunks next time and putting them on skewers.

Wow..!! This was amazing. Zen-like. I wasn't too sure what to think at first, but I gave it a try and it was to die for!

Certainly messy though! I sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon over the bananas after the lemon on a plate instead of rolling them in the mix. This resulted in a caramel goo that was then delicious poured on top of the vanilla ice-cream! I also sprinkled a dash of cinnamon and chopped pecans (or walnuts would be good) on top as well, which gave a delicious crunch! I think next time I might try this on BBQ broiler pans as the goo on the grill is hard to clean off and prone to catching fire...

I made this for my picky eaters.  They thought it was great.  I put the ice cream on the bananas and topped the ice cream with cinimmon.  They wanted seconds. We put these in a fish rack this made them easier to turn and remove. This also kept the bananas from coming apart.

Whoa, Charlie! This is goood. We put the bananas in foil like other reviewers did, and the sauce left behind was thick and delicious. We added 1 tbsp of spiced rum to the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Can't believe how easy this was.

Very good, I used nutmeg and cinnamon and added a bit of rum to mimic bananas foster.  Also I cooked this in an aluminum foil pack on the grill.

Holy cow! So good! I made this on the stove (even though I prefer grilling) and it turned out amazing. I have also added unsweetened coconut flakes and semi-sweet choc chips which also turned out delicious. Better than many restaurant desserts!

not a bad little dessert if you have plenty of bananas... very sweet and cooked bananas are always delicious... the bananas by themselves are also good if you don't want to serve over ice cream... fairly easy to make for your next barbecue

Pretty good.  I used the stove top because we had already turned off the grill.  I liked how the coating got crispy when it hit the ice cream.  I may make this again, it was good - but didn't knock my socks off.

ah-mazing. whoa. Out of left field, I wasn't sure what to expect, but these are such a treat. I made this recipe for our cinco de mayo party and have made three times since then. People don't know what to expect when you say "now for dessert, barbequed bananas". but everyone so far has had nothing but raves. I know I personally love it! Fabulous!

Once you roll them in the sugar they are very fragile and I could see how the grill would get pretty messy so I used the foil technique.  I was expecting them to crisp up but they never did so I was disappointed.  I served with whipped topping and nuts instead of ice cream.  My guests seemed to enjoy it but I don't think I'll make this one again.

This was the BIG surprise of our "all grilling" night.  I'll be honest, I've never been either a big banana fan NOR found the thought of fruit on the grill appealing.  BUT . . . had to give it a try.  This easily tied for one of the best two dishes of the night.  EVERYONE loved it will vanilla ice cream and even though I made extra, we had NONE left over!

Regarding the comment about the sugar catching on fire: sugars we cook with carbonize at about 350 degrees and the combustion point is above that. Most recipes calling for low heat would be well below that -- 225 to 250 or so. If you're having trouble with the sugar bursting into flames, you probably have your grill set way too high.

Extremely simple and delicious. I used slightly under ripe bananas so that they would be a little more manageable on the grill. The sugar mixtures sweetens them adequately.

This was pretty darn good. We weren't too sure about it at first - but it's tasty, and goes great with the vanilla ice cream. I cooked mine in a skillet with some butter. Thanks.

These bananas were a big hit with the kids.  I did cook them on the stove with a little butter.  You just have to watch that you don't cook too long...they get very soft very quick!

This worked out really well. I grilled them in a foil packet. I also didn't put a cup of brown sugar... maybe 1/2 cup at most. The bananas still came out well and were still sweet. Will be using this again.
