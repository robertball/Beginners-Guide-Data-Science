Oh my goodness, so good!  I made it exactly as written except for the salad part.  I didn't have arugula nor any salad at the time, so I used rice instead, and drizzled the dressing over it and it was terrific!  This recipe was easy and so quick to prepare.  I can make it during the work week with no problem.

I happened to have apricot infused balsamic vinegar and used that. That is the only thing I did differently and only because I have it, why not use it. This is amazing! I am saving it and will make it again.

We liked this! I substituted spinach for the arugula, because that's what I had on hand. The sauce is really delicious, and I think this would be really good served on a bed of rice as well, with some of the sauce drizzled over top.

5 stars all the way! The glaze is absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  My salmon pieces were 6oz each, but the stated 1 1/4" thickness and the cook time was perfect.  I could probably get away with making half the amount of dressing for the arugula - personal preference. The use of arugula adds a nice peppery contrast to the sweetness of the salmon. A simple recipe, yet it would make an impressive meal for company. I'll be making this often!
