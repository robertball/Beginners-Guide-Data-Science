A delicious meaty macaroni dinner that's easy to make.  I add real shredded cheese and I add more than 2 cups because my family can never get enough cheese.  You can make it as cheesy as you like.  Sometimes, I boil the macaroni separately and add it to the beef mixture to which I omitt the water.

Very easy to make.  If you use lean meat (90%), you don't need to drain it.  I also added fresh celery to the mix.  You could add whatever fresh vegetables that you like.  If I make it again, I will likely add some black pepper and substitute pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick.  Very good and the whole family will like it.

So quick and easy and very tasty! I had to use onion powder because no onions in the house. Other than that I did use mild cheddar and it turned out great!

This has become one of my picky husband's favorites next to beef enchiladas.  I used the Rotel diced tomatoes and greenchilies Mild. used garlic flavored olive oil instead and for water I used beef broth. but I'm sure you can use or vegetable broth also. Since I like it cheesy I  added another 1/2 cup shredded mild cheddar.  PS my pug Lola also loves it! Hubby heats up leftovers in the AM for breakfast topped with over easy eggs!

We used marinara instead of the tomatoes and shredded cheddar. Increase the pasta to make the beef go farther. 1 cup of vegetable broth for each cup of dry pasta.

I made this tonight with a few twists. I used salt pepper and garlic while frying the chop meat. I used Rotel  diced tomatoes and chili’s (it’s all I had on hand). After I added the pasta I melted 1/2 a large block of velveeta and mixed it in. My husband (who usually eats very healthy) loved this and my son who’s home from college couldn’t get enough.

To use leftover macaroni and fresh ground beef, I added onion, celery and green pepper. With this recipe, I found out all I need to do is add cheese, I will use American and a couple other cheeses I have on hand. With a side of broccoli, this will be dinner tonite.

Quick and super easy to prepare.  Reminds me of a dish my mom served when I was a kid, so it was nostalgic as well.

This is easy, quick, and a meal my family liked--just what I was looking for.  I thought 1 cup of pasta for 8 servings was ridiculous, so I added 2 1/2 cups of pasta (I used whole-grain penne as I didn't have macaroni)and then 2 1/2 cups of water.  I added a couple of beef bouillon cubes, salt, pepper, onion powder, and dried minced garlic.  I added a combination of cheddar and American cheeses (I added 2 1/2 cups of cheese) I even added some left over
homemade nacho sauce which made it extra creamy.
