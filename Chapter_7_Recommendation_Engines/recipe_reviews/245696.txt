I LOVE cheesecake of all kinds, and this was no exception! This is a denser/heavier cheesecake, so just keep that in mind. This was very easy to put together and looked so pretty  when it was done (though mine did crack a bit). I served each piece with a drizzle of chocolate sauce, whipped cream and additional crushed peppermint candies. This would be wonderful for any winter gathering, or just anytime you want a quick and easy, but very tasty cheesecake, which is why I made it, lol! I will def be making this again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a real disappointment.   The recipe says to press the cookie crumb and margarine into the bottom (not up the sides) of the spring form pan but when cutting the first piece it was almost impossible to get off the pan bottom.  The taste of the cake itself was like peppermint flavored cream cheese.  Not my kind of cheese cake.  Debbie

Easy to make and was tasty, but I didn't care for the gelatinous texture.  I prefer baked cheesecake, but the kids did enjoy this.

Cheesecake soup. Recipe is wrong, I followed it exactly, it is soup, and even if it worked, there are not enough ingredients to fill my spring foam pan.

I had to improvise on the crust because I couldn’t find the chocolate cookie crumbs.  I bought an Oreo pie crust and  smashed it into crumbs, then added the butter and patted it onto the bottom of my springform pan.  I stuck pretty close to the rest of the recipe except for adding a teaspoon of peppermint extract.  I wanted more peppermint flavor.  It didn’t firm up as much as I would have liked and it was difficult to serve.  I don’t think I’ll try it again.

This dessert recipe didn’t disappoint! I used an Oreo cookie crust, added 1/4 tsp peppermint extract, and 2 cups of whipped cream instead of 1. I topped it with peppermint chocolate pieces, crushed candy cane pieces and chocolate syrup. It was very easy and didn’t take long to make.
