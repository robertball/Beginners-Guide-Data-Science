Instead of using the canned apple pie filling, I sliced 2 peeled granny smith apples and 1 onion, sauteed them after browning the pork chops. I also added 1 mince clove of garlic, fresh rosemary, thyme and just a hint of cinnamon. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I used Savory Herb Stovetop Stuffing and it was excellent! The fresh apples with the onion made it very flavorful without it being too sweet. My husband loved it. By using fresh ingredients instead of the canned apple pie filling, it was a very elegant dish. A keeper!

I made this recipe tonight for my family and my husband and I really liked it.  I've been hesitant to make pork chops because they are always tough.  I searched for a different way to cook the meat and this worked!  The pork was so tender and I loved the apple filling layered with the stuffing.  I will make this again!

YUM!!! We were almost licking the pan.  I didn't have apple pie filling, so I made some with apples, cinnamon sugar, butter, and a little cornstarch/water slurry.  Seasoned the chops with sage, salt & pepper before browning.  Made some Stuffing mix using the stove top directions.  My husband loves gravy, so I mixed up a packet of pork gravy for the side.  So good!  Can't wait to make it again!   
** Edited to add..... I purchased the pork tenderloin twin pack from Costco.  Each pack has two tenderloins,  I cut it into 1-1/2 in thick medallions  WOW!  Amazing.  I also poured about a 1/4 cup of gravy over the top before baking.  I make it in a loaf pan since it's just for me and my husband.  THANK YOU for such a great recipe!

This was very easy to make.  I agree with some readers that the pork chops were a little bland.  Next time I will rub the chops with seasoning salt and then brown them.  I also used more than the recommended amount of apple filling and was glad I did.  Very good and moist.

Very easy to make, and everyone in the family ate it up!  The chops were tender, which I usually have trouble with.  Next time I think I will add an extra can of apple pie filling and an extra box of stuffing for the top.  Simple and delicious!

This is a really good quick and easy recipe. I just seasoned pork with salt and pepper, added cinnamon (my apples didn't come with it) and a little extra sugar to the apples.  Gave it a nice sweet and salty taste with the stuffing. Definitely a keeper for me!

Excellent recipe with one change: use fresh apples and follow the suggestions provided by Mrs. K.  (Add onion, garlic, thyme, rosemary and a touch of cinnamon to the apples to make them more savory than sweet.)  I'll be making this again!

I rated this 4 of 5 stars because I prefer to not use StopTop. I based my dressing off of the Slow Cooker Stuffing recipe found here on Allrecipes.com (bake it in the oven instead of the slow cooker).  It isn't complicated or time consuming and the flavor is SO much better. And I agree to season the pork chops a little when browning.

My family absolutely LOVED these pork chops!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  I used Sage Stuffing and added a little additional sage in the stuffing and used salt and pepper on the chops before browning.

I will definitely make this again. One big change I may make is to mix in a little apple in with the stuffing mix. just to add that surprise kicker. The stuffing and apples taste amazing together which is why I wan to do that.  I liked the apple pie filling idea I would consider though maybe using some apple sauce to cut sweetness if you need.

We really liked the recipe.  Used same quantity of everything except, only two good size thick chops.  Added onion powder and cinnamon to chops while browning.  Mixed ingredients in baking dish half way through baking.  For 6 chops, I would triple ingredients. Makes for a main dish with a side.

This was as easy as advertised, and delicious, too! I had extra pork chops, so I did one pan with sliced, green apples (skip the processed and over sugared pie filling) and a second one with sliced onion. I made a gravy to with it, but it was perfectly moist.

My family absolutely loved this dinner. They all like different types of food, but in this case I was surprised that they all loved it. The pork was very juicy and flavorful. I used apple sauce.

I used seasoned tenderloin medallions and they turned out nice and tender. I liked the idea of the apple pie filling, pork, and stuffing; however I didn’t like the stuffing and filling together. If I make this again, I’ll leave the stuffing separate. Thanks!

One can of pie filling and one box of stuffing mix wasn't really enough to fill a 9x13" pan properly. I ended up combining a can of premium pie filling and a can of fried apples for the bottom layer, then layering the stuffing over the chops. While I like all the ingredients, they didn't seem to have any magic together. Thanks for sharing the recipe, though!

I used chicken stuffing because that’s what I had in the pantry and had low sugar apple filling.  Super easy and delicious.  Everyone had seconds.

I made this using apple pie filing from the can (I cut the apples in half using a spoon once they were in the greased pan); I added a little brown sugar over the tops of the apples and baked them while I fried the seasoned pork chops. I placed the cooked pork chops atop the apples and covered them while I cooked a few more pork chops and began cooking the stove top stuffing for pork. Once the last pork chops and stuffing were done I put the last chop over the apples and finally added the stuffing evenly and covered and baked them for a few more minutes. really glad I made this dish...may be something I will cook for the holidays

I made it kinda.  I did use fresh apples and onions, but otherwise followed recipe.  Very flavorful.  Served with mashed potatoes and fresh broccoli.  lovely meal.  This recipe is actually something in my family for over 50 yrs though.  I cant imagine using pie filling though.

This is so easy. I use plain apple pie filling though, I dont care for cinamon with it too much. 3 ingredients (besides what stuffing calls for ). They are juicier if cooked with the bone in the pork. Delicious either way! Finger licking good!!

This fell short of expectations for us. I liked it ok. My husband hated it, but both of my kids ate it. I think this dish would be better with the apples, pork chops and stuffing cooked separately.

I found this recipe looking for something different. I happened to have all the ingredients and decided to give it a go. I’m SO glad I did!!!  The flavors blended beautifully!! Even my picky eaters loved it!  The only thing I did differently was I made homemade stuffing.  I would make no other changes and the kids are asking when I’ll make it again!  It’s a WIN!

I, too added a peeled, diced granny smith apple, some chopped fresh baby spinach, and a touch of cinnamon in place of the apple pie filling to keep it a little healthier/fresher. I also threw in about 5 diced seedless red grapes that I had on hand. I sliced (to create stuffing pockets), salted and peppered the sautéed pork chops before stuffing them, then just placed the rest of the stuffing in the casserole around the stuffed chops. They’re in the oven now. I’m pretty sure they’re going to be a hit. I’ll be back to let you know

I tried this recipe as written the first time.  The pork chops were very bland but it was good.  The second time, everything turned out amazing with a few changes.  I seasoned both sides of each pork chop with season salt and dried thyme and browned them with diced fresh garlic cloves.  I used a 21 oz can of apple pie filling (sliced apples) and I used generic pork chop stuffing.  Wow!  This time it was outstanding and everyone really loved it.  Just a couple of tweaks made this good recipe so much better.

I have made this three times now...i use sage and cornbread stove top together (double the water and a touch more butter) and my family has loved it with this change! Seared the chops with olive oil, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning...quick, easy, and most of all, tasty!!!

I used fresh apples and didn't add anything to them for a fresh touch. I also used the turkey flavored stuffing I had on hand (I prefer it as it's a little more salty and flavorful than pork flavor). I also lightly salted and peppered the chops prior to searing. I used thick chops and am pleased they cooked all the way through and were surprisingly tender! I would gladly make it again!

My hubby really enjoyed it. Me and my son found the flavours very confusing, and slightly mushy. I'm glad I tried it. Sounded so interesting. It was eatable, just no "wow factor"to it.

My husband and I loved this recipe!!! The only changes I made were to the seasoning of the chops themselves - I used salt, black pepper, garlic salt and onion powder AND I didn't have any apple pie filling on hand so I used glazed carrots (butter, brown sugar and maple syrup, pinch of salt and pepper) slightly mashed as the base to put the pork chops on...threw some seasoned green beans onto our plates and we were good to go!!! So, I guess I tweaked over the main part, but  the entire concept is great and the next time I will definitely use the pie filling!! Great comfort food and for anyone who loves casseroles like my husband!!

I only made two chops so adjusted the recipe to suit.  I also used my Cast Iron Skillet.  Loved the chops, very tender, and juicy.  Apples and pork are always  good combo.

Substitute Queen: I used 2 chops, trimming fat and browning in olive oil, then sliced; used 1 fresh granny smith apple; half a box of grocery store boxed stuffing mix with requisite water and butter, but added 1  - 4 oz can of mushrooms, 1/3 yellow onion and celery chopped and lightly  browned in olive oil.   Added the sliced tart apples as well and 1/4 c white balsamic vinegar.
layered all in a pan in 350 oven.  cover 30 min. then 10 without. 
Absolutely wonderful!!

No changes except sometimes I put pork chops on top of stuffing because I forget the steps.  Made this recipe at least six times and always perfect.  Chops turn out moist and tender and I usually have a problem with them being that.  This is safe and perfect for family and company too.  On my regular meal list.  We love it

I don;t cook much my husband does almost all the cooking. So always trying to find something quick! This is a great meal and my husband and son love it. I even had the grocery store grill the pork chops while I was grocery shopping. I like to use  thicker porkchop. Delicious have made at least 4 times and having tonight. Perfect food for a cold Chicago night!

I used thicker butterfly pork chops and a sage stuffing mix.  The granny smith apples I used didn't hold their shape and turned into applesauce.  It tasted good and was very filling.  I may make it again with some minor adjustments.  It needed a bit more cinnamon.  For the most part, I followed Mrs.  K's suggestions and sautéed a clove of garlic with the onion.

I have made this twice for my family and it is a hit! We always made the same type of pork chops with cream of mushroom soup. I wanted the change things up and stumbled upon this recipe. I made my own apple pie filling and used corn bread stuffing.  It comes out so moist and all the flavor a just blend so well together. So glad I found this recipe!

I followed others suggestions and sautéed fresh apples and onions after sautéing the chops.  I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, ground mustard, and Mrs. Dash onion and herb seasoning. This is an excellent dish which will definitely be in our rotation!

After using allrecipes for years, I finally had to make an account to review this recipe! My husband, while not super picky, also doesn't rave about meals very often. This is one he raved about! It's so easy, but so delicious and comforting. My only complaint is that the pork is bland. Marinating with just salt and pepper and mustard powder overnight made it perfect.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! I made this tonight. I wasn't keen on using canned apple pie filling though. I used three Granny Smith apples to make my own apple pie filling ( recipe found on allrecipes.com ).  The tartness of the Granny Smith apples really made this dish! My husband and I loved it! I will definitely make it again.

The flavours of this recipe are awesome. I couldn't use stovetop or canned apples because I don't like them so I made the recipe this way:

The pork chops should be thicker - season with Salt and pepper & ground thyme. Heat up a frying pan, melt some butter and brown both sides of the meat. Be sure to season both sides.  I froze the meat after this. 
For the apples - it was one medium apple per pork chop. I peeled, sliced and fried in some butter with half an onion and some garlic. I seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Once they slightly browned I added a generous sprinkle of brown sugar and then put them in the baking dish. 
I made my own stuffing which was a slice of stale bread for each chop with some minced onion, celery, chicken stock, salt, pepper, garlic and a generous amount of sage. I added enough stock for the bread to form a ball and then put it on top of the frozen meat. I baked it uncovered at 350 for about an hour. It was really good.

I made this for dinner and the hubby and kids didn't like them to much, but mainly because they didn't like the sweetness of the apples.  I'm the type to eat pork chops with applesauce right on the chop, not my guys.  I thought they were excellent though!!!

I didn't have pie filling so I cut up an apple and added sugar, butter, and cinnamon and then added apple butter to it til it had a nice pie filling consistency. I seasoned my pork with minced garlic, salt, pepper and season all before browning it. I loved it! It was so tender and juicy! My husband liked it ok but he's not a fan of fruit with meat. I reheated it the next day and it was just as good if not better.

Other than substituting my canned apples, I followed the recipe to the T, and the pork drops were very dry.  I think if I had used much thicker pork chops, it would have turned out better.

Made this recipe last night for myself and the kids.  It was quick and easy to throw together after work.  We all really enjoyed it!  Had left overs for lunch today and it was just as good warmed up.

Family loved this recipe.  My little ones loved the stuffing and apples.   Works great for thick pork chops.

I've made this, exactly as it is written, in a slow cooker while we were at church this morning.  Everything is good except the pork chop, it was bland but the apple taste good with the chop and it was tender.  Read the review, next time I will season it while it browning.  Will make it again.

This was an incredibly easy and delicious meal.  I followed the advice of other reviewers to season the pork chops before browning, but followed everything else exactly. This will go into our regular rotation. Thanks!

Big hit with my kids, we all like it with cornbread stuffing and some baby carrots on the side. Easy enough for my 13-yr old to make on his own!

This was really tasty. I doubled the stuffing and the apples because we like a lot of both. Seasoned the chops with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder and served it with rice. Great Sunday dinner.

I didn't have the Apple Pie filling so I made my own.  Soooo good!  Will make this again, just as the recipe reads.  Very tender pork chops and that's saying something!

this was so easy to make. Even my 2 year old liked it and my 10 month old loved the apples and stuffing. This is a keeper!
