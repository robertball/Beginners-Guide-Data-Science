I am the author of this recipes and my directions did not say anything about putting this in a food processer.We like it chunky so we just cube the pork,add rest of ingredients and mix.Also i do NOT add vegetable oil and I use 1/4 tsp half salt optional and pepper to taste !

I don't keep Miracle Whip in the house, I used reduced fat mayonnaise instead. I also added some fresh ground pepper. This was tasty! I made four sandwiches for the husband and boys' lunch on whole wheat bread and I wrapped mine in pieces of lettuce as I'm eating low carb. The horseradish really gave it a kick, next time I'd cut it back just a touch for my boys but for me it was great! When I make this next time, I think I'll throw in some chopped pickles and more celery to make it stretch just a little farther.

I made this recipe in order to use up leftover pork chops that weren't as tender when originally cooked as I'd hoped. My husband seasoned the pork chops before cooking and I think that helped make this salad.  At any rate, he loved it! I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it but I'm delighted to have found yet another recipe on this site that's a winner!

I made this with homemade mayo, homemade fennel mustard and homemade relish! Used pulled pork tenderloin, added red pepper flakes, parsley, celery seed, and onion and garlic powder. Lots pf black pepper. Really tasty. Thinking of adding cream cheese to make it more spreadable or adding egg and bread crumbs to make pork patties, kind of like a crab cake. That makes me think of Old Bay seasoning...

Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe and easy. Now hoping to have leftover pork roast so I can make this. Lerie, I think you misread the directions. Only the sauce goes into the blender, not the cubed pork.

Wow, this is so good.  Although I had to double the amount of dressing to cover my ingredients.  Yum!

I followed recipe except  I used white onion bc I didn't have any green onion.  I let it meld for 4 hours...then one day and then two days and I didn't really enjoy it for any of these sandwiches. I did like it on crackers the first night.  I like all the ingredients, yet I just didn't fall in love with this as a salad, but it was nice on crackers.  Sorry but thanks for the ideas..

I like the idea of pork salad but I want to change the flavoring a bit. This recipe doesn't state which mustard to use. I used Dijon but didn't care for the taste. 

I cubed the roast pork I used and wonder if shredding it would be better?

This is delicious.  I didn’t have miracle whip , but used light olive oil mayo.  I mixed the sauce in my food processor, then added chunked pork, onions and celery to mix well ( I’m lazy).  Perfect way to use up the last bit of tenderloin.

We cooked a Boston Butt yesterday.  Today we make the salad.  While I really like green onions, many in my tribe do not especially the next day, so I left out the onions.  Regardless, it was delicious.  I've tried with saltines, other crackers and in a sandwich, but the best is just a salad on the side.  Hey, I put green onions on mine.  Really great!

I've made it twice and loved it both times. I tend to stray from recipes once I know it's good and then use them as guidelines. Used avo mayo, added tarragon, added black pepper. I love the spice in it!

I went to double the recipe because I had a ton of pork roast left from dinner. I didn’t have any celery on hand, so I omitted it.  I didn’t add any salt (my pork roast was cured and salty enough). Then, I mis-read the recipe and thought it called for 4Tbsp of Dijon mustard.  Needless to say, I screwed it up and it still turned out great!

This was a great tasting recipe for my leftover pork loin.
