So great! I cut up my okra and soaked in vinegar for 20 minutes, then rinsed. Not slimy at all after it cooked. In addition to the other spices, I added ~1T of garam masala and also quartered a few tomatoes and threw those in.

Very easy and would make it again. Remember NEVER wash fresh okra (that's what makes it slimy)

We "heart" this okra! It's also very good if you add a diced tomato and some chili powder. We've made this several times and you can subtitute olive oil or smart balance for the butter and it doesn't detract in any way.

Being from the South with okra very plentiful I am always looking for a new way to cook one of my favorite vegetables. I haven't been exposed to much Indian food,  so I was a little weary of the combination of spices. I went ahead and followed the recipe to a "T" and loved it! I was pleasantly suprised how the flavors bring out the sweetness of the okra. The only thing that I would change is that when using frozen okra, reduce the cooking time...it can get really mushy...I like my okra a little firm so that it holds its shape. Great recipe--thank you!

Fantastic!  My husband and I, being true Northern Yankees, never tried okra but we are now hooked!  So good it will be part of our holiday feasts!!  You can freeze this and then when ready to saute it, just dump it in a pan with lots of butter - just place fresh, chopped okra and all spices in a ziplock bag and throw in the freezer.  When ready to use, simply take straight from freezer and dump into a pan with hot butter and cook.  So easy!

I thought this was delicious and easy and vegetarian friendly. I did soak the okra in vinegar prior to cooking--this does reduce the slime

I increased all the amounts of spices slightly and it turned out tasty.  Despite what the other reviews said, I really think this tastes pretty authentic Indian - it's just like the "bhindi" (okra) my mom makes! Use fresh okra only though, or else it will be soggy.

I wasn't sure of this recipe, but I try it because my husband love Indian food. Not only did he loved it, my daugther who don't like orka gave it a try and actually like this dish. I didn't have any coriander so I use curry power instead and it turn out great! I will make agian.

This was nice change of how to make okra. I'm from the south so I'm used to it always being fried. Will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I used fresh okra and cooked a little more than 10 minutes.  I also added more spice.

Here's my version that is much tastier! 1. cut okra into thirds 2. heat fry pan on high add 1 tbsp of canola oil 3. when oil is hot add ora, toss after every minute or so until 'blackened' appearance. Reduce heat to Medium 4. add 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp of corriander. Toss 5. add 1/2 tsp salt, 2 chillies chopped and 2 cloves of garlic finely minced. toss for another minute 6. squeeze 1/3 juice of fresh lemon. Toss and serve This should take no longer than 8 minutes. DO NOT COVER FRY PAN UNLESS YOU WANT TO EAT BABY FOOD!

Unfortunately, my Indian husband did not like this dish at all.  I followed it exactly as stated...he said normally Indians prefer to have their okra deep fried in Besan (gram flour).  He suggested if I make this again; I should slice the okra length ways make a rub of the ingredients & smear it on the side that's cut open & fry in oil.  I also added garam masala for flavor....Lets see if making it his way makes a difference....

Yum! I'm not partial to ginger, so I subbed curry powder for it and added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne to a halved recipe. Spicy good! I tossed the spices in the pan before adding the okra. The heat works magic on spices. I used frozen okra, thawed and only had to cook the dish about 5 minutes after everything was in the pan. I added a little chicken bouillon powder before that simmer and served this with white rice. SO good! I can't wait to make this again.

Excellent! I love okra in all it's slimey goodness, fried, pickled, and even raw, but I've gotten a bit jaded about it. I almost pickled this bunch. I'm so glad I tried this recipe instead! I'm sending it to my Mom, and making it for our next family get-together. Wonderful flavor, fantastic texture, and a great change from the usual okra. I took it off the stove about five minutes early, mostly because it smelled too good to wait.   I stuck as closely to the recipe as I could, using what I had on hand. Goat butter, sweet onion, a hunk of thinly sliced fresh ginger, a handful of cilantro, cracked mixed peppercorns, and probably a teaspoon (maybe more, didn't really measure) of cumin. Oh, and I didn't slice the okra. They were little'uns, mostly under two inches, so I just tossed 'em in whole.

Perfect recipe, it helps that I love Okra so much.  I learnt on this site (little too late) not to wash Okra as it gets slimmy, did not affect the taste though.

I really ejoyed this! I put in the spices before my okra. Next time I will do the opposite because a lot of the flavor ended up on my onions-which were amazing! If you cut the okra it will be slimy, but I left mine whole and didn't have a problem. Its prettier this way too. Try not to stir it too much that will help and at the end turn up the heat to sear it. I would add more onions, since I liked eating them with the okra so much.
*The second time I made this I didn't have any ginger or coriander so I add cinnamon, cilantro, parsley and lemon juice instead - it was pretty amazing!

Washed my fresh Farmers' Market okra and cut off only stems and tips (Fried Green Tomatoes cookbook tip). Cooked as directed, except I added more spices and also red pepper flakes. Cooked about 25-30 min uncovered because my pan didn't have a lid. Delicious! Will make it again. It's puncturing the pods that produces slime, not washing them.

I loved the flavor, but didn't have enough okra, so I added green beans and green pepper. I also added some Indian spices (Anjwain and Galengal). Served it over quinoa and it was really good.

Excellent recipe! I think some people are confused about this recipe - it is not supposed to be SPICY - just SPICED with Indian flavors. I used fresh okra from my local farmer's market, and only gave them a quick rinse before patting dry and slicing into large rounds, and I had virtually no slime at all from the okra. I did increase the spices (about 50%) and it was perfect for my taste. I served this with fragrant rice (brown rice in the rice cooker with a few whole cardamom pods and cumin seeds thrown in at the beginning) and chicken cooked in a store-bought (Trader Joe's) Korma simmer sauce. Made a fantastic meal, and I'll do it again, soon.

It was very good and not slimmy.  My picky-eater husband liked it too.  I added a little more of the spices.

YUM!  Even my vegetable hating son liked this.  I used frozen okra (we northerners don't see much fresh), thawed it under cold water, and cut it into halves.  The seasonings were just right. I'll make this often!

I used frozen okra since fresh is hard to get where I live and added a can of stewed tomatos. I doubled the spices because we like big flavors. Great easy recipe.

This is a wonderful alternative way to cook okra.  As a Southern gal I was raised on fried okra but this is now my go to recipe for cooking okra.  It's super quick and easy to prepare, too!

This was a great base recipe! A few changes: I used vegetable oil to make it vegan. I also used frozen okra and halved the cooking time. I added 1/2 tsp of chili powder, a pinch of cayenne, and a Tbs of tomato paste (with a little bit of water added near the end). This made it a little saucy, which I prefer.

This is a superb method of preparing fresh okra. It's easy, slime-free, and delicious! The only alteration I made to the recipe was to use chili powder since I ran out of cumin.

I love okra, but this wasn't something I'd make again.  I just wasn't particularly fond of the mixture of spices.  Also, it was a bit slimy, which I wasn't expecting after reading other reviews.

A great, and healthy, way to enjoy okra, and it was sooo easy to make.  The only change I might make is add more of the spices:  I like my food strongly flavored.

I doubled everything in this recipe except for the butter. I was following another reviewer who suggested that we would want leftovers, and I'm glad now that there are leftovers in the fridge. Also, I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of the spice mixture, it is yummy! I made this with pasanday and zarda, and served with warm pita (couldn't find naan). It was a really good meal.

Here's a variation that I like. Use frozen "whole baby okra" instead of sliced okra and a good olive oil instead of the butter and your dish won't be the least bit "slimy", or, as aficionados call it, "silky". Also, when you onions have softened to your liking and you've dropped your okra into the skillet, add enough water to almost cover the pods. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce your heat to low, allow to simmer - covered - for 10 to 15 minutes, to taste.

my first time making okra.  i would say this was a success.  scaled the recipe down considerably.  i didn't put in enough butter so i used some olive oil also.  i cooked on high heat uncovered as to 'char' the vegetable.  not bad.  thanks caligal76!

ummm, it's really not very good. the inside is slimy, as you chew it. i used a little less butter, and no onion (since i didn't have one on hand). other than that, i followed the recipe closely. not much flavor. battered and fried okra is much better.

I really enjoyed this!  I used frozen okra, olive oil instead of butter and added a dash of cinnamon, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  I may try and make this into a a one dish meal by adding garbanzo beans and diced canned tomatoes.

This is very close to the bohni bindhi I used to get at my fave Indian restaurant.  Soaking the okra in vinegar for 20 mins does add a slight vinegar flavor, but for me this was true to the flavor I was getting (and loving!) in the restaurant.  I added two tomatoes, cut into 8 large chunks each, increased the spices and added 1 T garam masala.  The longer you cook the more the sliminess disappears - cook for the full 20 minutes to eliminate.  Served with raita and chicken tikka masala (recipe on this site) for a truly fabulous at-home Indian meal.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very good and easy...the soaking in the vinegar didn't work for me and it was a bit slimy, but that's just Okra...it is supposed to be that way.  I didn't have all the specific spices so I used Chinese 5 spice.

I usually shy away from okra, but have been trying to incorporate more veggies into my diet, so I tried this - Much better than I had anticipated!  I cut okra and soaked in vinegar/water solution, then rinsed and patted dry.  The seasoning is not overpowering at all - I added 1/2 tsp salt, reduced butter to 1 Tbs., added 1/4 cup of chix broth to okra once butter was soaked up.  I also added a small diced tomato.  I loved it!

I have only had okra fried, in gumbo, or stewed with tomatoes so this was a great change of pace.  Nicely spiced and easy recipe.

My husband bought a bag of frozen okra and only used a 1/2 cup in another recipe.  I had never had okra before and did not know what to do with the rest of the bag.  I found this recipe & loved it.  Now I make it atleast once a month.

This was the first time I ever tasted okra, other than in a gumbo.  I have to say that I did not really care for it.  I did like the spice blend, though, and I might use it on other vegetables.  It did taste "Indian Style" to me.

another way to do this recipe is to slice one side of each okra lengthwise and stuff it with the spices.  some spices will fall out and coat it during pan frying.   tasty!

i made it 1or 2 times, but everytime it was kinda slimy. So did a QUICK TRICK?? microwave the cut okra in a microwave safe dish for 5-6mins( depending on quantity) or u can bake, if u dnt like microwaved food much,)),, and then put in the pan ( with already sauted onions nd spice for few mins) and simmer for another couple of mins Under brown, and it turns out amazing though it may need some practise like every other recepie.  really great with rice, naan or indian roti etc.            another trick?? wash it a night before and let it dry overnight

Made this recipe with coconut oil and red bell peppers for color!   Wonderful! A staple for tasty ( not slimy at all) okra! Like my okra crisp and reduced cooking to 10 minutes.  Used okra that was smaller and cut into one inch chunks.  Also, added garam masala like previous reviewer.

I had 3/4 pound of frozen okra.  I kept the butter and spice amounts the same but reduced cooking time.  The spices were not too strong but didn't seem to do anything for the vegetable.  It was just tolerable to eat as written but was not too bad when dipped in melted butter.

Very good. I started with frozen chopped okra, so it didn't take as long to cook. I threw in a can of diced tomatoes at the last minute after the okra were done frying. It turnned out really well and went great as a side to keema. Served with Pita bread.

Absolutely wonderful, and super easy!  What a nice change to the typical okra/tomato/rice dishes you normally see!  I've made this dish twice, and have received rave reviews!  Thanks for the delicious recipe! :o)

This is very good but you do, absolutely, have to double the spices.  It's not spicy-hot, it's spicy-flavorful and without doubling the seasoning, it wouldn't be either.   Thanks for the nice recipe!

Good! I used frozen okra and reduced the cooking time. Topped with plain yogurt and toasted cumin seeds. Very nice flavor. Thanks!

Excellent side dish! Living in upstate NY, I didn't even know what Okra was until a friend from the south introduced it to me. I had to buy frozen whole Okra and that it in a bowl of water for a few hours, but I can't imagine this impacted the recipe too much because my wife and I loved it. I on;y had half a pound left, and forgot to cut the spices down in half as well, but it still tasted wonderful. I always use whole spices, and the cumin and coriander were toasted before ground.

After making this for the 3rd time I was compelled to write.  We have had a bumper crop of okra this year.  This is the best recipe for okra!!! Having grown up on steamed okra, slim and all, this is not like that at all.  I followed the recipe not changing a thing...it's perfect!  The spices are so good and there is just enough butter without making it greasy like fried okra.  I plan to freeze my extra so we can have it this winter.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an awesome recipe.  I actually used curry powder and doubled the suggested amount.  Being a Southern gal okra wasn't okra unless it was fried or sauteed with tomatoes.  Everyone loved it, including my 4 year old.  Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this a lot!!  I used frozen okra (I've never seen fresh around here) and it was fine.  I'm not a huge fan of okra, but it's growing on me.

This recipe was nothing like any Indian okra dish I have ever had. And it was definitely slimy which is hard to get past. The flavor was still good but it was not my favorite, I will probably look for something else.

Easy and tasty.  I followed others' advice and soaked the okra in vinegar for 20 minutes (all the time I had).  It was still slightly slimy, so I definately don't want to know how bad it would have been without the vinegar soak.

Very good.  I used frozen okra, added a little leftover tomato sauce, added 1 tsp of garam masala to the spice mix, and cooked for around 15 minutes.  Came out perfect.

I wasn't expecting this to taste like a dish from the Indian rest. around the corner. I still expected a little bit of flavor to it. Even after doubling the spices and sprinkling cayenne pepper on it, nada. It just wasn't for us. I had to doctor it up to where it was a completely different recipe for it to be edible for us. I did read the other reviews and soaked it in vinegar and added garam masala. My okra wasn't slimmy. It was just bland for us. We ended up with a nice spicy Okra after adding cayenne and other Indian spices we had in the pantry.

I added some chili peppers and a little turmeric.  I still felt like it needed "something".  My dh loves okra, he usually makes it...this was my first attempt, and, I admit, his is tastier.  But, he said it was good, and that's what matters because I made it for him tonight.

We will make it again. It has a very mild Indian taste and works great as a side dish with baked chicken. (we used Honey Baked Chicken  II).

This was a great find as I looked for something to do with farmer's market okra. The flavors are a welcome taste after the stewed and fried okra I ate as a kid.

Extremely easy to follow, and calories information is on point!  I count calories so most recipes I prepare are noted.  I’m not a huge fan of okra but I will say this really was tasty and I enjoyed it as a main instead of side.

Had to  modify this recipe for my Indian husband. Double all the spices and add 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice or to taste. Use ghee if you have it, or if not butter is acceptable. After making these changes he loved it.  Before doubling salt and turmeric though, give it a taste and then decide if you want to add more of those two spaces in the end (just use what this recipe calls for and then add more if you want more)

Loved it. Okra has a bad rap, my mother made fried okra with a cornmeal and black skillet, always liked it. Now though this is my favorite way to have it. Spices really adds to it.

I haven't made this yet but I have a question for a  party I am hosting on Sat. What is the sauce that is poured over the Okra? It looks very nice and I would like to present it the same way. 
I have never even tasted Okra before but this recipe looks like a great side for our Indian pot luck dinner. 
Thanks for any help.

I made this as-is, though I may have shorted the cooking time somewhat. I ended up doubling the spices after I tasted it. It was tasty and I will use this as the basis for variations on the dish in the future. Thank you for sharing.

I love this stuff!!! But then I love okra and do not mind the slimy nature of this vegetable. That's just the way it is. This recipe is great. I made it exactly as written. The second time I made it I did add a couple of chopped Roma tomatoes just because I had them on hand and it was very good that  way too.

While there was nothing wrong with this, it just wasn't spectacular or extraordinary, not something that made me think 'YUM, I need to make this again!'.   I had some okra to use and was looking for something different.  This was just OK and made it exactly as written.  (Not sure what that white topping is in the picture--maybe that would've made it better).

I added the tomatoes and that definitely made it a heartier, tastier dish.  The hubby and I love spiciness, so I threw in one diced up serrano and it was perfect.  This is a great vegetarian dish or side.

Pretty good. I used a quarter of everything because I only had a little fresh okra. I had to add water to cook or it would have stuck and it did stick at the end. I used my cast iron pan and added a few slices of a chili pepper from my garden towards the end. Nice and hot and good spice mix flavour. I would make again and maybe add fresh tomato from the garden and see how it is. Good base recipe. Thanks

I had to use chili powder instead of coriander and I added some olive oil to keep it from sticking to the pan. I also didn't cook it 20 mins - only about 10 - it was browning too much. At the end I added some shrimp to it. ABSOLUTELY loved it. Yum! My husband loved it too and we'll make it again. So much healthier than frying - thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was great.!  I soaked the okra in vinegar then sliced lengthwise and laid in butter to brown while I added crushed garlic and grated onion along with the suggested spices and the vinegar that I soaked the okra in (great addition to taste).  Next time I will use crushed jalapeño.  Fried covered for 10 minutes...okra was fresh.  Uncovered and added one fresh diced tomato.  Wonderful addition.  My husband whose favorite vegetable is boiled okra and tomatoes was thrilled with an okra dish with a new taste.  Next we try baked okra...but it can't be this good.

I added chopped tomato, green pepper and garlic as well as cayenne for heat and it turned out well. I used frozen okra which made for a mushier texture than I would have liked, but still not bad.

I like this . . . after I more than doubled the spices! As written, this would have been too bland for my taste. I used frozen okra, and that worked out well.

delish!  i used olive oil instead of butter, and added diced fresh tomatoes as per other reviews.  could definitely use more of the spice as well for a good strong flavor.  it was soft but popping, not gummy as okra can sometimes be...

This is a great recipe. The spices are just right. I was looking for ways to use my bumper crop without doing the fried okra thing. I'll be making this a lot.

Being a lover of Indian food, I am happy to say that I have found another way of eating okra.  I tried this dish for the first time and loved it...has a very good flavor.  I added fresh baby bella mushrooms.  During the cooking process the liquids were cooking out (even at the lowest heat...probably the mushrooms sucking them out) so I had to add water twice until it was done.  It could have been my smooth top range.  I served it over rice and dug in.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe!  I made it 4 times as it is written and on the 5th I decided to try soaking in vinegar.  Don't do it!  I rinsed well but it still had a mild vinegar flavor and, to me, it ruined it!  I also doubled the seasonings.

I had never had okra before in my life but thought I'd try a new vegetable and this looked like a tasty way to prepare it.  It was good -- though my kids wouldn't eat it. I would make it again -- easy to prepare.

I found this okra was slimy, despite other reviewers' reports. I did like the flavor of the okra, but I disliked the softness and the sliminess. If I try this recipe again, I will try baking it beforehand to draw out the slime, then rinse it before preparing it as the recipe instructs.

I thought this recipe was okay.  I used frozen okra.  It turned out well, only it was a little slimy.  My dad kept complaining about the sliminess.  (It didn't bother me!)  Also, I felt like the dish didn't have enough flavor.  Maybe, a few of my spices were getting old...but most of my spices are new...so I don't know.  Overall, it was a nice alternative for cooking okra. :)  Thanks!!

Interesting flavor--I've never tried okra before, and it was a little gluey.  I added a little garam masala and a pinch of sugar.  Also replaced the butter with olive oil.

Easy to make. We didn't have fresh okra at the grocery store, so I used frozen okra instead and it turned out good.

this was awful we've never had okra before, so maybe if you love okra you'll like this recipe, but it was not very good at least for our taste.

It was good okra, but I don't see how it was terribly Indian.

This recipe is smashing!  We took it to a potluck, and it was eaten right up!  I think the title "Indian style" might deceive some people.  With the spice amounts recommended, it doesn't really come out tasting like an Indian dish (although it is wonderful).  This may be why many others are recommending to increase the spices.  In any case, a welcome new recipe to my okra repertoire!

I thought this was very good.  I also increased the spice mixes by 1/2.

Delicious! Next time we will double the recipe. There were only two of us, but we definitely could have eaten more!
