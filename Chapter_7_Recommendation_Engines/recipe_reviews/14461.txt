I gave it a five star rating as long as you make some adjustments - particularly, use 1 cup couscous and 2 cups water - you only need to let the couscous stand for 5-6 minutes - not 30.  I also cut back the onion to 1/2 a small one.  I also used dates instead of raisins, which I highly recommend doing.  I also used the couscous with the pine nuts and used some slivered almonds I had.  I added some cucumber as well and used almost one whole can of chick peas.  I used buttermilk ranch dressing - the same amount called for in the recipe.  I realized at the last minute I didn't have any yogurt, so I just added more ranch and it was still very good, but I'm sure it would be even better with the yogurt.  Great recipe though, and you can really do alot of variations with it.  It's a keeper!

This was a really yummy recipe. I used FF ranch dressing and FF yogurt.  I also used whole wheat couscous from Trader Joe's and cooked it without the butter. Everyone at dinner loved it.

I served this as a warm side dish instead of as a salad.  I replaced the red onions with carmalized videlias, and lightly sauteed the red peppers.  I also omitted the cumin.  It was fantastic.  I had it cold the next day for lunch--this will definitely be made again!

We go on frequent picnics here in Sydney Australia with the same group of friends and they each take a salad, usually the same salad each time.  I tried this new recipe and everyone commented on how tasty it was.  The salad was extremely simple to make. An absolute must for the next BBQ.

This was a really tasty recipe.  It definitely needs to be completely chilled so make ahead.  I used fat free ranch dressing and it tasted great.  It is a complete side salad with both grains and veggies-very filling.

Quite delicious!  Variations: I used sundried tomato couscous, 1/2 c. firm tofu, pine nuts instead of almonds, and finely chopped spinach in lieu of parsley. 
Seems like a bizarre combination with the medley of ingredients, but it does work well.

Thanks for this recipe!  I have made it twice- the first time I only added 1/2 an onion and found it quite strong in the salad if you eat it by itself, but OK with other salads, BBQ meat etc.  The second time I left out the onion and it was better (I don't really like onion, though, so that's why I liked it more without).  Also I made it with 3/4 cup of Garlic and Pepper savoury yoghurt (Brownes brand, available here in Australia) instead of combining salad dressing and plain yoghurt and it was delicious!

This salad tasted great!  I used only half a red pepper and half the onion and it was still a fabulous salad.  I also reduced the fat a bit by using light mayo and yogurt.  Try it, you'll love it!

Couscous is always quick so it's great when we're pressed for time. I was thrilled to find this delicious recipe which I've already used about 4 times. All our family and friends love it!

I gave this recipe 4 stars. All the right ingredients are there, but I found the proportions to be a bit off.  So, here are the modifications that I made (which I think made it a 5-star salad): used 1/2 a red onion instead of a full onion, doubled the amount of couscous (but used the same amount of dressing!), used a full can of drained chickpeas, and substituted chopped dates for the raisins.

The other confusing thing about this recipe is that it says the couscous will cook for 30 minutes! Unless there's some crazy slow-cook couscous out there, I'd say 5-6 minutes, tops!

Very nice.  I wasn't sure what was meant by creamy salad dressing, so i followed some of the other reviewers and used 1/3 c ranch dressing and 1/3 c yogurt for dressing and yogurt.  Very nice flavor, great with grilled chicken and a salad.  Update: I have tried this a couple different ways, and I recommend cutting way back on the onion.  Also, I found that the texture was not nearly as good when I used whole wheat couscous, so I don't recommend that.  Refer to other reveiwers regarding cooking time -- they are right!

Great! Great!  Yummy indeed.  Although I must say that it's not quite as quick as others have mentioned. I guess I'm a slow chopper.  I'll make it again.  Absolutely lovely.

This recipe is a lot faster to make than stated.  The Couscous takes only 5 minutes to prepare; this is an excellent salad for the bbq's!

Personally, I didn't like this recipe. If I were to make it again, I would hardly put any onions in. They seemed to take over the flavor of the salad.

I had to improvise a little on this recipe because I ran out of mayo in the process of preparation.  I had to add about 1/8 cup fat free sour cream, and I used fat free yogurt and mayo too.  I also forgot the onion, but the salad still turned out great.  I will make this again.  Next time with all the right ingredients.

Very good, with the modifications mentioned below.  I don't like ranch dressing, so I used Safeway Select's Goat Cheese and Sundried Tomato Dressing.  Like others, I found the directions for cooking the couscous to be strange.  1 c. couscous and 1 1/4 c. water will do the trick, letting it covered off the heat for 5-6 minutes.

This is a great recipe!  I omitted the onion and substituted the red bell pepper with a yellow one, along with golden raisins.  For the salad dressing I used a creamy 3-cheese Ranch, and I added more cumin for taste.  It came out delicious-o!  I plan to double the recipe and take to a BBQ this weekend.

Here is the key to this. The original has been changed but it was somewhat correct. Make the Couscous as directed (typically 5-6 minutes) but then let it cool (after fluffing it) then add it to the mixture that way the heat does not turn the sauce bad. One you do that you really can simply use this as a guide line. I personally added curry powder and a bunch of other stuff and it came out great.

Upon making this salad I thought it was an unusual combination of ingredients but, I was looking for something a little different for a barbeque.  It is simply wonderful!

This was a good salad. I am not a big cilantro fan, so next time I will leave it out, or sub another herb.

This is a delicious spring salad for picnics and cook outs. I have made it several times and like it best with creamy cucumber dressing. I agree that half a red onion is enough.

We all thought this recipe lived up to its title. I used 1/2c. of homemade ranch (Ranch Dressing II from this site) mixed with the yogurt and cumin. For the couscous, I used a whole wheat variety and subbed vegetable stock for the water. Oh, I also added some dried cranberries because I didn't have enough raisins. The only minor complaint I had was that there was too much red onion, but I'd used a fairly large one, so I have to take some of the blame for that. Next time around, I'd only use half an onion or a small one. Anyway, it's a really great salad... Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Fantastic salad. Like other reviewers, I felt there is too much red onion. But the problem may be that if the amount of servings is reduced, the amount of onion - 1 red onion - stays the same. For 2 people, 1/4 of a red onion at most. But it's a delicious salad, easy to make, very flexible in terms of ingredients - I've added cucumber, chicken, sweetcorn etc, at various times, and it still tastes great.

This was good. I did cut the fat by not using butter or yogurt, only used 1/2 cup fat free dressing. Will make the same changes aging next time.

Definitely yummy!  As you can tell from the other reviews, there are endless possibilities for variation, and they're all good! -- I added edamame, roasted red pepper, and cubes of cheddar.

The leftover dressing was delicious on salad.

The other reviewers are right -- just cook the couscous in the normal way, and it should only take ~5 minutes.

Yummy is right!  Just be sure to go easy on the onion.  Green pepper works fine too.  This would be great on a picnic.  Everyone loved it at the office party.  FOOL PROOF RECIPE!

This has become a summertime standard in our house.  I sometimes make it every week and keep in the fridge.  I love the yummy cumin yogurt dressing.  And don't be afraid of the raisins and almonds - i don't usually go for raisins, but they were perfect in this.

Has a dinner party tonight with this and the "Cashew Crusted Chicken"; amazing hit with a large group of people.. Definitely worth a repeat. I couldn't find almonds when I went shopping, but it works amazingly with crushed macadamia nuts in their place.. :)

edible but not probably will not make again. Stuffed it in pita bread which made it more tasty.

Was such an excellent recipe, one that I will keep in rotation forever. Used pine nuts instead, then garnished with sliced almonds on top.
