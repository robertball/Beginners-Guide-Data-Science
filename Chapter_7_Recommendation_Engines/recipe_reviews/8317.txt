I used to make this exact recipe years and years ago.  I was disappointed that I lost the recipe.  Well....  I have several jars of jam that people have given me.  Time to use at least a few of them up.  I am so glad to have found the recipe again!!

I love the taste combination of the oats, jam and cheesecake like filling.  I used to use strawberry jam and love it.  But this time I have a few other flavors of jam that I want to try.

It is a very easy recipe to make.
