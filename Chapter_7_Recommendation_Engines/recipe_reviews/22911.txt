I bought the fruit but forgot the dip at the market.  Most recipes in this category call for marshmellow cream and I didn't have any!  I had all 3 of these ingredients on hand - this was easy to make and tastes delicious.  Wish I had more cream cheese so I could make another batch!  Thank you.

This was a great fruit dip!  I originally halved the recipe (was making for 4)...then, I saw how little it made and proceeded to make it as directed.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Splenda brown sugar blend per other reviewers' suggestions.  I also added about double the vanilla.  I served w/ fruit kabobs w/strawberries, grapes, and Granny Smith Apples.  I would strongly suggest using a hand mixer to mix to ensure a smooth consistency!

Easy, tasty and no special ingredients!  Our family likes it better than the store bought versions.  I do find that it's better if you wait 30 minutes to an hour before serving so all the sugar disolves, otherwise it has a gritty texture.

We love this recipe and encourages children to eat their fruit.  It is so creamy and taste like a million dollars.  For a change, try rum extract in place of the vanilla.

Excellent.  Very addictive.  My mom won a fruit tray that had this dip with it and we were hooked.  We searched for the recipe and were so excited to find it.  I used fat-free cream cheese and added 2% milk like other posts suggest to get a better consistency.

Absolutely wonderful! This dip adds the perfect amount of sweetness to any fruit. I used pineapple, strawberries, kiwi, and apples, and I cannot wait to try it with grapes and canteloupe, too. A fruit kabob and this dip alongside a chicken salad croissant would make the perfect summer lunch.  Thank you Donna!

This was very good!  Even my cousin who never eats fruit went crazy over this! I made a few changes however.  I only added 1/2 cup brown sugar, doubled the amount of vanilla, and added a few heaping spoon fulls of strawberry yogurt to make more creamy and easier to dip.

This serves as a good base recipe for a fruit dip. To give it a little something extra I replaced about a quarter cup of the sugar with some honey, added some lemon zest and about a tablespoon of lemon juice, then added about a teaspoon of ginger paste. To lighten the texture up a bit I beat some whipping cream to semi-stiff peaks and folded in the cream cheese mixture. It turned out delicious!!!

I made this for my son's graduation party and everyone asked for the recipe.  The fact that it was so simple was an extra bonus since I had so much cooking to do.  For fruit, I had strawberries, raspberries, grapes, kiwi, and cantaloupe.  The dip went great with all of it, especially the raspberries!

I have been making this dip since my children were little. This is something they have always loved and now my daughter makes it for her children. For a little variation, I would occasionally add chopped peanuts. We always served with Granny Smith apples...tastes like a caramel apple.

I have made this recipie several times for parties and it is easy and a crowd pleaser.  I would suggest making it the night before and allowing it to sit in the fridge to allow the sugar to dissolve.

Because of its slightly brown color, party guests were hesitant to try it, but once they did they all loved it. It was best with berries, especially blackberries.

Absolutely amazing. So simple to make - the only change was that I used a hand mixer to smooth the consistency a bit. Used it for a bridal shower with a variety of fruits and everyone loved it - i may have even eaten some straight off the spoon!

This didn't end up being the hit I had anticipated. Maybe a bit too rich, too cream cheesy. We didn't eat it all.

This fruit dip is wonderful!  So easy to make and once it is left to chill in the frig for a while, the flavors really come together.  I made this for a potluck and used a large round plate and set big beautiful whole strawberries on the plate and put the dip in a clear bowl in the center.  It looked like a big strawberry wreath.  Beautiful and oh so tasty!

I made this on Superbowl Sunday and all of my friends LOVED it! I had to share the recipe with them. I modified the recipe and used fat free cream cheese and splenda brown sugar. I also added a little bit of milk to thin out the consistancy.

Creamy, rich, and it tasted like caramel. I served this with grapes, strawberries, and canteloupe. All were fantastic with this dip! This is very thick and not very dippable, but it goes with all the fruit we tried. I was originally looking for something to duplicate Jason's Deli fruit dip, but wow this is even better! My husband raved and asked for this with fruit for dessert every night! From an ice cream and home baked brownie devotee to fruit? (Okay and THIS dip!). I cut this down to 2 servings and he ate them both. I was only able to sample a grape dipped in this wonderful stuff! Thanks RNACSHHS.

This is the same recipe as Apple Dip. It is very good, but a little thick for the softer fruits. We like it with apples, bananas and nectarines.

Good dip.  I liked that it didn't have marshmallow in it as another reviewer said.  I made it in advance for a party and put it in the frig.  I should have taken it out sooner so that it had time to soften beforehand.

Very tasty.  I used light spreadable cream cheese and brown sugar blend Splenda (1/2 as much as the recipe called for) to make it lower calorie.  It whipped up very nicely.  Sprinkled chopped pecans on top as well for added flavour and to dress it up a bit.

Great simple recipe. I added about 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt (creamier and less tangy than the regular yogurt, available in high-end grocery store or Trader Joes)and this toned down the cream cheese. I think it would have been like cheese cake otherwise. Might be fun to experiment with other flavorings, like almond extract instead of vanilla.

Super easy and REALLY tasty!  I served this along with fresh pineapple, fresh strawberries, and granny smith apples at a party and it was a huge hit.  By the end of the party all the fruit was gone, and not much of the dip was left.    I mixed mine all together with a mixer.  The only thing I would say pay attention to is that sometimes brown sugar gets the little hard bits, and those don't really break up when you're mixing everything together.  But after the dip chills for a while those bits eventually soften so you can just stir them smooth.

I thought this was terrible. TOO sweet and too thick. It wasn't easy to serve with fruit and no one barely touched it.

Yum!! I halved the recipe because I only had 1 box of cream cheese.  It was so good.  I did mix with a hand mixer and got a very creamy texture.  Great with all fruits.  Will use this recipe from now on!!

I have used this recipe several times in the past, and it is always a big hit. This time it seemed a little thick, but I admit I used cream cheese that had been frozen. I decided to add about 2 TBS of half and half and WOW! I  can't believe I haven't done that in the past. It makes it just that much creamier. Maybe only add a bit at a time though, so you don't thin it too much. Imagine if you had a couple of tsp of whipping cream on hand! OOOO

This recipe is excellent! I make it often when we go to friend's houses. Everyone loves it. Try getting cinnamon graham crackers with it, it's better then regular graham crackers.

A few kids at my daughter's 21st birthday party parked next to this dip bowl and moaned about it all night - it was THAT good!  I have to admit though, I added a tsp of LorAnn carmel flavoring with the vanilla flavoring because I was serving it with apples.  Couldn't have been easier to prepare and gave big taste for such little effort.  Thanks for a KILLER fruit dip recipe that I will turn to again and again...

I halved the recipe and served it with cherries and strawberries.  My girlfriends refer to it as the "brown sugar crack dip" recipe.  Perfect summer time dip that is sweet, but not "over the top."

Needs more vanilla than called for... then it is 5 stars. Keeping adding a bit more vanilla to your taste. Kids and adults all love it... great with apples, but also works well with strawberries, grapes, and bananas.

Big hit with the kids....super fruit dip! I, personally, found that it tasted a little too cream cheese-y, so I increased the brown sugar by about 1/8 c., and we all noshed.

This is very good even though the consistency was a little thick for me.  I added a little whipped cream to lighten it up and was still very tasty!

Sheer bliss!  Two notes though: "blend" means with a mixer.  Even after leaving the cream cheese sit out to soften for several hours, it was still too thick to mix by hand.  One minute with my electric mixer on low and it was blended to perfection and just the right consistancy for a dip.  And it turns out brown sugar coloured (which shouldn't have been a surprise with the ingredients) but took me aback for a moment as I was expecting something the colour of cream cheese.

Personally, i didn't like it. However, I'm super picky with my foods. I'm going to an easter party in a while, and I KNOW everyone will love it. It has a very appealing (to most) taste. I thought it was WAY to easy to make and i loved it! After preparing it in 5 minutes i thought that i must've done something wrong! Great recipe. Much kudos

Needed a quick fruit dip for a party and only had basics on hand. This is so easy, fast and delicious. I whipped it up in my stand mixer. I like it thick, but you can also get a thinner, creamy consistency by adding a little milk or cream.

I was out of cream cheese, and didn't have time to run to the store.  However, I had a big container of plain yogurt.  Substituted that and it worked well.  It was a little thin, but folks loved it.

This fruit dip is awesome! I added a couple shakes of cinnamon the first tiem I made it, and it was yummy! The second time I made it, I added the cinnamon and folded in some cool whip- the girls at work loved it! This will be a recipe that I use over and over again. I am also thinking of adding pumpkin to it, and serving it with vanilla wafers! If you try it before me, let me know how it tastes :)

I love this recipe.  It always comes out really well.  Sometimes I will mix in some sugar free jello for a different flavor.

My kids loved this recipe.  We cut up some apples the first time we made it and it was gone in no time.  We only made a half recipe.  I just made it again and we ate the dip with apples and strawberries.  My daughter really liked the strawberries in the dip, too!

DOUBLED YES DOUBLED the brown sugar before it finally reached a flavor suitable for my guests... ended up having a strong caramel flavor, but far from being something I could just eat by the spoonful.   ~N~

This is so good it's hard to believe there's just 3 ingredients in it...I did add just a TINY amount of milk to make it what I thought was a good dipping consistency.  Perfect with Granny Smith apples and walnuts.

I made this for our Mother's Day brunch, to go with a wide variety of fruits - the dip complimented them all and was very easy to make.  Got so many requests for the recipe!  I agree that the simplicity of the recipe makes it a winner.  Thank you for sharing it!

Easy and delicious.  I used the lite cream cheese and it was still good.  I mixed it in a blender to make it really smooth.

This is an outstanding recipe. I couldn't believe how good it was given that it had only three ingredients. Unlike others, I could eat it as soon as it's mixed. I did follow the suggestion that I thin it slightly with a bit of milk.

Very good and very easy...I took it to a family party and it made those who don't even like fruit eat the fruit salad I made to go along with it!  The only thing I would say is maybe let it sit out for a couple of minutes before you serve it so it can get a little soft and spreadable.  Excellent and extremely easy recipe!

This dip is very similar to another recipe that was given to me by a friend- with half the amount of sugar.  Each and every guest at my party raved about it and wanted the recipe- they were surprised at how few ingredients were in it! I made exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing.  Definitely a keeper!  A bonus is that it uses ingredients that I usually have on hand.

Really good dip.  Even better the next day.  I cut the cheese in half (used light cream cheese), used slightly less sugar (maybe 3/4 of a cup) and way more vanilla (prob just over a tb.)  It was still too thick so I added cream (whipping cream cuz its what I had, maybe a 1/4 cup total.)  We had 2 back to back family birthday parties this weekend, and every person who tried this dip wanted the recipe, it was amazing!!

I made this with modifications (I can never seem to leave a recipe alone). I used just 1 8 ounce package of cream cheese and used just over 1/4 a cup of white sugar instead of brown sugar. I did use 2 tsp of vanilla extract though.

I was looking for a fruit dip that had great ratings but I kept coming across ones that used whipped cream... I don't have that on hand currently so I had to search for one that didn't have that. This sounded yummy and simple & as soon as I tasted it, it brought me right back to my childhood. I remember my mom used to make it & I had completely forgotten about it. Glad I stumbled upon this! Yummy with strawberries & apples. Also a nice alternative to the standard chocolate or caramel dips.

Made as written, but I think it would be fine to cut back on the sugar a little bit. It was a hit with my son's swim team and I will be making it for them again.

Made it just as written except added a couple of Tbsp of vanilla Greek yogurt to make it not as thick.  If no yogurt available might try adding heavy whipping cream. Made a lot, might 1/2 it next time.

This dip served with sliced apples was a great, somewhat healthy, snack for my bridge group.  I really appreciated the fact that it went together quickly, could be made the night before, and consisted of ingredients that I always have on hand.  I used nonfat cream cheese and slightly less than the full amount of sugar.  It was perfect -- the combination of apples and dip tasted a lot like caramel apples, just slightly less sweet and not sticky.  The leftovers worked great as part of my breakfast, too.  Thanks, RNACSHHS, for a great recipe.

I found that the basic recipe made a dip that was too thick for my liking. So I added 1/3 cup of sour cream and it was a lot easier to dip the fruit in. Yum!

Excellent!  Better than the fruit dip you get at the store...and easy and cheaper.  I thinned it out with just a teeny bit of milk, and it was delicious.  Especially good on strawberries!

I really was disappointed with this dip.  The cream cheese flavor was way too strong.  Definitely felt like it was missing something.  I followed the directions exactly as written.

I LOVE this recipe. My mom made something similar when I was young but she couldn't remember it and I couldn't either. I've been searching for years for something comparable and this is it! I usually make it with light cream cheese - same flavor, less fat and easier to mix up. I also add chopped nuts sometimes - and sometimes I don't. Awesome either way. If I use regular cream cheese I add a splash of milk before I use the hand mixer and it helps thin it out a bit. The recipes calls for it to sit for an hour before serving - I have NEVER done that. I either serve it right away or chill for 10 or 15 minutes and it's never been anything but delicious and it's never been grainy. It's our fave with apples. Yum! Awesome recipe!

This was so so tasty and really really easy. Two things I love! The brown sugar has a really distinct flavor. I didn't add the vanilla (didn't have any but I really don't think it made a difference) and mixed in some milk until it became the right consistency for dipping - probably about 1/3 or 1/2 cup. No one could believe this was so few ingredients! It is very sweet though - I served it with melon, watermelon, pineapple, strawberries and grapes, but I'd say it would probably be perfect with apples. Thanks for the recipe!

Not a favorite - just tastes like sweetened cream cheese. I tried to fix it by using more vanilla or more sugar. It is ok, but just isn't awesome. I'll make homemade caramel next time I want a sweet fruit dip.

I really liked this dip.  It made a lot, I thought, and I halved it.  Or rather, I thought I halved it.  I forgot to halve the brown sugar and halved the rest.  So, it was a bit sweeter than it's supposed to be, and I noticed my dip looked a little darker than the other pics . . . this would be why!  I put in too much brown sugar!  Still, it's nice and tart and sweet at the same time.  Good with strawberries!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a hit at my superbowl party. I should have made double the recipe. Awesome. I may not use as much brown sugar next time and I used about a teaspoon more of vanilla. So GOOD.

This got many compliments! I served it during the football game and the guys really liked it. I liked munching on something fairly healthy. Loved it because I had all the ingredients even without planning!

I will have to admit, I was a little skeptical of this at first. When I made it I was completely shocked!  LOVE IT...I made it for a BBQ and everyone loved it!  Awesome recipe.

Heavenly!!! I couldn't stop saying MMMMM! -I used 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of one whole.- The kids loved it too. One of the young guests spooned it (over and over) into her mouth.  Good thing she did that when the fruit tray was almost gone because we had to tip the last of it into the garbage!

This recipe is Fantastic and simple! I have an extensive food allergy list and the shorter the ingredient list the better for me.  I subbed 1/2 vanilla bean (scraped) for the vanilla extract and halved the recipe.  I had to bribe my daughter to try it and then she disappeared with the dip and a spoon! So much for the fruit she was supposed to eat with it!

Was okay. I thought it was heavy texture for a fruit dip. I am still looking for the the right dip.

I halved this recipe and cut back on the brown sugar a bit.  My kids really like this but I prefer the dips with marshmallow creme.

I love this recipe!  I was looking for something simple and quick to go with the fruit at New Year's and this really worked!  We used it then and loved the taste and use it now on regular days.     :-)

Yummy! Wanted a slightly healthier version then the fruit dips that call for  marsh. creme and cool whip (both of which I dont like either). I used lite crm cheese and 1 tbsp of vanilla. Everyone loved it!

I thought that this was a very simple but tasty recipe. Store bought fruit dips can be very expensive. I tried this out with a few guests for the Super Bowl and it was well received. I will definitely make it again.

This dip reminds me of a dip from my favorite restaurant when I was a kid. I have searched for a recipe like this forever!! This is great with apples and strawberries. Would be great with a few chopped nuts!

This was very easy and good, but it seems like it may be missing something small.. Maybe next time I will try and add a little frozen whipped cream.. Very easy though and tasted much better chilled rather than right after it was made.

I really wanted to try the other fruit dips that have mainly marshmallow fluff and cream cheese in them but since I live in an arab country, it is VERY difficult to come by the fluff (pork in it). I tried this recipe and I have never had so many compliments from something so simple. It was featured as part of appetizers for a banquet and I had so many people approach me and tell me that it was the best thing they ever had. Not only did they eat all of the fruit with it, but they also dipped celery, bread, carrots, etc. The only change I made to the recipe is that I did have on hand about one cup of fluff that I bought at a special store last November and have been saving it. Thank you for this terrific recipe.

Kids love it. I usually add 1 cup of crushed peanuts to the dip and call it Carmel Apple Dip. Great as a snack or dessert. I've found even the non dessert eaters cannot resist this one.

I let the cream cheese sit out a bit to soften, then mixed it all up with the electric mixer.  Served at a Bible Study with strawberries and apple slices and it was a huge hit - they couldn't believe how simple it is!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good I used neufetchal cheese and added fresh nutmeg and it was wonderful I may try adding some cool whip for a fluffier dip. Also a great spread for bagels.

This was wonderful. I made it for guests and could not stop eating it. Use good vanilla and I did heat my cream cheese for a bit (only a couple of seconds) to make it softer and easier to mix with the sugar. I didnt have to let it sit at all.

I served this at my 4th of July party and my family was raving. I am not normally a big fruit eater but with this dip...let's just say I ate my share and more! I used a fat free cream cheese and let it sit at room temperature before blending and didn't find it too thick for the fruit (and we used berries with it).

Very very good!  I even ate some right away before refridgerating it.  Mmmmm.... I did 1/2 of the recipe because that is all the cream cheese I had.  I loved it.

Found this to be a little too sweet. Served it for my book group and it was barely touched. Probably won't make it again.

The recipe was great in a pinch. Very simple. Towards the end I added a bit of peanut butter to make it go further and it was great!

Super simple and tasted excellent, especially with sliced apples! I took this to a church dinner and people asked for the recipe. They couldn't believe what few ingredients were in it, because it tasted so good!

Took this to a girls luncheon, and no less than 6 of them asked for the recipe!  So quick and easy, and everyone loved it with apples!

Thanks!
