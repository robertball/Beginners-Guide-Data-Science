Good banana and oat flavor, but a bit dry.  First off, I'm sure it's a misprint but I put in 1 WHOLE egg, instead of a tablespoon of egg!  I subbed canola oil for vegetable oil, 1 cup of all purpose flour in place of 2 cups of wheat flour. For some who may not know rolled oats are old-fashioned oats, not quick cooking. Finally, I added 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed.  The batter was very thick, filled my paper liners 3/4's of the way full.  My muffins cooked in 20 minutes and I got 14 muffins.  Next time I will try applesauce in place of the oil and maybe a handful of chopped walnuts.

I'm always looking for new ways to use up bananas. Now that my dad knows I bake a lot with bananas, he's now bringing all his ripe ones for me to use. I followed GodivaGirl's lead and cut back on the flour, as she thought it was too thick. I did half a cup of wheat and half a cup of white. I added in a half teaspoon of salt and a little bit of nutmeg. End result was a moist, flavorful banana muffin. I think if I were to make these again, some chopped walnuts would make these perfection. Super fast to throw together tonight as to have less of a hassle for Sunday breakfast. I plan on pairing it with a fresh fruit salad.

I made this recipe with one cup white flour instead of any wheat; one cup quick oats instead of slow-cooking; 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. It was really good, especially considering the reduction in oil.

I've been making muffins for quick weekday breakfasts for years now and was looking for something new. These muffins are great! I wasn't sure about the ginger at first. This may sound strange, especially since there is no butter in this recipe, but the mixture of ingredients comes together to give the muffins a rich, deep, almost buttery flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, and the muffins did seem a little dry at first. (If we were to eat them the day they were made, I'd probably add 2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce, for more moisture.) I tend to refrigerate the muffins, and we eat them over the course of a week. This works really well, since this gives the spices a chance to develop depth of flavor, and the moisture of the bananas develops as well. This is a great recipe!

After noting the comments that these could be dry, I cut the vegetable oil (I used canola) to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup plain yogurt and an additional egg. I also included 1/4 tsp. salt to help bring out the flavors. I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat.  These came out great with my revisions. I did like the unusual touch of adding ginger to this recipe.  Since I used large muffin tins, it only made 6, but I expected that.

These are great!!!  After reading other reviews that said they could be dry, I decided to reduce the whole wheat flour to 1.5 cups.  The recipe makes a lot of batter- I just filled the muffin tin cups full & it was fine.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but the muffins were inedible due to a metallic type taste?  I wonder if the baking powder amount is too much? 1 tblsp is far more than in other recipes I make.

These were good, I substituted the oil for 1/8 cup oil and the rest unsweetened applesauce.  They still turned out good with less fat.  The oatmeal made them a little heavy but they were definitely filling!

These are a substantial muffin. I added about 1/4 c of sour cream as the batter seemed a bit thick and added chocolate chips. They are very yummy!

I didn't have any baking soda so I used half plain flour and half self raising flour which made them rise beautifully. I also used white sugar though I am sure brown would be better for flavour next time. They seemed a little dry so I'd keep my eye on them at 20 mins baking time rather than the full 25. Lovely muffins thanks!

These muffins r excellent w/just a couple of the reviewers recommendations...i have made these twice.the 1st time, I added 1/2 c of sour cream to make more moist. 2nd time, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour, I subbed 1 quarter cup of the oil for unsweetened applesauce, added 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 half cup chopped walnuts. no sour cream the second time and texture was perfect! it's a bit too much sugar I think next time I will cut it in half. Will make again & again.

Great recipe!  I followed to a T except replaced brown sugar with 7/8 cup white sugar and a tablespoon of molasses, and decreased flour to 1.5 cups.  For those of you getting dry muffins, maybe you are using small bananas.  Mine were very large - about 1.3 pounds with the peel on altogether.  I made this into a bread pan, and it baked in about 50 minutes.

Pretty good recipe. As one reviewer noted, the recipe more than likely refers to large bananas. I however had regular sized ones, so I upped it to 4. The mix look just a little thick, so I added a splash of milk. The result was a moist bread. If I were to make any adjustments to the recipe, it would be to include some salt. The bread tasted bland and I feel a 1/2 tsp of salt would have perked that up. Easy enough fix. Will certainly make this recipe again.

I thought these were good, and fairly healthy compared to many muffin recipes.  I did do half wheat flour and half regular, half applesauce and half canola oil,  also subbed in nutmeg for the ginger b/c I am not a fan of ginger.  I will probably make these again!

They're ok, but I suspect that 1 tablespoon of baking powder is too much.  I can taste it in the muffin.  Batter was thicker than any muffin batter I've ever seen.

These were awesome and I only played around a little (some of it due to availability of ingredients) I used 1 c whole wheat and 1 c regular flour. 1/3 c of brownulated sugar and 1/3 c of Ideal sweetener. I had no veg oil so I used 1/4 c butter flavor Crisco and 1/3 c almond milk. I also upped the cinnamon a bit (loves me some cinnamon) and added a dash of nutmeg and maybe 1/2 a tbsp of agave nectar for fun. They were moist without being dense and my coworkers ADORED them

I made these per the recipe. Adding 1/4 c. crushed pecans and 1/4 c. chopped, dried(mixed) berries. If you store them tightly with a piece of bread they wont get or be dry.Nice healthy snack or breakfast food! My new favorite. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I had saved this recipe because it sounded so good and used whole wheat flour and oats. The rating was good until I read the reviews.  It is of no value to me if the reviewers have significantly changed the recipe!  I'll find another recipe...

I liked these.  I didn't have wheat flour, so used 1c white instead.  Next time I will try them replacing half of the oil with applesauce.  They were a bit heavy on the oil for me.  I also added some chopped pecans to half of the batch and preferred the ones with nuts.

This really is an excellent recipe!  I loved both the taste and the texture.  I doubled the cinnamon since we like a stronger cinnamon taste and used dark brown sugar since that's what we had.

These were delicous. They are a bit dry, but we ate them warm with some butter and loved every bite. The oatmeal gives great texture!!! Next time I think I'll add a 1/4 cup of applesauce to lend some moisture. I plan on making them again!

Great basic recipe that I followed verbatim the first time.   I found it to be a bit too sweet for my taste, and slightly dry, so I modified it.    ~~ reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup ~~ used 5 mashed bananas ~~ reduced oil to 1/4 cup ~~ added 1/4 cup applesauce ~~ added roasted, chopped walnuts ~~ sprinkled tops with toasted wheat germ  My hubby eats one on the way to work with his coffee and my 2 1/2 year old can have as a nutritious snack.  Thank you for sharing!

These are fabulous! My 10 year old daughter made them but rather than using brown sugar, she used white. They were still delicious.

Amazing, these are my new favourite muffins.  I used a quarter cup white flour.

I've been using this recipe for quite a while, but without actually having measuring cups and spoons in the house, I felt unqualified to give it a rating since I wasn't sure that my ratios were correct.  Anyway, I made it last night, and it turned out really good.  However--oops!--I forgot to put in the egg.  At first I was worried, but then I just laughed it off a little because I'm allergic to egg anyway.  (I'll make a new batch today with egg to give to the people who I was going to give them to and keep this one for me. It's rare that I'm able to enjoy my own baked goods as substitutes are usually more complicated than desired.)

Turned out great for me. Only modification was making smaller muffins and only baking 20 mins. Were moist and yummy.

I liked these muffins. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and only used 1 1/2 cups wheat flour and used applesauce in the place of the oil, and I subbed splenda for half of the brown sugar. I think next time I will increase the cinnamon and add some nuts. I also only baked them for 20 mins and they turned out very moist.

The flavor is great. I substituted 1/2 cup stevia and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar to reduce the sugar content. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. The muffins were still quite dry as others have mentioned. Next time I would increase the applesauce to 3/4 cup or use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup plain fat free yogurt.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I decreased the amount of baking power to about 1/2 Tbl because of the "metalic taste" comment. I started with one cup flour and one cup oats but found I needed to add about 1/3 cup more flour to make the consistency right. I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg, about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, and about 3/4 cup chopped dates.    This yielded 12 regular sized muffins plus 16 mini muffins.  My husband gave them 5 stars.  I'm going with 4 because I made changes.  Thanx for the recipe.

After reading other reviews I substituted vanilla yogurt and a touch of olive oil at the end instead of the vegetable oil, also added honey and walnuts to taste.  I topped these with lowfat carmel apple dip  after baking instead of traditional icing to entice my teenager and she loved them!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty!  I used 1 c whole wheat flour, and then the other 1/2 c was a mix of ap flour, oat bran, and wheat germ.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My granddaughters will LOVE these!

Love the recipe; the muffins turned out great. I read some of the other reviews and used less white flour and 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce. I loved the texture the oats gave the muffins though... Yum! :o)

Halved the sugar and flour (used white flour). Added pecans and dried cranberries. Used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4th cup oil. Added pinch of salt. Real tasty.

I read the reviews and took some advice. Used 4 small to medium bananas and added 1/4 teaspoon salt. Changed baking powder to 1 teaspoon. After that everything else was same. Fantastic! Will make again with same changes. My 5 year old helped and loved them!

I love this recipe.  Only sub was 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup stone ground flour, and 1 cup white flour.  Came out moist and delicious, even with the 1 tblspoon of baking powder.  Use a bit more cinnamon as well. Made a lot of batter, so made 12 good sized muffins and put the rest in a bread pan to make a small loaf for a friend.

Have made this 3 times now. Love that its a quick recipe to put together and it serves up 12 nice size muffins. Did take one posters advice and only used 1.5 cups flour and added a cup chopped walnuts. Great muffin. Good spices. This is my go to for a quick morning breakfast.

These JUST came out of the oven and they are great!  Subs based on my preferences:  used 1c apple sauce instead of oil and 2 bananas, 1 Tbs cinnamon and no ginger, increased vanilla to 1 tsp, increased flour by 1/4 cup to take the extra liquid.  Added 1 c raisins and 1 c chopped walnuts.  Used small muffin cups and filled almost to the top.  Baked for 15 minutes, and they were perfect. Will be making again as they are healthy, easy and delicious! Perfect for breakfast or with a cup of tea.

I doubled the powdered ginger because I really wanted the taste to shine. However, I hardly tasted it (and wouldn't have if i hadn't wanted to expect it). It may have also been the 4th banana I added that swallowed up the ginger taste. I will keep 4 bananas in the recipe and add even more ginger to the next batch. Because there were comments on them being dry, I added about a 1/2 cup of yogurt to the batter, and they were moist for several days (refrigerated, of course). Muffins tend to be dryer than the same recipe in bread form, so I often add yogurt to muffin batter. Update: I was in my thoughts the second time I made it and forgot to add yogurt; they ended up very dry. I had to eat them with butter and jam to get them down. Therefore, I made my review a 3 instead of 4. Thanks for the recipe, Emily! :o)

Yummy, healthy muffins!  The only change I made was doubling the cinnamon in place of the ginger (I'm not a huge fan of it).  Great breakfast!

Fantastic muffins. They came out very moist and delicious. I used 1 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup of white flour. I added a tablespoon of ground flaxseed and 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. My husband and I ate these right up!
