I just want to add that the amount of time it boils in the baking soda water is very important. If it stays in the baking soda water too long, the flavor is very strong.  Mine were inedible because I boiled them for maybe 2-3 minutes each side. Hope that saves someone from making the same mistake.
(I'm not really rating the recipe)

These pretzels are great.  I like to  make pizza dough into pretzel dogs.  Put the pizza dough on floured board (wood or cookie sheet) and slice the dough so you get long, 1"-2" pieces of dough.  Just roll the hot dogs, sausages, polish sausages, or whatever in long sliced up pizza dough  and wrap them around each hot dog or sausage spiraling from top to bottom.  Boil in 4 c. boiling water water with 2 T baking soda  for 1 minute, put on an oiled cookie sheet with a few grains of uncooked oatmeal, or uncooked cream of wheat on the sheet to prevent sticking and bake at 375 until they are done and browned on the top (slightly less brown than John's) like a pretzel - about 20-25 minutes.  Even if you accidentally cook them as brown as John's, they will probably be fine.  I've made 50 batches of these and none of them have ever failed.  Dip them in mustard and ketchup if you'd like. They get rave reviews from my kids, their friends, and, even, adults.

This is now a go to treat at our house. Iâ€™ve made it with store bought and homemade dough...although I have found that fresh dough is harder to work with. I often let it sit in the fridge for a day. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were easy and turned out really well. Next time I'll let the dough warm up a little more before I try to shape it. But overall a quick, simple recipe that yielded yummy results.

I had 18 oz of pizza dough left over from a few days ago when I made a double batch of Wolfgang Puck's pizza dough recipe (CJ presented it recently on FoodWishes.com).

My family loves soft pretzels (even for a quick breakfast), so I decided to try this recipe this morning.     They turned out great.  I do recommend always watching CJ's videos at least twice for all his recipes before attempting them.  So much more can be learned from them beyond what is written on the recipe page.    Thanks, Chef John!

Oh my!!! These are amazing and so easy. Sometimes I do not even add the extra flour and they still turn out to be absolutely delicious. They are 100 times better than the mall pretzels! My son likes to make them into a sandwich with prosciutto and beer cheese sauce. Try this recipe and you will be happy.

The receipe was great! I did make my own pizza dough using pizza dough yeast, as the store bought doughs sometimes change with the seasons. 
I have come to love Chef John's recipes with videos in tow! Follow along without deviation on the first attempt. TY
Chef! Top off with a little mustard!
