I made it last night. It turned out really yummy,except it was too sweet.That's why I gave it four stars. Next time I will reduce the sugar.Both of my grandmother's made kugel differently and I didn't like either of theirs that much. The reason I didn't like theirs is they both put raisins in it. One used black raisins the other golden. This is a good basic recipe with a great consistency.

This was a very good recipe. I used one cup of sugar, as someone recommended, which was plenty.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a chopped-up Gala apple and a handful of raisins.  All of these were good additions, especially the cinnamon.  I skipped the cookie top--I like the crispy noodles that form as a crust.

I've had so many heavy and dry kugels that I was thrilled with how this one came out. Moist, light, exceptionally edible. Even the waif-sized teen girl at our table ate FOUR pieces! It's a keeper for our family. However, I used half the sugar and it was still on the sweet side but that is definitely a personal taste.

This was absolutely delicious and a big hit with my whole family- including my 2year old and 4 year old picky eaters. I also 1/2'd the sugar and it was fine. Will definitely make this one again!

Just a few changes: to make it more diabetic friendly, I replaced the sugar with Splenda and only used about 3/4 cup.  I used 2% cottage and lite sour cream and used four whole eggs and four egg whites.  I added 1 cup of diced dried fruit to the noodle mixture.  For the topping, I mixed together about three tablespoons of whole wheat flour,  3/4 to 1 cup Splenda brown sugar blend, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and cut in 1 stick of butter.  I spread the crumb mixture on top of the noodles and baked as directed.  So yummy I didn't want to stop eating it!  Next time I will try it with fat free cottage or ricotta cheese, fat free sour cream and more dried fruit.

I've been looking for a recipe for noodle kugel forever!! My grandmother used to make it but she doesn't remember all the ingredients and amounts now. This was exactly how I remember it! The only thing I did differently was add golden delicious raisins mixed in, just the way grandma used to.

I had Kugel many years ago and it was so delicious, I thought I'd make it for Easter. However, not knowing which recipe to use,(all recipes has quite a few)I decided to use this one. The only changes I made were to add a can of well drained pineapple, omitted the crackers, and mixed cinnamon and sugar for the top. Everyone loved it! Unfortunately, ther were no leftovers :(

I've never made a noodle kugel before but this turned out very tasty!  I made a 1/2 recipe and reduced the sugar as others suggested (3/4 c instead of 1 c for a 1/2 recipe).  I think it would be fine with the full amount of sugar and will probably follow the recipe exactly next time.

I first heard about Kugel from an episode of "Seinfeld". I didn't know what it was, but I heard the words "noodles" and  "cinnamon". I was intrigued, so I looked it up on this site. I just made this particular recipe tonight. I cut it in half because I only had a 11"x7" pan. I read in the reviews that you should cut the amount of sugar in half. I also read that the recipe needed some "Oomph". I decided to try brown sugar instead of regular sugar. It turned out perfect. My boyfriend tried it and loves it. I can't wait to make it for the rest of my family.

Ah well... !??? ???? ??  Moist kugel with good texture.  But, based on other customer reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar by .5 cup, and then found the recipe not sweet enough.  I would leave it alone and just follow the recipe as is. 
Ah well... !??? ???? ??

I loved this recipe. I made it for a party and my Jewish friend said it was even better than her mom's. I think that's the highest compliment you can get. It was easy and I followed the recipe exactly. Good Stuff!

Halved the sugar and added 1 cup of golden raisins.  Also used regular graham cracker crumbs instead of cinnamon grahams.  Outstanding recipe!

Very good base, I added a chopped Fuji apple, raisins, a teaspoon of cinnamon, vanilla extract and used only 1.25 cups of sugar.  I think it tastes better hot than cold
