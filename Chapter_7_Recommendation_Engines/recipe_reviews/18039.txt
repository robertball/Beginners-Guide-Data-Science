I made this in my crockpot and it turned
out really moist and tender.Suggest 
cutting down on the oregano a little.
Definitely a keeper.

Don't make the same mistake that I did! I used a bottom round roast instead of the chuck roast, and it wasn't good. I quartered the roast before I put it in the water, and after 7 hours it was still very tough and unflavorful. I took the 4 pieces out, and cut them into slices and boiled them for 2 more hours. Then I had to make my own gravy and pour over the slices (once they were removed from the water) to give them some taste. An expensive mistake because I paid $20.00 for this 5lb. roast.

Wow!!! I loved this. It really was very easy to make, just takes alot of time to cook, so plan ahead. I used a 2 1/2 lb roast, so I cut the water, salt, bouillon, and garlic salt in half. But I put the suggested amount of other spices into and tea ball and it worked out great.  I'm not a coffee drinker and didn't want to invest in coffee filters I won't use, so I picked up the tea ball on a chain and it was PERFECT for this and reusable. I thought the beef was perfectly spiced and very versatile. The black peppercorns gave it a wonderful flavor.
Oh yeah, because the roast was not covered in water, I turned it over every couple of hours. YUM!!! Thanks for this recipe, Tammy!!

I made this recipe for dinner last night and I must say that for the minimal amount of time it takes to prepare, this is a very tasty recipe!  I made a few changes; didn't have peppercorns so I used course ground black pepper, substituted a can of beef broth for the water and boullion cubes, left out the rosemary because I didn't have any.  I bought a roast on sale, cut it into large chunks and simmered on low all day in my CrockPot while I was at work.  I shredded the beef and let it simmer another hour in the juices before serving.  Served on toasted sweet french rolls with lots of melted Jack cheese and the juices on the side for dipping.  Made a big green salad to go with and YUM-YUM!!  VERY GOOD!  I plan on using the leftover shredded beef in Taco's tonight.  I just love recipes where I can use the leftovers in a completely different way because my husband and son usually turn up their noses to leftovers.  Thanks Tammy for a simple, delicious and versatile recipe!  This one is going into my family favorites recipe book!!  I will be making this one often!!

This came out really delicious, and I'm not one to rave about a piece of chuck roast. I had a much smaller roast (maybe 2 Lbs.) but I used the full amount of seasoning called for. I subbed 2 Tbsp. beef flavored Better than Boullion for the cubes, omitted the oregano (due to personal preferences)added a tsp. of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning, a sprinkle of Accent and a few drops of worcestershire sauce. Didn't bother with the coffee filter idea... just added the seasonings to the water. In less than 4 hrs. we had  incredibly tender,   deliciously seasoned meat, with an excellent dipping broth that I was able to freeze in cubes for future use. (Bonus points!)  Don't be afraid of the salt, this is a boiled piece of meat, and you really need it. We enjoyed ours on toasted subs with melted swiss cheese on top. I could also  see myself preparing this   with the oregano and other seasonings to use in Mexican dishes.  Thanks for the recipe, Tammy. It's a keeper!

Made this for the Fourth of July and it was a HUGE hit.  Could've had a double batch.  Other food had leftovers, but this was wiped out. Per the other reviews, I left out the oregano.  Also, we cut up the meat into chunks first, easier to pull apart later.  THANKS TAMMY!!

This Recipe was great I have several cured pork roasts that seem to be dry whenever I bake them in the oven, on the stove top this recipe is sooo good and you can barely poke it with a fork with out it falling apart. I also aded a couple of hand fulls of baby carrots about a  1/4 of a large white onion and 5 or 6 russet potatoes quartered and it was great even my 2 YO ate it !!!!

This recipe was VERY good and easy to make. I would have it more often, but the fat and sodium content is very high. This is a one in a while treat.

Tender, delicious and delicately spiced!  I halved the recipe and had more than enough for SIX french roll sandwiches.  Because the flavor was so subtle, I sprinkled monterey jack cheese, salt, and pepper onto the sandwiches and they turned out wonderfully!

This recipe was great.  I did as suggested and used the coffee filter and then added the "loose" spices again in the roast itself while it was cooking except for the salt.  I am a salt lover but would cut the salt back and use garlic powder instead.

Had extra, so I have frozen and ready for beef and noodles.  Saved the extra "au jus" for flavoring soups and stews.

Thanks for the recipe.   Have shared with family and friends.

I thought this was more of a crockpot recipe than a stovetop one. I had to cut the recipe in half though, 5 lbs of meat equals 5 servings? Yikes, that's a big ole sandwich.....haha! I love the coffee filter idea. I used Better than Bouillon and chopped garlic that comes in the jar instead of garlic salt. Turned out great and the juice is a perfect dip to complement. Add all to the crockpot cover and let it go, no diassapointments!!!! PS, i don't know why someone would buy the wrong cut of meat and "butcher" the recipe and then rate it 2 stars. Learn from the mistake, but don't not try it bc someone deviated from the recipe and left a poor rating. Yummy!!!!! Thanks!!!!!!!

I have tried several French dip type recipes and this one beats them all! I've used the same recipe to cook chicken and it comes out delicous too. I generally leave out the rosemary because I'm not fond of the taste. I usually try to make more broth than we'll use and save the extra in one cup container in the freezer. Then when I have a recipe that calls for beef or chicken broth, i use it. YUMMMM

If I could give this recipe more stars I would. My whole family raved and raved about how good it was. My hubby even had a twinkle in his eye. We had roast, chive mashed potatoes and veggies the first night. Second night we had the tacos with shredded roast, refried beans, fried onions, cheddar cheese, lettuce, sour cream.  It was yummy!  Now tonight we are going to have french onion soup, like one of the reviewers suggested.  We can't wait.  Love this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe! I've made it twice both times with smaller cuts of meats. I deleted the salt, substituted the garlic salt with minced garlic from the jar.  I also used canned beef broth rather than the bouillon cubes.  Served over rice or like open faced sandwiches this can't be beat!

Very tasty and tender!  I had never thought to boil a roast before, but it really made it delicious!  I froze some of the beef stock to make French onion soup later.

YUM!  I realized too late that I didn't have coffee filters so I just put it all in loose, (But used ground peppercorns instead of whole.)  It all sank to the bottom anyway so no harm no foul.  I also realized too late that I didn't have enough bouillon so I added some beef broth.  My husband and two teenage sons loved them and so did I.  This will be added to our regular menu ideas for sure!  We have enough leftovers to feed our family of four at least once more... maybe two more times.  We also added a slice of mozzarella.

I made this with seasoned salt instead of reg salt, omitted the bay leaves (didn't have any) and peppercorns (i used reg ground pepper) and it still turned out great.  I cut back the oregano and rosemary to suit my tastes as well.  Cooked for 8 hrs on low in my slow cooker and it turned out great.

This recipe is a family favorite! I have been making it for years. So easy! I usually start with a frozen roast and cook all day on the stove top. When using the broth for dipping I use a gravy separator to get much of the fat out. We use toasted french bread and provolone cheese slices. Next night is usually beef and bean burritos! This is one of my most requested meals!

Good recipe for a chuck roast.  I used my castiron pot w/ a 3 lb. roast.  I seasoned and seered it on all sides and cooked on low w/ juices to cover for about 5 hours on low.  Shreaded and returned to pot on off for about an hour.  Served on french rolls w/ carmelized onion and mushrooms.  Swiss cheese melted on top.

This was very good!  I had my roast thawed and did have in the crock pot for 10 hours on low but think it could have even been in there longer.  My family liked alot.

Mine was quite salty - but still very good.  I served it on garlic Foccacia sandwiches with rosemary mayo, tomatoes, lettuce and brie.  Then I put the au ju out in dipping bowls in front of each plate. The sandwiches were amazing.

This is OK, but I'm through fooling around. If I want beef for sandwiches, I'll stick with the recipe for Italian Beef Sandwiches submitted by Dick Pierce.

This beef is fantastic.  Wonderful flavors, blended perfectly.  Melts in your mouth tender.  My whole family loved it and I will make this again and again.  Just great.

I did not use the broth to dip my sandwiches in.  Instead I poured bbq sauce over the shredded beef and served.  Thanks for sharing:)

Italian drip beef sandwiches...Mmmmm. This was delicious. I cooked it all day and then refrigerated overnight. I scooped the grease from the top and then heated it a couple of hours the second day before shredding the meat. Oops! I missed the part about the coffee filter and cooked all the spices in with the meat...picked out the bay leaves and most of the peppercorns before shredding... this still turned out wonderful. It pretty much shredded itself. I cooked it another hour after adding the shredded meat back to the pot before serving. Thanks for posting this gem!

My kids went nuts for this. I browned a submarine bun and put the meat on it and let them dip it in the juice. They loved it. I made  french onion soup with some of the broth, it was great. I didn't use the rosemary or peppercorn. I added my own amount of seasoning. I think that is best so you get your preference in flavor. And I just added it to the broth,instead of using a coffee filter.

This is an excellent recipe for beef in a crock pot. Next time I will cut down on the peppercorns, but its great anyway.  I have used the broth for vegetable beef soup also.

My family (even my picky eaters!) absolutely LOVES this recipe. We first eat the tender roast for dinner, then use the leftovers for sandwiches and burritos. I work from home and have 3 kids under 5, so I love how quick and simple it is!

I have made this recipe several times and every time it turns out great. I sear the roast in a skillet with cooking oil and then cook it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high and 4 hours on low. The meat falls apart and has a wonderful flavor. Highly recommend.

These were good but you must try the "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip", which I liked better.  For both recipes, I buttered and toasted french rolls and ate them as french dip sandwiches.

This is definately my new roast recipe.  The flavor is incredible.  I did not know that roasts could taste like this.  I thought you had to rely on the gravy from the drippings to add flavor.  No more.  That little coffee filter packet did it all I guess.  Soooo, tender, I almost had to strain the liquid off.  I mean, the roast just fell into pieces as I lifted it out the pot.  My only concern...chuck roast is so high in fat.  I am wondering if I could use a different cut for health purposes.

Great recipe for roast beef.  I won't have to use a store bought seasoning anymore for my roasts!  This one is even tastier, and less salty.

Great basic recipe, but even after cutting back the salt, I found it to be a bit too salty.  I can't imagine what it would have been like if I had used it all.  I also omitted the oregano based on personal preference.

Instead of a coffee filter, we always use a tea ball (dedicated for spice use only) and just hang it on the rim of the pot.  

I would also recommend chilling overnight (if time is allowed) so that you can easily remove the excess hardened fat.

The recipe is very, very good.  Very nice flavor.

We found drip beef 3 years ago, and have been making it ever since. I follow the directions as listed. The coffee filter is a neat idea. The house smells wonderful all afternoon while it's cooking (possibly better than the actual taste.) I love this recipe.

We really like this! Easy to make in a slow cooker.  I like to spread horseradish on French bread, perhaps a few slices of munster cheese, layer on the beef, cut the sandwiches in 2-inch section,.... mmmmmmm.

We really enjoyed this.  I put it on a piece of fresh bakery bread then put a slice of provolone on top.  I put it in a 400 degree oven to crisp up the bread and melt the cheese.  I served the au jus on the side and it was a hit!  All the salt in the recipe scared me, but it flavored it perfectly, not too salty at all.

Yummy!!!! This is a family favorite at my house.  I use a tea ball to hold the spices instead of a coffee filter and put the roast in the crockpot.  It's a wonderful smell to come home to at the end of the day.  I halve submarine buns, put some beef on it, top it with provolone and lightly broil it until the cheese is bubbly. Dip the sandwich into the juice - heavenly! We use the leftovers to make beef burritos and I save the juice to make beef stew.  What a wonderful recipe!

This had a great flavor and I followed the recipe.  I cut up the meat and made sandwiches.  I used the juice for dipping and it was wonderful.  Many of the reviews said the meat fell apart, and unfortunately I did not have that result - but the roast was still very good.

2 tablespoons of salt AND 2 teaspoons of Garlic Salt is WAY TOO MUCH salt!  The first batch I made was so salty we couldn't eat it.  I love my Crockpot and I liked the idea of making a french dip in the Crockpot so I gave it another try.  The second time around I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and used Garlic Powder instead of Garlic Salt.  Really yummy!  Glad I gave it a second chance!

Wonderful...a new family favorite!  The only change was I used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt.We didn't seem to miss the the salt from that since you add the other salt anyway.

This was very good and versatile.  We had french dip sandwiches one night, burritos the next and finally used the leftover broth for french onion soup the third night.  I just threw everything in the slow cooker (didn't bother with the coffee filter) and it worked out great.

Was expecting much more taste with all the great reviews it recieved.  We had it served on toasted french bread and topped it with swiss cheese.  I had mine with BBQ sauce, which helped the taste a lot.  It gave it flavor.  My husband had it wih the "Au Jus".  He didn't really like it at all.  He thought it was too bland.

Most flavorful roast beef we've eaten. My husband finds most roast recipes bland. He loved this one. I cut the roast into large chunks (about the size of my fist) which let the flavor permeate all the meat, not just the outside layer. Also I cut down the oregano to 1tsp as suggested. Delicious!! I shredded the meat and put it on toasted hoagies with slices of cheddar. Super easy and lots of leftovers. Try it!

This is an exceptional recipe!  The meat turns out very tender and tasty, and the broth you have left is wonderful.  I only used 1 teaspoon of oregano and cooked the beef in the crock pot.  In the future, I'll be using this recipe for all of my pot roast recipes, not just for sandwiches.

This was great! I found it much easier than making a roast in the oven - I didn't burn myself as much! The flavor in it was great too.

This was excellent.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes and some hot sauce to the cooking liquid.  We ate it on warmed corn tortillas.  I definately will make this again.

This was so wonderfully tender and a versatile leftover recipe....love it! I had beef chuck chunks and was looking for something other than stew. I just squashed the cubes leaving them intact... garlic toasted the buns and melted Jarlsberg cheese nom nom yummy. My boyfriend (picky) was upset I didn't keep enough juice for his lunch!! I haven't had French onion soup in awhile...looking forward to it tonight. I will definitely be making again (double batching it for next time more leftover ideas). A must try recipe. Just wonderful favor:)
*Oh and I didn't have Rosemary so I substituted Italian Seasoning.

I was worried about this being too salty from other reviews, so I substituted 2 cans of reduced-sodium beef broth, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 1 1/2 tsp. salt.  I could have probably used 1 T. salt, so I'll remember that for next time.
This was so easy and it made the meat SO MOIST.  It did not have a strong flavor but we still enjoyed it.  Served on club rolls with horseradish and provolone - mmmm!

The aroma was much stronger than the somewhat bland flavor. We enjoyed this much more when the leftovers were thickened with flour and mixed with a little sour cream, then topped over egg noodles. May have to make it again just for the leftovers!

Was way too salty for us, so the next time I'll cut the salt at least in half. I crock-potted it for 10 hours on low for 2.5 pounds, prob could have been less time, but came out tender.  Would be good for all kinds of uses.  I served for dinner plated, and can see it for sandwiches as well as seasoned taco meat for the leftovers.

This was a hit here, but the second time I made it I omitted all of the salt, including the garlic salt.  Way too salty for us.  I used garlic powder the second time and the third time I shoved sliced garlics in slits I'd made in the roast.  I've used the leftovers for a beef/barley soup and shepherd's pie.

We LOVE this! It has become a regular in our house--whenever chuck roast goes on sale, it's time for drip beef! It is especially great served on Hawaiian rolls as the sweet bread really goes with the flavor of the meat. Reminds me a little of Arby's roast beef sandwiches. TRY IT!

Since I don't have coffee filters, I just dumped all the ingredients into a crockpot then added the meat on top.  I only used 1-2 Tablespoons bullion, no salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of water; which turned out to be more than enough.  Because half of the meat was frozen, I cut it into large chunks then turned the crockpot onto high for an hour.  The meat was beautifully done in about 9 hours on low.  It was aromatic, moist, tender, and delicious.  Served it on lightly toasted bread with a generous drizzle of the juice atop the meat.  Delicious!  I am thinking that maybe some nice swiss would be great ontop this hot sandwich. Hard to go wrong with a recipe this simple and sooo good!

This recipe was really good!   My husband even said I could make it again without me even asking if he liked it.  The kids liked it as well.  Did cut down on the salt.  Used garlic powder instead and it turned out just fine.

I have to say we loved this but the sodium level is really high over 4,000.  Even after omitting the salt and using garlic powder the salt intake was very high.  My husband has to cut down on his salt intake.  I found another recipe on this site that is just as good with way lower salt intake.  I will keep working on this for variety and to tweak down the sodium.  Thanks so much for the post.

This was really good.  I used the crockpot on low for 10 hours, adding a cup of water.  The meat was very, very moist and tender.  We didn't want sandwiches for dinner (though it would make great ones), so just served it with potatoes & veggies.  There were a lot of juices to make gravy (my favorite food). :-)  I need to keep salt-intake down, so I only used 1 bouillion cube since they contains a lot of salt, omitted the salt altogether, and replaced the garlic salt with 1/2 the amount of garlic powder.  I also just tightly secured the coffee filter by itself without the rubberband, because I didn't want a rubberband sitting in there all day.  :-) I'd make it again.

Terrific recipe.  Had no leftovers.  Piled the beef on Pepperidge Farm sub rolls, topped with provolone and put under the broiler until the cheese melted.  Served with the au jus for dipping.  Yummy!

Browned in a fry-pan and then dropped in the crockpot as several others have suggested.   I used a 3# roast and cooked on Low for 10 hours.  I'm not a big fan of crockpot beef - seems like it's always dried out and stringy.  This was definitely an exception.  Excellent flavor and still very moist.  I loved the spices in the coffee filter, so easy!  Next time I'll probably decrease the amount of pepper as 2 T was a little intense for the smaller roast.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, Tammy!

This was excellent!  I don't really like roasts too much, but I seared this really well and let it go on the stove for a few hours.  I only had a 3lb roast, so I halved the recipe, but I wish I would have had a 5lb one.  It was that good.  Also, I didn't use a coffee filter, but just threw everything in the pot, which is fine, but if you do this, make sure you use a strainer to get those peppercorns out.  They are not pleasant to bite into!!!

What a neat and easy recipe!  Threw it in the pot and let go all day.  Was easy to shred for delicious sandwiches.  The juice was very tasty -lots of flavor and perfect for dipping.  We'll be having round 2 tonight, serving the leftover meat in tortillas as suggested.

Good...I was a bit nervous about just tossing in in the crock pot so I slightly seared it...It was realy good..great the next day..almost better. I just ate it plain w/o the bun..
Great one!   P.S... I accidentaly bought the powderd beef mix & It was cheeper & just fine!

This made delicious sandwiches! The meat was so tender it fell apart. It made all family members happy - the kids liked theirs plain, I had mine with the "dipping sauce" broth, and my husband added BBQ sauce - everyone gave this one an A++.

Fabulous!  Very, very tender.  I used two 2.5lb boneless chuck roasts. I omitted the rosemary and bay leaf...served on french rolls with swiss cheese dipped in the au jus.  Better than any other!!

This is a great way to make tough meat great. I had some very tough round steak. I placed it in the crock pot with the seasonings and water and when I got home from work I shredded it. GREAT burittos.

This is definitely an easy recipe and a good base for some interesting variety.  A great start for anything that calls for shredded beef.
