I make these a lot during the summer only I use orange juice instead of Blueberry juice because it's easier to find where I live. This doubles well. NOTE: If you do not have popsicle molds, you can use dixie cups. The great thing about using dixie cups is that they peel down the seam and pop right off.

Wow - only 37 calories per pop. Healthy ingredients, easy to prepare, delicious...what more could you ask for?  And think of the other fruit flavor combinations that you could make with seasonal fruit. Next I will try one with apple or white grape juice and cantaloupe. Or maybe some fresh pineapple with orange pineapple juice.

This is a great recipe for those watching their health and for kids.  I couldn't follow it exactly and instead used plain Greek yogurt, blueberries in syrup from a can (sad huh?) and blueberry/pomegranate juice.  Threw it all into the blender then poured into a 6 popsicle mold and the rest into a plastic container with a lid.  With no added sugar, the pops are slightly tangy with only a hint of sweetness which was perfect.  Even the picky husband loved it.  I will definitely make these with the right ingredients next time (fresh blueberries) but will stick with the Greek yogurt since the tangy flavor is too good to pass up.

FYI, craft sticks are not the same as food grade sticks. You want a treat without toxic chemicals. A spoon turned round with the stem/handle in the Popsicle might work as a reusable solution.

This was amazing! I made it with strawberries, cran-strawberry juice and low fat vanilla yogurt. This also makes a great smoothie.

These are yummy and healthy. I love being able to consider a popsicle a healthy snack. I used 100% blueberry juice instead of cocktail to omit the added sugar. That's the only reason I gave the recipe 4 instead of 5 stars.

I just filled up ice cube trays instead with this mixture and that worked great. Instead of Ocean Spray Blueberry Juice, I used a little orange juice concentrate. That made for a great flavor combo with the blueberries. I thought these tasted better a day or two later than they did the first day - not sure why. These are a little seedy from the blueberries, but otherwise they're great.

Easy to make and the kids especially enjoyed these.  I used 1 cup of orange juice instead of the blueberry juice cocktail; mainly because I already had orange juice on hand.
