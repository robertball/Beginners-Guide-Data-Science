Delicious.  Kind of like a custard, but not.  It would be a delicious filling for a pie.

I found this one and gave it to the activity person where I work, the residents loved it when they did baking with rhubarb! So it gets 5 stars over and over from several ladies and gents.

I turned this basic recipe into a pie by simply decreasing the milk a little bit and adding a couple extra egg yolks.  Then I just put it in a double crust and followed the baking directions.  There's a bit of extra filling, but I just put that in a plain pan and it tastes great as a little extra treat.  I've tried a number of rhubarb custard pie recipes, but this is my favorite!

My man loved this! Nice creamy texture in the bottom.  Just the right amount of sugar, not overly sweet.

To make it gluten free I used 1/2 cup tapioca flour.  I used honey instead of sugar at the ratio 2/3 cup honey  for each cup of sugar and reduced the  liquid by 1/4 cup for every cup of honey used..  I was quite pleased with the results.
