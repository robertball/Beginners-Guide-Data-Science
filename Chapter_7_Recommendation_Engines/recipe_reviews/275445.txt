I loved this! First time making my own pastry. The only thing I found I wanted to add was a bit of balsamic vinegar with the olive oil post-bake for a little extra zing. YUM. Thank you Chef John for the yummy recipe and the easy-to-follow video!

I was looking for a recipe to use up my abundance of cherry tomatoes and thought I would try this.  I had 4 oz of goat cheese  on hand so I halved the recipe and it came out great.  I've never made a crust like this before and it came out really well.  Definitely will make it again next summer!

Excellent!  Made for a casual dinner party of 6.  The whole galette was devoured.  I found the recipe perfect as written.  I was slightly intimidated by making the crust however, the instructions are spot on (thank you Chef John). Will definitely be making this many more times!  Look forward to playing with different fillings too.

I have just made and eaten this with my husband.   Really good!  Had to make a few changes because didn't have some ingredients.   Used cream cheese with some mozzerella with spices (garlic powder).  Softened slightly in micowave and then stirred together.
Didn't have cherry tomatoes, so used up the last of my summer crop of home grown tomatoes, chopped to about the size of half of a cherry tomatoe.  Pastry was easy and tasted really good.
Will make this again.   Husband loved it too.  Thankyou Chef John.
