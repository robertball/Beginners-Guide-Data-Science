This recipe made me homesick, well the base did. In Australia we use "Golden Syrup,
which is a darker syrup than the Karo light. I find it gives the base more taste. You can also
use the base recipe for GREAT Aussie Anzac (Australia, New Zealand Army Corps) cookies.
Just place a teaspoon of the mixture on a cookie tray 1 inch apart. They get their name 
because they were sent to the "diggers" soldiers in WW1.

I had to write in about this one -- it's truly outstanding. Unlike some others, I find it too sweet for my tastebuds so I cut the sugar in the crust to 1/4 cup (or less).  Also, I've tried it with 2 whole eggs instead of 4 yolks.  I separated the eggs, beat the whites and folded them in before baking. Same taste - just a bit lighter. Finally, why not use the lime zest since you're using the limes? Nevertheless, however you tweak it, a fabulous recipe.

When they say don't brown, they mean it!  Also, don't substitute key lime juice in the same proportion, use 1/4 c instead, or else you will have a VERY TART PIE, which i did. Fortunately, I had some fresh whipped cream to help cut the tartness.  The crust is definitely unique, and i am going to try the suggestion to make the cookies as well.

No fault of the recipe, the lime juice I made was just too bitter, as I juiced it (mistakenly) with the skin on. As a result, I used another 1/2 cup of sugar. It was still rather bitter. The crust was unique and delicious, and I know the filling would have been as well. I'll be making this again, with bottled lime juice.

Excellent!!!! I made this recipe twice in two weeks, and everyone loves it.  However, one suggestion - I thought the baking soda flavor came through too strongly using the recipe, so I halved it in the second pie and that was perfect.  Also I never did get the "foamy" result of whipping/stirring the baking soda with the other ingredients listed.  Works well with either lemon or lime zest.  I think the flavor is best with some whipped topping (Cool Whip) on top.  Try it, the crust is excellent and the overall result is addicting. :)

This wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting even after reading all the reviews. As you can see from my photo the crust puffed up huge; by the time the thing was out of the oven it was more crust than filling. While the crust was tasty I think it would be better for cookies; once refrigerated overnight it was very difficult to cut. The filling was not bad at all, maybe a little tart. I made it exactly as stated, juicing 2-3 limes and straining them into the measuring cup, and also happened to have lemon peel on hand. I added green food coloring because the yellow didn't look very appetizing. So, the flavor wasn't bad overall, it just looked funny with a huge crust with a little puddle of filling in the middle. Next time I'll use some of the crust dough to make a small pan of cookies for the kids, and the adults can have the pie.

First receipe I've tried from this website and started on a great note.  Being Australian, we're a big fan of Anzac bikkies and lime so this went down real well at my last BBQ. Thumbs up for this one.

I made this pie the other night for my family and it turned out to be one of the best pies I've every made! It was so rich, sweet and multi-textured - crunchy and creamy - with that wonderful toasted coconut taste. It was like a big custard filled macaroon cookie. Yumm!

The only thing was the prep time was much more than the recipe stated...or maybe I'm just slow. It took me about 45 minutes (or more) prep time.

This was my husband's contribution to dessert for Thanksgiving last year and it will definitely be a tradition in our home from now on! The crust is amazing! Flavorful and just the right combination of chewy and crisp. The filling is tart, not overly sweet like most pies. Delicious!

Very good flavor, easy to mix up.  Next time I make this, will try with key lime juice, adjusting the amount so as not to have it too tart.  Thanks for the great post Louise!!

Using FAT-FREE sweetened condensed milk didn't compromise the flavor at all!  Place a cookie sheet underneath the pie pan as my cookie crust overflowed to the bottom of my oven :(

This recipie was GREAT!  The crust was so tasty.  I'm not a big fan of really strong lime pie, so I made a deep-dish version with a can of cherry pie filling on the bottom and a single batch of the lime filling on top.  It was still a bit tart, though.  It had a nice fizz too because of the baking soda.  Overall, I would say that I would definately make this again, but probably lower the amount of lime juice.  A tip I learned the second time around: DO NOT USE A SPRINGFORM PAN!  It will be a disaster!

I made this for my anniversary and my husband loved it.  I baked it for 15 min instead of 20 and the crust and filling were perfect.  This is a very quick and easy recipe.  I can't wait to try making the crust into cookies.

This was very good! The ANZAC crust was wonderful! I have eaten the cookies before, and I love them. The filling was very good but a little too sweet so I might cut the sugar a tiny bit next time. It was also a little jiggly when I took it out of the oven so I was worried I did something wrong, but after cooling it was perfect!

Soo good! Great crust with a tart filling-- reminds me of key lime pie, but better. Fantastic with cool whip, and would be impressive served at a party with dollups of whipped cream around the edges.

One of the best pies I have ever made.  Not too tart at all and the crust really makes it.  My glass pie plate was a bit shallow so I had a small amount of boil over but I used another pie plate and the next time it was fine.  This one gets raves and requests for recipes all the time.

I enjoyed the pie.  It is one of my favorites now.  Made exactly as the recipe called for.  You have to like tart pies and coconut and oats. Which I do. The rest of my family did not like it either the tartness or the coconut in the crust.  I froze individual pieces and they defrosted great. The taste was exactly as a fresh piece of the pie.  I would give it a 5 rating, but since the rest of the family did not like it I put 4

I'm not Australian, but this pie seemed like something I would love.  The first time I made this pie, there wasn't a picture and I thought I messed up the crust since it bubbled and covered the top of the pies edges.  My husband loved how the crust came out though. It was delicious!  My husband said he thought it tasted gormet or like a specialty pie at some fancy restaurant.  My husband hates coconut though, so I left out the flakes.  I love coconut, so I imagine it would have made the pie even better.

I love Key Lime pie and this was quick and easy to make. Found all the ingredients in the cupboard, no special items needed. I found the crust expanded as it cooked...a bit of overflow. The crust tasted like a coconut/oatmeal cookie. The only comment is the crust is a bit hard to cut. I would probably try pre-cutting it while it is warm next time. I have made it several times and enjoy it each time. Yummy!

Great recipe!  The exposed crust got a little overcooked because I left the pie in the oven the full cooking time to make sure the filling was cooked.  Next time I'll leave it in for a few less minutes.  Got LOADS of compliments, I squeezed the juice from miniature key limes, which although tedious, made it taste super fresh.

Sorry, but way too sweet - made my teeth hurt -- couldn't believe all the other reviews that said it was too tart -- maybe a problem for me, as the crust didn't bake evenly -- the top edge was a tiny bit too crunchy and the bottom (under the filling) was not cooked enough -- my oven is correctly calibrated and I don't usually have this trouble -- Any suggestions?  I love the filling, but will try it with a shortbread crust next time.

This is a little more interesting than they standard lime pie. The cookie crust gives a new twist. I think it is even better when made with key lime juice.

What a lovely and refreshing desert this is to serve on a summer evening! After reading some of the other reviews, and knowing I don't like things that are too tart, I left out the lemon zest, perfect! The crust makes this pie. For those watching calories ( though I know its still high because of the sweetend condensed milk.) in one of the pies I used Splenda, in place of sugar. I could tell no difference between the two pies.

Not that tasty, I found the filling far too tart and the crust a little hard.  Maybe less lime juice would do the trick.

I am glad I chose to try this recipe.  Made this and took it to work, where it was promptly devoured.  The crust is a treat all by itself; add the lime/custard and this is heavenly.  After seeing the crust made, I mixed up a double batch of the crust, cut it into squares and sent it to our troops in Iraq.  Even though it took 3 weeks to arrive, the squares were fantastic and very well received.  Louise, you have provided us with a great recipe!

The lime filling is absolutely gorgeous. I can imagine that the crust is also great, unfortunately mine tasted fizzy from the bicarbonate of soda - I am not at all sure what I did wrong except that the soda did not really fizz when added to the liquid ingredients as described in the recipe, maybe I didn't  wait long enough. I will try it again and maybe reduce the amount of baking soda

Recipe was easy to make with common ingredients.  Lime part was quite tart however and most kids would not like this pie.

I really disliked the "effervesence" of the crust. It was like the baking soda was too much. The filling was ok but a bit too heavy and not lime enough for my tastes.

This was a delicious tart/sweet combo.  I used unsweetened coconut and used the recommended sweeteners and did not think it was too sweet.  The crust stayed firm and crisp even after a few days in the fridge.  The crust was so delicious, and would be excellent as cookies.

Great pie but be sure to have the butter hot enough to make the baking powder fizz or else reheat mixture in microwave. This insures a neat crust.  Try adding extra zest as well.   Everyone loves this pie.

My crust boiled over and then my oven started smoking and I was so afraid this pie was going to end up in the garbage BUT.... I let it cool, then put it in the refrigerator overnight, and this morning it tastes YUMMY!!  So next time I won't use all the crust dough.

My entire family thinks that this is one of the best pies that we have ever eaten.  The crust is worth making to use with other baked cream pies also.  I used grated lime since I didn't have any lemon and it tasted great.  The green flecks showed in the pale yellow pie though so the lemon peel would definitely look better.  My husband is already asking me to make this again.

I tried this for Mother's Day.  Didn't have lime juice, so used lemon juice instead.  Turned out nummy!  Love the crust....sorta like eating a oatmeal cookie.  Can't wait to experiment with other fillings such as chocolate!  Thanks for sharing this unique recipe with us.
