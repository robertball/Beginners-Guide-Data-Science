Wife has raved about this dish all night & this morning too! Loved it myself. Wife says it was restaurant quality & I must make it again soon. Made a few changes: added 1 cup cauliflower, 1 cup broccoli, one small summer squash, one small zucchini to boiling water with noodles for 4 mins. To shrimp added 3 teaspoons curry powder & extra teaspoon of red pepper flakes (we like it hot). Added 1/2 cup cilantro about 5 minutes before serving. EXCELLENT!

This was a very nice recipe.  I doubled the curry as others did and also added some red pepper to spice it up.  I served it over rice and it was very good (even enjoyed by two 13-year olds).  My only negative comment is that the sauce is rather voluminous and strong in flavor, so that it was difficult to taste the shrimp itself.  Next time I would probably cut down the coconut milk in order to make it less saucy.  Other than that, it was very good!

Really enjoyed this recipe!  We didn't have enough curry powder (we use it a lot) so I added a little Garam Masala and I used petite frozen peas and it worked out great.  My DH says it would be great as a side with just the peas too.

This was easy, healthy (only 4 pts per serving on Weight Watchers), and quite good, so I'm giving it 4 stars. You need to double the curry, otherwise the dish is a bit bland. We only had 3/4 pounds of Extra Large Tiger Shrimp, so we added some reduced fat firm tofu and it worked perfectly. We ate this over brown rice, with a salad. Very yummy and perfect for a busy night when you're too tired to do much prep work.

I'm not a huge seafood lover so I used pork, cooked it a little longer before adding the peas, and the flavors worked well together.  I couldn't find light coconut milk so I used regular and I think it was a little heavy so I would recommend sticking with that part of the recipe.  It was delicious but needed a little more spice or salt or something...but I'm certain you could figure it out for your own taste.  My first try with curry and I wasn't disappointed!

This recipe was a hit! I did add additional curry.  We actually topped it off with a wedge of lime.

This was absolutely delicious!  I grilled up a banana and then sliced it up and added it to the dish which just made it that much better!  (Being that the dish was decently sweet, there was no fatty dessert craving afterward either!)

I used Hot Madras curry powder, fresh garlic and lemon juice. I also added carrots. It smelled amazing, but tasted bland.
