Good, plain, straightforward cookie. I did not roll them out, but made about 1 inch balls and flattened, 12 min cooked them perfectly. Crisp and light. Perfect for dipping in coffee or hot chocolate. It would do quite well with other extracts other than vanilla (lemon, almond, etc)

These came out really good.  I omitted the raisins and instead added a little bit of orange zest and the orange flavor came out so perfectly.  After they cooled, I dipped one end in melted chocolate.  Everyone loves them.  Am going to make for the holidays this year.  Also good with dusting powdered sugar if you do not like chocolate.  I highly recommend the orange zest.  A++++

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and used leaf cookie cutters for fall and they were lovely. The taste and texture were excellent and everyone who ate them to loved them. The only suggestion I have is, if you add the raisins remember that you might have just a little difficulty cutting through them with the cookie cutters. I tried a second batch and pressed raisins onto the tops of each cookie after cutting and got the same delicious result with easy cutting. I will make these a lot. Overall great! What a different texture.

A very good cookie when you aren't in the mood for typical chocolate chip or peanut butter.
They are great for cookie exchanges.  It will be different than the others.
I did add a few teaspoons of molasses for the fun of it and turned out great.

These cookies were really good; very light and crisp with a delicious crunch from the cornmeal. I did make a few changes to the recipe; I used only 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar. I also used dried cranberries instead of the raisins. I chopped the cranberries up so that they wouldn't cause a problem with the cookie cutter. Last of all, I added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. These cookies were very different and tasty. I will be making them again!

Fantastic cookie that has now become a family favourite.  The only problem is that it does not last long enough for company b/c my husband and kids eat them while they are cooling.  I omit the raisins and dust with icing sugar.

This is a wonderful cut-out cookie recipe when you don't use the raisins.. I may use it for all my cut-out cookies because the dough works wonderfully and the texture and flavor is so nice!

Fantastic cookies Eve!I'd never even heard of these before but after reading the reviews, I had to try them. Both the taste and texture are great. I'll be making these quite often I think. :-) I didn't add raisins (I have quite an aversion to them). I didn't roll the dough out and cut it. Instead, I formed the dough into balls and flattened with a fork dipped in sugar. Chilling is a necessity, as this dough is quite soft. It's all that yummy butter!

This is a fantastic recipe for all ages.  My elementary school students love them, and so does my grandmother!  They're crunchy and not overly sweet, but still buttery and delicious.  I prefer them without the raisins.

"Simply" Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as it says - except for the raisins, i cut those out completely.  These tasted like cornmeal shortbread.  I love the slight crunchiness, too.   Btw, the recipe doesn't specify, so i used finely ground cornmeal - after tasting the finished product, i would assume that's what the author wants you to use.

Delicious!! I love these cookies! I used a 2 1/2 inch shamrock-shaped cookie cutter. At 1/4" thickness, I ended up with 24 cookies. I baked them for 8 1/2 minutes, til the bottoms were golden. They were soft & crispy-cruchy at the same time. They did puff & spread somewhat in the oven. Probably putting the pan of unbaked cookies in the fridge for 15 minutes would have re-chilled the dough and allieviated this. I did not use the raisins. Next time, the *only* thing I would do differently would be to make a double batch!

Great, easy cookie. Came across this as I was searching for a good zaletti cookie recipe. Mine have dried cranberries instead of raisins, definitely worth trying. I've received lots of compliments on it and that it is a little unexpected. A great addition to any cookie tray.

These were a big hit in my house!  I omitted the raisins & added chopped, dried cranberries instead.  I also added some orange zest & juice for a truly delectible cookie.  I also use a 50/50 flour/powdered sugar mix to roll out all my cookies.  Works great without making them too floury!  :)

Great cookie.  I really like the delicate flakiness with the interesting cornmeal texture that appears as you chew them.  I used Craisins instead of raisins and they're a pretty little cookie. I used a scalloped edged cookie cutter and I did chop up the Craisins before stirring them into the dough so they rolled out and cut very nicely.  Good cookie. They mailed well, too. I sent them to my son at college. He loves Craisins!

What a nice little cookie and the dough is so soft. I didn't try to roll them out, I just rolled them in plastic wrap, chilled them, then while still in the plastic wrap rolled them into a long tube about the size of a 50 cent piece. I cut them thin, baked them for 11 minutes and sprinkled them with powdered sugar. My 88 year old Dad who is a master cornbread maker and has it every day, loved these cookies. I gave some of the dough to my friend and she and her husband loved them also.

Not at all what I expected. I thought these were going to be crunchy cookies with some kind of "natural" flavor, but they turned out to be soft and tasted plain. They are OK, but absolutely nothing special to them. Won't bake them again, I'm sorry.

I was surprised by these cookies -- they stayed fresh for well over a week in a tupperware container, and were delicious.  We forgot to add the raisins, but even without them, the cookies were tasty, and had a shortbread like texture.  I substitued the all purpose flour with a gluten free mix, but I couldn't tell the difference.  I will definately make them again.

Great! Tasted like a cornmeal shortbread cookie. I cheated and used the Marie Calendar's(R) Cornbread mix  recipe with using Butter Flavored Crisco(R),eggs and vanilla flavoring. Yes, I agree just dust with sugar. I didn't have raisins.

Delightful flavor and texture.  I will definitely make these again and again. I didn't chill the dough but dropped on cookie sheet with teaspoon and then flattened with a sugar dipped glass bottom.

I used "Lighter Bake" instead of butter, raw sugar and whole wheat flour and chocolate chips instead of raisins. Turned out great! The texture is definitely much different than your average cookie but I thought putting chocolate chips in gave it that extra bit of sweetness to really enhance the cookie. Mmmm. Great "healthy cookie" alternative and fun new taste! I will definitely save and make again!

I really liked these- very much a balanced mix between cornbread and sugar cookies.  Texture and consistency is like a cookie, yet your tongue is trying to place the slight underlying semblence of cornbread.  Yum!

These were very good! Very similar to sugar cookies. The cornmeal is an excellent addition. Next time I think I'll add just a little bit more of it. I love the texture!

very tasty and economical. doubles easy and very forgiving with substitutions. I  was low on butter and flour, but no worries! subbed half measured amount of  oil+half measured amount of chunky peanut butter ( in equal amounts of each) in place of the butter. Subbed part of the flour with oatmeal ( left it whole, didnt grind it smaller) , and doubled the amount of cornmeal.  Oh, and lowered the white sugar some and added in molasses, cuz I needed that flavor, since I also had no vanilla on hand. Also, no raisins in the pantry. Still  very pleased with the results! Crispy and tasty cookie! Happy to use the cornmeal that was lonely and unused in the pantry! Happy to use older, dry looking peanut butter! The cheapskate wins again! Oh-, didnt roll these out. j
At first, I just made little balls of dough and flattened slightly with a fork before baking  10 minutes at 350*. But then, to go quicker, i shaped into logs , rolled up in parchment paper, and just sliced the dough as needed. after sliced, just quickly shaped into mounds and put on cookie sheets. Try these cookies~ Thanks grandma!

Ours turned out delicious.  I made them for my husband, but I'm not sure any will be left when he gets home.  The cornmeal is still gritty; I expected it to be smoother.  The cookies are indeed hard,  but that may be more me fighting with my oven than a recipe result.  Would probably make again, but will also try the other cornmeal cookie recipes on this site.

They are so good, reminds me of my grade school lunch cookies. I didn’t took them or refrigerate them. My kids and grandkids loved them.

I made these for a cookie of the month club Christmas present.  I made them in January and they were perfect after a month of sweets.  The texture was very good and they were not too sweet but really good with a cup of coffee or hot tea.  They were gone in no time!! My only issue was that they stuck to the cookie sheet and were hard to get off without breaking.  Overall, very good cookie to keep in your recipe box!

These tasted like butter cookies. There was only a slight hint of the taste of cornmeal. I was wondering if it's because I used finely ground cornmeal.

I didn't use raisins and I rolled these and iced them, and they were great!  Crunchy and not too sweet.  Easy dough to work with.

I had some left over sour cream and felt like experimenting, so I used it in place of the butter. Of course, they didn't come out crisp, but they still had a great flavor-just enough sweetness with the cornmeal. I will probably try this again with butter. Thanks!

I thought these had a weird taste to them. Definately do not bake them to thick they end up tasting very dry. They were better as a thinner crisper cookie.

Awesome!  I love crisp cookies so these were perfect. I might add some lemon next time to make it more of a lemon snap.

I agree with other reviewers: this is a good recipe for when you are in the mood for something a bit different, and I can see how they'd be good for Thanksgiving. They are sugary like a sugar cookie, but with an interesting texture.

I've love these cookies. I used to have them as a child a little old lady would bake these for the neighborhood kids. I've been looking everywhere for this recipe. Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe.
