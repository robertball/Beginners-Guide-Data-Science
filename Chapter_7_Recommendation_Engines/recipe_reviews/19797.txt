All I have to say is I love you Grandma Betty!  This is an absolutely phenomenal ice cream cake (move over Dairy Queen.  I used the basic recipe but then tweeked it to suit my tastes.  I used a oreo cookie bottom and then added some homemade rasberry/blackberry sauce. I put the ice cream on top and instead of using whipped cream I crumbled a chocolate cake on top mixed with toasted peacans and some ice cream chocolate sauce.  Then I drizzled the top with butterscotch ice cream topping.  This cake was divine.  I will never need to buy an ice cream cake again.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can keep it simple or make it complicated and it is still incredible.

This is a great "cake"!  Try it in every flavor.
Use frozen yogurt and low fat milk to make it a little more healthy.  I use vanilla wafers for the crust. A+++++++++++!!!!

This is a great no bake dessert!  I made a half recipe and used a 10" springform pan.  I left off the whipped topping before refrigeration.  It needed 3-4 hours to set.  I served with fresh raspberry sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and shaved chocolate.  It was a hit.  Thanks Lisa!

Really good.  Very rich- can't eat a ton at a time.  It really doesn't melt like ice cream cake, which is great when it's 100 degrees out.  I made 2- 9" round chocolate cakes and layered with the chocolate ganache recipe here and crushed oreos.  Froze this, then topped with this ice cream mixture. Froze again til stiff then frosted with whipped topping, ganache, and oreos.  My husband loved it for a birthday cake and wants more!  Very rich, can;t eat a huge slice.  Way cheaper and better than dairy queen or Brusters.

A MUST TRY!!!  This is a simply FANTASTIC Dessert!  I used graham crackers but either would be delicious.  The key is letting this set long enough, least 2 hours.  I did not and it was a little messy but no complaints, it was gone in no time!  The kids loved it too!  Thanks Lisa, this will be a fav in our house.

Everyone loves this recipe!  I use low fat/low sugar vanilla ice cream and I top the cool whip with crushed heath bars.  If I'm low on time, I buy the already made graham cracker pie crusts. (For this recipe you will need to buy (2) pie crusts).

My Mother in law made a recipe similar to this for us.  This was the closest recipe I could find online.  I may try to submit a new one for this. Try it this way for a twist.  Leave out the sugar from the crust, you don't need it.  Instead of vanilla pudding, use pistachio.  You get the sweet from the pudding, ice cream and whipped topping and then you get the salty from the buttery crackers (if you leave the sugar out).  PERFECT combination!!!  I think i may have eaten 1/2 of the pan myself.  :(

All-time summer favorite at our house. I use low-fat everything in the recipe with a chocolate graham cracker crust. Plus, I freeze the whole cake so it is more "ice cream" than "pudding" consistency. I love it with fresh berries, my husband loves it as just plain vanilla. Gets rave reviews! Thanks for the recipe.

Great taste-- definitely had a different texture than most ice cream cakes due to the pudding mix. It needed at least 3 hours in my fridge. I followed suit and used a 12 oz box of Nilla wafers and cut back on the sugar and butter. I also put it in a spring form pan. To give it an extra kick, I put a layer of dulce de leche in between the Nilla crust and the ice cream. As much as I enjoyed it, I only gave it four stars because it got "goopy" very quickly and didn't make for the best presentation.

Fabulous! I used Oreos instead of the buttery crackers.  I Only used 3/4 cup butter with the Oreos since they have the filling.  Very good!

I used Nilla wafers mixed with butter for the crust. I've made this twice, using all natural Breyer's ice cream - once with vanilla and once with chocolate - they were both delicious. Put the cake in the freezer though, otherwise it is more like a pudding pie. It doesn't get too hard in the freezer. YUM!

It was unique, but I'd actually call it a pie, not a cake because of the crust.

The ice cream actually took overnight in the freezer to harden with the pudding.  But otherwise, it was delicious.

Amazing! I get so many compliments on this, and am told that it is better than DQ. I've made a few different versions of this, and really the options are endless! I made a cookies and cream version for my daughter's spooky themed birthday (Complete with knife sticking out the top, and "blood"), as well as a strawberry short cake version (Nilla wafers, strawberry ice cream, and I added fresh strawberries as well)

Quite good, but I agree with reviewer Liz
--way too many crackers for the amount of butter listed. I'd cut the crackers by 1/3 or 1/4. 
I used butter pecan ice cream instead of vanilla, which seemed to go over well.

This was ok. Nothing special. I froze it because I wanted more of an ice cream texture...I used cookies 'n cream ice cream and chocolate pudding mix (both low fat) but my favorite part of the pie was the Chocolate Ganache I put on top (recipe by Ingridevogel).

This recipe looks like it will turn out similar to an ice cream/pudding cake a friend of mine made a few weeks ago that was amazing and I have been trying to find the recipe for. I made this recipe last night (Sunday) and put it in the freezer so I can serve it on Friday night for my in-laws who will be in from out of town and I don't have to worry about preparing it it while they are here.

I didn't think it was as good as everyone raved!  I froze chocolate cake as the crust and used cookies and cream ice cream with crushed Oreos on the top.

This is hands down the BEST home made ice cream cake ever!  It's the birthday standard in our house, though I have to say i've never really followed the recipe exactly! I usually use graham crackers (regular or chocolate) for the crust and have made the filling with lots of different flavors of ice cream. Mint chocolate chip with a chocolate crust has been the favorite so far. It's a great recipe for kids and creativity!

This was a HUGE hit at a dinner party that I hosted, as well as a company cook-out!  I used the graham cracker crust (only used 8 oz), and vanilla pudding with cookies and cream ice cream. Then topped it off with with the cool whip and some oreo cookies for some decoration on top.

Everyon raved about it!  Next timeI'll try the healthy route, and use frozen yogurt and fruit!

A very easy recipe.  I adapted to fit my family due to my children being allergic to nuts.  I used 1 package butterscotch and 1 package vanilla pudding.  I didn't mix any candy bars inside.  Instead I opted to spinkle the top with a mixture of graham cracker crumbs and crushed butterscotch morsels...YUM YUM

The cake tastes good, but honestly, it just ends up tasting like pudding with crust. Why go through the trouble?

Also, 16 ounces of crackers was WAY too much. I ended up throwing half of the crust mixture away, and the crust I used was too crumbly because there wasn't enough butter for the amout of crackers.

This is really delicious, great texture from the pudding /ice cream mix.  I put mine in the freezer and just let it sit a few minutes before cutting.  I tried Reese’s peanut butter ice cream mixed with chocolate pudding and a ritz cracker crust ... adults loved it!! I also did a chocolate chip  ice cream and vanilla pudding combo wth vanilla wafer crust -very good but the adults loved the salty sweet combo of the chocolate and peanut butter.

A friend made this recipe for her birthday and shared it at our dance club.  It was SO good I ate multiple pieces.  She used birthday cake ice cream.

This is super easy and delicious! I also used graham crackers, butter, and sugar as other reviewers mentioned. I used a 1lb. box and had plenty of crumbs, maybe even a bit too much, to make a crust up the sides of the 13x9 pan. For the filling, I used cherry/vanilla ice cream with the vanilla pudding. Over the whipped topping, I sprinkled chunks of butter toffee almonds purchased in the bulk section. I used a mallet to break them into chunks in a plastic bag. YUM!
