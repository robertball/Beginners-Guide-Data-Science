YUM. I had been wanting to try kale chips, and then I saw this recipe. I rinsed and ripped up the kale and threw the pieces into a bowl. I poured in a small amount of olive oil and mixed it up so all the pieces were coated. Then I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I spread the pieces onto parchment paper on a baking sheet and baked them for 10 minutes at 350. I pulled the pan out, flipped them over, added the cheese, and then baked for another 4-5 minutes.  They came out great! YUM! I think I will make them again tonight because I still have plenty of kale leftover!

On impulse I bought a 1 pound bag of kale in the produce aisle; never had kale in my life. So glad I found this recipe! The kale was prewashed and cut into small pieces. All I had to do was tear off a few stems here and there and spread the kale out onto the sprayed baking sheets. Then I sprayed the kale with cooking spray and sprinkled with seasoned salt and garlic powder before topping the kale with cheese. I had a cheddar/jack mix. I took it from the oven too soon thinking it was going to burn; but I put it back in because it was not crisp. After the ten minutes I took it out and it was crisp and delicious! Make sure to bake long enough to make it crispy and you will like it.

Oh my gosh! I was so shocked at how good this was. I forgot to spray the pan, so I added a little olive oil to the top. I was skeptical, so I only made half of the bunch of kale, but immediately went back to make more. Sooooo good.

This was really good.  I didn't bother to shred my kale so much - the curls in the leaves 'caught' the the cheese really well.  I also sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder on top as well as the cheese.  I'll make this again.

Line the cookie sheet/s with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray(any flavor). Kale must be dry-use your salad spinner or blot dry with paper towels. Sprinkle kale with salt and pepper and any herbs/seasonings desired. Then sprinkle cheese on top and spray again. Bake as directed until crisp but not burned.

This was surprisingly simple and very good. You have to like the flavor of kale. I did just as the recipe called for and used a few different kinds of cheese. Be careful, there is a fine line between crispy and burned, but even a little over done is still pretty good. Tearing the kale was a little time consuming, but the result was great and different!

My whole family liked this.  My daughter and I liked it better without cheese, until my son added salt.

Surprisingly delicious. Even my 11 year old loved it. I sprinkled sea salt, pepper and garlic powder over chopped kale leaves then topped with a mix of shredded jack/colby and mozzarella cheeses. I used a plastic box of precut kale, which filled one baking sheet after I chopped it up. I used probably a cup of cheese sprinkled on top. Absolutely yummy!

This recipe was fantastic.  I couldn't really follow amounts and don't know what a bunch of kale is as I just had a big bag of prewashed so I just barely covered the baking sheet I used with the kale and then sprinkled it with enough cheese to glue it together.  I did watch it rather carefully towards the end and waited until it was a nice golden brown before removing it from the oven. A bit longer then the 10 minutes in the original recipe. I'm sure everyone's ovens are different and that should be taken into account.  This is a great way to get nutritous greens into kids.  This definitely is a do-over recipe for me.  Can't wait to play with the ingredients a bit too, parmesan, different spices, etc.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good.  I used a chopping knife to get it down to small pieces.  I tossed it lightly with some olive oil & butter. I put down parchment paper instead of spraying the sheet.  I just sprinkled the cheese on top of each pile.  Note: make big heaping piles bc it bakes down significantly. Enjoy!!

Hot veggie mama! 10 STARS! I have to admit I already loved kale when I decided to try this recipe. I knew I would like it but this was over the top. I have made it with many kinds of cheese and everyone of them was excellent. My personal favorite at the moment is feta. I also like it with a bit of garlic powder and black pepper. Kale is also very high in iron so eat up ladies!

My kids actually ate this and I didn't even care for it.  I sprinkled them with salt & pepper and garlic powder before baking.      I still can't believe my kids ate this (one is almost 6 and the other is 4!!)

I prefer kale chips baked the traditional way, without the cheese.  In my opinion, the cheese made the dish very heavy.  Also, mine was not truly "crisp" but more like lightly sauteed spinach.  It was OK, but I probably won't make it again.

i can't not make this when i get kale in my csa box.  so easy and so yummy.  the hardest part is cleaning the kale, which can be kind of tedious.  be careful not to overcook, it takes less than a minute for these to go from perfect to burned.  sometimes i'll chop up leeks or spinach and add it to the kale, or sprinkle it with garlic salt for more flavor.

Very good use of the kale as it takes out some of the natural bitterness kale has.  One tip - rather than shred the kale, roll a few leaves like you would basil and chop thin. Quick and easy. I will definitely make it again.

My family doesn't care for kale, but they ate all of this.  Don't add too much cheese, or they don't crisp up before over browning.

Lordy, this was gooooood!!!  And so simple!  Gives the old saying "less is more" a definite exclamation point!  Didn't have kale on hand so I used spinach instead, and it was wonderful.  Going to make it again (and again!) when I find some kale.

My family loved these...the first time i've used kale and had no idea what to do with it. My kids were skeptical at first but loved them. Be sure the kale evenly distributed (level) and don't skimp on the cheese...my second batch turned out perfect. Also no need to wait in adding cheese or spray with Pam. Garlic salt and pepper were perfect.

I have never cooked with kale before and this was pretty amazing! I was suprised at how good it was considering how few ingredients it requires. I added salt and garlic powder like some of the other reviewers and it was delish! I loved the crispy texture of the kale. I will definatly be making this again!

Interesting flavor but very messy to eat, although with enough cheese, any vegetable can taste good.  I probably won't use this again.  It was a little greasy (from the cheese) but it probably would work better with a drier cheddar (like an English aged cheddar).

I added sliced Portabella Mushrooms. Yummy. I also added Garlic powder, onion powder and sea salt before the cheese, per a previous poster.

Before trying this recipe, I tried just making the chips with just oil and seasoning.  Although these tasted nice, having cheese over the top did things to texture that made it not as easy to eat (they kind of disintegrated) or attractive to serve.  It might work better with a cheese that is more dry like Parmesan, which I may try sometime, but I think they work better with a lower oven temp. and just plain olive oil.

This was fantastic!  Even my picky preschooler ate it!  Followed directions exactly, but I baked for just a couple extra minutes to really crisp the kale.  The leftovers were just as good cold. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this with baby kale which I think makes a big difference.  My son and I weren't fans with the regular kale, but with the baby..OH my goodness!! We both loved it.  Thanks

Delicious!  I am addicted to this stuff.  To change it up I use different kids of cheeses... Feta is also really good!

It doesn't even make sense how good this is! I made a little personal serving to make sure it passed for a potluck tomorrow. Not only am I making it at the potluck, I'm making a second serving for myself!

Yum!!! This is a great alternative to junk food when my crunchy/salty cravings kick in.  Of course I love spicy things, so adding a dash of red pepper flakes to this made it even better!

This recipe got me to try kale, so that was good.  I wasn't sure how big a "bunch" of kale is, so we kind of estimated on that & I think we used a little too much cheese & it was really greasy.  On one cookie sheet, I made 1/3 with cheddar cheese, 1/3 with cheddar cheese & sea salt, and 1/3 with garlic powder & Parmesan cheese.  My husband & I both liked the Parmesan cheese section the best (although it stuck to the pan the most).

I wouldn't give this any stars, it's simply baked cheese--yes the Kale crisped ,but it was too chewy under the cheese. I like kale but not this way. Sorry.

Not sure if it was supposed to look like a glob of cheese with kale mixed in, but it tasted good...did I do something wrong? Not sure if I let it cook long enough. Not good looking enough to serve to friends, but a great way of getting rid of left over kale :)

While 2 cups of cheese sounds like overindulgence to me, this recipe has lots going for it. Basically, what it is is roasted kale. And the kale takes surprisingly well to roasting. Parts which are exposed  become dessicated and the whole takes on the charred flavor of a roast beef. It is a unique dish, which lends itself to tearing off pieces. Of course it is  also very healthy.

Yummy & easy. I used triple washed and shredded kale that I picked up in a 1 lb bag at my local grocer. Only used about 1/2 cheese. Loved it. Like kale nachos.

Didn't really work for me. Kale stayed moist under the cheese and the cheese slipped off when I tried to pick up the pieces.

These are incredible! I don't like potato chips and junk food and am always looking for a healthy crunchy alternative, these are at the top of the list!  Even my 6 and 4 year old devoured them!  I am going to do this recipe with spinach also and keep them on hand. Good way to sneak in veggies for the kids!

This just didn't do it for me.  Maybe I just don't like kale that much.  Texture was ok, though and it was nice and crisp.

I think it took a bit more than 5 minutes to prepare because I removed the rib with a sharp knife then tore into pieces.   A reviewer had suggested adding coarse salt which I like.  Unfortunately, I used too much and most of it needed an immediate glass of water.  I will make it again leaving the salt on the table for anyone who wants to add it.  I tasted raw kale which was not good, but the cheese saved it and it the pieces without the salt were very yummy

I just signed up for a CSA this spring, so I was new to kale & was looking for a good recipe when I saw this one....and was SO glad I found it! My son said they were awesome and hubby and I agreed! A fabulous way to use kale and it makes a perfect appetizer! I definitely will be making these again!

I thought for sure I had burned this b/c after 10 minutes it wasn't done so I put it back in with the intention of pulling it out in a minute or two but got busy and forgot about it.  It came out almost perfectly done so I'm not so sure the cooking time on this is accurate.  It tasted great - I wa suprised b/c kale didn't seem too appealing to me but I had gotten some in a bountiful basket and didn't want it to go to waste.

I made this for my lady and myself to snack on while watching a movie. We both really liked it and will make it again. I coated kale with EVO and sprinkled it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then baked it and turned it and put cheese on and finished baking. Fantastic!!

I lined a baking sheet with wax paper lined the kale (which was tossed in olive oil and adobo) on top of the wax paper quite thick, sprinkled the cheese and baked for what felt like forever before it started to smoke and looked almost burnt. It actually was perfect. My two youngest kids thought it was the neatest thing to pick the stuff off the tray and it was crunchy and gooey. They didn't even let it cool down a minute before picking. I'm not sure if it was just the novelty though because half the pan was still there the next morning and I tossed it. Half a pan of greens in my kid's belly is a success to me though. I will make this again but only if I'm looking for a way to use up the Kale before it goes bad.

I thought these were great. I salted w/a little bit of garlic salt, chopped up just removing the stems & had a great snack. Great way to use up that extra kale quickly.

Wow! These were delicious. I added garlic powder and sea salt and just lightly sprinkled with cheese. My husband does not like kale but I had him try these and he loved them. We will definitely be making these again!

Good use for kale.  Quick, easy.  Husband and son didn't care for, but I really liked it for something different.  At like chips, satisfied my salty tooth. More of a snack.

I enjoyed them, but prefer my kale chips without cheese.

I will make this again..I did vary with the cheese, I used sharp cheddar and parm.  ..I also added some bacon bits on top!  Don't put the kale so thick..it will be to wet to crisp. I've never liked Kale until now!

I had leftover chard so I threw that in as well and used cheddar and mozzarella  cheese as well as some chopped green onions, but I think with just Kale and cheddar it would be great too.  Great idea!  It's like a kale cheese crisp!

I've made these so often that I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore. I'm an adult who struggles to eat my vegetables, but love to chow down on these. I've made them both with and without cheese, and they come out great either way. If using cheese, I usually add it about half way through, that way the kale can get some crispness first. If you add it before cooking, you'll get some tasty but soggy kale.

It was crispy on the edges and a bit softer on the inside of the cookie sheet.   I used low fat mexican cheese.  I find kale a bit bitter and too chewy, dry.  I did cut the kale  into little pieces, maybe using the whole leaf would have been better.

I've made this several times - it is awesome! I purchase pre-cleaned kale (even used chopped frozen one time)  in a one pound bag, spread it on parchment paper, add some spices like garlic powder, adobe seasoning, cayenne, paprika, or whatever for a little taste kick, and finely grate cheese over it, whatever cheese I have handy or sounds good at the time. The trick for me to getting it perfectly  crisp is to turn the oven off after 10-15 minutes and allow the kale to dehydrate at a lower temperature. If I'm concerned about it burning I leave the oven door open a little while to allow the temperature to decrease prior to dehydrating at a lower temperature. Turns out great every time!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

Ok, this is a good recipe but I made some changes. I tried what one reviewer said about tossing with olive oil but that weighted down the kale so they didn't turn out right.  Then I did what another reviewer stated about spreading the kale on the baking sheet and spraying with cooking spray....much better! Also added salt, pepper and garlic powder and cooked for 10 minutes. They came out great!

I was sitting here this afternoon thinking about a snack. I generally choose  something to have with peanut butter, but then thought I want something else.  I always have kale in the fridge as I use Kale for all my salads.  That's when I came across this recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  I did season my kale as I wanted a more salt/spicy snack.  Between my son and myself the bunch was gone in 10 minutes.  Thank you for sumitting!!!!!

I haven't made this yet, but I love kale chips.  I'm thinking that just a bit of fresh nutmeg grated in the the cheese would add a nice flavor, with just a pinch of cayenne for flavor, not heat.  I'll let you know.

Made the critical mistake of using olive oil instead of cooking spray and my kale burnt to a crisp after 8 minutes. It smelled great until that happened! :-(

FREAKING AWESOME! I have to eat a lot of greens due to my being fairly anemic, and this was an easy way to do it. I used 2% cheddar and even the HUBS loved it (though can't say I was able to get my daughter to pop some in her mouth!)

Totally delish!! I used walnut oil on it and topped it with Wensleydale, Red leicester and a bit of parmesan. I also drizzled the juice of a quarter lemon over the top and sprinkled with a bit of salt.   Fabulous recipe!!

So easy and so good!  Thank you for a great and quick way to use up all of the Kale from our CSA.
