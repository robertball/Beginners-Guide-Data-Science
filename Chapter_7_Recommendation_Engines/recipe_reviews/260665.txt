after first cook I made adjustments and cooked it in an Instant Pot. It's now a chili, I changed to Chile powder instead of Taco Seasoning.
I replaced ingredients:
4 TBSP chili powder
Â½ TSP Oregano
1 TSP Paprika
2 TSP Cumin
4 TBSP Red Miso Powder
4 TBSP Vegi Broth Powder ( I use Seitenbacher Vegetable Broth & Seasoning)
2 TBSP Coconut milk Powder

Very popular in my house hold now!

After reading the recipe carefully I decided to make one change from the start. Instead of 2 cans of 3 bean mix I just doubled the black beans and the pinto beans. I already had them on hand and the green and wax beans from the 3 bean mix just didn't seem to fit. With that being said, this was a good soup. I think it needed more seasoning though so I added another packet of taco seasoning mix and that turned it into a great soup. Thanks for sharing!
