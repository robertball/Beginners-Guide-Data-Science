I didn't make changes to the recipe, and I can confirm the apple pie is great. Just forget the cheese. After refrigeration the cheese is hard and dry
 Even reheating didn't improve it. The poured on treatment was excellent and the crust was outstanding.  It will be my go-to for apple pie. BTW, I used gala apples.

I made this pie and love the creamy sauce inside. My husband loves the cheese aspect because he never has enough cheese in his diet... Lol. 
It's delicious and the next day for breakfast with a cup of coffee too. Yum
