This is my recipe and I'm telling you not to make it.  It was published before I could make the necessary adjustments.  I live in high altitude and the recipe works really well at this level but will collapse at lower levels.  If you want to try it add 1/3 cup extra flour, cut the milk to 1/2 cup, and don't use the almond.  Actually, I take candy canes and pulverized them into a powder and use 1 cup of that plus 1 cup of sugar (instead of the 2 cups of sugar).  It gives it  better taste.  Sorry about this recipe.

I first want to say that the only change I made was to halve the recipe (to make 12 cupcakes). There didn't seem to be enough batter to fill all 12 cupcake liners even 1/2 full - but I just divided the batter among the 12 liners and hoped for the best. The batter did puff up to fill the liners while baking, but then they collapsed in the middle, leaving a crunchy outer rim around the edge of the cupcake and a sunken middle. I baked them for the full 20 minutes, hoping they would raise back up again in the middle, but they never did. The frosting was difficult to work with as well. I was hoping to be able to pipe it with a star tip, but I could see that wasn't going to happen, so I just snipped the end of my pastry bag and just created a circle swirl.  The frosting is VERY sweet, almost too sweet for me (and I have a major sweet tooth). Because of this, I knew I wasn't going to be able to leave that big dent in the middle of the cupcakes and fill it with the frosting. I ended up unwrapping 3 of the cupcakes, breaking them into pieces to use to fill the hole in the remainder of the cupcakes. The cake part, by itself is very tasty - but unfortunately, this recipe just didn't work for me. Sorry!

I made these last Christmas, exactly as written (I was a completely novice baker, so too scared to change a thing) & they were a nightmare. They came out so sunken, I could have used them as tart shells. They were ridiculously dense, dry & still somehow sticky. The frosting was enough to make me swear off marshmallow whip forever - absolutely horrendous to mix. After a year of baking at least 1 thing a week, every week, I now know these are beaten WAY too much & the proportions are just out of whack. I like the flavor combo though, so used a GOOD vanilla cupcake recipe & subbed pepp extract for vanilla, then made a 7-minute frosting flavored with marshmallow extract (got it at my local bakery) & they were fantastic.

I’ve used this recipe 3 times (ultimately to serve as a Christmas cake.) I increased the peppermint extract to 1.5 teaspoons, omitted the almond extract and used 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead (just due to preference in my household). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Luckily I didn’t have any issues with the cake sinking. 

The first time, I baked in two 9-inch rounds. The layers came out too flat to present as a double layer cake. (BTW I wonder if the recipe means to say 24 mini cupcakes, as I don’t see how you could get 24 standard cupcakes.) But the flavor and texture were very nice so I decided to try again.

The second and third times I doubled everything (including minor adjustments noted above). This amount worked perfectly for three 9-inch rounds.  

I didn’t use the icing recipe. Instead I used my favorite buttercream to which I added a little peppermint extract for extra minty flavor. As the recipe owner suggested, I sprinkled crushed peppermint candy on top of the cake, and also around the cake serving plate for a festive touch. Thanks for the unique and tasty “Christmas” cake recipe!

Had really high hopes for these peppermint cupcakes.  I should have read all of the reviews first before making.  The batter seemed like a great consistency.  Like the others, my cupcakes puffed up in the oven and then fell like a souffle.  I tried to salvage them.  I took the overrun off and crumbled it into a bowl.  The flavor of the cupcakes was wonderful, which is why I gave these three stars.  I made a chocolate ganache to fill the areas that were sunk in.  I mixed the crumbs into the ganache and spread it onto the cupcakes.  A little while later, I made the frosting.  I had never made nor eaten a marshmallow frosting before.  I must have done something wrong because it was awful.  I tried spreading some with a knife; there was no way I could get that frosting in or out of a pastry bag.  I was so disappointed with the end product.  I had made these specifically for a bake sale.  Thankfully, I had two other things that I made as well.  The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and no almond extract.  Like I said, the flavor of the cupcakes is good.  I might work with the recipe some more to see if I can get them to bake better.

These were pretty good cupcakes. I didn't make the frosting, since I didn't have the ingredients for it.
