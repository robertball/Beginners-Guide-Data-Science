Really nice!  I had some trouble finding the instant tea mix - none of our supermarkets had it (they just had iced tea mix), but finally found it at Walmart.  Only change I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar.  My hot beverage of choice is coffee, but I drink too much of it in the winter.  This will be a replacement for me.  (I don't care for hot cider).  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! Just like my mom made when I was little! Since, I adore cinnamon, I put in a full teaspoon. I also made a cup with 4 spoonfuls and it was delicious!

I've been making a version of this for years, but I substitute Splenda for the sugar and also add 1 cup of sweetened powdered lemonade mix. It's easy and very flavorful.
