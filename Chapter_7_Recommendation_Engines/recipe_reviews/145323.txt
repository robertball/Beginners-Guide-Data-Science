Really fun way to change up your typical peanut butter and jelly lunch. GREAT for bigger kid bento lunches and really great way to see a kid go from bored to gleeful in a matter of seconds. This can totally work with organic peanut butter, homemade jam and any kind of bread you've got going on. Or whatever filling's you want to use, too. This was fun!

My kids made these, and ate these, all on their own!  A fun addition to any "bento".  We also made some rolls with turkey lunch meat and a cheese stick.  We rolled out the bread like in this recipe, then lined it with turkey, rolled up a cheese stick inside, and sliced it into the bite-sized pieces.  Next time we make these, I am going to try hummus and matchstick cucumber rolls!

I thought these were so cute! I made them for my boyfriend, but instead of jelly used honey. I also sliced up apples and bananas to add in! Top off with a little cinnamon and sugar! So delicious!   A little tip: I froze the rolls before I sliced them up, this made it easier to cut and gave the fruit  a little crunch!

My niece just loved this!  It was cute, easy, and fun to do!  I also happen to be a huge fan of anything with peanut butter so I didn't mind helping her eat them.....  Perfect with an ice cold glass of milk.

In my search of lunch ideas for my first grader this year, I stumbled upon this cute idea. My son will eat almost anything. BUT he is really a messy eater! I'm trying to find things that he'll enjoy but that he won't be wearing on his shirt for the rest of the school day ;) This fits the bill perfectly as he can just pop each roll in his mouth. I used a tad too much jelly, next time I'll use just a bit less. I don't want it to ooze out of the sides so much. Really cute idea, I'm sure I will be making this weekly!

Made these for my girls for lunch and they thought they were something special, especially since mom and dad are sushi lovers =)  I found it was best to flatten the bread, cut it into four strips and then add the peanut butter and jelly then roll.  Less mess and looks more presentable.

Anytime I make my 2 year old sandwiches he pulls them apart and makes a huge mess. I was looking for something different, and stumbled onto this recipe. I made it for him for lunch today and OMG! he LOVED it! He didn't pull it apart at all, he just sat and ate it. What a great recipe! I would have never thought to do that. I may try to do a ham and cheese w/ mustard sushi roll next time, b/c that's his favorite. Will DEFINATELY be making this for him again!

Cute, quick and creative lunch.  They were fun and artful to make, however after squishing the bread the rolls were VERY tiny, and I could only cut 3 (tiny-sized) sushi pieces out of each one.  I give it 3 stars because it was unique, quick and easy and it was of average taste.

These were great. Very kid friendly. Something unexpected and different. Don't let them sit out long, because the bread starts to get dry and hard.

I made these for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  They were a little time consuming to make with a whole loaf of white bread but turned out pretty cute.  The bread seemed to dry out fairly quickly.  The texture of the bread turned a bit rough on the outside although these disappeared quickly.  Both kids and adults enjoyed these cute little snacks!

Don't completely flatten bread or it will stick to whatever surface you flattened it on. Or use waxed paper or parchment since a paper plate didn't work well. Mine didn't look anything like the picture and were messy to eat with the filling oozing out when you took a bite. Cute idea, but not impressive.

These were yummy, but they just didn't end up looking like I thought they would. I have made these a couple of times, trying all the suggestions that I read in the reviews, but they just don't look right, they kind of look messy. I still make these though because my little brother asks for them weekly! :)

Did not really work.  I used wheat bread, skippy creamy PB, and my cousin's homemade jelly.  The bread was too thin, and wouldn't roll.  I ate a PB&J flatbread instead- WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN!!!

This is the most adorable way to serve PB&J! I flattened 2 pieces of WW bread, spread creamy PB on one slice, grape jam on the other, cut it once down the middle and rolled the 2 pieces tightly. I served them to my 3-year old along w/ romaine lettuce that I'd rolled w/ deli turkey & Jarlsberg cheese. She normally dissects sandwiches and eats all the parts separately, but she actually ate these "sushi sammies" as served.

I made these for a soccer team cookout.  They were ok except the jelly was soaking through the bread before we made it there so they were kinda soggy.  Perhaps it would have been better if they were made at home for lunch.

That was really fun to make AND eat! It's a little messy but in an entertaining way ?? I recommend using a cutting board for everything so you don't have to wipe off the confers afterwards. And hold tight when you cut it or else the roll gets smashed and unrolled

Super cute but very tiny. Kind of time consuming, they came together pretty quickly once I got the hang of it. Perfect size for toddlers!

This is such a cute idea.  I don't have kids, so I just made it for the fun of it.  It's quite easy, and you can use any type of jelly or add fruit, et cetera.  I thought it would be fun to make for a snack with fruit today, and it was.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for a coworker who sticks to the staple foods in life. At first she laughed, but she ate them all and was very thankful I included her in our "food day" in a small, personal way. Cute idea, I'm sure my young cousins would enjoy these as well.

Though I wouldn't make it like this all the time, this was a great idea! 2 out of the 3 kids that ate it loved it.  The other one wasn't so sure and opted out!  I thought it was a cute idea and brought new life to a classic. I will be making this again.  The first one I made was a little globby so the chef ate that one ;-)  Make them right and they aren't as messy ;-)  Thanks for sharing this. It was a fun tea party snack :)

I made this for my boyfriend's 2 year old who is an extremely picky eater and he actually ate it! :) I made two 'sushi rolls' and put them on the plate as 'eyes' and sliced black olives (his FAVORITE) in half and made a nose and a mouth with them. I figured he might try something new if I made it fun - it worked! Thanks so much! This was fun to make too.

I was really hoping it would have looked like the cover photo. Mine were really, really small. I will try it again but may put the 2 pieces of bread together first to get some bulk to it.

Sooooooo cute ! I have been making sushi at home for a few months so I'm still a novice and I was looking for some other sushi recipes when I came across this. I just got up to make them right away for my kids. They loved them....big smiles on their faces while eating them with chopsticks ! Thanks for this quick and easy idea!

Oh! how cute this P.B&J sushi recipe looked. I was looking for a california roll recipe and saw this one and thought how cute it would be to instantly get up from the computer to try it out. Take it easy on the rolling pin. Try not to roll the bread too thin. Great idea to help sell those tired old PBJ's to the kiddies. LOVE IT!!!

What a PERFECT combination for my kids.  They love sushi and they love pb&j.  To combine the 2 was a match made in heaven for them.  Packed well for lunch, although mine didn't look quite as pretty as the picture.  Must've still tasted good though because I didn't get any complaints!!

These were great! I made both Pb& J & I also made the sun dreied tomato hummus and cucumber with a dash of fresh pepper. Ohhh my they are vegitarian and delicious! Highly reccomended. Will make often. Note* with the jelly i believe it might be better to just add to one side of bread.

This is such a cute idea. I made this as a quick snack this evening, using raspberry preserves. But my rolls didn't turn out looking like any of the pics. I think I rolled my bread too flat which made cutting them a total mess and pain. But I like the idea so I am going to make it again and not roll out the bread that thinly next time. Thanks for posting.

This is really a great recipe! I remember my babysitter teaching me how to make these when I was a kid, and now I am teaching my daughter how to make them! A blossoming young chef, she loves to help and can even make these on her own! Very fun, can make just about any sandwich this way, but the classic pb&j is always a fav! :)

This was a fun and easy recipe that my kids could actually do on their own. I only helped by cutting the crusts and the rolls. My niece wants this to be a dish at her next birthday party.

These were simply delicious! They were hard to make at first because I had trouble cutting them but then I had some other minds come help me solve it and wouldn't ya know it worked. These are great when I don't just want an ordinary PB&J. I actually eat them with chop sticks also! Its so much fun!

Made this for my 6 year old daughter for a suprise snack and she loved them. Creative and easy to make! Plan on making them for my 12 year olds lunch. She takes peanut butter and jelly to school almost every day so this will be a nice twist. We use the Candy Apple jelly recipe from allrecipes. Yummy!

My kids love these! My oldest, who is 5 asks to take these for snack at school every day. The only thing I do different is I leave the crust on. My boys don't seem to notice since they are all rolled up.

Just ran across this and I got such a kick out of it because I started making these when my kids were in pre-school. A small "fun lunch" is so perfect for little ones who are just starting school and may become intimidated with a whole sandwich. Thanks for the memories!
