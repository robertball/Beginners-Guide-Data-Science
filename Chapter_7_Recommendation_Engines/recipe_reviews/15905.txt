Unique and delicious cake! I made a punch bowl cake with chocolate cake (box mix), chocolate pudding and whipped cream. It was delicious and super easy.

light and delicious. exactly what i wanted. i added strawberries. And, I made a mistake and got cook n' serve vanilla pudding. And not enough.. so i had to end up with one layer of the cook n' serve pudding, and one layer of the vanilla instant pudding that my mom had already that was past its "best used by" date. it was still delicious and no one died. :-D

This recipe was delicious! Thanks so much. Instead of making cake mix.. I used Sara lee's sliced pound cake, just a little short cut! Excellent for parties

Another name for a Trifle...this recipe can be modified by using different flavor cakes, puddings and fruits. I prefer to use fresh whipping cream instead of frozen whipped topping and also homemade vanilla custard (when I make it that flavor) As mentioned, chocolate and pistachio puddings will work with other flavor cakes. You can also use an orange cake, mix well drained crushed pinapple with the vanilla pudding and top with mandarin oranges. Any deep glass bowl will work and it always looks and tastes great!

I got all the ingrediants together and had my 6 and 3 year old nephews make this dessert (with a little help) as thier part of a Mother's Day lunch.  Of course all the Mom's loved it even more because the kids made it.  It was a refreshing dessert that was a hit!

Anything is PERFECT when you use Red Velvet Cake MIX(with a splash of Godiva chocolate liquer)!! I layered it with frozen whipped topping, white chocolate instant pudding and diced strawberries. then i topped this amazing cake off with shaved chocolates and dipped strawberries. YUM!!

We changed this up and served it in single serving wine glasses. We have about 15 birthdays in August, so everyone who had a birthday got their own. Looked fantastic, and everyone loved it! Changed it for each persons preferences, ie; Dad likes German chocolate (coconut, chocolate cake, choc pudding), Mom likes berries (chocolate cake, strawberry, vanilla pudding), son prefers candy stuff (white cake, Skittles, swirled pudding), etc...buy single serving premade puddings to make it easier :)
