I must admit, I was afraid of this recipe.  Have you ever seen a crawfish?  I'm a Southerner and had never eaten it, but this recipe intrigued me.  The texture is a blend between a cornbread and a casserole, so the name is a bit misleading but...........I really liked it!  If I make it again, I would add some more seasoning, maybe some minced garlic and Old Bay.  It definitely reminded me of something you would find at a Southern family reunion--comforting and somewhat mysterious ; ).

I've had many versions of crawfish cornbread, but they're usually dry. This one is great! I like to add cajun seasoning. The original recipe is a little mild for my family, but it's still very good.

I used crab instead of crawfish and added some creole seasoning. The whole family fell in love!

Made it exactly as written the first time. It’s a good starting point. Second time I added crab and shrimp. Better. Third time I added some golden mushroom soup, crab, shrimp, chopped up sausage and a little bell pepper but omitted the pimentos.  Fourth time I added all of the above but used a commercial “honey sweet” cornbread mix. As the man says “Bam!!”
 Grandkids, “Chicken nugget and Pizza roll”  ate it and asked for more. It’s a real good starting point recipe that can be adjusted and made to fit your families taste.

Fantastic! I had to quit making it for church dinners cause people got mad if they didn't get a piece. My only change is to use red bell peppers instead of pimentoes.

Awsome! I hate changing recipes, but living where I do, I have no access to crawfish, so used prawns instead. This one is a "keeper"

really enjoyed this recipe, although I did not use the pimentos and will use a lil less jalapeno next time I make this recipe, I also sprinkled old bay on the crawfish before I mixed them in...but I took it to a mardi gras parade and when I told everyone what it was, it was gone in no time!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Hands down this was delicious and really easy. Don't let the lengthy ingredient list intimidate you!  Instead of the cornmeal, baking soda and tsp of salt I used a box of Jiffy Cornbread mix.  I didn't have pimentos so left them out.  I used Mexican blend cheese rather than just cheddar (it's what I had on hand) and I had the crawfish in freezer from a previous boil so they were already seasoned.   Oh and I chopped up one whole de-seeded jalapeño.  I also chopped my crawfish into smaller pieces.  Toss it all together, bake and you have an amazing meal. It is more of a casserole than cornbread.  We loved it and will be making again in very near future!!

I will definitely make this again.  Didn't have the full amt of crawfish tails but it was great anyway.  Used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses and Tony's seasoning.  Dee-lish.  Husband loved : )

I am Cajun and I feel like I wasted my crawfish in this. If I ever made this again I would use sweet cornbread mix instead.

Make it in your slow cooker, same amount of time, maybe a little more!! I made changes that I could to reduce the salt. Absolutely will make again and again.

When I read the other reviews about how it’s almost like a casserole instead of cornbread, I doubled the cornmeal, salt, vegetable oil, eggs, and baking soda and mixed those ingredients together in their own bowl. Then I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Old Bay Seasoning and it came out to be a moist cornbread and still loaded with all the veggies and crawfish tails!

I found a recipe like this back in the late 1990's and made it for years,  a really unique & different side dish.  Never trued with shrimp, but has got to be delish!

The flavor is good, I tried 4 eggs instead of 2 to make it more cornbread than casseroleEpic fail it was stuffing. This recipe has to many add ins for the cornbread to be cornbread. It smells amazing and I enjoy the flavor.

I just made this & it is delish!!!  As someone previously noted, its not very 'bready' but it does have lots of flavor.  I split it into 2 8X8 pans since I am giving some of it away.  I do think it could use maybe another 1/4 cup of cornmeal with some cajun seasoning (which I forgot to add).  Will definitely make again...and again!!!

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few minor changes/substitutions based on other reviews and I couldn’t be happier. No major changes were made, just a few tweaks so I could make it with what I had on hand. I used a box of Jiffy in lieu of cornmeal, salt and baking powder. I also used a chopped red bell pepper in place of the pimentos. I added about 1 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and a package of lump crab meat, along with the crawfish tails. It was fabulous! As others have pointed out, it is more of a casserole than a bread. Really, it is a quick and easy crawfish stuffing. Regardless, it is well worth the minimal time and effort required to whip this dish up. I will definitely be hanging on to this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was WONDERFUL!  I made it exactly per recipe (using frozen, pre-cooked crawfish tail meat).  I t was for a ladies' luncheon... and most raved about it, and went back for seconds!  It will definitely be a "do again".  
I'm wondering... would shrimp work instead of the crawfish?  (Crawfish is a bit difficult to find).

Out of this world!  Used shrimp as crawfish season hasn’t started yet. Even better leftovers the next day. Definitely a keeper recipe.  Used Betty White cornbread mix instead of corn meal/baking soda/salt.  Another version uses Jiffy Mix.

Used a jiffy cornbread mix in lieu of the cornmeal.  Was just the right amount of crawfish.  Would like to use in season crawfish rather than prepackaged material.  Didn’t do “made in China” crawfish but rather farm raised in Louisiana.  Served with black eye peas on news years day.

My wife and I were in agreement that this is one of the best things we’ve ever eaten.
I went mostly by the recipe but left out the pimento and used red and orange bell pepper.  Probably a little more jalapeño than called for too.
Pretty easy to make and sooooooo good.

I used a # of lump crabmeat instead of the crawfish.  The recipe was good.  Quick and easy! Will definitely try again with crawfish and perhaps even shrimp.

Hello, I work for a non-profit watershed restoration group on Vancouver Island, Canada called The Tsolum River Restoration Society. We currently have a large problem with invasive American Bullfrogs and are looking to create a cookbook that would encourage others to hunt these frogs for food. Our river also has an abundance of Crayfish and we'd like to include them as well. Would it be possible to use your recipe in a book used for outreach, educational, and possible fundraising purposes? We would credit you of course and include your username.

I have NEVER reviewed a recipe!  This one is very worthy of a review.  I too was skeptical after reading the recipe.  I didn’t want to use my crawfish tails I spent a lot of time peeling on a bad recipe.  The only tis no pimento and use half red half green bell pepper and sautéed all veggies in butter before hings

Oh My Goodness! This was so good. I did not have an onion so used green onions and used a package of cornbread mix. I also used  a red bell pepper instead of pimento with the green bell pepper.  We will have the leftovers tomorrow for left-over day. This will be made again and again.

Could be good but had no flavor. Will try to make it again but add lots of seasoning.

Add some sugar to your cornbread and 1 lbs of small shrimp to this recipe and it moves to 5 stars.  This is really good.

Only had self-rising white corn meal on hand so omitted the baking soda. Omitted the pimento, added fresh minced garlic, green onion, and celery, plus some creole seasoning as well. Cut jalapeno to one-fourth cup. Everything else as stated in the recipe. Served this with black eyed peas and collards. A major hit! Already added to my favorite recipes.

My dish resembled a crayfish stuffing and NOT any version of a casserole. I also added blackened seasoning to the fish. It was good, but by no means any sort of meal.
