wonderful, I will make it again.  It was so tender and the tomato mixture very  flavorful. As another reviewer commented, I started it skin side up then flipped it to finish

This was loved by all, even though I made substitutions for food allergies and preferences. This was flexible enough to allow for it. This will definitely make a return to our table. 

I list the substitutions made to encourage anyone else to try this recipe, even if you don't have everything in your cupboard or for food allergies, etc. 

The Tomato Topping actually became a carrot and beet mixture (both from canned and then roughly smashed). The  Pinot Gris became Pinot Noir (the only wine we had). The fresh minced red onion got roasted (we don't like raw onion).  
The cod became pollock and my husband noted the pollock had a nice texture to it. He couldnâ€™t tell it had wine in the topping - and he didn't recognize the mostly carrot base - thinking the topping was made from tomatoes. 

Anyone would love this dish who loves a quick dish with a combination of veggies and white fish. Thanks for sharing!

Perfect fish dish!
I did my own tweaking, too, not because I thought it won't be good, but because I wanted everything to be warm :) and we loved, loved, loved this dish!!
I added the tomatoes and the parm during the broiling period- I broiled the fish for 5 min, too as the fish was quite thick...

So easy, cheap, healthy, and delicious! Only change I made was using olive oil instead of butter (healthier) and pecorino instead of parm (that's what i had). Perfect addition to our Mediterranean Diet rotation. I bet this would be great with salmon too.

Delicious!  I didn't have any lettuce on hand, so I served the tomato mixture on the side.  I also added more basil.  I think next time I may try substituting coconut oil for the butter to make it healthier, but still keep some of the butter for flavor.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

The fish melted in my mouth-- it was delicious!  I loved the flavor of the fresh basil, tomatoes, garlic, parmesan, and the black cod... excellent!  I only had grated parmesan on hand, and it tasted "grate"  haha (next time I will use shredded).  The only change we would make is to put in a bit less of the raw red onion, as it carried a pretty strong flavor.  Also, I think there was a misprint in the recipe... it should start out with the fish going in the oven skin-side UP, not DOWN.  Then flip the fish over part-way through the baking process and add the mustard-butter sauce, then back in the oven skin-side DOWN.  
Overall, a definite keeper recipe!
