This stuffing was excellent! I always love turkey and stuffing, so I am always willing to try new recipes. I marinaded the turkey in my own little marinade, but the stuffing complemented it perfectly. We love "Bobbie" sandwiches, so we made ours into Thanksgiving sandwiches with cranberry sauce and a little bit of mayo. Yum!! Thank you!!

My rating is for the cornbread stuffing since I had a recipe that called for a boxed mix and being here in Canada we don't seem to have cornbread stuffing mixes so I had to look for a recipe. This stuffing was super easy to do, nice in color, texture and the taste is great! I crumbled this over a Mexican style dish and I even sprinkled cheddar cheese over the crumbled cornbread stuffing and it was soooo good.
