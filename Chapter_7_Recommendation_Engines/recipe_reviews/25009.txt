These were not good at all.  I made them with the Grand Marnier, which made them taste very strongly of the orange brandy (I've used the Grand Marnier in other recipes and been pleased, but in this recipe it was a bad addition).  I fed them to two other people, who did not care for them.  Now I have a whole panful that no one will eat more than one of.

I didn't have any special liqueurs on hand, so I used seedless jam instead!  I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet chips.  These were delicious, and what I liked most of all is that they are easy to cut and travel well.  Some brownies are practically destroyed by the time you cut them into squares, but not these!  Yum!

This recipe is fabulous! I did a search on the site for "unsweetened baking chocolate" which yielded many results, of course. I chose this one, thinking it would be just the thing for my chocolate craving. I was right! I didn't have any nuts on hand, but I did happen to have the rest of the ingredients and I found this recipe very easy to make. Instead of orange zest and Grand Marnier, I used 6 splashes of Chambord raspberry liqueur. Yummy!

These turned out really well but as usual I tweaked them a little bit.  I didn't have orange rind but I did use Cointreau and I would have liked more orange which the rind would have given so I won't knock them for that.  

I also didn't have baking chocolate, so I mixed cocoa and melted shortening together in the microwave (3T cocoa and 1T shortening for every ounce of baking chocolate).  Then I just melted the butter into that in the microwave to save cleaning a pot.

And I didn't have nuts (what did I have on hand??) so I just left those out.

Next time I'd add some salt - they're very sweet which is obviously a good thing, but they could just use a little salt to balance it out and bring out more of the chocolatey flavor.  I might also try cherry/almond instead of orange next time to see how that is.

Overall this recipe is a keeper - they turned out with just the fudgey texture I love in a brownie.

Loved the brownies, but I used pecans instead of walnuts.

it was super chocolate-y, which was great, but the texture was very dry, and yet dense.  i may not have let the chocolate/butter mixture cool enough before adding to the eggs/sugar mix?  the kids love them.

I doubled the recipe. I used 472g of dark chocolate with almonds, 1 cup of butter (halved from original,) 5 eggs (1 more than half,) 5 teaspoons vanilla, 6 cups of flour. My brownies stayed together fine and were quite moist. They didn't need the extra butter or eggs, and since my chocolate was already slightly sweet (it's like using semisweet chocolate,) I didn't add any sugar at all. They were plenty sweet.

I also made a blondie version in the exact same way, except that I used 1 small package butterscotch chips and 1 small package white chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate. I thought it was too sweet, so I'd cut down the amount of chips by 1/5 maybe.

I love the moist consistency of this recipe.  Instead of Grand Marnier I used my own brandied cherries.  Mmmmm!
