First of all, 'OMG AWESOME' Recipe!  I followed all of the ingredients exactly, but added a tbsp of garlic salt near the end, as my tastebuds like salt!  I will be making this recipe from now on whenever I make chili.... 10 stars!

On a side note, I noticed alot of people made their own recipes from this and added reviews about their chili on this recipe... People, you have your OWN recipe!  Don't add your review here if its completely different from the original!  Type up your OWN recipe on allrecipes.com instead of putting a review on something totally different....  It's like making a review about a BMW, when you drive a Mercedes.... it doesn't make sense!

It's been awhile since I have made this. This is quite hot using habanero's but if your even attempting this recipe hot is obviously what your looking for. The flavor is excellent just the way it is. Perfect! There is no such thing as too many peppers as the previous reviews stated. Good chili if spilled on the table should leave a burn mark in the wood. If for some reason you feel this is too hot you can always add a bit of sugar, this will eliminate some of the acidity hence taking a bit of heat from the chili. I don't recommend adding gobs of sugar or it will be too sweet. A bit of sweet ketchup or some baking soda will help too. This is our new family recipe from now on for chili. Thanks for posting it Edd! 
FYI, If you forget or do not wear gloves cutting the peppers your hands will burn, baking soda will help with this too. Take some hand soap and 3-4 tablespoons of baking soda and rub it in really good, let it sit on your hands a few minutes and rinse. Good as new!

Thanks for this recipe.  I just won 1st place in a chili cook-off out of 14 contestants!  I used the exact recipe, just added a tbsp of salt.  For those who have never heard of chili paste, I found it in the Asian section of the grocery store.

Very very good! It is hot of course but the taste is fantastic and yes, its easy to make. It is MUCH better after sitting in the fridge a day or two! After sitting it also does not seem as hot so next time we plan to add a bit more bacon, another habanero and two more cans of beans. But the first time we followed the recipe exact and it turned out fantastic. If you did not think much of it after making it please try throwing it in the fridge and reheat it well the next day, its a whole new chili after that!

I did cook longer as well, forgot to mention that. I cooked it for about 90 minutes then added bacon and beans. I had to run so I left it on low for about 3 hours after that. 

Also, for gloves I had a box of surgical gloves and that works GREAT. They fit so well to your hands they do not get in the way and after chopping the peppers can just be thrown out. A whole box is only a couple bucks.

i'm a vegetarian, so i had to change some of this up, obviously.  to any vegetarians browsing chili recipies, i say try this out.  what i did was instead of ground beef and pork, i simply used 2 and 2/3rds bags of morning star tofu crumbles.  for the bacon, i used morningstar bacon.  everything else i followed to a tee, except the chili beans.  all i could find were kidney beans, so i used those.  i also couldn't find habaneros at the store, so i used scotch bonnet peppers.  the result was absolutely delicious (and mmm! spicy!) and i gave some to some of my carnivorous friends who slopped it up.  a friend looked up and said "wait -- who did you make this for?  it must be awful making chili when you can't eat it."  i replied "i sure can!" and scooped some up with a chip.  they all stayed staring at me and i parried, "it's vegetarian!"  i got a unanimous "NO WAAAYYY!" hahahaha!  so i say give this a shot, and drop me a message with your results!

I was short by half the Anaheim peppers called for, but otherwise followed the ingredients exactly.  I pureed the tomatoes and peppers for a smooth chili, and the texture turned out just perfect.  I like very hot food, but this was a little too hot for even me!  Husband loved it as is, but he's obviously insane.  The proportions and flavor are perfect as-is, my only change will be to lose about half the peppers and see if I can eat more than a few bites next time!

Turned out really good. Obviously "hot" is relative since some people like really spicy foods and others don't. If you don't like spicy food, obviously find a different recipe. If you do, it's fantastic. Great flavor from this chili, not just all burn and no taste. Two things: may not want to use 2 cups of water. It was a little too soupy for my tastes, I like my chili thick. I'd cut it to 1 cup. Also, make it ahead of time. I made it on Saturday and stuck it in the fridge until Monday. Flavors blend together quite nicely as it ages. It tasted much better Monday than it did Saturday.

Yum-O!  I made this last night and can't wait to have some more today.  The only adjustments I made were adding half a bag of roasted corn from Trader Joe's & more garlic.  Used the roasted tomatoes from TJs as well the whole plum tomatoes. Then topped each bowl with marbled cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Hot & Spicy but still flavorful!

This was the best chili I have ever made. If you don't like VERY spicy foods, just reduce the ammount of peppers involved in the original recipe. Delicious!!

Six stars! It's our chili of choice; I start a new batch when we get down to a quart in the freezer. (Freezes well.)
In California, all (fresh) chilis are thankfully readily available, along with chili paste.
Slow cook overnight-10 hours min; reduces "heat" a little but seems to enhance flavor, if that's possible. (Plus, we get to enjoy the aroma upstairs all night long.)
Pepper seeds not removed; No Wimpy Chili!
No water used; another beer added at 3:00am.
Full pound of bacon.
Double amount of garlic (or triple).
When wife nukes a bowl for lunch at work, her workmates drool, ooh and ahh from the aroma wafting throughout the room.
We really love all-beef HHCdogs or on top of rice.
Thanks Edd Ryan; you've created a thing of beauty. Maybe it should be called Edd's Habanero Hellfire Chili?

Chili-licious! I must say that I am not a huge fan of chili, but this recipe has changed my opinion.  It was so flavorful, spicy and a great consistency. The only changes I made were:  omit the water (added alittle extra beer ), added about 1/4 Cup of brown sugar, and alittle extra garlic.  Prior to serving added the juice of one lime and then served with cilantro, sour cream and alittle cheddar cheese. Amazing! Took 3rd  out of 25 at a chili cook off :)

Great recipe! It's got some good kick to it. The only thing I changed was upping the spices to my personal tastes and adding an entire onion. Thanks for the recipe. We'll be having this one again.

I've gotten a LOT of compliments on this chili(first one I've ever made, or liked!). Changes: used a good IPA beer(Sierra Nevada), added only 1cup of water, added about 1 cup lt. brown sugar, 2x the garlic, 2x the red pepper flakes, diced tomatoes.  It's a great base recipe though, it's terrific the way it is; leaves your mouth with a satisfying tingle/numbness but not overpowering. There is also a lot of room for modifications and additions, everyone wants this recipe!

Fabulous!  All those peppers blend when cooked and mellow into a wonderful, deliciously spicy chili!  I would put the spice rating at 6+ on a 1-10 scale.  We used all of the peppers and added a bit of red wine, replaced one green pepper with an orange bell pepper (we doubled the recipe), used ale instead of beer, used no water, and lightened up on the meat by about a pound (again, we doubled it) & used chili sauce instead of chili paste.  Unbelievable~ we won our little chili/soup contest by a landslide out of about 10 chili's plus 6 or so other soups.

I make chili A LOT, and thought I might have hit the jackpot with this recipe.  Sorry, I had high hopes, but my family was "so so" about it.  They told me to stick with the one I make.

I grow my own Habeneros and Jalepenos but I only had 4 Habeneros at the time I made this, so it might have been called "heckfire chili".  Then again, my home grown varieties are smaller and hotter then grocery store ones so maybe not.

If you can't find whole Anaheim peppers, you might be able to find them dried.  New Mexico chili peppers work well too.  If there is a Latino grocery nearby you should be able to find them there.
If I am going to spend the 2 hours making this, I'll use dried beans instead of canned.  You will reduce the sodium and it will taste better.  Just boil them in a separate pot while you are cooking everything else, add some baking soda about 15 minutes before the end and drain before adding them in the chili.

Great recipe, like to add a few more beans to thicken things up and stretch it out a bit and if people complain about the spice I hand them some sour cream and/or cheese. Other than that always prepare as directed and it's always a hit.

this is the best chili ever.  Everyone I ever made it for loves it.  We will cook this out side during the colder months of October and all before the snow and it is a fun time.  becoming a tradition.  we make a huge batch with the pals and always taste test planty of the beer that we are going to add.  Then we enjoy a steaming batch of this hellish delight.  Best chili by far!

I've been looking for my fav. chili recipe and that means it needs to be hot. Habanero peppers are a must and so far this chili is the best. I really don't change anything from the listed recipe except that i'm unable to find anything called chili paste at my local grocery store....which is a big store. Also, just to give it the consistency i like, i leave out one cup of water. I have added extra habanero's but it's not necessary. Enjoy!

This chili retired my usual recipe at our annual chili challenge.  This chili has a nice balance of heat and flavor.  The only change I made was only three Anaheim Peppers.  The reason being they were massive and didn't look like ones on the net (I don't think they were Anaheims).  For those that like it even hotter,  I set aside 1/3 of the chili and added 1 Ghost Pepper (Bhutt Jolokia) to the batch. It went over very well. Probably the best chili I ever had, thank you for the recipe.

WHEW!!! Eyes watered, nose ran, face turned red, started to sweat, and a gallon of milk. Yeah baby...now THIS is chili. Do not change a thing, this is the perfect recipe. You can reduce the peppers if you don't want it as hot, it would still be amazing.

I know some people dislike when people tell about the variations they made; I personally find it very useful.

I kept all the basics, but I was lacking some items. I had no pork; I used a whole pound of bacon and I cubed 12 oz of beef tenderloin steak.

I added a dash of nutmeg, cardamom and tiny bit of cinnamon. Also 3 bay leaves.

I think lime and beer go together, so I added 1/4 of a lime.

The spices gave some sweetness, and lime just added a sassy taste.

Awesome dish!  It is "hot" but not as hot as I thought it would be. I had to make a few changes because I could not find the ingredient or did not have the ingredient on hand.  I used 1 large Poblano chili pepper in place of the Anaheim and I used hot sauce for the chile paste.  I used beef broth, 1 (28 oz) can of whole tomatoes and 1 (14.5 oz) can.  I used 3 cans of chili beans, used a 6 oz can of tomato paste and did not use any water.  The consistency was perfect. I also added 1 t. of brown sugar.  Will definitely make again.

We love spicy foods so we bumped this recipe up a bit.  Beans were reduced by half a can and we went with 8 of each pepper, keeping the seeds.  The result was about as hot as a real Thai dish.  (I wouldn't recommend this modification to anyone who isn't sure what a real Thai dish is, though, as it may remove a few layers from your soft palate.)    I would also recommend latex gloves when handling the habaneros.  I didn't do this and my left paw is now pink and hairless.  The chili is so good, however, that it was worth it.  5 stars and a "Yee Haw!"

This is without question, the best chili I have made. Anahiem peppers are not available at my stores, so I make up the difference by doubling the habaneros( I grow these in my garden) I tweaked the recipe the second time I made it, to fit my taste. There's no need to add water to this chili,unless you like it soupy. Easy to prep, and well worth the effort of seeding all those peppers.

Awesome chili!  It is my son's favorite ever.  Definitely wear gloves for the prep otherwise every tiny cut on your hands will be on fire.  I up the garlic 2-3x.  Using turkey bacon and turkey/beef for this batch due already being too fat for all the pork.  Hopefully it will be just as good as the original.  I also just cook a bag of dried kidney beans instead of the canned.  Simmer the rest of the ingredients together while the beans cook then combine.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Great chili! HOT HOT HOT!!! Make it as- is to win the hairy biker chili cookoff or tone it down by using 1 habanero,  2 jalapeno (1red, 1green),  and only 3/4 tablespoon red pepper to let the whole family enjoy. Still pretty spicy though.  I also substituted ground pork with double beef and 3/4 lb bacon-yummy.  Definitely stick with the anaheim peppers and chili paste (find it in asian section of supermarket)

This chili is awesome!!! I only made 2 slight changes--left out the bacon because I didn't have any, and reduced the amount of peppers by half, and the spice was perfect! Other than that made as written. It is the best chili I've ever made!!!

This recipe had excellent flavor, but I may have had poor habenero peppers.  It didn't have the heat that we were looking for.  I made it for a football party, and everybody loved it...it just needed a little more spice.  Next time I will use a few more habenero peppers.

There is no way you could ever pay me enough to try a recipe like this so I'm going to review it from my husband's perspective. He thinks it is AWESOME! I make it for him every couple of months, and I follow the recipe exactly. He sweats as he is eating it and enjoys every bite. Thanks for a great meal for the husband!

Delicious chili, and like another reviewer mentioned, warms your whole mouth, doesn't just burn your tongue.  I didn't have aneheims, but added seranos instead - I used the exact ingrediants, but didn't have bacon, which I think would have been great.  I'm going to try it again with the bacon.  I would definitely use the food processor the next time for the peppers and onion.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just made this, and it's great. Wish there was more spice though. I made a double batch, only seeded half of the habaneros, and even added some Dave's Insanity Sauce, but it wasn't enough for me. I substituted Sriracha for the chili paste, cuz I couldn't find it anywhere.

The bacon is truly a must-have ingredient. It really adds something unique to the dish.

Will definitely be making it again.

I had never made chili before.  This was an easy recipe to follow.  I think next time I make it I will not seed some of the peppers as I think it could be hotter for my taste.  Overall nice job.

Fantastic chili.  Although next time I would use diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and leave some of the seeds in the habanero chiles. Maybe 2 for starters.  Loved it and definatly will make again.

Great flavor...I followed the recipe and made it in the slow cooker. I did add some brown sugar at the end which I like to do with tomatoes to take away some of the acidity. It just seemed a little soupy so I might just reduce the amount of water next time. Served with some corn bread muffins. Delicious!

This was Awesome Chili! First let me say I love "HOT" food, I love a good burn!!! I read the other reviews and was sceptical about adding all the peppers, but did anyway. I personally did not find this chili to be hot, not even on the second day. But remember I am used to eating hot foods with Habanero Hot Sauce. So for my liking next time I will be adding some of the seeds from the peppers to create the desired level of Hot I am looking for. But besides, my personal preference, the taste of the chili was Excellent!!!! I did make some minor changes: I added 2 cans of Hot Chili Beans and 2 cans of Kidney Beans (both 16oz cans, both drained), I only added 1 cup of water, I added the full pound of bacon, and also added a pound of ground Italian Hot Sausage. This made the consistancy of the chili thick and meaty.... I sereved hot topped with shredded Mexican blend cheese and sourcream and side of tortilla chips for dipping.... Yummy!! Thank you! :)

I have made this recipe twice now and get rave reviews from our guests everytime.  Depending on who is going to be eating the chili, I adjust the amount of peppers to regulate the hottness.  This makes great chili leftovers as well!

This is an excellent chili, very spicy, but also very good. I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes spicy food.  I used this to enter into a chili cookoff at work. I wanted a very spicy chili and was going for the spiciest chili. It didn't win the spiciest, but did win the best overall!   Here are the changes I made:  I used 10 habaneros, substituted serrano peppers for the jalepenos, and used 10 of them also; I only seeded half of each of these types of peppers. I only used 4 anaheim peppers. I used no water, but I did not drain the beans. When I make this again, I will use 1 full pound of bacon.  I think there are a lot of options to make this more or less spicy, but I wouldn't change too much, it's a great recipe!

This chili has an amazing flavor!  I just finished preparing my second pot.  I followed the recipe exactly as written both times, because it's perfect.  It is a nice hot chili, but not as hot as you would think it would be because you remove the seeds and I also removed the veins.  It was completely unfair of the reviewer who gave this recipe a bad review because the fumes from the peppers affected him/her, I mean, come on.  That is why you take precautions when working with hot peppers, rubber gloves and tie a towel over your nose and mouth if you're worried about it.  But I digress, this is the best chili recipe I've ever made, and is the only one I will ever make again.  Thanks Edd for a real winner!

I made this based on the positive reviews.  As I am here in my kitchen, I can hardly breathe from all the fumes from the peppers.  And I LOVE spicy food; everyone in my family knows I do.  I couldn't believe a recipe could call for 20 peppers, 12 of which were incredibly hot, and still be edible, so I cut the jalapenos to 2, the habaneros to 2 (all with seeds out), and the Anaheims to 2 (few seeds in).  And this turned out nearly inedible.  I am hoping I can salvage it by adding something else, but what?  The only thing I can smell and/or taste is the spiciness from the peppers.   I should have stuck to my tried and true, Reno Red, from the Chili Madness cookbook.  This chili has more than one flavor dimension, and it's spicy but very, very good.

OMG! Heat? Check! Make sure you save some beer for cooling your taste buds (as well as the recipe). I like spicy stuff and this definitely kicked up the normal chili. Don't skimp on the peppers...if you don't like it hot, try another recipe. Heed the title!!!

Added a touch of brown sugar and substituted three of the habaneros with serranos to tone down a bit.  We thought it was good, but not the best we've ever tasted.  Took to a chili cook-off where it was up against 14 other chilis and over 100 people voted.  It got only one vote for "best."  We felt kinda the same way.  Not bad by any means and good for something different, but not our favorite.

Couldnt quite decide how I felt about this the first time I made it, so made it one more time, and have to say that I don't think I'm a huge fan.  This chili comes out very "soupy", and lacks the richness that you find in a real good recipe.  It comes out tasting a bit like meat soaked in pepper juice, and it's more acidic than spicy.    The crunch of all the vegetables is nice, and I think that with a few modification (cut down the water a bit, add a pinch of brown sugar and just a little bit of honey perhaps) it might be a real good recipe but unmodified as it stands I find it interesting but average.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I was excited try it for myself. The other "fans" were not exaggerating... This chili is incredibly delicious. Far and away the best I've ever tasted, perhaps the best soup-type dish I've ever tasted. Amazing depth of flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter except for the peppers. Heeding the advice of others, I reduced the peppers by 1/2. While my tailgating friends complained about the spicyness, all of them agreed the chili, although spicy, was not overwhelming or painful/torturous. 

The proportions of meat/beans/liquid can be altered, but I suggest trying "as is" before getting too creative. This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

Definitely a nice kick to it.  I was concerned at first when the beer flavour seem to overwhelm the dish, but as it sits all the flavours came together.  I also omitted the beans (don't like beans) and did not change any other part of the recipe, and it turned out great.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This chili is one of the best recipes that I have ever made.  I did have to back the peppers off just a bit and I also added chopped sirloin to the mix.  I like the spiciness (when backed down a bit) and the flavor is great.  I took this to a work pot luck and everyone loved it.

EXCELLENT! I only used 3 habanero, 3 seranno (in place of the anaheim, which I could not find) and 6 jalapeno. It was not too spicy. A little kick, but that was all. So, so tasty, I think it's the bacon that makes this dish... Next time, and there will be a next time!, I'll use the full amount of habaneros and try to find anaheim chilis.. Serve with yummy crusty french bread for a great dinner!

Yes, as the reviews mostly state, this is a very good recipe! Flavorful combination. However, if you're looking for something that will truly live up to the 'hellfire' the name promises, I suggest you either leave some seeds in the peppers or use more chili powder or both. I used serranos instead of the anaheims and that worked out well.

Love this recipe.  Tweaked it a little bit and left the pepper seeds in rather than remove them to add a little more heat.  Great mix of heat and flavor.

This chili was great! I couldn't find the Anaheim peppers but used the habanero and jalapenos. I have a problem with heart burn so i used 6 jalapenos and 4 habanero and it made the perfect amount of heat for me.

Excellent recipe.  Although, even though I love bacon, I don't see the need for it in this recipe.  I did add a bit of corn which was nice.  Carrots and/or celery would also work nicely in this recipe, so I may do that next time.  Also, I made this in a crock pot (browned the meat first) and therefore did not add the water.  I felt the consistency was perfect when done this way.

This Chili has amazing flavor.  I alternated it only slightly to use up the tomato products that I had in the pantry.  I used three cans diced tomatoes, one full 6 oz can tomato paste and two cans of tomato sauce instead of what the recipe had.  Before I mixed the fresh vegetables in with everything else, I cooked them over a medium heat for about five minutes in some of the fat left over from the meats.  For people like me who can't handle a lot of heat, this chili is extremely hot, but my boyfriend loves it.  I can't resist the wonderful flavors made by the mix of meat and peppers, so to cool it down for me I mix in a bit of corn and top it with sour cream.  It took first place in the company chili cookoff.  Thank you Edd for a great chili recipe.

This was excellent!  Being Norwegian I had to use only half the chilies, and it was still hot enough for us. I also added a bit of salt and sugar, but other than that I followed the recipe more carefully than I normally do, and it came out just right!

I added all the ingredients except for the chili paste. I also did not seed the chile's. Overall the flavor was excellent. The only issue I had with this was, it was too soupy. Does anyone have any ideas on reducing this...besides not adding the water? I still loved this recipe and will make it again with a few adjustments...the addition of a can of kidney beans and not adding the water.

Really good and really spicy.  I didn't use the ground pork because I don't eat pork, but I did substitute with a beef sausage and it was amazing.  Had to use a little less of the spicy seasonings because I had little ones eating it as well, but it was very flavorful!

I try my best to follow a recipe exactly the first time.  Unfortunately, I could not find habanero peppers in my small town so I settled for serrano.  And it  hurt this recipe, I know, because   habaneros and I are old friends. (I grow my own.)  I know I lost a lot of heat,  but the taste was excellent.  I would bet w/habaneros this would be hellfire, but with serranos it was just hell... with  the fire put out.  Still it would be  spicy enough for those who are not leather mouths.  And, again, the flavor is excellent.  Many thanks, Edd.  I will try this again when the peppers come in.

It was a little too spicy for my own comfort. I didn't even use all of the peppers in the recipe. Nor did I use the bacon. However, with a little bit of adjustments, I think this could be a good recipe.

Very very good tasting recipe, but I didn't give it 5 stars due to it seeming more like a "chili pepper soup", than regular chili. There are sooo many peppers that they are all you taste. Could use more meat and beans and less peppers to even it all out. I also wish the recipe writer would've put a warning in the recipe regarding handling the peppers as my hands were in great pain for 5 hrs from the habanero's. I didn't know to use gloves when handling them.

Couldn't find a couple of things in our northern south dakota town of 25,000. No fresh habenero's or chili paste. Used pickled habenero's and just omitted the chili paste. Other than that did exactly as recipe called for. We like spicy food, so very good, if you don't like spicy, don't bother, you will hate it. Thanks, great chili recipe!!

My family loved this! I looked at the other reviews and left out some of the peppers. I used 6 jalapenos, and 3 habeneros. No Annehiems. I also left out the chili paste since I couldn't find any and doubled the tomato paste. This makes ALOT of Chili! We ate it for dinner and hubby took it for lunch and I still froze some!

Awesome recipe, Followed it to the T with the exception of the Bacon, only because I didnt have any, added a little extra Cumin... because I love it ... Was afraid the peppers would be tooo hot, but not at all, was very flavorful & with the peppers being seeded, the heat was perfect ! Great recipe , was told not to lose this one !

I had no Anahiems available and modified the recipe only slightly by using fresh tomatoes rather than whole canned ones and leaving the seeds in all of the chiles. I was surprised that the recipe is not as hot as I thought it would be! Excellent blend of flavours! Rich and firey red colour as well.

This chili is great!!! I made a few changes: I used 3 habanero, 3 serreno, and 3 jalapeno pepper. I omitted the chili paste because all I could find was chili sauce and I omitted the red pepper flakes. Other than that I followed the direction. After modifying the peppers this chili was good with a little kick. My kids including my 19 month old loved it. I put the peppers, onion, green pepper, and garlic in the food processor to cut down on prep time so it was very easy to make. The only change I would make next time is that I would add the whole tomatoes to the food processor too.

This is a great recipe that is flexible enough for tweaking.  I won a very close 3rd place at a chile cook-off with a slight variation on this recipe.  The heat from the peppers comes on slowly and fills the whole mouth, instead of burning a part of your tongue until you're in tears.  I used diced pork instead of ground (a great contrast in texture).  Also, I couldn't find Anaheims, so I threw in a couple of serranos and a can of chipotles with the adobo sauce.  It was just a fantastic chile!

This is by far the best chili I have ever had. The balance between heat and flavor is unparalleled. Definitely recommend to any chili lover. Sour cream and cheese help reduce the heat for the faint of heart. Don't forget a glass of milk.

I made 3 batches at one time (15 quarts).  I changed the recipe from using ground beef and ground pork to using 1 1/2 lb.Tri Tip and 1 1/2 lb. Pork Loin, per batch.  I will definitely make it again.  
It was a big hit at our son's fire station.  I passed out 8  copies of the recipe.

Love this recipe! Have made it several times, though I typically cut the number of jalepenos and habeneros in half. Also I add a can of corn to moderate the heat.

This is our favorite chili recipe! We make it about once a month and freeze the leftovers.  There is so much flavor and we get about three meals out of it.  We think it tastes better after it has frozen and been reheated, all the flavors meld.  Initially I'd make it exactly as written, but now usually use four of each pepper only because the chopping takes a lot of time.  We haven't noticed much of a difference in taste.  If I don't have bacon I'll leave that out too.   Lots of heat though, so be prepared! Also, make sure to wear gloves, my hands burned for days after the first time I forgot gloves.

Chili has awesome taste. Was able to find the Anaheim chilis at whole foods. They have an abundant supply of them. Everyone loved the chili. The only complaint is that it is not as hot as advertised. Had a good heat to it but not super spicy. This was good for the guest who are not big fans on heat, but the people (like myself) who crave the heat, it was lacking. That was resolved though simply by adding my favorite hot sauce. Great recipe. Worth the work.

Hello...  I agree with Chef Mike. I cooked this chili yesterday for our semi annual chili 'cook off' and was awarded "best chili" out of about 12 entries...  Did not deviate from the recipe other than using the seeds from half of the Hab's and Jalop's and adding a can of tomato sauce because it seemed thicker than I prefer.  Simmered for about three hours. Thought it would be MUCH hotter than it actually turned out.

I never ate chili, but I thought I'd try something new. I chose this recipe because I love spicy and the reviews were pretty convincing. And I'm glad I chose it. What a great recipe to get me in to chili. I feel like I've been missing out all my life. This recipe has a nice heat to it. The spiciness wasn't overwhelming but as others said its relative. I like spicy and I rarely find things too hot. I made slight alterations to this recipe. I cooked it in a slow cooker overnight. I used pork sausage (jimmy dean hot) instead of regular ground pork. I added more garlic (about 6 cloves) and omitted the water (my slow cooker had no room for water by the time I added everything else). And I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. My husband loved the chili but asked if I could add more beans the next time. I think there were enough beans. Maybe next time I might add more bacon as it wasn't noticeable but other than that it was a great recipe. Living in California made finding the ingredients easy. I would recommend this recipe and will definitely be making it again!!!
Just an update, still my favorite chili. I just added a little Worstershire sauce (1.5 tsp) and that gave it a little extra flavor. And seriously if the recipe is too hot, add sugar or honey and it will mellow out the heat. Pre-sugar my husband was sweating. Post sugar he could handle the heat. I also think cooking it in the slow cooker reduces heat but melds the flavors more.

Awesome recipe! Entered this in a chili cook-off and placed second, missing first place by 1 vote. Our grocer had Anaheim peppers, however we could not find Chile paste, so we went without it. Also, based on the reviews here, I added 1/2 tablespoon salt and tasted it, preparing to add another 1/2 tablespoon, but it was perfect. Also note that 1 Wyler's bouillon cube = 1 teaspoon of granules, and there are 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon. Therefore this recipe calls for 6 bouillon cubes. One thing my wife and I will change when we make it again is add the full 1 lb of bacon instead of the half pound. The bacon was barely noticeable. Note that seeding 21 peppers is not a quick task...do that part first! Also, I used PBR for the beer.

We really liked this hot but tasty soup.  We don't eat ground round or ground pork, so I substituted ground turkey.  My grocery store was out of Habanero, so I just added more Anaheim peppers.  I also don't use bouillon granules, so I used soy sauce instead.  It is definitely worth the effort and will make again.

This is really good chili but whoooeeee it is hot!
I even put only 4 jalapeno/habanero chili's ... I couldnt' find anaheim chili's (don't know what kind they are - mild?) used new Mexico dried chili's (soaked and blended with some beef broth) - they're kinda fruity and mildly spicy.  I used an orange pepper vs. a green bell pepper (like the flavor better).  I also used beef broth vs. water and boullion.  MY DH likes beans so added 2 cans of drained/rinsed kidney beans in addition to the chili beans.   The next time I make this I will use the whole 6 OZ can of tomato paste vs just 3 OZ
Very good flavor - the "boys" really liked this chili.  Served it with toppings of cheddar, diced sweet onion and sour cream.

This chili was amazing according to my hubby and his buddies. I can't handle hot so I made just for them and I did this recipe exactly just at the end I added a couple drops of liquid smoke just for a slight smoke taste but this was only added AFTER a bowl was consumed according to the recipe ;)

unfortunately i didn't drain the whole peeled tomatoes.. so this took a few hours to reduce.. and just like chef mike i had to add a little something at the end.. it wasnt garlic salt.. but some montreal steak seasoning.. because even though we're not huge salt fans.. this def needed a punch of something that had salt in it.. it had a nice finish of heat.. but not overwhelming.. ty for the recipe

I just made a batch of this chili following the recipe as close as possible.  I must say it's very good chili.  Looking forward to the cook off at work tomorrow and the Super Bowl on Sunday.  Very nice.  Thanks to the person who posted the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic as is, but naturally I add lots and lots more heat because I am insane or something. It makes a LOT of food, gets better the next day, and is great for making chili mac.

My wife usually makes chili, however I impressed upon the fact that chili needs to stay true to its namesake! And this recipe does just that! It was amaaaaazing! Definitely not as spicy as I thought it would be, seeing it took me a solid hour and a half to chop all the chilies. But well worth it. WOW. This is the only chili my family will be eating going forward.

This is a great chili.  My boyfriend and I cooked it in a slow cooker instead which reduced the intensity of the habanero (to our dismay).  We cooked up the bacon, and then cooked the ground meat in some of the bacon grease. Then we threw in all the ingredients (including the juices) and then placed them all but adding the bacon in the last half hour of cooking.  We did halve the anaheim and ommitted the bell pepper.   For our personal taste, and from some of the pictures it seemed like too much green pepper for us.  We also kept the seeds to keep some of the kick but it still wasn't enough for us.  We prefer it more spicy and the slow cooker seems to reduce the spicyness so we may add more habanero to ours in order to maintain that spice.  Overall, the recipe is delicious and I will gladly make this over and over again.

Great flavor!!! Used Serrano's instead of Jalapeno's, beef broth instead of beer, chicken in place of beef cubes, and I added white pepper plus mexican oregano.Also, used sauce instead of diced and diced in place of whole. I know that sounds like a lot of changes but it was all because of personal taste nothing against the recipe. I always wanted to find a HOT recipe...now I have! Hot but not enough you can't enjoy it.

This was delicious.  It wasn't nearly as hot as I thought it was going to be.  I eat Indian food regularly, and this doesn't compare to Indian Vindaloo.  My apprehension had to grounds, this chili was incredible!  I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe as written except I didn't use the chili paste because I have no idea what that is?  I also couldn't find fresh habanero's so I had to use the ones that come in a jar.  I think that really hurt my results because, believe it or not, this recipe was just NOT hot enough.  I'm sure the fresh ones would have made it hotter.  The chili was still very tasty, but I've made other chili that was just as tasty and hot enough for me, with far fewer ingredients.

This is an excellent recipe if you like warm and spicy chili. The peppers blend nicely and I won first place at our small chili cook off with this recipe.  

The recipe lends itself to all types of interpretations and I did have to make some pepper substitutions since I could not find Anaheim peppers. I look forward to making it again as the original poster intended.

Big Hit!!! Though I didn't attempt the full amount of peppers. I Just used 6 jalapenos and 4 Anahiems. But It was just right for us! I will make this my staple chili.

I made this for a cook off (I'll let you know how that goes).  But I imagine a lot of people will submit chili so hot it'll make your throat bleed, so I toned this down to make a little more family friendly.  I love the way the flavors marry.  Nothing in particular stands out, its still got quite a bit of kick, but you can really enjoy eating it too.  I love the bacon, chili paste(never thought of that!) I also used Serrano peppers, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, beef stock instead of bouillon and omitted the water...Very good recipe!  wish me luck...

...I won 2nd place!  thanks for sharing your recipe!

Tonight is the second time I am making this. It is sooooo good. The first time I cut down on the peppers. I used 3 Habanero, 4 Jalapeno and 6 Anaheim. I also used less of the red pepper flakes. This time I am going all in. 6 Habaneros, 6 Jalapenos and 6 Anaheim. Can't wait for the results. Even that it was really good last time and spicy, I felt the next day it didn't have that much heat. It was still amazing, but not spicy, that's why I am trying it with all the peppers. Can't hardly wait. One more hour.

Made it by the numbers, i.m.h.o. it was a bit too hot for most people.  I added 16 oz. crushed tomatoes and 16 oz. of stewed tomatoes and that toned it down a bit.  Overall, fantastic recipe!

This was really good. We used half beef and half buffalo meat and it was wonderful! I did add an extra can of beans. Thanks for the recipe!

I added a touch of brown sugar and honey to make it a "sweet heat".  Had no luck finding habenero's in the chain grocery store so substituted more jalepenos.

Hellfire couldn't be more accurate! This is such a great tasting chili, but not recommended for the average chili fan. You REALLY need to be a fan of spice to eat this one. This was my first attempt at making chili, and I'm pleased with how easy this was. Don't let the large ingredient list throw you off, this is a very simple recipe. Hands down, this is a keeper!

I made this for the Super Bowl and it got rave reviews!  DO be sure to wear gloves when cutting the peppers though.  I didn't and my hands were burning the whole rest of the day.

I got great feedback on this Chili.  I added a tblsp more Cumin than what the recipe asked for, cut the habenaro amount to 4, and used less anaheim peppers used 2 instead.  Everyone loved it.  The chili had enough heat but everyone could taste all the ingredients.  I let my chili cook in the crockpot for a day or two and it was even better!

When I was reading about habanero peppers, one article said to wear gloves when you prepare them.  I thought it was a joke...THIS IS NO JOKE PEOPLE!  My hands hurt so bad my husband had to do the clean up after I made this chili.  Shucks!

Five stars for sure-- he loved it.  I couldn't find ground pork so I used beef and ground turkey.  I also used beef broth instead of the granules and water.  As for the beer...it was Bud Select from the neighbor.  I spose I'll have to share some chili with them too now...

My only gripe with this, besides the pain, is that it is a little "soupy" for my liking, so I'll probably add an extra can of beans next time, or a little less liquid.  All the seeding, chopping, etc is worth it for this chili!

Just an edit to add...this thickened better overnight in the fridge and was even better as leftovers.  THANKS!

Very good!  Just won a chili cookoff for HOTTEST chili with this recipe!  My suggestion is make sure that you wear gloves while seeding the peppers!  I had people sweating from all the flavors in the chili.  Much better second day!  I was not able to find chile paste, it was still great without it!  Thanks for the recipe!

For me this was alittle to spicy but it was really good. I went to a chili cook off and all the guys really liked it but most of the girls said it was to hot. I used about half of the peppers and couldnt find chili paste. So next time less peppers and this will be for dinner more often. Thanks.

This was good (not the best i've ever had) and very hot.  I only used 1/2 the peppers and it had good hot flavor.  I didn't know what chili paste was, so I left it out. I will make again.

I would say that this is a good solid chili recipe,  but labeling it "hellfire" is a bit of an overstatement.   I doubled the habenero and it wasnt even that spicy.  The flavors were good and I would make it again, but add more chilies.

5 Stars for flavor alone! Couldn't find Anaheims and not a fan of hot sauce, so added 1 1/2 tablespoons of cayenne to the other chili powders used. Added 2 cups more water.

I would give this 5 stars but it seems to be missing something that would make this a perfect 5 star chili and I am not quite sure what it is yet. I followed the recipe to the letter and unfortunately it was not hot, but that is not the recipes fault that is the stores fault for selling scotch bonnet peppers as habanero peppers. I believe if I had been sold the correct peppers it was have be amazing and the perfect heat. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe

I've been making this chili for a couple of years now. Won my annual chili-cookoff at work twice with it, the first time going by the recipe.  We also have a licensed gourmet cook as one of the main judges and he's rated it the best chili he's ever had!  

The Anaheim peppers where I get them tend to be pretty big so I go with four.  Those are the key to making this chili taste good.   I've gone to using 4 Anaheim, 1 green bell, 2 pablano, 5/6 jalapenos, 5/6 serranos and usually six habaneros. When doing the peppers, I usually dice everything pretty big and then mince the serranos and habaneros.  I do remove the seeds but not the membranes (initially I did, not anymore) and it does provide the extra kick.  I usually get two lbs of ground and cook in a lb of Jimmy Dean sausage after doing the bacon.  Then I add the onions/peppers and cook them up for a bit.  On the side I usually do the two cups of water and stick the two beef bullion cubes there, once done, I pour a bottle of beer (usually a bottle of Yuengling lager. I use the French's "Chili-O", two packets or you can buy it by the huge container for around $15 on Amazon and it will make at least a dozen batches.  I do the bacon and meat afterwards in an eight quart cast iron dutch oven.  Add the peppers/onions and garlic there and cook in the chili powder.  But since the dutch oven will not hold all the contents of everything else, I transfer it all into a stainless steel stock pot (12 quart) and then add the rest of the i

I have made this chili twice. The first time, I did not wear gloves when cutting all of the peppers. BIG MISTAKE. My hands burned for the next couple days and I couldn't touch my face/eyes without having them burn too. So, rule one, buy some thick latex cleaning gloves. I wore these the second time I made this chili and my hands were fine.

Both times, the chili was amazing! Other spicy chili recipes seem to focus on spice over flavor. Make no mistake, this chili packs a punch but it really has a great flavor. Personally, I like it better the day after I make it because the flavor seems to be even better. 

The first time I made this chili, I didn't add the chili paste. It is definitely much spicier if you add the chili paste but the flavor is the same so if this is just too spicy for you, omitting the chili paste is a good way to decrease the spice without losing the flavor. 

I definitely recommend this chili and will make it many more times in the years to come.

I love this but I slim down the heat, 1 habanero,  4 jalapenos,  2 Serrano peppers is all we can handle with the red pepper flakes and I use a hot chili paste

This chili is fantastic if you like spicy chili.  I really wanted to leave this review to give a major tip: Add a bag of roasted corn and you take this chili from 5 star to off the charts.  Also for the can of beer, look for some type of chocolate beer, I swear it makes a difference.  This is now my go-to, cook-off winning chili.

If you don't like it super spicy just wash the peppers out really good under cold water.  You'll get all the flavor of the peppers without all the spiciness.

So great! It has such a dynamic flavor profile. We even amped it up a bit by adding some ghost pepper powder and allowed it to develop flavor in the crockpot over night after following the recipe. Delicious!

Loved it! Everyone who has tasted it has loved it. I added some sliced white mushrooms to it. This chili is not overly spicy and has a great aftertaste. I made 2 batches, for the second batch I used 1 cup of water instead of 2. Just to get it a bit thicker

Great recipe. Everyone that tried it loved it.
Perhaps my habaneros were a bit less spicy than they could have but it didn't turn out quite as hot as I was hoping. I will try it again soon but this time for the final part I will cook it for a few hours in a crock pot so that it will absorb more heat and flavor from the peppers.

I love spicy chili, this was great. I used 3 lbs of ground beef instead of bacon and pork because I don't like them. I also only used 4 habanero peppers and did NOT de-seed them, as well as one Anaheim pepper since they're huge. Great recipe, would definitely make again.

I won a chili competition based on this recipe.  Although I added ghost peppers and various hot sauces, it was the addition of chipotle peppers that really added to the taste of it.

I made it. It was excellent, I would suggest it to many. But if you like the spice you should add more habenero peppers. It was the best chili I've ever had.

I've been using this chili recipe for a few years, and it is always a hit with those who try it. Don't let the name fool you into thinking that it is too hot to handle. The habaneros  add a wonderful, smoky flavor, but not too much heat.

Won 2nd place in a work chili contest using this recipe as a base. There were close to 15 chili's entered. It had great flavor, but was not too heated. Everyone who tried it had a great response. Here are my alterations.
1. 1 cup of ginger ale instead of beer.
2. Only used 1 can of whole tomatoes.
3. Added 1 tsp of salt.
4. Did not use chili paste. (lack of availability) 
5. 36 oz of sausage/beef mixture. (I'm too cheap for ground round)
6. Smoked the meat prior to adding to the chili. (Highly recommend this)

It was great! I substituted different peppers (because we read some reviews and wanted it spicy but not overwhelming) but still used the same amount and it turned out great! Salt to taste of course and don't forget to wear gloves! My fingers were on fire for 2 days. Great recipe

Absolutely amazing - our new go-to chili recipe. Here is how I adjusted: reduced the peppers by 2 jalapenos and 1 habanero (we have three young kids, otherwise it would've been fine),  did not add 2 cups water, used an IPA for the beer, used whole tomatoes in a jar imported from Italy (Jovial, Whole Foods) - did not rinse- used the sauce that came with them, did not add the 2 cups water. Our chili paste was Korean gochujang. Served with iron skillet cornbread. The kids and adults LOVED this.

Came back to this recipe after trying a few others and it's the best.  I skip the water and more than double up on the beer (used Fat Tire amber ale) & follow the recipe otherwise. I like some texture so I chop & dice the slow way - no food processor. It does get even better as the flavors blend so make it the day before if you want to really impress a crowd.

Tasted great and had the right amount of heat, but if I make it again I'll cut the water in half. I like thick chili and this was really watery.

If you like hot and spicy chili, this recipe is absolutely fantastic! I did make some substitutions though. I omitted the one can of crushed tomatoes and the two cans of whole tomatoes and substituted fresh puréed beefsteak tomatoes. I also substituted the two cans of chili beans for Pinto beans. I'm from New Mexico, so I did not use Anaheim chiles, instead I used fresh roasted "Hatch" green chile! Overall, this recipe deserves a five star rating!

Excellent chili, perhaps the best I've ever had! I made a few substitutions based on what was available at my grocery store. For the ground meat, I used 2.5 lbs of meatloaf mix - a blend of beef, pork, and veal. I could not find habaneros, anaheims, or chile paste, so I added extra jalapenos and a good helping of habanero-based hot sauce. It came out hot, but not overwhelmingly so. I also added a can of sweet whole kernel corn and 2 extra bell peppers - one red and one yellow. Extra garlic too. The extra meat and vegetables resulted in a nice thick consistency, especially after an additional hour of cooking. My batch did not come out soupy at all as some other reviewers mentioned.

Next time I will use a full pound of bacon, hopefully some habaneros and/or other hotter pepper varieties instead of  relying on hot sauce, an extra beer (and less water), and perhaps another variety of meat. I'll probably use diced instead of whole tomatoes too - the whole ones can be broken up after cooking, but I'd rather have smaller chunks to start with.

The only things I changed was instead of the listed amount of Anaheim peppers, I used 4 ... They were huge and I'm lazy so I'm not going to dice or slice THAT many peppers, especially while wearing gloves. Then, I didn't add water and I drained the whole tomatoes really well.
Otherwise, this is a great recipe. Definitely will make again.

This recipe is what I've been searching for! the only thing I didn't do was add the beans (personal preference). I also used beef stock instead of water. I started with 5 cups and reduced down to about 2 cups. Spicy and delicious.

This was the first time I made chili and it turned out great, the only thing I added was a teaspoon of garlic salt.  I will definitely make it again and again

This is great chili! I did use one less Jalapeño and one less Habinero and I added Cayenne Pepper very nice but not for the faint of heart for sure

Made exactly to recipe. Labor intensive, very disappointed.
I am a high intake hot ingredient eater, usually with every meal.

I thought it bland. My wife said,  "it needs salt".

It's awesome and my favorite chili!  I've made it at least a half dozen times and won and placed in chili cook-offs at work!  It's spicy, but not as spicy as you thing since the seeds are removed from the peppers.  At first I made it exactly as the recipe described,  but have come to leaving the bacon out as I don't think it adds any flavor.

I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It really made all the difference!  It had a sweet heat quality to it. Everyone asked for seconds.

This chili is phenomenal!  I doubled the meat, and omitted the bacon only because I forgot to buy the bacon, and I had some extra meat I needed to use.  The only other change I made was leaving in the seeds to the peppers because I'm a glutton for punishment.  I will definitely be making this again.  If you don't like spicy, find another recipe!

I made this chili for my company chili cook off and won!!! There were 11 dishes to compete with. I really liked it and there sure wasn't any left afterwards. I swapped 3 poblano peppers for the Anaheim and red kidney beans for the chili beans. Turned out well given that it cooked overnight.

Best chili recipe I've ever made/had!  Yes it says "hellfire" but the amount of heat you choose to put in can vary. Some days I want it hot, other days I might not. Either way it's amazingly flavorful. I skip the water because I like thicker chili. Aside from that, I've changed very little. On the days I want less heat I just add fewer habaneros and jalapeños. Anaheim peppers are not always available at my store so I don't always use them. When it comes to the meat, I just use 2 pounds of hot Italian sausage, soooo yummy!

If this chili tastes half as good as it smells then I have a keeper here!  Can't wait to try this, only changes I made were serrano's for the jalepeno's and beef broth instead of water.  Oh, and I used ground turkey because the grocery store had a few pounds on clearance and I could not pass up the price!  Can't wait for the family to get home so we can dig in.  Sour cream, cheese, and scallions for topping and corn bread muffins on the side.

I just made this chili and followed the recipe exactly.  This is probably the best chili I have ever eaten!  We love spicy foods and so the name of the chili really tempted me!  It is obviously very spicy but the flavors are just incredible!  I believe this will be my official tailgating chili this coming football season!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, this will be enjoyed over and over again by us!!

I've made this chili 3 times now. That's how much I love this recipe!! This last time I only made 2 changes that I think still think are true to the recipe. ( I don't like reviews where the entire recipe is changed so much that it's not what was originally posted!) 

Some of my guests wanted a soupier chili, so this last time I did not drain any of the cans. I think that also added flavor in addition to liquid. I also added (because it was on hand and needed to be used) a pound of chorizo sausage. The end result was awesome! This is the only chili I will be making from now on!

Excellent base chili recipe. Didn't have the anaheims so just threw in a can of green chiles. Everything else basically the same plus a bay leaf. Wasn't as hot as I expected with that many habaneros but flavor was excellent.

Thought this was a great recipe.  I followed the ingredient list and was scared after I tasted the aneheim peppers because they were hot. Think peppers in the summer time rippen better and have more spice. Therefore, only added two habies when I should of put in four. This chili recipe was medium hot with 2 habies. This chili is going to New Mexico with us into the mountains.  Thanks for a great chili recipe. :)

Im a lover of spicy/hot foods so I wanted to try this recipe. I pretty much halved the recipe as I only cook for me (big portion eater) and hubby (not a big portion eater). Hubby hasnt tasted it just yet but I think its average. I used 4 habs, 1 ana, and 3 jals....and kept a few of those hab seeds for some extra "fire". Beware: IT IS HOT!!!! I think the cumin was somewhat overpowering...I also added a pinch of light brown sugar and honey to give a "sweet hot" as someone else recommended. I also used tomatoe sauce and crushed tomatoes with basil....and a shot of habenero tabasco sauce since I didnt have chili paste around. I probably won't make it again, but I will be freezing this current back for later in the week....a good "go to" lunch.

Excellent! I love this chili and it is the only chili i will make now. I did leave all the seeds in the hot peppers, added some more chili powder for more flavor and left out one of the cups of water as it was a good consistency with only one. i think next time i make it i will add an extra habanero or two, i like to barely be able to eat my food because it is so spicy and one or two more habaneros would do the trick. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good! Wonderful recipe as is, but I have to admit that I added a few things for personal taste.  First, I used ground venison instead of beef or pork because we have tons of it in the freezer.  (Didnt use the bacon) I also added fresh diced tomatoes, extra peppers and garlic, and a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. (chopped the peppers and poured in some of the sauce)  Amazing! Thank you, thank you!  This will be my chili recipe from now on.  Topped with sour cream and served with cornbread.  Yum!

Great recipe - great flavor even after cutting back by half on the peppers.  I think they could be cut back even again and it would still have a nice heat.

I love this recipe! I have made it about 20 times in the last 3 years.  I have altered it a bit though. As me and most of the people who come over to eat it dont care for chunks of tomato.  So I just put in 30 ounces of tomato sauce and no chunks of tomatoes or whole tomatoes.  I also put in about a whole pound of bacon to go with the pound of pork and beef.  I dont add habanero since i already get complaints about it being to hot with just jalapeno. I just dont take out much of the seeds in my jalapenos so it still has kick to it. Anyone who is thinking about making this for the super bowl or any other occaison I recommend it and will be making it Super Bowl Sunday!

THIS WAS GREAT. I ELIMINATED ALL THE PEPPERS EXCEPT THE JALAPENOS AND USED A 16.5 OZ BOTTLE OF DOC JACKS HABANERO GRILLIN SOSS. THIS CHILI ALSO GOES GREAT WITH ANDY'S FIVE PEPPER WINGS ALSO LOADED WITH PEPPERS AND LOTS OF HEAT. GREAT COMBO FOR ANY SUPERBOWL PARTY!

If you like spicy chili this is the recipe for you.  With the amount of peppers in the recipe its not as hot as you'd think.

I just won the chili cook off at work with this recipe - I cut the habs down to 2, japs down to 3, Anaheims down to 6 and used beef broth instead of bouillon and no water-My house smelled so wonderful and i had so much fun making this - Wear gloves when handling the peppers please! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

This chili has a great flavor, but it wasn't hot like I thought it'd be. Now granted, I used serrano peppers instead of habanero since that's what I had but it's not that spicy. I'm glad I tried it before entering a chili cookoff. I had about 8 cups of diced peppers! Maybe I should have kept the seeds in instead of seeding them like suggested. It didn't even get hotter after rewarming another day. I had to add Mountain Man to give it more spice.

I've been trying several chili recipes, and so far this one is my favorite.  It's not too hot (at least not to hubby and me), and the flavor is great.  Had a hard time finding the chili paste, but finally found some at Kroger on the aisle with the condiments.  It was on the top shelf near the chili sauces.  Found gloves (to use when chopping the peppers) at Wal-Mart in the Health/Medicine section.  Thanks!

This is definitely one of the best Chili's I have ever tasted.  I highly recommend it.  It's not as hot as the ingredients would suggest/  De-seeding the peppers really only gives this dish flavor and not much heat.  I like spiciness and suggest keeping the seeds for at least a couple.  You won't regret making this!

Great flavor!  First time through I cut the peppers in half per some reviews.  It was tangy, with a unique tang to it, but I could definitely have gone for more heat.  I must admit I added a julienned carrot and a stalk of minced celery.  I'd advise not being to fearful of the heat - it's a great recipe.

This chili is absolutely delicious!!  It's very hot so make sure to have some sour cream to top it with.  Leftovers are great for chili cheese fries...try using horseradish cheddar.

Awesome! I cut down on the Anaheim peppers(by half) and limited the Habanero peppers to four. I also added canned sweet corn to each individual serving.
