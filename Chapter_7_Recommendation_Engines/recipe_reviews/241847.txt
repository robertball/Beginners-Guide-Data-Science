I added some Hamburg and did not use a blender.  I took the harder ends of the asparagus and had that boil in the broth for about 10 minutes to add the asparagus flavor. Skimmed it out then added the rest of the asparagus and carrots to cook and when it was done I served with shredded cheese. It was delicious with and without the cheese.

Delicious recipe! Loaded with bright flavor. It was a big hit w/residents at the retirement home I work for. Many asked for second helpings.

This is an easy to make aspargus soup with a mild flavor.  I used beef broth as the base and evaporated milk only  because I didn't have any regular milk in the house.  It turned out very nice.

Easy and healthy!  Thinking a potato or two might thicken it up a bit.
