I am 46 y/o and have never ate Spam.  This dish was very tasty and different, out of the ordinary.  So what I can say is, for something different this is a very good meal.  Not excellent, but very good

we were very diappointed with this - we like Spam and thought we were going to have macaroni & cheese and Spam casserole but this tasted like noodles covered in ketchup.

My boys loved this as kids.  Now, at 37 and 38, whenever I visit them, they always ask for this dish.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and I fried the spam in little pieces first.  I didn't use the cheddar cheese or onion or peppers but may try this one in the future.  We LOVE this dish.  Am making it tonight for my 38 year son at his request.

Loved this! Made it with tri-color bow ties and used a hot banana pepper from the garden instead of the green chilis. My 8 year old daughter ate it right down. Thanks for this easy and delicious dinner!

I had to mix and match but it came out better than expected.  All my kids(3) loved it and I chose to make this cuz I was in a pinch.  I used Mozz instead of cheddar, cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and had only MAYBE half a cup of ketchup left. quick and easy for this single pop of three.  SPAM is adored and respected in our house.  Ppl like us(from Islands) usually have a place in our heart for the canned meats.  Imported beef and pork is high.

I followed this recipe to the T and I have to say it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten in my life.  I guess everyone to his own tastes and this is NOT mine.

This was an okay recipe.  It was a good way to use a can of SPAM I found when cleaning out my pantry.  The ketchup and greeen chiles are definitely the dominant flavors.  If I were to make it again I would put more onion and less green chiles but everything else I would leave the same.

Made this today. I deleted the ketchup. Used broccoli and instead of cheddar cheese I used pepper jack cheese. Delish!

I really liked this one a lot. I mostly followed the recipe. Instead of rotini I used egg noodles (I was out of pasta). I used black pepper Spam which I figure didn't change the end flavor much. I used the hot green chiles which I liked because I love spice but my wife picked out. The only other thing is that right after I put the egg noodles in I added the ketchup/cream of mushroom mixture to the Spam and onion mixture so that it would heat upa bit before putting it in the oven. Oh, and the last thing I did was to use Colby Jack cheese instead of cheddar as I was out of cheddar. Not a ton of change but enough to recognize. It was super yummy and added to my list of favorites!

I forgot to mention that my roomy that is a organic freak had 3 servings and mention that she really liked the green chili kick.  It will be a keeper for me!

My husband loves this casserole!  I substituted tomato/basil spaghetti sauce for the ketchup (as I am not a ketchup fan), used jalapenos instead of green chili peppers (no chili peppers were on hand), sauteed the spam & onion together before mixing into the casserole, and added a touch of Frank's hot sauce for an extra kick.  This recipe has entered the regular rotation of recipes in my kitchen.

I had less than an hour to prepare and eat dinner one night, and no meat thawed out. This saved me! It's quick. It sounded really different and I wasn't sure if it would taste okay, but gave it a shot. Fiance has never had spam before and liked this dish. I will be making again if I'm ever on a time crunch. Didn't have onions this time so I just seasoned the Spam with onion powder while cooking it.
