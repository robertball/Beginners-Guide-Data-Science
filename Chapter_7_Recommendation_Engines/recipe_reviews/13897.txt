A nice alternative way to eat lentils.  Heed this warning though: if you cook the lentils as long as this recipe suggests, you will have soup.  It only took 30 minutes for my sauce to thicken enough to be served over pasta.

This was fantastic! I'm giving it 5 stars even though I made a couple of changes to suit my tastes.  First, I used vegetable stock instead of water, and at first I thought that was a mistake because it started to smell "vegetable soupish", but in the end it worked.  I think water would have worked fine too.  I used crushed tomatoes in puree instead of sauce, and like others added the zucchini with the tomatoes as I didn't want it overcooked.  I omitted the sugar and added a grated carrot with the tomatoes - it does the same thing that sugar is meant to do, cut the acidity of the tomatoes, but you also get a bit more nutrition.  And I seasoned with oregano, basil, salt & pepper.  Start to finish, my sauce was done in just under an hour - lentils were tender at about 35 minutes and the sauce simmered for maybe another 20 or so.  It was very filling and delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

Added fresh oregano and basil and black pepper to season; could have done with more, though.  Smelt great cooking!  Will freeze the rest and probably eat as soup instead of pasta sauce.  I used large, chunky mushrooms and they held their shape and texture well.  The recipe didn't say what kind of lentils to use; I used green, which worked well.  They cooked thoroughly but didn't disintegrate.  Will make again.
*** Update: increased to four stars because it's so yummy as a thick soup with wholemeal bread!  Fantastic take-to-work microwave food.

I suggest adding the mushrooms and zucchini 10 minutes before serving, so they do not become mushy and hold their shape

This sauce was a little too sweet for me--maybe if I eliminated the sugar it would be good because I love all the other ingredients.

thick and tastes good, but a little sweet for my taste.  I would make it the same without the sugar.

I left out the sugar and the last bit of water intentionally, and the garlic less intentionally and it was great. My toddler LOVED this so hence the 5 star stamp of approval. She is going through a fussy stage and usually doesn't really want to touch much of her dinner at night. She actually gobbled it all up!
I suspect that this recipe could be quite easily converted to a crockpot recipe. If you cook it in a wok with gas it only takes about 30 minutes too.

This sauce is a great, healthy concept, but the recipe, as written, is quite bland.  I made the recipe exactly as directed but my husband and I both thought it needed seasoning to help the flavor.  We ended up adding salt, black pepper, dried basil, thyme flakes, and garlic powder which improved the sauce significantly.  Next time I'll add these right away so that the flavors can develop while simmering.

I loved this and so did my boyfriend!
I added a large, chopped carrot to the mix of veggies. I also subsituted a half cup of light, red wine when I added the three cups of water. I wasn't sure how long to simmer the lentils before adding the sauce (ended up being about an hour) but it ended up perfect. Next time I will try some spices like pepper, oregano, and other Italian seasonings.

Wow!  I was really impressed with the heartiness.  Everyone who ate it loved it.  I added a few chicken bouillon cubes, but it really didn't need it. The next time I make it, which will be soon, I am going to follow previous reviews and use italian seasoning and add the mushrooms and zucchini later.

I'm on the fence about this one.  I added a lot more seasoning, and it was still kind of tasteless.  Wanted this to be good so bad.  Always looking to eat more lentils.  Even used chicken broth instead of water.  May give it one more try.

A bit bland so I added some ClubHouse  Roasted Garlic and Pepper Seasoning and CH Vegetable seasoning.  Didn't take as long to cook as the recipe called for but we were using red lentils which I think cook a bit faster.  Added some shrimp too which was a nice addition and we ate as a stew rather than as a pasta sauce.  After all these modifications it was delicious.

I followed the recipe as written but added about 1/2 pound Italian sweet turkey sausage (cooked) and also added a can of mild Rotel (omitting the water) when adding the tomato sauce and paste.  Also added 1/2 of a red bell pepper (chopped) to the veggies (mushrooms, garlic and zucchini).  Took it from 4 1/2 stars to 5!!!  Loved it as has everyone I've served it to!!

Excellent.  MUST add Italian Spices, even more basil and lots of salt/pepper.  I also used canned tomatoes along with fresh tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and substituted zucchini with bell peppers.

Oh boy was this good. Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars for me. Extremely healthy, full of veggies and lentils andd smelled wonderful. I served mine over whole wheat pasta. The changes I made were to: leave out the sugar, added more mushrooms, more zucchini,left out the additional half cup of water and I added the sauteed veggies towards the end as 45 minutes would have turned them to mush. Only change I plan on making next time is adding a bit of bite to the sauce.. shot of tabasco, a bit of cayenne pepper..  etc.

It's a good recipe just to add nutrition (lentils and vegetables) to sauce for pasta, but nothing amazing. Good for what it does though...I used whole wheat pasta. This recipe might need something to 'kick it up a notch' but I'm not sure what it is though.

Great recipe.  I also added celery, carrots and herbs.  My kids dont like lumpy sauces so I put all the veggies in my blender with some of the water then returned to pan with lentils and tomatoes to finish cooking - they loved it!!!
My baby even had some of it as a soup.

Wish I had read the comments before making this recipe. It needs some seasonning (oregano, basilic, thym) because mine came out bland. Next time I will also add vegetable stock powder after the lentils are cooked (in case the salt prevents the lentils to soften). Celery and carrots would add flavor as well. And also like other have mentionned, lentils are cooked in less time than what is mentionned in the recipe.

Really good!!  I made this with red and yellow peppers, since I had no mushrooms on hand.  I seasoned with dried thyme, oregano, basil, sugar and black pepper.  My husband and I had this over pasta for dinner and loved it.  Plenty of leftovers for a great lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was very tasty!! I added matchstick carrots, used only 1 tsp sugar, and also added a can of italian seasoned diced tomatoes (drained). I am thinking of adding fresh spinach and red and yellow bell peppers next time. was delicious! thank you!!

Although healthy, this is lacking flavor. I like the idea of the veggies and lentils but definitely needs additional seasoning.

Only 3 stars because there is not a lot of flavor in this dish. I like the veggies and lentils. I did like some of the other reviewers and added a bunch of seasonings like salt, pepper, oregano, basil, fresh thyme. I also used all fresh ingredients but it was just really bland and really tomatoee. I ended up adding about 2oz of Italian sausage to add some flavor. When I chopped the mushrooms and zucchini I left them a pretty good size but the mushrooms kinda disintegrated. So like the other people stated you should add those towards the end. I probably would not make this again.

We enjoyed this sauce very much.  I did as some other reviewers suggested and added Italian spices (1/4 tsp. each of basil, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme) plus 1/2 Tbsp. of dried parsley towards the end of the vegetable saute time.  I cooked the lentils just til tender and then added the tomato sauce and further cooked for about 20 minutes as the recipe stated - maybe longer.  I didn't add the last 1/2 cup of water because I didn't feel it was needed.  That may have been because I didn't have tomato sauce, but used canned tomatoes that I had pureed in a food processor.  I also added 2 tsp. of salt - much needed - along with the tomato sauces.  In any case, the sauce turned out delightful.  I served it with penne pasta along with a green salad.  The fact that the zucchini and mushrooms were very well cooked by the end of the cooking time actually, in my opinion, made the sauce more palatable for potential finicky eaters.  Thus, while some found the initial cooking time to be too long because the vegetables turned to mush, this was not a problem for me.  I thought it made the recipe better.  I wouldn't have wanted to crunch, even al dente, the zucchini and mushrooms.  Just personal preference.  This is definitely a keeper for us; we like lentils and look for new ways to prepare them.

This a nice vegetarian pasta sauce. I read all the reviews complaining that it was bland so I knew I needed to taste it and adjust it as I went along. Here is what I ended up doing. To avoid turning the zucchini and mushrooms into a mush, I started out with only the onions and garlic. While cooking the lentils I added some chicken stock and SALT, people, salt. I used only the tomato sauce, not the paste, and added heaps of basil and parsley and a bit of oregano and black pepper and more salt to it along with the sugar. Once I was happy with the flavour, I chucked in the veggies and cooked it another 15 minutes longer. It came out creamy and tasty. I am planning to eat some of it over cheese tortellini and some of it as a soup. I am hoping it will get even better after a few days in the fridge.

I only boiled the lentils for 30 minutes before adding the tomato sauce and I added in some Italian seasoning. This was enjoyed by vegetarians and meateaters alike. It does make a lot there were 7 of us and I could have probably fed aother 2 with what was leftover. Many Thanks.

Where is the flavor?  Tastes like plain old tomato sauce to me.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to experiment, so I dumped it.  It sounds really good, but it was really bland and really thick.  Maybe it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Yum!  Filling and almost decadent, this sauce is a real treat, but still very healthy! What more can you ask for?  My husband and I both loved it's wonderful flavor and texture.  A very good way to use bits of veggies you might have left over from the previous week's recipes.  The only thing I wonder is how well it freezes, since it makes so much good sauce!

I am impressed with the quality of this sauce.  It is thick and hearty.  I added hot sauce and Italian seasoning for added zest.  It can be eaten as a topping on pasta, rice or tastes delicious by itself with crusty bread.

This was super bland! There are no seasonings at all.  after I added the tomato sauce and realize how tasteless it was, I ended up adding about 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning, 1 tsp of rosemary, salt, black pepper, and some crushed red pepper.

Also, when adding the tomato sauce & paste, I did not add more water.  It was still pretty watery and I figured I'd just wait and see.  Never needed to add more.

I also agree with the reviewers that carrots would be a good addition.

I followed Christine M's directions and it was pretty good but I felt like it was missing something that I couldn't put my finger on. I served my husband's with Parmesan (I can't eat cheese) and he loved the sauce so maybe that was it. I used red lentils and cooked them for only 25 minutes because they were starting to stick to the bottom of the pan.

The only part of this recipe I'm rating is the idea of adding the lentils.  We always use jarred sauce and just add meat, fresh veggies & seasonings.  We made spaghetti today & only had a small amount of ground beef.  I remembered this recipe so we boiled up some lentils until they were tender & threw them in the sauce.  If you have picky eaters, I would puree the lentils before adding them because you can definitely see them & taste them when you bite into them!  I wouldn't say they taste like meat -they had more of a starchy texture, but I thought they were a great addition!  Great way of adding some nutritional filler to sauce!

I just got done making this sauce, and it is REALLY good. I didn't use the zucchini because I didn't have one, but used extra mushrooms instead. I also used a can of chopped tomatoes in place of the 1/2 cup water and second can of tomatoe sauce...more texture and flavor. OH, and also substituted one cup of the water for one cup of vegetable stock.  This really does have a "meaty" flavor with out the meat. I will definitely make again!

Yum!  I love lentil anything (so meaty and filling) and have been making lentil pasta sauce for years.  We used to prepare it regularly in the collective kitchen we organized.  I like the addition of mushrooms and zucchini - great addition.

This is delicious! I'm enjoying a bowl right now. It really has a meaty taste, wonderful! I was worried at first, because there's barely spices and i'm used to using a lot, but it came out great. I had to wing it with the tomato sauce and paste, in this country they don't sell sauce, and the cans are measured differently. But i'll be sure to make this again, and again, and again!

What a great idea!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and it turned out great.
1. Boiled lentils with veggie broth
2. Put sauteed veggies (including carrots) in for last 15 minutes with lentils
3. Used 1 can crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste
4. Omitted sugar and 1/2 cup of water at the end
We will be making this again!

This was pretty good, but I ended up making it into a soup later by adding vegetable broth made with beets, and that was really good!

This was OK but nothing overly exciting.  Just tasted too much tomato-y and needed some kind of umph.  But it was a different way to use up some lentils.

Very tasty with great texture.  My meat-loving husband had second helpings.  My 6 year old daughter who normally only eats pasta with butter also tried this dish and enjoyed it.  I'd make it again.

I first found this recipe three years ago, but I was a bit hesitant to try it as my boyfriend is a bit picky when it comes to vegetables.  Well, he went crazy over it!  He couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was!  We've both decided that it's one of our favourite dishes ever.  I'm kicking myself for having gone so long without it.  I wish I could give it ten stars!

Agreed with the notes that adding additional spices was the way to go. Are used to basil oregano sage but no salt or pepper and it was quite good still :-)

Delicious! 4 stars because I felt the flavor was a little lacking. I ended up adding a dash of oregano and then a couple shakes of Italian seasoning. I paired this with a serving of whole wheat rotini pasta. I will definitely be making this again!

With some adjustments this is easily one of the best meatless meals I've made. I sauteed the veggies together (added mushroms and a bell pepper) with 3 cloves of garlic. Seasoned additionally with oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, marjoram and fennel seed. Added in the tomato sauce and 1 cup of red wine and a tbsp brown sugar. Then I added the lentils and 2 cups water straight in the pot and cooked the whole thing for the recommended times.  Came out nice and thick (like a meatsauce!) and I mixed it with small shells casserole style. Healthy, hearty, delicious!!!

What a great dish! We really enjoyed this recipe last night.  My hubs was very surprised that there was no meat in the sauce. I added a spoonful of mushroom Better Than Bouillon and the wine that another reviewer mentioned.  Also used an 8 oz can to tomato sauce and a 10 oz can of puree b/c that is what I had on hand.  Very good and definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I made recipe for 4 servings. I was concerned about acidity but did not want to use sugar, so caramelized 1/2 yellow onion. Also chopped a carrot and added this when I sautéed the mushrooms, zucchini and garlic. Then, added the caramelized onions. Used red lentils, and 35 minutes was good for cooking. I had about 1/2 c left-over Rao's tomato sauce and used that with 4 oz of tomato sauce. Used the 6 oz can tomato paste... and also 1/2 c cheap red wine instead of the water. Also-based on other reviewers- added Italian seasoning, dried basil leaves, and Kosher salt. I used orecchiette pasta. Sauce was thick, and sweet!!! Would definitely make again! Have enough left over for another supper!!!

This recipe is so delicious and I make it often! Sometimes I don't add the zucchini or mushrooms and it still turns out great. I prefer it when I do it on the pressure cooker and it really speeds up the recipe. I do the lentil part for about 8-10 minutes in the instant pot, then add the tomato sauce after it's done and let it warm and thicken for 5-10 minutes. I skip the 1/2 cup of water at the end usually too. Works great!

This is a very good base, but definitely needs some spices. It's very filling - thick and hearty. I will make it again, with some modifications. And I will be more careful not to burn the lentils to the bottom of the pan in the last step..

The recipe as it is doesn't have nearly enough flavor. I added oregano, salt and pepper and still felt it was a little flat. If I make it again, I'll do as others suggested, substituting red wine for 1/2 cup of the water, add more zuchinni, more seasoning, etc. I served it over whole weat linguini, but if I did it again I'd use a heavier pasta - maybe orecchietti. Very filling, though and a healthy recipe.

This was really yummy - even my kids liked it (I took out the Zuch. for them).  I didn't follow cooking directions as I put it in the slow cooker and it really made it easy and turned out great.  I sauted the veggies (except the zuchini) put them and the remaining ingrediants all in together and cooked on low for a few hours.  I put in the zuchini the last five minutes of cooking so it would be crunchy.  It was thick and perfect as a pasta sauce - not "soupy" at all as others mentioned.  Will make again!

Wonderful!! I served this over spagetti!! MMMMMM... this is very filling and a great alternative to meat. The changes I made were: yellow bell pepper (needed to be eaten), 1/3 of a chicken bouillon cube, two pinches of dry basil, and scaled it down to 2 people. Wow, so good I think I might go back to my vegetarian ways!! :)

I like the concept of this recipe, but I think the sauce itself is bland.  I added basil and oregano, but it still tasted bland to me.  I think using crushed tomatoes instead of the canned sauce would be better.  I also agree with everyone about adding the zucchini later in the cooking stage.  I added a handful or two of parmesan cheese and that helped the flavor a bit. Some crushed red pepper would be good, too. 
All in all a good base to start with, but it definitely needs a little spicing up.

This was okay.  I used canned Italian tomatoes because they're sweeter.  My lentils completely disolved into the sauce, but it was quite good.  My boyfriend couldn't tell that there were lentils in it and he loved the dish.  Definitely top it with some good feta.  Feta makes up for the lack of taste in the sauce.

Ok. so I didn't follow the recipe at all but 5 stars for a very unique way to empty the fridge! I used leftover lentils, a diced sweet potato (small) instead of the sugar, celery, and brussel sprouts. The lentils thickened the sauce nicely and I served it over spinach tortelini! So Awesome!!!

Unique! Delicious! Even Addictive!

I love this sauce, and I'll use it again. It worked very well with some whole grain spaghetti noodles. Are you thinking "Lentils? In sauce? That's crazy!" Believe it! It's a wonderful sauce, and if you have the courage to buy lentils I recommend that you try it out!

I used this in my first "heavy" meal while coming off of The Master Cleanse.

This was a good recipe but as other people have stated it does need some extra seasoning.  While the veggies and lentils were cooking I added salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings.  This gave the dish a nice flavor.  I also think that next time I would leave out the tomato paste and add an extra tomato sauce instead just because the paste is so intense in this dish.  We used Orecchiette or ear shaped pasta since the lentils fit perfectly inside the pasta dents.  We will make this again.

I had to improvise the recipe, as I printed it our but left it at work.  I boiled the lentils in some vegetable broth with garlic and italian seasonings.  When they were about halfway done, I added some chopped onion and one jar of prepared tomato sauce. Served on top of cooked spaghetti, even my lentil-shy boyfriend loved it.

Love it! Will make again. I omitted the oil, added only 2 cups water and added a can of cut tomatoes (drained) for more texture. I severed it over Spaghetti Squash, a good pasta alternative.
