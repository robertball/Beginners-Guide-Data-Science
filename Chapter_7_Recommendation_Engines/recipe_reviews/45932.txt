My husband and I absolutly love it, we'll be having this one often. I cooked his a little longer, he won't eat anything rare. My husband calls this Chicken Fried Tuna.....he's from the south.

This recipe calls for way too much flour (and that's after I cut back to 3/4 cup), leaving the coating far less 'sesame' than I had hoped it would be.  Trying to add more sesame seeds after dredging it in the flour mixture was impossible because they wouldn't stick to the fish.  The glaze was really salty - my boyfriend loved it, but I thought it was pretty average.  
Tip:  Make sure you use a firm tuna!

This was sooo good I'll definetely make it again- and recommend it! I think next time I'd add even more water to the miso soup mix because I thought it would be good drizzled over asparagus too. I also served it with sticky rice. Fabulous!

Absolutely delicious -- I did feel that the recipe had way too much powder mixture to coat the fish and half the amount would have done the trick.  But a keeper recipe, at any rate.

I personally love this recipe, but my girlfriend thinks it's a little too salty. She prefers the "sesame seared tuna," also on this website, also excellent. But if you don't mind a little (lot) of miso, I highly recommend this one.

Way too salty! I eliminated most of the salt and it was still too salty.

I only made the miso sauce and flash seared the tuna in olive oil (leaving the middle raw).  As a few have pointed out the miso topping is too salty with just soy sauce and not the correct consistancy with one tablespoon of liquid.  Yes, will have to add water until the consistancy is gravy-like.  I added pineapple teriyaki and sweetened lemon jucie to the topping.  I think Ponzu (instead of soy sauce) + teriyaki could get a similar effect.  The miso adds a nice flavor, but recipe needs to be fixed to add water to topping.

can cut whole coating recipe in half for 2 or even 4 pieces of fish also bring the flour ratio down even more. The tuna was good mildly seasoned. The sauce was horrible! I dumped it out and mixed 1 T. mayo with 1/4 cup gyoza sauce and 1 t. mirin. Hot oil served on the side. Hubby loved it with the hot oil and kids liked it plain.

I have made this several times with fresh Ahi tuna - always delicious. I use enough water to make it syrupy and it turns out great.

5 stars all the way! I loved this dish; the flavor on the tuna was amazing! I made this pretty much "as is" except since I didn't have any powdered wasabi I smothered the tuna steaks in wasabi paste for a bit before Step 2. It still came out with a nice wasabi taste! I also made the sauce, however I made a second sauce that consisted of the wasabi paste, greek yogurt, and fresh ground horseradish which complimented everything perfect. 10/10 will make again!

My husband really enjoyed the tuna.  I'm not sure what happened with the sauce - I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but it came out extremely salty and kind of clumpy.  This recipe is worth making, but the sauce drizzled on top needs a little work.  Maybe add more soy sauce... I'm not sure.
