The recipe is a favorite of mine with one exception.  This recipe is only 2/3 of my recipe, which is the reason why everyone is having trouble filling a 13x9 inch pan.  My recipe calls for 3/4 c. butter, 3/4 c. sugar, 3/4 c. brown sugar, 1 egg, 2/3 c. pb, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 c oats, 1 1/2 c flower and 1 1/2 c chocolate chips.  The frosting is the same though.  Also, my recipe only bakes for 12 minutes.  Half the time.  They are delicious this way.  They aren't undercooked.  They are chewy and perfect.  My friend at work says she doesn't even like peanut butter, but loved these.

A tasty treat.  All turned out as expected, sweet and chewy/crunchy, except this really doesn't fill a 9 x 13" pan.  A slightly smaller pan might be good, if you have some weird size (9x9 or 8x8 would be a bit too small), or else fill about 2/3 of 9x13, which bakes fine in 20 minutes.  I used margarine because I was out of butter, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  The drizzle is tasty and not too sweet - do make it!

Excellent!  My peanut butter drizzle didn't come out that great...I think next time it will be just as good without it.  I had to give away half of the pan because I was going to eat all of them myself.  I found that it fit fine in a 13 X 9 pan and it was much easier to put in the pan when I used my hands to flatten it down instead of a spoon.

Really good! Spreading the dough in the pan was a bit of a pain but just because it's pretty thick. Using fingers and the back of a spoon worked for me. I followed the recipe exactly, except it took more like 30 to 35 minutes in the oven. Oh, and instead of drizzling the peanut butter topping, I spread it over the hardened chocolate so that every bite gets both the peanut butter and chocolate. Really yummy! My two-year old enjoyed them a lot! Thanks, Mandy, for a simple and tasty recipe. :)

Boyfriend liked them. I thought they were too much sweetness for me (but i'm not a huge sweets fan). They went together quickly but weren't gobbled up like other recipes I've tried. I used a 9X13 pan, any thicker and the sweetness would have been overpowering for my tastes.

Really good! We really enjoyed these. I cut the confectioners sugar down to 1/3 cup because my husband doesn't like the taste in general and he never even noticed I'd used it in the icing and frankly I kept searching out the peices with the most peanut butter icing because I thought they tasted the best so for those thinking of skipping it - I wouldn't. These are very good and a great way to make a bag of chocolate chips stretch!

I made this dessert for my friends husband- he is a PB lover! everyone loved the dessert... My husband didn't love the oatmeal and I agreed that it made it a little chewier than expected... BUT all in all it was a great hit and the oatmeal didn't stop my family from eating over the half the pain in one night!

I was so happy to find this recipe. My mother too used to make them all the time when we were kids. When she died I thought the recipe was gone. Thanks Allrecipe.

My daughter calls these Gramma's cookies because my MIL always has them for us when we visit. They are my family's favorite! Now I know the recipe and they are so easy to make.

I give it 5 stars because it is quite tasty and such an easy treat to make. I actually double the recipe to fill my cookie sheet... It's a little thicker than what the pictures show, but still delightfully wonderful!

My mom has been making these for years and they are always a hit.  There are only 3 differences--we use quick cooking oats, a 16 oz bag of chocolate chips and we use a jelly roll pan, so i don't quite understand why people say it's not enough dough for 13x9 pan.  You should definitely try these.  They are so worth it.

Made these for hubby. He LOVED them.  I did as other reviewers suggested and baked in an 8x8 pan. I also used chunky peanut butter.  They go together really fast and easy too.  These will get made on a regular basis around here.

This cookie is excellent exactly as it is but for those of you who can't/shouldn't have too much sugar...i substituted splenda white sugar and brown and used whole wheat flour and it is still  excellent.

I made these for a potluck and they disappeared! I substituted raw sugar for white sugar...next time I won't use as much as they seemed a bit overly sweet for my liking. I also topped them with melted chocolate and it was a nice touch.

super yummy, great hit at dinner party. Did not add the peanut butter layer and opted for chocolate only. Was just sweet enough.

I followed the directions exactly but still had to bake them for 30 minutes, and even then the middle seemed a bit iffy. Still, a good dessert, fairly rich but not overwhelming.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My family has been making this for at least 25 years.  I make it anytime I have to bring a dish and everyone loves it!  I usually make it with Crunchy Jif Peanut Butter (I've tried others and it's just not the same).  I make the icing with crunchy PB too and make it in 2 pans.  This is definitely a hit no matter where I take it!

These were really good! i had a craving for something chocolatey and peanut-buttery and this hit the spot! The cookie bottom is nice and chewy and the peanut butter drizzle is divine!  I did find that i had lots of extra peanut butter drizzle when i had finished thoroughly drizzling the bars so i might half that part of the recipe next time.  really good!

Im giving these five stars even though I completely screwed them up!  I thought a 9x13 inch pan was much to big so I used an 8x8 which was perfect.  I had more than enough drizzle so next time I'll cut that in half.  VERY rich but delicious!  I plan on using some of my batch for crushing up over ice cream....cant wait!!

These are reall good! I reccommend using an 8x8 or 9x9 pan. At first I tried the 9x13 pan but it was too thin to spread out so I moved it to the 8x8 and it turned out great!

So good.  I was considering not making the peanut butter sauce, I'm glad I rethought it.  It wouldn't be as good without it.  Easy to make, even with a 2 year old that wanted to do everything!

I can't stop eating these!  Based on other reviews, I used a smaller baking dish (I'm not sure of the dimensions; it is an oval casserole dish).  Otherwise, no changes needed.  I love these!

My husband loves eating peanut butter w/chocolate all the time so when I came across this recipe I had to make it. He loved them!!! These were delicious and I want to make them again but maybe with less sugar next time.

I've been using this recipe for over twenty years and have always gotten rave reviews.  I got this recipe from an old boyfriend's mom when I was a teen.  This is a great potluck dessert recipe.  It's great that someone put it here for everyone to enjoy.  Thanks.

These are delicious oatmeal peanut butter bar cookies made even more amazing with melted chocolate and peanut butter drizzle! I make the cookie part exactly as written but the drizzle recipe I tweak a little, it yields too much and I like it a bit sweeter. I only drizzle a little  bit on, I dont spread it all over because I find it's too much. Some other reviewers say it doesn't really fit in the pan and I agree so next time I will try the suggestions by another reviewer and make more. Don't over bake this! Its great all chewy.

Moist and chewy and full of peanut butter flavor.  I don't think the toppings are necessary, though.  They were just too much.  I might try these again but I can't say they were my favorite.

This is a very moist and yummy treat.  It is different.   Not quite a brownie, but not quite a cookie. It is chewy peanut butter goodness with choclate on top.  I used a small baggie to pipe the drizzle on.  My husband, after three helpings, said it was a keeper.

Thanks for posting this recipe - my mother & I always used to make these when I was a kid, and I couldn't find my recipe book. Thanks for saving the day! PS. I don't spread the peanut butter drizzle out all over the bars when I make them - I just drizzle it back and forth accross the whole pan.  It ends up looking really pretty.

Yum!  These are so good right out of the oven that my family ate half the pan on the spot!  Happily, they are also still great the next day.  Nice crumbly texture and the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate.

My family has loved this recipe for years.  We did add our own little touch by using 2 bags of chocolate chips and 1 bag of butterscotch chips melted on top and it has been used that way in our family since I before me.  We love it, can't stop eating it when I make it.

These are great.  I did not have powdered sugar so instead, warmed the milk in a small pan and dissolved some regular sugar in it, then mixed in the peanut butter.  Worked great!  This used to be my favorite dessert in elementary school -- they always served it when they had beef crumble over mashed potatoes.

Mmmm yum. I quartered the recipe because there's only two of us and I tend to eat dessert until it's gone.  Instead of using 1/4 of an egg, then, I just used an egg white and made it in a bread pan.  Turned out great!

Very good, very easy recipe.  I ended up not doing the topping, just the chocolate chips, since I ran out of time.  But it was a hit anyway.  Will make again. And again.  And again. . .

My husband and I loved this recipe. I was looking for a good combo of chocolate (my favorite) and peanut butter (his). I think this is a good one for all ages, kids and adults alike. The peanut butter drizzle was just slightly too sweet for my taste, so I may reduce the powdered sugar next time, but we will definitely make these again and again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! My husband gave it 5 forks, and he's stingy with the forks!

Delicious! I've been making it for years, but I reduce the glaze to 2 TB each peanut butter and milk, and 1/3 c. powdered sugar.  These are always a hit but I love them most when they are just cooled so the chocolate chips are still melty.

Yum!  My husband had "the best" lunch lady who always made the best food.  He wanted her recipe for peanut butter bars and with his discription of them I found this recipe.  He said that they arent quite like she made them but we all loved this recipe.  You'll need a HUGE glass of milk with these.  They are rich and delicious!

I've been looking long and hard for this recipe and am so happy I found it.  It was easy to make and tasted delicious!!!!  (I substitute chocolate frosting for melted chocolate chips.)
