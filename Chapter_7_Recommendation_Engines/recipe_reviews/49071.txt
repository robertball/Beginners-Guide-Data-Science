This was really good. Reminds me of the one's my mom used to make. Be careful and don't cook too long. Mine looked okay on the outside but were brown on the inside. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I bake mine at 150 degrees F for about 1 and 1/2 hours then shutoff the oven with them still inside ... about another hour. They turn out just perfect. Also make sure it is not humid ... need low humidity or they will be the pancake version.

Not sure about the 1 1/2 hour cooking time. I doubled the recipe and cooked mine about 45 min. and they were still overdone. Next time I think I'll try 30 min. Otherwise very easy to make.

i'll know in about 30 minutes if this is going to work.  i would highly recommend that the word "foamy" be striken and changed to "very stiff".  i nearly burned up a kitchenaid mixer trying to get this stuff to the point where it would form stiff peaks and it actually never did get to that point.  i think i just got finished making very chewy schaum pancakes.

FYI, 6 egg whites is what you need (1/2 c is hard to guess when measuring something like eggs)I put mine all together in one pan (9x13) rather than making individual blobs and cook at 300 for 40 minutes, turn off oven, open oven door and let sit for 30 min and it's done. I also add 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1/4 tsp salt. Yes, the blending takes A LONG TIME even with a mixer. Probably about 15 minutes, so just keep blending :)

Way too much vanilla - gave it a brown color. Also sugar remained grainy and I couldn't get stiff peaks. I was making heart-shaped ones for Valentine's Day and after these failed I went back to Betty Crocker cookbook and those turned out perfectly. I do admit that these tasted good as giant cookies. . .

Used an ice cream scoop to make  individual  shells  of a group. The batch made about 30. Then filled just before serving to maintain crisp shells. It was a great way to use this traditional recipe!

2 cups of sugar seemed like a lot to me, so I reduced it to about 1 2/3 cup & it was still plenty sweet.  Also added 1 tsp cr of tartar.   I'll be making it again, but  with about 1 1/2 cup sugar.

Way too much sugar for, I would cut it in half next time.  Also it would help with the grainy texture of the sugar to use superfine or just pulse regular sugar in the blender a few times.  And lastly, next time I would cut the vanilla down to half because it gave the torte an unpleasant brown color.
