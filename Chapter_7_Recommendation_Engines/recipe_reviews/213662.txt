This was actually pretty good. The fudge base was not normal fudge though. It turned out very dense and kind of hard. It was like a flourless cake but even more dense. The ganache stayed kind of gooey which made it even better. I cooked my bacon in the microwave and didn't cook it until it was rock hard. I also sprinkled some sea salt ontop because my bacon wasn't very salty and I thought it needed the extra saltiness.

This was just ok at best, it was dense fudge not normal fudge, and the bacon was just overkill, it would have been better without.

I mix the bacon in and top with a sprinkle of kosher salt. I personally don't like bacon but my man does. I made it for him and his coworkers one day and he said it was gone with in two hours and he never told anyone it was there. I have been asked many times for it since.
