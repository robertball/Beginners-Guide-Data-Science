Even though I omitted the chile pepper, it was far too spicy to enjoy, and it had an almost bitter taste.  It was awful. Definitely will not
make this again.  A waste of time and money.

I made this and I understand what people were saying now about the flavor being a little off.  In theory the soup was good, but with the weird flavor going on, it sort of negated all the goodness.  I tried to analyze what about it made it that way, and I decided if I make this again, I would omit the poultry seasoning and the sage.  Also, my chicken got a little overcooked.  I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 of a teaspoon and it was the perfect amount of spice - not overpowering, but still a little spicy.

My family LOVED this soup.  The first time I made it I used the rice noodles and thought they were alittle too much, so the second time I used thin egg noodles and enjoyed it more.  Was really very good.

Excellent soup. Take it easy on the black pepper and I added potatoes instead of red pepper. A must to add bean sprouts...My husband begged for more.

Very good and spicy. I didn't have a red pepper so I used a green jalape√±o pepper instead and it turned out very very good. It had just the right amount of spice. I only cooked my soup for like an hour and a half b/c I only made a serving for 4, but it still turned out good. I seriously don't know why this recipe has so many bad reviews. It's a good recipe.

Weird combination of ingredients.  Didn't really like it.  Proportions were weird.  Needed more broth.

A good soup and fairly easy to prepare,but plan ahead because it does require a variety of ingredients and has a lengthy cooking time. "Spicy" is the recipe's first name so you should not be surprised that it is. The combo of flavors makes it unique (if not a bit confusing). It hinted at more of a spicy Italian flavor to me, so I added a teaspoon of sesame oil toward the end of cooking to give it more of an Asian taste. I enjoyed this soup and will likely make it again someday.

At first, the combination of the spices seem wierd and doesn't taste quite right,but after you put in the noodles, squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice into the soup and it is PERFECT! Love it, great for Febuary!

A very nice spicy soup.  We made this soup when we were sick with a cold and it hit the spot.  We didn't have poultry seasoning or white wine, but it still turned out well with just adding extra chicken broth.  Great recipe!

Overall it was just "okay".  I agree with others, the spices were a bit odd.  I am not  sure I liked the poultry seasoning.  Only 1 out of 4 in the family liked it. :(

I love spicy dishes so I decided to try this one. It was good, not great and I made some adjustments. First, I added 2 more cups of chicken broth because there wasn't enough liquid. I wouldn't recommend the whole onion chopped, maybe half. There was too much curry-next time I would cut it in half-I didn't even add the red chile pepper and my mouth was on fire when I first tried it! I used fine no yolk egg noodles instead of the rice noodles, which I cooked separately to avoid the starchy taste. Also, I recommend cutting the oregano in half too-dried spices are too much. I will make this again, but not with too much curry or oregano. The soup was good overall.

Rob, thank you for your excellent submission.  Based on the reviews, I altered this recipe quite a bit, and it was probably one of the best soups I have ever made, no doubt.  I started by making this on the stovetop.  I sauteed the veggies in veg oil, then added the curry powder.  I added 64 oz reduced sodium broth, and then added the other spices.  No poultry sesoning, so in it's place I just added a pinch of rosemary and marjoram.  I did add the full amount of cayene, but did not add the pepper.  I used prepared chicken breast chunks, only about 6 oz, let simmer for about 3 hours on low, and then added about 8 oz thin thai rice noodles.  Simmered for about 10 minutes to let the noodles cook.  It was perfectly spicy this way.  The combination of the curry and sage is fantastic.  Thank you for a great base to a new keeper!

I found this soup a little too spicy for my taste, but I will try it again with the spices cut back. Instead of adding the noodles to the slow cooker I placed some soup in a pot and cooked them separately, this makes the leftovers much better (noodles don't turn to mush).

the key word here is spicy! i like things hot and usually have to kick it up a notch but not this one. if you can't take the heat reduce the cayenne pepper. otherwise i didn't change a thing and it was very good. HTH

This soup was very spicy--and I like pretty spicy food.  I had to add two more cans of broth.  As others have written, this was a very odd combination of spices.  Although edible, I won't make it again.

This soup was great!  Suggestions: 1. break up the noodles before adding to crock pot   2. I used 1/2 the amt of celery   3.  Next time I'll add a bit of cabbage 1/2 way through   4. I left out the curry - it isn't allowed in my kitchen.   Very, very good recipe -- the whole family loved it!  Can't wait to try the leftovers.

I bought julienned vegetables at the grocery store so preparation was extremely easy.  My family liked the finished product a great deal, but I thought it tasted like a jazzed up version of ramen.

My boyfriend & his friend thought the spices were so good that they felt alive!  There was not much liquid after I added the noodles so I had to add 3 more cups of chicken broth.

This soup has loads of flavor that I think would be great on a cold day or if you are a bot congested. I omitted the rice noodles so maybe that had something to do with the high concentration of flavors however I enjoyed the spicyness of the cayane pepper. I reccommend reducing the cooking time as the chicken was tough after the reccomended cook time of 8 hours on low. If I choose to make this soup again, I would only cook it for 3 or 4 hours.

Not terrible, but not great, either. I reduced the quantity of spices per other reviews, and the soup was still quite hot. However, for something with that many different spices in it, it seemed almost bland. I think the spices just didn't blend well, at least for my tastes.

It is spicy, but that is they way it was presented, and I did not have a red chili pepper so I used a green jalepeno.  I added 1 stem of lemon grass, macerated , and I used chicken thighs, other than that the recipe was as given.  I tasted it, it was good, and then a lightbulb went off, add fresh cilantro as a garnish/finishing touch.  Made all the difference in the world. Will make again.  Maybe cut back a little on the hot spices.  Definitely add the cilantro again.  Good recipe.  Thanks.

This is a very good easy soup, although it has many ingredients it is simple and also pretty light.
I substituted paprika for the cayenne pepper.  I could not find a red chile so I used a jalepeno, also I broke the noodles into 1" pieces.

Enjoyed making this soup. It tastes great.  I didn‚Äôt have a fresh red pepper to put into the soup but it was spicy enough without it. I added an additional cup of chicken broth.

I really liked this soup...I started with only 1/8 tsp cayenne and then adjusted to taste. I used red bell peppers instead of chili peppers.

This is better than a traditional chicken noodle soup!  I added a little cabbage and a red pepper. Delicious!

Made it. Terrible. Spicy chicken broth is all it was. Waste of time and money

5 stars with my changes. I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I just added a little marjoram, rosemary, and parsley. I will definitely cut back on the cayenne next time - maybe even in half. It was hot! I didn't even add the red chili pepper. The big change that made the recipe, I think, was that I added 1 Cup half & half to cut the heat and keep the flavor of the cayenne. I know that sounds like a lot, but it only adds 50 calories to each serving and makes it absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again - the husband loved it! Oh, and instead of using the crock pot, I just sauted the veggies, threw them in the broth and spices, then added the pan fried chicken, half and half, and I used rice instead of noodles. Took maybe 45 - 1 hr to make.

Not bad and rather spicy. However, I don't think you need to cook this for quite so long nor do you need a slow cooker for this.

It was a little spicy for my family, but it did have a great overall flavor.  I will make this again, however next time I'll cut down a lot on the cayenne pepper.
