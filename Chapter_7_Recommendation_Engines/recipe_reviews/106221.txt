Thank you all for the wonderful reviews, they mean a LOT to me!  I first came up with this recipe back in 2004 when my husband was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.  It has evolved over the years, with additions, changes, or whatever my mood is.  I now use EVOO and fat-free Italian dressing to equal roughly 1/4 cup (percentage of each is up to your personal tastes)  I have tossed in asparagus, sunflower seeds, and completely switched to black beans about 4 years ago.   The best thing some groceries have ever come up with for a busy working person are chopped veggies, and I have used my share of diced onions, and peppers from the grocery.  I also used the precooked brown rice the last time, worked GREAT!    I had an over abundance of cherry tomatoes last year, and halved a big handful and tossed them in.  Ditto with extra Mini Pearl (grape tomatoes from Trader Joes), those go in whole. I have been known to toss in diced ham or chicken if the carnivores were descending. Happy cooking, and ENJOY!

This is a delicious and beautiful salad! With the addition of carrots, it would have every color in the rainbow (except blue, of course!) and it tastes even better than it looks! I didn't add the mushrooms, because I didn't have any, and I also doubled the amount of salad dressing, because it was a little bland. With these changes, the salad is absolutely fantastic and so healthy! I will definitely make this again; thanks for sharing!

I've been looking for a rice salad recipe for the longest time! I used to work in a coffee house that sold a sunflower-seed-longrain rice salad that I loved, and this recipe is almost EXACTLY the same! I followed the recipe as stated and added shredded carrot and sliced green onion to it. I didn't have any beans, but the salad was just fine without them - although I will try adding chick peas in the future. I used Kraft Golden Italian dressing, and like other reviewers, added MUCH more than the recommended 2 tbsp...I added over 5 tbsp ;P But it's really up to the individual - if you like more dressing, then this recipe allows you to add more without ruining the combined flavours :) My family like this recipe so much that I had to make ANOTHER batch the next day! And my hubby suggested I make this salad for upcoming family functions :) I will continue making this salad, especially during the summer when I like eating lighter :P

I made this recipe as written (except I forgot to pick up a green pepper, but I did have orange, yellow, and red).  Oh, and I used *minute* rice because I'm lazy.  It's pretty good.  I can't decide how I feel about it, but Mr. LTH liked it!  It's most def worth trying!!!  I had it for lunch and thought it was ok.  Then, for dinner, I added a splash of banana pepper juice and a shake of parm cheese (I would have chopped up some banana peppers and added them too, but, I'm lazy) and that really made a difference for me!  I will prob make again, as it is a very nutrient dense all-in-one side!  Thanks for a unique recipe (and thanks to LARKSPUR for mentioning it on the RE!)!

Like a lot of the other reviews, we added quite a bit more salad dressing than the recipe called for.  I served it for guests and everyone liked it. I think the kidney beans and slivered almonds really made this unique. It is pretty, healthy, has a great texture, and tastes really good, too.  Will make again - Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE this salad! Simple and refreshing. I did add a little more salad dressing and omitted the olive oil. I also added a couple sliced pepperoncinis.  I will be making this again and again, thank you! :)

This was awesome!  I used more rice (made it in my rice cooker, and added salt, which this dish needed!), and a LOT more veggies: a whole crown of broccoli (cooked in the microwave for 3 minutes with 2 Tbl. water), 1/2 cup green bell pepper, 1/2 cup red bell pepper, 1/2 cup yellow bell pepper, and 1/2 pkg fresh mushrooms.  Also, I toasted the almonds to bring out the flavor.  Since I added more ingredients, I needed to double the dressing & olive oil, and add a bit more pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a barbeque and it was enjoyed by all.  I cheated and used minute brown rice.  I did use more dressing than the recipe called for and my husband said he thought it was still a little dry.  The little bit I did bring home tasted even better after sitting in the fridge for another day.

I love this salad... so different with the rice.  I used pecans because I was out of almonds.  Also, I used Italian dressing and added a little vinegar.  Just a personal preference.  Everything else was as listed and is a keeper!

Very good recipe.  I used pecans instead of almonds and an oil/sugar/vinegar dressing instead of Italian dressing.   Love the combination of flavors.  Will use this for lunch at work.

Added pomegranate-infused craisins to this for a slightly sweet element.  I added more nuts, walnut and pine, because I love them!  I agree that this needed a lot more dressing.  Added some other seasonings like seasoned pepper, shallot salt, etc because I felt it needed a bit more kick--but season to taste!  People at a gathering loved this and is a nice change from potato salad.

SOOOOOO  good!!!  I am trying to watch what I eat and this fit the bill, plus it is super tasty.  The changes I made were: 1) omitted the mushrooms 2) didn't have a yellow bell pepper, so just chopped up 1 whole green pepper and 1 whole red pepper and used them  3) added in a little bit of garlic salt 4) doubled the evoo and dressing per other reviews 5) used black beans as opposed to kidney beans 6) used sliced almonds (and probably had a bit more than 2 tbs).  It's easy to throw together and now I will have lunch on hand for the next few days.  THANK YOU for sharing such a delicious & nutrient dense recipe!

Since I doubled this recipe, I added one can of garbanzo beans with the one can of kidney beans. As other reviewers stated, more dressing (approx. 3/4 C. in doubled recipe) was needed to give it flavor and moisture. To add a little more zip, I splashed in some red wine vinegar to taste. I think I would add more almonds next time and either sliced or slivered to get more crunch from them. It is a beautiful combination of colors and delicious!

Great idea for a salad that is low in fat and tastes good! I followed it pretty closely but also added some diced tomatoes with chilies to give it some oomph. And garlic (which I add to most non-dessertables). Served the salad in hollowed-out assorted grilled bell peppers, which made for a nice presentation. Don't omit the almonds - the crunch gives this dish great texture. Thanks for a nice summer recipe.

I was really excited about trying this recipe but the outcome was kind of a let down. Sure this is healthy salad, but that's about all it has going for it. It taste like eating cold rice, which I guess I just realized is not very pleasing to my palate.. I plan on trying to mix the leftovers into some chicken enchilada recipe. 
My husband like it ok, so it could just be me. But when it comes to salads there are a lot of others I'd recommend before this.

We have anti-Italian dressing people in the household so I had to nix that part of the recipe, leaving the flavor somewhat bland. I added some chopped jalapenos and cayenne to spice it up and thought it was delicious.

Very good and versaltile.  You can easily add or omit vegetables.  We're trying to "Eat to Live" and this fits the plan pretty well.

Just tried this and we really love it. I had a couple of snafus, but it worked out okay. I used sweet brown rice, but had just under a cup of it. I mistakenly used a 2:1 ratio when I boiled the water, so I ended up just rinsing with cold water in a strainer. Added benefit - immediately cool rice. I then discovered that I had no can of kidney beans... ummm... quickly improvising, I omitted the beans and used champagne dressing instead of italian, thinking I could play it off as a broccoli/pepper/lemon/garlicky Italian style flavor. Bingo. So aside from screwing up completely on the base, it is really good. Still refrigerating a bit to serve with some baked chicken aux herbes de provence and fresh artichokes. Nom.

I really enjoyed this healthy option for a side dish.  I added two more TBSP of Fat Free Italian Dressing to it (not that big of a difference in caloric intake and did add to the flavor).

Simple, easy and delicious! The only thing I would change is adding a little more dressing. You can easily adapt this recipe to your taste or use whatever leftovers you have in the fridge. Really enjoyed this!

Prepared for a BBQ and it was a success.  I just removed the broccoli since when used with the same friend for other recipes they complained about them therefore I decided to leave them out. but still a great recipe.

This is a perfect recipe for the Daniel Fast. Everything is healthy. It could have used a pinch more of seasoning overall.

Really enjoyed this salad. May have added more dressing than listed and sub'd cashews for almonds since I don't like them much. Very good!!!

Nutty is right! I love these kind of Everything-But-The-Kitchen-Sink salads that are healthy with a lot of vegetables. My only complaint is the 1/4 cup amounts for each of the veggies, not even close to enough so I added much more.  Otherwise I loved it.  The dressing amount was fine for me, I used a very strong dressing I made myself. Used Wehani rice which is a chewy, nutty red rice.  I served this as a side dish, but this is actually a meal all unto itself.

I liked this recipe, but cooked rice in chicken broth for more flavor.  I also blanched the broccoli & put it immediately in ice water to get brighter color.  Also needed to add more dressing.

Works great as a salad-in-a-jar. Just layer dressing, celery, rice, beans, then your soft veggies and some spinach.

We both LOVE this. Great recipe. So delicious and yet simple. I didn't add mushrooms out of personal taste and next I would add a little more olive oil and Italian dressing. The flavors are great.

LOVED by everyone in my family (and some co-workers too)!  Other than a lot of chopping, super-easy and well worth the effort.

Looks very pretty, but is a little boring. It's a nice summer side dish though.
