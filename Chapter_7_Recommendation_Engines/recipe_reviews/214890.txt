Delicious - plus it's great for a quick and easy lunch! I used leftover rotisserie chicken vs. canned. (sorry Hormel) I used green onion since no type was specified and left out the almonds since I didn't have any on hand. I used Hellman's light mayo cut with a bit of reduced fat sour cream and used more than 1/3 cup. I added 1/4 tsp. of curry powder for a bit of a kick along with a bit of salt and pepper. I let it chill for an hour as directed and it was very tasty on toasted whole grain bread - great combination of sweet and crunchy!

Very good.  Quick and easy with my mini chopper.   Instead of the canned chicken, I used some deli turkey I had to use up.  I also had to replace the almonds with toasted pecans because they were all I had on hand.  Yum!

Yum! I am not a fan of raisins or cranberries so i left them out but added some fresh sliced strawberries instead for the same sort of effect. Loved it!

Great recipe!  A couple of modifications I made were that I did not use dried cranberries or golden raisins (was out of both), but I did chop up half of a Rome apple and added about 1/4 cup chopped walnuts instead of almonds.  I also added a heaping tablespoon more of the salad dressing than is called for, because I like my chicken salad to be more "blended" and cohesive.  Overall, great recipe!

Easy, yummy, and quick.  I made this for a baby shower yesterday, served on mini croissants. All but one sandwich was gone.  Unfortunately I'm gluten intolerant so had to forgo the sandwiches, but the filling was awesome!  I have some filling left over and am thinking of throwing it on top of salad for lunch today.  What intrigued me was the cranberries.  I figured it would be a great addition, and I was right.  I added ground ginger, but because I wasn't certain how it would go with the mix, used it sparingly.  Next time I'll add more.  I'm not a huge canned chicken fan, but was short of time.  One of these times when I make this recipe again, I'll cook fresh chicken.

I use leftover chicken breast, chop it up and use instead of canned chicken. Also good with walnuts for pecans instead of almonds. Red onions instead of reg. white onion- a little sweeter.

Great version of this classic!!!  I added a tablespoon of honey for sweetness as well as finely chopped apples as some other reviewers suggested.  Stopped by Costco yesterday for delicious croissants to make these sandwiches perfect!

We really enjoyed this chicken salad, the only difference was that I used cashews instead of almonds. I served this on croissants. It was delicious and just what I was looking for!

So much opportunity for ad libbing... didn't follow exactly - used what I had but such a GREAT recipe!  I used red and green grapes, grilled chicken chunks, no golden raisins or celery, and used whole wheat rounds. Fabulous!

This is a really great recipe for when I am wanting chicken salad fast. Also, I make many substitutions and yet it still turns out excellent!  Today, instead of the grapes, I added diced strawberries, and chopped dates instead of the cranberries/raisins.  Also, used Vegenaise instead of Mayo.  This is an awesome and simple recipe!
