First:  Definately roast squash first as others have recommended: slice in half, scoup out seeds, place in pan sliced side down in a little water at 375 for about 35 minutes or until done. (or just poke a few holes and bake whole!)  Then you can just use a spoon to scoop out the soft cooked flesh.  Second:  Use the best vegetable broth you can buy.  It makes the soup.  Mine actually tasted better BEFORE I added the 1/2 cup of light cream.  Next time I'd probably leave it out or add less and use half and half.  Third:  Go easy with the nutmeg.  It is powerful stuff and not everyone likes it.  Can easily be added a tiny sprinkle at a time at the very end to individual bowls.

I loved this & it was such a beautiful soup! (I only gave 4 stars because I think the recipe would have been semi-bland as written) I did roast my squash & then scooped out the insides...much easier than trying to peel it. I could hardly get it cut in half (with a  very sharp knife)...can't imagine trying to peel it.  I added half a golden delicious apple (pelled, cored & sliced) when I added the carrots & wish I had added the other half. I didn't add the squash until the carrots were done since it was alreday cooked. I also added a huge clove of minced garlic (threw it in when the onion was almost done). I used one cup of chicken broth I had in teh fridge & two cups of vegetable broth & I added a bay leaf as well as some cayenne. It added great flavor but I went a little heavy on the cayenne...it was just a bit too spicy. Used an immersion blender to puree (love that thing!) & I did add the cream, pulling it off the heat as soon as it was added, to keep the cream from separating.  I garnished w/ two long sprigs of chives crossed over each other w/ a small dollop of organic yogurt where they intersect. Grated fresh nutmeg over all...it was really, really beautiful. Debated as to whether I should top the dollop of yogurt w/ some of the squash seeds I roasted but decided against it because I didn't want to interfere w/ the smooth texture of the soup. Thansk  for a wonderful, seasonal soup PHONELADY55...we enjoyed it!

OHMIGOSH! If I could give this 10 stars I would! This was absolutely amazing soup! Since peeling this squash is difficult, I followed another reviewer's idea and sliced the squash lengthwise, scooped out the seeds, turned face down in a baking dish, covered with 1 inch of water, covered dish with foil and baked in a 375 degree oven for 30-45 minutes. This made getting to the squash much easier than trying to peel and cube it! For the stock I used 3 cups of frozen juices I'd been saving up from leftover roasts and such. I'm not sure if this is what gave the soup such an incredible taste, but it was simply fabulous! I did use heavy cream and I would recommend this to everyone because tasting the soup before adding it and after, the cream just gave it the special extra touch it needed! I used an immersion blender to blend all the ingredients rather than trying to transfer to a blender. I highly recommend this soup! I don't typically get so excited over soup - but this was awesome!    PS: I had a small patty pan squash I also threw in there!

Why turn on the oven when a microwave will do it in 1/3 the time?  I cook butternut squash (and others) by cutting them in half, scooping out the seeds, laying the halves on a flat platter, covering with plastic wrap, and microwaving for 10 minutes or so.  Test doneness with a fork, or you will see the shell start to collapse.  
Simply scoop squash out of the shell, and use as you wish.  Also, if I want to cook squash cut up, I use my heaviest knife to bully through it, then the pieces are easy to peel with a large paring knife.  Long live butternut squash!!!

Fantastic soup. I'm not so good with measuring things in cups, so this is what I used: 2 butternut squash, cooked then peeled and cubed. 1/2 white onion. 3 carrots. 1 can chicken, 1 can veggie broth. 2/3 cup of half and half instead of cream. Lots of nutmeg, salt and cracked pepper. My additions to the recipe: 1 teaspoon minced garlic. 2 small peeled and chopped green apples (a good tart variety) and a splash of orange juice while cooking, about 1/4 cup of all natural, unsweetened juice - these add a brightness to the flavor, otherwise it could be a bit heavy and flat tasting. I also added a good teaspoon or two of ground cayenne. Will make over and over!

You may want to roast the squash first (used 1 medium butternut squash) by slicing into quarters and baking at 350 degrees for about and hour (without adding water to pan--keeps flavor better). I skipped the butter, and tried using a tablespoon of cream cheese to thicken soup since I didn't have heavy cream and wanted to keep it healthy. And if you don't like onions, DO NOT WORRY--you will not be able to taste them! Such a simple recipe! Highly recommended.

In spite of the fact that I added fresh garlic and a dose of white wine, this was flat and basically tasteless. It might be a good start or base for additional seasonings--maybe cumin, curry or herbs?

I didn't feel like peeling and cubing my squash so I halved it and roasted the halves face down on a baking sheet with a shallow layer of water, and covered it with tinfoil at 375F for 40 minutes.
This made the recipe INCREDIBLY easy to prepare, put together, and cook.
Tasty and filling! A family pleaser

***ALSO, I found that 1 cooked squash = 5 cups***

This was very tasty!  I added half of  a golden delicious apple and used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.  I used an immersion blender to puree the soup and that saved me from having to puree it in batches in my food processor.  Peeling and cubing the butternut squash was more time-intensive than I realized.  Next time I will probably roast the squash in the oven while I chop, saute, and simmer the other vegetables.  Then I can just scoop it out easily and add it to the pot after the carrots and onion are tender.

This was a good soup.  I will add garlic next time and bay leaf because it was too sweet for me.  I found no need for the cream either.  Very easy if you put the squash in microwave for 10 mins, cool and then halve and peel!

Delicious recipe for a cold day.  This was not a difficult recipe, but it involves lots of chopping.  The butternut squash is hard to cut and skin, but it was worth it.  I added some chopped smoked ham at the end of the recipe which gave the soup a burst of flavor.

Thank you for the comments - they were very usefull.  I followed many of the suggestions as well as added my own small changes to make the soup more flavorful and full bodied: I roasted all the vegetables including carrots, a red pepper, of course the butternut, as well as a whole head of garlic in olive oil.  Added a few chillies to the onion when sautéing and added the roasted garlic purée (which was squeezed out from the whole head of the roasted garlic).  Once all was combined I added 1/2 cinnamon stick to the soup with the flavorings after the broth was added (I used homemade beef and chicken broths).   At the end I adjusted for taste by adding some honey, since I found the final product not quite sweet enough.  It came out a very flavorful bisque and definitely not flat or tasteless as some commenters may have found.  This recipe is an excellent starting point and definitely holds its own.  Enjoy.

This was really good.  I subbed olive oil for the canola (I don't like to use Genetically Modified products and canola is usually GM) and coconut oil for the butter, since I was making this for a vegan friend.  I did not microwave the  squash since that takes so many nutrients out of the squash.  I didn't have time to roast it in the oven, so I peeled it with a vegetable peeler, which worked really well.  It *was* hard to chop, but not impossible.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a bay leaf, a dash of cayenne (not too much), and about 2 cloves minced garlic.  The flavor was excellent and I did not feel the need to add anything else (I considered adding coconut milk instead of the cream but ended up just omitting them both).  I'm not usually a huge fan of butternut squash soup, but I would make this again.  Thanks!

This was just too bland for me, and not as thick as I would have liked.  Next time I would use less vegetable stock, substitute sour cream for the heavy cream, and add more nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and a bit of brown sugar.

Great soup! My boyfriend said it was the best butternut soup he'd ever had (and he's a connoisseur of butternut soups).

I tweaked the recipe per the previous suggestions to save calories: I doubled the recipe, and roasted around 4 pounds of precut butternut squash at 450 degrees for 25 minutes in a roasting pan   covered with olive oil cooking spray).   I chopped up 2 small granny smith apples  in addition to the carrots.Used 1/2 tbs of olive oil and 1/2 tbs unsalted butter, and stirred in 1cup onions with 1 tbs of garlic. Added 1/2 cup of sherry, which brought out the flavor (Harvey's bristol cream, my fav). Used 4 cups of fat free vegetable stock and 2 cups of chicken broth. Instead of heavy cream, I used 1 cup plain low fat yogurt (stir in slowly, it created chunks when I dropped the whole cup in). For the final touch, I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. It came out thick, flavorful and fantastic!

This was a great recipe- I didn't really measure anything and decided to roast my butternut squash instead of just peeling and cubing (soooo much easier and adds taste!). I didn't have any nutmeg, so I put a little bit of cinnamon and added some sugar as well. My homemade vegetable stock was pretty heavy on the thyme, so I had to add extra cream, cinnamon and sugar to even it out and make it sweeter. The soup was very thick as well.

I've made this recipe close to a dozen times and we think it's fantastic.  It's also gotten rave reviews from company.  I've tried both peeling the squash and baking it and prefer the peeling method.  A little faster with less cleanup.  I also use the fat free half and half.  I've given the recipe out six times so far!  Thanks for sharing.

I liked this, and I made the stock using the Bramblett's Vegetable Stock recipe also on this site. I found the resulting texture to be similar to Canadian pea soup. I agree with another reviewer that if you are going to add the cream, to do so only when you're ready to serve so it will last longer in the fridge.

This was so delicious! I roasted the squash in the oven as others suggested. I sauteed the onion along with minced garlic, shredded carrots and the seasonings to bring out the flavors more, then added the roasted squash to the mixture. I used organic veggie broth and since all I had on hand was evaporated milk, I used that in place of the cream, which worked wonderfully. I served the soup w/toasted ciabatta bread with melted havarti cheese - what a fabulous meal! My hubby and 19-year old son both raved about this soup...I will definitely make again!

Wonderful recipe! I did not have any vegetable stock so I used 1 cup beef broth and two cups chicken broth.
I microwaved the squash for 5 min and it sure was easier to remove the skin.

I was very reluctant to try butternut squash soup, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I did not add the cream but did add a little skim milk to thin out the bisque.  I also added a little cayenne and more nutmeg than the recipe called for.  To cook the butternut squash, I followed other reviewers’ suggestions:  I sliced the squash, removed the seeds, and placed it face down in a casserole dish.  Added 1 inch of water covered with aluminum foil, and baked in a preheated 375* oven for about 30 minutes (feel for softness).  The softer, the better!  This is a great fall recipe and I’m sure it would be even better with the cream.

A great flavorful soup!  Next time, however, I will use half and half with the same amount of heavy cream to dilute the base more.  (I don't usually measure so I may have used more than the 4 cups of squash the recipe called for.  It turned out quite thick.) I served this with lean pork, San Francisco veggies and a green leaf salad with Parmesan cheese.  Very, very elegant dinner with no fuss.

This was great - I did roast the squash before-hand and I thought the carrots provided extra texture and color - we put bacon bits on top and salted to taste...I usually like to put a bit of green onion and sour cream drop on top of each bowl too...this recipe was easy to prepare though! Thanks!

I followed a lot of others by adding a tart apple, garlic, herbs, and one large russet potato, which broke down and make the soup creamier.  Also added 1/2 cup fat free evap milk.  Couldn't tell the difference and tasted great.  With the additions, I give it 5 stars-or more if I could.

I love soup, especially in the winter, but I think this may be my favorite.  I roast the squash first (cut in half, take out the seeds, lay cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet, and roast at 375 F) and add lots of garlic and freshly ground nutmeg and black pepper.  I do add some heavy cream because I think it makes this soup really "gourmet".

As others have said, this bisque was surprisingly good.  Buy the pre-cut and peeled squash. If you don't, use gloves to cut and peel or your skin will develop a squash film that is hard to remove and quite drying.  Believing that all things Fall should be roasted, I cubed and roasted all my veggies and this added an extra dimension to the bisque.  With adjustments noted by others, this is extremely WeightWatcher friendly.

Excellent!  I cut the oil and butter in half, and used fat-free half and half instead of cream.  Wonderful!  Although the recipe said to peel the squash, I didn't (skin was too thick to use a potato peeler, and I was pressed for time - didn't feel like peeling it with a knife).  Big mistake!  Even though I pureed the soup, I could still detect a bit of peel in each bite.  I'll know better next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Cream or no cream...the burning question. I tried it both ways. Hands down I liked it better without the cream. However it was 5 stars either way :D I think, honestly, that the only reason I liked it better without the cream was because I used this outstanding homemade stock I had made the day before!  This was a fabulous recipe!!!  Thank you so much for sharing it! It was the perfect addition to the care package I am making for my mother after her surgery and was so good for dinner for my grandfather and I.  I know I will be making this again and again. xoxoxoxoxoxo

I roughly cut the onions into big chunks and then slightly carmelize the onions.  Definitely roast the butternut squash and carrots before adding to the onions, then I carmelize a little bit more with the onions too.  You can substitute the veggy broth with chicken broth also.  And I put about an 1/8-1/4 teaspoon nutmeg only in the whole soup along with about the same amount of white pepper to add just a note of "pepperyness" to make it interesting. The cream is not necessary I find as it dulls the flavor of the squash, but to make it look pretty when I serve it I pipe in a swirl of plain yogurt and top off with a few sprigs of chives.

Very easy and good soup!  I doubled the batch and used skim milk instead of the heavy cream (to keep healthier / lower fat).  Still very good!  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bake the squash first here but I did (baked in oven - 350 for 1 hour / lengthwise after cleaning it out).  It was very good - will be making again and freezing some for later this season!

Oh WOW is this GOOD!!!! I omitted the cream based on other reviewers and also skipped the butter/onion saute...don't need it! I just blended the carrots/squash with my stick blender until smooth, added salt, fresh cracked pepper and nutmeg (about a teaspoon...could use more, will season leftovers to taste).  Thanks Phonelady55 for the AWESOME recipe!

AWESOME!  Smooth and creamy. I scaled recipe to 2 servings because the squash was small. Had to sub chicken broth in place of vegetable. Roasted squash in 375 oven for 35 minutes. I did not transfer to my blender, but used my immersion blender right in the pan. With my garden full of this squash, I will be making this recipe again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2004 and served it in little pumpkins, I used the stem of the pumpkin as a place card holder. Not only did the table setting look stunning but the soup was highly complimented and everyone asked for seconds!!

This was really very good and easy to make. However, since I'm on the paleo diet I made a few substitutions, none of which negatively affected the recipe, and might I say improved it! For example I used EVOO instead of canola oil, I eliminated the butter, and I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. It still had a very creamy texture to it. Again, a really very good, simple recipe.

I'm in love! I give this 5 stars because of the wonderful tips and additions given by other reviewers. For me personally, I always read the reviews and they become part of the recipe so I think it's fair to 5-star a recipe even if it ends up being a bit different than the original. Like many others, I halved my approx. foot long squash and baked the 2 halves. I sprinkled the cut sides with nutmeg. While it was cooking, I cooked half an onion in some olive oil with 1tsp jarred minced ginger, added carrots and an entire gala apple cored but unpeeled. I added my pepper here along with a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon (no salt). I added my carton of vegie stock (I realized too late that it was almost 4 cups). When I diced my roasted squash, I felt the amount of stock would be fine compared to how much squash I had. Brought it to a boil and simmered on low for an hour as I had to run out the door. When I got back, I dumped it all into my super duper blender and let it run until no more chunks were visible, poured it back into a pot and tested it out. The texture and consistency were perfecto! The taste was deadly!!! I didn't add cream as we have lactose issues but I was thinking if serving to guests, a decorative splash of plain whipping cream would be mind blowing. The only thing I would change from what I did was only add nutmeg once, either on my squash before baking or when cooking the other vegies. This soup was restaurant quality and I'm thinking w/out cream it'll freeze well.

This recipe was amazingly easy and very good. I had a pre-Thanksgiving party with my family so I doubled the recipe. I took the suggestions of a few reviewers and roasted the squash and carrots with a little butter first, and I added a gala apple. Next time, I will take the suggestion of another reviewer, and find some that is already cut up (getting that sqash broken down was a true labor of love!). I used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, but the squash still remained the star. I probably used a bit more seasoning that the recipe calls for and I also added a little cayenne pepper. The soup was great right after I made it, but the cream really kicked it up a notch. I made it the night before and then reheated it in my crockpot about 30 minutes before I was ready to serve it. I got rave reviews on it and served it with some roast chicken and baked potatoes. I think I will make this every year!

Overall this is a very tasty recipe. Like others, I skipped the cream and the nutmeg. I also roasted the squash instead of peeling and boiling. In an effort to make this even healthier, I avoided the butter/oil by simply cutting the vegetables smaller and simmering them in the broth for longer to soften them. The color of this bique is beautiful and just so perfect on a cool fall day!

Great recipe.Thank you. I roasted the squash, carrots, and onions with minced garlic and a tablespoon of olive oil and just a touch of brown sugar for 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Then I threw it in the crock pot with the remaining ingredients. I substituted 4 cups of chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and 1 tablespoon of earth balance margarine instaed of butter and it turned out great. My huband and I both liked it and one of my three kids liked it too. 1 out of three ain't bad with my picky kids!

Love this soup!  I skip the stock and use all FF half and half. Never used a carrot, I use apple instead, sautéing it with the onion. I also roast the squash in halves, much easier. (about 1/2 hr or so at 400) Just pop in the stick blender and purée away. I spice mine with Ginger and white pepper. Then I get to take it to work for lunch all week.  Yum!!

I just made this soup tonight. I had a 1lb 4 oz box of cubed ready to eat butternut squash and needed something to do with it. I used olive oil instead of canola oil, it's healthier and creates a better flavor. I roasted the veggies before adding the stock. I didn't have vegetable stock so I used chicken stock instead. The only thing I would say to advise future cooks using this recipe is use a low sodium stock. If not, then taste it before you add any salt. They make those stocks with plenty of sodium so you probably won't need to add any. I also suggest not adding the cream to the whole pot but to the individual serving bowls. Your soup will keep longer in your fridge if you do this. In fine dining restaurants they pour the cream into the bowls and create designs, who would have thought that soup could be fancy.

The carrots add a great dimension of flavor to the butternut squash.  I barely used any cream, and it would taste great without it too.  I added a dash of red pepper flakes and rosemary.

Peeling and cubing a butternut squash is never an easy task, but trust me, you will be rewarded when you taste this bisque.  I roasted the squash at 400F for about 45 minutes and used FF half and half.  This is the first time I've ever cooked with vegetable stock (always use Kitchen Basics brand for stocks and broths).  I had some chicken stock in the fridge, but I'm so glad I stuck to the recipe and used the vegetable stock.  I really think it enhanced the flavor.  This is a great bisque!

Fabulous! I made this exactly as written except I omitted the carrots only because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added a bit of cinnamon to it and that really gave it some extra flavor.  I also used a pretty good amount of salt and nutmeg.  Would absolutely make again!

So yummy! I had never made anything with butternut squash before so I had to investigate the best way to cook it. Turns out roasting it first is a lot easier than killing yourself trying to cube it- like this recipe calls for. Get a very sharp knife and cut it in half, place face down on 9x12 pan with a 1/4 cup water- bake for an hour at 350. Begin the recipe as it states and once the carrots get soft throw in the softened squash. Also, I used chicken stock instead of veggie stock and it gave it a more savory flavor. Half n half worked well instead of heavy cream. I will makes this again and again! :)

GREAT SOUP-I doubled the recipe. I baked 1 medium-lrge sized squash, cut in half and face down on baking sheet.Cooked 350 for about 40min. Minced 1 medium onion and 5 lrge whole carrots-cooked in canola oil and butter first-covered for 15 min(until soft) I added 1 pint of heavy whipping cream and 2 32oz containers of great quality vegetable stock. I added garlic powder; ground cloves, ground nutmeg, ground cinnamon and ground ginger to taste.(A definite must!) Cooked on stove top for 1 hour, then pureed in blender-thickens it beautifully! Great recipe,creamy and delicious. Serve with fresh, hot sour dough bread! Ummhhh! But make sure you add the spices I did- it really makes it a wonderful fall comfort food! I even baked the squash seeds and tossed on top to serve...

I added only a tiny bit of milk because I thought the soup tasted great without it. I roasted the butternut squash first, for around 35 minutes at 375 F. BTW I know that most people scoop out the flesh but I find it easier and much less messy to simply peel the skin--when cooked, it is soft.

Very delicious.  I baked the squash because it's easier than peeling & cutting, plus the roasted flavor is nice.  I sauteed the carrots with the onions, seasoned with salt and pepper.  Chicken stock was what I had.  I used my hand blender to break it down slightly (I like some lumps).  After adding the baked squash it was very thick so I added evaporated skim milk (instead of cream).  I also added about 1/4 tsp. of crushed thyme for a little savory taste. Thanks for the recipe!

I messed around with the recipe a bit and the results were terrible! Here is what I did so you can avoid the mistakes I did.

I had only one butternut squash, so I used it and rounded out the recipe with an extra carrot (I used a total of 4 smallish ones) and a large potato. I used 1/2 a white onion, and chicken stock instead of veggie because that is what I had on hand. I added about 1/2T of chopped garlic, a dash of cayenne, and a couple good pinches of curry spices (one custom blended called kashmir krush, it's kind of like garam masala.) I also used almost a full cup of half and half in place of the cream.

The result was a gloppy, tasteless mess! It was way too thick, salty, and had heat without any real flavor at all. You could taste the curry, and taste the nutmeg, but it is like the spices were competing and canceling each other out. Mostly it was bland and flavorless, except a bit salty!

I'd try it again I think without the garlic / curry / cayenne, and go for a sweeter soup. Maybe a dash of molasses or something to brighten it. But as I made it it was pretty blech (and we normally LOVE squash and LOVE curried anything.) Don't mess it up like I did!

This was so simple and incredibly delicious!  I baked the squash for 1 hour at 350 degrees, then simply scooped into the blender with the broth/onion/carrot mix.  Pureed, and into the pan with cream, salt and white pepper.  Wonderful!  So seasonal and totally deeelish!

If you could rate this recipe any higher, I would. A few alterations: Bake squash 45 min. @375 deg. Add curry powder while sautéing  the onions. Add cinnamon and allspice. & Add 1/2 cup OJ while cooking. This makes a fantastic Bisque! My dad loves it. Every time he sees a Butternut Squash he begs mom and me to make this.

This soup is soooo good! I haven't made a soup recipe that I haven't had to significantly alter to taste right in a long time! The spices are right and the only things I changed were that I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and half & half instead of heavy cream, because that is what I had on hand. I've already made this a few times this year and will keep this one for the posterity! Even non-soup eaters like this! Great!

A delicious soup!  I added in one Granny Smith apple which added a nice touch of sweetness, 2 cloves garlic and some curry powder with the onion, and a little cinnamon, and I ommitted the cream.  For a fancy dinner I would probably go ahead and add the cream, but for a regular night it's delicious and much healthier without it!

After alot of ajustments this came out pretty good. Used 1/2 cup canned pumpkin in lieu of carrots (did not have any carrots),baked squash and scooped out---no chopping. Used 4 cups chicken stock, 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 in lieu of heavy cream, 1/2 t marjoran, 1/2 t nutmeg and generous salt and pepper.Can only imagine how bland this recipe would be without these ajustments.  Will serve this tommorrow as "Jacko Lantern Soup"---eeeek! Happy Halloween.

Holy Harvest, this was great!  I would give this six stars if I could.  The previous reviewer was correct - this is a very elegant dish.  Easy too.  Used fat-free half and half and chicken broth.  Tried it on company without testing it first and we all loved it.  Next time I'll toss some chopped avocado on top before serving. Sure glad I have more squash in the garden!

Made this for the first time tonight and it's just wonderful.  I did make a few adjustments to make sure it wasn't bland (added a diced jalapeno & a little ginger), didn't bother with the cream but added a dollop of sour cream to my bowl...YUM!  Can't wait to have some more tomorrow!  Thanks so much for sharing. 
(OH, definitely cook the squash first - I pierced it and put it in the oven at 350 for @40min and it was so easy to manage)

I’ve made several recipes for butternut squash soup and this recipe was the least complex.  I expected we’d like it, but I was surprised we all loved it.  I used roasted butternut squash that I had grown in my garden, freshly grated nutmeg, and my homemade chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth just because I prefer the richness of the chicken broth in the bisque.  Simple basic flavors that were perfect.  I may add a granny smith apple the next time just as a personal preference but it is perfectly wonderful without it.

This was excellent! Everyone who has tried it says that it tastes like its resturant quality. 

The only seasoning I added in addition to what is required was a bit of garlic powder and all spice. The heavy cream really finishes the bisque nicely. It makes it very rich and silky. 

Keeping this recipe for sure and will be making it again soon.

Made it twice & a hit both times! The second time I wanted it a little more savory (served as a starter at Thanksgiving), so I added fresh thyme & garlic. Still sweet, but really nice. I really didn't have trouble peeling it the 1st time, but I cut it in half & roasted it in the oven this time, which got some nice carmelization going. My 2 yr old son loves it as much as we do!

I roasted the squash in the oven first.  I only added enough nutmeg to enhance the soup's flavor, not to give it a nutmeg taste.  Used chicken stock because that's what I keep in my kitchen, but I will make a vegetable stock for this next time because I think it would taste better.  Also only added a splash or so of the cream.  VERY tasty.  I will absolutely make this again!

I really wish I could have tried this recipe as is, but I was making it for my boyfriend and he has gastric reflux disease so I had to doctor it significantly so that he could have it too.  I made three cups of chicken broth with boullion cubes and brought it to a boil.  I then added the carrots to that along with one pealed and sliced gala apple. While that was cooking, I baked the squash on 375 for 35 minutes, as was suggested by other reviewers.  When it was done, I added it into the soup along with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and blended all of it in the blender five minutes later.  It turned out delicious--especially when I added dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to mine!

Excellent cold-weather dish, except skip the nutmeg (it tends to overpower the other flavors). Be sure to fully sautee the onions so the onion taste stays mild. I use a microwave on the high setting for five minutes to soften the squash for easier peeling. Have Cayene powder available for those who want to "warm" it up a bit on their individual servings.

A decent base recipe, but it tasted a little thin on flavor when I tested it as is. I added a few extra ingredients to punch it up: 2 cloves garlic after the onions had turned translucent, and some thyme, sage, and a tiny bit of Chinese 5-spice mix. I omitted the cream. Garnished with toasted squash seeds. Delicious!

I made this for lunch. Although it was very tasty and easy to make it dirtys a lot of dishes. I roasted the squash as recommended by others but it was almost as hard to peel off the skin (and not lose a lot of squash) as it would have been if it was peeled raw. I did save on cutting though. I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of vegetable stock because that is what I had on hand. Very good and think soup. I will make this again.

This soup is out of this world!  I was suprised by all the super ratings and thought I'd give it a whirl.  I added just a touch of nutmeg, which was perfectly suitable.  I also added about 5 or 6 cups of squash because I had cooked it and didn't want it to go to waste.  This made the soup a terrific texture and consistency.  I would recommend adding more squash each time because of this.  I ended up using half and half and it was superb!  Truly a TEN star soup!!!

WOWWEE!! I am addicted after just one bowl! (okay, maybe I had two or three bowls...) I had to change a few things based on what I had, but this is the best soup I have ever made!! I only used the 1 TBS canola oil, no butter. I used 1 TBS dried onion because I didn't have a fresh one. I used chicken broth because I had no veggie broth. I added a chopped gala apple with the carrots and I omitted the nutmeg. I cooked my squash in the microwave while the other stuff cooked in the pot. I had no heavy cream, but LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the soup without it. Thank you for a new lifetime favorite!!

I am a HUGE fan of butternut squash soup, and this one is amazing. I roasted two squashes in the oven before hand and followed the suggestions mentioned in earlier reviews (thanks, guys!) such as: I used FF chicken broth, added a large clove of garlic, a bay leaf while cooking, one apple (honeycrisp was what I had on hand although next time I will plan on using Granny Smith), cayenne pepper and a splash of apple juice. I wanted to pour the whole pot of it directly into my mouth... but exercised a bit of restraint.  This is easy to make and I would serve this to guests- it's that good. I highly recommend this recipe with a handful of additions!

This soup is the best I have ever tasted and easy to make. We grow our own and yes I do peel and cut up, we just like it better that way. What a keeper. The cubed squash tastes so much better when simmered with the onions and spices. I use 1 can chicken stock 14/15 oz and water to make 3 cups.

I like to follow the recipe listed before making personal changes so I tried to do that with this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use chicken stock instead of vegetable because that's what I had.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and I will definetly make it again.

Fantastic! I roasted my squash and added it to the soup when the carrots were just about tender. Left out the cream and also sauted the onion w/ cooking spray to save on fat & calories. So good..a nice delicate flavor. Not too strong which was a true joy after a few nights of spicy mexican food. :) My children enjoyed it as well (surprisingly) and my 18 month old devoured 2 bowls!

As written, I give the recipe a 3.  It needed more flavor so I added maple syrup, ginger, and apple which elevated it into 4 star.

This is awesome. Since I am knife challenged, I split the squash and scoop out the guts and cook in a 350 oven for about 30 mins per side. After the first 30 minutes I start making the soup. When the squash is done, I let it cool, then scoop into the soup and mush it all with a potato masher. I usually use half and half instead of the cream. A very good recipe.

To die for.  Made it for a dinner party, and it was so rich, elegant, and Delectable!  I tried it before and after adding the cream.  Before it was very distinct, fresh, and spicy.  After it was so incredibly creamy and decadent.  Eat it either way, this stuff is superb!

I really like this soup and I make it all the time.  Last time I added a leek along with the onion and it changed it just a bit, and I always leave out the nutmeg, not a big fan.  I make a big batch and freeze extra for later.

I used a hand held stick blender in the pot to blend...this eliminates the hot blender explosions that can occur! Also, left out the heavy cream and put a dollop of plain non-fat yogurt on top. This was delicious!

Good basic recipe!  I like my soup more flavorful so I added 1 teaspoon of yellow curry and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon plus a dash of nutmeg, salt, pepper, and sugar to taste.  Tasted like soup from a 5-star restaurant!

I stayed in Spain for a month last summer with a family that didn't speak any English. My host mother made a wonderful soup, but my Spanish wasn't good enough to catch the recipe. After searching for weeks I found it! It's wonderful served over stale bread or fried bread cubes.

The flavor of the bisque is outstanding.  I served it on Thankgiving as the appetizer with yam muffins.  I think I could stopped serving there!  My mistake was over thinning it with broth which I will correct the next 1000 times I make it.  Thin slowly to your preference.  I learned, but it was still great.  Thanks.

Wonderful! Rich tasting, healthy, simple and delicous. Have made it twice and I will make it again for company.  I don't use too much spice which really lets the squash flavor shine.  The first time it was very thick even with some cream in it.  Put it on top of grilled chicken and chesse ravioli for a pasta thats just like one I get in a good restaurant! The next time I used a 1/4 cup more stock to thin it a bit--both are great.  Hubby loved it too!

We loved this simple yet elegant soup.  I baked the squash and added it after the onion and carrot were tender. I'm planning on using this to start Thanksgiving dinner.  It would also go well with a fall meal featuring pork.

Definitely roast squash first!  I just prick mine with a fork and bake it until it is soft, then let it cool, slice it in half and scoop out seeds, then peel it.  Time will vary depending on size of squash.  You can also do this is the microwave, but it is not as easy to peel as the skin gets very soft.  I make mine vegan by substituting vegan butter, no-chicken better than bouillon, and... here's the secret.... silken tofu at the end instead of cream!  It adds protein as well as a nice creamy consistency.  I also add garlic, and sometimes a sweet potato if my squash is small.  My family LOVES this!  It's also my go-to recipe for friends that are sick.  It was the only thing that tasted good and could be kept down by a dear friend undergoing chemo.  Plus it is healthy, gluten-free, vegan, and full of great vitamins as well as protein with the added tofu!

I loved this recipe though I added a bit of a twist of my own. I used a combination of vegetable and turkey broth, added half of a pear, a little garlic, a bay leaf (removed before blending)plus a wee bit of light brown sugar. It was the best I ever made!

I loved how simple this recipe was, it's a great starter and easy to adjust to make it exactly what you want.  I followed the basic recipe, using homemade turkey stock and added what I needed of veggie stock to fill in the rest.  I skinned the squash without roasting it, and added it to the 1 full onion and carrots that were already in the pot, then after everything cooked down I added the nutmeg, coriander, white pepper, salt and a little bit of black truffle oil.  I also replaced the heavy cream with a couple Tbs of plain greek yogurt to cut back on the fat content. It turned out so well, and it's also easy to freeze so I can have a nice comfort food anytime I want.  Thanks for sharing!!

Very tasty indeed and on the nutritious side.  

Only deviations I made:

-Roasted squash first.
-Did not have heavy cream so not sure if that would have made it better than it already was.

Very good soup! I followed the directions for the most part. However I used a Lipton soup mix for the broth (that's all i had in the pantry)... and I added two tbsp of brown sugar. Other than that... I followed the recipe. I would defiantly cook the squash before hand next time, it is a pain to cube... but over all 5 stars. Great for the vegetarians in the family too!

Fantastic! Read others reviews first and added a whole sliced golden delicious apple (with the peel) with the carrots. Used two butternut squashes and probably double the carrots it called for (I was doubling and then adding more). Used chicken stock, added minced garlic, ginger and fat free half and half in place of cream. loved it. will definitely make again.

This was so delicious! I roasted the squash before, as others suggested, and used one can of chicken broth & half a can of vegetable broth. I used the heavy cream, too. I still felt like it could use something else, so I added a pinch of allspice in the end - I recommend it! The allspice pulled it all together and made the flavors pop.

this was okay, but i found the carrot overpowering. i already love the carrot ginger soup on this site, and was looking for something different. 
also -- definitely add a dollop of sour cream. brings out all the taste.

Overall a great flavor and texture, but it was missing some zing for me.  For next time, I'll probably add a bit of cayenne or red pepper to give it a bit more kick on the back of the palette, but otherwise delicious!

I've been making this for many years as the first course of Thanksgiving dinner.  I make it the day before and reheat on Thanksgiving Day, adding fat free half-n-half to give it a creamier consistency.  This has always been a big hit and is something the family looks forward to every year.

Really yummy!! I doubled this recipe to make a big pot of it (about 7-8 cups of cubed squash). I used chicken stock instead, and light cream instead of heavy cream. Do watch out for the nutmeg. I read other reviewers' comments and didn't add too much nutmeg since it's a strong flavor.

This was fabulous and everyone raved about it!  The only thing I would suggest is not to add nutmeg or seasonings until done--mine didn't need anything and it was just right.

Very easy and a tasty soup...my sister-in-law told me about COSTCO having packages or pre-cut butternut squash...I bought that, so soup was extra easy! I left out the cream, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I roasted the squash as mentioned previously and steamed the carrots, then pureed both in my food processor. Added chicken broth as opposed to vegetable stock and a little sprinkling of celery salt. Used a bit of 2% milk instead of heavy cream to keep the calorie content a little lower as well. Was a filling, delicious soup!

4 tsp kosher salt + 2 tsp ground white pepper + 1 tsp nutmeg

Excellent soup, but I wasn't sure on the amount of spices to use. I went by Alton Brown's (very similar) recipe for the spices on this, and it turned out perfect (see above)! One butternut squash yields approx 2 1/2 cup scooped. I roasted mine at 400 deg for about an hour or so with a bit of water in the bottom of the pan, skin side down/flesh up. I brushed with melted butter and sprinkled on kosher salt and white pepper before roasting.

Awesome! I added a clove of garlic and roasted the squash as other reviewers suggested. I also used a little fat-free half and half instead of the heavy cream before serving. It tasted great! We will definitely be keeping this recipe and making it again!

I use 3 carrots to one butternut squash, 2 qts. of chicken, not vegetable, stock and a full cup (or more to taste) of cream.  I also use white pepper, not black - it gives great taste without showing.  My family absolutely goes crazy for this soup and I make it every Thanksgiving!

Wonderful recipe that's easy to follow and can be spiced as much or as little as you like.  I followed it exactly and added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl as it was served.  This was a hit!

I added a red apple (I'm not sure what type) and extra nutmeg and I added cinnamon. Some people loved it and some people hated it.. Cut back on the spices if some people don't like it too much. I also had no heavy cream on hand so I used whole milk and butter. It didn't compare. Iwould recommend using the heavy cream.

I am a little baffled by the awesome reviews of this bisque.  It was incredibly bland.  I offered a toppings bar to my family but it had so little flavor that no one really enjoyed it.

Very enjoyable, very fall. But also, very oniony. I would cut back on the onion by half. I also added a peeled/diced Braeburn apple when I added the carrots (wish I had added 2), and I roasted the squash for 30 minutes before adding it. Needs a generous sprinkle of nutmeg per bowl as well as mixed in while cooking.

This soup is AMAZING! We do nto add cream and still get the desired thickness/creaminess. I only use 3-4 cups chicken broth along with 3-4 large carrots and 1/2 onion. It's so good and we make this all Fall/Winter and with it being so low fat it's perfect! Toddler loves it too!

Delicious! With recommendations from other reviewers, I also roasted my squash beforehand. I also added some cinnamon and roasted ginger, along with the nutmeg. And, I don't usually have cream around the house, so instead I substituted 1/2 cup of vanilla ice cream. Yum, I will definitely make this again!

Really good!  I liked the addition of carrots-done this type of soup before but never with carrots.  I roasted the squash first(you can use any similar flavored squashed, I had a random winter squash laying around).  I sauteed the onion with garlic and the carrots first. Put them in with the squash and used my immersion blender the mush it all up.  I used 4 cups vegetable stock and olive oil instead of canola.  Lots of garlic powder, onion powder in addition to the other seasoning.  The cream really puts the soup outta this world.  Really good the days after too.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe...Although it takes a little longer I use a potato peeler to skin the squash, then cube it, seeds are easy to remove this way. I use 3 cloves of garlic - diced in place of the onion and olive oil instead of canola oil. I like to boil, then simmer the squash as directed because it seems to soak up all the flavors (and smells so wonderful)! It is a weekend thing for me due to the time it takes, but so worth it!

A nice soup for a cold winter day (or anytime for that matter)!  I'm rating four stars simply because it was a bit sweeter than I wanted.  It wasn't overly sweet but if you're looking for a more savory soup, cut back on the carrots (use 1/2 cup), throw in a few cloves of garlic and use 1 cup of chicken stock with 2 cups of vegetable stock.  Though if a mildly sweet soup is what you're after, you can't go wrong making the original recipe!

mmmm delish!  i did take the suggestions from a few reviewers  Roasted the squash made it much easier, and i also added garlic, onion powder, and a bay leaf.  and instead of heavy cream i added some low fat cream cheese.  It didn't need much of that anyways. delish all on it's own!  Super easy as well!  Thank you for the recipe

I omitted brown sugar as other said.  I did NOT use a food processor though.  I let it simmer several hours & used a potato masher.  Also, I microwave my squash for 15 minutes.  I think baking bakes the flavor out

This was so easy and AMAZING.   I did pre roast my squash and I only used about 1/4 cup of cream.   I just added a pinch of nutmeg to the soup and added it at serving instead.

Excellent!! I followed reviewers suggestions,  *used low sodium chicken broth for more flavor *used fennel (couldn't find leeks, can you imagine?) *apples (2 granny smith) *sweet potatoes instead of carrots  roasted the veggies, like one reviewer said it did not take that long either, the smells in my kitchen were fantastic and my 8 yr. old daughter said, it smells just like Thanksgiving in here. So instead of squash and brown sugar and mashed potatoes, we have a a new tradition. Thank you so much PHONELADY 55. Yum

I think it is fabulous. I love garlic and coriander, so I added both. I used a potato peeler on the squash, and cubed it. Wasn't that hard to do. I should have added an apple like other did, maybe next time. It was delicious. I used 1/2 and 1/2. I also used chicken stock. It was really good.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. Even those who thought they didn'r like squash look forward to it! I serve it with a little cream and bacon in each bowl (I cook the bacon until it's nice and crunchy and use scissors to cut it up in little pieces once it has cooled down)

I loved it. I added a tsp or so of curry paste (I can't get enough of it) and it was great. I didn't have onions available so I did not add any, but I did add garlic. I would definitely make again!

This soup is a great base to start with. I gave it 4 stars b/c I did modify it quite a lot. Like a lot of ppl here, I did roast the squash first in 1 inch of water @ 350 for ~30 minutes.  I also added 1 clove garlic (could maybe use 2), 1/2 granny smith apple, bay leaf and a dash of cayenne.  I used an immersion blender and it worked great (though I accidentally blended my bay leaf. Didn't seem to do anything tho!). Also I added half and half instead of cream, and probably less than 1/2 c. Though, it would have been great without any cream too! I did end up roasting the squash seeds with some Cajun seasoning and added some as a garnish/side and it was great!

Very good bisque. I made it almost as directed, but did use a whole golden delicious apple (diced and heated w/ butter, onion and 2 cloves of garlic in the sauce pan and 4 cups of vegetable broth). I did forget to add carrots, however, but it was wonderful. I think it may need a touch of cayenne pepper or maybe curry seasoning, but my husband and I did enjoy it. Thanks for sharing!

Like most others, I also roasted the squash first.  I also added a finely diced hot chili pepper for a nice warm kick.  Counting WW points, so no butter or cream.  Just used the canola for sauteing and low-fat milk stirred in at the end.  So filling - mine was close to 6 servings.  Made some yummy homemade rye bread for dipping.  Perfect for this cooler weather.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic basic recipie that needs very little tweeking.  I would go with what other reviwers suggested here.   I bought two medium butternut squash and cut them in half.  I cooked the half in the microwave about 10 mins per 2 halves.  This allows the filling to scoop out.   You can do this while you sautee the onion and boil the carrot.  I added a little garlic and crushed red pepper to my mix as I enjoy those flavors.  After I did the puree my bisque was a little thicker than I care for so I gradualy added broth until it was the desired thickness.  The cream is essential in my book!

This is a very good recipe. I was looking for a basic butternut squash soup and this was perfect. I made only minor changes. I am not a fan of nutmeg, so I omitted it, and instead of heavy cream, I used low fat sour cream.

So delicious. I knew when I cut open the large squash and it was a beautiful vibrant orange that it would be good. I roasted the squash for about 45 minutes. I hardly had any onion, less than 1/4 cup and cut up 3 carrots which actually was like 1 1/4 cup, probably making mine sweeter, but it came out super delicious.

This is by far the best butternut squash bisque I have ever had! I doubled the recipe and substituted apples for onions because I didn't have any.  We used some fat free half and half in place of the cream and it was awesome!

This is one of my favorite recipes for the Fall.  Delicious!  I would highly recommend microwaving the squash and carrots to get them tender.  All you do is cut the squash in half (remove the seeds) and put facedown in a microwavable container with about 1/2 inch of water.  Cover and microwave 12 to 15 minutes. You can cook the carrots at the same time. Then you just scoop out the squash from the peel and put it in the blender.  This makes preparation a lot easier since you don't have to cube up the squash.

This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever tasted!! It was a huge hit at my family's Thanksgiving dinner last year and I am making it again this year!

I bake the squash first- I prefer to peel it and cut it into chunks before baking, because although peeling it is hard, I get more out of the squash- when I cut it in half and bake it, I find it really hard to get all the squash out of the peel. I sprinkle some olive oil on it before baking. I also use half-and-half instead of heavy cream.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

I baked the butternut squash in the oven then peeled & cubed it.  I was trying to replicate a soup we had in a restaurant so I cut the amount of onion by half & increased the carrots by 1/4 cup.  I was generous with the nutmeg, eliminated the pepper & added some ground cinnamon.  Instead of heavy cream, I used reduced-fat half & half. The family loved it.

Wonderful recipe!  Especially with all the member's suggestions.... I doubled it, and like many others roasted the squash first, added garlic, apple and additional spices--cinnamon and cayenne.  (will probably try a bit of curry powder next time.)  I also tried the splash of orange juice and loved it!

This soup was very good! I didn't have any vegetable stock, so I used some potato liquid that I found in the freezer, as well as one chicken bullion cube. I used only the olive oil, and also skipped the cream. The soup was very good; I will make it again! Thanks!

This soup is a real keeper. Great for a winter meal. I roasted the squash in the oven for about 1 hour at 350, omited the oil, added lots of garlic, used chicken stock (it's what I had on hand) and substituted the cream with condensed skim milk. Served with sour cream. Suprisingly satisfing and a beautiful shade or orange!

This is wonderful! I needed to use a butternut squash that someone gave me, I hated to let it go bad.  When this recipe came up I decided to try it and wow was it great.  I did not have any cream but I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and used a little whip cream.  It looked great and it added just a hint of sweetness complimenting the bisque very well.  Also, I added some hot pepper flakes to spice things up a bit.  I definately will be buying myself a butternut squash once in awhile to make it again!

This was a really good recipie. We didn't know that butternut squash was so good! Also, my husband (who likes helping in the kitchen as long as it involves using knives and / or chopping) had no problems using a potato peeler on the squash. This was a quick, easy and delicious recipie.

Love the use of "bisque" it just sounds so fantastic with the reiterated Bs ! Loved the soup, too! I also added an apple, and a leek, and used Garam Masala spice blend instead of nutmeg, and just a hint of Chipotle. Guests raved about it for days! served toasted pumpkin seeds to sprinkle on top.

This soup was super easy to make, and it tastes great.  I left out the nutmeg and it was still great.  I used 1/2 cup of half & half cream at the end.  I roasted my squash first as per recommendations and having done that first made this recipe very quick to make.

Roast the vegetables first to caramelize and bring out the most flavor - plus it's easier than trying to peel and cube an uncooked squash. Other than that, nothing in this recipe needs adjusting, save for seasoning to taste, naturally! Really smooth and flavorful. To my mind, the cream isn't optional though - it's a must-add that takes the soup to the next level.

This is such a flavorful yet simple soup. I roasted the cubed squash (450 for 40 min) with a touch of olive oil and some rosemary and thyme, and it gave the soup a delicious caramelized flavor. I subbed coconut oil for butter. I didn't use any cream, and I didn't feel the soup was lacking at all. I can't wait to make this again.

This was really good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I changed the recipe quite a bit. I omitted the butter. After I pureed the soup I thought it was a bit too sweet for me so I added some curry and ginger and a bit more salt. I also left out the cream - it was sooo yummy!

So delicious, and not at all difficult, especially if you buy pre-peeled squash. I would definitely recommend using the optional cream. It's not a lot, but it really adds to the soup. For an elegant start to dinner, add some chopped fresh sage with the onion (you only need 2 tsp or so, sage is powerful). Then top the soup with sizzled sage leaves (fry whole, washed and well dried sage leaves in some olive oil until they turn dark and are crisp). Takes it over the top.

Pretty good, but needs a little something more for the flavor.  Just a touch bland.  We really prefer pumpkin soups to squash, so far...

Haven't served it yet but I've tasted enough.. This is my first time making anything with squash, but it was very easy. I did as previous people recommended and cooked the squash halves while I sauteed onions, carrots, apple, and garlic. Once cooked, the squash was easy to scrape from the skin and its softness made blending even easier. It's simmering now (smells great!), and I've added cinnamon, more nutmeg, and paprika. I tried a small amount with curry powder, but I may skip that tonight. 

I don't think my fiancee will like the pureed texture, so I may add noodles or gnocchi. I'm definately keeping this one in my recipe box!

I made some changes to the recipe and it was great! I took others suggestions such as cooking the squash first. Slice the butternut squash in half, scoop out the seeds and roast it face down in a pan with ½ cup water at 350 for about 40 minutes. Scoop out the squash. I found that scooping out the squash with an ice cream scoop worked great.

I used less carrots (1/2 cup) and sliced them instead of diced them. I used fresh chicken stock by boiling two chicken breasts and let the stock cool overnight in frig and skimmed off the fat. I omitted the nutmeg (husband hates it) and used half and half instead of heavy cream. We felt it really needed half and half. We sprinkled each soup dish serving with parmesan cheese which was delicious!

I copied what IMVINTAGE did by roasting the squash first and adding an apple to the mix. Also used chicken stock instead of vegetable and a dollop of sour cream in each bowl of soup instead of the heavy cream. The result was very tasty. Next time I would add a little less stock as I like my soup a bit thicker.

This is a very simple and quick recipe to make.  I make it and freeze quick easy to grab portions so whenever I want some soup for lunch, I always have a great choice in the freezer.  I did add navy beans as a source of protein and added 1% milk instead of cream but otherwise followed the recipe as stated and it turned out great.  I make this recipe 3-4 times a year.  Definitely a staple item in my freezer! Thanks for sharing.

Squash was super hard to "peel."  Soup was GREAT, even a picky husband loved it.  Didn't use any cream at all.

Great recipe.  I followed other's advice and cooked the squash in the oven while chopping the onions and carrots.  I thought it was very rice and didn't need any 1/2 and 1/2.

Wasn't sure if the squash was suppose to go in cooked or raw and was short on time so I cut the squash in half, scooped the insides, covered with plastic wrap and microwaved for 10 minutes. Followed the recipe (used chicken stock instead) but just boiled it and didn't simmer. Had the whole thing done along with side of zucchini couscous and cream cheese pitas within a half hour. Tasted great. My husband had seconds and put the remainder of the couscous in - he liked it better since it calmed down the richness of it.

I LOVE this recipe.  If you do not add the cream, it is a very healthful way to get a serving of vegetable.  Sometimes, I make it just as the recipe states and other times, I leave out the nutmeg and add a spoonful of curry paste for a spicy, exotic version.  One of my favorites!

Rich. Velvety. When I saw the weather outside today I had to have butternut soup. I substituted the cream with 'Silk' creamer and yogurt butter. It is such a forgiving recipe and tastes perfect with many different adjustments. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I did all the prep the night before (cut all the veggies and put them in seperate baggies portioned out) and that made it much easier on Thanksgiving.  I wonder if this freezes well otherwise I won't make it again (not everyone liked it enough).

This soup is great.  I didn't have vegetable stock (or chicken stock) on hand, so I just used water, more onion, and a whole celery stock.  Remove the celery before pureeing.  Instead of heavy cream, I used a 14. oz can of fat free evaporated milk.  If you use a blender to puree the soup, pour the soup back in the pot, and then before rinsing the blender, pour the milk in and froth it first.  I also added a dash of ginger to the nutmeg.  Served this hot with grated parmesan on top this soup is simply wonderful!

Made this for xmas dinner and was fine.  I'd rate it 3.5 stars, which means I'd make it again, its in my files, but it is not a dish I think everyone will request next year.  However, most guests said it was a nice dish that many had not had before.

It is a heavy, filling, colorful soup.  Expect to serve cups or in small bowls.  Too heavy for a big bowl before a big meal.

To peel squash, get a SHARP knife and cut across into cylinders.  Takes some muscle and a SHARP knife.  Then simply trim off the outside rolling it along the board with the knife held toward the board into the flesh.  Expect to need 2.5 squash.

Everyone loved the color, and a few had extra.  One person asked for recipe.  The celery/leek soup I made for new years was a much bigger hit.

This soup freezes well.  I toasted the seeds to sprinkle on top but didn't care for them (tough).  Instead just throw in a dash of nutmeg on top of each cup just before serving.

This was  a delicious soup for a cold fall night!.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and made the following changes; baked the squash first, used a sweet onion, chicken stock, added curry powder while sauteing the onions, and added cinnamon and allspice.  I also added two drops of orange oil and that really perked up the flavor.  Will definately make again!!

The soup was Ok, but I felt that it was lacking something, even after I added some extra spice.  A little bit of curry powder seemed to help, and it was definetly edible, but I think I will try to find a better one for next time.

This has a good squash flavor and since my squash yielded more than 4 cups, I think I added about 5 or so cups and it came out plenty thick.  I agree with some of the other reviewers about adding some spice to kick the flavor up a notch.  Serve with a crusty bread and a good salad for a yummy meatless fall meal.  I only gave it 3 stars because I think it needs some extra flavor, marjoram, curry, allspice or something, I wasn't wild about the nutmeg.

I loved this!  I cooked it last night for two experienced cooks--my mom and her friend, who came to visit.  I'm a good cook, and I love food, but I'm not very experienced.  This was excellent and they both asked for the recipe.  The only thing I would suggest, if you want a thicker, chunkier soup, is to not completely puree the vegetables.  I thought the soup was a little thin, but the taste was perfect.  Next time I'm going to add rutabags, and perhaps someday potatoes.  And serve with warm crusty bread.  Fantastique!

This soup was outstandingly delicious! i'm not so much of a soup person but love squash so i thought that i'd give it a go and am so happy i did. few notes, i made a quadruple batch and as one user suggested, used leeks instead of onion. i also added 3tbsp light cream cheese while i was blending the soup instead of cream... made it very silky and rich!!! thanks for such a fantastic recipe!

This is a simple & excellent soup recipe.  The only changes I made we're using leeks (white parts only) instead of the onion.  I added a pinch of cinnamon & allspice as well.  Definately add the cream!  Thanks PhoneLady......

My Chinese relatives LOVED this dish!  They couldn't stop asking me what's in this soup.  They never even heard of butternut squash before and was very curious about it, usually they're not with foods.  I love the way the vegetable broth adds a tang to the soup (I thought the cream was spoiled but realized it's the broth)  Delicious!  I will have to substitute non-dairy creamy for heavy cream next time for health reasons.  Thanks sooo much Phonelady!

This soup is totally fabulous.  It is comforting and filling and even tastier the next day.  I'm making a huge batch to freeze for winter dinners.  try adding a dash of cayenne or curry powderfor some more depth of flavor.

A permanent addition to my kitchen, I made it for my mom, cause she is the only other person who likes Butternut Squash soup.  Now she requests it every weekend.  I should just make a GIGANTIC pot of it and freeze in portions.

This was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly, except:  I added a clove of garlic to the onion, I added a 1/8 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper, and I cut the heavy cream in 1/2.  The nutmeg was "to taste" so I added a 1/8 teaspoon of that as well.  Wonderful!!  I think next time I can cut the cream even more (just to be healthier).  Tip:  Shoprite has the butternut squash already peeled and cubed....SO much easier!

Oh my, this was amazing!  I added 2 cloves minced garlic with the onion and sauteed in butter and coconut oil. I then added 2 stalks diced celery and 1 peeled and diced golden delicious apple to the veggies.  I crushed some dried rosemary (about 1-1/2 tsp) in a mortar and pestle and just put in a dash or two of nutmeg.  A little bit goes a long way!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I only have one more recipe that I like more, because it has an apple added to it giving it a slightly sweet bite. It was so quick and easy to make though. All of the ingredients fit into a pot I have with 3" sides. I used 2 (12oz) packages of peeled and cubed butternut squash I bought from Trader Joes. When I measured both bags, together, they pretty much equaled the 4 cups. I have no patience to peel and cube a fresh squash. I used no-salt vegetable broth cubes. Once I added the broth, I cooked the vegetables for 15 minutes on medium high or approximately 7 on my stove. Then I turned off the heat and let it sit 5 more on that burner. I ladled it into the blender and processed about 30 seconds on speed 10 and then about 2 minutes on high. I tasted it and decided to add garlic salt, to taste, or about 1/2 tsp., and a dash extra of black pepper. I didn't add the optional heavy cream and it did not need it. I recalculated the calories without it and it came to 182.5 per serving. Thank you!

Didn't change much in this.  I always have squash roasted and frozen from fall harvesting, so I simple use what I have stored in the deep freeze.  It makes making this so lightening fast.  I use vegetable Better Than Bouillon for the broth.  It has such a nice flavor in soups.  I do use 1/2 and 1/2 to save a few calories:)  We really enjoy this soup, and don't find it bland at all.  I even forget the nutmeg all the time.  Oh! well never missed.

It was a good start, but it definitely needed something.  I added mushrooms and a jalapeno.  Perhaps the original recipe is based on a really flavorful veggie broth that didn't require much else.

I loved this soup! I am on Weight Watchers and could not believe the nutrition facts about this soup.  I modified the recipe by making my own vegetable stock (no salt).  That is the only modification I made and according to WW, the soup is 8 pts TOTAL, for the entire batch! I even added regular half and half.  The homemade stock and pre-roasting the squash before hand was key.  I did add a dash of sea salt to my bowl at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe similar to my moms, but this was just too thick.  We like our soups a little more soupy.  Had good flavor, but just not our taste.  Im sure its awesome to many others though!  If you lke much more thicker soup, then this one will be good.

This was such an easy and delicious dish.  I added yellow bell pepper to the mix too.  Turned out great!  

In the future, I will use less broth because I like a thicker 'bisque'. Other than that, I won't change a thing.

A bit modified, but delicious!  I didn't have nutmeg, so I put in a dash of cloves and ginger.  And I didn't have cream, so I used 8 oz of cream cheese instead.  Oh, and chicken broth instead of vegetable.  It was very smooth and decadent.

I took the advice and pre-roasted the squash which really helped. I also added a 1/2 cup of organic cauliflower that I had and a bit of white truffle sea salt to jazz things up a little more. I paired it with some warm herbed flat bread and this was incredible. My boyfriend and I ate all of it within 24 hours and now that I've gone back to my weekly farmers market for more delicious butternut squash I shall make some more! SO. GOOD.

I bought the squash already cut saved sometime especially for this being my first time ever dealing with squash. It's a bit sweet but to even it out added some crushed pepper to make it tasty! Overall it turned out delicious! You can do without the cream if wanted.

Delicious!  I skipped the cream, and went lighter on the nutmeg.  I also used precut squash to cut back on time.  Wonderful!

Very easy to make and definitely a whole food.  My 17-year old step-son loves this so I can get an orange vegetable in him easily.  This can cook while you prepare all your other things so I highly recommend this as easy, nutritious and very simple.  A stick blender is a much more simple way to get all ingredients mixed in.

This is a DELICIOUS soup!! Definitely follow the instructions found in previous reviews for the squash, and add your own spices to the recipe as, the soup as written is a tad bland.

I made this in advance of the Thanksgiving dinner and found it to be bland.  Having looked at some of the newer recipes on this soup, I took 1 cup of the "broth" before pureeing and cooked a diced Granny Smith in the microwave.  I added to the soup pureed and it was wonderful.

I LOVE butternut squash soup and this is the best recipe I have found on here! I didn't follow the measurements very carefully, and also roasted the squash first but it still came out great. I will use this again for sure!

Delicious! I too roasted the squash before I cooked it. I also added some cinnamon along with the nutmeg.  This was so yummy and easy to make. I'll definitely be using this recipe all the time.

Really yummy. I used homemade veg broth and just eyeballed amounts and it worked out great. Slammed it with pepper and extra fresh ground nutmeg to serve cuz they add a nice bite (my family loves pepper and some of my family doesn't like sour cream.) Could also use hot sauce or chipotle because they'll pair with the sweet quite well. I used a very high quality sour cream because why bother with the fat and calories unless it's worth it, right? I think it's important to use whole sour cream because the textural component completes the "mouth feel" for lack of a better phrase. Of course, whole greek yogurt will likely do very well also. Definitely very easy and you can impress guests with it also, while being somewhat healthy and given I have one vegetarian in the house, I don't have to make two meals. Served with bacon avocado sandwiches for the carnivores and a facon (Smart Bacon) avocado sandwich for the vegetarian.

I bought cubed butternut squash from the supermarket and nuked them for a few minutes and used EVOO instead of canola oil.  I also sauteed the carrots first to soften them before throwing in the butternut squash.  I think this recipe is good but my husband loved it.  Something tasted a little off to me and I realized it was the nutmeg.  I added skim milk and some cayenne pepper at the end which boosted the flavor.  I wish I had taken people's advice and skipped the nutmeg altogether.

5***** I added 1/2 a honey crisp apple & topped off our bowls with hot sauce - I used Cholula & my husband, Sri Racha. I also sauteed some garlic & ginger in with the onion, butter & oil. This is the 1st review I have ever written - I just had to write because it turned out so well. Definitely delicious & fancy enough to serve for company & super simple. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious soup.   Caramelized the onions as I had to for another recipe, and added just a touch of the nutmeg.  The soup is super smooth and has become a keeper.

Cook your squash first. I cut it in half, scooped out the seeds/stringy stuff, put it in a glass dish and covered it, then microwaved on high for 12-15 minutes. Since I did this, I should have waited until the carrots were soft before I added the squash - next time!

I wanted to make an inviting autumn soup for friends and family, and tried this recipe.  The onions and garlic were so fragrant...I used unsalted butter but substituted evaporated milk for the optional cream...The squash was simply boiled in water then pureed in the blender.  The soup came out comforting, mild, sweet, aromatic, but slightly too bland for my S.O. who loves savory and bold flavors.  I loved the soup and will make again--perhaps I'll try roasting the squash and adding more seasoning. This is a good basic recipe that you can expand on!

This soup is delicious and perfect for a fall day.  Another great addition to each bowl is a few shakes of cayenne pepper, I like a little spice in my dishes and that was the perfect ingredient!  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written!

I've tried many recipes on this website, most of which were rated five stars by the majority, only to be let down. Well, I have to say that this recipe is without a doubt a bonafide five stars! My absolute favorite on this website so far. My husband and I can't get enough of it so I've had to quadruple the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing a five star worthy recipe.

I had to make some changes due to not having everything in stock in my kitchen, but I think this would be great even as written! I used Olive oil and Smart Balance margarine instead of canola and butter; I didn't have squash, so I subbed 4 cups pumpkin puree that I had frozen from pumpkin pie season; instead of vegetable stock, I used 3 cups water with 3 beef bouillon cubes;  I sauteed 1/2 a bag of matchstick carrots with the onion; and instead of cream, I used a few splashes of skim milk and a large spoonful of light sour cream. This was really good except that I couldn't get it completely smooth. It was still grainy, but delicious. I should invest in a sieve....

4 stars as written...I added a peeled, diced apple and some garlic, plus at the end I still had to sweeten it a bit with some stevia (about the equivalent of 4 teaspoons).  I added the cream, plus I had about a 1/2 cup of buttermilk leftover from Thanksgiving, so I added that at the very end.  Yummy!

I only gave this 4 stars because it was very salty when made as is. I doubled the recipes. I roasted the squash and carrots (sprinkled butter and cin. sugar on the carrots and wrapped in tinfoil). After sampling final product, I sauteed 2 gala apples and pureed them into it. Still salty. I then added about 4-6 tbsp. of maple syrup. Plus about 2 tbsp of cream sherry. I also added about 1 tbsp of cinnamon. It was very good after this and got rave reviews at my dinner party.

This was the yummiest soup I have ever made! I love all things pumpkin and this was no exception. I made it true to the recipe, except I used Japanese pumpkin instead of butternut squash because they are sweeter and also thicker in texture. Tasted SO good with a little bit of heavy cream added to the bowl. Yum!

everyone who said to roast it before is wrong.  I did it exactly as it was writen and it was great.  I added some ground ginger after trying it but that was it and it was so easy!

Excellent recipe! Costco sells already cubed butternut squash which makes prep much faster and safer.

A slight variation from the butternut squash soup that I usually make but every bit as good. For those who thought it was a little bland, perhaps you didn't add enough nutmeg. Freshly ground nutmeg greatly enhances the flavour of dishes with cream and also many cheese dishes. Also, microwaving the squash is faster but you get a much better flavour if it's roasted in the oven. Before putting the squash in the oven I brush with a little butter and sprinkle it with nutmeg. Becuase of this, I don't usually add oil to the bisque but I do add more nutmeg.

Outstanding soup! Roast the squash, add a granny smith apple, cinnamon, skip the cream (you don't need it), season to taste, and definitely use the emersion blender. Everyone will love it!

Very good. I roasted my butternut squash in the oven as suggested by others. Sprinkled a little nutmeg on the top of the soup in each bowl. Easy and delicious.

Amazing! I had tons of butternut squash in my garden. My husband isn't a huge fan of butternut squash, but he said he would like it if I made it into a soup. This soup is so good and so easy to make. I've never cooked with butternut squash, so I wasn't sure how to cook it. I did as other reviewers said: sliced it in half, placed it in a pan with a little water, covered with foil and cooked in the oven for about 30 minutes. I halfed the recipe, so 1 butternut squash was perfect.

This was my first time ever making/eating Butternut Squash.  I found the bisque to be a tiny bit bland and will add nutmeg or cinnamon next time. Thanks to the other reviewers for the tip on microwaving the squash beforehand.

I actually used banana squash to make this.  I roasted the squash to avoid the difficult peeling and cubing of it raw, used more carrot than called for (2 large carrots),  used water instead of stock, and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I was worried that it wouldn't taste very good with just water but it was very tasty.  I tasted it without the cream and it is good that way, but the cream does add to it.  I sprinkled the nutmeg on each bowl, along with a little cinnamon.   I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. :)  I am sure I will be making this recipe often and sharing it with others.

I followed the directions the first time after that I peeled the squash added one onion and one apple I had on hand and my own chicken broth from the freezer and put it all in a large pot. Strained and put it in my blender with a little of the broth at a time and returned to pan. Added only a little nutmeg in each bowl and the family all asked for the recipe. Loved it and what a healthy dish for my family.

Wow - is this ever good! I followed other readers suggestion and microwaved the squash halves for 10 minutes. Worked like a charm. I used fat free half and half and it was delicious. I am convinced that you could garnish with a little cheese and serve this to children as cheese soup. They would gobble it up. Fabulous recipe!

Absolutely wonderful!  I'll echo previous reviewers regarding roasting the squash first; I cut and peeled it raw, and it was very difficult!  Also, yes, go easy on the nutmeg; a little goes a lot further than you'd imagine!

Loved it!  I don't really like onion so I left it out and didn't have any nutmeg, but it tasted wonderful without those ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that. All you need is a bowl of this and some French bread for a great meal!

This recipe is worth the task of cutting up the squash! I finally realized I had not been cooking the squash long enough and the soup had a funky texture. This time I baked the squash for 40 minutes face down in water at 375 degrees. I cooked the heck out of the carrots and squash and the soup pureed into a thick cream. I'm not a huge fan of nutmeg so I started with 1/2 teaspoon and added to taste from there. Next time I'll add cinnamon and try microwaving the squash for 10 minutes. The recipe was much better before I added the cream- doesnt need it.

I had a few hours this afternoon and decided to make this festive early fall dish with the abundance of butternut squash coming out of our garden.  I baked the squash like everyone had suggested and am so glad that I did.  It was much easier to scoop out and add in later. I didn't have vegetable stock on hand so ended up using chicken broth, 33 percent less sodium, and followed the recipe from there.  I didn't add the cream because I like bisque without it.  I also really enjoy nutmeg so I added a lot to my separate bowl.  An overall great fall recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This is a fantastic soup!  I'm not a fan of cutting up a whole squash, so I found fresh, peeled and cubed butternut squash in the produce section at the store.  It's more expensive than buying a whole squash, but it's so much easier.  I roasted the squash in the oven before adding it to the soup.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, since that was what I had on hand.  It was so nice and creamy.  I can't wait to make this again when the weather turns cooler.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Very good. I took the advice of others and I put some garlic in with the onions.  I put a green apple and a bay leaf in with the carrots as well.  I also roasted the butternut squach and so didn't add it until the carrots were done.  I like some heat so I added a bit cayenne.

This bisque is devine! I made this 5 times so far and plan to make it again this Friday! I made a couple modifications as others suggested: I split + roasted the squash on 350 for about 50 min to get the flesh soft and also added 1 golden apple. The last time I made it I forgot to add the cream but it didn't matter, it was just as good without it! Oh, and the second time I made the soup I used precut squash from Costco (as someone suggested). That was a bad idea! The precut squash lost the majority of its flavor which made my soup bland.

I love this recipe. One change I made was to use turkey stock from our holiday turkey in place of vegetable stock. The bisque has a lovely sweetness from the squash. I roasted the squash first to concentrate the flavors and ease the peeling process. Having an immersion blender really pays off for this recipe. I added a bit of fresh thyme towards the end. It really has a wonderful texture, beautiful color, and memorable flavors. It's too good to save for only guests.

Excellent. My kids loved it and didn't realize they were eating squash. Although, it was a little thick. Next time I'll try to thin it a bit.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I didn't have veggie stock so I used chicken stock instead. Also, we like our butternut squash soup a little sweeter so I added about 3/4 cup of Splenda after I pureed in the food processor.  It was delicious!

This was wonderful and easy to make. I had never eaten butternut squash before and was looking for new vegetarian recipes. This one was a winner! Thank you

What an easy, cheap and delicous meal! 

Taking advice from other reviewers, I roasted my squash, I used 1/2 a bag of frozen carrots (that is all I had) and cooked those with the onion. I also used chicken broth and 1/2 a package of Fat Free Cream cheese. It was delicious - very creamy (used the food processor before I put the cream cheese in). Yummy. My 2 1/2 year old ate some too.

I've tried 3 butternut soups this fall.  This is the best one.  I used fat free half and half in place of the regular cream (i'm a lifetime weight watcher member).  I added some curry (just a sprinkle) and some cayenne to give it a zip.  Fresh grated nutmeg adds a nice touch too.  Great recipe.

I really hate all kinds of squash, but a butternut came in my CSA box, so I made this soup.  I thought it was great!  First time I've ever liked anything with squash in it!  I did roast the squash first.

So yummy!  I kept the recipe mostly the same, but added 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onion and 1 peeled, cored, and sliced green apple when I added the stock.  Also, I cooked the squash in the microwave (sliced in half, cut side down, covered with plastic wrap, 10 min), before adding to the pot.  I only added a splash of low fat whipping cream and it was perfect.  I used 1 large squash, 1/2 of a large onion, 3 carrots, and 2 cans of veg stock.  I omitted the nutmeg (personal taste).

Excellent. I buy organic diced butternut squash (easy!). I add celery and use low-fat milk and low-sodium vegetable bullion. Garnish with sliced green onions. I find that a hand "immersion" blender is the only way to make this soup without making a mess.

This is the best soup I have ever made! I made it just as written and I was ecstatic.  Don't be afraid of the nutmeg, it really does something special. There's a sweet and salty thing going on here, so much so that one of the eaters asked if there was any sugar in. Oh man, cannot say enough good things. So simple, so fast. Perfect recipe for a nice small squash.

I love this bisque (and so did my guests), and it is reasonably healthy!  I did not change any of the ingredients.  However, with regard to the cooking time, I followed the instructions, but when the soup was on the watery side, I let it cool, and then reheated it for 15 - 20 minutes.  This re-cooking really brought the bisque to the right consistency.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I barely modified it, only adding a 1/2 c of apple cider.  It made a TON of bisque!  So much that I had to puree it in two big batches because it wouldn't all fit in the blender.  

My husband made it a second time and had issues with the blender bursting open with hot bisque flying out, but he did not use the pulse option and whipped the hot liquid in one fell swoop.  This kept all the steam bottled in- not a good idea.

Really tasty- thanks!

This is a great recipe. Adding in some Cayenne and Jamaican Curry instead of the nutmeg was the way to go (Butternut Squash is already sweet enough for us).

Very easy to make...especially if you're a champ at chopping vegetables. Served this for dinner guests and they ate more of this soup than the main course! Haven't tried any of the suggested variations, but will definitely make again and experiment.

Simply wonderful flavors...  I liked it before and I added the heavy cream and also after.  Couldn't have been more pleased with the results.  Used two shallots (love them) with the onion but that's all I added.

Thanks...

I have been looking for a great butternut squash soup and I finally found it!  I didn't use any oil and used half the butter.  My husband wanted it a little bit sweeter so he added some sugar.  I thought it was great just the way it was.  I ate the leftovers the next three nights in a row.  : )

This is a wonderfully easy recipe!  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I halved the squash and baked it in a 375 degree oven for 1 hour before peeling.  I think it added a nice roasted flavor, too.  I didn't have carrots on hand, so I just left that out, and the soup seemed to have plenty of flavor.  Also, I used an immersion blender to blend the soup -but be very careful if you do this with a hot liquid!  It was much faster than getting out the old blender.

Aussies love their "pumpkin soups".  This recipe was #1 with my Aussie husband tonight!  I had to use chicken stock because I ran out of vegetable stock.  And I followed everyone else's advice of roasting my squash in the oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes to softened it.  While I added a few splashes of Tabasco to my steaming mug of bisque, my husband prefered his just like the recipe called for.  I have a feeling this one will be going in the regular rotation in our house!  Perfect for a freezing winter night!

Like everyone else, I added more spices to this soup: allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cumin.  I also baked it the squash beforehand, to make it softer.  Turned out fabulously.

This came out so creamy and smooth! I also added a few sticks of carrots for added color. I didn't have the vegetable stock, so I created my own! Just boiled some water, added fresh cilantro, parseley and some dashes of black pepper and salt to taste! It was added to the rest, and it was soooo divine! My hubby raved!! simply wonderful! :)

Very good.  I sliced the butternut squash in half, scooped out the seeds, and roasted it face down in a pan with 1/2 of water at 350 for 40 minutes.  I also added a dash of cinnamon.

I used some fresh thyme rather than nutmeg, which gave it a more savory flavor and nicely balanced the sweetness.  The advice to microwave the squash was great.  It peeled easily and cooked quickly.

I really didn't like this, but my husband did so I'm giving it a 3.  To be fair, I think I used too much nutmeg.  It's not an easy spice to use "to taste".  I suppose you should go light with it because you can always add more if you need it!  I did cut the squash in half and microwave in a dish with a bit of water for 10 minutes to soften it up, which made it easier to peel.  I also mashed it with a potato masher rather than blending it.  I wanted it a little thicker.  So those things were good and hopefully will be useful to someone!

Okay, I just made this for lunch- WOW!  I had some leftover butternut squash  and found this recipe.  Really excellent, delicate flavor.  My only changes were fat-free half and half instead of cream, and a pinch of cinnamon.  DELISH!

I made this bisque with squash and carrots from my garden. My husband raved about it! I cooked the squash in the microwave to soften and make it easier to peel. I also substituted half and half for the cream. This one is a keeper--perfect for fall suppers with crusty bread and salad.

It was hard to decide between 4 or 5 stars.  I gave it a 5 because the recipe is very good.  In my opinion it just needed a little more spices.  I used allspice, a lot of nutmeg & a little bit of white pepper.  I still recommend it and remember not to skip the cream.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!! I added an apple, and some curry to taste.  I also used a little cream cheese instead of heavy cream (simply because I didn't have any). A little salt, and it was just fantastic. Suprisingly super-easy too! Worth the time, delicious!

A very nice recipe! The heavy cream does make a difference so be sure to use it. I made a batch of this as a trial run for Thanksgiving dinner. We love it and can't wait to serve it at Thanksgiving!

This was really really yummy.  Hardest part is peeling the squash.  I added a whole cup of heavy cream because... well, because it came in a one-cup container and one can never have too much cream, right?  Will definitely make it again!

Remarkably complex and multi-layered flavor!  Adding the cream would have been gilding the lilly.  This is what Autumn is supposed to taste like.

I loved this recipe!  Served this soup at a family dinner party.  I added 1 tsp of minced garlic to the onions and carrots when they were cooking.  I also added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper but that actually made it too spicy.  Will use this recipe again but cut back on the cayenne pepper.  A lovely autumn soup!

This recipe was fabulous! Very warm, cozy, and satisfying. Although I did substitute one golden delicious apple for the carrots, and it was perfect. It added just a touch of sweetness. I also lightened it by omitting the heavy cream and stirring in about 2 tbsp. of sour cream at the end.

This turned out very good!  I took earlier suggestions for additions and put in a few of my own, adding chopped garlic, cayenne pepper and flax seed (about a tablespoon when adding spices and then another pinch right before digging in).  Good stuff!  I also used sour cream instead of heavy cream - not sure which is healthier, but I like the flavor in my other "cream of" homemade soups.

I've made it quite a few times now & I've found that the type of chicken broth is important. I like Knorr. I also think the tastiness has a lot to do with spicing it up. Don't be afraid to add more pepper or nutmeg. For a change, minced ginger could also be added.

I've used baby carrots and fresh squash from a farm market, added coffee cream instead of heavy cream and a dash of alspice. Even my husband, who would never eat any squash, liked this soup. I would suggest using blender instead of food processor - it made much smoother puree.

Everyone loved this soup but my husband but he's kind of a Plain Jain when it comes to food.  I followed others advise and baked the squash first so it was easier to peel, and used allspice and sugar as others suggested.  I also used evaporated skim milk instead of cream but it tasted like it was missing something so I added more butter which fixed it up.  (so much for saving calories) This soup tasted great but it was a lot of work so I'm not sure I would rush to make it again.

Served this at a dinner party as the starter.  Everyone raved so much I was nervous the rest of the meal wouldn't live up to it's standard.  I put a scoop of nutmeg into a tea diffuser and set this in a small bowl so people could sprinkle nutmeg over their bowl.  That went well.

Very easy recipe.  I tried it without the cream for a healthier, weight-watcher friendly recipe.  It could use a little more kick than just the nutmeg, but is still delicious!

So easy and yet so delicious.  The taste had such subtlety that I was surprised how easy it was to make.  I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth.  Other than that, I stuck closely to the recipe for terrific results!

GREAT recipe!  I've never made squash bisque before (I've actually never made anything with squash in it at all before!) but I will definitely be making this in the future!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and I sliced the squash lengthwise, seeded it and laid it in an inch of water, and softened it in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes.  It was so easy to get the squash out of its skin that way.  I also added a little orange zest and allspice while simmering the vegetables and broth.  Thanks Phonelady for this recipe!

This recipe is amazing.  A cool variation is to add 1 tsp - 1 tbsp high quality curry powder when you sautee the onion, then skip the nutmeg.  This makes a spicy squash soup with a real kick, and you don't even need the cream to make it rich tasting....

Thank You for this WONDERFUL recipe! It is definately on my favorite list.....so easy and elegant....I made it even easier, I bought the squash already peeled and chopped! You have got to try it..it'll be one of your favorites too! The next time I make it, { which will be soon} I'm going to try it over cheese raviolis..

This soup is great!  Instead of heavy cream I used half and half.  It's not as creamy and rich if you don't add some cream at the end.

Beautiful dish!  I don't think the cream (or some dairy product) should be optional.  Without it, you have tasty baby food.

very easy, elegant, yummy.
i only had plain yogurt on hand, so i substituted that for the heavy cream.  also added a bit of chopped, smoked ham.  i need to make this for friends...i have no doubt that they will love it too.

I loved this, with some modification...I, also, don't measure! 2 ROASTED butternut squash, 1/2 yellow onion, 2 generous teaspoons minced garlic, about 3 carrots, 2 TART apples, added ground cloves and 2 bay leaves. Please, after broth boils, simmer your soups for AT LEAST 30 (I do at least 45) minutes before removing bay leaves and pureeing (I also use blender wand... It's the ONLY way to make smooth soups with ease). Then, add cream (or half&half-about 2 cups)stir and season to taste. Yum. Have made this many times!

Very easy to make. Definitely roast the butternut before making the soup, it added depth to the flavor.

Made this today for lunch.   I roasted everything in olive oil (bought cubed butternut squash at grocery store.  who knew? lol) and added celery, an orange pepper, and a shallot.    I sauteed the celery and garlic but roasted everything else.  Followed directions and added suggestions of others - used a bay leaf, touch of cayenne and I decided to use pumpkin spice instead of just nutmeg.  Needed more broth so ended up using a combo of veg stock and chicken stock.  Topped it with sour cream mixed with some honey and pumpkin spice.  Did not use any dairy in soup.  DELICIOUS!!!! Next time, I might consider putting it through a sieve for smoother texture, but was enjoying results with immersion blender today!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe expect for "a dash' of nutmeg before serving.  I used about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg in the prepartion which was just right for me.  Recipe states "to taste". It's delicious! I will be making again.

As other reviews suggested: I roasted the squash, added an apple with the carrots, bay leaf and cayenne. I meant to add garlic, but forgot. Guess I'll also add that next time. Also omitted the cream.

This soup is so good. I add an apple to the sautéed onions, along with cayenne, bay leaf, and nutmeg. I use bone broth and definitely add cream. We made a triple batch to freeze some.

I thought the recipe was a good base to start from.  What I did differently was roast the squash and add one orange pepper to keep with the orange color and add a little bit more sweetness.  I personally used a stick blender instead of a food processor or standard type blender, and it came out super smooth and creamy.

I loved this and so did my one year old daughter. I made a few changes: I didn’t use the heavy cream; added 2 cloves of garlic with the onion; added a pinch of dill and used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg (out of nutmeg); added 1 tablespoon of cilantro and 1/2 tablespoon of green onion just before blending. Additionally, it made our kitchen smell sooo yummy! Will definitely be making again.

Fabulous with roasted squash added in before the blending, with a tablespoon of yogurt and 3 sprigs of parsley and a pinch of cayenne. And a dash of powdered garlic and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon. This soup is evidence that God loves us...hoo yeah!

Loved this recipe! I substituted chicken stock for water, baked the butternut squash as suggested (not convinced this is necessary) and added plenty of pepper and nutmeg at the end.  Very creamy after using immersion blender and very flavorful.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I made substitutions with what I had on hand and it turned out great:  half and half instead of heavy cream, turkey broth instead of vegetable, and vidalia onion instead of white.  I used an immersion blender instead of food processor.  My family loved it but my son did say he thought it was a bit sweet.  Yet the sweetness is all natural from the squash and carrot. The only thing difficult about the recipe is peeling the squash. So if I have time next time I make it, I will roast the squash and scoop it out.  I saved it to my collection and will definitely make it again.  Happy cooking to you!

I made this using my Instant Pot.  I didn't measure.  I used 1 qty 2 lb butternut squash (peeled and cut up), 1/2 an onion chopped, 1 medium sized shredded carrot, 1 granny smith apple cored but not peeled.  I sauted the onions and garlic directly in the Instant Pot.  Once tender, I simply dumped in the shredded carrot, apple and squash into the Instant Pot.  I added 3 cups of vegetable broth, salt, pepper and nutmeg (just a dash). I cancelled "saute" cycle and then set to high pressure for 10 minutes.  Once completed, I speed vented the Instant Pot, removed the lid, dumped everything into my Vitamix (lid on tight) and pureed.  I poured the soup in a bowl and just drizzled a little cream on top!  Delicious!

I am eating this as I type! I also followed the advice of many reviews to roast my squash. I used gourmet ground black pepper and pink salt. I also added half of an granny Smith apple and a whole purple carrot. I love the flavor of this and it's simplicity.  My immersion blender made quick work of all the lumps . After the lump removal I added the heavy cream and shaved some fresh nutmeg in. Will be freezing at least half and using it as a base for some veggie gumbo sauce on rice!

This is a basic recipe that can be modified to your liking.  My primary recommendation, as others have said, is to bake the squash.  I wrapped it in foil and baked it at 425 for over an hour as it was a big squash.  I waiting until the center was soft and the squash began to ooze its sugars through the holes that I punched with a shish kebob skewer to check for doneness.  It is so much more flavorful than boiling.  It peels easily and can be hand mashed to any consistency or put in the food processor for an even, smooth puree.  You can add any of the aromatic spices and celery seed if desired.  If using fresh celery, I would strain it after boiling to remove any strings.  You can vary the amount of liquid to suit also or use white wine instead of broth and/or milk.  If reviewers think this is a bland soup, then they probably boiled the squash.  Anyway,  bake it, to release the sugars, and have it your way with spices! Oh yeah, and the wine.

I make it exactly as written, except that I use pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.  I omit cream, as I have tried both ways and can't tell the difference.

This bisque was a big hit with my family.  I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream and bought the pre-cut butternut squash to save time (and arm strength!)  I also used regular salted butter instead of unsalted, and doubled the recipe.  This will definitely be regular in my house!  Yum!!

This was good I was out of carrots so I did not use those, And I added 2 white potatoes to give it more body. I only did a couple teaspoons of half and half instead of the half cup of heavy cream, and I added some cardamom in addition to the nutmeg.

I thought it was at least fair to good.  I've made it twice now.  The first time I left out the nutmeg and added just a restaurant size pack of salt and pepper.  It was definitely lacking flavor.  This time I added two restaurant size packets of salt and pepper, 1 tbsp of nutmeg and about a teaspoon of cinnamon-much better.  I did the trick about putting the squash face down  in the oven with some water and that made it a lot easier to prepare the squash.

Roasted the squash first ( very browned) and used chicken bone broth for added flavor. Loved this soup.  Great way to warm up with a grilled cheese.

The first time I made this, it was incredibly bland. 
My adjustments the second time around were as follows:
-I added one roasted sweet potato for fiber and natural sweetness.
-I added two tablespoons of tomato puree, for depth of flavor.
-I added one tablespoon of brown sugar.
-Pinch of cinnamon.

The above additions made for a more-flavorful, rich soup.

This soup was super easy to make, although I found it to be much more time consuming (chopping) than 1 hour.   On the other hand, that could be my ADD at work.    Eeek.

I did change  things a little.  I didn't have any vegetable stock on hand, so I used 4.5 chicken bouillon cubes with 4.5 cups of water.  I boiled that together before I even added it to the vegetables.  Also, I added two small Granny Smith apples.    I think this really gave the bisque a more rounded flavor.
 
Overall, I would definitely recommend this recipe.   Easy to understand and easy to make.   Two thumbs up here.

This was a well received recipe in my household.  While sauteing the the onions in butter, i put in a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic.  This addition elevated the flavor.  Once done, i garnished with croutons and this in itself was a hearty enough to stand as a meal.

I read a few comments before making this soup and followed their suggestions. I cut the butternut squash in half and roasted it then let it cool so it was easy to scoop out. I added a clove of garlic in when the onions were almost done sautéing. I added about a cup of onions and a cup of carrots. I cooked the carrots in the broth without the butternut squash since I already roasted it. I also added 1/2 cup of half and half. I think next time I would add more garlic to give it a little more flavor. I added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese to give it a little flavor and it was really good! I think next time I will add an apple to give it a little more flavor. Yum!

I made this soup and absolutely loved it.  I did make some additions to it... I made a double batch and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 little container Knorr Homestyle concentrated chicken stock (not the powder they come in a small box of 4) and it was absolutely amazing.... got smashing reviews at my dinner party that it was the best they've tasted.  And I absolutely roasted the squash first which made it so much easier to peel and dice afterwards.  (slice in half, scoop out the seeds, place in pan face down, add a little water and then bake at 375 for 45 minutes)

This is THE BEST butternut soup that I have ever had, my husband says way better than a high end restaurant! Heaven on a spoon, can't wait to make this again. Made as written but I eyeballed everything instead of measuring and I threw in part of a light green pepper I had laying around.

Made it "almost" exactly by the book.  I ended up with a little more than 2 cups of squash and didn't want to waste it, so I added more carrots and more onions.  (I had to go back and edit this because I realized it didn't have vegetable stock so I used chicken broth) I wasn't sure on the nutmeg so I used 1/4 teaspoon & that was perfect.  This is fantastic!  I've had lobster bisque at a high end restaurant & this was every bit as good...minus the lobster of course.  DEFINITELY making this again!!!  I'll try roasting the squash next time to compare.

This Bisque is so yummy. This is the second time I have made this recipe.   It can be difficult to peel the squash I will try the roasting first next time.

I thought this was great!  I bought the pre-peeled and sliced squash which made it quick and easy.  I also added the apples that another reviewer noted and a couple cloves of garlic.  I also added curry which added just the right flavor to make this complete.  Delicious!

I used coconut oil instead of the oil and butter, and instead of heavy cream I used buttermilk, which did help give it a more creamy texture.  I used 3 carrots, and also 2 Yukon gold potatoes.  It's decent soup and easy enough to make.  I'd probably use it again.

I am not one who likes squash, but I found this recipe to be fantastic. I added some sage and some fresh ginger, but I think that this recipe is great without. Roasting the squash first is a good idea.

We loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called, except I microwaved the squash for easier peeling and added just a dust of cayenne pepper for a hint of heat. It came out awesome! Can't wait to make it again.

It's a good basic recipe.  I must say peeling a butternut squash ranks up there as one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Next time I will roast it first. Duh!  I gave it a taste before I pureed it and it wasn't sweet enough for me.  I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and then it was really good.  I'll make it again with the tweaks!

Tasty! Part of T-Day Week Warm-Ups. I did try it for lunch without the heavy whipping cream (good) and dinner with the cream (richer taste).

Didn't roast squash first, that might be a good idea.  I used a whole pint of whipping cream and that was a mistake, it was too creamy.  It does need some kind of additional seasoning.  It's quite sweet and needs maybe... spice or savory to balance it

I made this with minor changes.  Baked the squash at 375 covered.  Used a whole onion and cooked it to just starting to caramelize.  Seasoned with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt.  Left out the cream but garnished with a bit of mexican three cheese shredded cheese.  This is a great basic recipe!  Thanks

Yum yum yum, I've always wanted to make butternut squash soup but never thought it would be that exciting. I was wrong, this was delicious, I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect, I did use the cream but it was delicious before that too. Make this soup!

Delish. My go-to! I've left the cream out or used almond milk and its perfect either way. I also like to add a peeled, chopped apple with the squash and carrot, the a little cider to the broth. I'll keep this one around!

Great base, but would be bland as is. I added thyme and roasted the squash with salt pepper and nutmeg first and it added a whole new level of flavor. I also used an emersion blender and left some of the carrots un-pureed to give it texture. May be a bit baby food like If you put it in a blender. But this recipe is a good place to start!

LOVE this recipe. I took the commenter's advice and roasted the squash first. However, I cut it all up and just roasted it in the pot I was cooking it in until it got slightly tender. It's good with and without the heavy whipping cream.

I made this today only using the recipe as a guideline.  Having coated with olive oil, salt & pepper I roasted the butternut squash along with two carrots, an onion cut in half and a garlic bulb cut in half for aprox 45min at 350. I used vegetable broth & continued to cook veggies in the broth with a bay leaf for 45min so they were very soft. Removed the bay leaf & blended until smooth. I added butter milk instead of heavy cream & I seasoned to taste with salt, pepper & freshly ground nutmeg. Turned out amazing & I will be making this often.

I also added 1 stalk celery chopped, used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I roasted my vegetables in the oven for 1 hour at 350* I also used 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg.
Excellent with or without the cream.
 I have made it with buttercup squash and it is even better!

Delish! I took the advice of another review and added a cored, peeled golden delicious apple. I also added a dash of cinnamon and dark brown sugar. My daughter is allergic to dairy so I used unsweetened Almond Breeze milk. Great recipe! (I took a picture but it won't load)

Loved it. And great idea in the reviews to roast the squash first and leave out the cream. Turned out great.

I've never made butternut squash soup before this came out nicely-- I easily got 4 servings. This recipe can take more than 1 hr to make if you pre-roast your squash.The second time I made it I cooked it in the microwave for 10 min with poked holes,1" water.
I used 1 butternut squash which was enough for the proportions I used(approximately 9" long,9"around) If you forget to take out your seeds beforehand it can be done after.  I recovered 2-1/4 cups of squash innards. 

I started on the stove after the squash was done in the oven. I cooked 1 onion (I love onions) in no more than 1tbsp of unsalted butter for 5-10 minutes; then I threw in my 3, small-ish rainbow carrots (also about 9" in length). It took me a while to scoop out all of the butternut squash innards, but they were super-soft, and I just stirred them in with the carrots and onions gradually, so the ingredients were together without stock for longer than usual. 

For stock: I poured in 3 to 3-1/2 cups of cold tap water into my pot, stirred, and then put in 3 teaspoons of Knorr chicken bouillon. B/c of this, I used no extra seasoning (family/guests can season their own bowls). Heated for 15-20 min(again: my squash was already cooked-->less cook time).

I poured the soup into individual cups and bowls to cool faster ->  food processor. Took 1/2hr to cool; pureed; was great without cream (let folks add to own bowls). Added 2 tbsp of cream to 2-1/2"c of soup and it was great.

I roast the squash for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees then proceed with the recipe. I may add the cream but it didn't add anything for me so I leave it out. My husband is not a big fan of blended soups but LOVED this recipe. Also after it was cooled my 6 month old tasted it and loved it as well. I am currently making my third batch!

First time making this soup. I was looking for something different. Roasting the squash first definitely helps. Also I added garlic, a golden delicious apple, and a lil cayenne pepper to it...wanted something spicy. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of the butter and other oil to make it a little healthier.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it several times.  Once I added curry for a twist.  There is so much you can do or just leave it be.  Great with Italian Bread fresh from the oven. . .

I liked this soup at first, but *Loved It* after making a couple tweeks based on IMVINTAGE's review and a couple others. I followed the original recipe pretty closely going a little heavy on the carrots, which I liked, and I used a high quality organic vegetable stock from Trader Joe's - really important. I've used this stock in other soups and it really adds a great flavor. After adding everything the original called for, I added a large clove of garlic and a granny smith apple (credit: IMVINTAGE). The apple is genius! I would never have thought to add apple to soup myself, but glad I did b/c the tiny bit of tartness was perfection.
I pureed half the soup for one meal and left the other half for my husband who is going to use it over pork chops later this week (I think the apple flavor gave him the idea). I'm vegan and he's not so it can be a lot of work finding/cooking things we both like - this recipe worked out great!

An easy soup if you make as directed by keeping it simple and cook the squash first.Next time perhaps I will use something more healthy then heavy cream.I am trying to eat better, staying away from Fast food and pizza joints.

The only thing I changed was to add a bit of garlic and a cinnamon stick and it was delicious. Everybody loved it. Luckily my grocery store sells the squash already cut up for about $3.00 a pound. Totally worth it to save the time and trouble of cutting it up.

We substituted buttercup squash for the butternut (it's what we had), added grated fresh ginger and fresh garlic. We left out the cream, but added a little half and half in each bowl when serving--just a pretty swirl. It was absolutely delicious. I am making it again already b/c I have guests coming.

I really liked this recipe.  The carrots added a nice texture and consistency to the bisque.  I used an immersion blender which worked wonders and saved dirtying up my food processor.  The only thing I may try next time is adding some cream cheese to make it creamier, but overall I enjoyed the true taste of butternut squash more than anything.

The nutmeg is very strong. Would not use more than a dash, literally. Otherwise, a good soup.

Easily adaptable to a vegan dish.  Since I am the only one in my family who likes squash and soups, I halved this recipe and made it in a 3 1/2 qt. slow cooker on low for 6 hrs.  To simplify the squash part, I bought it cubed in the freezer section, thawed it in the fridge overnight, then fried it in a skillet for a few minutes with about a Tbsp. (tablespoon) of vegan spread to give it enhanced flavor.  I added about 1/2 c. celery and minced it in the food processor with the onion and carrot.  I also added about 1 Tbsp. minced, jarred garlic since I love all the flavors together.  I took previous reviewers' suggestions and peeled and cored a Granny Smith apple and ground that along with the above veggie mix.  I skipped the cream since I'm trying to cut back on dairy and fat calories and used a vegan broth mix.  I can tell this flavor will be great with some kale chips crushed and sprinkled on top.  Freezes well.

I wasn't impressed. Followed the recipe to a T. I even had the Hubby help cut the squash. :-) It needed something still. I even added some cinnamon along with the nutmeg. I shall just keep on looking for that perfect butternut soup recipe. I shared with my Mom, who agreed that it needed something more. Thanks anyway Phonelady55

Simple, silky, subtle!  
This isn't an overwhelming soup, bold flavors.  Next time, I'll make double.  Leave out the cream to freeze it, then add when I reheat later.  Dreamy!

Ok the soup is absolutely delicious.  The taste deserves 5 stars, and I haven't even added the cream yet (and still can't decide if I will it's so good without it!).  However butternut squash has got to be the most difficult vegetable I have ever peeled and cubed!  And for any other novice chefs like myself BE AWARE this squash secretes a juice that will cause severe dry skin! Use gloves or something! Not painful but incredibly disgusting.  Recipe is awesome! But a lot of prep, which is the only reason I gave it one less star than perfect!

I like this. I have never made a bisque before. I baked the butternut squash first like the most helpful review said. I added garlic when cooking the onions. I did not use heavy cream, but instead used a little bit of light sour cream. I put a teaspoon of pepper in which was a bit too much, but the kick is nice. This was way easier than I thought it was going to be. Thanks!

I've recently started enjoying bisque, especially butternut squash, at restaurants.  This was my first attempt and it was without a doubt the best I have ever had!  So easy, so creamy, so flavorful!  Like a fine wine, there were layers of flavor, especially the onion.  I have so many new favorites because of this website and this is definitely one of them!

I loved it! I am a beginner cook and found this recipe easy to follow.I added some fresh basil and parsley for flavor. And I'm not sure if the squash were just small but it took about 2 and 1/2 to make four cups.   

PS definitely bake the squash first!

Just made this tonight. It was wonderful! I had never had butternut squash before and I am so happy that I tried this. I did roast squash first as recommended and it was very easy. The peeling part wasn't, but I will figure that out. There has to be an easier way, regardless, I loved this and can't wait to have it for lunch again tomorrow! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I used purchased cubed butternut squash from the supermarket so this was very quick to put together.  I added 1 inch of fresh ginger to the blender; it adds a nice kick.  I added some potatoes instead of the cream for a nice vegan version of this recipe.  I shared some with a sick friend and she loved it.

I followed it exactly as it was listed and it is delicious! I think cooking the squash in the broth instead of cooking it in the oven adds flavor because it gets to simmer in the seasonings. It is a little difficult to peel it, but it was totally worth it in the end. A little tip is to slice the skin with a sharp knife on a cutting board because it goes faster than a peeler.

Easy and good. I subbed curry powder for nutmeg and added a small pinch of rosemary. I also did  the roast-the-squash-first trick in the microwave. My 2+ lb squash needed about 15 mins in the microwave.

I really liked this recipe.  I was a little unsure because I have only had butternut squash once and didn't care for it, but had one so decided to try it.  Has good flavor and was really quick.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe is certainly a keeper. I am not a huge fan of altering recipes on my first try, but I had food in the oven and on the stovetop when I realized that I would need to substitute in chicken stock in place of the vegetable stock--but the soup still turned out beautifully. I also baked the squash instead of peeling and cubing it.

Be VERY careful if you decide to use your blender - I don't have a hand mixer, and ended up having steam cause my soup to explode out of my blender and seriously burnt my hand.  I liked this as a base recipe, but made quite a few changes - I roasted my squash, cooked the onion in butter and about a tablespoon of bacon grease, used 3 large cloves of garlic, used chicken broth I had in the fridge, and served it topped with bacon.  Yummy!! It was the first time I ever cooked with or even ate butternut squash, and now it's one of my favorites.  Try roasting the seeds with some salt - they're way tastier than pumpkin seeds!!

Wonderful soup, made a few changes to suite my taste:  added garlic with the onion, sage instead of nutmeg and for a healthier version Greek yogurt instead of cream.  I like mine chunky so didn't liquify but blended nicely in a blender.  Great addition to my recipe box.

Made this a few weeks back for a dinner party.  It was enjoyed by all.  I did tweak a bit as other suggested in other reviews.  I too bake the squash before peeling with a little olive oil and salt & pepper.  I also add cayenne pepper and cinnamon to taste.  I also used more nutmeg.  The result was homey and tasty.  I also used my immersion blender instead of transfering to blender - so much neater and easier!

Love the original and love everyone's comments. I used a mix of chicken stock and veg stock and no milk product at all. I used bay leaf, an apple, two shakes of cayenne pepper, allspice instead of nutmeg (I am alergic) and added rosemary and fennel seed. I also used roasted butternut squash.

I made the recipe as written, without the optional heavy cream. I liked it well enough, wasn't bad, but wasn't outstanding. I will try reheating the leftovers tonight and adding an apple like another reviewer suggested.

Awesome recipe!!  I did take the advice of the others and roasted the squash and used half and half.  I think I added a little too much half and half because it came out too runny to be a bisque but too thick to be a soup.  It was still delicious and I ate mine with Zesta oyster crackers which are nice and buttery...good compliment to the soup. Enjoy!!

This recipe has become our Halloween staple for the last 5 years.  It is so simple and delicious, even my picky kids love it.  I do not use any butter, and we don't add any cream.  It doesn't need the added fat for such a healthy recipe, and other than making it slightly creamier, it doesn't do anything for flavor.  I add about 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and probably a teaspoon of salt.  I decrease this amount if not using low-sodium broth.  I have made it with chicken broth as well, but much prefer the veggie broth.  I always use an immersion blender right in the pot after the veggies are tender.  I learned quickly that it is not a good idea to put hot soup into a standard blender or food processor.  The immersion blender gives it the perfect consistency. It is not a spicy soup, the flavoring is simple, but it is perfect for a cold autumn evening.  We serve out of bread bowls and with hot wassail.

Fantastic!  Brought this to a potluck and got rave reviews!  I roasted the squash like others.  Also, I added one clove of garlic and 1/2 Granny Smith apple as others suggested, and the optional heavy cream.  I found that 2.5 - 3 pounds of squash will be enough for 4 cups.

I like others microwave my squash so things go a little faster. I also add a pealed and cored apple. Usually a granny smith apple. I add a tiny bit of cayenne or sometimes a little thyme depending on the mood. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This soup was awesome. I made a few changes. I  roasted the squash first and added a little garlic and used chicken stock because that's what I had on hand. Nice to find a recipe where I don't have to go get something at the store! My son loved it and had no idea it was yucky squash :) I also added some lump crab on top just because I had it. It was unbelievably good.

I loved this soup! I've made it several times now, and I think the most recent making turned out the best. I more or less followed the recipe as is, but I made a few additions: I sauted the onions with some garlic and crumbled bacon; I oven-roasted the squash; and I added some cayan pepper to taste (it didn't take much!). This soup is especially delicious when eaten with a grilled cheese sandwich. Such a tasty recipe!  :)

I made this with my boyfriend, and it is definitely a great healthy soup.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it lacked some flavor. The first night we ate it pretty much the way the recipe was written, and we did include the cream. The next night I added some smartbalance butter to the soup when I warmed it up and it definitely gave it a bigger buttery flavor; I think helped a lot.

Pretty good soup.  There really aren't a lot of flavors hanging around other than the butternut squash itself; I love butternut squash so it was fine for me; if you want more of a flavor, add more seasonings to punch it up a bit.  I didn't use heavy cream but did add maybe 1/4 c of regular milk--it didn't thin it out too much, and it is a nice soup for a fall day.  Lovely with sandwiches!  thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!! I used this basic recipe, then incorporated certain reviewer comments (adding a full apple, for example) for a wonderful outcome (except for the cut on my finger, which was my own fault for not reading the MANY notes about roasting the squash first!!).     I should think a nicely-sharpened santoku knife helps - I was overdue in acquiring one, anyway!  We'll see:  now I'm ready to try again!    Recipe-wise: I used 2/3 the squash and increased the carrots and onions to replace.  Added a big minced garlic clove, a Tbs or so of cinnamon, a tsp of minced ginger, and used 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup organic veg broth. I still have rosemary in the garden so added about 3 sprigs of that. Also used half&half instead of cream (just a little, at that). Once it was pureed and reheated a tad, before serving I added an additional sprinkling of nutmeg and cinnamon, plus some grated parmesan.

Yummy butternut squash soup!  The recipe would have been easier to follow if it had given directions on how to heat the squash to make it easier to cut into cubes.  Other than that, this was a great recipe.

My boyfriend can't stop raving about this soup. It's very simple to make and surprisingly, the squash cooked soft in about 25 minutes. I thought that it needed just a hint of another herb and I will experiment with thyme, basil and maybe oregano. Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche or cooked pancetta/bacon bits

I love the carrot flavor in this soup. I didn't have much broth so I used a 1/2 cup of beef broth (all I had) and the rest water and the soup came out tasty.  Seasonal squash and carrots hold their own.  So GOOD!

This turned out great.  Next time I would blend it even smoother.  I thought the cream was a great addition at the end.  I did not have a carrot and I think that made it lose a bit of sweetness.

This soup was delicious!!!!  I roasted the squash the night before so it was already ready in the morning when I made the soup.  I added a little garlic and used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  I will definately be making this often!!  Has anyone out there doubled or tripled the recipe???  I think i'll try it next batch!

I added a couple of cloves of garlic (what could be bad about that>) and added about 4 small fingerling potatoes to the mix just because I had them and didn't want to waste them.  I kept the cream but it probably would be almost as good without it, or half the qty. for those watching the calories.    This soup was fantastic!  Probably the best soup I have ever made and will be a winter standard in my house from now own.  It will also be one on the entertainment menu.  It is easy and elegant.    I served with parmesan croutons.   Try toasting pumpkin seeds for a special garnish.

Delicious! So creamy and good on a fall day!  I noticed that a lot of people chose to cook the squash first, but I was limited on time so I just peeled and cut it like the recipe says!  The first cut in half really is the hardest, then a good potato peeler and a few chops later and the squash was ready to go!  No problem!  I did cook some garlic along with the onion and substituted half & half for the heavy cream.  It was very good!  Even my picky, non-vegetable eating kids and husband had to admit they liked it.

Only change I made was I used chicken stock, I don't like vegetable stock.  This was good, I probably only put about 1 tsp of salt at the beginning, definitely needs a little bit more, and a little something to make this great.  Would probably make this again.

Very good soup, especially on a cool fall day!  I cooked the squash in the oven, scooped out the of the shell, then just smashed with a spoon.  I whisked all ingredients together and let it simmer a while.  I did end up with a few little pieces of carrot, onion and squash in the soup, but it was worth it to save myself from having to clean the blender!  I left out the cream to keep it healthier.  I will make this again, soon!

I did not add carrots but used a whole onion and 1.5 stalks of celery. I also added a spoonful of honey and pure maple syrup and used chicken broth instead of veggie.

We love this recipe - I add a few red pepper flakes, a bay leaf, and some sweet tart apple.  Also, just wanted to mention that butternut squash peel very easily with a vegetable peeler before they are cooked!

This dish requires very little editing (which is a good thing!).  I took the top reviewer's advice and roasted the squash first.  Definitely save time and cut the squash in half first.  Didn't bother with the cream as it was rich and creamy already as is.  Next time, I may add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more liquid so it's a less thick.  I foresee myself making this a lot in the coming months!

I made this as-is, substituting coconut oil for the canola oil and butter, and skim milk for the heavy cream, and it was definitely bland. I sauteed a few celery stalks, added a dash of allspice, and pureed it all again and it made a world of difference. A tsp or two of fresh grated ginger root would have made this a real "wow" dish.

This is one of our absolute favorite fall dishes. It's so filling and so healthy. It makes a great meal with just some good crunchy bread and maybe a salad on the side. Cream isn't necessary except for presentation. Unless you're fixing it for guests, I'd save the money because you don't really need all that you'll have to buy. My only complaint about this recipe is that you have to add a lot of salt (at least I feel like I do), but I've also added a small amount of cayenne pepper for just a little kick, and that makes a huge difference. Delicious.

OMG....this is sooo good.  I just made it.  I did a few things a little differently.  I steamed the squash.  While the squash was steaming, I cooked the onion in olive oil.  I then added the steamed squash to the cooked onion.  I then put in one carton of organic vegetable broth.  I omitted the carrot because I didn't have any.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little cinnamon.  I mixed and threw it all into a blender.  It came out perfect!

Exceptional. Just like a restaurant. I had to leave out the carrots and it was still delicious. Served it in homemade bread bowls and we were all very full after that meal.

I may have altered the recipe too much to give it a true rating but it was pure heaven in a bowl so I had to give it 5 stars! (sorry to all those who hate raters like me) I roasted the squash first (45 min at 350, cut side down, drizzled with olive oil). I didn't have cream so i used a bar of reduced fat cream cheese. First butternut squash soup i've ever put in my mouth and i am amazed I went this long in my life without having it! Even if you don't know if like squash, try it. this soup will make you a fan!

This is an amazing recipe!!!  The carrots give this dish give a sweetness that's perfect.  Be sure to let the carrots cook thoroughly, I had lumps because I was too anxious :)  I used chicken stock instead of the vegetable stock and I think that was a great but not necessary substitution.  Loved it!

This was 'meh' for me. Not spectacular but decent.  I used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream.    You want a squash that's about 3 lbs. A little bland, think this needs more spices. I won't be trying again, sorry.

I didn't really care for this.  Not sure what it was.  I love butternut squash.

My first time to cook butternut squash!  To cook the squash, I used the microwave method recommended by other readers. I doubled the onions and added garlic!  I did not use nutmeg.  This will be a new family favorite.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner on Saturday night, and I served it in hollowed-out gourds. I had 10 people for dinner, and everyone couldn't stop raving about it. I made the soup two days in advance and kept it refrigerated. When it came time to serve it, I squirted the cream and swirled it on top, with a sprinkle of nutmeg and chopped fresh chives from my garden. I highly recommend this recipe!

This came out great using chicken buillion instead of veggie broth. The soup would be fine without the heavy cream; I used some half-and-half since that's what I had on hand. I imagine this is about as good as butternut squash can get.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made it in my enameled dutch oven pot.  Butternut squash soup is an awesome fall-ish recipe!  A few things I did differently: I cooked the veggies in the pot with onion and garlic (I only used a handful of baby carrots for color and nutrition - not a lot), then emptied them into a colander to empty out the chicken broth.  Then I did use the heavy cream, but maybe 1/4 cup and I used my immersion blender through the entire pot.  It looked a lot like a veggie puree.  Then I kept adding back fresh chicken stock slowly until I got the correct bisque-like texture I desired.  I always have parmesan rinds sitting around, so I threw them in the stock to get them nice and mushy and infuse the parmesan taste into the soup.  I did this after I pureed the soup.  I also added some white pepper, a very small amount of cinnamon, 1/2 of a freshly grated nutmeg and some french grey sea salt (I had used regular kosher in the cooking process).  It was perfectly seasoned.  I leave it in the big pot overnight in the fridge to meld the flavors together and will divide them into single servings today for lunches and easy-to-grab dinner!

Butternut squash soup is one of my favorite foods so I was excited to make it on my own for the first time. It turned out good but not great. DH said it tasted like carrot soup, I also used chicken base and water and it turned out too "chicken-ey". I added just a small amount of half and half at the very end but did not want to dilute the squash flavor. Next time it will be better, I wont use so many carrots and use less water. I roasted two squash at once and froze one for another batch, I will try again this weekend.

This was really good but I like things pretty spicy so I added some chopped jalapenos to taste.  It added a bit of texture and spiciness.

You can't beat this recipe for it's ease and delicious flavor.  Love to make it in the fall.  Makes a nice first course.  I used fat-free half-n-half instead of cream.

If I could give this recipe a million stars I would! I'm being completely serious when I say that this is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I will say that I changed some ingredients around to make it vegan: I used a tbsp. of Earth Balance margarine, omitted the oil, and used unsweetened soy milk instead of the cream. It was PERFECT!

This was the first time I ever tried cooking with Butternut Squash--recipe was very easy and turned out delicious! Like others, I baked the squash beforehand for 35 minutes at 375. I also subsituted onion powder for onion since I am not an onion fan which worked out fine.

As is I give it 4 stars.  I think it a bit bland.  I am recovering from bowel surgery and am on a soft diet.  However a dish can be within my limitations and still have flavor.  My jazzed up version of this soup hit the mark.  I added some dried wild puffball mushrooms that I picked last fall and some commercial shiitakes, some thyme, a bay leaf, and some dulse seaweed.  Of course I roasted the squash beforehand -- didn't even think of putting raw squash in with the boil.  I drizzled a tsp of half and half on top and twirled it to make a nice design and sprinkled with fresh rosemary and freshly grated nutmeg.  Mmmmmmmm!

Fabulous.  Creamy. Delicious. Easy.  Warm and Filling.  I roasted the squash and sauteed the carrots with the onions but those were the only alterations I made.  The cream is a must as it makes it decadent!

This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was add ground ginger, cinnamon, cayanne (just a pinch), and a bay leaf in addition to the nutmeg.  For a finishing touch (and to add a savory flavor) I crumbled pancetta and drizzled a little of the oil over top. This is a keeper!

Loved this soup! I followed someone's advice of boiling the squash for 4 minutes to ease the peeling process and it really helped. My three year old even loved it.  Next time I will use a blender because when I poured it into the food processor it leaked miserably.

yum. i doubled the recipe -- using precubed butternut squash from costco really helped :) i added cinnanmon and a little brown sugar, too, and although i find that usually cream is unnecessary, it really does make this recipe. the whole family enjoyed this.

Made for Thanksgiving '08.  This was quite good and very easy to make.  The adults enjoyed it, but, the kids... not so much.  Made homemade rosemary crackers to serve along with it.

Excellent!!  It made a great appetizer for Thanksgiving.  It will hold the crowd over until the turkey is done.  I used a low sodium vegetable broth and just added a little lawry's seasoning.

This bisque was fantastic!!! I used olive oil, increased the butter (butter light) to one stick, added more onion, roasted my squash, one cup chicken stock, garlic, one green apple, simmered with a bundle of fresh thyme, cayenne pepper, orange juice, and 1/4 cup cream. I like to make food with a TON of flavor and thought if I had not added all the extras it would have been a bit bland. This soup was a HUGE hit at a dinner party I had last evening!!!!!

This was good except I had to add a little more water to cover the squash and then it wasn't as thick as I would have liked.

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't even use onion because I didn't have in on hand.  Roasted the squash and used pureed carrots I had made for my 8 month old.  I added a pinch of cinnamon along with the nutmeg.  Loved it! Thanks for posting!

This was very good.  It was very sweet so next time I think it may be a side dish for something else.  I'm going to add some sour cream to my leftovers to see if that will cut the sweetness a little.  All in all very tasty.

This is my favorite soup of all time.  Peeling the squash isn't that hard if you use a potato peeler.

Very tasty and easy to make bisque.  I bought peeled and cubed squash from a wholesale store which took all of the work out of this recipe.  Did not add the cream and never missed it.  Also, subbed chicken stock for vegetable stock as it was all I had in the house.

This is so good...  Creamy and delightful.  Here's my tip, I peel my squash with a potato peeler.  It takes a whole two minutes to peel the entire thing.  Thanks for the receipe.

Very good, I used frozen squash from last summer and used evaporated milk, and found this very rich and thick.  I also like things a little spicy so added a few drops of tabasco, will make again, with frozen squash

I made this recipe the other day so that I would have something on hand over the weekend when my husband or I needed a snack. I was surprised that he actually liked it! He's not a soup fan in general but he ate 2 bowls full. I've been told I have to make more! My mother-in-law commented that it would make good "baby food". (I don't know if that was a hint.)

Double Duty Butternut Squash... I had a very large squash so I decided to divide it after cooking.  I used half to make a side dish and put half in the fridge.  Then the next night I used the reserved fridge portion for This Soup.  Thumbs Up!

I have always wanted to try butternut squash but I was always too afraid - that is until I found this recipe. It was awesome, even my children enjoyed it!! I did not add the full amount of cream and it was perfect! I will be making this again!!

OK, this might be weird, but if I HAD to choose one food to eat everyday for the rest of my life, I would choose this soup. It's delicious. I have made it five times now and it's wonderful every time. I have made it exactly as directed and it was so good. Now, using some of the suggestions on this site, I bake the squash, a large,sweet onion, and a large sweet potato in the oven and when they are all soft and slightly browned, I pass everything through a food processor. Sometimes, while everything is baking, I boil carrots until they are very soft and add the carrots to the mixture. As a personal preference, I thin the pureed mixture with fat free half and half, then add curry to taste. If you don't like butternut squash, you can't trust this review, but for me, this is soup perfection.

We really enjoyed this soup. I did make a few of my own changes. I seasoned with a little sea salt and season salt, cracked black pepper and dry celery powder. I also used olive oil rather than canola and used chicken stock in place of vegetable since I did not have the vegetable. We loved it. You really get a good taste of the squash and is really smooth. Very easy to make! Kept in crockpot on keep low before adding cream/milk. Used Milk thickened with a little reux in place of cream to save calories.

Fabulous soup!  I added curry powder to make it a curried squash soup, but the ratios of the original were perfect - it's velvety smooth with such a rich flavour!

I have never had butternut squash soup before.  This was a beautiful soup with a nice color and smell, but I don't think I like butternut squash :(.  It was worth the try.  Thanks for the recipe!

So simple and delicious. I make this at least twice a month now and double the recipe so we can have leftovers. My kids at 4 and 2 years old both love it as well as my picky father and yet it's so refreshing and new. Thanks!

This soup took time to prepare but was absolutely amazing!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it came out fantastic.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving and added some milk to thin it out a bit.  The flavors fused beautifully.  I will definitely make this again, but given the time commitment, it is more of a special occasion dish.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I added ginger instead of the nutmeg which gave it a not so sweet taste.  I also served it with a dollop of ricotta on top!

This is good, but very rich. I used cream but wish I had just used half & half.  I also felt it needed a lot more spice than it called for. But with the modifications I made it was very delicious, great starter for a special meal.

This is a fabulous recipe.  We double the recipe and I roast the squash, with carrots and two red peppers to soften and carmalize them.  I saute the onions with celery before adding to the soup.  My husband likes to sprinkle left over bacon on top of the soup at the time of serving.

I loved this!  It's a thick, filling soup - I didn't even need the heavy cream (which, better still, made this a healthy soup.)  Definitely suggest baking the squash first, as previously suggested, as this makes cubing it simplier.

Phenomenal!  I only wished I had doubled to recipe!  I used the heavy cream but, could have used half and half and I am sure it would have tasted almost the same!  Used lots of nutmeg though!  Such a wonderful flavor.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I roasted the squash as others suggested and added the cream (half&half is what I had). Awesome! Without the cream it was still good and healhy tasting. With the cream it was truely decadent. My husband was skeptical when he saw a squash come out of the grocery bag but he loved it too! Will be making this one all winter long. Thanks!

This was a nice change of pace for dinner.  I followed other users recommendations and added some cayenne, just a pinch.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  To top it off, I added some yellow curry spice and served it over jasmine rice.  This was a great move!  Made for a great meal, and the rice made the soup last longer, which was great since there was a lot of chopping involved!

I LOVE this soup and I never had squash before other then testing my son's babyfood. It was super simple since I used already chopped squash and an imersion blender. Couldnt have been easier and the taste is out of this world. I wish we were having company because its such a fancy looking soup with gorgeous color. Perfect for a fall dinner party

Love this recipe! My Husband and F-i-L do not like squash and love this bisque. With some brown bread, biscuits or alone it is a great fall dish.

Excellent soup - the only thing i did different was use 1 can veg broth and 2 cans chicken broth. I also added cinnimon to give and extra sweetness. Lots of chopping (i made for 12 servings) but well worth it!

All my friends loved this recipe.  I used pumpkin pie spice, and I omitted the butter altogether.  I also used precubed organic squash, which made this recipe so very easy.  Make sure you blend it enough!

This was exceptional. I did homemade chicken broth instead and since I wanted a smaller amount added half and half instead if cream.  I will DEFINATELY be making this many more times.

So glad I searched for more soup options as this was fabulous!

I reduced the butter and oil in 1/2 and used leeks and shallots since I had them instead of onions.  Also used a small butternut and small acorn since that's what the CSA brought this week!  Finally I roasted the squash for 40 minutes, and didn't need the cream to have it be 'creamy'.  For spices I added a 'shake' of nutmeg and a couple of shakes of chili powder-mainly for color and a little zip.

Not a lot of changes, mainly for what I had on hand!  Can't wait to have more of it!

Excellent recipe.  I cut the butternut squash in half, added a little water to the pan, covered with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for almost an hour.

I followed the rest of the recipe except, i omitted the nutmeg because i hate that stuff, and i added a dash of garlic powder.

Great texture and flavor.  I did take a few others ideas of adding curry and cyanne pepper along with the nutmeg!  Wonderful and spicy.  I agree there is a lot of chopping/roasting.  The next time I make it I think I will try winter squash from the frozen food section.

I've never made bisque before but I had some leftover butternut squash and gave this a try. I thought it was good but the kids were horrified at the thought of 'squash soup'and thus would not touch it!  I did find that I had to keep tweeking it to find the right flavour because there was a weird aftertaste. I had used leftover already seasoned mashed squash so i'm sure that's why.  I may try this one again.

It was good, but I thought that the flavor of the carrots was a bit overpowering. I will use less next time, and maybe add a few spices. I tasted before and after adding the cream, and it's definitly much better with.

Delicious! I used more butternut squash, because I had some left over. I halved them, scooped them, and baked them for 45 min at 350- just until they were almost cooked, but still not completely done. I used half and half and 1% milk mixture. Excellent, I will definitely make it again, and everyone loved it, even my 2 year old son had seconds.

I absolutely love this, as does my family. It is a great way to get a 2 year old to eat squash! One thing I found was if you substitute chicken stock for the vegetable stock it tastes just as good. Nice and yummy on a cold fall evening!

Good soup, but this just wasn't suited to our palets.  We prefer savory meaty soups this was too sweet and looked like baby food.  But if you are a squash lover give this a try.

Perfect recipe. Just like in a restaurant. I had an old-ish parsnip around, so I put that in too. Also added a stalk of celery, a granny smith apple, and 2 cloves of garlic. Delicious. Didn't bother to peel the apples because it all disappears into the puree anyway. I used Greek yogurt instead of the cream. Easist soup ever.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year and followed the review that said to add some apples.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it and the pot was wiped clean.  I will definitely be making this again sometime soon.

Excellent! The perfect winter soup.  I have tried this with other types of squash as well, and even substituted some sweet potato for the carrots, and it always turns out great!  The butternut squash is the best though!

We had this after carving pumpkins so we were in the spirit for orange/fall things.  It went perfect with toasted french bread and was even better the next day.  We will definately have this again.

This was excellent.  To make it a little lower fat I used 3/4 cup of skim milk instead of the heavy cream.  I also added a russet potato to the squash, carrots and onions to thicken the soup up.  I would definitly make this again.

I added allspice and a few other spices to taste.  Then I used an immersion blender right in the pot and this soup came out PERFECT!  It was the highlight of Thanksgiving dinner!

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved this recipe, even those fussy eaters that claim they don't like squash.  Has been requested for Christmas dinner.  I made it the night before and then reheated and added the cream.

SOOOOOOO good! My husband asks for it all the time and it's easy and relatively quick. I peel & microwave the squash whole, then chop it up for the stock (I also use chicken stock).

When I first made this soup, I followed exactly as written and it wasn't so special. So then I read a few reviews and added about 1/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate (not diluted), more nutmeg and sweetened with about 1 tsp of sugar. This helped to pop the flavors and made it quite enjoyable!

This tastes just like squash soup I used to buy at an expensive organic grocery. I added some garlic, cinnamon and a little cayenne based cajun spice as per prior reviews. I also used vegetable stock instead of meat. Didn't even need to add cream it was so good as is. Defenitely a keeper.

I made this at Thanksgiving to take to a relative's and again for a Christmas dinner at our home.  It was a big hit both times.  What little leftovers there were , were delicious reheated the next day.  It was a big hit and easy to make.  It will be added to my recipe book and I will definately make again! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!  I made this the night before Thanksgiving as I was a little concerned about making it for Thanksgiving as I thought perhaps people wouldn't like it.  Anyway, I had some left over that I took to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone tasted it and simply loved it!  Thanks for the recipe... I'll be making it for Thanksgiving NEXT year!

This soup was just average for me.  My local store carried frozen cubed butternut squash so prep time was a breeze.  It was quite bland so I found myself adding some maple syrup and mulling spices to add some more flavor.  All in all, just OK.

This was amazing!  I substituted the heavy cream for 6oz non-fat plain yogurt and the consistency was great.  I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  The flavor was great.  I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving too!

I used olive oil instead of canola and 3 cups of onion boullion.  My grocery store sells butternut squash cubed already - this cut down on time.  Absolutely delicious! It warms your soul! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this!!  I didn't puree it, I mashed it w/ a nylon masher, so that it was chunky.  I also added just a few teaspoons of heavy cream to avoid some of the fat.  Thanks!

This is a solid recipe. I jazzed it up a bit by adding garlic, fresh ginger, celery, allspice (to taste) instead of nutmeg, sugar (two TB), and some spicy curry powder (2TB). WOW!! This is one of the best soups I've ever made. Used 1% milk as well, gave me the creamy flavor without all the fat. 

When preparing the squash, do youself a favor and cut in wedges first then use a potato peeler to skin. This really cuts down on the prep time. Happy eating!

Most delicious soup!  Nothing left in the pot tonight.  And I was blessed with an easy to cut butternut squash, for the first time in my life!  The only thing I added to the soup was just two lumps of sugar,(not much, but just enough)as the butternut squash I happen to have was not as sweet as usual.  This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I would not change a thing!  Easy too!

This is very, very, very yummy. A great fall/autumn potluck dish. It is a little labor-intensive, as peeling & cutting squash is pretty difficult (it's very hard). I experimented a bit with microwaving it first, but nothing I've found really made a difference in the total time and effort. Except for this particular step, it's easy to put together.
