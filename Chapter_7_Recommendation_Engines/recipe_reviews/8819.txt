Very good; I made two changes*. 
 I used Brown Sugar instead of white granulated. It adds a darker, deeper flavor and color.
 Also an addition of something acidic- rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, etc gives a nice contrast to the sugar and helps tenderize the meat.
  I've used this marinade with a oven-stuffer roaster, boneless breasts & shrimp- it is a recipe that I can count on.  Thanks, William

I wish I could give this 10 stars! Better than the bottled stuff! Delish! The only thing I changed was I used brown sugar instead of white. I also used it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Very very yummy! Thank you so much for sharing!

Very simple marinade, delicious results.  I used two chicken breasts and baked for 30 minutes at 350F.  Very moist!

I used boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced.  I doubled the sauce, used half to marinate the chicken, and sauted the chicken in a skillet.  Before serving, I poured the remaining sauce over the chicken and served it over egg noodles.  Husband and three kids loved it!

Another "easy to make, throw in the oven and ignore it till the timer goes off" recipe.
My husband is still raving about it!  If you like a little more flavor to your meat, however,
I'd suggest making a paste of minced garlic and olive oil and rubbing it on the 
meat after gently loosening the skin from the bird.  Then pour the sauce over the bird
and bake it.  One of the best easy recipes I've tried.

This is very wonderful.  I have made it several times now and I always add pineapple juice too..1/2-1 cup. Yumm it never lasts long.  I have used whole chicken cut in half or pieces. This is a Keeper.

I substituted the whole chicken for five 4-6 oz. chicken breasts and cooked for about 25 minutes less.  The recipe came out great.  The chicken almost melts in your mouth!

So simple yet so wonderful! Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and served over rice. Tossed in a few small pineapple chunks. Thank you.

Delicious!!!!
I kept the bird intact and doubled the recipe for the sauce. I marinated it a plastic bag with half of the sauce. then I cooked chicken on a rotisserie for 45 mins and basted it every 10 mins until done (total cooking time:1.5 hours) with the extra sauce I added 1.5 table spoons of corn starch and heated just until thickened for dipping sauce. I served the chicken over rice with steamed veggies! YUMMY!

Omg!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!! I'm a very picky eater but I loved this recipe! It reminds me a lot of the teriyaki sauce at Wingstop! The only thing i did was ease up just a little on the soy sauce to avoid it being too salty, and added about 2teaspoons of pineapple juice and layed a fresh pineapple on top of my chicken breast. Happy eating!!

This was really good. I put some broccoli florets in with the sauce and chicken when I marinated it and the broccholi soaked up some of the juice and gave it a good flavor. Very good!

I made this recipe using brown sugar instead of sugar also and it was absolutely fantastic!  I live in a world of picky eaters and even they had seconds.  I used chicken tenders and cut them up and served over rice.

This recipe was super delicious.  I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts (there was PLENTY of marinade), used brown sugar instead of white, and grated about a 3 inch by 1 inch piece of fresh ginger root (the ginger is the key to this recipe) plus I added a teaspoon or so of lemon juice (the bottled juice).   I found the recipe shortly before dinner time so I had JUST 3 hours to marinade it and that timing was absolutely fine.    I cooked the chicken at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes, basting 2 or 3 times during baking.  Make sure that you pour the marinade in the cooking dish along with the chicken...if people experience lack of flavor, it may be because they just took the chicken out of the marinade and placed it in the dish.  My husband, children and I absolutely enjoyed this dish.  It was reminiscent of the chicken with ginger sauce from the local japanese restaurant.    This recipe is a definite keeper in our household.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a good recipe. I used chicken breasts, sliced and marinated over night, then I pan fried with a little bit of veggie oil. I recently learned that Mirin is whats used in authentic Japanese teriyaki. It is basically a honey rice wine, so you can substitute sake and honey or sugar. I'm cooking for myself this week so I'll be making this maybe 3 more times at least with some rice and brocolli. I love onions so I like to add onion powder to the marinade. And you definitely need some sort of acid with any marinade, sake, lemon, rice wine vinegar... whatever you like! You can use the left over marinade to make a delicious teriyaki sauce in a sauce pan.

Very easy recipe.  My boyfriend LOVED it, but I found it just a little too sweet.  Next time around I may reduce the sugar a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

I did as most said and added chunky pineapples on top of the chicken.  I also added the juice from the pineapples to the sauce.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of low sodium soy sauce (doubling the sauce) and after 1 1/2 hour after cooking I kicked up the heat to about 400 degrees to caramelize.   Turned out great!

I just made this recipe and it turned out excellent! My boyfriend gave it 5 stars and asked that we make it again in the future, but i did make some changes. i did not have fresh ginger so i used 2 T of ground instead. Also i always use the minced garlic out of the jar, and i love garlic, so i did about 4-5 T of that. It did not end up too salty like a lot of the other reviewers said theirs did, so maybe that helped.

Recipe turned out great, but the instructions don't make sense.  Is it really necessary to preheat the oven for three hours?

This recipe is great! Thank you for posting. I added double the amount of garlic and ginger just for fun. Tasted great. Cut chicken breasts into strips. Only used half of the prepare sauce to marinade my chicken for 3 hours. Cooked chicken strips in a skillet making sure the pieces weren't touching or saturated in the juices as not to boil them. Allowed the marinade to caramelize around the chicken as it cooked. Took the remaining marinade (that I put aside earlier) and reduced it in a sauce pan till it was slightly syrupy. Drizzled over the cooked chicken strips and served with rice. Yummy.

Seriously the best chicken I've ever made. I used low sodium soy sauce, splenda, doubled the ginger and garlic, added 1 tbls of lemon juice, and chopped green onion. Marinated my boneless skinless chicken breasts overnight, and when it was time to bake, I put foil down on my pyrex and dumped the whole thing in. Baked for 45 minutes.  I know people hate a ton of changes, but I never would've gotten the idea to do all this if it wasn't for this recipe. So, thank you, William for this delicious, easy, healthy recipe!

This recipe is awesome the way it is but I don't feel comfortable using that much sugar. Next time I will decrease the amount.  I'm keeping this recipe close by.

This is a very good basic recipe.  And if my children will eat it, then it's a keeper.  I used brown sugar instead of white granulated, boneless skinless thighs instead of a whole chicken because we don't care for white meat, and ground ginger instead of fresh since that's all I had on hand.  I also added probably three more garlic cloves since we love garlic in my house, and I added about a teaspoon of sesame oil for some added flavor.  Baked the chicken for probably 45 minutes and served over white rice with broccoli and carrots on the side and used the sauce over everything.  Yum!

I use 1/2 Cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce, 2 TBSP of fresh grated ginger and 2 TBSP lemon juice. I use it as a marinade for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. It's so simple and tasty, and neither too sweet nor salty! Everyone loves it. Goes great with rice and veggies.

Excellent!! I have used this recipe with a 4lb chicken (cut into four large pieces). I have followed the exact marinade recipe, but have also substituted the sugar for honey and used low-sodium soy sauce. Cutting the chicken into pieces makes a HUGE difference with how moist your chicken can be! Guests LOVE this chicken!!

Very tasty! I thought this wouldn't turn out because the sauce was thin and the meat didn't look glazed, but I think that's because I used boneless skinless thighs. At the last 5 mins of cooking I broiled the meat in the oven. I also used gluten free soy sauce. I thought this was not too salty or too sweet. I did however think there was something missing...but I used dried ginger, next time I will add more ginger, I only used 1/2 teaspoon.

This was an awesome dish, I have 2 roommates that are the pickiest people on the planet and even they loved it.  I did substitute chicken breasts and I didn't have 3 hours to marinate so I just baked the breasts in the sauce for an hour and it turned out perfect, what a great and easy dish.  A definate repeater.

This was absolutely awesome!  I made a few changes.  I added a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice (as one of the reviews suggested), and I used brown sugar.  I didn't have enough time to allow the chicken to marinate for three hours.  I cooked it after an hour, and the chicken was still full of flavor (next time, time permitting, I'll marinate longer).  I cooked it on top of the stove using some of the marinade. I used chicken thighs, and cut it up for a chicken teriyaki salad.  This so so so good.   I'll be preparing this again very soon!!!

I made this with bottled teriyaki sauce and chicken breasts last week, and it was phenomenal. So tonight I thought I'd give the actual recipe a try. The chicken is tender, but it's like I'm licking a salt lick. Maybe it would be better with reduced sodium soy sauce, but even then the soy flavour overwhelms everything else and this tastes nothing like teriyaki. Not for me.

This was so easy and so good! I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and I only had ground ginger so i used 1/2 tablespoon. I also mixed in a little pineapple juice for basting and topped the chicken off with some pineapple slices. Served w/ brown rice and broccoli and used to leftover juice to put over the rice. I can't wait to have this again!

I made a few changes to the recipe such as 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar, next time I'll only use 1/4 cup because my bf found it too sweet.  I also used 1/2 cup of orange juice, as recommended by someone else's review and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger instead of the fresh ginger.  I found the orange juice gave it a slightly different taste, but I enjoyed it.  I also added 1 cup of broccoli, 1 cup of carrots and 1 cup of celery to it.

Great marinade, but too much sugar for me.  I made it a second time with a little less sugar (I think a little less than 1/2 cup), and it was just perfect!  I didn't have fresh ginger on hand the second time so I used powdered, it came out really well anyway!  It's also good on chicken pieces and on chicken breast.  I think it would be a good grilled chicken, too!

very flavorful and very easy.  The only difference was the substitution of breasts for the whole chicken.  I also boiled the marinade, adding a little bit more brown sugar and some pineapple juice for a sauce.  I will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I used three large boneless, skinless chicken breasts which I cut into small pieces prior to baking.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of soy sauce.  Baked for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  A keeper for me!

I made this and it was a HIT!  I didn't have any garlic on hand so instead used garlic powder.  I also altered the recipe by coating with honey too.

I also used brown (palm) sugar, cutting back to 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 cup orange juice, 3 cloves garlic and 2 TB fresh ginger.  Skewered and barbecued, this is one of my new favorite meals for guests!

Tasted pretty good. We would have liked it more if the sauce was thicker. If I were to try it again, perhaps brown sugar & some lemon juice might improve it.

In all honesty,  I haven't tried this yet.  I will be making it on Friday.  However, a note to everyone.  The saltiness could be due to the chicken.  Most chickens are injected with a saline solution.  Make sure the chicken you buy and use is not injected with saline.

I just made this tonight.  It was the most authentic tasting (restaurant like) dish I've ever made.  Everyone loved it and the kids went back for more.  I served it with Jasmine rice and fresh green beans with lemon zest, olive oil and filberts.  Super yummy!  Thanks.

I loved these! I made them for my graduation party and they where gone in the first five minutes! I used brown sugar instead of what it says, I figured that it would stick and marinate better. And it did, it was amazing! Make them once a month now.

My husband made this for dinner tonight.  DELICIOUS!!  He used a jumbo pack of chicken legs and baked it in the oven since it was raining.  This is a new family favorite.  Forget spending money at Buffalo Wild Wings...we'll make our own!!

This was really great; my family loved it. I made a few changes. I used less sugar, rather than 3/4 I used 2/4. Next time, because there will be a next time. I think that I will double the sauce. My family wanted more, which didn't surprise me. I thought about doubling it, but decided to see how it would go following the recipe. 

I served this with white rice, peas, and corn. I also fried some pineapple rings with a carrot to add a little more color and decoration. My family wanted more pineapple as well. 

I wish I would have taken a picture, but I forgot and my family was hungry. The whole meal was very economical. I have a family of 4, and everything was all under 20 dollars; and we have leftover rice and veggies. The chicken was so great there's none leftover. I did want to have leftover chicken for bento, but there isn't any. I typically cook 2lbs of chicken, and there's leftovers for lunch or the dogs, but 3lbs this time and it's all gone. 

All in all I gave it 5 stars. I thought it was very easy to make. It's something that will be made a lot in the future.

This was delicious. I used brown sugar instead of white, added a small can of diced pineapple, and the juice of 1 lemon. The pineapple is a must, it really adds a lot of flavour and juiceiness! Will definitely be making again!

As it cooked even after I marinated, I noticed a bit of dryness going on. So I added a tblspn of sugar and slowly sprinkled on the meat. I added teriyaki sauce. I also added a sprinkle of cinn and sug. Then I cooked and when about done I removed some juice, and mixed with honey. It melts the honey, then add it back to the chicken. By the way, I'd cook it at 400 for 1.5hrs, skin facing up. Neighbors bang my door down when they smell it now....Enjoy :)

The best home made teriyaki chicken ever!. I changed the whole chicken for boneless skinless breasts and after marinated it for 1.5 hours (I was in a rush) I sliced them "fajita style" and cooked them on olive oil. Served them with brown rice. Delicious and very nutriitious

Just a few changes replaced the granulated sugar with brown sugar and used 2/4 soy sauce instead of 3/4 because I like it sweater. Great recipe and easy to make.

I am shocked that this recipe had such a high rating.  Either people's salt tolerance is way too high or there were a lot changes made to the recipe.  This was extremely salty, even with low sodium soy sauce.  And all I could taste was the salt and soy sauce, so I probably would never name this "teriyaki" since I could not taste that.  There needs to be some other seasoning.  Marinating the chicken probably would help. I ended up with so much thin sauce that I actually ended up using it as a base for my stir fry vegetables (diluted so it wouldn't be so salty).   Definitely will not be making this again.

Simple, easy, and wonderful. We used skinless chicken for a lighter result, and the flavor was still amazing. This was my first experience with ginger root, and after a bit of Googling I found that all I needed to do was peel off the outer covering and grate the root, then freeze the remaining portion in a baggie for later use. Simple! The fresh ginger really makes the recipe, I think.

One of the best chicken recipes I've tried!  It work great with just chicken breasts as well if you only have a couple of people to cook for; you just have to lower the cooking time to about 30 minutes.  This is definitely one to make as often as you can.

This recipes ended up being a bit too salty for me.  However the rest of the family loved it!  I think I would cut down on the soy sauce a bit and probably change the sugar to be brown sugar like the other people suggested next time.

I used 3/4 C packed brown sugar instead of white, 1/3 teaspoon of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon ground ginger and 3/4 C Soy sauce.  I used 3 skinless chicken  breast, covered the chick w/the marinade, put in the fridge and left for about 5 hours. I placed in pan to cook and the sauce came about 1/2 way up the chicken so I turned every 12 minutes and cooked for 1 hour.  After removing chicken from pan I poured the sauce in a pan and thickened with cornstarch and used as dipping sauce. This is absolutely awesome.  Perfect. Delicious!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH for the recipe. Love it!

I used chicken breasts cut into strips.  My mom offered to help me marinate the chicken since she doesn't trust me with raw meat and she added 4 cloves of garlic and A LOT of ginger!  Even though those flavors were a little overwhelming, I could tell that the original flavors would have been awesome!  I baked the breasts at 350 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.  There were no leftovers!

Great recipe!  I love that it's so easy and has ingredients that I have around all the time anyway.  I've made it twice so far (once for guests who gave it rave reviews), once with bone-in, skin-on chicken quarter pieces, and another time with skinless boneless chicken breasts.  You just have to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Teriyaki sauce is so easy to make, it's a wonder more people don't do it from scratch!  This is basically the same recipe that my family has passed down, but if you want something a little different, try throwing in a tablespoon of aji mirin (sweet cooking rice wine) or sub brown sugar and add a tablespoon or two of apricot brandy... this one's my favorite and especially good on chicken wings!

Wonderful! We marinated it for two days before cooking & loved it. Be sure to baste a lot though. (At least once every ten minutes!) Also, with all that basting, expect the baking time to be 1 1/2 hours.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It has become part of my regular favorites.  It's so easy to prepare.  I prepare it the night before and marinate overnight.  The next day just stick it in the oven when I get home from work.  Usually serve it with white rice.

Wow! I'm very impressed with this. I swaped out the granulated sugar and replaced it with brown sugar, let it all marinate for 1 hour, and baked as stated. Also, I used chicken breast rather than a whole chicken. I only needed about 42 minutes in a 13 by 9 inch dish at 350 uncovered, and it came out perfect! I also just dumped the contents (marinade and all) from my ziplock bag into the dish and spread it out.  This is delicious restaurant quality!!

I tried this recipe tonight for the first time, and, although I was so excited about it, the chicken didn't turn out as I had hoped. The marinade was over-the-top salty! It was so sodium-packed that my mom and I were not able to finish our chicken breast! I know I must have done something wrong because everyone else seems to love this recipe. Could someone please let me know what I may have done wrong? Should I have used "low-sodium" soya sauce?

This recipe just looks so good - I'd like to know how to make it right!

Thanks!

This is my first review, so bear with me. I absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was so easy and delicious. I added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to it and put it in the crock-pot for three hours. The chicken tasted amazing! My family couldn't get enough. We will definitely be making this again in the near future.

A little too salty (and I like salt), even with a little pineapple juice to cut it some. Next time will use low sodium Soy Sauce. Otherwise, great and easy!

Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the white and added some pineapple juice. Marinated chicken breasts. It was perfect.

Great Sauce. I used it to marinate stripped beef for a Teriyaki Broccoli and Beef dish. It's sweet, but that's how I like it. (The only change I made was using ginger powder instead of the fresh stuff.)

This is soooo easy and my boys (ages 4 and 7) LOVE this. They compare it to Sanku chicken we get in the mall. I've made it multiple times and turns out great each time.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (used bon-in chicken breast) and my children loved it and so did I of course. I followed a suggestion of other viewers, I used brown sugar, made the egg noodles and second batch of teriyaki sauce. The second batch I cooked in a small sauce pan and added a slurry to thicken it and it turned out great! I will definitely make again, but will use the low sodium soy sauce. This was a hit! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This chicken was SOOOOOOO good!!!! :) :) :) I made it with white rice with the sauce over the rice too after it cooked. The KEY to this is using a bulb baster while the chicken is cooking BE sure to do this evern 15 or so minutes in order to get the most flavor in the chicken!!! five stars for sure!!!! :)

Soooooo delicious! I found my recipe card and here are the notes that i added:
-mandatory to marinade for 3+ hours
-Double the mixture for rice
-add dash of lemon juice to counteract slightly strong teriyaki
-rub garlic and olive oil paste on bird under skin as other review said.

Loved it! The only change i made was using ground ginger and garlic powder. Next time I'll cut it bite sized and let it marinate and the pan fry it. I'll also use a mix of white and dark meat.

Update May 11th 2014: Used whole chicken today and prepared exactly as directed - cooked for 1 1/4 hours and it still wasn't done.  Had to microwave pieces for dinner.  Was okay but very greasy. I couldn't eat my portion. Not the recipe's fault probably but next time, will try buying chicken somewhere else first. A lot of prep time and effort for something I couldn't eat. Previous review: Really quite good.  Prepared exactly as directed, no changes except used chicken legs with backs attached and chicken was very flavorful and moist.  Will do this one again.  Thanks!

Fantastic.  I used boneless chicken thighs.  Brown sugar like many others had recommended.  I also added some apple cider vinegar, a splash of lemon juice and black pepper.  No time to marinade so just mixed all the ingedients together and poured over chicken thighs and baked in the oven for 1 hour at 375.  It was amazingly delicious and super easy!

Turned out exactly as i imagined! Never knew i was capable of making my own teriyaki chicken! Recommended by the previous reviews, i used brown sugar which i think really complements the rich taste of the soy sauce! I also added abit of chilli flakes and mixed herbs to just add alittle kick to it and it tasted great! my boyfriend loves it and I look forward to making this again! CHeers to the recipe!

this was good - i used chicken breasts (skinless & boneless)  instead of a whole chicken, perhaps thats whu it's not getting a higher score,  but it still had a nice taste - should have marinated it longer perhaps

YUM! Thank you for a simple recipe. I didn't have fresh ginger and garlic on hand, so what I used was powdered. I just added 3 teaspoons or so ( like the garlic taste) also, I ended up adding pineapple juice about 1.5 cups. I only had 3 chicken breast so pounded them out with my rolling pin, cut them up into chunks, cooked the sauce and the chicken in one pan, had basmati rice, and frozen oriental veggies. Was enough to feed hubby, 2 toddlers and one hungry teen. Next time I will double this recipe! Thank you soo much :)

This was AWESOME!!!  I cut up a whole chicken and used about 1/2 cup soy with some chicken broth, also like others used brown suger.  Once done, I cooked the remaining marinade with cornstarch and poured over veggies and brown rice-can't wait for the leftovers!!

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  This is the best teriyaki sauce I have ever had and will never by bottled again. This would be great with steak,  shrimp - whatever.  I didn't have enough time to marinate the chicken so I just cooked immediately and it was awesome.  I can't wait to marinate overnight because I'm sure it will be that much better.  The onlly recommendation I have is to double the sauce because you will want some extra on your dish!

Actually came across this recipe today looking for a something new for the chicken I planned on cooking for dinner. Since I found it late in the day it only marinated for about 2hrs...but still had LOTS of flavor. Like other reviewers I used brown sugar instead of granulated and I also used bone in chicken breasts...YUMMY also I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the skin...My 3yr old who NEVER eats his dinner asked for 2nds...This is a keeper!! Thanks

Delicious!  I took the advice of others and used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and added about 1 Tablespoon lemon juice.  I also used two big chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I cut the chicken into strips and cooked in a saucepan (only took about 10 minutes).  I made it into a teriyaki bowl- rice, with stir fried veggies on top, then the chicken.  I used the leftover marinade to make a sauce which I poured over everything, then sprinkled on some roasted sesame seeds.  Everyone loved it...even my 3 year old!

This was awesome!  I didn't have enough sugar in the house so I used 3/4 the amount of honey instead of sugar and it was yummy.

Overall, I think is a great recipe.I really did not make any changes; although, I did not feel the need to use 3 cloves of garlic so I only used 1. The taste was great, and will make this recipe again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made extra sauce as suggested, used a combination of brown and white sugar, added a dash of lemon juice and olive oil, marinated in a plastic bag for an hour.  I poured the whole thing in a square baking dish to cook in the juices and flipped it over after 20 minutes, and again after 10 minutes, and broiled for a few minutes.  I had some white rice from the night before so I decided to fry it with butter and a couple scoops of the sauce.  It was AWESOME.  We will be having this often.

Simple to prepare but I did thicken the sauce with some cornstarch,added some pineapple and used it over broccoli and rice.  I will likely make this again.

Made the following substitutions because I am an indigent college student:

table sugar, 2 month old ginger root (minced), Garlic cloves that come chopped up in that clear plastic container.  Added cornstarch to the sauce to make it thicker.  

It was wondeful!  I marinated the gizzard overnight in its juices.  I basted it about 3 times toal at 20 minute increments.  

It came out fall off the bone and quite succulent.  The next day when eating the leftovers I decided to pull all the meat off the chicken and stir fry it in its own sauce.  OMIGOD!  That was delicious.  The water evaporates and the flavors go into the gizzard chunks.  Very tasty!  And chicken turns a brown color so it looks like the stir-fry terriyaki chicken from the restaurants.    

It was better than those little pieces of chicken on the end of a toothpick that they offer as free samples at the food court of the mall.  

Miked this with the recipe for Chinese chicken fried rice (using brown rice) on allrecipes.com and it was irresistable!  

And for those on a diet that dont like to stir-fry cuz they are fat, keep in mind that I did not add oil but used just the same sauce to stir-fry the chicken so it is as healthy as can be.

Simple and tasty.  I usually add more ginger and garlic for extra kick.  The sauce is versatile and is also good over broiled salmon.

This was good, but it was also salty.  I didn't marinade it whatsoever, I just threw it in the oven and it flavored the chicken nicely (just make sure you seperate the skin from the meat so it marinates it while cooking).  Anyhow, good recipe, just use low sodium soy.

This is an AWESOME and SIMPLE recipe...couldn't believe a recipe kept so short and simple could taste so good.  This was my first time making teriyaki chicken and my bf asked where I got the recipe because he says this is a definate keeper.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This came out perfect!  My husband and I both loved it.  I am a newlywed, and his was my first experience cooking a whole bird.  Can you believe I never "basted" before?  The ingredients were easy, and the outcome was yummy!

This turned out wonderful!!  Everyone in the family ate it!  I changed the following:  Instead of 3/4 cup of sugar, I did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 of brown sugar.  I also marinated it for a couple of hours before I cooked it.  Hubs said that it wasn't the over bearing teriyaki flavor that we normally get.  

This is definitely going on the make again list.

I made the marinade the night before and let the chicken marinade over night. I didn't have ginger, so it wasn't included in the dish. I also season the chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

I thought the chicken was alright, my boyfriend loved it (I guess that means I'll be making it again). Its defintely better than, what they serve in the bottle at the grocery stores.

This was wonderful. I used brown sugar instead of white and added about half a cup of orange juice. It was delicious served with brown rice and the Sugared Asparagus from this site.

I didn’t have any fresh ginger on hand, so I used 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. I also used brown sugar instead of white. Instead of a whole chicken, I used 3 chicken quarters and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.

With those changes, the recipe turned out really great. I definitely plan to make it again, although I’ll probably use a skinless chicken cut instead.

Yum! Used brown sugar and added some rice wine vinegar. I cut my chicken into pieces and marinaded in a Ziploc bag for about four hours.  Stir fried some vegetables and served with rice. Nice dinner!

I was skeptical about this one. The family and I can not get enough of this. Even the person who dislikes chicken in my house wants more. Brown sugar made the recipe better. Great recipe.

This recipe was so easy to make and the outcome was very delicious my boyfriend loved it. The only change i made was using a low sodium soy sauce.

Following the review of LIZ5 I made a couple of changes. First used brown sugar instead of white, and added some red wine vinegar. The chicken was tender and moist the flavor was great even to the point of be addicted.. As some reviewers said much better than the store bought. Taste like the teriyaki in the Chinese restaurants. Perfect to try it on steak strips on a skewer. Without the changes 5 stars, with the changes 10 stars. Even my DH who keeping saying he does not like Chinese food like it.

This has got to be the best and easiest chicken I have ever made. I was impressed with the flavor and think that it would be a good recipe for young teens to learn to make. Beautiful!

I've used this recipe for a long time now.  I also use brown sugar and I also add sliced onion to the marinade.  If possible, try and marinate over night, you'll be glad you did.  Also great for beef teriyaki

Awesome Chicken! I used boneless chicken breast, honey (rather than sugar) and more garlic. I cooked on my indoor grill, basting quite often. This is the most flavorful, tender chicken. My family couldn't stop raving. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I cooked 2kg of chicken thighs for a party. I followed the recipe but used brown sugar instead of white (as suggested). I popped it into the oven for 35min at 175 degrees celcius, skin up. It turned out very very good. My friends loved it. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Thanks!

This recipe is delicious. My boyfriend absolutely loves chicken, so I am always on the look out for new recipes. I use a mixture of the granulated and soft brown sugars, and it glazes beautifully. Also I buy the chicken quartered instead of halved.

Excellent.  I used frozen chicken breast and put in crock pot for about four hours on low.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and added water.  It was very tender and flavorful.  Served over rice cooked in chicken broth.

I LOVE marinating chicken breasts in this sauce, grilling on my Foreman, slicing, and eating in a salad with an Asian dressing!  The only change I make is brown sugar instead of white. Oh, and if you marinate, DON'T marinate overnight. I did that once, and the chicken was TOUGH!

Very good and simple recipe. I used legs with thighs and didn't have time to marinate. Also, was out of fresh garlic so used garlic powder Still came out tender and very flavorful.

I made a few changes to this recipe. I did not have time to marinate and only had leg & thighs on hand. I seasoned my meat with ground ginger, garlic powder & black pepper. Then I browned the meat in a little oil. I placed the chicken in my roaster at 375 and cooked it in the marinade for 1 1/2 hrs while basting several times. I doubled the sauce but I did not double the soy sauce or sugar but added more water to it. I feared it would be too salty, even using reduced sodium soy sauce. It was not, but a little too sweet. I used brown sugar & the color was great. My family would love for me to make this again minus a little sugar.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used pieces of cut up chicken, legs, thighs and 1 breast, instead of a whole chicken cut in half. Marinated the pieces in a plastic bag. Baked the chicken uncovered and basted as directed. However, since I used cut up chicken pieces, I was afraid the meat might get too dry, so half way through the cooking, I tented the baking dish, loosely, with foil. Wow! Moist yet the chicken stayed on the bone.

This was very good.  I used 5 boneless/skinless chicken breasts that I cut into bite size cubes, doubled the marinade so that I would have extra to pour over my steamed rice and baked in a casserole dish at 350 for about 45-50 minutes.  This is a great easy recipe.  I think I will make it again adding either some orange juice concentrate or fresh lemon juice for a sweeter citrus flavor and maybe some cornstarch to thicken it for more of a gravy-like marinade.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This definitely gets 5 stars from us.  We love teriyaki and now that we have found a recipe we like, we won't be buying take out any more.  Quote from my husband, "WOW... HOLY COW... THIS IS EXCELLENT" and I could barely keep him from stealing the chicken while I was dishing up the plates.  Like many other users suggested, I used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken and cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.

I don't eat meat, but the bf *loved* this one.  He said that it tastes like his favorite Japanese restaurant chicken.  I did make the changes of using only chicken breasts and then, obviously, cooking them for less time.

Very good.  I'm happy to find such a tasty teriyaki recipe.  I marinated it about 5 hours, perhaps, and then baked it for about 45 minutes, and broiled it for an additional 15 for some crunch.  (I used bone-in chicken thighs).  I boild the marinade and poured it over the top for a scrumptious finish.

This dish is absolutely delicious.  The only liberty I took, William, was to add one sliced green bell pepper and a small can of pineapple chunks, drained, during the last 1/2 hour of baking time.  And, very importantly for working folks, I was able to prepare the chicken in the marinade on my lunch break and then put it in the oven when I got home.  This is quite economical and quick to prepare.  Thank you, William

This sauce was excellent though I didn't exactly use it like the recipe said.  I made the following substitutions:  granular Splenda for the sugar and dry ginger (1/2 the measurement) for the fresh.  We served this over grilled tilapia and brown rice.  My fiance gave it a 10/10 and was amazed at how it tied the meal together.  I will definitely be making this again!

YUMMY!!!  You know it's good if all 4 kids love it and they did.  I used chicken breasts and it was so easy.  I think I'll try using tenders next time so even more of the sauce cooks in.

Bill, my family loved your teriyaki recipe. I added a little bit of rice wine, and rice wine vinegar, and a touch of garlic chili paste. It was fabulous. We also grilled the chicken on the bbq. I doubled your sauce so there was some for marinating, and basting and some for drizzling over the thighs with rice. Mmmmm. Thanks Bill!

Awesome! Better than any store bought teriyaki sauce. I actually did mine with breasts. Same amount of sugar and soy sauce. A little less ginger and garlic. Worked perfectly.

I will make this again! The kids really liked it too. I will serve over rice and may make more sauce next time. The flavor is quite a bit stronger the second day. Next time, I would dilute the sauce with water. The kids loved the flavor the first day but thought it was too strong the second day.

It was good.  Better than store bought due to much less salty taste.  I wouldn't say it was as amazing as all of the reviews though.  I would make again, but modify with pineapple and honey maybe.  It would be good to mix with veggies in a stir fry.

I also used brown sugar instead of white.  My husband likes "moisture" in all his meats, so I marinaded thighs then cooked them in the marinade until they were 165 degrees.  Extremely flavorful and moist enough for hubby.

This recipe was amazing! My family is pretty picky about their teriyaki sauce. I have not found a bottled version that we like. This is a definite keeper! I doubled the recipe, used low sodium soy sauce and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I baked in a pan. When the chicken was done, I took it out of the pan. I stirred into the sauce 2 tablespoons of cornstarch which I had stirred in cold water first. I cranked up the heat to 400 degrees and let it boil till it thickened. It mad a fabulous sauce to put over the chicken and rice. So fantastic. Next time I'm going to try with pineapple and add some acid as suggested. But as is, it's delicious. I wonder how it would taste with a flank steak?

I like to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for this recipe. I also like to grill the chicken instead of baking. This has become one of my family's favorite meals.

Finally the perfect, easy recipe  for Teriyaki Chicken. I used chicken fajitas cut them in thin strips and stir fried them. I also used brown sugar instead of the granulated it called for. My son loved it.

Easy and Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was finger licking good!  Next time I'll try it with brown sugar as per other reviewers suggestions just to change it up a bit.
PS:  Made it again with cut up chicken legs and brown sugar and equally delish!

So SIMPLE and taste great!  Modifications: opted out using the ginger (had none lying around) and used 1-2 tbsp of ketchup. Marinated for 3 hrs and chicken came out moist with flavorful skin.

M husband was skeptical about this recipe while I was preparing it, but when he tasted it, he assured me that this teriyaki chicken recipe was a keeper. Delicious. Use lots of garlic and ginger and it is even better.

Holy cow...easy and tasty.  I had chicken that was going to expire and we love ginger - so I typed in the keywords chicken and ginger and this is what I got.  The whole family loved it, and the cooking temperature and time were spot-on.  We served on rice with a veg and everyone was happy.  Wish I would have doubled the recipe so I could have had leftovers!

Very good - just a tad bit too salty. Will try half regular and half low sodium soy sauce next time. It was so easy. I used brown sugar(per other reviews) and skinless chicken thighs. l loved it so much I was licking my fingers!!!

Rarely do I bother to rate anything, especially 5 stars, but this recipe is really super. I did this quickly before I went to work in the morning.  As with most people, I made my own changes. **measurements are approximate** I used 1/2 cup of honey (healthier than white sugar), 3/4 soy sauce, 2 Tbsp of fresh grated ginger root and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Marinated whole chicken in a 2 1/2 qt ceramic oval dish, breast down (my fiance & I cannot stand dry breast meat) after making sure every part of it was covered with the mixture inside and out. Covered and stuck it in the fridge for 8-9 hours while I went to work.  After work, I took it out of the fridge, turned it over a couple of times and then stuck it in the oven, breast side down, so that the breast can continuously be basted and forgot about it for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I turned the chicken over and baked for another 15 minutes to get the breast all prettied up.  Served with sauce over rice and sliced cucumbers on the side.   To the people who say there's too much sauce, I say refrigerate it, skim off fat and pour over hot rice in place of soy sauce. Or, keep the fat and use the sauce for stir-fry veggies or egg noodles, eliminating need for more oils. Or, shred up some chicken to make a "chicken au jus sandwich". The possibilities are endless. :)

What a delicious and easy recipe!  I used lite soy and subbed 3/4 c white sugar with 1/2 c of raw sugar.  It was a big hit with the family.  Definitely will try this on the grill and on salmon.

This did not turn out any way like stated. I followed the recipe completely, and I ended up with so much leftover sauce! I was turning and basting chicken often and still didn't come out with a glaze. I'm not really sure what I did wrong, but my husband seems to think that it called for way too much soy sauce. I'm not sure if I will make this again or not.

Yummo!! My oldest son requested chicken teriyaki and white rice for dinner and I chose this recipe. He loved it as did the rest of the family. I doubled the sauce marinated chicken in 3/4 of it and used the 1/4 to cook some stir fry veggies in and added a cornstarch slurry towards the end of cooking. Served the veggies and chicken over white rice. A perfectly sweet recipe!!

I made this yesterday for my husband and 7-year old son and they could not get enough!!  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts pounded to 1/2 inch thick, used 3/4 cup pineapple juice as reviewers suggested.  Dumped chicken and marinade in 9X13 glass pan..make sure to baste a few times.  Cooked at 375 for 30-35minutes...I was short on time.  It turned out PERFECT.  Next time I will consider dicing chicken after it cooks, thickening sauce, and serving over Jasmine rice.  Thanks!!!

I've been making this recipe for years, except I always add a small can of pineapple chunks along with its juice (or fresh if I have it on hand) and a few slices of green bell pepper. The pineapple juice cuts down on the saltiness and gives it a sweeter taste. I also serve it with rice because the juices give the rice a yummy flavor.

I made the sauce and thickened it up with some corn starch.  Then, I steamed broccoli and carrots and mixed them together with some strips of chicken and it was SO GOOD! I am watching my weight/sugar intake and it was better than something from the bottle.

This made a delicious sauce for a stir-fry. Next time I make it, I think I'll replace the garlic cloves with powder. I felt that it was a little too garlicy (this coming from a garlic lover).

Really, really good. Elegantly simple, fast to prep, etc... Next time, I may just separate all the pieces so each will absorb more of the yummy sauce.

I halved the sugar and doubled the ginger and used low sodium soy sauce after reading reviews. Great!! I used a trick because we do not eat the skin. I separated the skin from the meat with a sharp knife like a pocket, and put the marinade inside, then speared the skin back on with skewers(clipped off the long ends). When baking I peeled the skins back the last 25 minutes and basted so the skin did not get dry. The meat got all the flavor that way.

This was a fantastic sauce and I can't wait to try it on Salmon, I think that would be great.  I used chicken thighs but I cut them in half the long way and then put them on skewers, propped them up in the roaster and both sides got nice and sticky...YUMMMY  my son loved them.  Chicken on a stick!

This teriyaki chicken recipe is amazing! We had it for lunch and the whole family couldn't stop raving about it.  I did take the advice of other members and I used brown sugar instead of white and I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated them overnight and cooked them on 350 for 40 minutes.  It was perfect!

Good recipe but a lot of sodium. I used low sodium soy sauce and added a little less than the recipe asked for. I also used brown sugar and some lemon juice as suggested. Served with brown rice and steamed vegetables.

This recipe was excellent! And it was so incredibly easy to make. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead and marinated them for 4 hours. I baked them for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Turned out delicious and will definitely be making this dish again and again in the future!

this is the best teriyaki chicken i have ever had. I didn't have ginger so i used honey. When i baked it I also added pineapple in the pan. It came out wonderful. I made white rice with it but instead of using two cups of water to biol the rice i used 1/2 cup of the teriyaki sause and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice with 1 cup of water. i was the perfect combonation. Better then going out to eat!!

A great favorite with me and my husband.  We increased the ginger by a half and let the chicken marinate over night for best flavor. We also usually make an whole seperate version of the sauce to add to the chicken afterward and to add to rice. Note the chicken cooks to an odd brownish color, but tastes great!!  Great with rice and broccoli!

Mmmm mmmmm delicious! The only change I made was using brown sugar instead of white as others had suggested. I'll definitely be making this one again, thanks for the recipe.

I've had enough chicken lately, so I
tried this on country style ribs.
Thank you, sir.  I love teriyaki, and 
this is "WOW!" delicious.
  Thanks, again, William.

Very good!!! I didn't have any ginger, I added a tsp of red vinegar, and used brown sugar instead of white. I also didn't have time to marinate my chicken breasts, which I only cooked for 35 minutes. The chicken was fabulous! It was so moist and delicious, I will definitely make this again!

My Hubby and I really really loved this recipe.  I did make changes since I didn't have enough ingredients.  I added a Tbs. or so of apple vinegar, and I used ground ginger since I did not have the fresh.  Usually when I make any chicken my husband needs "sauce" on the side, but this time he did not!

This sauce is just to die for!  It reminds me of one of my favorite Hawaiian restaurants' teriyaki chicken, so tender and flavorful!  I used 2 chicken breasts and cut the recipe in half.  Threw it on top of some white rice and was amazing!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of  adjustments that I made. With the adjustments, I would rate it a 5star. Took someones suggestion of using brown sugar instead and skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut up. Something else missing so I added water chestnuts. It is a keeper!!!!

This was the first time I made my own teriyaki sauce...I usually just use something out of a bottle. No longer! This was so simple and delicious! A little less sugar next time...it was a little too sweet for me. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband liked this.  I thought it was okay.  I had to cook the chicken a little longer than 1 hour.  I also think I might turn up the temperature a bit to get the skin a little crispy.

Delicious! I used brown sugar as well, and 3 large frozen chicken breasts - baked at 350 for 55 minutes and they came out perfectly moist and flavorful.  Yum!

Great recipe. I changed the sugar ratio though.
I love brown sugar, so I used 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1/2cup brown sugar. Worked great, but that's just another option!

good flavor but a little too salty. 
After reading the reviews, I tried the recipe as written but with out the cornstarch. It was too salty, so I boiled a raw peeled potato in the sauce to reduce the saltiness. I then mixed the cornstarch and water and added it to thicken the sauce.

After reading all of the great reviews I was very disappointed in my meal.  There just wasn't enough flavor.  It just needed more of something.  I won't be trying this again.

I thought it needed something more so I though the pineapple juice and brown sugar idea would help minimize a strong soy flavor, but it didn't. It was just too much. I think it needs something else, but I am not sure what.

This is a very wonderful recipe. I loved the flavor it gave the chicken. I did overcook it a little bit leaving my chicken a little dry. I will pay more attention next time. will make again.

This is really good!  I used about 1.5 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken and marinaded it in 1/2 the sauce for a few hours and then  I sauted it in a pan on the stove.  I simmered the remaining sauce on the stove over low heat to warm and thicken just slightly.  I served the warm sauce with the chicken for dipping.  It was delicious!

Tasted great!! Used chicken breasts that only marinaded about 1.5 hours before I grilled them on the BBQ pit. Worked out perfect! Thanks!

This was a great recipe, I modified it for what I had. I combined the sauce in a saucepan and boiled it (used brown sugar instead of white) for about 5 minutes, then added chopped cooked chicken breast and stirred it over the heat for about 5 minutes. It gave the chicken the nice teriyaki flavor and the sauce was nice and syrupy. Next time I may use low sodium soy sauce or less of it b/c it was pretty salty. Thanks!

I just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts for this.  I added a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks (with the juice) and let the whole thing marinate overnight.  When it was done baking, I removed the chicken and added a cornstarch slurry to slightly thicken the sauce.  Served over Oven Brown Rice from this site (same temp and cooking time) and had a great, easy weeknight meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted sugar with splenda. It was good but probably would have made the 5 star if I had used real sugar. Don't get me wrong it was really good but could have been better.

I followed someone's suggestion to thicken the sauce and pour over vegetables.  I also used skinless boneless thighs instead of a whole chicken.  I will definitely make this again.  Excellent!

This was great!  I pulled this off the website last night and prepared it for a dinner party we were having, with sushi as the main course and chicken for the kids (4 kids under the age of 5).  It was fast, tasty, and the adults raved about it too.

thanks!

A good, easy recipe.  I thought it was a little sweet for me and will likely use less sugar next time... but in a pinch, a good option.  Thanks!

It was delicious and taste just like teriyaki chicken back home in the island I just twicked it a little and added a little bit of island flava.

Great flavor! Just a little too sweet for my taste. Will reduce sugar next time. Used chicken breast and marinated then cooked on stovetop! Love the fresh ginger and garlic!

Wow what an amazing recipe. I did tweak it a little did not use the white sugar instead I used brown sugar. I also added a whole can of pineapple with the juice. Put all the ingredients with the chicken legs into a turkey bag(Plastic). Let it sit in the refrigerator for about two or three hours. When ready to cook put the bag inside Aluminum tray. When I felt it was good to take out the bag I did and let it continue baking till it was ready. My husband and boys loved it my young one loved it so much he started to pick some off my plate. ?? All in All I will be making it again soon. Was delicious. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with myself and others.

Amazingly easy and SO delicious!!! I use ground ginger and minced garlic from a jar. It literally takes seconds to throw everything into the instant pot. Thirty minutes later I have fantastic teriyaki chicken. I don’t marinade but do cook it this long so it shreds and the flavor is throughout the meat. I double the recipe and triple the sauce so we can have some for dinner and I can put a few freezer meals away for lunches. Won’t ever buy teriyaki sauce again. Great for company too! Everyone LOVES it!!!

I was looking for a Teriyaki recipe and found this one however I didn’t have any ginger so I used an apple instead - threw everything in a bullet blender and marinated in a plastic bag for a couple of hours.  Baked as instructed & it was great!  I will definitely make again & will also try original recipe as well lol!

Delicious! I doubled the sauce so there was lots left over to smother the rice. I didn’t even have time to marinade as the recipe called for and it was very flavourful.

I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used low sodium soy sauce and not as much as recipe calls for. I added just a little bread crumbs on top of chicken. That’s just my preference. It was very easy to make and awesomely delicious!

Wow is this one of the next marinades that I have found on this site. I used a whole chicken and cut it up into the thigh leg wing etc. I put it all in a gallon size bag and let marinate all day. I cooked and basted for one hour and oh boy this chicken is moist, flavorful and has a beautiful brown glaze on it. I used the extra marinade as a dipping sauce. I let it boil down on the stove for about 10’ and added a rouge to thicken it up. It was a little salty but still good. This recipe was soooo delicious that I made it again that same week. Everyone loved it. The only thing I did was add a run consisting of garlic and onion powder, cumin, pepper and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper. I mixed it together and lifted the skin and rubbed the dry ingredients all over the meat. Then laid the skin back on. It really kicks up the chicken a notch and gives it a little spicy sweet bite to your mouth. I also used brown sugar instead of white. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a hit at my house. My fiancé asks for this at least once a week, sometimes twice. I let the chicken marinate in the teriyaki sauce for as long as I possibly can (the longer the better) so it marinates in the fridge for 2 days at least and what a difference it makes! I also use brown sugar. 100% recommend.. so yummy!

Best teryaki sauce recipe I've found so far. I hate buying bottled teriyaki because there's something very artificial about them. This is simple and delicious. The whole family loves it!

Super easy and extremely tasty.  Used a chicken breast, pounded thin and cut into chunks.  One reviewer suggested using brown sugar, which I will try next time, but it was mighty fine as it was.  To break the monotony of left-overs, add some dry-roasted peanuts.  All in all, a can't-go-wrong dish.

This is my go-to recipe for easy terriyaki chicken...the only change I made was using brown sugar instead of granulated sugar...Also added some lemon juice, and some corn starch to reduce the sauce from being so watery.

VERY GOOD.  Entire family of 5 enjoyed it.   I used brown sugar as many suggested and chicken breasts cut in large pieces.   This will be a regular dinner for my crew.

This recipe is very good, and easy to make. Another great recipe with only 5 ingredients, all which I always have on hand. I used brown sugar and a splash of lemon juice. The sauce does come out thin, just thicken it in a saucepan with cornstarch. Freeze the leftover sauce and use as a dipping sauce.

Outstanding!  I used agave nectar as I am trying to avoid sugar, chicken thighs as that is what I had thawed and we grilled it.  I'll definitely keep this in my "recipe box" and fix again.  The entire family liked it.

Wow! This recipe is so easy to prepare and as an experience cook this will be an easy  presentation but as I can see, taste is absolutely great, because I am familiar already with teriyaki by pan and not by oven, so this is great, a great idea for me to try, only to make some innovative with presentation. Great!!!!

Great recipe! Chicken turned out beautiful and tasted great too. I am diabetic so I made a change -- instead of the 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, I used the equivilent in powdered stevia. To those individuals wanting to do the same, it is easier to mix stevia in warm/hot vs. cold. Soooo, heat-up that soy sauce before adding the stevia powder!
Also, I let the chicken marinate for about 8 hours and basted it every 6 to 10 minutes while cooking.

I tried this recipe last night and my family loved it. I added a little bit of rice wine vinegar to the mix and it was great. We cooked it on the Bar-b-que grill and the smokey flavor was excellent.

After reading many reviews, I made several additions/changes to this recipe and therefore, rated one of customized versions that came very close to what I made.....but I wanted to come back to the "mother" recipe and give it a 5 star rating, so others will try it too!  I used 3 pounded boneless skinless breast in a ziplock for marinating. I used brown sugar instead of white.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh, I added a small can of pineapple chunks with the juice, and I added 2 tsp rice wine viegar (makes it very tender).  Baked uncovered at 375 for 45 minutes and cut into bite size pieces so that every piece could be coated with this yummy goodness!!  Pineapple added nice flavor to the marinate, but the Pineapple chunks absorbed a lot of the strong soy flavor and saltiness...I liked that though.   Will make again...with more chicken....while I would normally only serve myself a half of chicken breast, when it is cut up in small pieces and so flavorable, it is easy to eat more than you realize!!!

I made this with chicken breast the only thing is that you probably don't need as much of the sauce mixture if you are gonna use a little over 1 lbs of chicken.  I think next time I'm going to cut this into strips.  Oh also I used a tiny bit of sesame oil

For a more authentic marinade use Miren rice wine with the soy sauce. Its sweet so you may want to cut some of the sugar. If you can't find the Miren locally, substitute with Sake.

Very easy and tasty! I didn't even think I liked teriyaki sauce...and after making this, I will never get packaged stuff again. I put it on chicken breasts. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I used light brown sugar. My ginger measurement wasn't exact either, but I think this is the sort of thing you can add to taste. Served with jasmine rice and (frozen) green peas, this made a great lunch.

I used boneless chicken thigh fillets, marinaded for one hour only, browned the chicken in a skillet with a small amount of sesame oil and roasted for 30-35 minutes at 375 degrees, basting with leftover marinade (which i boiled before reusing) every 10 minutes, and turning the chicken in teh roasting pan halfway through cooking. It was great!

Good basic chicken recipe.  Definitely needs to marinade MORE than 3 hours.  I punched holes in boneless skinless chicken breasts to help the meat inside soak up the marinade.  Next time I'll try thickening the marinade after cooking to use as a sauce.

Amazing flavor, I took advice of other reviewer and rubbed chicken with a mix of olive oil and minced garlic. I also used brown sugar instead of white, and I marinated all day. So easy and delicious. Great meal to prepare in advance!

I made this recipe with 2 changes. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a tablespoon of sherry to help tenderize the meat.
It was extremely sweet and tasty. I used an electric grill to cook up the breasts. I plan on making this again for tomorrow and we'll be using a charcoal grill. I'm sure it's going to be even better :D

This had nice flavor but mostly in the skin. The recipe is nice and easy and we enjoyed it. I might try removing the skin next time to see how it turns out.

I made it with chicken breasts (skinless) and ground ginger as I didn't have fresh and it was great. Will definitely make again and the sauce can be thickened and put on other things too - rice, veggies, etc.

This recipe is fabulous! Like many others we substitued brown sugar in lieu of white sugar and our family loved it. We baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes, instead of 1 hour the recipe suggests. (We used 7 chicken thighs). We will definitely make this one again - it's a Keeper!

I had to think of a quick dish to make that would be ready for us when we returned home. I did a quick search for teriyaki chicken and found this. It turned out wonderful. I put the chicken ontop of broccoli and rice and it made the perfect meal.

I used boneless chicken halves instead of whole chicken, used white sugar instead of granulated and didn't use fresh grated ginger but instead the powder kind you find in small bottles. I also marinated it overnight instead of for 3 hours. The result was very "tasteful" and delicious, much like teriyaki chicken although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. You can do it either way, the outcome is very good. I would make again.

Well, I was really hoping that my family would like this. Two out of four liked it. I thought it was good, not great. It seems to be missing something, just not sure what it is. My family has asked ne not to make this again. Sorry I couldn't give this recipe a better review. :(

This was quick,easy and it taste GREAT!!!  I used Brown sugar instead of the granulated, I also added a table spoon of rice wine vinegar and also 1/4 tsp of crushed red peppers.... I did add all the ingredients to a sauce pan brought it to a slight boil once it cooled I added it to the bag of cut up chicken to marinate.  As a finishing touch I added some fresh broccoli to the mix and topped over rice!!! It was great!!!

Excellent marinade! Used brown instead of white sugar and used "light" soya sauce. Also used it for boneless pork chops, which were absolutely mouth-watering! Will use it on a regular basis! Thank you!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out delicious.  The marinade was excellent.  I even used low-sodium soy sauce.  I also love that this is so easy to make. I did have to bake it for almost 1 1/2 hrs and turn it up to 400 degrees, but my husband said it was the best whole chicken I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent!  I liked that I could prepare and marinate the night before then just pop it in the oven to have ready for dinner.  Will be adding this to my normal rotation.

We made this with boneless chicken breast. It had a great flavor. We served it with brown rice. This one is a keeper!

This was good, though a bit sweet. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used brown sugar instead of white. I also used boneless breast havles. I loved the flavor; will definitely make this again, but will cut back on the sugar.

I made a few changes.  Instead of sugar, I used a little less than a teaspoon of stevia, added a small amount of worchestire sauce, a little raw apple cider vinegar, lots of garlic, and only about 1/2C of low sodium soy sauce.  With all the changes, it's not quite the same, but turned out amazing!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent! I used low-sodium soy sauce and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. It turned out very juicy and flavorful. This is a great easy, inexpensive weeknight meal that I will definately make again. Might turn it into sandwiches next time.

This has worked its way into my meal rotation. I can't believe how easy it was to prepare. These are ingredients I always have on hand, I used brown sugar instead of white and even more of the fresh ginger and some lemon juice. I cut up chicken breast into chunks before I cooked it and served on jasmine rice.

This recipe is great. My husband doesn't care that much for chicken and liked it so well he wanted to take it to work for his lunch the next day.  I did have  some trouble  baking it.  After about 45 minutes my glaze started to burn around the chicken in the pan.  I am thinking maybe I should have used a smaller one.  Then I cooked it the full hour and cut into it and it was RAW!!!  I ended up having to take it out of the pan I was cooking it in because the glaze was so burned and putting it in another with a little water in the bottom.  I also covered it so the glaze on the chicken wouldn't burn.  We ended up having to eat it the  next night because my kids were starving, but man it was good.

This was so easy to make!  My husband totally loved it as did I.  I marinated overnight, which made making dinner tonight very easy; just stick the chicken in the oven!  I used low sodium soy sauce, threw in a load of garlic, and some chopped up basil, which added a nice flavor.  I baked at 500F for 25 minutes, which made the skin nice and crispy, and then for 35 minutes at 375.  This chicken is SO good.  Thanks!

Very moist chicken with great flavor.  Don't be limited by only pairing with asian sides.  Compliments well in the fall with brown sugared & baked acorn squash!

I made this for my husband and parents for a family dinner.  It was a hit!  I made the recipe as written but I left out the ginger because I didn't have any.  I marinated the chicken for 10 hours.  I found that it took longer than an hour for the chicken to cook in my oven.  I ended up cooking it for 90 minutes with the last 15 minutes on 400, which made it browned it nicely on top.  Great and easy recipe.  I will be making this again soon.

Absolutely FABULOUS! My 2 and 3 yr old children loved it as did the rest of the family!!!! The only thing I did different was add the juice of 1/2 a lime to the recipe and let the chicken marinate in all of it a little longer...Loved it!

Easy and good tasting! I too, subsituted the white sugar for brown, and I'm not a big teriyaki fan, but I think this was a good change from our normal chicken dishes. Thanks!

I too used brown sugar instead of white in this recipe.  The taste of the sauce was delicious.  Unfortunately, I over-cooked my chicken since I was guessing on the amount of time for chicken breast strips.  However I will make this again and will adjust the timing.

I made this recipe with chicken breast and accidentally baked it too long.  My fiance said it tasted more like jerk chicken.  I cooked veggies in the same sauce on the stove and they were spectacular!  I loved it so much, I am going to try the marinade on some salmon next.  I used ginger from the jar I picked up at an asian grocery store in Chinatown.

It was good. I gave it a 4 only because the granulated sugar wasn't as good as when I tried it again with brown sugar. Second time was delicious!!

This was exceptional and easy! The only things I changed were using low sodium soy sauce and dry ginger for the fresh (didn't have the real stuff) my family of 7 ate a doubled recipe and wanted more. Definitely will be making again! Thank you for sharing :)

I use this as a marinade/baste for chicken wings cooked on the grill.  I do not add the ginger though.  Very good to be so simple.

This is a great marinade recipe. I love the fact that there is no MSG in this recipe. Make it even better by using low-sodium Soy sauce! John 3:16

I used this recipe with a few minor changes and saved my family from a boring meal. Great recipe for a busy family that loves chicken.

so good. I used it over salmon, used fresh ginger and a tiny bit of honey to balance the saltyness and it was delicious. I took other's suggestions about making extra so there would be sauce to pour over the rice and veggies. Yum!

Not too bad. My family ate it and didn't complain. I used breasts instead of thighs and topped each breast with a pineapple ring and a cherry. I will probably make it again.

Wow that was good. I used brown sugar and thickened the pan drippings with corn starch. I love teriyaki sauce and this was spot on. No more bottled junk for me.

I followed the ingredient list exactly, but used boneless, skinless breasts.  I marinated all day.  This was really tasty.  I served with broccoli and white rice and used the leftover marinade as a sauce on the rice.  The leftovers were even better!  Thanks!

Served to 9 guests at birthday dinner - just what the guest of honor ordered!  Got rave reviews.  Menu included steamed broccoli and white rice (and birthday cake with nine candles).  Sauce was great over rice.

This is excellent!  My 12 year old loves teriyaki chicken at Chinese restaurants so I had to try this.  I'm glad I did!  The changes I made:  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them into strips.  and decreased the baking time.  Next time I will decrease the soy sauce to 2/3 cup because using just the chicken breast strips made it be too much sauce and it was a little overly salty.

Nice flavor. Next time I will use boneless chicken breasts as I think the flavor will draw through more. The only thing I did different was to use Splenda instead of sugar. Will make again!

Easy and very tasty.  I used bonless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.
Use sauce for a quick and easy stir fry sauce, just add some cornstarch to thicken it up.

Excellent!  I used brown sugar and light/low sodium soy sauce and added half a Tbsp of red garlic chile paste.  Used three boneless chicken breasts cut-up, marinated for 3-hours and then put in a large skillet on high.  Served with steamed white rice and fresh steamed broccoli.  It was VERY good!

My husband said this was the best teriyaki chicken I've ever made. A few notes: (1) I used about 9 frozen chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken. (2) I didn't marinate; rather, I just covered the tenders with the sauce stirring over and over for about 5 minutes. I cooked for about a half hour. I will definately make this recipe again!

Easy peasy... and tasty too. I used boneless chicken thighs and added a little fresh lemon juice and substituted white sugar for sucanut (you can use brown sugar). After marinating I cut them into smaller pieces and put them onto wooden skewers (long strips can be folded), reduced cooking time by half, turned them once mid-way through cooking and they turned out great!

Use low sodium soy sauce and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Wound up marinating for 3 days and then stir frying. Man, was it good. Not salty at all.

I made this the other night for supper and it was really good!  I did not have time to marinate the chicken so I poked holes in the chicken with a fork and put the sauce over it and it was still really good.  Thank you for your recipe.

Very easy to make and very yummy. This dish had a lot of flavor and the chicken stayed moist.
