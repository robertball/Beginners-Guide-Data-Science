Easy and good...doesn't get any better then that.  I did use salsa instead of ketchup, and half sour cream and salad dressing.  To lower the fat and calorie content I used fat free salad dressing, sour cream and tortilla chips. My family could not tell the difference and the salad still rocked!!  Thank you, Joy.

I used a red french dressing for this...have no idea why, just thought it might be good...and it was.  I really liked this.  Although I do agree with another reviewer that it doesn't have great stage presence, of course that could be from my red dressing.  It was very good and everyone who tried it wanted the recipe.  Thanks for the post.

Joy has reinvented the taco salad with this yummy dressing!  This easy dinner becomes a next day follow up too!  I chop it fine for a salad the first night...then the next day after everything has melded overnight it becomes a tasty lunch with Fritos to scoop it up with (dip like!)  Thanks Joy!  Always nice to have something new to rotate into my menu for dinner!!!  A+ and then some!

The recipie was good, but I would make less next time, alot went to waste because iceberg lettuce does not last that long...we also put the sauce on as needed on the individual plates as not to make the salad soggy!

I would use more meat next time I made this recipe. I would also use taco sauce in place of the ketchup. Otherwise very yummy.

This is a wonderful salad.  I made it for an office party, and it yields a lot more than Joy would make you think.  Ironically, it is so large that I was not able to toss the salad in the largest bowl I own.  I didn't read Joy's comment until just now, but what I did was toss the salad in a garbage bag.  It worked like a charm.  The reviews I got on the salad were wonderful, and I told everyone at work where to find it.

This made for a tasty and filling lunch. I used half sour cream half mayo, and like others sub'd salsa for the ketchup in the dressing. One bag of chips was sufficient. We don't care for chickpeas so I used frozen whole kernel corn instead. Beautiful presentation, too. Thanks Joy.

I loved this recipe.  I served it for a family get-together and everyone loved it, too.  A suggestion that I have is to half the salad dressing, ketchup, taco seasoning mixture.  It would have been far too much if I had used all the dressing.  I highly recommend making this salad -- you won't go wrong.

The first taco salad I've ever made.  Loved it!  Left out squash cause it's not a favorite at our house.  But I think it still would have been good with the squash.

This taco salad was excellent. My family really enjoyed it. Next time I will remember to scale it down to a smaller amount of servings. It was waayyy to much for us to eat.

Left out garbanzo beans but otherwise made it exactly.  It was good but I just did not care for the mix of ketchup and mayo.

It was a hit! I made it to for a potluck using the salad dressing/sour cream/taco sauce idea for the dressing. I also had cans of black beans and corn in my pantry, so substituted those for the kidneys and garbanzos. It made a huge batch and we didn't have to bring much home, and several people asked me for the recipe. This is a keeper! Thanks!

I'd recommend using Fritos instead of tortilla chips, they're SO good in this! We didn't care for how the dressing tasted (too sour from the Miracle Whip) so we did another batch with only 2 tbsp of Miracle Whip, not as much ketchup, 1 1/2 cups of light sour cream, and a little bit of regular mayo (1-2 tbsp) and then the taco seasoning, and mmmmmmmm was that good!!! I don't remember if the recipe calls for them, but I added black olives on top, which were fantastic in this! Definitely a great family dinner.

This salad is great, very tasty! However, I'm not very fond of day-old-lettuce. Just be sure to eat it all the same day (no problem with that here!). ;)

I deleted the chiles because it was for a family potluck and not everyone likes hot. I put frozen sweet corn in instead. Excellent recipe!

My friend Cathie makes this often during our Summer get-togethers and we all love it! She makes it with ground turkey instead of the beef and uses a large bottled Thousand Island dressing in place of the Miracle Whip/ketchup mixture. Simply yummy!

I don't know what I was expecting, but we thought this was just ok. The dressing was a little bit peculiar, and the meat was pretty boring. Some cumin and lime juice would probably have helped. Oh well, thanks anyway!

This is good. Made it exactly like the recipe said. I really liked the dressing. It was nice to use items that I always have at home to make it. For me that is what pushed this recipe to a five. Next time I will add a few more spices to the dressing to give it an extra zing. This is a great recipe for a crowd it makes tons!

I can't give this recipe 5 stars b/c it does not look very appetizing when it's all done and in the bowl, But for those who did try it they all loved it and went back for seconds and even thirds but alot of poeple didn't even try it so I did have alot left over... Maybe for a simple BBQ or party I would make this again but for a larger, nicer party it wasn't very appealing to the eye.

Awesome!  I read some of the other reviews, so I used 1 cup salad dressing, 1 cup sour cream, and instead of ketchup, I used taco sauce.  This dish was a great addition to our barbeque.

Made this for an office lunch today - RAVE REVIEWS - I took someone elses suggestion and used salsa instead of the ketchup.  I also only used one bag of chips - but that's the great thing about the recipe you can change to your personal taste - it's all good!

Wonderful!  I sauteeed the peppers, and changed the dressing as one reveiwer suggested.  1.5 cups light sour cream, about 1/3 cup ketchup, and a taco seasoning mix from this site.  I loved this, and so did my family.

This is the first taco salad I have made and it was delicious.  I added the green chillis in with the ketchup/salad dressing and let the whole lot sit for a while and then added it to the meat to blend the tastes.  I will definitely make it again.

A friend brought this to work recently for a potluck and it was gone faster than anything else on the table.  When I asked for the recipe I was surprised at the ingredients as I would never have thought of salad dressing and ketchup in taco salad.  Don't be put off by that though. This dish is incredibly good.

This was a delicious recipe!!! The only thing we changed was to add a little bit of skim milk to the dressing and a little bit more taco seasoning to the dressing. Great veggies though!!!

Excellent recipe! I added about 50% more ground beef than what the original recipe called for. It was great!

I really like the combination of the flavors when I bit into each piece.  My boyfriend and I love anything to do with taco meat so we were both pleased with this...I guess next time I should make it for a party even though I can eat the whole thing on my own.

I am in the middle of making it right now, it is looking so so good.  Am I reading this right that it is to be served cold?  Not sure how my kids will feel about cold ground beef and unmelted cheese. But then again can't see heating up sour cream and mayo either. If anyone can respond, I'd appreciate it

I accidentally used Best Foods mayo and it seemed heavy to me.  Family liked it though.  I suspect it might taste even better after it is in the fridge for awhile.

Super Easy and Yummy as Well!

 Keeping with the Mexican Salad theme, here are a couple of substitutes that my family really loves:

1.) in lieu of kidney beans…use black beans (drained); 2.) in lieu of garbanzo beans…use whole kernel corn (drained); 3.) in lieu of ketchup…use salsa or better still, Pico de Gallo; 4.) in lieu of cheddar cheese…use a Mexican blended mix; 5.) for added taste and color...toss in red bell pepper, along with the green and yellow; 6.) for salad dressing…use either jalapeño ranch or guacamole ranch; 7.) for the ultimate taste sensation…use cilantro, cilantro and more cilantro (fresh).

Enjoy!
