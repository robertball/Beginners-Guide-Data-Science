I made this and it came out delicious!  I wanted a recipe with herbes de provence but didn't realize until i was about to make it that it called for a proprietary spice packet.  I used the herb mix that I already had, but I added more salt and pepper to it, since the McCormick version has salt in it.  Also, I think the lavender scent and flavor can be way too overpowering, depending on the spice mix.  I did 50% herbes de provence, and 50% italian seasoning (upon my research, they had very similar herbs minus the lavender).  During the last few minutes of cooking, i broiled it to brown the top of the chicken.  This came out perfectly!!  Everyone loved it. Super easy and flavorful.

This was awesome! I did make a few quick changes. I didn't have the herbes-de-provence spice packet so I just used what I had on hand. Also used the crockpot instead of oven.

Yummmm!  This smells incredible while cooking, and the outcome is foolproof.  I did broil it for a minute or two at the end to get a nice brown color on the chicken.  A perfect meal to serve to family or friends, and the seasoning packet makes it easy on you--PLUS since you cook it on a foil lined pan, clean up is easy.  5 stars all the way!

I've made this twice now and I realized why it's so appealing to me. It reminds me of something my Mom would have made for our family when I was younger. It's a rustic, old school, comforting meal. A wholesome, wonderful family dinner!

Tried this tonight on a whim because it is the featured recipe.  Wow it is good!!!  I added minced garlic, diced sweet onions and celery along with the other veggies, followed all the other directions exactly.  It turned out incredible.  I definitely recommend this recipe!  I had to go to two different stores to find the seasoning mix though.  So don't give up trying to find it, it's worth it!

This was quite good! I liked the white wine with the herbs but I didn't use the McCormick pack, I just used my Herbs de Provence spice. Also did just chicken breasts, not with bone in.

I couldn't find the actual Herbes de provence package in the store so I ended up buying a bottle instead.  I ended up modifying the recipe a bit: I diced half a red onion and pressed 4 garlic cloves and mixed it in with the potatoes, carrots and chicken along with some sea salt and black pepper.  The dish turned out great!

Delicious!  I made this as a whole chicken roast versus chicken pieces.  I did not have the seasoning packet so I used the following spices:
4 teaspoons Herbes de Provence,
1 teaspoon roasted garlic,
1 teaspoon salt,
1/2 teaspoon celery seed, and 
1/4 teaspoon pepper.

I rubbed 1/2 the  spice mixture on the chicken and put the other half in a large zip lock bag.  I cut the vegies and tossed them in the bag to coat them with the seasoning.  Then, I added the olive oil and wine into the bag.   

I cooked the roast in a large pottery baker (the type where you soak the top in water for 45 minutes before baking-  I believe Pampered Chef may offer something similar; mine is called a Schlemmer Topf).  I put half the vegies under the chicken, then crowded the rest of them around it.  Covered and baked at 400 degrees for 1.5 hours.  

Delicious!  Highly recommend.

I made this recipe this past Thursday. My personal tweak was to replace wine w/chicken broth, add 1 tbsp minced garlic, and a large sweet onion. My husband loved it so much he wants it put in the rotation! I brought leftovers to work for lunch the next day. My co-workers went wild for the smell, and all wanted the recipe! SOOO good!! :)

this was delicious. The only thing I would add next time is salt and pepper!  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars!  Yummy. The family loved it.

This was excellent. I did substitute chicken broth for the wine and added onions and chopped spinach. I also used mcCormicks grill mates roasted garlic and herb seasoning as I did not have the provence. I also used fresh chicken tenders instead of the other.  Delish in a dish!! I guess I changed alot. But it was a great inspiration!

I didn't realize it called for a seasoning packet but luckily I had the Herb de Provence spice on hand. I added some Grill Mates Garlic Herb seasoning to the wine, olive oil mix and only put that on the chicken.  I didn't want everything to have the same seasoning flavor. The potatoes I did an olive oil and Italian seasoning glaze. Put it all on the pan and cooked it as directed. The chicken came out so moist and flavorful. The potatoes were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and the carrots were soft but flavorful since they soaked up all the juices. I know I changed the recipe but I know that if I used the seasoning packet it would of been just as delicious.

This was absolutely delicious! Definitely putting it into the rotation! I used Herbs de Provence and a little sprinkle of salt since I didn't have the packet and Marsala wine instead of white wine. My chicken browned up beautifully and the potatoes were perfect. The carrots were a little less cooked than I would've liked, but I'd suggest getting petite baby carrots for next time.

I usually don't take the time to rate recipes )o: but had to on this one. We loved it! So quick and easy to put together and so tasty. Husband raved about it. Local store didn't have the seasoning packet so followed other reviewer's suggestion and used 50% Herbs de Provence and 50% Italian seasoning. Worked great! Thanks for posting!

The vegys were wonderful, but the meat was a little bland.  Moist, but bland.  We prefer to make meat without the skin to increase the flavor.

Great weeknight meal!  I used chicken thighs which I skinned to remove most of the extra fat/calories.  I also added 1/2 large sliced onion for extra flavor, and doubled up on the potatoes.  I also added some extra olive oil and some Montreal steak seasoning to compensate for the extra vegs.  The chicken came out crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside.  The vegs were slightly crispy on the outside, and perfectly seasoned.  Easy and Delicious!  Next time I won't bother lining the pan with foil because for me, the foil stuck to the pan anyway.  I will be adding this recipe to our rotation.

I love this dish! It turned out so good. I just didn't use the Mccormick packet of spices dur to the high sodium content. Instead I used Mccormck's perfect pinch garlic and Herb salt free seasoning and added salt to my taste preference.... Overall, family loved it.

This recipe is my all time favorite.  Sometimes I follow it almost exactly and sometimes it inspires me. The chicken is so moist and juicy.  One time I substituted Guniess (sp?) beer for the white wine, so yummy.  I will continue to make this recipe as it is the best chicken ever.
