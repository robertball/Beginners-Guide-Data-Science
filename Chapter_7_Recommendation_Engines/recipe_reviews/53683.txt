I read a lot of reviews with concerns about 'scrambled eggs' which is common when eggs are cooked too quickly.  As a pastry chef I always temper the eggs.  Here's how to do it:  Combine the juice and zest in a double boiler and heat until hot, not boiling.  If you don't have a double boiler, a metal bowl atop a saucepan filled with water works just fine, just make sure it's stable.  Have the eggs in a separate bowl, and mix in the sugar just before adding the juice.  When the juice is hot, SLOWLY pour some over the eggs and sugar while whisking.  This may take two people, but a towel under the egg bowl will help it from moving around.  You don't have to pour all the juice, just enough to make the egg mixture the same temperature as the juice. Pour the egg mixture back into the juice over a strainer.  This will get rid of any eggs that may have curdled.  Then cook over medium-low heat until thick enough to hold the marks from the whisk.   Finally remove the curd from the heat and add the butter a little at a time, stirring to help it melt.  I hope this helps anyone concerned about curdling eggs!

I have made this several times now. I omit the zest and use 1/2 stick butter=1/4 cup. To avoid any cooked egg bits I cream the butter and sugar then add eggs one at a time mixing well after each.  Then add lemon juice then heat.  Takes about 15-20 minutes to thicken, stir constantly.

I haven't made Lemon Curd yet, but I'm puzzled by comments about the cooked eggs. To keep the eggs from cooking, just mix the butter and sugar together, creaming them just as you would when making a cake. Then add the eggs, one at a time, and mix each one in real well. Then add the lemon juice and zest. Then heat in pan. The eggs will not cook!

Word to the wise, this recipe is great, and easy to make.. but don't make the mistake of making it in a reactive pot or double boiler (i.e. made of metal) unless you're a big fan of the flavor of metal...

This is a pretty classic lemon curd, although some recipes would add more butter and use only egg yolks (no whites).  The operative word in the directions is SLOWLY.  It should take your curd about 15-20 minutes to SLOWLY heat and thicken.  This needs to be sitrred very frequently for the first 10-15 minutes and then almost constantly as it begins to thicken to prevent burning.  Cooking it this way, you'll have no problems.  Cooked egg is a sign that your heat was too high and you weren't stirring enough.  If you're nervous about it, I suggest cooking over a double boiler on medium (not high!) heat.  This is not a recipe you want to walk away from as it's cooking.  Good, clean, classic flavor, though.

I picked a huge load of lemons over Thanksgiving with plans to make lemon curd.  I set about looking for a recipe that didn't look too eggy and seemed to have a good tart/sweet balance.  I settled on this one after looking around online and through several cookbooks.  This was delicious and so easy!  

I cooked it on low heat because my range is gas, and I often find recipes calling for medium low need low on mine.  However, it was taking quite a lot longer than the 6 minutes in the recipe.  I finally turned it up to medium low, and I stirred CONSTANTLY (even when it was on low heat).  Honestly, this was spectacular!  I can't wait to make more (I only made one batch.)  I'm also going to make some scones to put it on (the other day, I ate it just on plain toast -- oh, my gosh, I had to make myself stop at 2 pieces!)

Thanks for a great recipe, Tawnie!

I love lemon curd and have never made it at home because I thought it would be too much trouble. Totally easy and came out perfectly (hence the name, I guess). Thanks!

One word...YUMMY! It is important to cook on low heat stirring constantly until thick. If a moderate to high heat is used it will become lemon scrambled eggs.  
I served this at a dinner party by spooning it over slices of pound cake and then topping it off with sliced strawberries.  Everyone asked for seconds!  Do try this recipe and enjoy!

Outstanding!!  I'm not sure what the problem was for the other reviewers--I had success with this recipe and it tastes wonderful. Perhaps the key is to make sure to whisk the mixture on *very low* heat continuously until done. You definitely don't want to overcook it or heat it to high (or yes, it will cook the egg). Like custards, this can be fussy, but if you follow the recipe you should have success as I did. Good luck! It's soooo tasty! Mmmm!

I made my curd using the exact ingredients of this recipe, but I changed the way I put them together based on recommendations I received from someone on the Buzz.  And it worked PERFECTLY!  I creamed the butter and sugar just like I was going to make cookies or cake.  Then I added the eggs one at a time, beating until very fluffy each time.  Then I added the lemon juice and zest.  When it was fully mixed, I poured it into a pan and heated it on stovetop, stirring constantly.  It gave me perfect curd with no egg curdles!  Like magic!  Oh, yum!  Now it's used as a filling in a birthday cake with some leftovers for my toast!  Yummy!  Yummy!

A little on the "too buttery" side for me.  The bigger issue, however, is just as others have noted, the instructions do not reflect standard and classic technique - the inexperienced cook may not recognize this and might risk cooking the eggs rather than the custard if not careful.

I wanted Orange curd but I can't buy any decent lemon curd in South Africa and nobody has heard of orange curd but I wanted this for a fantastic chocolate orange tart.  I just changed the lemons for oranges; absolutely fantastic.    I didn't bother to try the other recipes I found on the net.  About eggs curdling, I use a stoneware pot that I cook everything with eggs in, sauces, etc which I put in the pan with boiling water.  The water boils but the eggs don't curdle.  It's a slow method but worth every minute as there's no fear of any burning either.

This is a good base recipe.  In the end, I added the juice of an extra lemon since the curd had more of a butter taste than lemon.  It was still good, but not as lemony as one would expect and hope.  A couple of changes I will make next time: 1- use egg yolks (no whites).  Although I combined all ingredients before even turning on the heat, I still had bits of cooked egg whites that I had to strain; 2 - use 5 or 6 tablespoons of butter instead of an entire stick.  Also, it took my mixture nearly 15 minutes to begin bubbling.  Still, this recipe is a great jumping off point for those of us who had never attempted to make lemon curd before.  Thank you for sharing.

It took all that was in me to stop myself from taking a spoon to this and going to town.  It's that good.  I thought it had the perfect amount of lemon flavor and a great consistancy.  I creamed the butter and sugar together before adding the eggs and lemon, stirred and then added to the saucepan and had no issues whatsoever with my eggs cooking or it taking a year and a half to thicken.  If I was standing at the stove for more than 10 minutes with this one, I'd be shocked.  You can bet on the fact that this will be used again.  Thanks!

This was a very good recipe.  I tripled the recipe and froze what I didn't use.  It is freezer friendly and I used as a filling for a wedding cake I made for friends.  I did add a 1/2 more sugar and 1/4 more lemon juice to the recipe.  This was very easy to make too.

This was my first time making curd.  WOW!  I love this stuff!  I had no issues with the eggs as some other reviewers did.  Once I squeezed the lemons I strained the juices through some cheesecloth.  I skipped the zest completely because I don't care for the bitterness it can add. I did not miss it and felt the recipe was perfect without it.   I melted the butter in my pan first, then added the sugar and cooked until absorbed and no longer grainy. Then I added the lemon juice and let cool down.  Once cooled I added my eggs that I had beaten first and returned to the stove to finish cooking.  I wanted something a little sturdier so I used 1/2 a Knox gelatin packet and it worked perfectly.  I used the filling to make my Fruity Cream Cheese Danish in my recipe box.  I really enjoyed this curd and look forward to making again!

This lemon curd recipe is excellent.  I dumped everything in a pan and commenced to stir... no problems!  It thickened to the perfect, dollop-able texture; it was bright colored, bright flavored, light and fluffy.  I only used 1 Tbl. of butter, and found that very adequate.  I've had problems with lemon curds tasting eggy, and that wasn't a problem this time.  Delicious, delicious!!  I can't wait to try it with grapefruit or limes next time.

I have dreamed of making lemon curd since I heard of it in a tea-time recipe book when I was seven. However, the recipe was so complicated, and my greatest fear when baking is that I'll make a flop! When I found this recipe, it looked so simple and really was! As other cooks suggested, I heated up the lemon juice, add the sugar and eggs (I used 6 yolks instead), all beaten up, and whisked constantly on med-low until thick- ten minutes. Then I added 1/4 c butter. The next time I want to make lemon curd, I'll know exactly where to go!!! YUM!!! =)

Turned out perfectly! I like that this recipe uses whole eggs instead of yolk so it is less messy to make. I use liquid eggs, so it makes it even easier.

Absolutely wonderful lemon curd. Nice texture and delightfully tart. It's such a simple recipe, too. I just used a normal saucepan, like the directions said to, and it worked beautifully. You don't need a double boiler to make this recipe, just a pan and a wire whisk, and the attention span necessary to stand there and stir it until it thickens.
The only thing I did differently is that I completely forgot to add the butter, and I think I prefer it this way! I will definitely make it again, and maybe next time I'll try it with the butter, just for the sake of the recipe.

Other reviews made me nervous, so I used a very low heat and didn't stop stirring.  It took about 25 minutes, but the result was perfect.  Next time I'll brave a little higher temperature.
Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll never buy it in a jar again.

ive made lemon curd every spring for the last 3 years for a sugar cookie filling my family looks forward to it every year, and this recipe has helped me make a perfect curd every time

one tip I can give people is keep the temp on the stove LOW ! and slowly work it up very slow otherwise this can curdle the milk very very quickly but this recipe works amazing !

Wonderful recipe for lemon curd.   This is not all that well known here but so great on scones and as a filling for cakes.   Also makes lovely tarts with a dollop of whipping cream on top.  The possibilities are endless.

easy to make and delicious. I used the reviews that suggested mixing it first prior to heating.

WOW! Everyone loved this. Good idea to temper the eggs first to avoid scrambled eggs.

This is on the sweet side, but I used it in another recipe so it worked fine. There is another recipe on AR that is more tart that if you want a more tart curd, other than that it's delicious!

Very yummy and easy - I used the microwave.  I also cut the butter to 1/8 cup from 1/2 cup - to make it healthier.

Excellent Lemon curd! I did end up with a couple little pieces of egg, but no one else would have ever noticed. My advice is to keep the heat as low as you can and never stop mixing.

Delicous! I doubled the lemon zest. Also melted the butter and sugar on low heat until the sugar was dissolved then added the lemon juice which cooled down the mixture a bit before i added the eggs last so they didnt cook. I then turned up the heat a bit and stirred until thick. A great way to use up lemons.

This is a great recipe, so fast and easy.  I lost my grandmothers recipe and this taste just like her lemon curd.  The only thing I did different was using 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cups.  I read some of the other reviews and they commented on the lemon curd being a little too tart so I added a little more sugar.

Terrific!  Sweet and Tart just to our liking.  I've made this several times already and am going to make it now for Easter layered between a white cake next to a thin layer of butter cream. Whipped cream frosting on top and strawberries.  Delightful.  As for not setting up, the last time I made it, I rushed it and thought it would thicken more as it cooled.  I had to pull it from the refrigerator and continue cooking it until I had the consistency that I wanted.  Don't rush it, you won't be happy with your results, but fortunately, it was very forgiving in that I was able to continue the cooking process.

Thank you, Tawnie for a wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Add a little corn starch with the sugar if you need it to set up more firm.

Update: Double the recipe, 1 1/4  cup sugar,1 stick of butter, 1TB cornstarch in with the sugar and only 5 eggs (7 med. lemons).

This is an excellent recipe.  I did find however I needed to wisk it in a double boiler, I simply place a bowl over simmering water.  This removes the danger of scrambled eggs.

Too much butter and it takes much longer than it says.  I added a teaspoon of lemon extract too for some extra flavor.

I decided to try this recipe since my other one takes a little longer to make. I just finnished making this and it did not thicken up as much as I had originally thought. I did temper my eggs but after returning the mixture to the heat it was taking a long time to thicken. So in fear of curdling my eggs I took it off the stove. Even though it was still a little runny I whisked in some gelatin while it was still hot to try and thicken it and it did help some. Then I added my butter after it cooled some and it did set up a little nicer.

Followed the recipe exactly...I used a mixer and blended the sugar and butter, then added the eggs, then added the juice and zest.  Then transferred to stove.  Had no problems with mini pieces of scrambled eggs...however, I did pass it through a sieve to get rid of the zest once finished cooking.  Make sure you keep on stiring this the whole time!  Took mine at least ten minutes.  After it had cooled a little, I tasted it and it was very tart so I added more sugar until it fit my personal preference.  I made this recipe for a filling for a cake--mine definitely thickened up but I think it was too thin for cake filling (cake may just absorb it all).  Next time I make this, I will DEFINITELY add cornstarch to make it really really thick and add more sugar...overall, a great base recipe to try :)

I was trying to come up with something to give my friend (one of those people who shops constantly and has EVERYTHING!!) for her birthday.    She absolutely loves lemon curd so....   Turns out this was the all time favorite gift for her.   I kept a little bit back for myself for tasting and found it quite tart but excellent.  The consistency and flavor is perfect.   I didn't have any lemon rind on hand so made it without.   Next time I'll be certain to put it in for an added zing.  This recipe is a must for all who enjoy a nice lemon flavor with plenty of tartness but enough sweetness for a godd balance.

This recipe is great. The curd is just the right balance of lemony and sweet. Once it bubbled, I added about 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to help it solidify a bit more. My friend and I made this and gave it with gingerbread cakes for Christmas gifts. It was a hit.

This is a great tasting, very easy recipe.  Make it just as directed -- throw everything in together and cook it.  Don't worry about "scrambled eggs" -- just whisk it as it cooks.  I made this for some British friends and they raved.

I just threw all the ingredients together, then stirred over a medium double boiler.  I never stopped stirring and it came out perfect.  The flavor was full of lemon-y goodness, and I served it with scones and clotted cream. Everyone loved it.

I used the double boiler method over medium heat, as one reviewer suggested, and still got a few egg whites, so I cheated and spun it in the blender for about 20 sec, then returned to the double boiler over low heat.  The flavor is awesome, next time I'll again use the double boiler, but over low heat not medium.  Thanks!

Never having searched for a recipe for it, making lemon curd seemed intimidating.  I located this recipe and made it for a bridal shower.  It was simple enough to make, and it was a hit!  I'll never buy it again.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

I had heard a lot about lemon curd but never tried it. I decided to give it a go as an accent for some gingerbread biscotti I made. Oh man .. it was great. I dumped all the ingredients into the same pot and whisked it as it warmed. Then I kept whisking it until it got thick - took a while and I increased my temp part way through but worth it! I was going to take this to the family celebration but I'm not sure it's going to last that long. YUM!

This was my first time making lemon curd. I followed the recipe as written. I had no problems with the eggs as I took the advice of low heat and stir, stir, stir. It is delicious!

Did not use lemon zest, just the juice.  Turned out sweeter/more buttery than I had imagined. Next time I will add zest and cut down on the butter to get more of a gel than a cream.  Husband loved it, we served it on scones and bread.

Absolutely delicious enough to eat alone. I would add additional thickening if I wanted to use as a pie filling, though. I strained the end product to remove the rind any egg that might have curdled, and because I didn't want to watch for seeds when juicing lemons :).

It took me about thirty minutes over low heat to get this to thicken, and even tempering the eggs I ended up having to strain it.  I've since learned that there is a microwave lemon curd recipe on this site- I think I would try that one if I make it again.

I LOVED this recipe.  The perfect amount of tartness.  I used it for jelly filled doughnuts and it worked perfectly!  My husband said that it was too strong, but I really didn't think so.  It is a little runny though and doesn't quite set to a custard texture, so be warned.

Very yummy and lemony! Perfect consistancy. However, it took me a lot longer using a double broiler at medium low heat (about 50 mins cook time). But I am super pleased with it anyway since I was afraid to get the scrambled eggs that others had mentioned. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent curd recipe.  only change was the order in which i added everything. and had the eggs at room temp. since i do not have a double boiler, i used a saucepan and a metal bowl.  brought about an inch of water to a simmer in the saucepan and then placed my metal bowl on top. from there i added my fresh lemon juice and zest.  zest tip - zest your lemons with a microplane zester (you can use the microplane for anything you need finely grated..parm cheese, citrus zesting you name it!) before juicing.  makes it easier on yourself.  i warmed the juice and zest up and then whisked in my sugar. in a separate bowl, have your room temp eggs whipped up and ready to go. now... while whisking your double boiler, SLOWLY..(and i mean drizzle in) add your eggs keep whisking while your adding your eggs. i cant emphasize that enough. keep it moving. you may get some froth from all the agitation, but dont worry. keep whisking for another minute or two after you've finished adding your eggs. you'll notice it starting to thicken already. now, add your diced up butter and keep whisking until the curd thickens.  did i mention to keep whisking?  Once it is at decent consistency, you can jar or can as you see fit. It makes about 2 half pint jars.  Though my technique is not as easy as dumping everything into  bowl and busting out the hand mixer, the attention you've paid to the curd will pay off with no scrambled eggs and lovely little tart curd that will make you say NO to store bought curd!

I used a double boiler over medium-low heat and first creamed the butter and sugar, then slowly added each egg one at a time, stirring constantly. Then I combined the lemon juice and zest.

I made this as part of  my Christmas Treat Bags this year , as well as the filling for mini tarts at my Christmas Party Dessert Buffet.  I 5x'ed the recipe and it was as easy as could be.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions of creaming the butter and sugar together, then adding the eggs one at a time (15 eggs took a bit of time) but oh, was it worth it.    Smooth and silky without any bits of cooked eggs.    I got 15( 8 oz) mason jars and filled 30 mini tarts.  I received so many complements on the flavor of the tart fillings, and when  I told my guests that they were each getting a jar to take home they were thrilled.  Super easy and great tasting!

This is a beautifully proportioned tart to sweet curd. So keeping that in mind, make these few simple procedural changes and enjoy this lovely recipe. Use a double boiler--I just put two like sized pans together with an inch of water in the bottom one. Use a medium heat to start, to melt sugar and incorporate eggs. This protects your eggs. Whisk constantly. Add butter at end, off heat .If you have an instant read thermometer, it should read 175o for finished eggs and a good set. I also added one pinch of salt to sugar and a capful of vanilla at end---just a personal preference.

As many people suggested, I creamed  the butter and sugar together, then added the lemon juice once it was warm. I even tried to incorporate some of the warm mixture into the eggs before I SLOWLY poured them in. Still got cooked eggs. Not a lot, but enough to mar the beauty of the dish. It was disappointing, especially after all the prep and the time I took with it. I will try a different recipe next time, and see what the results are for that.

I made this recipe, and had excellent results--no problem with the eggs not blending into the curd. I imagine anyone with that issue is overheating and not stirring enough. Made it to top my Christmas gingerbread, split and filled with Créme Anglaise. Rather nice concoction for a special dessert!

I've never made lemon curd before, so I looked for the simplest recipe I could find. I also have no patience for double boilers; I was shocked at the bits of egg white left behind - almost 2 Tablespoons!  So glad I strained it! I stirred the butter and zest in with a whisk until the butter was melted and the curd was smooth.  It was like silk! The flavor was nice and tangy - almost too tangy, but I plan to serve it with gingerbread, so it should balance off nicely. It made just under 2 cups. I have to admit I changed the amounts a little bit: 3 eggs + 2 yolks, 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup lemon juice, 5 TB butter, 1 TB lemon zest, packed. I will definitely bookmark this one to use again!

Makes a great lemon curd with a tart kick to it but not enough to make you pucker:)  It is a little on the loose side for a cake filling which is what I use it for but easy to make.  Just be prepared to stand at the stove stirring for a long time.  I have made twice and both times it takes me 20 mins of constant stirring to avoid the scrambled eggs effect.  I cook mine on a 3.5 on my stove, 5 being medium heat.

I really liked it. I combined 2 recipes including this one to make a lemon custard pie. It turned out great!! It was even good for having it in the fridge. Was a huge hit my little brother loved it! Just make sure you whisk the eggs before hand and don't use to much lemon zest

Yum!  I love this lemon curd!  I have never purchased it or made it, but I love lemon, so I thought this would be good, and it is!  I don't use butter (I'm lactose intolerant and butter kills me), so I think it cooked slightly different for me with margarine, but it still worked.  I couldn't get the lemon curd to hold marks from the whisk, but it was coating the whisk and the pan, so I knew it was done, and it was.  It thickened up in the fridge and was full of divine lemony-ness.  I read through the reviews and ended up deciding to temper the eggs, which always works well for me.  I read some of the advice about tempering--it's not that complicated.  Just whisk  the hot mixture into the eggs, constantly whisking, until the eggs are warm, then slowly whisk the egg mixture into the hot mixture on the stove.  My eggs have never curdled, and I've never had to strain them, nor have I ever needed to use a double boiler.  It takes just a few minutes, a little patience, and constant stirring.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe made a really lovely lemon curd, much better than the shop bought lemon curd.  I was pretty nervous about making it so I put it over a double boiler to cook, which took me about half an hour but I knew it would, I'd never made lemon curd before.  I didn't change the recipe except for adding a little more lemon zest.

I used the custard method and this came out great.  It's the most tangy lemon curd I've ever had.  So much better than store bought.  Not too sweet and very lemony.

I just made this and it came out perfect! I made lemon tarts and next will be Lemon Meringue pie. I strongly suggest that you mix the sugar, eggs and butter very well with a mixer until smooth and fluffy then cook all of the ingredients over very low heat  (it will look curdled but keep it on low heat until the curdle is smooth, this is the butter melting into liquid) then cook on Medium stirring constantly until thick or you can swipe the back of the spoon with your finger and a clean trail is left. It's the best I've had besides my Grandmothers.

Good flavour, but I was hoping for a thicker consistency. I'll have to play around with it.

To remove the curdling potential, I used pasteurized eggs -- a common ingredient in our commercial kitchen.  I  just dumped everything in a saucepan,  heated to boil, then let it bubble until I liked the thickness.  I did reduce the butter to 1/3 cup after reading reviews about the curd being too buttery.  I'm using it in Easter Lemon Cheese Pies, so I want it plenty tart to stand up against creamy ingredients.  Ab fab!  Thanks to everyone who reviewed!

Excellent recipe. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and tempered the eggs. I also used a double boiler (pyrex, not metal). A beautiful smooth tangy lemony curd was the gratifying result. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe and super  simple.  I was very surprised at how quickly it set as well- less than the given time at medium heat on my electric range.

Amazing and very simple lemon curd. If you are getting cooked egg white pieces in your curd you are not whisking enough and probably have your heat to high. I made a lower calorie lemon cake (mixing cake mix and 1 can diet cherry 7up) baked the cake in two 8 inch cake pans. When I layered the cake I covered each layer in the lemon curd (kind of undid the whole lower calorie thing but oh well) anyway this lemon curd made my cake amazing!!!! I finished the cake off with some low fat cool whip. It was a big hit at our Easter lunch

This was exactly what I was looking for - like lemonade but goopy, haha! I might have been a *little* generous about the sugar, I didn't want to risk puckering. Very good directions in the comments to help the process go easier, I had never had to deal with tempering eggs before, and this turned out perfectly the first attempt!

OMG!!! This lemon curd is to die for - SO easy and quick, and tastes exactly like the curd my grandmother used to make. I have chickens and a lemon tree - now I know exactly what I will be doing with all the extra lemons and eggs I get!

I love the flavor of this lemon curd.  I've made it a few times now... and it loses a star for method rather than taste and texture.  I have found that when I cook this on the stove in a saucepan it's all too easy to have the eggs curdle, so I've changed methods to the double boiler.  This does take about 3 times as long, but makes a sinfully rich, smooth custard.  I add everything but the butter, then once it's starting to get hot enough to melt it, I add the butter a few cubes at a time, letting it mostly melt between addings.  Then I dump the whole thing thru a strainer into another bowl, cause any time you are cooking with eggs, it's best to strain cause there are always a few chunky bits you don't want in your custard.  Love this on crepes, scones, muffins...  with a spoon!  Thanks for a wonderful treat...

This is really good. The real lemon does taste better. I used the lemon curd to use as a topping on a cheesecake it was wonderful. The time it took in the microwave to cook seemed like forever though since I didn't want it to get lumpy . I opened the micro every 30 to 40 seconds for about 15 to 20 min.

This was the first time I've ever made a lemon curd, and it was spectacular.  I love lemon desserts, mind you, but this is so quick and requires minimal ingredients; it would be easy to whip together if you had unexpected guests.  It's lovely cold or hot off the stove.

I sprinkled mine with confectioner's sugar to match some of that tartness.

Oh, this was WONDERFUL!!!  I did this in a double-boiler over med-low heat and had no problems at all with the eggs cooking.  I made a half-batch (used one egg) because I was concerned that my husband and I wouldn't get through a full batch before it went bad, but it was gone within a day!  Next time I'll probably double it - my husband just couldn't get enough!

Nice and lemony and not too sweet.  Make sure you stir CONSTANTLY.  I cooked on low heat for the first while and then med-low to thicken at the end.  I used extra lemon zest.

I didn't use the lemon zest, just the juice. I also used egg beaters instead of eggs, and "I can't believe it's not butter light" istead of real butter. Of course, it was pretty soupy, but made an incredibly tasty lemon sauce. I am sure the recipe as written is perfect lemon curd.

Very, very yummy! This would make a great Lemon Meringue Pie. Had it with the Simple Scone recipe I found on All Recipes along with fresh smashed strawberries.Everybody in the breakroom was salivating. But I was selfish and didn't share the goods. Just the recipe site was all they got from me!

Very lemony!  I am sure this is a great lemon curd.  Maybe I am just not a fan of lemon curd.  I made this for the simple scnoes recipes and it was little too over powering to put on the scnoes which were divine!

I use this recipe all the time.  It has such a good flavor.  It is perfect on scones.  Try this combination...blueberry scones topped with honey butter, lemon curd, and straberry jam.  I can't ever just have one.  Thanks for the recipe.

My lemon curd didn't get thick enough but that was definitely my fault b/c I was afraid of having scrambled eggs.  It is so good and tart.  I used it as a filling to a white cake with whipped cream cream cheese frosting and it was perfect.  I had some curd left over and it was great spooned over the cake adding more of that great lemon flavor!!  Thanks

I'm on a quest to find the best Lemon Curd recipe.  This one is one of the better, and certainly the easiest, recipes I've made. The only thing I do differently (which I learned from making custards for ice creams) is I strain the finished curd through a sieve , into the bowl it  will chill in.

I just made this and it is delicious!! I made just as directed and had no problems.  I whisked from start to finish on medium/low. It took more like twenty minutes rather than six, but no scrambled eggs. I didn't whisk the eggs prior, nor did I temper or use a double boiler. Be patient is my recommendation.

Made it for the first time and followed instructions. Did the cooking in a glass bowl over hot water because I read some reviews about using non-reactive cookware. Took a while as I was very worried about scrambling eggs and had the heat on low. But with patience and eventually slowly edging up the heat, I got the lovely, thickened texture I was hoping for. Nice recipe given you throw it all in at once, just be patient and give yourself time (I took about 20 minutes of heating/cooking).

I've made this about 10 times in the last couple of years. It's super easy. It's come out perfectly every time. I make a yogurt and fruit parfait to take to work for breakfast every morning, and a teaspoon of this lemon curd on each layer of the parfait makes it over the top yummy!

This is absolutely delish! I followed the directions exactly except I used just a bit less sugar. I used 2/3 c sugar. I made this a couple weeks ago and while it turned out perfect, it was just a tad sweet for me. This is SO easy to make.  You have to heat gently/slowly and I stirred continuously. It does take longer than 6 minutes though, at least mine did, about 15 minutes.  Gorgeous delicious liquid gold!!

Perfect lemon curd.  I was taught in pastry class if you like a more refined curd then to pass it through a sieve.

Loved it! I tempered the eggs prior to adding to the heating mixture. It took a lot longer to get thick, compared to the directions in the recipe. :)

This is a SUPER easy recipe.
I used Meyer lemons, zest&juice. 
In a cold pot prior to heating...
I mixed the sugar and lemon zest & juice, then I added the eggs and whisked everything together then added the cubed butter.
I cooked on electric stove on med-low heat constantly stirring with a whisk... it took 10mins to cook, I think it went slower on the electric stove, I didn't want to turn up the heat and burn the curd...but this was PERFECT curd, perfect balance in tang and sweet... not too sweet not too tangy, just right! This recipe yielded about 14oz of curd... I will double the recipe next time.

Creamed the ingredients before adding lemon juice and used 5 Tb butter instead of a whole stick- took about 15 minutes to get the right consistency but it was very good!

This is a nice tart lemon curd.  I made the recipe as written but next time I would temper the eggs into the mixture.  Using a sieve will get any egg particles out for a smooth curd.

This is very easy to make. I followed the  ingredients of the recipe but heated it at a medium low setting until the butter had melted. I whisked it continuously, gradually increasing the heat to medium. It was perfect and will taste wonderful over gingerbread cake tonight.

make sure to temper your eggs, do not just add them right away melt the butter, lemon juice and sugar until the sugar is dissolved and then slowly add the mixture into a separate bowl while risking constantly, then add back into the saucepan and cook on very low while whisking frequently until thickened

I love this lemon curd recipe!  I make it about once twice a month  and keep it stored in a mason jar in the fridge.  It's perfect for cheesecake and other deserts as well as a topping for yogurt.

Made 1/3 of recipe per husband's rec as whole recipe was not used within the week.  Kids did not like zest so made without and used lemon juice from concentrate.   Be sure to whisk in the egg to avoid egg white clumps.

Easy and delicious! I did turn up the heat to medium until it started to thicken and lowered it to medium-low. I didn't see any scrambled eggs in my curd, but I was also stirring the whole time.

I used the squeezings of full sliced lemons - so there was a good deal of pulp - which took the place of the grated lemon zest.  The remainder of the ingredients are the same as directed in the recipe.  It turned out fabulously!  This is the best recipe for lemon curd I've ever made.  It did take a little more than 6 minutes for my version to come to the right consistency, but that could have been due to the fact that I had a bit more lemon liquid to begin with.  

Wonderfully flavorful and a nice texture - not clear like some recipes since there is no cornstarch thickener - which I actually prefer the texture of this recipe over that other thinner clearer version.

This recipe is a KEEPER and I'll be making this one again soon :)

Sooooooo good and easy to make. Since there is only one of me, I reduced the recipe by 2/3 and it's the perfect amount to make my blueberry ice cream amazing.

I have never made lemon curd before, so I was looking for something easy. This recipe did not disappoint. Such wonderful tartness and flavor. I used it for a cake filling so I added a little corn starch mainly because I didn't know whether it would be runny (my lack of experience showing there). Great recipe!

Oh dear! 3/4 cup lemon juice is WAY too much. It was so tart, I puckered every time I tasted it. I also stirred and cooked for over 20 minutes and it never became as thick as I thought it would. Per the reviews, I used only the yolks, and added the butter in small pieces at the end (like I do when I make lemon meringue pie filling). I hate to say that I threw the leftovers out - no one wanted them :(

I made this as directed except I took others input and upped the butter to a half a stick.  This is why I'm only giving it 4 Stars.  I should have just went with the original because it was a little buttery but still delish.  Next time will follow as written and see what I get.

I bow to the talent of the recipe creator if she got lovely classic curd with this method. 
I followed the instructions provided by SIDCAES in the Most Helpful Positive Review below, and it worked beautifully. Time consuming, but effective. 
I did make one modification. Ann Hodgman,  in her cookbook "Beat That", gives the secret to great lemon squares: limes. I substituted limes for about 1/2 of the lemons (juice and zest). 
My British neighbor thought it was the best curd he'd ever had. 
FYI for WW members: 1 TBS of the curd = 2 pts

I made this exactly as written, and it yields an excellent lemon curd. I plan on using it as a filling for a lemon layered wedding cake.. FYI it should take 5 large lemons to get 3/4 cup of juice. If you don't have a juicer,  you can use kitchen tongs to squeeze the lemon you will be able to get more juice.

Excellent lemon flavor.  I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch initially since I was putting it between layers of white cake and topping the curd with fresh raspberries and I didn’t want the curd to ooze out.

Ok, I'm amending my review. Apparently (and I didn't realize this) my grocery story gave me "light" orange juice with fake sugar in it, and that affected the end result significantly. I made this again with Minute Maid orange juice and it is AMAZING! It has a beautiful orange flavor and is buttery and silky. I could not be happier! My sincere apologies on my angry review from late last night... The moral of the story: don't use juice with fake sugar...

Made this today. Twice. Followed the recipe exactly and the curd broke. Both times. It is supposed to be a component of an Easter dessert and now I'm screwed. It has a lovely flavor, but I can't use a broken curd in a trifle. 

Could it possibly only need the egg yolks and not the whites? Using whites too makes no sense to me for a custard-like food. I'm really frustrated and it is late. I really wish this had worked!

A lot of people have mentioned the concern of scrambling the eggs, I have made this recipe several times and have found that the best way to do it has been to use only the yokes, in a custard like recipe like this the whites should not really be used at all. And if you are worried about wasting the whites, you can always make a delicious lemon macaroon using the whites and with the curd in the middle.

I made this today and it turned out perfect and tasted better than store bought lemon curd.  It took 20 minutes whisking the hole time though to set properly. Maybe I had the heat on to low.  Made about one small jar's worth.

I added more squeezes of lemon and more zest. I also used buttermilk as I had some leftover from a different recipe. It turned out really good. I mixed it in to bread pudding and it was great.

Exactly what I was hoping for - & beyond! I *did* substitute the butter with non-dairy butter (amazing stuff made by Miyoko's) due to my 8-year-old grandson's asthma. This was my 2nd (but 1st successful!) attempt. I'd followed a different recipe the other time. Huge thanks to user/reviewer SIDCAES for spot-ON directions to not curdle the eggs. I used a "homemade" double-boiler. Wow! Belongs in the melt-in-your-mouth category :).

It really is good!  Just as the description - rich and tart.  I made it exactly as written, with the exception of olive oil for butter  as we're dairy-free, and it was amazing!  So simple.  I did take one reviewer's suggestion and added each ingredient/egg one at a time and let it cook slowly so the egg didn't cook.  Takes a bit of time but it worked for me.  This is now my lemon curd/custard/pie filling recipe.  Going to try to add meringue and an almond flour crust next, but honestly, I've been eating this straight out of the jar for a treat!

Not bad, but a bit too heavy on the butter for my taste. I put all of the ingredients, minus the butter, into the blender to make sure the eggs were perfectly mixed, then cooked everything in a double boiler to avoid scrambled eggs. Once my lemon curd was finished I poured it through a strainer into a container to make sure any stray chunks didn't make it in.

I made this with a sugar substitute to put over sugar free lemon cheesecake that just wasn’t quite tart enough. It really hit the spot and was easy to make. I did appear to not thicken as much as I would have thought while on the stove but it did thicken up nicely after it cooled. I had decided it would be a good sauce if it didn’t thicken but it did NOT disappoint. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was a hit!

I have tried other recipes before and I really liked this one a lot. I am going to continue making this version from now on. I just strain it to get any egg and zest out and it is so great!

I make this time and again.  I temper the eggs and I don't add the zest until after I remove from the heat.  Let sit a few minutes and strain.

Terrible instructions. I took the cautious route and stirred frequently on LOW heat and still ended up with a couple of specs of cooked white (didn’t ruin it for me). To address others who felt it wasn’t thick enough - I don’t think this should be used as a filling for a recipe. It’s far too runny, but I think it’s meant to be so. Try adding corn starch if you are going for a thick filling.

Great sweet-tart flavor. I mixed all of the ingredients together except the butter.  I cut it in cubes and mixed it in after  the other ingredients were mixed together.  I cooked it in a glass bowl over simmering water. It took about 20 minutes for the curd to thicken. i did have to strain it to get the few pieces of cooked egg out.

I made it but with the changes recommended in comments -- tempering the egg/sugar mixture with the hot lemon juice and zest.  After mixing I then added the butter in 1Tbsp chunks -- stirring constantly.   Delicious!  BTW, it took me only 3 lemons to get the 3/4 cup of lemon juice but YMMV :D

While the combo of ingredients made it taste great, the curd never solidified after over 24 hrs of refrigerating. I brought it to a temp where the whisk was covered with thickened curd and a few bubbles were seen. Then I took it off heat to cool but it stayed liquid. Odd.

If I make it again, I would use only egg yolks, and beat them before adding. Then add them before it gets too hot, or temper the eggs. 
It’s nice and tart though!

Lost my best lemon curd recipe, so I decided to try this one. 
Big mistake!  I've made lemon curd before and never had a problem.  Like others, I had bits of cooked egg whites.  Horrible.  Will not be using this recipe again.

Delicious and easy to make. However, mine wasn't ready in 21 min. It took forever!!  I heated the juice and butter over the double broiler and added it to the eggs and sugar PAINFULLY- SLOWLY then returned it all to the double broiler and stirred a very very long time 20-30. Next time I'll use a little less sugar, still a bit to sweet for me.

I’ve made this many times now as a cupcake and cake filling. The flavor is a very balanced sweet/tart combination that gets compliments every time. I have put it in carrot cake and plain yellow cake with equally great reviews each time. My favorite way to cook it is by mixing together all ingredients thoroughly first with the butter softened. Don’t worry if the butter isn’t perfectly mixed in, it will melt and mix in on the stove. Whisk diligently while it’s all combining on the stove. Remove it from the stove when it starts to thicken a bit and make sure you refrigerate overnight with a Saran Wrap touching the surface of the lemon curd so it doesn’t develop a film on top.

Great flavor, but I read the other reviews too late to avoid the cooked eggs bit. Live and learn, but it would have been nice for the directions to include what the more informational reviews include. 

As it is, I used my strainer to remove the egg whites and it seems fine despite that little hurdle!

Argh I wish I would have read the reviews first, but instead I just followed the recipe instructions. I definitely ended up with scrambled egg whites in this. I was able to strain most of them out, but unfortunately that process removed much of the lemon zest too. Next time I'll be mixing first and cooking second!

I’ve used this recipe several times and it tastes great! However it has never thickened in 6 minutes, and rarely thickens to the point where whisks marks appear. I will continue to use the recipe but will try others’ advice about amount of butter and tempering eggs. Taste is 5 Stars ??

Omit the zest and use 1/2 stick butter=1/4 cup. To avoid any cooked egg bits, cream the butter and sugar then add eggs one at a time mixing well after each. Then add lemon juice then heat. Takes about 15-20 minutes to thicken, stir constantly.

Oh, my...this is fabulous!!  I multiplied the recipe to serve 200 for a ladies tea luncheon and made it in 4 batches.  Have the butter and eggs at room temperature. I made no changes to the recipe, however, the trick is to add one egg at a time after you blend the butter and sugar together, then add zest and juice.  Cook slowly, stirring constantly, in a double boiler.  This time and patience  produces a wonderful smoothness without egg issues or straining necessary.  Start on really low heat to avoid eggs overcooking and then build the heat a bit as it begins to thicken and butter is melted.  
Do not use a metal container for the double boiler; that will create a reaction with the lemon juice and impart a metallic taste.  I used my slow cooker liner over a pot of water and it worked perfectly.  I also made clotted cream from Allrecipes.  That is super easy and such a wonderful addition.  I special ordered the non ultra pasteurized cream from Whole Foods for best results.

Very easy I used a stainless steel  double boiler, no metal taste, used xylitol for the sugar and mixed the egg sugar and lemon together and poured  over the chunked butter. Let melt as it heated up, never curdled stirred constantly. Very easy

I just took the advise from other reviews and combined everything before cooking, turned out awesome. Was so easy to make, will be made again.

I made this as a topping for a lemon meringue cheesecake.  It was pretty simple and was delicious.  Very tart! 

I creamed the ingredients together before heating, and there were no issues with the eggs curdling.  Instead of lemon zest (I think it is bitter and leaves "pieces" in the food which I don't care for), I used Goodman's Natural Lemon Flavoring. 

It definitely took much longer than 6 minutes to get to the "whisk mark" stage.  I did stir continually.  But I expected that, so it was ok.

I'll keep this recipe!

Be sure to read the top reviews.  It requires a little more effort (whisking) and time than the recipe calls for.  Came out flawlessly nonetheless.

Fantastic lemon curd. Super easy to make. I did it in a double boiler, and it took forever to thicken. If I were to do it again, I would just do it in a thick bottomed pot.

For ease this was great. I put all ingredients in the pot and tempering not an issue.  I will say this was so sour it puckered my mouth, jaws and spine.

I improvised with the directions as some complained of egg bits. I heated up all ingredients except the eggs in a pan. Just at boiling point, I whisked a little of the mixture, starting with one tablespoon at a time and then slowly pouring it into the beaten eggs. After combining both,  I put the whole mixture back on low flame and stirred for a couple of minutes until it thickened. Maybe that wasn't all necessary but it turned out perfect - smooth & creamy with no lumps!  And I didn't have to stir for 15-20 minutes like some of the reviewers my method entails less work :-).

This tastes amazing warm! I put a dollop of it on ice cream.  Also great just by the spoonful with a square of chocolate in between!! Lemon heaven.

Lovely silky-smooth texture, delightful lemony tang-my Go-to recipe for lemon curd. Have tried Chef John’s lower-calorie version and that’s also great but this has a slight edge-hmm...wonder why? Make it once or twice a year and you’re fine, providing you’ve got excellent self-control of course.                                                                            For clarification on this recipe, I: heated the lemon juice and zest using the double-boiler method, removed from heat. Creamed together sugar and butter. Whisked in one egg at a time until evenly combined, then added that mixture to the hot lemon juice pan and whisked over larger pot with boiling water at medium heat for about 8 minutes. Constant whisking and keeping an eye on the heat so the water’s not boiling to hard helps. No cooked egg issues. I started to notice a slight change in smell toward the end which may have meant that egg was getting to hot-tune your nose to sense it and watch bubbling. Turn heat down if that’s happening to quickly and you’ll be fine. Great recipe!

Yesterday, I made 3 different Lemon Curd recipes and this one won the prize.  The texture and taste was just like my English friend's batch she gave me over Christmas.  My husband told me it was just like his "mum" made for him.

No changes needed except to extend the cooking time.  
This is a great tasting curd but the key here is LOW HEAT cooking.  When the heat is too high the eggs cook before they thicken.

I creamed butter and sugar then added the rest of the  ingredients in a mixmaster to blend well. An extra egg yolk for color. To cook, use a double boiler! Never have an issue with curdling. To cool well and quickly, use an ice or at least cold water bath and whisk to not have evaporation issues. Great recipe and I use it for my small catering business

I made this with Meyer's lemons and it is stunning. It didn't act like the recipe said while cooking and while cooling I thought it would only be pourable. But once is spent the night inthe fridge it was marvelous. I highly rec using Meyer's.

You should beat your eggs in  a separate bowl. Heat  all other ingredients in a double  boiler.  When hot  ladle some into the eggs  to temper  them. This will stop  the eggs from scrambling.  Whisk the eggs and  then pour  into the heated pot and heat until thicken.

The changes I made were, I reduced the eggs to 2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk, beaten and set aside. I them cooked the lemon, lemon zest and sugar to 150 degrees .  Then while straining, I tempered the eggs with the warm lemon mix. After the eggs were tempered I put them in the pan and brought the mixture up to 180 degrees. At this time I removed the pan from the heat and added the butter I had diced and kept chilled..

Yummm!!  Did some slight tweaking:  I usually never have lemons, so I used 3/4 cup real lemon juice concentrate.  I also used 1 cup of sugar, only 3 Tblsp butter, the 3 eggs and 1 tsp cornstarch.  Lots of patience, whisking over low heat.  If you are inexperienced in cooking, I would suggest you read up on making custard, as this is very similar.  Heavenly stuff.....I got about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cup of curd from this recipe.  I'm using it to fill my Danish pastries in the morning.

I followed the instructions by Sidcaes to temper the eggs, and it was perfect.  Made it for a toping to a lemon cheesecake.  Our daughter in Arizona sent us some lemons, and the cheesecake and lemon curd toping were a great hit.  Already have lemon juice ready to make the next batch.

Super easy and delicious!  It was perfectly tart!  I mixed the zest with the sugar, creamed it with the butter, added the eggs one at a time (beating between each one), and stirred in the  juice.  Then I heated it slowly, stirring the entire time until it reached desired consistency (about 170 degrees).  I was a bit worried at first because it looked almost curdled, but once it started to heat up it turned perfectly smooth.  I was very happy with this and will use it again in the future.

I followed 'SIDCAES' cooking instructions and it came out with a great consistency. Overall a bit too lemony and tart. Might need a touch more butter or sugar...

Made it in a guilt free way.  Used splenda and completely omitted butter.  Tasted GREAT!  Perfect amount of tanginess (don't like too sweet lemon curd...)  But, this recipe doesn't make much of curd.  You may wanna double or triple depends on what you're making with it.  (not sure simply doubling/ tripling the recipe would work or not....)

I do not change even one miniscule thing about this recipe.  For a lemon lover, this curd (pudding) is simply PERFECT!  Perfect flavor, perfect texture, and keeps well.  I love it and wish I could eat it every day!  I use mostly to make Lemon Lush instead of boxed pudding.  I'm guessing it makes about 2-3 cups and I  always double the recipe, which takes about 10-12 lemons.

It came out perfect! The only thing is that the recipe said six minutes of cooking. It was more like 20 minutes of cooking and constant stirring for me. But that could be because we have an electronic stove?

Absolutely wonderful traditional lemon curd, nice and tangy and not too sweet. I used a double boiler and thanks to the excellent advice from the reviewer SIDCAES on tempering the eggs, it was a complete success -- no "scrambling" whatsoever. Once the lemon curd has been chilled in the fridge for several hours and is really cold, you can fold whipped cream into it for an extra-decadent cake filling. (I measured 1 cup of un-whipped cream for this amount of lemon curd.)

Perfect combo of sweet and tart. I used the tempering method suggested by SIDCAES and it came out perfect the first try.  I also used salted butter cause that's all I had but it would probably be even better unsalted. Delicious as a curd but it also worked beautifully as a cake filling after adding a half packet of plain gelatin. Rave reviews from the group.

I've made this several times before; it's so delicious and so easy!  This time, it was a last minute thing -- so I didn't have any fresh lemons for juice or zest!  I used just the RealLemon lemonjuice I had (full strength, not concentrated) and it turned out just as good... well, fresh lemons are better, and the zest add such a nice touch, but it was what I had to work with on Christmas Morning!

I consider myself a pretty good cook but this just didn't turn out for me. Maybe it was because it called for 3 whole eggs instead of just yolks? I was very careful with my heating and stirring and still ended up with scrambled eggs in my curd and it was very runny. I had the good sense to fix it, but, by following the recipe exactly, I would only give it 1 star. I fixed my mess by running the lemon product through a sieve to strain out the scrambled eggs, then I tempered in 4 egg yolks. After a little more cooking it thickened up, but it really did take a lot of doctoring. It has a wonderful lemon flavor and is pretty simple, but, like I said, I wonder if that was supposed to be egg yolks, not whole eggs.

It was really good, I used a double boiler ( a large glass bowl over a sauce pan, make sure the water isn't touching th bottom of th bowl) and I cooked it low for most of the time, it didn't take 6 minutes for me, wait until it coats the back of a spoon pretty well and when u run your finger through it stays, I would suggest watching a show when you're stirring it, it makes the time go faster, also I drained it through a sieve but the egg white wasn't bad for me at all, it was a small amount but see how much yours does and strain accordingly. :)

I did make a tweak to it though. I was trying to figure out how to make a thicker base for my freshly picked wild blackberries, so I made this and put a few of my blackberries in it. A pleasant surprise. I will be folding this into my heavy whipping cream and the end result will be fabulous!! Happy Fourth of July everyone!

I made this, using advice from the user PEACHY28, I creamed the butter and sugar together, added eggs one at a time, and then added the lemon zest and juice. I made it in such a large batch that when I added the juice, I thought I'd failed and "cooked" the eggs with the acidity of the lemon juice. The juice and butter/egg/sugar mixture didn't mix almost at all, making it look chunky and disheartening. However, as soon as I put it on heat, it smoothed out perfectly and it ended up very well. It tastes really good, and I have a very large batch of lemon curd now. Definitely worth it the "Perfect" title.

Great recipe, just be sure to add a bit of the hot liquid to the eggs at a time so that you don't cause the eggs to scramble.  I will definitely make it again, as I like using the whole egg rather than just the egg white.

I doubled the recipe, but reduced sugar to 1 1/8 C sugar and 
1 1/2 sticks of butter plus 1/8 t. salt since I used unsalted butter.  Was yummy!!!

I love this easy recipe!  I mixed everything with a beater then put it in an 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup. I then placed it into a pot filled with water and heated it. It took a half an hour on med high so I poured it directly into a pot over medium to finish it faster.  I used 3 lemons and all the zest from them and it is fantastic!  Next time I will just do it directly in a pot on the stove. Yummmmm.

Worked great!  I followed the directions....took a little longer than 6 minutes, but it set up perfectly for my cake filling.  At first it did look like the eggs were cooking, but I had on low heat and kept stirring. Keep stirring and it blends together. Do not turn up heat.

Kept ingredients and amounts the same.. However I did temper the eggs. 
I feel this is a necessary step to ensure you don't end up with lumps of scrambled eggs..
Taste was just what I was looking for.

This was my first try at lemon curd and it couldn't have been easier! I set the eggs out for about 15 minutes prior to starting in order that they could temper a little I also mixed everything but lemon juice together prior to adding heat and stirred continually. I think I cooked mine about 8-10 minutes to get a little thicker consistency.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I combined all of the ingredients in a pot, then heated them all together on a medium low heat until thick.  I did not have any issues with the eggs scrambling.  As others have stated you have to heat it slow or the eggs will scramble.  I served this with homemade cranberry scones and it was a huge hit!

Simple and delicious.  I made it exactly like it is written.  I just put everything in the saucepan and cook on medium-low and whisk the whole time.  Never had any issues.  I like to make it the night before so it is cool and serve it with cranberry scones.  Excellent recipe!!

One star less ONLY because of poor instructions, the recipe does not instruct to temper the eggs... YOU NEED TOO!! Otherwise this recipe would have 5 stars. I made this for a "ladies tea" along with some scones. I was the hit of the party with this lemon curd. Ladies went back just to get a scoop of this and eat with a spoon. It has the perfect tart to sweetness balance!

Tempering the eggs is key! So is cooking this in a double boiler set up with a glass bowl. Otherwise the curd tastes metallic. I did this with Meyer lemons (incredible!!!) and lemon lime (tasted like key lime). Gonna try tangerines and orange. But just remember to adjust sugar based on sweetness of the juice.

I used all organic ingredients and some we grew here at home. I love the exquisite tartness of this recipe. I layered it into phyllo shells with a Sweet Mascarpone cream which I also made from organic scratch ingredients....garnished with berries and a mint sprig....and wow....thanks for posting this recipe.

This was absolutely perfect. I used it for a filling for crepes, rolling the crepes with this as a filler. family loved it. Hands down just the way the nice bakeries taste. The review that I found the most helpful was this: "I read a lot of reviews with concerns about 'scrambled eggs' which is common when eggs are cooked too quickly. As a pastry chef I always temper the eggs. Here's how to do it: Combine the juice and zest in a double boiler and heat until hot, not boiling. If you don't have a double boiler, a metal bowl atop a saucepan filled with water works just fine, just make sure it's stable. Have the eggs in a separate bowl, and mix in the sugar just before adding the juice. When the juice is hot, SLOWLY pour some over the eggs and sugar while whisking. This may take two people, but a towel under the egg bowl will help it from moving around. You don't have to pour all the juice, just enough to make the egg mixture the same temperature as the juice. Pour the egg mixture back into the juice over a strainer. This will get rid of any eggs that may have curdled. Then cook over medium-low heat until thick enough to hold the marks from the whisk. Finally remove the curd from the heat and add the butter a little at a time, stirring to help it melt. I hope this helps anyone concerned about curdling eggs!"

Let me begin by saying I have NEVER made anything like this before.  I was very concerned when I read some reviews about "egg lumps"  :-O.  However, I took the challenge and made this anyway.  I am so very, very glad I did. I LOVE lemon curd and wanted to make my own, I followed the recipe, placing all of the ingredients in the sauce pan at once. However, being terrified of over cooking the eggs,  I started with the flame on my gas stove as low as it could possibly be, without being off.  Stirring constantly, I SLOWLY I raised the flame height, so this recipe took me about a total of 30 minutes to make. Yet, there were zero over cooked egg bits and the taste was "out of this world" Amazing!  Thank You so much for sharing. I will be making Lemon Curd A  Lot!  :-)

Just a tip, cook the curd in a double boiler like a custard, that's a pot with simmering water in it, and a metal bowl on top (quick easy double broiler) make sure the flames arent licking up the side of the pot and you will have minimal scorching/curdling. In Addition, for a more set but still oozey curd (for pies, tartes, ect.) add 1/2 cup of Agar Agar molecular stabilizer for a great turnout!

Read the 1-stars and decided to give it a go anyway.  I DID add 1/4 cup of sugar bringing the sugar up to a full cup.  I whisked my eggs BEFORE I put them into the pan with the lemon juice, sugar and butter.  It did take a little longer than 6 minutes to get to the thick consistency you would expect, but other than that it tastes GREAT and I would say the recipe is pretty fool-proof.  I'm going to make egg in a cloud meringues and put this in in place of the egg yolk and we'll see what happens with THAT.  As for the basic recipe, this one's a keeper!

I've made this twice now. 1st in double boiler concerned about the curdling and 2nd in pan on low heat. I'm guessing the "curdling" people have had trouble with was actually the butter. Until it slowly gets warm enough to melt it looks like the curdling of scrambled eggs. Low and slow is key. Have patience and that "curdle" will melt into a nice smooth consistency.

Just like the name of it, it's PERFECT!  I've made other recipes I found online & this is by far the best. Definitely dissolve everything but the eggs first.  Gradually add already scrambled eggs after taking the mixture off the burner.

This is a great curd.  Holds up well, doesn't sweat, and is very tangy, which I love.  I made it 2 days before and refrigerated to use in mini pies.  Note, to avoid the egg issue do the following:  melt the butter (in the microwave) and then put all ingredients but the eggs in a sauce pan. Use an immersion blend (or whisk) to blend everything and then add one egg at a time blending thoroughly.  After everything is blended, then bring it to a boil.  By incorporating the eggs first, you will avoid the boiled egg issue.

This is a really great recipe and is lovely and incredibly tasty every time. However,I would definitely suggest leaving the heat on low the entire time. Otherwise, the eggs cook too much and you have to sift them out. It's a bit like eggnog in that sense - don't overcook it! :) Otherwise, this is an amazing recipe.

Prepared this exactly as directed. It was super simple and the flavor was good, but I didn't like the texture with the zest in the curd. Next time, I will leave the butter out until after I can make tracks in the curd with the whisk. Then, I'll strain it, add the butter, and throw it into the blender or food processor. I've made curds before using this technique and have liked the texture much better.

Better than my English mum used to make!  I doubled the recipe - except the butter (left it at 1/2 cup) and sugar (used 1 1/4 cups). I mixed juice, eggs & sugar and cooked on low but it took about 20 minutes. I added the butter and zest when it was done and off the heat.  My children loved it and my 12 year old daughter said it was better than chocolate!  I used it for an anniversary cake filling and it was a HUGE hit.

I bake quite a bit, and this was a first try success.  I had leftover egg yolk from a cake, so I used 4 egg yolks + 1 whole egg.  It turned out perfectly.  I didn't have any trouble with the egg cooking too fast as several reviewers mentioned.

Excellent and super easy. It really does require constant stirring to make it set right without lumps. The taste was delicious and perfect with scones.

Follow the suggestions by SIDCAES and this recipe works beautifully.  This was my first attempt at making curd and it was very easy. Tempering the eggs is key.  I also followed the suggestion and reduced butter to 1/4 cup. Thank you for a terrific recipe.

I was trying to conserve on the amount of eggs I was using, so I tried this recipe. I had the pot on super low, but I still got 3 spots of scrambled egg whites, so strain it. I'm a pretty good chef, so I think the scrambling has to do with the temp control for beginners, but also with how many egg yolks vs egg whites the recipe uses. I used another recipe before and didnt have any scrambled. I like my lemon curd tart, so I added more lemon juice and a 1/4 cup of lemon zest. Kept the sugar the same. Will make again.

this is a very good, simple recipe. It's i tiny bit lacking in flavor so suggest adding about 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract. It make ALL the difference...

I followed the recipe to a T and it is just right. A nice mix of tart and sweet and the color is beautiful. This is THE curd recipe to follow, especially since it doesn't require extra setting time. So perfect that I featured it on my cooking blog, GoodDinnerMom.com

I just made this and it is perfect! I wanted a tart lemon curd and this is just right. However, it took way longer than 6 minutes to cook. Mine took more like 20 minutes to get the right consistency.

The butter really overpowered the lemons, making it taste too buttery. It's best to strain it to make sure you get a really smooth lemon curd and then add the zest as the final step.

I have never made anything like this so I was extra cautious, but it turned out great! Sure, it did cook an hour but I really wanted it to wor out. I think I can cook it quicker next time. I creamed the butter and sugar together first, as others had said, then added the eggs one by one. Next I added the lemon ingrediants, cooked it low, and stirred it constantly. Very impressed with myself!

Makes a good, easy lemon curd. Nice balance of tart/sweet. I had to cook mine for way longer than 6 minutes to get it to thicken. Maybe next time I will use the same recipe but use Meyer lemons. I did not temper the eggs and it was just fine. Just heat it slowly. Great topping for ice cream, angel food cake, cheesecake....

The lemon curd made from this recipe is *great*, but the directions are utter  for people who have no experience making colloids like curd or hollandaise sauce (hence my 4-star rating). They do basically encompass what needs doing, but warnings should be added so that inexperienced cooks understand how gently the mix needs to be heated, and how constantly one needs to stir. My recommendations for those of you who haven't had much practice with this kind of sauce: get all the ingredients but the butter whisked thoroughly together, and begin heating them gently (start at low, and gradually turn up to medium-low or *maybe* even medium) in a heavy pan with just one tablespoon of butter in the mix. When that melts, start adding the rest of the butter about a tablespoon at a time, letting each piece incorporate before adding the next. Once it's all in, just keep stirring, don't let the heat get above medium, and be patient while it thickens. It takes a while, so make sure you've got at least 20-30 minutes free to cook it.

Yummers !  This is a great recipe and very easy.  I know it says 6 minutes but it took me about an hour of gentle stirring over moderate heat to get the texture fairly thick.  It's not firm but it will go well in a recipe or over ice cream.  I suppose it would get stiffer if I would go longer and maybe I will try it next time.  Got some rare egg flakes but not worried, hardly noticeable.

Very easy recipe! I did have to add additional zest for more flavor because the butter attempted a take over, but it was a wonderful filling for my petite fours.

It came ot very good. I did cream the butter and sugar and than added the lemon juice when it started to get warm. I used a glass pot and it came out perfect. I would make this again.

Decided to double the recipe and used Pyrex bowl in rice cooker to soften butter and cook the lemon curd.  One reviewer said to "temper" sugar, eggs & butter.  Not being sure what that was, I blended the mixture on the "Stir" selection of a Kitchenaid blender.  I tasted the result and chose to add all the zest from all 12 lemons.  Then I slowly cooked in the Pyrex bowl over rice cooker.  No problems with eggs separating and the instructions worked flawlessly.  Pie shells were used to prep for a dessert.  One pie mysteriously disappeared before it was completed.  Success!

When making lemon curd OR custards - simply mix the egg yolks with the other ingredients - then proceed cooking - yes - stirring constantly is important.  This never fails when I make curd or custard.

This tastes awesome!  I didn't read all the reviews before I started or else I would have cooked it on a lower heat.  The recipe calls for 6 minutes.  I cooked it at least 10, it started to thicken but I don't think it's enough.  I will definitely make this again but cut the butter in half for less fat, and the sugar down to 1/2 c instead of 3/4 c.  It tastes really sweet to me.

I made this custard for a birthday gift for someone who considers themselves a lemon custard connoiseur - it was very well recieved.  The four stars is due to methods - I used a double boiler to heat the lemon zest and juice first, wisked the eggs with the sugar seperately and temepered the eggs before adding them to the double boiler and getting it thick that way.  I made the Butter Flaky Pie Crust and served it with fresh blackberries on top.  FANTASTIC!!  Thanks!

I don't know what went wrong here.  I have made lemon curd in the past.  I never had a problem with it.  I mixed everything off the heat (in a glass bowl) then placed over a pan of simmering water and whisked until thickened.  It LOOKED wonderful.  It tasted AWFUL!  I don't know what happened!  I used fresh lemons, fresh eggs, added a little extra sugar...it had a metallic taste.  My whisk was metal.  That's the only metal that was used.  I've never had this problem with my whisk before.  I think I'll just go back to my old lemon curd recipe.  This one just didn't work for me.  Sorry!

This was very easy to make and has a wonderful balance of tartness and sweetness - I mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl first - first the butter and sugar and then added the eggs and then the lemon - as was suggested by another person on here - it worked really well and then all you have to do is heat it till it thickens! Great recipe!

This is the best. I use it all the time to make lemon tarts and also use it as a spread on tea biscuits and toast.If it were possible I would rate it a ten.I've given the recipe to my eldest sone and it has become his signature recipe for lemon tarts. Whenever he is invited to a dinner party  ( after many hints )he opts to provide the dessert made with this and boughten tart shells.For a nice quick dessert put  a tart on a dessert plate top with some fresh raspberries and  add a swirl of  melted good dark chocolate around the rim of the tart.

I switched out 3 eggs for 3/4 cup of tofu and used half the sugar. I also added a tablespoon of all purpose flour to help thicken it, and cooked over medium high heat. There were curds of tofu left after it thickened, but just pour it in the blender and blend till it's smooth. It was awesome.

Consistency turned out really well.  Flavour a bit tart for my liking on scones (or eating with spoon), but will keep for when I want a more tart lemon curd.

I am not sure what went wrong. I followed the directions to a T, and this came out soupy, it did not thicken on the stove at all. Maybe the directions need to be altered to give it a longer time to thicken. 

Another problem I had was when I put this in the fridge to thicken and cool, the butter separated from the curd and formed a hard butter "shell" over it.

I was going to use this in a lemon cake for the filling but I can't have junks of butter floating in it. 

Also- I thought this should be a smooth and silky consistency, somewhat like a lemon meringue pie would be, but this was junky and nothing like the lemon filling I was expecting.

I only gave this a 3 for the flavor, great strong lemony flavor.

The flavor of this lemon curd is really good--the three stars are for the incomplete directions.  An inexperienced cook would definitely mess this one up.

I used Peachy28's suggested method and I have PERFECT, creamy, smooth curd sitting in my fridge right this moment.  Thank you!

A great lemon curd.  Wonderfully tart lemon flavour.  It makes a great filling for tart shells.

I made this into lime curd instead and put it on little mini cheesecakes.  They tasted just like key lime pie.  I also used them on lemon scones.  Mine did get a little eggy however I just kept stiring until it was really thick (about 30 mins)
This is a keeper and I will be using it in my store.
