Delicous, and simple.  I did cook it more like a traditional stew, browning the meat, then adding the vegetables, stock and port and simmering for a couple of hours, because that worked best for me time-wise.  Believe it or not, I actually forgot to add the tomatoes at the end, but it was wonderful nonetheless.  The port flavour is quite subtle and pairs excellently with the earthiness of the mushrooms.  Fantastic served with soem fresh, crusty french bread to sop up the sauce.  I will definitely remember the tomatoes next time, and yes, there will be a next time.

I joined this site just so I can rate this recipe!  It's delicious!  If you like garlic - you'll love it.  I served with egg noodles - and it was a hit!

So Easy, And So Yummy!!! My Husband absolutely loved this one. I served it with Sauteed ranch potatoes instead of egg noodles.  Next time I'll stick with the egg noodle though, they'll be better for catching all the yummy sauce. I substituited red wine (shiraz) for the port with no ill efects!

This was really tasty. My grandma makes something like this without the wine. I served with homemade egg noodles and edamame.

I thought this was really good! I used venison instead of beef but otherwise I followed it to a "T"! I didn't have egg noodles on hand so I served it with basmati rice over a bed of spinach. My fiance thought it was "interesting" and not in a bad way. I quite liked it and thought it was unique.

This was great!  The port was not overpowering at all.  I've tried recipes in the past with wine in it and usually the wine is over powering but the port worked wonders with the meat.  I did omit the sugar snap peas, not fans, and the mushrooms.  I added carrots since I didn't have mushrooms.  Soooo yummy.  Served over mashed red potatoes!

This was just ok.  It was very boring, not a lot of flavor.  I felt like it was missing something.

Very good.  The only thing we didn't have was port wine so we used beer instead but otherwise didn't change the recipe.  The cherry tomatoes were from our garden but picked green over two months ago (before the frost hit) then ripened in the basement and they added a lot of flavor.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I did have two beef seasoning packets left from using the ramen noodles in a salad the day before that I used to make the beef broth, and I added more garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

This had a pretty good flavor, but I wouldn't recommend the peas.  I left the sugar snap peas in their pods and we didn't like that very much.

Made this the other night using some leftover shredded beef roast. Just put it in toward the end and warmed through. I left out the snap peas, not too crazy about those, and used fire-roasted canned tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. Served it in a bowl over warm polenta porridge. Wonderful winter meal! My entire family loved it, and I plan to make it a staple meal in our home.

This was very good. Easy to assemble; followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Served over rice, but I think I will try it with egg noodles next time.
