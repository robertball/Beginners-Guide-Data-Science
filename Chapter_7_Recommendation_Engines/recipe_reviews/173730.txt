***to the people who want to cook their kale before adding to the recipe, DON'T!  Cooking reduces the nutrient content and DEFEATS the purpose behind a 'green smoothie'  If you don't care for kale, try spinach or add more fruit (up to 60% fruit, 40% veggies) to offset the flavor of the greens.  If you find it too thick, it's ok to add some water to make it your desired consistency.  And if you are adding the flax, I find it best to use ground flax seeds.

This sounded so awful I had to try it!  I was very pleased to find it absolutely delicious.  I will probably cut the amount in half next time (and just eat the remaining banana) as it was very rich.  I also used nonfat dairy milk as I had no soy.

I needed to double the amount of milk because my smoothie was so thick!  Also, if you are using a flavored rice/soy milk you don't need the maple syrup to sweeten it.  Blend this for MUCH longer than you would a regular parsley or spinach green smoothie, as kale is very fibrous and you want to make sure to get this as smooth as possibly so you aren't crunching as you sip.  Just my two cents!  Thanks for the yummy recipe, Rice!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written, except that I used cow's milk. It was just okay (three stars). Today I tried it again with a few more changes. In addition to using cow's milk (because that's what I like and what I have on hand), I added a big handful of frozen strawberries, four or five ice cubes, and extra milk. I liked it much better that way . . . both because it was cold and because the flavor was fruitier. It was almost milkshake-like. My little boy (almost 2 yrs old) loved it. With the modifications, this is a four-star recipe.

I use very young kale from my garden and this is a delicious recipe.  The younger the kale, the sweeter the drink.

I love trying to sneak some greens in wherever I can on my whole family especially the kids.  The kids thought it tasted like their was grass in the smoothie, but still ate it.  I cooked the kale until bright green on the next try to tone down the bitterness and it definitely improved the taste.  I will probably make this again but only with the kale cooked.

Amazing!  I make fruit smoothies for my family every morning but never thought about putting something like kale into them!    Used frozen kale, which was really easy, because I just threw a few cubes in the blender along with some fruit, flax seeds, silken tofu and orange juice.   My husband freaked out a little bit when he saw it and said I'd finally gone over the edge, but he admitted later that it tasted fine!  Thanks for helping me find a new way to squeeze more leafy greens into our diet!

this was so good the only thing i changed was the soy milk, i used vanilla rice milk because thats what i had. this is very similar to the green smoothies my mom makes. she uses 1/4 soaked date per serving as a sweetener, i think i might try that next time to eliminate some calories. i didn't think my 3 yr old would like it because of the flax seeds but he drank it right down.

We get a ton of kale with our farmshare, and this is a quick way to use it -- I doubt I'd be buying kale to make smoothies with, but it's a good solution for the end of the week when I've still got kale in the fridge.  I've been making it half-and-half skim milk and orange juice, and I found a frozen strawberry is a good sweetener.     I didn't find a need to cook the kale -- the textures a touch strange, but it's a perfectly nice drink.  Thanks for the suggestion!

This is great for breakfast, I use 1 banana, 2 cups chopped kale, a handful of red grapes, 1/2 cup water instead of soy, a dash of cayenne pepper, and a dash of stevia.  It gives me more energy than coffee.  I have heard that soy is not that good for you, which is why I use water instead.  It turns out great this way!

Yah it sounds really strange! But the kale in the smoothie adds a little bit of freshness to the smothie. I switched it up and used vanilla yogurt with a splash of skim milk instead of the soy milk, then I didn't add the syrup. I also added some ice because I found it was too warm for a smoothie, it probably was the banana being at room tempurature.

Great! I added a packet of stevia instead instead of syrup to keep the sugar content down. Will definitely make this frequently.

This recipe sounded so odd, I had to try it! Glad I did…it’s so tasty!...and I feel so proud of myself for getting in some veggies first thing in the morning. 

I tried the recipe as is, but my favorite is to use vanilla soy and skip the maple syrup. I also slice and freeze bananas ahead of time. Frozen bananas make the smoothie super creamy and cold. Sometimes I leave out the (ground) flax seed – it changes the color from fresh green to a sort of pond scum color which I don’t feel like facing some mornings. It also changes the texture, making it thicker. 

I agree with others…it’s a must to remove the stems from the kale; to blend well to get that smooth consistency, and to grind or use pre-ground flax seeds to get the benefit.

WOW! I have to admit I was surprised by how delicious this is. I was even more surprised that my children AND husband love it as much as I do. My 4 year old hates kale, cries when she see's it on the dinner table and will drink this and ask for another serving. I always use 2 banana's, 1 cup of milk and a Tablespoon of sweetner but some of my other tweaking varies. Honey/agave nectar either one is fine, cow's milk or rice milk both taste fine and I prefer to use frozen banana's but unfrozen is tasty to. I strongly suggest giving this a good whirl in the blender to makethe kale and flax seed smooth. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe Rice!

Fantastic smoothie!  I keep a bag of chopped frozen bananas to use in my smoothies for the chill factor.  I also use agave nectar since that is what I usually have on hand.  Kale is super nutrient dense!

Nothing can really make kale (a ridiculously bitter, naturally disgusting vegetable) taste good except for some syrup/honey and that's exactly what did the trick. Except don't skip out on the sweetener! Overall this mostly kale smoothie is not too shabby.

I was pleasantly surprised by the flavour of this smoothie!  I had rice milk and worked great.  Needed a good amount of blending to make perfectly smooth.

A word of warning to 1st time eaters of raw kale-as I was and learned this the hard way this morning.  It can be pretty hard on the digestive system to the point of nausea.  If your not sure I would recommend trying this later in the day rather than on an empty stomach and in smaller quantities.

A frozen banana would have been much better.  As is, it wasn't at all cold as a smoothie should be.  I added ice cubes to help with this but that of course diluted the flavor.  It was still pretty good, but definitely would do a frozen banana next time and skip the ice.

This is an excellent snack. Very nutritious, packed with vitamin C, and B vitamins.  I added a tablespoon of all natural peanut butter for some added protein, and it was delicious.  Instead of maple syrup, I used a packet of Truvia, or local honey.

I was looking for a natural, light, and not overly sweet tasting smoothie and this was perfect!  All I used was 1 banana, 2 c. chopped kale, 1 c. light vanilla soy milk, and some ice to chill it (though I tried a little before adding the ice and it still tasted great!). Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

This was the worst smoothie/green drink I have ever tasted, BY FAR.  If I could have not given any stars, I would have.  I read multiple positive reviews and decided to try it.  To be honest, the taste and texture were so bad that the only reason I continued to drink it was so as not to negatively affect my 3 and 5 year olds who were also drinking it.  My grandma and mom have both been making green drinks my entire life, and I usually like them.  Never have I felt I could hardly swallow.  My kids, who both love green drinks, finished their small amounts, however, the older one did say it didn't taste as good as others.  She always asks for more, but didn't today.  I'm not one to take time to rate, this is the first time I've done it.  But with this recipe, I had to.  If you want a GOOD green drink, try a different recipe.

I made using spinach instead of kale as that is what DH brought home. That being said this made a nice very light breakfast for us. I might try making it without the maple syrup next time as it was a bit sweet for my taste but DH thought the sweetness was just right. Thanks for the post.

To be fair, I didn't have very high hopes for this recipe to begin with, but I was trying it because I was looking for healthy smoothie ideas for our dinner club.  While it was better than I thought, I didn't like the texture at all and that was probably the biggest drawback.  I did enjoy the interesting flavor that the flax seed and the maple syrup combined made, kind of nutty and breakfasty, but I just couldn't get past the texture, so I will not be making this again.

Just okay. Mixed reviews with the kids. I would add some frozen berries and OJ for extra sweetness  and vitamin C to help absorb the iron from the kale.

I have to admit, I thought the author of this recipe was insane when I read this.  Kale, bananas and maple syrup?  An odd combination it seemed.  It intrigued me enough to want to try it though.  I tried it for the first time 3 days ago and have had it once a day since.  It is AMAZING not to mention healthy.  It has a very smooth taste and is fantastic as a snack when you are not hungry enough to justify a meal.  I would highly recommend this.  And to the author, thank you so much for submitting this!  I now drink this smoothie daily.

My kids love this, believe it or not! They think it's cool to get to add syrup to a smoothie. I think it's cool to get them a serving of green leafs first thing of the day. Thanks, Rice!

This is awesome! I don't particularly like how green kale tastes, but I know that it's very good for you! This smoothie tasted wonderful with some mods like...I didn't put in the stems.  Used homemade almond milk instead of soy and filled it to the 2 cup mark on my vitamix after the kale and banana were put in.  Used 2 T. of agave syrup instead of maple.  Added 5 ice cubes, also.  This tasted great!  It's so good I can't wait to drink it!

the recipe itself isn't great. actually, i couldn't bring myself to put in maple syrup so i'm not sure how much better that would have made it. i immediately had to add more almond milk (i don't use soy) and then threw in some yogurt to thicken it up. it tasted flat and too banana so i added 1/2 mango. still wasn't sweet enough so i added 1/2 c. blueberries and 1/2 pack sweetener (i use truvia). then it was tastey enough to enjoy. i didn't taste the kale at all, just like when making smoothie with spinach. it was fresh, organic kale. good to know i can use this green also but the recipe requires tweaking for sure!

you can't taste the banana and soy milk at all. The problem isn't that it's too bitter, the problem is that it tastes only like kale. I think there *might* be a way to make it better if you cut the amount of kale in half, or add two to three times the amount of fruit and milk.

Next time I'll try it with some raspberries to help sweeten it, and I'll replace the maple syrup with honey.   I doubled the maple syrup, replaced the soy milk with skim, and flax with chia. I can't imagine these substitutions ruined the recipe...

This could be pretty descent or really bad, if it is not fully blended. I used all of the ingredients, except I had to subtitute the soy milk for unsweetened almond milk. I don't care for or have flax seeds, so I used 1 Tlsp. of quick oats. I poured it over the ice and it still tasted warm. So, I put 3 ice cubes into the blender and blended it with it. After about a minute, the smoothie will still have kale bits in it. As someone else said grass bits. If ice is added and it is left to blend for closer to 2 minutes or until it is a complete uniform color, with no green bits, it is pretty descent. If I closed my eyes, I would just think it was a really unsweet banana smoothie. I may make this again, just for the pure health of it.

I used regular milk, instead of soy (due to the negative effects of soy's estrogen-like effect on your body) and flax powder.  Maybe that's why it tasted sooo terrible.  My poor family barely got it down :(

I really wanted to like this...but I couldn't get past the strong kale taste. I used nonfat milk and didn't have any flaxseed (not sure if the flavor would have been very different). Anyway, I feel healthy for drinking it!

I just love this smoothie!  My very picky nieces decided they loved it before they realized they were having kale.  They guessed that kiwi gave it its colour, and I didn't tell them otherwise.  They now know my secret ingredient, and they even enjoy helping me make the smoothie, adding different fruits each time:  blueberries, strawberries, mango...  Kale has got to be the only leafy vegetable they eat, thanks to this recipe!

I was making dinner and jumped on the Internet for a recipe for fresh kale.  I came across this recipe for kale and banana smoothie.  I decided to steam some vegetables for dinner and try this recipe for my fresh kale instead.  
I used plain yogurt instead of soy milk and molasses instead of maple syrup with 4 cubes of ice.  It was delicious.  My blender has been revived and now I will be using this recipes as a basis for a daily healthy drinkable lunch.  Thank you.

Wow!  I was dubious after a failed spinach smoothie I once made, but am so glad I gave this a try!  I used a frozen banana and whole milk and didn't have any flax seeds, and it was amazing!  Almost had an apple sort of taste.  My 14 month old daughter loved it so much, I had to make another one right away so there'd be enough for me!  Thanks!

Just like almost every other reviewer, I am trying to fit more veggies into my diet and as I can't stand V8...I thought I would give this a try. So much better than I could have imagined, great smoothie & holy cow was it filling...I could barely finish all of it. I followed other reviewers advice by grinding the flaxseeds & freezing a ripe banana. I tried not to alter the ingredients much more so to give an honest review. Next time I may thin it a bit with a little water or orange juice before serving & definitely blend it longer to grind up the kale a bit more. Thanks Rice for posting this recipe, so long V8 (yuck)!

I used RAW Kale. Perfect!  I didn't have soy or rice milk, so I used Vanilla Yogurt and "liquified" it with a little orange juice. Great recipe. Thanks.

This was ok after adding more milk, another banana, and some splenda to sweeten it up.  But the kids still didn't drink it.

I really loved this because it is so healthy and chock full of vitamins and nutrients> mine was not sweet because I used an unripe banana but i am sure if i use a ripe banana it would be sweeter> the only thing i changed was using honey instead of maple syrup. nom nom nom!!!!

YUM!! I used green kale (the super curly kind) and did not find it bitter at all. It could help to do half kale, half spinach if you find it too bitter. I don't have any flax seeds (keep meaning to get some of those!) and used honey instead of maple syrup. DELICIOUS!!!

I simply had to try it because it sounded gross. I was surprised that it tatsted pretty good, and my boys were able to eat some because it smelled like bananas.

What a great way to get a good portion of greens down the hatch. I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I really liked it, reminds me of adding wheat grass. My husband thought it was too 'grassy' but that's just not his cup of tea.

This smoothies didn't look very appetizing, but it tasted great!  I used really ripe bananas, almond milk instead of soy, and agave instead of maple syrup.

It does taste like grass as other reviewers noted, but it is surprisingly drinkable. Kale has a strong smell, so it is best to drink it with a straw.

After the birth of my daughter, I became anemic and needed to add more iron to my diet.  With much hesitation I tried this recipe because of the nutritional value.  It was not bad.  I will also only make half next time due to the richness.  The smootie is very filling.

Absolutely delicious.  I enjoy the beautiful color that 2 cups of kale gives to this healthy delicious way to start the day.  I have added 3 oz of yogurt, a few strawberries on occasion, but the original recipe is super.  Thanks for sharing.

This was perfect!  Not too sweet, not bitter.. I didn't have flax seed on hand so used 1 Tlb almond butter.  I made it with the maple syrup the first time and it was very good.  I switched out the syrup for 1/2 apple and I preferred the sweetness of the apple to the syrup.  I also added a few ice cubes to make it icy cold.  This will be my new staple for a green smoothie!

It was good. Next time I will use a date instead of maple syrup and add some water as it was thick. I might try adding berries and chia seeds. 
For the people using cows milk instead of soy milk - why purposely add cruelty to this  nutritious drink?

Tasted good. I added 1 cup of almond milk instead of half and I also added a TBS of peanutbutter.  I liked with with the peanut butter.  It hides the taste of the kale.

This is a good, and quick recipe. Not too sweet and not too bitter. I don't like to pour it over ice cubes, so I freeze the bananas the night before. I've been using unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

Better than expected. kale has a VERY strong taste. I would have added just a half cup less. Also I combined ice when blending a a dash of water to make it less thick. Next time I may also add honey as a sweet alternative. otherwise thanks for the recipe. drink up!

Love this!  I use almond milk because I like the flavor better.  For a frostier smoothie, I freeze a peeled banana and big handful of kale in plastic zipper bags, then each morning pull one out of the freezer.  Really yummy!

I just tried this recipe and added pineapple, left out the maple syrup, used sprouted flax powder instead of flax seeds, and used light coconut milk instead of soy milk (doubled the amount) and added some water. Perhaps I created a totally different recipe altogether, but anyway, it was great!

Interesting! I used regular milk and added 2 tablespoons of powdered peanut butter because I didn't have any flaxseed. I don't think I would have liked it without the PB. I blended the heck out of the kale and couldn't really taste it, but then afterwards I had a weird aftertaste.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Lacinato (Dino) Kale - the dark green variety.  I also added half an apple.  The smoothie has more calories than I like to consume at once,  but it was worth it for the packed nutrition.  It served as a meal for me.  I have a Blendtec so I packed ice in it as well - the texture was perfect - cold, thick, sweet and very tasty.  Thank you Rice for this recipe!

First I added the milk 6 oz vanilla soy milk with the organic kale and 3 ice cubes to blend on high.  I stopped the blender after 90 seconds to add the frozen banana pieces.  I processed on ice crush mode then stopped it again to added the flax seeds, natural maple syrup (tablespoon instead of a teaspoon).  It was delicious!  I'm making another one for breakfast tomorrow morning before I clean the blender.

this was yummy, just what I was looking for. I gave it 4 stars cause I changed it up just a hair. I used fat free milk ( didn't have soy) added some strawberries and sweetened with stevia instead of maple syrup.

Very good with minor tweaks to my taste.  Doubled the soymilk, eliminated flax and maple syrup.  Plenty sweet with just the soy, kale and banana.  A few frozon strawberries are also good in the mix, but not necessary.  Keeper!

I was surprised that we didn't taste the kale!  I used unsweetened almond milk and honey instead of molasses.  I also didn't use the flax seed-one step at a time trying these:)  Kale and banana is a very good mix!  Next I'll try kale and blueberries.  I gave 4 stars because I changed the recipe but guessing I wouldn't care for the soymilk as much.

this is a great basic recipe. I use kale in all of my smoothies now... you can barely taste it and it fills you right up! this is a lot of banana for me the morning, so I modified a little: 1/2 frozen banana (I wait until slightly brown, then freeze them in chunks), 1 cup (about 5 leaves) kale without the stems, 1/4 - 1/3 cup vanilla soy milk, 1 heaping teaspoon of nonfat plain yogurt, a tiny bit of flax seed oil, and then 4-7 pieces of frozen fruit. My favorite is 4 pieces of pineapple and 2 pieces of mango :)

This is amazing. I was skeptical but thought I'd give it a try since it was so simple and I needed to use up some kale.   I make this all the time now, using a sugar free maple syrup. It freezes well, so it's easy to make the night before and put in the microwave briefly in the morning to thaw. Easy breakfast.

I wanted to get my 16 month old to eat more greens - this did the trick :)  My skeptical husband loved it too! I used honey in place of the syrup and vanilla soy milk vs. unsweetened.  Omitted the flax seeds simply b/c I didn't have any.  Yummy.

This was a fantastic way to sneak in your veggies. I made it just as written and everyone (including my kids and my husband) loved it. I've also made it using fat-free milk and agave nectar with fabulous results. Instead of pouring over ice we just add some frozen berries to the mix.

I know the recipe is probably wonderful, but the aftertaste of raw kale was very unpleasant to me.  The smoothie sans kale would be very nice I'm sure.

My smoothie was a little too thick with just half a cup of soy milk. So after adding a more soy milk and adding just a bit more maple I thought it was great.

I plan to try this recipe this afternoon, but have a question.  I normally have a morning smoothie with grinded flaxseeds, frozen banana and blueberries....I also add some cacao nibs.  For this recipe, do I grind the flaxseeds first, Ive never eaten them unground!  Thanks!

This is really quite amazing!  We made it with regular soy milk and 1 T maple syrup, and my 10-year old daughter loved it.  Her comments:
"It was really not bad! I will recommend it to other people.   (:

It was OK I added an extra banana and probably did more of a tbsp. of maple syrup. Since I was the only one who drunk it I'm not so sure I would make it that much. However I have a huge bag of kale to figure out what to do with :(

I thought it tasted lovely. For those who don't like the idea of kale smoothies, this one tastes only like the banana. I didn't have the flax seeds and it still tasted fine.

I used honey, and a little more than a tablespoon. I used basil seeds, and skim milk. Let it sit overnight so the seeds expand. You may need to add more milk.

Good smoothie--made it great by using a frozen banana and adding 3 ice cubes. I left the flax out, just because I wasn't sure if my husband would like it, but I'm sure it would be good in this. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy and istead of maple syrup, I used a packet of Splenda. DH wants me to make this again.

I made this with two DENSELY packed cups of kale and had no issue with it being too think. Used macadamia milk instead. Delicious smoothie that isn't too sweet and heavy on the nutrients! Will be making this again.

This was my first kale smoothie.  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I may not have used quite as much kale as called  - used two handfuls of chopped kale, three ice cubes, some frozen blueberries, half of a banana, a tablespoon of local honey and filled the large ninja container with whole milk.  Blended well - really yummy!  Aside from the odd grayish color from the blueberries.    I used the other half of the banana for a second batch to keep in the fridge for later.

I followed instructions except used almond milk b/c I prefer it. It was just okay. I like kale and am not sure why someone would want to put it in a smoothie-I guess if you don't like kale, to try to disguise it? Regardless it is obviously healthy but I believe kale tastes better in almost any other form.....

So to be fair, this is my absolute first attempt at making a green smoothie.   I didn't have flax seeds, and I can't stand soy milk, so I used coconut milk instead.   I also didn't bother with the maple syrup.  Instead a put in a couple drops of stevia and about 1/2 teaspoon of imitation vanilla.  Surprisingly palatable!

I love it! I used 1% fat milk since I didn't have soy milk. It was my dinner!  and I was satisfied with it! This is going to be my green smoothy from now on. Thank you for this recipe.

Ground flax seeds are a thickening agent. I didn't have any but substituted hulled sunflower seeds. Used kefir instead of soy milk. Also don't care for sweet when there's fat so omitted syrup. Well, it's a different recipe, isn't it. Still good.

I used regular milk and chia seeds rather than flax because that's what I had handy. I was nervous about the whole kale smoothie idea, I have a hard time with the bitterness of kale but I was very pleasantly surprised! It takes yummy and just the right combination of sweet / veggie.

it's actually surprisingly good.  As a food alone, I do not like kale, but it's very good for you. Try it with banana,  you'll be surprised.  The key is to be sure to a add 15 ice cubes and blend.

I liked this a lot. I added a second banana because I'm not a huge fan of kale (but kale is so good for you, I want it for the nutrients!) It made for a thicker smoothie, but balanced the flavor pretty nicely. I also substituted a teaspoon of natural vanilla-infused honey instead of the maple syrup. Overall, I recommend!

I added extra almond milk for a thinner texture, and a small handful of blueberries.  Even though it made the colour a bit muddy, the taste made up for it.  I found that blending for a a long time, and using unsweetened almond milk, made it very tasty.  I will make it again.

This recipe was pleasantly, surprisingly, amazing! I had never had kale before but have seen recipes increasingly pop up everywhere. I only made this with 1 banana, 1.5 cups of kale, .5 cup vanilla almond milk, and some ice. It was great! Will be making this more often!

I loved the recipe it was simple and tastes awesome.  I just decided to add blueberries and honey, and overly ripe bananas because they are much sweeter and gives you something to do with  old bananas. .. ha! I read a comment about why you shouldn't boil kale first. ..

the only changes I made was to substitute the sweetener since I didn't have any maple syrup and no soy so I used unsweetened almond milk. So I added my fav Greek yogurt that's honey vanilla and the recipe was still a little weird. I think greens thicken up your smoothies and adding like a thick liquid would make it too rich for my liking. Maybe it was just the way I made it but It's an eh recipe before I added the yogurt

After two days on the road with nothing but fast food and preserved snack packs to sustain me, my body was rebelling against the complete lack of nutrition it was receiving. Looking for a simple recipe to make with my Nutri-Ninja, I came across this very simple recipe that even I with my severely limited culinary tastes was able to reproduce!

I did make some changes to the base recipe: Instead of soy milk I used almond milk; instead of flax seeds I used chia seeds; and instead of maple syrup I used blue agave nectar. I'm convinced that these changes were slight enough that if made using the actual listed ingredients, the smoothie would come out just as good. As it stands, the smoothie I made was thick, sweet, and totally delicious. A few minutes after drinking it I feel recharged and much better than I did before. So thanks for the awesome recipe!

It comes out a bit thick, but I like that. Perfect amount of sweetness. I used a food processor, which did a good job on the kale.

 GRIND YOUR FLAX SEED FIRST! Your body doesn't fully digest whole flax seed, and the food processor will take too long. 

It feels like a big cup of nutrition. Mature taste buds only; kids probably won't like it.

Tastes great! *****! I used salad greens instead of kale, and almond milk instead of soy milk. If you double the recipe it makes enough for 2-3 people. Good for a breakfast smoothie. Just add extra milk.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I used a whole banana, but when I went to add the kale I realized I bought a bag of Kale & spinach combined.  After adding the soy milk, which mine was not light, but Vanilla to me it didn't seam like it would be enough, but I kept the amount the way the recipe said.  Once tasting the smoothie, I did not like it at all, it was warm and too thick and the maple syrup taste was too much.  I will not make this again

I make green smoothies daily and found that cutting up bananas and freezing them eliminates using ice. I use coconut milk, orange or apple juice as the liquid which works well sweetening the drink. Frozen fruits are also great if you can't use fresh. Almonds are a nice addition too.

Recipe is pretty good. Can use the ice in the shake well. Does not necessarily need syrup. Honey works just as well. Either way a delicious smoothie.

I think I need a better blender. The texture was like a shredded salad. The flavour was good though. I used vanilla almond milk (slightly more than 1/2 cup) and Chia seeds instead of Flax. I will make this again.

This recipe was terrible the first try. I changed it up a bit and now I love it. I used honey instead of maple syrup, 1 cup of soy milk instead of 1\2 cup and added a handful of frozen blueberries. The bitter taste is gone and only yum remains.

I enjoyed this smoothie but I used almond milk instead of soy.  Soy increases your estrogen levels which is not good for anyone.  I stay far away from soy at all times.  Other than that, I added strawberries as well.  It was really good.

I liked this, but the more I drank it the harder it was to get down lol!  I love kale so much, but it had a weird thickness and texture to this, which was the problem for me.  I blended the heck out of it too to make sure there were no small pieces... 
Overall good though for a nice healthy shake!

I can't say I loved it because it is a very healthy raw smoothie but I did like it. The recipe itself is great with the exception that the liquid needs to be doubled. My poweerful blender refused to blend this until I increased the liquid and it was still a thick smoothie. I would make this again for my health.

Made this today, but due to having run out of soy milk this morning I was forced to use regular (fat free) cow's milk. Other than what I am sure is a considerable taste difference between smoothies using the cow milk vs. soy milk, I enjoyed it immensely. I will have to be sure to pick up soy milk and try it again, I'm sure it will be even more tasty.

For a really great flavor freeze the banana and add some cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious! I also sometimes add unsweetened almond milk and for extra protien, nonfat greek yogurt.

Looking at the picture and recipe, I thought I wasn't going to like it and I'm glad I was wrong. You can taste the banana more than anything else and it is actually quite delish .

My 6 1/2 year-old daughter and I just tried this recipe today.  We both loved it.  I substituted a frozen banana to make it more frothy.  Instead of maple syrup we added strawberries and 1T of Agave nectar.  We didn't have any soy so we used regular milk.  Super delicious!

If you can get past the fact that it looks like cream of broccoli soup - it is acually tasty.  Mine needed more milk than the recipe indicated. Also, I used a bananna and a half that had been previously peeled and frozen (that's what I usually use plus more milk).  Also, I like my smoothies with an icy texture so I added approximately 8 ice cubes.

Made it with 2 cups chopped kale (pre-chopped courtesy of Trader Joe's), 1 banana, and half a cup of Almond Milk - Vanilla (again thanks to TJs). SO DELISH! I put the kale in the freezer overnight, and banana in the fridge. tossed all of them together and was really really impressed by how delicious this is. I think this will be my staple breakfast smoothie. 
Will add the flax seeds, but no need for maple syrup for sure.

excellent. i never realized kale would work so well in smoothie form! i've also made this with cow's milk and/or the addition of frozen berries (rather than maple syrup). very versatile.
