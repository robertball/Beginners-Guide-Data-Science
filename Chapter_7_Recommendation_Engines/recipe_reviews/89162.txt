This is a pretty good recipe.  I find the sausage gives it a greasy taste.  I used just lean ground beef.  I also add in 1/2 cup of all bran cereal to absorb some of the extra moisture.  I also put a handful of baby carrots to the bottom of the slow cooker, to raise the meatloaf out of the fat.

Very good.  I made the following changes: I only had ground beef, so I used 2 lb.  Instead of ketchup on top, I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  I was worried that the center wouldn't cook at the same time as the outside, so I shaped it into 2 long loaves in my oval crockpot, with about an inch of space in between them.  I think this worked really well. I only had 3 hours, so I cooked it on high for a bit and then turned to low to finish. Overall, my family liked it very much, and it didn't heat up our kitchen (the main reason I have been avoiding making meatloaf for several months now).  DD and DH said this was better than my regular meatloaf, and they have always loved that one.

This was a great recipe.  My family enjoyed it and it was simple and easy to make.  Since it was my first time making this, I did not change anything, and it turned out great.  I did drain the drippings before adding the remaining ketchup and used that for the gravy we had on our mashed potatoes.

I love the taste of this recipe, it's very flavorful, I couldn't get enough.  The texture was lacking though, as it fell apart, and did indeed look like dog food as one reviewer mentioned.   I used ground turkey instead of beef, so I didn't have a lot of excess drippings. I think the problem stems from the ratio of dry ingredients to moist ingredients.  Two eggs, plus the ketchup just seems excessive.  While mixing the ingredients, the meat became runny, so less moisture is a definite must.  One egg and the ketchup should work just as well, and the loaf should stick together better.  This meal will definitely stay in the rotation though, since it's so easy to throw together and cook while at my classes or at work.

This was so easy! I used 1.5 lbs hamburger and .5 lb sausage. Instead of mixing ketchup into the meatloaf, I used 1/2 cup of salsa. I only used one egg. I drained it before adding the ketchup to the top. The consistency was perfect and it stayed together perfectly!! Yummy!

An excellent, easy meatloaf.  I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs (because thats what I had) and BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (because thats what I like), and it was delicious.

We really liked this one!  I used sage flavored sausage which added some flavor.  It didn't seem to have as much grease as when you cook one in the oven and even though it sits in the drippings, the bottom wasn't all soggy.  Nothing is worse than a soggy meatloaf! :)  My husband really liked it.  Next time I will try BBQ sauce instead of ketchup to see how that tastes.

My family liked it. It was so quick and easy to make. The kids loved it over mashed potatoes. My only problem was how salty it was. Next time I will use half of the onion soup mix. This one went in our recipie box.

This was a great recipie. Instead of original sausage, I used the hot and spicy, and instead of the ketchup, I used barbeque sauce. It was eaten, leftovers and all.

Great recipie. The second time I tried I added a can of mexicorn, a touch more bread crumbs, 50/50 chuck and pizza sausage mix a dash or two of worstershire, and topped the loaf with bacon bits. (Roll up 4-5 sheets of aluminum so they are cigar shaped. Put them on bottom of crock pot to pervent sogginess at the bottom of the loaf, and will let the grease drip below the loaf. Make longer strips to make a "handle" if you please).

Okay so I totally changed this, that's why I gave it four stars...but wouldn't have come up with such a great meatloaf were it not for this recipe! Used 1lb. lean ground beef and 0.5lb. lean italian sausage=YUM! Never would have thought adding the ground sausage would work so well. Added 1/4 cup diced green pepper and 1/4 cup diced onions, one egg, 1 cup fresh bread crumbs, 1/2 cup ketchup and package of McCormick meatloaf seasoning. I have been making meatloaf for years and this came out the best consistency of any meatloaf I have ever made! It was moist but dense and did not fall apart what-so-ever! Will definitely be making meatloaf in the crock pot from now on! Cooked on low for almost 4 hours- PERFECT!! Boyfriend almost proposed marriage, it was THAT good. LOL!

Oh yeah! Had this tonight (completely unmodified).  The recipe makes enough for 2 meals for 2 grown-ups.  Honestly, it was hard to stop eating!    I was skeptical about the consistency of a slow cooker meatloaf but it was perfect.  (It's nice not to worry about overdoing it in the oven for the dreaded dried out meat brick).  I was also curious about using 1/2 sausage but it really enhanced the flavor.

Everyone has their favorite mixture of meat and seasonings for meatloaf.  I love this recipe because you can pretty much change it to your taste and still come out with a great meatloaf!  It cooked to perfection and it was ready when I got home (without heating up my house with the oven).  For those reviewers complaining about grease in the bottom - it costs a little more, but using a better grade of beef makes a HUGE difference.  I only use 96/4 and I had NO problem with excessive grease (even with 1lb of sausage).   Turned out moist but also firm - just perfect!

This was the best Meatloaf I've ever had, the whole family loved it!!!! I did follow some suggestions and added the McCormick Meatloaf Seasoning, bell peppers, only 1 egg and 1/2 C ketchup... I even drizzled a tad bit of maple syrup in the mix before cooking... YUMMY!!!

Restaurant quality! I followed the recipe as is but I used “Italian” bread crumbs & added ¼ cup of onions(I did use a tiny bit more ground beef than what it called for). My slow cooker came with a removable rack which I turned upside down & set the meat loaf on top of to keep it from soaking in the drippings. On low for 6 hours & it was perfect! It was moist but not overly so, held together nicely, melted in our mouths & was full of flavor! I’ve been trying various recipes while adjusting to married/living together life & this recipe has surely made my list to be cooked repeatedly for years to come.

Excellent!  Followed others' suggestion and put rolled up foil in bottom of cooker (a make-shift rack) so that loaf would not get soggy and it worked like a charm.  Haven't had good meatloaf (or good next day meatloaf sandwiches) since I left home.  Have tried other recipes but didn't like them.  This recipe is so simple and so very good!

This recipe is the best meatloaf recipe I've come across.  I made a couple of changes based on other reviews.  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, only one egg, and I didn't have bread crumbs so I used oatmeal.  I also made it into two smaller loaves to speed up the cooking time, and put it up on a bed of carrots and onions cut into large pieces after it was cooked through so it wouldn't sit in the juices and get too soggy.  I can't say enough about how great this recipe is.  Even my niece who is a pretty picky eater loved it!

Wonderful meatloaf! Tasted great & super easy to make. I used 2 pounds of ground beef instead of sausage & beef and it was out of this world. That is the only thing I changed. My husband even liked it AND ate leftovers! He doesn't care for meatloaf much, but he liked this one! I will be making this again & again! Thanks for submitting such a keeper!

I grew up not liking meatloaf at all. My husband, however, loved it. So I decided to give in and make some for him. This seemed simple and easy, so I decided to go from this recipe. I now love meatloaf. This is such a great recipe. My kids even love it. So full of good flavour!  I do it a tiny bit different though. I dont use sausage, but 1lb of ground beef and 2lbs ground pork. I've used both extra lean and regular meats and dont notice much difference in taste. I use a baster to "suck out" the extra fat that seems to gather in the bottom of the cooker. I also use a little less ketchup on the top of the loaf. Its a little too much for my liking! This is a go-to recipe for cheap, simple and easy dinner nights!

very flavorful!  this is one of the easiest meatloafs I have ever made.  Much less dry than when cooking in the oven.  I also only used one egg and 1/2 cup salsa in my mix.  Instead of dry onion soup mix I used an envelope of meatloaf seasoning.  Will definitely make again!

This is the best meatloaf ever! I didn't have any sausage, so I just used two pounds of ground beef. 

Make sure to taste the meatloaf before you add the top layer of ketchup.I ended up scraping it off because the meatloaf was so darn tasty that it didn't need ketchup! (The ketchup didn't enhance the overall flavor, it just covered it up.)
My kids even asked for seconds!

I love the idea of meatloaf in the slow cooker!  I made this recipe, but also added chopped bell peppers and a small onion to the meat mixture, as I would in my other meatloaf recipe.  This is very convenient and doesn't heat up the kitchen.

Did not care for.  The top split open and we found it, for some reason, very rich tasting.  I will go back to my oven meatloaf.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I didn't think so.

I made this a little different. 1lb Ground Turkey, 1/2 pound maple sausage and only one egg. I also added a packet of McCormick Meatloaf mix instead of onion soup mix. The flavor was DYNAMIC! I loved it, and I am not a huge meatloaf fan. The only problem I had was the meatloaf kind of fell apart on me. I put it in the over on 375 for 20 minutes to firm it up. I will definitely make again.

I love meatloaf, but living in Florida in the summer is not a time I want to put the oven on.  So when I came across this recipe thought I would give it a try.  It was so easy to make and tasted pretty good.  I only used ground chuck and added chopped onion and green pepper to the mix.  I will be making this again.

Pretty good.  I just used lean beef, only half the onion soup mix, and added chopped onions.  I will make it again.  Very quick, easy assembly.

Was looking to see how long to cook a meatloaf in a crock pot, this was very helpful,  I just made the best meatloaf I had ever tasted, but did it in the oven.  It was a take on a Paula Deen recipe.  I changed it up of course.

Very disappointing meatloaf. With all the great reviews, I expected good results. Cooking in the slowcooker did indeed make it very moist with a nice texture. However, the taste was a bit lacking and bland. My young children ate it only because it had ketchup on top. Will definitely make meatloaf in the slowcooker in the future, but not with this recipe.

Tasty but a little soggy because of the slow cooker. A good alternative to the oven if you don't want to watch it.

I made some small adjustments, used 2 lbs beef and 1 lb sausage, substituted salsa for ketchup, and used cheese crackers instead of bread crumbs - everyone loved it.

Oh My, my 13 year old son's favorite meal, but I never want to heat the house up with the oven, in the summer, so I tried this. It was great! the only difference was I wrapped it in foil and set it on a small loaf pan in the slower cooker, and punched 2 holes at each end so the grease and such could drain. It would have gotten 5 stars if there were a way to make it crispy on the top.

Ok, soooo I didn't have sausage or bread crumbs and I'm not a huge meatloaf fan anyways. I wound up using plain ground beef only and, believe it or not, shake-n-bake original pork crumbs. I thought for sure it was going to be like every other meatloaf we've tried- bland at best but, LO AND BEHOLD, it turned out great! My wee ones were even asking for seconds, and I had seconds as well. This is also great the next day for sandwiches! I don't know that I'll ever follow the recipe as written, but I'm making this for the second time tonight with my modifications. Thanks for sharing a great base recipe!

I have to give it a 5 star because I didn't follow the recipe...I used what I had on hand. Used 2 lbs ground beef and only one egg (everything else was the as the recipe listed. I put carrots on the bottom of the slow cooker and it cooked nicely keeping the meat out of the grease. I intend to try it with sausage, but I also think it needs onions and more than just ketchup for the topping. The way I made it, it was a bit dry. Easy, quick recipe to put together and nice after a day at work.

My mother cooked meatloaf all the time when I was a child so I was pretty burned out on it.  When my husband and I married he wanted meatloaf and of course I didn't.  After attempts at other recipes THIS is the one I plan to stick with.  IT IS AWESOME!!!

i make this meatloaf following the recpie to the t. it came out terrific!!! the only thing i recomend is using a slow cooker liner it is very easy clean up and the best part of all is you take the entire bag out cut it down either side and transfer to a serving plate. so so so easy! the one thing i did do wrong is i cooked the meatloaf for the first 2 hours on high and relized what i did then turned the slow cooker down to low and let it cook another 2 hours. all in all this recipe was AWSOME!

This was the best meatloaf recipe ever.  My kids gobbled it up.  My "hate meatloaf" husband loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I did not have ketchup in the house so I used BBQ sauce.  Spectacular.  Thanks for sharing.

I didnt care for this. It was too salty and fell apart the first time so the second time I used 2lbs ground beef(left out the sausage), 1/2 of the onion mix, 1 egg. kept the rest the same although I did add finely chopped onions and green peppers. It was like grandma made it. yum~

Very yummy!  Doubled the ground beef because I didn't have any sausage.  Also added bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  Will try with ketchup next time.

I tried this recipe and eager to do meatloaf in the crockpot. It came out moist and tasty! I was so happy to do this, very easy and tasty.
Did I say tasty? I did as it said and the sausage gives meat moisture and flavor also used ground turkey so it was great. My hubby loved it too and will save and print this for years to come.

I've made my husband a dozen meatloaf recipes over the years, and this is his favorite.  Extra points for being easy.  I was skeptical about how it would turn out in the crock pot, but it was moist, and evenly cooked.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef, simply because it was what I had on hand.

What a fabulous idea, but not sure how to keep the drippings to a minimum. I used 2 # of 93% lean hamburger meat. I wil have to see if there is a leaner % and try it next time. I did switch up the seasonings. I used more of a southwestern flare: cumin, garlic, onion, corriander, paprika, and pepper along with a Goya seasoning packet. I didn't add salt as I thought there would be enough salt with the Goya, but it still needed more salt. I also used fresh chopped cilantro, red/orange/yellow bell pepper, onion, and garlic. In place of the ketchup I used mild salsa and some dashes of worchesire sauce and tobasco sauce. If you wanted to spice it up, you could add diced hot peppers of your choice. I couldn't find my bread crumbs, so I used French's fried onion in place of them. It is delicious. Would love to pair it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Cut back on the sausage, it can get greasy. I used a 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger and 1/2 lb of sausage.

I took some advice from reviews before me. I used 2 lbs of ground beef (no sausage). Substituted ketchup for Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ Sauce. I also only had 3 hours after mixing ingredients, I formed two loaves on either side of my oval cooker with about an inch of space in between. Cook on high setting for 1hr and 30 min, turn to low for another 30 minutes. Add spices to taste. It was wonderful! Will for sure be making this again. The meat was tender and tasted wodnerful from cooking in the BBQ sauce.

I just served this for dinner tonight and my husband thought it was the best meatloaf he had ever had. I used 3% fat ground beef and lowfat Jimmy Dean sausage. I mixed all of the ketchup in the meat and used a package of onion mushroom soup,since that was what I had. Sure did  make a big batch of meatloaf, we will get a few more meals out of this one, but we enjokyed it the first time so not a problem for us.

Sadly, though I followed the directions exactly, it was dry and dense. Perhaps it was due to my crockpot - maybe it cooks faster than "usual" but I won't try this recipe again. Not worth it.

This was really salty.  Am asuming it was from the Onion soup mix as only add 1/2 of the sausage asked for.  Think I'll stick with my old favorite.  Family agreed.

We live in Phoenix, it is too hot to bake a meatloaf in the summer time.  I was really craving meatloaf.  This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I plan to take this to my next pot luck.

This was good.  Good slow cooker recipes are key with working parents.  We ate this for dinner tonight.  I made a couple of additions.  I made it the night before to be ready for the next day.  I used sage sausage, half bread crumbs and half crushed butter crackers(I wanted to use them up)  I also used bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  I also added a dash of liquid smoke, I know it sounds crazy but it turned out great.  Had my husband come home on lunch and turn it on low.  I got home about six hours later and put the bbq sauce on top for few minutes.  My 3 year old loved it.

I have to say I love my slow cooker but was a little leery of making meatloaf in it.  But what the heck I tried it and we loved it.  I did drain the grease then mixed the 1/2 cup of ketchup with a little brown sugar then added to top.  It's not something I'll make all the time since the soup mix makes it high in sodium and hubby has to now watch his sodium intake.  But he can have it for a treat once and a while.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was very easy and especially good.  It was cleaned up first night.  I didn't have any sausage, so just doubled the ground beef and the entire family enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe for someone who HATES cooking meatloaf in the oven. I use the aluminum foil in cigar shapes trick on the bottom of my slow cooker because I don't like the meat sitting in all that grease. I also use lean ground beef alone with no sausage.. again the grease. All in all this is great, very tasty and super easy to make.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and made no alterations and it turned out AMAZING. My meatloaf did not fall apart. It looked like meatloaf. That you would get in a restaurant. And tasted like it too. This recipe will for now on be my go to meatloaf recipe. 
And to all those reluctant to make this, do not trust the negative reviews, make it exactly as the recipe states and you will love it!

I cooked this recipe the other day and I was surprised that I've done so well. I changed the ketchup to 3/4 cup and added some brown sugar and some spicy mustard. This with mashed potatoes was a hit with me. Even the day after and the second day it had moisture. GREAT RECIPE YA"LL

This is the best meat loaf I've ever made.  My picky kids loved it.  It's moist, but not greasy or soggy.  I used all 93% lean beef because I didn't have sausage.  I used 1 egg as recommended by other reviewers.  I also placed pieces of cigar shaped aluminum foil at the bottom of my crock pot as another reviewer suggested.  This works great because it keeps the meat loaf up out of the grease.  I love the ease of this recipe.  It's takes 5 minutes to get it ready to throw in the crock pot.  I will make this on a regular basis.

The first time I made this I didn't have any ketchup so I substituted Hunt's Four Cheese Spaghetti Sauce and it was so good my husband talked about it for days. This time around, I used ketchup and while it was still good, it didn't even come close. Definitely using the spaghetti sauce here on out.

Amazing stuff. I bought a traditional meatloaf mix (ground beef, pork, and veal) from my local butcher and asked him to add in the sausage. The sausage adds a wonder flavor and doesn't overwhelm the whole dish. I think this is the first meatloaf I've made that was edible!

Just to suit my own tastebud I substituted 1 lb mild italian sausage and we thought it was great! I softened the bread crumbs (Kelloggs Croutettes) with 1/2 cup of milk. I used minced onion SIMPLY because of the high salt content in the soup. OK - I tweaked it a bit but - it was Excellent and suited our needs and opposite schedules.

I dont have access to Bob Evans products so I used regular sausage and I did not care for this at all, my dog loved it since he got most of it.  I also use ground turkey because thats what I use in all dishes that call for hamburger, that may have worked against this meatloaf even though I have made many different meatloafs using ground turkey and they turn out really good.

This is the best meatloaf I've had. My husband and I both love it so I make it pretty often.  Very easty to make and having it cook in the slow cooker over night or while I'm at work is great.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a different brand of sausage since Bob Evans brand isn't sold in my area.

Made as directed except used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (like it better is all) and this turned out pretty good, especially for a slow cooker.  I overcooked it a bit, simply left it on too long and one end was a way overcooked.  However, it was easy to slice that little section right off and the rest was great!  Oh I only used one egg also.  Might add just a tiny bit more breadcrumbs or crackers next time.

Pretty darned good! The sausage makes it a bit oily, but that tends to make it really moist too! Will definitely make it again!

The texture of this meatloaf was GREAT!! I made it on my lunch hour and it was perfect when i got home from work 5 1/2 hours later. I missread the recipe and added all of the ketchup so just added more bread crumbs.  The whole family loved it and I will DEFINATLY make this again!

I love the convenience of slow cookers and I've always loved meatloaf.  I guess I'm more of a meatloaf purist or something because I just didn't care for the taste with the sausage in it.  And it was VERY greasy.  If it had cheese in it, it would have tasted like the Bob Evans sausage balls.

This was soooo good!  I make Meatloaf A LOT and my family loves it but I usually do it in the oven so when I saw this recipe I decided what the hay and tried it out.  My husband flipped out when he came home and saw the meatloaf that he loves in the crockpot because he was sure that I was ruining it.  This was the moistest, most flavorful meatloaf I have ever made.  There was nothing left for leftovers like there usually is.  Awesome!!

The flavor was awesome in this meatloaf and it cooked in the exact amount of time specified. I followed the recipe exactly and found though that it fell apart more than I had hoped. It just crumbled, but was still delicious. We will definetly make again. Thanks

Very good and flavorful.  I changed it up a bit, basically halved it.  1 lb ground lamb, the entire envelope of italian herb soup mix, 1/2 cup curry ketchup, 1/2 cup italian breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup finely chopped onions.  Its a new family favorite and my husband and son are picky eaters.

My husband, kids and I did not care for this meatloaf at all. We all like sausage and thought it would add a spicy kick to the meatloaf, however it ended up overpowering every other flavor and tasted like a big "sausageloaf" to us. None of us could get past a couple bites. However, not wanting the waste the entire meatloaf that none of us would eat, we gave it my husband's father, who loved it and even ate it cold on sandwiches. So I guess it's good if sausage-loaf sounds good to you.

A quick and easy recipe, but we found it a little bland.  I will probably try it again with a few more spices and/or hot sauce to jazz it up a bit.

I've been making this for a few years now. I've made it per the directions in the slow cooker a couple times. A year or so I decided to try making it in the oven in a bread pan (9x5). I bake it at 375 for 50-60 mins and let it rest for about 10 mins before serving it. It turned out great. Sometimes I don't add the topping. It is salty but just make sure to have a light side dish with it and plenty of water. I love using the leftovers in my next morning omelets or on a sandwich for lunch.

This is my go to meatloaf recipe. I do change 2 things though...I use all ground beef (we are not fans of pork), and instead of ketchup, I use Maul's BBQ sauce! It's to die for, sooo good, and hubby loves it. Give the BBQ sauce a try if it sounds up your alley. It really compliments the onion soup flavoring and makes it a little different than your average meatloaf. Yummy!

Came out great, just like any of the best meatloaves we have made.  The slow cooker just added the ability to let it cook while we were at church and be ready for us when we got home.  This is a great recipe I will use again.

We loved this meatloaf! I didn't add the sausage but I did everything else the same with ground round beef :) I thought it was moist and delicious! We dumped the grease off in the sink and then made some instant mashed potatoes and spread them on top of the meatloaf and let it cook for 30 more minutes. So good, will make again!

No one can believe that this really tastes good, but it does.  4 stars instead of 5 because a little too salty for my taste and it would be much better with a tangy, sticky glaze rather than cold ketchup on top. None of us were fans of that part.

I have been searching for the perfect meatloaf recipe for years and have been continually disappointed. This one is THE ONE. The fact that it cooks in the crockpot just makes it that much better. Thank you!

I was really skeptical about meatloaf in the crock pot, but this was great!.  It turned out much more moist and evenly cooked than when I cook meatloaf in the oven.  The whole family went back for seconds.  

I put the meatloaf directly on the bottom of the slow cooker, and after reading some of the reviews, drained the drippings out of the bottom after 4 hours.  I used 2 pounds of 90% lean ground beef, and barbecue sauce instead of ketchup (simply because that was what I had on hand).  Turned out great.  

Also... I have one of the newer crock pots (that in my opinion cook WAY too hot).  After 4 hours, I checked the meatloaf temp.  It was over 165, so I turned it from low to warm until I was ready to serve.

We used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef and left out the ketchup and it was delicious!  Very little fat and very rich.   I also tried it with the "meatloaf in a mug" technique and it was DELICIOUS! It was the perfect size for slicing for a sandwich. Just added ketchup to the sandwich and hubby said it was perfect and kept him filled up all afternoon. (Which is rare!):) *** WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN! :)***

This was pretty good. I ended up just taking out the little foil balls as they didn't do to much good anyways.

I personally am not a huge meatloaf lover anyway but my boyfriend is. I thought it was pretty good and my boyfriend said it was just as good as an oven cooked meatloaf. I was extremly easy to make. That's always a plus being a mother and working fulltime.

I did not like this at all.  I did not use the sausage & I put some carrots and potatoes in the crockpot with the meatloaf to have a complete meal ready...maybe that effected the taste.  I don't really know but i could not eat it.  I had read about it in another recipe so I thought why not?

This was "OK". I had high expectations, but was very disappointed with the end result. I really enjoy the taste of sausage and thought this would be outstanding since it was one of the main ingredients. What I ended up with was a dry, dense meatloaf. I followed the directions to a T except for using a quarter pound less sausage (all I had) and increasing the beef by a quarter pound to compensate. I also added aobut 1/4 cup of chopped green bell pepper and could have still used more. Despite other's warning of the meatloaf mixture being "too wet", I proceeded as instructed with no problems, shaped into an oblong loaf and placed in my slow cooker. I should have used the probe setting, but decided to use the program setting (5 hours on low) instead. I was in a hurry to leave for a Superbowl get-together, so I checked the internal temperature after 4 hours and, to my surprise, the meatloaf had already reached 185 degrees (which is probably why it was very dry). I hadn't brushed the meatloaf with katsup yet, so I did  and turned the sc to the warm setting. On Monday evening, my bf and I warmed up slices with a side of mashed potatoes and green peas. I don't know if this would have tasted better right out of the crock or not, but will not be giving this another try to find out. I enjoy most of Bob Evan's recipes, but not this one. Thanks anyways!

I don't have what I think of as a good meatloaf recipe.  I was hoping this would be the one, but, I was disappointed with the taste.  Even tried it the next day... no better.  However, it couldn't be easier to cook and produced a meatloaf with, what I consider, a perfect texture.  I am impressed with the methodology and will use it again, but, with different ingredients.

Good comfort food and easy to make.  I've never had a problem with the loaf falling apart, but I only use one egg.  I like a bit of Worcestshire mixed in the ketchup, and I like to coat the sides of the loaf, too.  Usually I omit the sausage because I have a small family and because sausage is expensive & unhealthy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I never knew one could make meatloaf in a slow cooker!  That itself deserves some recognition.  Beyond that, I didn't like the taste or density of this meatloaf.  I might try the recipe again someday and replace the bread crumbs with crumbled up bread slices.
