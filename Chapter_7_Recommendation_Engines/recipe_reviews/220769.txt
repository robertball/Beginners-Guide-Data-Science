I made this for Easter. It was easy and came out so cute! I gave him green onion whiskers and craisen eyes--the kids loved it. After using bunny as a dip with veggies, we used the remainder bread to go with dinner. Delious!

I made this for my son's preschool Easter party.  They loved it!  I used whole wheat bread dough.  I'm told the kids sat at the bunny and ripped off pieces by the handful!  Will definitely make this again!

I've picked this to make for Easter dinner today and I was worried first time ever working with frozen dough. Love it! I messed up by braiding the ears, one is perfect one not so much. Love this recipe perfectly written instructions are appreciated!!! 

THANKS! Going to be a new tradition!
