This has been my go-to recipe for a long time (it was originally posted long ago). It is delicious as it stands, but is so adaptable. I generally cut the recipe in half and make it in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan. I have added, in no particular order, minced jalapenos, a can of drained Rotel tomatoes and chilis, green peppers, red peppers, turkey sausage, hot sausage, bacon, and various cheeses (regular or low-fat), depending on what I have on hand. (Please note: I have never added these all at once; this is a list of possible additions you might have on hand. And if you're halving the recipe and are enthusiastic in your additions, use 5 eggs instead of 4.) Also, I use the packaged southwest-style hash browns in place of the plain hash browns. One suggestion: the only thing I found among the cheeses that I couldn't replace is the cottage cheese. It really is essential for creaminess. The one time I made this without, the casserole was brick-like, edible, but not nearly as good as usual. I often make this on a Sunday morning and cut the leftovers in squares and refrigerate or freeze, to be eaten during the week or later. Thank you for this delicious addition to AllRecipes.

When I need to feed a crowd this is the recipe I use.  It is delicious.  There are never any leftovers - even if I make two pans.  The guys in my office request it often.  YUM!

This is a really good hearty breakfast casserole.  Probably one of the best I've ever had.  I increased the bacon since my family loves bacon.   I drained it well for several minutes to get as much of the fat out as possible.  Other than increasing the bacon some, I didn't change anything and didn't need to. Put leftovers in the fridge and we had for breakfast the next day.  It reheats well.  Served with some warm soft freshly baked Cresent rolls.    Thanks for sharing.

This.   Was.   Delicious!   I made this for Christmas breakfast, and the family raved about it. I prepared it last night following the exact recipe, and set it in the fridge overnight. Baked at 350 for 1 hour this morning.  Would make sure the hash browns are fully thawed and DRY before placing in the mix (otherwise could be sloppy or ruined by too much moisture).  Also, did have to use paper towels to absorb grease from the top of the dish.  Afterward  this dish was not greasy looking or tasting.  I will make this again and again!

This is really good! For potatoes, I cut red potatoes w/ skin on into small cubes and sauteed til just slightly fork tender, in a small amount of some reserved bacon fat but w/ lid on pan to steam them so I didn't have to use too much grease to cook them.  (I make 1 1/2 times recipe so had 6 cups of cube potatoes) Precooked  the potatoes, cooked the bacon and onion the day before and then just added the eggs and cheese the day I made it.  I also used 2 -10 oz frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and water squeezed out thru colander, then added to the egg mixture.   1 1/2 X the recipe w/ fresh cut potatoes and spinach as above filled an 11 X 14 casserole dish and served 16.  350 X 1 hr or so.

My favorite.  So delicious and easy!  I love that there's no bread in it.  Not a swiss cheese fan, but it's delicious in this! YUMMY!

So here's the deal:  Mrs. Montana Elk Guy says this is THE best thing I've ever made.  Enough said.  I followed the recipe exactly, with one minor modification:  I browned and crisped the hash browned potatoes (shredded 'em myself, using non-peeled, Yukon Gold spuds) first, and placed them in the bottom of my baking dish.  All other ingredients then went on top of the hash browned potato base.  My two sons INHALED this, as well.  In our household, this will become a recipe used for "special" breakfasts - you know, Christmas morning, Easter Sunday, etc.  Many thanks for a true 5-star recipe!

I've made this several times and it is always a hit. I use turkey sausage and have even made a smaller batch without hash browns. Delicious every time! I prefer to brown the hash browns first and get them crispy. Instead of mixing them in, I press them in the bottom of the pan and pour the egg/cheese/sausage mixture over the top. Yummy!

I made this for a breakfast potluck at work.  It was really easy to make and everyone loved it!  I did use the cubed potato hash browns with peppers and onions.  This added a nice flavor to the dish.  I also put it together the night before and baked it for 60 min in the morning.  Will be making this again!

Gluten-free! My husband was recently diagnosed with celiac disease, so I've had to change a lot of my regular recipes. When we needed to provide a breakfast casserole for a church brunch, I decided to give this recipe a try, so that my husband would have a dish he knew would be safe to eat. It was delicious! In fact, this is one gluten-free recipe that holds its own against other recipes that call for condensed soups, breads, etc. It was a good thing my husband got his helping right away, because the pan was soon empty, so others must have agreed. Thanks for sharing!

Don't know what happened to my comment but it disappeared. This is a special breakfast for special occasions.  I love it.  I have a questions.  Can this be frozen and reheated in the oven?  I am going away for a few days and don't want to cook.  Does anyone know?  I am concerned about the potatoes.  thanks!

Made this for our church's Easter Breakfast.  I thawed the hash browns, browned the bacon and chopped the onions the night before and stored them in the fridge.  I put the rest together the next morning and I baked it closer to one hour.  It went over very well and my family wished for left overs.  There weren't any.  Thanks for the recipe parothstein!

My daughter had this when we were over at their house last christmas. On birthdays at our house you get to choose what you want for your birthday. My husband chose this. I am not crazy about breakfast casseroles, but this one is the best I have ever had.

I've been looking for a breakfast casserole to make for awhile and finally tried this one for a Valentines breakfast for hubby and kids.  My first egg casserole and it was a huge success. I threw in some diced pre-cooked sausage in addition to the bacon and I used 11 eggs.  It was seriously good, especially with a couple shakes of hot sauce on top! I am always trying new recipes from this site, never disappointed. My family is always wondering what they'll eat next. Fun!  Oh yeah, this does seem to call for a bread side such as biscuits.  Enjoy this one!

God bless the Amish.  They know how to make delicious foods from basic ingredients.  I've substituted lots of meats for the bacon but bacon is still the gold standard.  Also, you MUST add the cottage cheese.  It's what makes this breakfast casserole so unique.  How nice to know that this is gluten-free.  I do add freshly ground black pepper to mine.I know I'll be serving it for my Christmas morning brunch.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great casserole dish for breakfast or brunch.  I think it definitely needs 12 eggs, especially if you are using large eggs and not the extra large eggs.  Might even be better with 14.  Serves 14 easily and would be good for large family gatherings.  I did not want the casserole to be too greasy so substituted 1 cup of chopped fresh green onions instead of frying one onion with the bacon.  The fresh green color also added to the appearance.  Bacon was good with it and will try sage sausage next time.  I also added garlic salt to bring up the flavor.

I have made this casserole for the past 4 Christmas mornings. Everyone loves it! The only change I made was to put chunks of ham in from XMAS eve dinner. DOnt care for breakfast casseroles that have bread in them. This is just perfect to feed a large crowd!

I have made this recipe with bacon, sausage and ham.  They all have turned out wonderful.
I would recommend to let the hash browns sit out and completly thaw so you wont get any water in your casserole.
I always make this and take to work, my cowokers appreciate this so much and making it the night before is a big help.

This has been our go-to breakfast casserole since we found it. It has also become our Christmas morning breakfast too. We use sausage instead of bacon...not sure why. I think we must have had sausage on hand the first time we made it and just stuck with that 'cuz it's SO GOOD! :)

Delicious!  Even my granddaughter, who doesn't like eggs, loved this!  Easy to make.  I used Potatoes O'Brien (with green and red peppers) and it was a very pretty and tasty casserole.  Great for brunch and family gatherings - everyone had seconds.    --Marti

I first made this for a Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  I then used it to feed over 100 people at a woman's breakfast at church that I hosted.  Everyone just raved over it.  I am planning on making it for this Christmas again and I got strict orders from my mother to save her a piece.  This also reheats really good.  I will be making 2 pans this time.

I made this recipe as it's written with just 2 exceptions.  I didn't have swiss cheese on hand, so I used colby.  I didn't have an onion on hand, so I used dried onion.  I wouldn't recommend making that substitution.  The casserole tasted very good, but seemed like it was missing something (my guess is the onion).  I'll definitely be making this again...next time with the onion!

Made it for our Christmas gathering with my son and his family and it was loved by all! Even their kids :) 

I did modify to incorporate several comments from others - increased the amount of bacon; cooking and seasoning the onions for 10 minutes prior to adding the bacon. I cooled onions/bacon on paper towels before adding to other ingredients. I like spicy food so used pepper jack cheese rather than the Swiss. I also used obrien potatoes for the extra flavor. I added Italian seasoning and black pepper to the eggs as well before adding to the mix. We had an amazing casserole after 50 minutes in the oven...hard to get them to wait the ten minutes to cut into it!

Definitely will make this again! So will my kids ~

It turned out wonderful, my first breakfast casserole that has turned out. I substituted cocktail sausage for bacon, its what I had on hand. And I only had two cups of shredded cheese total, still came out wonderful. I baked it with foil for half the time then took it off I didn't want it to get too brown. Will make again for sure.

I was a bit skeptical to try this recipe because of the cottage cheese. But I used it anyway, and like other reviewers noted, you couldn't taste it. I also used the diced potatoes with onion and green pepper and used 12 eggs.  I received several compliments. However, next time I'll add salt and pepper and use sharp cheddar and maybe mozzarella cheeses instead. It needed just a little more flavor for my taste. It was easy to prepare.

Incredible! I'm not usually a big fan of Swiss cheese but as another reviewer mentioned, it is quite good in this. I followed the recipe exactly other than tossing in two diced white mushrooms I had on hand and needed to use up. Next time I may add in maybe half a pound of ham or Canadian bacon to boost up it's meatiness some since my family is very carnivorous. Despite that, this recipe truly deserves five stars as is. I have a feeling this will become a regular part in our house's breakfast rotation.

This recipe is very good. The next time I make it I will brown the bacon and onions separately due to the onions getting too brown before the bacon was ready.  I pressed the thawed potatoes into the bottom of a buttered casserole dish and added salt, pepper and garlic powder then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I served this for Easter brunch and everyone loved it.  I was asked twice for the recipe. I will be making this one again and again.  I would be good for dinner too. Like others I assembled mine the days before and baked the next day.

Mine looked nothing like the picture so maybe something went wrong. It was just a mushy, greasy mess. Not good at all.

I made this for breakfast yesterday (Christmas) morning. Was going to make it the night before and just bake it on Christmas, but then I thought sitting all night might mess with the dynamic of the recipe since it calls for frozen potatoes.
So, the night before, I grated my cheese, chopped my onion and fried the onion and bacon. Then all I had to do was assemble and bake on Christmas and wasn't stuck in the kitchen all morning.
It was very good, but did need to bake an extra 15-20 minutes to allow the eggs to set. Also, it doesn't call for salt and I thought that may because of the cheese and bacon both having lots of salt to lend, but with so many potatoes, it does need at least 1tsp of salt added. You could also add mushrooms or peppers or sausage, etc. before baking for extra flavor. It was slightly bland and monotone in flavor, but still tasty. My daughter added ketchup to hers, on her plate. My husband said it had a lot of potatoes and could use more flavor (add ins). My son loved it the way it was! I will make this again. Very handy for breakfast get together or holiday.

this was a very good casserole and the flavor is great! I added just a dash of garlic powder, salt and pepper, personal preference. It would have been good without it as written. I'm not a swiss cheese fan but it's really good in here.

Made this recipe for Easter brunch.  It was good but it needed salt and pepper, and perhaps some paprika to give it some flavor. It was quite bland.

Very good! I've been wanting to make this for quite some time. I particularly liked the fact that it calls for cottage cheese, instead of milk. I personally think milk makes the eggs in breakfast casseroles tasteless and watery. I found this recipe on the Taste of Home website too, and that recipe calls for six eggs. With that in mind, and this recipe, I compromised and used 7 eggs. I also used smoked gouda cheese instead of Swiss, because I couldn't find a block of Swiss at the two stores I went to. I used O'Brien shredded hash B's and sautéed some mushrooms to add in. Very flavorful casserole, even the next day! Probably the best I've ever had.  Will definitely make again and again! I and my hubby thank you for sharing!

I made this for a group of 9 guys staying at our house for a church retreat. I made it yesterday and only had to pop it in the oven. It was all gone!! ( I made two other types of casseroles as well). I used half an onion since it was for breakfast and 8 eggs. I had never bought frozen hash browns before, but opted to brown them before adding to the mix as one person suggested. This recipe is  a keeper and will probably one of our future Christmas morning breakfast dishes because of how easy and delicious it was.

I have made this for every brunch in the last five years and everyone loves it - never any left overs. I follow the recipe but have also used cheddar cheese on occasions depending what I have on hand. Like others, I prepare this egg dish the night before when I make my baked French toast (also from this site).  I prepare as much as possible the night before so my kitchens is clean and all I have to do is put it in the oven and it is hot when everyone arrives.

Super simple and tasty. Followed the recipe as written, but added an extra egg as the mixture looked a bit dense (my eggs may have been on the small side). To save a bowl to wash, I let the bacon & onion cool a bit, and just added the remaining ingredients to the original pan before pouring into the casserole.

The first time i made this I felt that 4 cups of hash browns made it a little too dense for my liking.
Made again over the weekend.  Used only 3 cups of hash browns, left out the bacon and made it a veggie one.  Used diced green, red and yellow peppers and a small can of mushrooms.  Added salsa when served.  Yumm!

I loved it!  I've made it 4 times now. Once with bacon, once with ham cubes, and twice with sausage. For me and my family, the sausage was by far the best. I also added mushrooms and red and green peppers for more flavor as well as color. Awesome stuff!

Although I altered the recipe just a smidge, I have no doubt the bacon version would be amazing.  This was the biggest hit at a Mother's Day brunch with the family.

I used 1lb. of sage sausage in lieu of bacon (I do love bacon, but when it comes to breakfast, I'm a sausage gal), 11 eggs, 1 whole sweet onion, 4/5 of a 16 oz. 2% cottage cheese, 2 cups of mild cheddar, all but one slice of a package of Swiss (I consumed 1 slice for my effort) and almost an entire bag of potatoes o'brien (with the peppers already in the frozen mixture.)

I sautéed the onion and sausage together for about 15 minutes (med/high) while simultaneously cooking the potatoes in another skillet (it does help keep them from turning to mush).  I used a stick of salted butter to coat the bottom and sides of my casserole dish, and, rather than mixing the potatoes in with all ingredients, I spread them evenly on the bottom of a 9 x 13 casserole dish.  After cooking and draining the sausage and onions, I pretty much followed the recipe. 

I mixed the eggs, cheeses, and sausage in a large bowl added ground pepper and a touch of salt (the recipes has enough sodium for flavor already), and then placed the mixture on top of the potatoes.  

Because I used more eggs than the recipes calls for, I cooked this for approximately 60 min at the recommended 350 degrees.  VOILA!

This was even delicious cold straight from the fridge.  The recipe is easy and sure to win over any crowd!!  I do recommend using high quality in

I made this for a work breakfast.  I'll admit I was a little leery with the addition of cottage cheese, but decided to make it as we have several people with gluten allergies and this was one of the few breakfast casserole recipes without bread/flour.   I cooked the bacon the night before and mixed everything together in the morning. I had also decided not to add the onions (there were quite a few people I knew didn't like onions). I mistakenly bought cottage cheese with chives so decided to add it anyways and it was a nice complement without a strong onion flavor.  Every one enjoyed it and even asked for the recipe.  It was so simple to make. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  What a great recipe .... a definitely GO TO for a meal for Breakfast or a Lunch (for company) or Dinner for the home-folk!!!  I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee ... cooked my bacon in the George Forman.  Added a little half and half, used half Ricotta and half cottage cheese mixed with an electric mixer.  Honestly, at first, I did not like the texture but soon realized it was less fat (by far) than using the same ingredients with canned condense soup.  All I can san is "thank you".

I used hot Jimmy Dean sausage instead of bacon. Made it on Christmas morning and it was a huge hit with my family. I noted the previous posts about using 11 eggs and think it fluffed up nicely. Served it with biscuits and sausage gravy for a yummy meal. Definitely will make it again.

Wonderful breakfast casserole!  I made it for a party and 3 of my relatives hate cottage cheese.  I made another casserole for this reason but told no one about the cottage cheese.  They all ate it and raved and no one knew cottage cheese was even in it!  I made one change and that was shredding and using raw potatoes instead of frozen hash browns.  I cooked them in with the sauted items, and they came out perfect.  I will definitely use this again!

I have made it the original way and loved it, but I always like to try something different so I also decided to try turkey bacon. I really like it this way because it had the taste without the greasy part. I also omitted the onions, only because I thought it was rich enough without it. You can do so many different things with this recipe and still have a hit!

This is very easy and quick to make. I used O'Brien  hash brown potatoes and reduced the onion by half.  I made it the night before and baked it the next morning without any problem. Everyone loved it!

An update on my previous review:  I have made this casserole many times and have added chopped spinach to the eggs and some red pepper flakes. Gives it a bit of color and a little zip. We love this recipe!  Made very slight changes. First, i cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us.  Secondly, I used turkey sausage instead of bacon. Thirdly, I added 3/4 teaspoon of dry mustard to the eggs before adding to the hash browns and sausage.  I covered it for part of the baking time and baked it for an hour and ten minutes.  I have always made a breakfast casserole for Christmas morning and this is the best I have made. I really like that it doesn't have bread and includes hash browns. In the past I made a separate hash brown casserole.  This made it so much easier.  Thank you parothstein for sharing!

I am not a huge fan of breakfast casseroles, but this one is amazing! It is our new Christmas morning tradition. Not too eggy and is so delicious. We don't like onions, so I substituted red & green peppers and it was so good. The peppers really add a nice flavor and color to the casserole. I also used cubed potatoes/hashbrowns instead of shredded and they were great. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS RECIPE!

My guests and family loved this recipe.  I did use 12 eggs instead of 9 and will do that in the future as well.  Delicious!

I scaled down the ingredients since I only had 3 eggs. I poured everything into a greased 8" square baking dish and baked as directed until the eggs looked firm, ~ 30 minutes. The internal temperature was 180F, well above the safe temperature for egg casseroles. I let the casserole cool for about 5 minutes before serving. The texture was moist yet firm. Very tasty for not having to add additional salt or pepper!

It was good as written. I saw everyone adding salt and pepper once I served it to my guests.  Maybe using sharp cheddar instead of mild would be better?

Very easy and very good.  I used Bob Evans breakfast sausage in place of bacon and also made a vegetarian one without any meat. When I saw hash brown potatoes I bought shredded instead of diced. It worked very well. The cottage cheese makes it very creamy.

Great adaptable recipe. I halved it keeping the same amounts of bacon and shredded cheese. I saved one cup of the shredded cheese to put on the top. This time I added sautéed mushrooms, onion and zucchini. I also used just a little hot sauce in the egg mixture, along with a sprinkle of garlic powder, parsley and dill.  I've made this with and without the cottage cheese.....definitely use it. For presentation and finish sprinkle just a little grated Pecorino Romano on top. Great with sweet sausage too.

I was assigned to bring an egg dish to a breakfast meeting. Instead of making a quiche, I came upon this recipe since it had high ratings. I took a lot of tips from other cooks by making a hash brown crust and using 12 eggs. I tested this recipe the night before and cooked it for Sunday breakfast. I switched up the Swiss cheese for Colby and add red bell pepper. I used diced hot linked sausage instead of bacon. I cooked all the veggies and potatos prior mixing it into the egg/cheese mixture. It looks beautiful but the it tasted bland. Second round, I used 1 pound hot Italian sausage, 1/2 of chopped sweet onion, 2 cups of diced potatoes, 2 cups hash browns, 12 eggs, 2 cups mild cheddar, 2 cups Colby Jack, 1 1/2 cups cottage cheese, 1/2 cup diced red pepper, 1 cup chopped broccoli flowerets, salt, and black pepper. Cooked as indicated. I was nervous on serving this to work  but they loved it! The hot Italian sausage made a huge difference and gave it flavor.  It's an expensive dish to make and will make it again with the alterations only for special occassions.

I made this last night for a group of 5 adults and 1 toddler, and everyone loved it! Even with a couple of people having seconds (and thirds!) there was still some leftover. Definitely best for a big crowd or a potluck. I didn't change much except I used turkey bacon, and I didn't have any Swiss so I just used all cheddar. It was so delicious!

This is the BEST breakfast casserole I've ever eaten! I was a little nervous about the cottage and swiss cheeses in the recipe because my kids do not like either one, so I just didn't tell anyone it was in there and no one ever knew. My kids loved it! It's very filling too. Mine didn't look like the picture either. The picture looks stirred. I made this in a 9x11 pan and it came out browned on top. Be sure to let it sit for at least the recommended 10 minutes before you cut it.

I didn't have hash browns so I used frozen Potatoes O'Brien, thawed, and omitted the onions.  I also added two extra eggs.  We had several people, a few of whom don't like cottage cheese and/or Swiss cheese, but everyone raved about this dish and went back for seconds.

This is our annual Christmas morning breakfast. I make it on Christmas eve, have it all ready and pop it in the oven while kids open presents. Last year I tried switching it up and my family was not impressed. I do always end up using about twice the amount of eggs though, to hold everything together. I strongly recommend this recipe. Delicious and easy.

I used cubed ham instead of bacon, and it turned out great. The only thing that I would change is that it needs seasoning. It was a little bland, so I would add salt and pepper to it next time.

I like to make a breakfast casserole on the weekend and the husband and son will eat on it most of the week. When I ask which one they want, they always suggest this one. A lot of times I will add more egg I find that helps it to not be so heavy. Also at times I will use country style gravy mix just to give a little flavor.

My family loves this breakfast casserole!  I make two substitutions due to our love of all things spicy.  I use sausage instead of bacon and pepper jack cheese instead of swiss cheese.  I also sometimes add chopped, pickled jalapeno pepper slices.  Like I said, we love some spice!

Excellent!  Other than adding more bacon, I followed the recipe.  If you have time, it's always better to use a block of cheese and and shred it yourself.  Preshredded cheese has lots of extras in it (potato starch, cellulose) to stop it from clumping in the bag.  This causes inconsistent results in any dish and sometimes a less attractive taste and look.

This got high praise at a big family breakfast.  I usually don't change recipes and then comment, but I will this time.  Another person was bringing a big batch of bacon so I changed the bacon for sausage, and I changed up the cheese blend with what I had on hand.  I think as written, or with those changes won't change the 5-star rating.

I made it for a large brunch the day before but did not cook it until the day of.  When I took it out to cook there was some liquid separation so I stirred it all back together and it turned out great. Everyone really liked it.

Rave reviews from my family. I put the casserole together a day in advance and put in the fridge overnight covered with aluminum foil. Baked in the morning and family and guests loved it.  I used Butterball turkey bacon, 1% milk and added yellow bell pepper. Once it was done, covered 1/2 with cheddar and the other half with swiss cheese to melt on the top so everyone could choose which cheese they wanted.

This was an easy casserole to make and my office loved it.  I made it exactly as it was written except I added a little more bacon and cheddar cheese.  I made it the night before and just cooked it almost 1 hour the next morning.  I will certainly be making this again.

I've made this twice in the past week for two different brunches and everyone loved it.  It's a definite addition for all my future brunches.  I added an extra egg and some extra egg whites.  I used large eggs but needed a little more moisture and it turned out great.

I exchanged the cottage cheese for sour cream and added jalapenos, and this dish turned out amazing. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious!  I didn’t have cottage cheese - but used Monterey Jack, cheddar and Swiss and it was amazing!

This is a go to recipe that I have used over and over. It is in the oven right now and I added red peppers, spinach and mushrooms. It is something that you can make on a weekend and heat up all week long for breakfast or make for a special occasion. Very easy to heat up.

I wanted to make this for 7 guests plus me and my husband.
The night before:
I fried the bacon and onion, set it aside. Then fried my hash browns (I used freeze dried and reconstitute them 2/3 of the recommended water) when browned, I put them in the bottom of the casserole, added the bacon and onions and put it in the refrigerator.    In the morning:  I mixed a dozen eggs, all the cheeses and poured over the top of the casserole. and baked for an hour at 350.  This was one of easiest meals to fix for 5 adults and 4 teens,  this along with a bowl of fruit made and outstanding breakfast....now you see it, now you don't!
  Next time:  I'll add a half pound of diced baked ham, 4 chopped green onions and a half chopped red pepper for color.

This is a great recipe!  I make it when my family wants breakfast for dinner.  It also makes a great harvest meal for our farm.  We like to top it with salsa and served with tortillas.  You can change up the meats, the types of potatoes, add more cheese, just about anything!  It’s great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Thank you ever so much for sharing this wonderful meal!

This was a hit at Christmas brunch! Like many others, I made some modifications. 1) We are vegetarians, so I used no meat. 2) I used a full bag of frozen hash browns which was closer to 5 cups instead of 4 and browned them first.  3) I used 10 eggs. 4) I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. 5) I used 4 cups of assorted cheeses. 6) I sautéed some spinach with the onions. The only recommendation from my family was to add more spinach. As you can see, this recipe lends itself to modifying to your tastes! I will definitely make it again!

Let try again, made as written and knew it would be bland.  Looking to see what I can add to improve to my families taste.  Salt and pepper is a start, possibly a small amount of Franks Hot Sauce, sautéed red peppers, green onions  on top before serving.

An excellent easy delicious dish to make for company brunch. I followed the reviews and baked the hashbrowns in the oven for around 20 minutes until lightly browned.   Beware though prep time is not 10 minutes. Between chopping & browning the bacon, grading the cheese and everything else prep time is closer to 30- 45 minutes but well worth it. I did all the prep the night before and just put everything together the morning of and that took about 15 minutes.   My guests loved it.

This is great for making day ahead & baking the next morning. Great for potlucks, it doesn't dry out (like other recipes Ive tried)  if you have to reheat it or keep it warm. I've made exactly as is & I have also used different cheeses and green onions instead of yellow. I have even used spinach & mushroom with ham & potato. You can get really creative with this recipe or make as is & its tasty.

I made this according to the directions and I found it to be quite bland.  My family said it was okay, but needed something to make it tastier. I felt like it was "piecey" in texture, like nothing really blended together.  I won't make it again.

I made as written and I thought it was just okay.  There  are a lot of things I'd rather eat for that much fat and cholesterol.  That said, for those who are going to make it,  I suggest baking it in two smaller pans because the edges were overcooked while the center was still mushy.

Love it!  My new favorite breakfast casserole!  I halved the recipe, and used 5 eggs.  I added 4 oz ham and just 100 calories worth of bacon.  I omitted the onion, and sauteed bell pepper instead.   I put in the refrigerator overnight and baked it at 350 degrees for an hour in the AM.  So good!  Not like some of the dry egg recipes I've had in the past.

Meh.  Nothing too write home about.  It wasn't bad.  I always know when my hubby doesn't care for something when he asks for the hot sauce after the first bite.  I made it just like the recipe is written.  Perhaps some spices would make it better.

Was pretty good as written, however I feel it does need a little seasoning or extra veg for more flavor! I do like that this doesn't call for a can of cream of something soup.. Very good thanks!

I really liked this! I'd never used cottage cheese in a breakfast casserole, and it makes for a nice texture. It was dense enough, not too dense. It was done in 45 minutes, baked uncovered. The swiss cheese adds a nice flavor. With the bacon and cheese no extra salt is needed. I also made it again with a mexican flair, using Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss, and added 8 oz. of fresh roasted chopped green chiles and some Cholula sauce. Mmmmmm...but would use more green chiles next time for that. It's such a versatile recipe! I would use a little less potatoes and a little more eggs next time to cut some carbs for me (being borderline diabetic), but I love this.

Really good.  I took some of the suggestions here:  addded extra bacon, a dozen eggs instead of 9 for fluffiness, and browned/crisped hash browns.  I also added  red, orange/yellow peppers just to have some vegetables in it, and also a poblano pepper to add just a touch of heat - it won't give much, but just a little.  It got raves from everybody in the room, and none went home with me.  I'll definitely be making it again.  It's a different spin on breakfast casseroles.

Made this exactly as specified in the recipe.  Everyone raved about it and I will surely make it again. One caveat, fry the bacon until it is almost crisp before adding the onions. If you put them in the pan at the same time, the onions brown much quicker than the bacon and lose much of their moistness.  Also, watch your time carefully.  I baked mine in a dark metal pan and it was a bit overcooked in 45 minutes, next time I'll check it at 35 minutes and adjust accordingly.

Yummy.   It was an easy recipe.  I made it with bacon, but I think it would be good with ham or sausage.   My guests commented on how delicious it was.  Also, it was good reheated the next day.

My first attempt at recipes is to fix them as the poster posted them. This was AWESOME!  My family went crazy over it! I wouldn't change a thing, but place on the table salt, pepper and my favorite hot sauces for those that want to flavor to their liking.

Made this for Christmas brunch two years in a row.  It is so easy since I assembled the night before and let it sit in fridge overnight.  After the first time I decided to use turkey sausage and just a little bacon for flavor.  It was less greasy and still delicious.  I found I needed to cook it longer than suggested and then allowed the top and edges to get a little crispy since the inside stays soft and can be runny if not cooked fully.  Everyone went back for seconds!

I was put in charge of the teacher Christmas appreciation breakfast which I had never done before and I have tons of amish relatives so when I saw the word "amish" in the name and then saw the high reviews, I definitly wanted to make it for the breakfast. I made one with turkey bacon (what I had on hand) and one with hillshire farms cheese smokies.(fyi: the bacon one was empty way before the sausage one was) The only thing I did different was brown the hashbrowns and lay them on the bottom so they had a crunch to them. The casseroles were a hit! The principle said she wanted to hire me as her personal chef and that she could eat this casserole all day. It was SO easy. I highly recommend this breakfast casserole. PLUS, it is gluten free. I then made it a few weeks later for Christmas morning. But I put it together the night before (without browning the hashbrowns) and in the morning put it in the baking dish. Turned out wonderful again. You can do it either way and its easy and is super wonderful. Oh yeah, I guess I did not put in the whole sweet onion. I only put in half because the onion was huge...your preference.

We make this often all year long and love it! I often have to make two dishes, one with turkey sausage and one with bacon, for my school staff of 40. This Christmas we used Pepper Jack cheese instead of the Swiss cheese. Love the mild zippiness!

O.K. had my doubts, but served this, this morning to 15 Methodist gentlemen, and when I went to clean up after their meeting, couldn't find a scrap of leftovers!  I would call that a 5 star recipe!  By the way, other than doubling the ingredients, I used it just as written.
Thank you.

I made this as directions stated with the exception of sausage instead of bacon. However, it looks very dense. I'm afraid I've used to many hash browns (8 oz. per cup x 4 c. used 30 oz. bag of hash browns). I'm not baking until morning. Any suggestions? It's for a bridal shower and I hope I haven't screwed up... :-(

Tasty and easy to make ahead. I used gruyere instead of Swiss since I had it on hand. I didn't start with a big enough bowl so I spread the potatoes in the bottom of the pan, mixed everything else and poured on top. Refrigerated overnight and baked in the morning on convect setting so it was still done in about 45 min. Big hit at work for a team breakfast. I will be making again to serve at home!

This is one of our favorite make ahead breakfast casseroles.  I'm generally too lazy to deal w/bacon, so I typically use diced ham as the protein in it's stead.  I also add diced bell peppers to add some color and veg.  Great hearty easy breakfast when we have overnight guests.  THANKS for the recipe!

I make the this for my church's men's breakfast.  I use a pound of breakfast sausage rather than bacon, 12 eggs rather than 9, and a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes added in for good measure.  It's great.

My family is not big on cottage cheese or swiss cheese.  I use 4 1/2 cups of shredded Colby-jack and about 1cup of half-and-half milk mixed in with the eggs.  Very cheesy and good.

Made this in individual dishes for Christmas morning.  We were having breakfast sausage so left out the meat and added lightly cooked red pepper and onion.  Will make again tomorrow and as have a vegetarian in the family will again leave out the meat and add some mushrooms.  Was enjoyed by all!!

Thanks a great recipe

I made this about a month ago, and the whole family loved it!  Only thing I did different was I used a whole dozen eggs, instead of 9.  It was easy and made a lot.  Plus, the leftovers were even better.  It was so good I'm making it for our Christmas breakfast in place of my usual Christmas breakfast casserole recipe.

This is good as written.  I'm thinking a few tweaks for our taste buds will make it a semi-regular for us.  I seasoned it up on the first go-round, knowing we'd need some salt and pepper and a dash of garlic, but that wasn't quite enough.  The potatoes seemed to be the stand-out.  Next time, we'll go with extra meat (bacon or sausage or both), extra cheese, maybe some green chiles and 1-2 extra eggs.  This is good as-is, but for us, a few tweaks should make it just right.  Thanks for a bread-free breakfast casserole idea!

WONDERFUL!!! I didn't want to deal with cooking bacon, so I used real bacon bits. Made other minor changes due to what I had, but it is GREAT!  Also I only used 2 cups of cheese and that seemed to be enough and I'm a cheesy person!  **Update** This is the only thing I could eat in the morning while first trimester pregnant, and I knew it was better than nothing! I would make a batch and warm it everyday. Now with a newborn I have no time to make breakfast!! Here I am making a batch to reheat all week, otherwise it seems I don't get to eat till 3pm!!!

Made this last night, was fantastic despite the modifications.  Our hash browns didnt thaw completely so it took a little longer to cook.  We just used cheese we had on hand, so it was like 70% Jack cheese, 20% cheddar, and 10% parmesan, and it was delicious.  Would definitely make again and again, might even make it for a work gathering soon!

This was pretty good.  I did sub cubed ham I had in the freezer, I wanted to use up, but next time I will try the bacon, or a spicy sausage.

Used sausage instead of bacon and it turned out great. It does make an awful lot though.

Made this today for a "breakfast for dinner" at our church.  Super easy to make and soooo good!  Cleanup was a breeze too.  Used bacon this time, gonna switch some ingredients next time for a different taste.

This was a convenient and easy recipe to make and turned out delicious. Was a big hit with our guests! The changes we made were with the cheese and onion. We used shredded mexican cheese rather than what it called for and a red onion. YUM. Was still delicious heated up as leftovers. Thinking maybe next time we might try it with potatoes O'Brien rather than hash browns.

This was really good. I used mozzarella instead of swiss because it's what I had. Added salt and pepper, along with some liquid smoke. Easy to do and easy to alternate different meats.

Followed the recipe exactly as is and it was great!  I will probably add some chopped red peppers and mushrooms next time just to mix it up.  Maybe some spinach.

Everyone always loves this! Extremely versatile and easy to make. I tried chorizo instead of bacon the last time I made it and was out of cottage cheese so I used sour cream instead. My coworkers were blown away!

Made for a work function, tried with and without potatoes. I was a little apprehensive about adding the potatoes but I browned the potatoes a little first. It turned out really good. I actually preferred with the potatoes. It's so versatile and you can probably do a lots of different combinations.Will definitely make again.
I also made a new one I omitted the bacon and onions and added browned chorizo (drained the grease), diced jalapenos, Chihuahua Cheese, Swiss Cheese, I also browned the hash browns, cooked for 50 minutes. Turned out amazing!!

Not my first time making this just forgot to leave a review. Please forgive. Followed as printed the first time and it was absolutely delicious! Only lasted about 4 days !  Second time I reduced the cheese to 2 cups to try and cut the sodium and used fiesta blend cheese also added a cup of chopped spinach so I wouldn't feel so guilty consuming it!  It still taste amazing! Thank you so much for sharing!

I needed a new breakfast casserole recipe and actually found this same recipe on a different site. It is delicious as is! As with all breakfast casseroles, I made it the night before and stuck it in the fridge and baked it in the morning. I love the cottage cheese versus milk! Very creamy and delicious. This is a keeper.

I used bacon eggs and mayo instead of cottage cheese. Also, I pre- cooked the hash browns on a skillet with Canola oil to make them Crispy. I added 3 different cheeses. Absolutely love it. I wish I had sour cream to mix in though.

I LOVE this recipe! It's my go-to when I'm hosting brunch and want a load of happy guests. I usually make it exactly as the recipe directs (less the onions, because I have a house full of onion haters), but this last time, I baked it in muffin tins. The recipe made 24 muffin-sized portions. I baked them at normal temp for 33 minutes. After they cooked, I froze them separately and then put all the frozen bits-of-breakfast-goodness in a freezer ziplock. Two minutes in the microwave and whaallllaaa -- a hearty breakfast in a pinch.

It was perfect l. Doubled the recipe with 10 eggs and use 3 cups of cottage cheese. Made 2 pans. Refrigerated the leftovers and we all at it all week long. Used garlic, pepper, and a little salt. Best breakfast casserole!!!

I have been making breakfast casseroles for years. This one was by far the best. Creamy in texture & very flavorful as is. This recipe could easily be adapted with sausage and/or vegtables too. Perfect for a crowd or a Sunday brunch.

Great recipe base - thank you!  Made for Christmas morning today and was a huge hit.  A few don't eat pork so I used turkey bacon and only needed about 2/3 of a pack, and I added chopped fresh spinach to add some color (and a vitamin or 2). My store was sold out of shredded hash browns so I used tater tots as kind of a "crust".  My method was to cook the turkey bacon and onion together and bake the tater tots on a cooke sheet. Then I put a layer of tots at the bottom of the dish and the egg layer on top (I ended up using an extra 2 eggs bc it was SO thick).  I used the full amount of cheese but used what I had - cheddar, montery jack and colby I think. I'm sure any cheese would be great, and do include the cottage cheese.  Everyone loved it!

This was delicious.. I used the cubed kind of hash browns that had onion and peppers mixed in it and added an extra egg but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cottage cheese is a must.. it gives the right amount of creamy texture and saltiness to this dish. It also reheats really well. This recipe will work with any kind of meat you prefer. Next time I think I’ll try sausage or ham. Overall, awesome recipe I’ll definitely make again.

Made this for Christmas breakfast. I put it together the night before and refrigerated and baked in the morning.  Used 9x13 glass pan and one extra egg.  This was delicious and everyone raved about it! Definitely a keeper!

This was good. I like it with a couple more eggs and some seasoning. Like others suggested, I browned the hashbrowns first and put them on the bottom only.  Green onions would be a nice touch as well for next time. You do not taste the cottage cheese at all, but it's needed for consistency. Overall, this was good.

This recipe is great. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. The only thing I did that made it better the second time was to place the hash browns in the oven until browned. You could add it to the sautéed onion and bacon. Don’t leave the hash browns raw, they won’t cook and it’s not appealing.

I think this is great though I did substitute sausage for the bacon.  I used frozen O'Brien potatoes and it came together very well. I made it the night before and put in the refrigerator then in the morning put it in a 350 degree oven for 70 minutes and it came out great.  I followed another suggestion and thawed and drained the potatoes before using and it turned out great.

Love Breakfast for Dinner! I love this recipe but it's pretty bland! Now don't get me wrong bland isn't always bad! Sometimes we need bland in our live but I feel it would kick it up a notch to add some more flavor (ex: onions & peppers) but then again I don't think it would be Amish Cheesy Breakfast Casserole anymore?!? But just be cautious if you add more ingredients be prepared to have it in the oven a little longer.

I chose this breakfast casserole because it includes potatoes, and I needed to feed several hungry men. It went together easily and tasted delicious. No leftovers from a double batch! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I cutout the cottage cheese and used sausage versus bacon and it was good. I used a whole pound of the hashbrowns, but next time I will use less. I made this in a 13×9 because I have growing children who eat everything but our house. I also used 14 eggs and 2lbs of sausage. 350 for 30 minutes and it ca mlm e out perfect. Might try cottage cheese next time as long as I can't taste it much.

I made some changes to use what I had on hand.  Half the bacon and Mozzarella  & Provolone since I didn't have Swiss.

Everybody loved it and my granddaughter asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I noticed there were no spices at all added, not even salt and pepper. So I added those, some chives and basil and a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes. I’m sure it would work with many other spice combos, too. For me, it would be too plain without any spices. I would have never thought to add cottage cheese, which did make it creamy!

For anyone wondering if you can make this in a crockpot you totally can.  I made it in a crockpot and it came out fine.  I modified by using a dozen eggs and adding turkey sausage.  I made it the night before and got up in the morning and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  It was perfect .  I worried it would be dry but it came out great and the entire crockpot was empty by the group that I made it for.

Tremendous! I only used 12 ounces of uncured hickory bacon and added 3 more eggs.... I also minced my own fresh potatoes and used about half the cheese it called for (this is a VERY fattening recipe otherwise)! It was delicious. I believe the secret to success in this recipe is the cottage cheese!

Fantastic! I made this vegetarian by first sauté wing onions, then bell pepper and tomato (be sure to add corn starch so it’s not too runny). Loaded it with black pepper as well. I didn’t have Swiss so I nearly doubled the cheddar and added more cottage cheese. It was a hit at my 12-person brunch; I’ll be keeping this recipe as a household staple!

I make this at least three or four times a year. Absolutely delicious.   Always a hit!   The leftovers may be even better than eating it fresh out of the oven.

I love this recipe as is, but I love it even more when I take it over the top:  use only 1/2 lb. bacon and add 1.2 lb. cooked mild or hot breakfast sausage, chopped ham, chopped onion, red and green bell pepper and mushrooms, and then add another egg or 2, since I added so much more to it.  It's very versatile and you can do whatever sounds good to you---maybe some jalapeno, red pepper flakes or hot sauce! I sometimes even serve it with salsa or some bacon gravy!! Thanks for posting this---we LOVE IT!!!

Added red and green peppers and used tator tots instead of hash browns as they get crispier.  Guests asked for the recipe!!!

This was great - so simple & delicious.  And a bonus that it was gluten free.  
I was making this for just 4 of us  so I adjusted the recipe to make 7 servings & baked in a deep pie pan.   We had just a small amount left.

I made this just as directed and thought it was very good, as well as easy to make.
The only change I will make for the next time will be to crisp the bacon before adding the onion, as directed.
This can be changed in a million ways to suite personal tastes, or to use up whatever you have on hand.

Delicious. I made it exactly as written (other than splitting it in half and cooking in two smaller pans so I could freeze some for upcoming family visit). It was phenomenal and I can see adding different types of breakfast meat such as ham and sausage or even different veggies going forward. A really versatile recipe and a big hit. Can’t wait to make it again.

Made this for an office potluck. I didn’t change a thing and it turned out well. No leftovers so I would say was a hit. Will be making again using variations others have suggested. Thank you for a great recipe

I have made this recipe several times, it's always a hit! Today I made a half recipe for just my husband and I. instead of bacon I used leftover ham steak, added green peppers with the onions and popped a few jalepeno slices on top. Yum!

Subbed out Swiss for pepper jack and added 1/2 can drained diced tomatoes and chiles for a southwest version! I also only added 1/2 lb of ground sausage instead of the bacon and it came out perfect.

I made this recipe as written for a Mother's Day brunch and we all thought it was just okay. It needs something more -- more seasoning, spicy sausage instead of bacon or additional ingredients. However, my one-year-old grandson liked it, so its blandness might make it appealing to children.

I love an easy breakfast casserole and thought I would give this a try! I split it into two 8 x 8 pans.  One exactly as the recipe stated and one with green pepper and sausage instead of bacon.  They were both good, but, we preferred the sausage and pepper.  I also added some salt and pepper for seasoning.  I did think it tasted more like a hash brown casserole.  I didn’t really taste the eggs with all the hash browns used.  It was extra cheesy which we loved.  We thought it was better the next day reheated. Thanks for the recipe!

I did make a few changes when I read thru the reviews.  I did sprinkle cinnamon on top of the first and second layers of bread.  I used Italian bread and can see where regular bread would become soggy.    I had rave reviewed at our Easter Brunch and brought along the extra maple syrup to put on top of each individual serving.  People were asking for the recipe.  Very sweet and very rich.  But loved this recipe.  It was easy for someone who does not like to cook.  Will make this again.

Served this at Easter. Everyone LOVED it. I didn’t have Swiss cheese so I used mozzarella. I had a lot of people coming so I added two additional cups of hash browns.  Left it in the oven on timed cook for 50 minutes while we at church and it was warm and perfect when we returned 2+ hours later. Definitely making again!

Fine, but rather boring. I cut the recipe in half in order to just make a 8x8 instead of 9x13, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. The cottage cheese was an interesting addition - I wasn't sure how that would turn out, but it was fine and blended in perfectly. This recipe just needs something else to "punch it up" a little. Maybe Browning the hash browns first? Maybe adding some other veggies, like bell pepper or mushrooms?

Made this for a brunch and it was really nice and easy to make. I couldn't find shredded hash browns so I used the diced kind. While this turned out okay I wouldn't substitute again since the diced potatoes were a big part of every mouthful. Great recipe because it has everything in it for a breakfast dish including bacon. Will definitely make this again and again.

Bacon used was lean so nothing to drain... Added a Tbsp olive oil to skillet before bacon... 32 ounce bag of diced hash browns is 6 to 7 cups so measure them to get 4 cups... Discrepancy between cooking time per video narrative and written recipe... 40 minutes seems ideal

Family favorite!  I subbed mozzarella instead of Swiss and put kielbasa chunks in the casserole.  Instead of putting the bacon inside it, I crumbled it and added it to the top the last 15 minutes of baking.  Great recipe and tons of leftovers that freeze well.  I made portions for my husband to take to work for breakfast/ brunch.

Made as recipe was written. Very good taste! I did put the hash browns in a layer by itself as the hubs is dieting. So many possibilities with this one. Think I'll do less or no onion next time and maybe add mushrooms. Good recipe.

the fail is likely my own doing. I had high hopes, and followed the recipe adding sauteed asparagus spears, however the flavor was too bland and the mine did not bake to a firm enough consistency. It was too moist, I know, how is that even a thing? Anyway, the idea is good. I just couldn't pull this one off.

I made this low carb style.  I omitted the potatoes, thought about using riced cauliflower but mine was frozen and scared of water content I opted for fresh spinach and 1/2 red bell pepper.  I also used a new cheese from taco bell called salsa verde which added more flavor.  I season everything even if not called for, added black pepper salt on top and when I cooked the onions/pepper and spinach in the bacon grease I added ground dried garlic by pampered chef.  Alittle cholula sauce ontop if you want a kick at serving and you have an awesome low carb meal with added nutrients from veggies.

It was a delicious recipe.  I did add mushrooms and red, orange and green bell pepper diced up.  Topped with more cheddar cheese right out the oven.  Served with grits and sliced tomatoes.  Could eat all by itself.  Highly recommended!

This casserole turned out amazing! Only thing I didn’t follow was chopping the bacon and onion up in pieces, and cooking it together.. I cooked the bacon then sliced it up in bigger pieces and cooked the onion in a little bit of the bacon grease turned out amazing!!!

This was a huge hit at my workplace.  Only change I made was adding garlic and onion powder - also used Southwest Hashbrowns.  The bell peppers give it a nice flavor.

Everyone in my house really liked this recipe although I did not make it as written but used the concept. I didn't use Swiss Cheese or Cottage Cheese but instead used a Monterey Blend as well as a Extra Sharp Cheddar Blend. I also used red, green, and yellow peppers and onion in my potatoes. In my egg mixture I added some Ricotta Cheese and some milk. After cooking my casserole a half an hour I topped it with more cheese to finish it for 15 - 20 minutes more. Side note:  I always season the potatoes as well as the egg mixture!

This is really tasty recipe in its original form. I have made some adjustments over time to give it variety. I sub ham for the bacon add red bell when saute' the ham and onion. Wilt spinach, then squeeze all the water out of it. Add some garlic powder, salt and pepper. My family loves it every time.

Wow!  Everybody thought It tasted phenomenal! FYI I love salty foods and this was plenty salty without any additional salt.  Used normal cheeses , bacon and even a additional cup of hash brown and 2 eggs.  If I was doing it again I'd not increase those because I love FLAVOR and those would tend to dilute it.

This was a tasty and easy dish to bring to a morning buffet with friends! I used cooked, ground chicken sausage, because that's what I had on hand. I also added a bit of salt and a bunch of ground pepper. No Swiss cheese in the fridge, but it still tasted great with a mix of Cheddar/Jack and the cottage cheese.

This is a favorite with the family.  After following the recipe exactly the first time, I made some tweaks - I cook the hash browns on the stove with onion, garlic and pepper (red, yellow, or orange) before adding to the casserole.  As other reviewers have noted, the cottage cheese is a must, but I usually experiment with other cheeses depending on what's in the frig.  I often use sausage instead of bacon.  This is a versatile recipe that you can modify to your tastes.

Everyone at our brunch enjoyed this casserole. After reading other reviews I added green and red bell peppers, a tsp of garlic salt and ground mustard. I also pre cooked the thawed hash browns in the bacon fat.

I have to say,  this was the Winning dish at my brunch. I made three different brunch casseroles and this was  hands down the best,   proven by the number of folks going back for seconds and thirds.     So next time, I'm making three of this recipe.   Note: Resist the urge to decrease the amount of liquid or cheese.   You want this to be rich and succulent when serving it up.  It will hold together if you allow it to sit 20 minutes before cutting into it after baking.     No regrets here!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and it was amazing as written. All 10 of my family members cobbled this up and went back for seconds. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I made it and altered the recipe a bit. Used roughly the same cheese quantities, but a little more meat. A pound of turkey bacon, diced and a package of turkey polish sausage, diced with onions and green peppers. Due to the excess meat I used 12 eggs instead of 9. I’ve also made a veggie version before with mushrooms and spinach as subs for the meat. Both were great! Made some for my family recently and every one loved it! There was none leftover. This is one of my favorite recipes for breakfast. So easy and delicious!

I had 12 people over for a short notice family get together after Christmas.  I doubled the recipe except I used 13 eggs instead of 18.  Everyone liked it and wanted the recipe.  The doubled amount fit into my deep dish La Crueset Lasagna pan. This is a keeper.

Very nice recipe.  I chose this one because my mom doesn't like sausage and also because I like potatoes in my breakfast casserole.  I did cook the potatoes slightly before putting them in the casserole to get rid of any excess water and give them a little crunch and flavor.  I didn't use the swiss cheese because I was afraid the swill flavor would overpower the recipe.  Next time I will make it in a half batch for my smaller family group and use the swiss.  Very good as written.

I made it for New Years Day. Excellent taste. I agree with some of the other reviews to add more eggs. I used 12 which was perfect.  

I do think possibly adding 1/4 or so of heavy cream might make it a little creamier. I cooked it 40 minutes and it was a tad on the dry side. I may have been the dish I used though which seemed a bit larger than 13x9 but I'm not sure.

Overall this is an outstanding and easy recipe. You can also substitute what you have on hand. I didn't have swiss but i had 2 kinds of cheddar plus some pepper jack so I just used that. I also added some diced jalapeno's.  I also added some fresh grated Parm on top for the last 10 minutes or so. This gave it a very good flavor.

This is a great recipe and a keeper. Great flavor. Will definitely be keeping this one for the future.

This is an excellent recipe for groups.  It is easily added, or subtracted for the number of servings you want....,(make plenty, you'll want left-overs). 
Easily prepared, and although it was not mentioned, I made this the night before.  BE SURE to thaw the frozen hash browns before incorporating.

Ok, this was a HUGE hit, even with my very picky father!  3 people asked me for the recipe!  I prepared the dish on Christmas Eve, & put plastic wrap over it, & put it in the fridge.  The next day, I pulled it out of the fridge about 15 minutes before baking it.  
I also made some small adjustments that were totally worth it...  First, I added about 1-1/2 tsp of pepper to the mixture.  Second, I used 2 pounds of bacon.  I put 1/2 of the bacon in the casserole (with onions), but the other half of the cooked bacon (no onions) I set aside until the casserole was almost done.  The last 5 minutes of baking, I sprinkled the rest of the bacon on top, & turned it to broil to crisp up the bacon.  It was a HUGE hit!  Seriously, my father is picky, and he couldn't get enough of it!   
Along with this casserole, I made some very easy grilled french toast using thick Texas Toast (egg, milk, vanilla, & cinnamon)- that was also a huge hit, especially if you grill on a skillet or griddle until golden brown & crispy on the outside.  I will no doubt be making both of these dishes again!

The was decent, but definitely needed some more flavor. I thought it was extremely bland.  I'd also make sure to brown the bacon a few minutes BEFORE you add the onion since the onion adds quite a bit of moisture to the pan.

I made this for Christmas morning because I didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It was easy to put together and everyone enjoyed it. I used the Obrien potatoes and made a half recipe. I will be making this again for sure.

Added sausage along with the bacon, and couldn't find Swiss cheese.  This casserole was great though, and I think the cottage cheese was the difference maker. We have found a new go-to breakfast casserole recipe!

I took this to a potluck tonight. It was a hit. People went back for seconds until there was not a bite left. I miscalculated what time I needed to start making it so didn’t get it in the oven on time. I increased the temp to 400 and baked it for 35 minutes. It came out just fine.

I choose to grate, rinse and dry fresh potatoes for this recipe. They came out slightly undercooked in the casserole but wasn’t an issue to anyone eating it. Next time, I’ll cook the potatoes in a skillet for a bit before adding to the mixture.

I made this and used the shredded hash browns instead of the diced.  Turned out tasty!  Will make again.

This was the best breakfast casserole I've ever tasted! It was just the right blend of cheesy, potato, and savory bacon. The cottage cheese was a subtle but delicious touch. I made exactly as is, and topped with a tiny bit of sriracha when I ate it. Soooooo good!

I made this for 8 people this morning, and everyone loved it. There was enough for some to have seconds and there was some left over. I made it with sausage and served bacon on the side. The only thing that I will change next time is in the baking. It didn't specify whether or not to cover it while baking, so maybe I should have assumed not to cover it. I will not cover it next time, since after almost an hour of baking it was still uncooked. I uncovered it and baked about 1/2 hour longer, let it sit for 10 minutes after it came out, and it was perfect. Breakfast was a little late, but everyone agreed that it was worth the wait.

Our whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I added a bit more cheese than it called for (shredded blocks of cheese and used it all) and a few more eggs and bacon.  The taste was great and it was a hit.

I made this exactly how the recipe says. This dish is amazingly delicious as is but my family and I all agreed that there is a flavor missing. We thought about it over the course of the meal and came up with browned breakfast sausage "original flavor" added into the bacon and sweet onion cooking step.  I will defiantly make this dish again with the added ingredient and if it turns out good I'd let everyone know.

Everyone loves this.  I've made many breakfast casseroles and this one is the best.  I cook my bacon and onion the day before to save time.  We like it better than the bread based overnight casseroles.  Delicious!

Worked great. Added more meat (1lb bacon and 1lb sausage) and four more eggs to help with added meat. Made it easy on myself and just baked it in cast iron that I used for meat.

I made this for my weekly Tuesday morning Women's Bible study this morning and was thrilled that it was a big hit!  I made the recipe as is.  The only issue I had was that I was going to use weighted measures instead of "cups".  For example, 2 cups of cheddar = 16 oz.  When I did that for  the cheddar and the potatoes, I wouldn't have had room in the 9 x 13 for all the ingredients!  So I went back and used the cup method (which didn't use as much of the ingredient).  Nevertheless, I came home with an empty dish and several people told me it was really good.  (Next time I might use the suggestion of one of the other commentators, and brown the hash browns a little first to give them a bit of color and "toothiness").

Substituted ham for the bacon, added green pepper and fresh slice mushrooms.  AMAZING!  Served Christmas morning to my family and was a huge huge hit.  Now its requested at least once a month.

Very good as others have already noted. Used my own additions like ham and spinach and omitted the Swiss cheese (due to dietary restrictions around here can't have as much cheese). Instead of a casserole I used a large muffin tin to make individual portions: small layer of cooked shredded hash browns and fill with egg mixture then a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top. Going to see how well they freeze and reheat for an easy breakfast when needed! Tasted superb with the cottage cheese and is very flexible for whatever one wants.

I love it and so does my whole family! So easy to prepare and  simple ingredients. I tweaked it a little bit and added cream of mushroom and used 3 cheese blend instead and cottage cheese. Adding spam bits with the bacon made it more delicious

This was so good! I made it on a Sunday to eat for breakfast all week. Still delicious on Friday morning! Next time, I think I will add some ingredients like tomatoes or spinach and more cheese. But, as is, it’s a great dish.

I followed the recipe to the letter and this turned out perfect. It has just the right consistency and the flavor is fantastic. Very hearty without being too greasy or too bready like a few other recipes I have tried. Five stars.

Made this a few days ago. Family loved it and wants it again.

One thing I'd request of the publisher. Please add number of servings and nutrition values to recipe print pages so we don't have to google recipes every time we want to cook it.

Pretty good result, but a bit dry.  I should have cut down the cooking time by 20 minutes.  I also found it fairly bland, and used hot sauce liberally - as did my guests.  I used old cheddar and excellent bacon from a butcher.  After cooking the onions and bacon in the skillet, I expected a better result.

My husband, who supposedly hates cottage cheese and green peppers loved this.  Went over well at a ladies brunch too.  I used O'Brien frozen potatoes (with green peppers) and browned them first.

I loved it and so did my co-workers. I did add some ham and red peppers. Since I added extra ingredients, I added a couple more eggs. I did also fry the hash browns and sauté the peppers before cooking the casserole just for the crunch. But the cottage cheese gave it the creaminess. It was delish. Will definitely make it again.

made it at least 6 times now. much prefer frozen spinach that can be thawed and patted dry, so it doesn't get watery. definitely added spinach, sometimes spicy sausage, minced jalepeno, mushroom. definitely need more eggs than stated in recipe (about 30 percent more). absolutely love this recipe. the best.

This is a great "base" recipe. You can add or delete as suits your family.  I was cooking for gluten-free and doesn't like breakfast meats.  The GF was no sweat and I just made one of the ends without Canadian Bacon.

Made this Mother's Day brunch and not a crumb was left behind. Everyone loved it! And it was so easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly except couldn't find shredded swiss cheese so used mozzarella. Also, followed the advice of others and made sure to actually squeeze out any moisture from the thawed hash browns, so perfect! Will definitely be making again!

The only things I changed is that I added asparagus and cooked it in a crockpot.

This was very good.  easy to put together and very tasty.  Everything all in one casserole.  The only change was to add the whole 16 oz container of cottage cheese.  There was only about 1/4 cup left anyway after measuring out the 1.5 cups.  I used small curd and didn't see any curds of cottage cheese.  This is a nice recipe because it can be seasoned to taste w/whatever a person likes in the breakfast.  I did add a bit of pepper, and only a small amt of salt d/t the amt already in the bacon and cheese.  really nice dish, very versatile.

This was pretty good - like many others I pre-baked the hash browns for about 15 minutes to make sure any moisture burned off so they wouldn't make it soggy. I used small curd cottage cheese, but the curds did not melt and dissolve in the mixture, which left little white dots throughout the dish which looked a little weird and unappealing, but the taste was fine.

I love this recipe, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars because it takes forever to make it! It takes an hour to bake plus the prep time. What temperature should I cook this in if I want the bake time to be shorter?

I have tried many breakfast casseroles in search of one that is tasty, easy, and I would like to make again and again. I found it with this recipe!!
I made this for breakfast this morning with only one change. I didn't have any swiss cheese on hand so substituted provolone. Fantastic! My husband loved it. Sturdy enough, eggy enough, cheesy enough, and we didn't need to add any salt or pepper for taste. Can't wait to try this again, maybe with a Mexican flair to it - pepper jack and cheddar cheeses, peppers, and sausage...  YUM!

Great base recipe! It's good the way it is, but I love to play with different ingredients. This last time I added kale (de stem leaves). Red pepper, Italian seasoning, marjoram, green onion, garlic salt and red pepper flakes, gruyere cheese and a shard cheddar.  With this recipe you can play around with all those crazy cheeses that  you see in the store that you are not sure what to do with. I used a merlot cheese once. OH MAN! So good. Happy cooking!

This turned out really good. I made a few changes for my family. I added about a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt to the cheese mixture and I used buffalo bacon instead of pork bacon. It turned out very flavorful.

This is very good. I added sweet peppers since the photo obviously had them and they sounded good to me. I also had Asiago cheese on hand so used that instead of Swiss.  Yum.

Very easy and yummy, I made it with turkey sausage crumbles, added a bag of shredded brussel sprouts and chopped baby portabello mushrooms.  I would definitely use the shredded hashbrowns or throw the cubed hashbrowns in with my sautee mix next time cause they were too crunchy this time.

This will be our new Christmas morning casserole.  Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing and the three of us ate it all in one sitting!!

Prepare it the night before and refrigerate overnight. Bake the next morning at 350 for 1 hour.

Definitely will make this again. I made this for a New Year's Day Brunch.  I only had 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of 2 cups. So I increased the Swiss cheese and cottage cheese to 2 cups each, to make up for it.  I also went with convenience and used store bought bacon pieces, instead of cooking my own bacon.  My husband is not a breakfast casserole fan and he went back for seconds.

This casserole turned out great. It will definitely be a go to casserole for all occasions.  To save time in the morning, I cooked the bacon and onion the day before and then just reheated it before adding it to the egg mixture.  It received rave reviews at the table!

I make this every year for Christmas....it is easy, flexible, and loved by everyone!  I double it, believe it or not.....because it is so delicious!  Want sausage instead of bacon?  easy!  have different kinds of cheeses?  easy!  want onions n bell peppers?  easy!  add spinach or artichokes...add green onion, experiment with cheeses, use diced ham or sausage or bacon....or even all of them!  This dish is perfect!

I have made this recipe about a half dozen times and it always comes out great. I have read the reviews and although many have tried to make it without the cottage cheese the response is overwhelming. You need the cottage cheese for creaminess. I am one of those people if it looks bad I can not force myself to eat it. Hence I can not bring myself to eat cottage cheese, the sight of it is makes me  nauseous, sorry. I really wanted to make this and thought about cottage cheese and what I could use. I have used ricotta cheese and a little milk mixed in and it is great. Other than that I follow the recipe as written I also use 10 eggs instead of 9, nice round number. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this for the breakfast after T'Day for 12 folks. Everyone raved and there was only a little left over. We are headed to our daughter's for Christmas, and I promised to bring it! (I hope I can bake it and freeze it!)

Made it as written. I was leery of the cottage cheese, but kept it in the recipe. The pan was demolished!! Definitely a keeper in my home.

Was served at a Bed and Breakfast. It was pre-cooked in individual ramekins and we only needed to microwave for 1 minute.  Loved that it could be cooked ahead of time and reheated. Delicious!

I took this to work and it completely disappeared. We all agreed it could use more cheddar cheese. I will have to double it next time. I used pre-cooked turkey breakfast sausage and southern hash browns (small diced potatoes.) Delicious!!!!

Very good! Used turkey sausage instead of bacon.  When the turkey was almost done then used a potato masher to make the sausage bites smaller.  Took the sausage out and used a little olive oil and cooked the onion, green pepper and red pepper then added to the rest of the ingredients.

Cheesy Amish Breakfast Casserole was the main meal at a work birthday brunch this week.   Everyone devoured it and requested the recipe.  I made two casseroles, one with bacon and added red pepper and the other with sausage.  I added an extra egg as well to both pans.    Made and baked these the night before and everyone heated their serving in the morning.   Delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

This was a big winner in my house this weekend! The only change I made was to use homemade turkey sausage in lieu of bacon as we didn't have any bacon in the house. Will definitely make this again and again - so tasty!

I made this.  Being a vegetarian and another vegetarian person in the house, so I omitted the bacon.  I added green & red peppers, and some fresh chopped hot pepper of some kind (not sure what it was - it came from my coworker's garden). 
 As many suggested, reduce the shredded potato to 3 cup and cook them before mixing/baking.  Oh, added some salt & pepper too. 

I must say I think it turned out to be pretty good!

I was looking forward to trying this after reading all of the rave reviews. Unfortunately, it ended up being really bland, even after adding in green bell pepper, red bell pepper and green chile. It was edible, but nothing that I'd want to make again. I'll have to keep searching for a good breakfast casserole.

This was very good! I omitted onion and added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Also added an 8 oz package of  diced ham.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was wonderful, but my husband thought there was too much onion. So the next time I made this, I only added 3/4 of the onion and added a full chopped red pepper. This was perfect for my husband and I. I guess what I am saying is this dish is delicious and versatile. :)

I would have given this 5 stars except that I had to slightly deviate from the recipe.  
I added 1lb sausage and omitted the Swiss (didn't have any on hand), instead I just added more cheddar jack.
I was concerned at first I wasn't going to get it all in the casserole dish, but I mushed it down and it worked out GREAT!  The whole family enjoyed it immensely, and it left them wanting more.  This will be my go-to breakfast casserole from now on, next time I will try different ingredients like Rotel (drained), Ham or maybe even fresh mushrooms and asparagus.

After reading the reviews, I cooked the bacon and onions separately.  I seasoned the hashbrowns, onions and eggs with salt.  I also added a can of chopped green chilies, which was delicious.  My office loved it!  My hubby got to taste it before it left the house.  He can't wait for me to make it for us.  He loved it too!

This is my go-to recipe for Christmas morning, EVERY SINGLE YEAR.  I make it before we start to open gifts, let it bake and when we are ready we just have to make toast.  This is a SUPER simple recipe and it is seriously, DELICIOUS..!!!! I follow it exactly, except I do double it.  I mix it all together but when I separate it into two pans, I leave one as is and the other one I had some Frank's Red Hot.  So we have one spicy pan and one regular pan.  You won't be sorry for choosing this for breakfast.

I made this last year for our Church's Easter Breakfast and I brought home an empty  dish!  I made it for my husband and he said it was great to have it ready to eat when he wanted a snack or a fast breakfast to take with him.  I will make this again for this year's Church's Easter Breakfast.  It is a big winner with this family!!

Great dish!  We like sausage instead of bacon and I use hashbrowns for the potatoes.  It is very forgiving in that I don't have to use exact measurements of the cheeses.  I have also made it a few times subbing in sour cream for some of the cottage cheese.  Comes out great every time!

Great recipe!  Served to guests and everyone was happy.  Especially me!  In addition to ease and taste, another great thing about this meal is that it reheats well.  I purposely made extra for just that reason.

This casserole is great on it's own, but you also can add whatever you want.  I added green chilies and a little hot sauce one time and mushrooms and sausage another time and both were excellent. Remember the more things you add, you might have to add more eggs.   I also cut the recipe in half and it turned out great.  Wonderful re-heated too!  This will be my go-to-recipe for breakfast casseroles!  Thanks for the recipe

This is now my favorite go-to breakfast casserole.  I did not have an onion on hand so I added one package of onion soup mix.  It was a big hit.

Made as directed.  Makes for a delicious breakfast casserole that is not too heavy or oily.  My 18 year old son requested it for his birthday breakfast this year.

This will now be our family favorite breakfast casserole.  We had it Christmas morning and it was a good thing I had made two 9x13 pans because they were both gone. I will try some of the suggestions too. All ages loved it; 1yr - 85years.  Delicious!

Delicious and so easy! The only change I made was using Potatoes O'Brien (the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes with peppers and onions) instead of plain hash browns and chopped onions. I thawed them on defrost in the microwave and then squeezed with a paper towel to make sure I got out the excess moisture. I mixed this up the night before and put it in the fridge overnight, then baked it for 1 hour in the morning. Perfect, and everyone raved about it! (I was a bit apprehensive about the cottage cheese and swiss since my family doesn't like either of those things, but you couldn't taste them at all.) Great leftover, too.

This is the fourth time I've made this - and I did manage to screw it up a bit this time around. Someone had suggested browning the potatoes before mixing them in, and I did this time around. That didn't work for me and seemed to make it more dry. That said, everyone still liked it and the other times I've made it were fantastic. I do add both sausage and bacon and usually red or green bell pepper to the egg mixture. Yum.

I've made this countless times. I always use chorizo sausage in lieu of bacon, not because I don't love bacon, but because it makes the casserole unique when served with others. I get requests to make this for my kids' school breakfast pitch-ins often.

To die for. Excellent with no changes. The second time I added   extra bacon (used precooked and chopped it), cheeses, and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, and cooked it in the convection oven for 35 min. Even better!

I followed the recipe except that instead of Swiss cheese, I just used more cheddar and put the last 1.5 cups on top. (I actually used a Mexican blend cheese since that is what I had on hand)

I made this twice already, the first time I followed the recipe, and the second time I added red bell pepper (like the picture) and went with ½ bacon and ½ sausage.  Both times the baking pan was licked clean.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!!!

I made this last weekend for family gathered at my house.  I got many compliments and asked for recipe by both my sister and daughter.  Both plan to make it for their crowds soon.  We did add a little diced pepper, and used 8 oz. of diced ham instead of bacon or sausage.  I would make it exactly the same next time.

Made it for church fellowship hour and it was delicious!  Used 1 lb of ground sausage from local market & fresh eggs.  Instead of onion I used an onion spice blend.  It was amazing - thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! This is a keeper! It's very versatile. I used 1 lb Italian sausage, frozen spinach (thawed, and all liquid squeezed out), an orange bell pepper sauteed with the onions too. Oh and since I forgot to defrost the hash browns, I shredded some gold potatoes, soaked in water/ drain, repeat to get some starch out, then wrung out in a clean dish towel to dry out. Then I sauteed them to cook til almost done.  I did also use closer to a dozen eggs too. Mixed it all up and put in pan the night before. Oven for about 50 mins in the morning. I know, I mucked with the recipe a bunch but that's what's so good about it, you can use it as a base recipe and vary to what you have.

3.5 Starts as written, 4 with changes.  Definitely need to season the potatoes, otherwise the dish is extremely bland!  I made it the 1st time 'as is' before making the 2nd time for a work pot luck.  The 2nd time around I seasoned the potatoes with salt, pepper, onion powder (because the onion had disintegrated while cooking it with the bacon) and I threw in 1/4 of parmesan cheese.  I stored everything, except eggs, overnight in the dish and then added the eggs and baked in the morning.  I also increased the eggs to 12 for 9 x 13 pan, anything less would be dry.  Sprinkled additional shredded cheddar on top. A few minor tweaks but helped with the overall taste. It was the 1st item to go that day!

It was absolutely delicious; I will definitely make this again.  One thing, however, I did not dice the bacon. I simply cooked it until I could crumble it into the rest of the Ingredients. After I remove the bacon, I then cooked the onions in the bacon grease and added them, as well, to the rest of the ingredients.

Delicious! I have now made this with bacon, ham, no meat, and bell peppers. My favorite is with diced ham. It is my go to breakfast casserole. It is also great as leftovers, heated in the microwave.

I used the pre-cooked bacon bits.  May have been the problem.  I'd try it again, though.

I've made this breakfast multiple times, and it never fails to impress.  I usually add more eggs and have substituted cooked crumbled sausage.  I prefer the bacon, but the sausage was also well received.  My daughter is gluten intolerant.  This casserole is the answer to breakfast when I feed a crowd.

Loved this, made a few additions.. Added a little Jimmy Dean Sausage I had left over, sauteed a red pepper with the onion, used 12 eggs instead and used pepper jack instead of swiss.  Boys loved it and there is hardly any left.

I use ham instead of bacon. I also usually saute mushrooms or red pepper along with the onion.  Works great to do the prep the night before then mix it all together & bake in the morning.

YUMMY!I'll start by saying I usually don't like breakfast casseroles but...I love this one. I made it according to the recipe and it was perfect. For convenience sake I fried the bacon and onions the day before so that in the morning I could get it in the oven sooner.

Easy and yummy. I have tried it in a couple different ways, including with mild Italian turkey sausage. Have also added  a fajita onion and pepper blend sauteed then added to the mix. Always a hit in this house.

If you're looking for a delicious breakfast casserole, look no further!! This is the easiest and best recipe that packs the most flavor. I did as a pp did and used fresh, golden Yukon potatoes that I shredded and sauteed with the cooked bacon (soaking up all that bacon fat). Yum, yum!! Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was so so good and gobbled up by my guests!

Delicious! Brought it to work for a breakfast club and everyone raved about it! A couple changes I made were: instead of bacon I cut up pre cooked ham steaks and threw it in. I also used Monterey Jack instead of Swiss cheese, just a taste preference.

I've made this for two brunches, and I never have leftovers (darnit).  I do add one red and one green bell pepper; I like the color it adds, as well as flavor.  I think that would also be a good addition when I make this at Christmas time too.

I followed the recipe closely and it came out perfectly.  I made and cooked it the night before, refrigerated it, then put it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes in the morning, and we had a delicious breakfast.  It reheats well.

Turned out very well- it was very good.  I add two extra eggs to make a little extra as well as 1tsp salt.  I thought it was odd the recipe didn't include salt, it definitely needed it.  I thought 4 cups of potatoes was too much- next time I'll cut it to 2 cups.  I followed someone else's suggestion to brown potatoes 1st.  I thought this helped.  I might add sausage next time (then I wouldn't need salt).  The cottage cheese  makes it different than all others & I like that it doesn't include bread!

I made this for a crowd at a cottage gathering of friends (25 people) about half of whom were vegetarian.    So the first I did exactly as the recipe calls, except with diced honey maple ham instead of bacon.  One other slight alteration - I found fresh (not frozen) shredded hash browns which a friend recommended and I used.  I made a second batch without meat and adding spinach and mushrooms instead.   I contemplated adding a few hot peppers however, not all were fans of heat so I did not.    Both dishes were a hit!  Very delicious and filling.    I personally would perhaps add garlic to the vegetarian version next time, and I actually think you could increase the cheese slightly as I found it a wee bit dry.   This may be personal taste however - as others I asked found it to be quite cheesy enough!   A great dish for a crowd and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent dish.  I doubled and browned the hash browns the second time I made this.  Layered them in the bottom of the pan.  Added sundried minced tomatoes to the egg mixture and some red and green peppers that I sautéed along with the onions. Almost didn't have to wash the pan.  It vanished in minutes.  I used low sodium ham the first time and diced turkey sausage the second time.  I hate to cook bacon so this was just lazy on my part.  This is a great basic recipe that can be adapted to whatever you have on hand or personal preference.  On my third try I think I will stick with the sundried tomatoes and substitute feta for the cheddar, leave out the peppers and use fresh oregano.  We have Saturday coffee once a month at  our seasonal Florida condo.  I have been trying out new brunch casseroles, so far this is # 1.  I agree with one reviewer that the cottage cheese is a must.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I don't know how anyone could ever go wrong with cheese, eggs, and potatoes all baked together so this is delicious. It's a super customizable recipe, I love adding sautéed mushrooms, and great to make ahead and then microwave to save yourself time in the morning before work. I love the idea of adding cottage cheese to boost protein.

I've  made this many times. I've followed it exactly and I've made it with modifications like not adding the cottage cheese or I've added sausage and green peppers. It's always excellent! I've had requests to bring it when we camp with other families. We have a camper so I bake it in our oven and serve it hot on our brisk camping mornings. I normally use egg beaters instead of regular eggs, mozzarella cheese instead of swiss, and I always cook it at least 15 min. longer than the recipe states.

A family favorite  and one of the few breakfast casseroles that doesn't require refrigeration overnight.  It's also great reheated the next day and easily frozen!

Made it exactly as recipe stated and it was AWESOME!  My hubby doesn't like cottage cheese but I didn't tell him and he didn't complain!  Took it to a church meeting and got wonderful reviews!  Thanks for sharing!

On Christmas morning, I made a double batch for my local & out of state family visiting for the holidays.  Both batches were gone by 10am!  It gave them the fuel they needed to help me set up and finish cooking for 27 people Christmas Day.  What an absolute hit!  Thank you  :)

Fantastic!  I was scared of the cottage cheese but made it as written and it's incredible.    A few tips - a bag of Ore Ida Frozen Hashbrowns from my Grocery is MORE than 4 cups - so be sure to measure these!  Looks like this may be what some of the low rating folks may have missed since the other ingredients used the whole pack/container.  Also my local Kroger store carries shredded Swiss which was a time saver.  Finally you can bake bacon in the oven (see Barefoot Contessa's recipe) and/or use the Costco pre-cooked bacon crumbles to save effort & time.  :)

This is the best breakfast casserole. Have made it often and there is never any left. The only thing I do differently is to cook the bacon and onion separately so I can drain the bacon well.

I used turkey sausage and added diced peppers. I also took someone else's advice and crisped the hash browns and lined the bottom of the dish with them... I didn't think the hash browns were even noticeable this way- so I might just try mixing them in next time.  I was a little concerned because after mixing everything together, it seemed super dense- as if there wasn't enough egg in the mixture...  so I threw an extra egg in as well. 

It turned out great and my brunch guests were impressed. It also reheats well for breakfast  thru the week!

A very easy recipe and excellent. To make it easier, use the prepared bacon bits from Costco. I suspect they will also cut the grease factor. Additionally, the second time I made this dish I used hash browns from the refrigerator section (such as the ones for camping) rather than frozen ones. Perfect substitutions.

Made it with sausage, half the onion... My family loved even my husband who hates cottage cheese. The thawed and dried the hash browns with a paper towel. I also used 9 eggs, but mixed them in my ninja to make them fluffier. I will definitely make this again, I might even try it in muffin cups for a quick weekday breakfast.

Turns out great and is easy to make. Generally make it when we have company and it is usually cleaned up. Everyone thinks the cottage cheese is an interesting ingredient yet delish!

I have been making this every Christmas for the past 5 years.  I make this with either bacon or sausage.  I don't use swiss cheese I always substitute it with any other type of shredded cheese since my family does not like swiss

This is what I bring to most work potlucks as it is quick and easy, feeds a crowd, and everyone loves it.  Adaptable to whatever you have on hand.  Switch up the meat or leave it out.  Throw in some spinach, mushrooms, and peppers.  I like pepper jack cheese.  I've even used tater tots in a pinch and nobody said a word.  You can't even tell there is cottage cheese in here, but don't leave it out because it bumps up the protein and adds makes it nice and creamy.

I made it with a little more cheese than it calls for.  It is great, and is really a crowd pleaser.  I have made it one day and refrigerated it overnight to cook in the morning.  You need to add about 35 minutes to the cook time if it's cold, but the recipe comes out great!  I made it for our varsity football team for a breakfast meeting and many of them came back for seconds.  My boys all love it and I'm making it this weekend because by college sophomore wants the leftovers to eat before class in the morning.

I made this and it was a big hit!  I didn't have bacon, so I used two packages of 12 ounce reduced fat sausage.  I also didn't have Swiss cheese, so I cut about an inch stack of sliced American cheese into strips, and separated it all into the beaten eggs to keep it from clumping.  I used fresh potatoes, peeled and diced, and then put them on a plate between paper towels.  I microwaved them for 9 minutes, 3 minutes at a time, carefully stirring them in between.  By the time I put it all together to bake, the potatoes were almost completely done.  Came out perfect.  (I've had trouble getting potatoes to finish cooking in casseroles like this.  That's why I precooked the potatoes.)  I'll be making this again... I'm under orders to.  :)

One of my favorite breakfast casseroles.  I make it with diced ham and mexican cheese for variation.  I also make it the night before and cook it overnight in the crock pot on low so it's ready to go in the morning.

My daughter rides in a fun horse show once a month from April through September. When looking for a breakfast dish to bring to share I found this recipe. It was about 2012 I think. It was a big hit right away! Every time I try something else everyone requests this casserole! So this is made about 5 times a year and pretty much gets eaten up. If not, it's not because there's not enough, everyone eats their fill!

Loved this!  I didn't have bacon so I used sausage.  Made two.  One had regular breakfast sausage, the other had hot sausage.  Made it for breakfast at church and both were awesome.  Can't wait to try it again with bacon!

Delicious!  I have made this several times for different folks and everyone, young and old alike, love it.  There won't be much leftover but anything you do have warms easily covered in the oven.  One suggestion I have is to fry the bacon while in strip form until crisp, drain, and chop instead of chopping raw bacon and frying until crisp. Your bacon will be hold less grease this way.  Thanks for a great casserole.

I have made this several times as a treat for my high school students - and they all LOVE it!  I usually just use real bacon pieces or a pound of cooked sausage. I've never had it fail. Since I usually bake it early in the morning, I mix everything the night before and put it in a large Ziplock bag. In the morning, I cut off a large corner of the bag and squeeze it into the pan. No mess and the bags take up less space in the fridge and are easier to transport to bake at school.

This was great! It was a hit with the group of friends I invited over for brunch. I used an Italian blend cheese instead of Swiss (I'm not a Swiss fan), and I used 1-1/2 C of Mexican blend cheese since it's what I had on hand. The casserole turned out perfectly; this recipe is a keeper!

easy & delicious! I wondered about no seasoning, but honestly it didn't need anything.

Made it for an Easter sunrise service breakfast at our church today. Everybody thought it was the bomb! Will definitely make this bad boy again.

I like to add quartered cherry tomatoes and frozen broccoli, for added flavor and color. Minced garlic adds to this too. You can add or take away ingredients to suit your family's tastes and this is still wonderful. I usually  go with 12 eggs. Thanks for posting. :)

I served this for a family get together and I doubled the batch.  I fed 15 people and had 2 pieces left over.  It was delicious! Everyone loved it and it was very filling breakfast to start a funfilled day! Thank you for your recipe!
