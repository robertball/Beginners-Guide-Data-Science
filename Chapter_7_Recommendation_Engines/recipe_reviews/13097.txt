This to me is the ultimate "comfort soup"...very rich and creamy.  The rosemary is the key to the wonderful aroma of this soup.  I have made this many, many times and never used to be a big fan of wild rice, but now I am!  I personally changed the recipe by cutting the butter quantity in half (otherwise a lot of the butter ends up floating on the top) and I use 2% and skim milk instead of cream and also I love to add a small can of mushrooms (finely chopped).  If you like creamy soups like "cream of broccoli", you will like this soup.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it several times this fall since discovering it. I tried it "as is" and then made it healthier (couldn't tell the difference) by using 2T butter and fat free half and half. I also added 2-3 cups chopped turkey or chicken, 1/2 tsp crushed dried thyme, 1/2 tsp. crushed dried parsley, fresh ground pepper. Everyone raves when I make this and I've shared the recipe with several people already.

Very good soup.  Using water in which the rice has cooked in the broth makes for a nuttier & wild-ricey-er flavor.  I added 2 chicken breasts (cut up, of course) and I think next time I'd use 2/3 of a cup of wild rice instead of 1/3 of a cup.

This soup was awesome!! I modified it by adding increasing the rice and vegetables and added chopped fresh mushrooms. I reduced the half-and-half and substituted 2% milk and some flour to thicken it just a bit. The family loved it!

My husband can't wait to invite his parents over to show off this recipe.  He thought this was the best soup he has ever had.  I did modify it a little bit by using a can of evaporated milk instead of the cream, plus I added a little thyme.  Very good!  A+

I had been looking for a good wild rice soup recipe and this one is excellent.  You can also use fresh rosemary which works really well also.virginia

Excellent and easy.  I substituted chicken stock for the water and used FAT FREE 1/2 and 1/2 with about 2TBL fresh rosemary.  Next time, I'm adding chicken!

I made this recipe 3 times already, and I don't tire of it! The first time I made it, I followed the indications to the letter. I found that there is too much margarine/butter used for the amount of vegetables. 2 table spoons at most would be fine, or even substitute with olive oil. And I thought that there wasn't enough broth. So adding a cup or two of broth would also help. Thus the 4 stars instead of 5. But if I could, I'd give 4.5 stars. ;)

The 2nd time I made it, I added chicken to the soup, and found that it brings a good soup to a great level. But I thought it was still missing something. So the 3rd time I made it, I added mushrooms. From great to awesome it is!

we felt it lacked a bit of flavor...and the rice was a bit too firm for my liking...the element of chicken was missing and will be added next time...

It was ok the first time...the second time I ramped things up a bit.  I added fresh garlic after the veggies had cooked a bit.  I also added a lot of black pepper and a bay leaf.  I couldn't in good conscience add 1/2 cup of margarine so I added a few tbsp of butter and mixed it in the full amount of flour (no one missed it).  Everyone loved it with the modifications.  Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe... More wild rice needed.  I did substituted 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half for heavy cream... Tasted very good.  I did tweak and added about a cup of mushrooms precooked in butter and 1 clove garlic.  I added 1/4 tsp celery seed and a little more salt.  I had at last ... Mushroom Wild Rice Soup.  Would make again... With mushrooms.

I love, love, love this soup! I used just enough butter (2 Tbsp?)  to saut√© the veggies just to cut down a little on the fat/calories, and added a pound of fresh mushrooms.  This is one of my favorite soups to pull out of the freezer.  Thanks for the recipe!

So awesome!  I just fixed this for my husband on a cold, rainy night & it warmed us right up!  I made a few alterations: used fat free half/half, cut up some chicken tenderloins and placed them in the pot with the cooking rice, used chicken broth to boil rice instead of water, and cut the butter in half.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out to be the perfect base for a turkey soup.  I included three turkey legs (most of meat removed) into the rice cooking water and then transferred them with the rice into broth.  I used a wild rice mix instead of just wild rice, the full 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2, added 1.5 carrots and 2 celery stalks and 1/2 cup of turkey chunks.  My husband was extra complimentary about this recipe.  As other reviewers noted, it is a creamy, soothing soup that is good for a cold night.

Delicious!  I sauteed some mushrooms with the onion and celery.  I also added some white wine.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe.  A wonderful soup for these cool autumn nights.  Add a little salad and some bread and you have a complete meal.

I had a lot of wild rice I had already made and wanted to use it in soup. This recipe is delicious-thanks so much Arlene for sharing it on this site.
I added 4 C. chicken broth to the rice I had already cooked and 2 C. fat free half and half.  I did not add any salt but did add 1/2 t. thyme, 1/4 t. celery seed, 1 t. pepper and 2 T. dried parsley along with the other spices included in the recipe.  It was the best tasting soup I've tried in a long time.

We liked this soup, but serving size is WAY OFF!  There is no way you will get 8 servings as written - unless you are giving everyone just 4 ounces.  I added two cups of shredded chicken and doubled carrots and wild rice and it made 6 bowl size servings. We used 2% milk instead of half and half - turned out yummy.

Oh my gosh, this was great!  My first review after using so many recipes from here - but I just had to, it was that good!  Doubled the carrots and celery, used butter instead of margarine or oil, added 1/3 cup of white rice as well and used cream instead of half and half.  SO tasty!!!  I've been dreaming of a great creamy wild rice soup since I had one many years ago at a deli across from where I worked.  This exceeded my hopes.  I will make again and again!  Thanks for submitting!


Update - have since made several times and added chicken.  Still cannot beat this recipe!!!!  LOVE it!

This was so delicious and easy!! I added some thanksgiving turkey that was left over and yum. The entire family loved it and my hubby asked me if I had made this from a mix I had hidden away. It tasted very high end.  I will add garlic next time and small chunks of potatoes, but that's it. The base is flexible and so so good; thanks for posting!!!

I was excited to find a Wild Rice soup recipe that was super easy but did not have condensed soup in it.  The soup had really nice flavor and was a terrific consistency, but I have to give it low marks for only having 1/3 c of wild rice in it.  I made it on Christmas Eve and after seeing how little rice there was (less than the supporting vegetables by quite a bit) and realizing that most wild rice soup recipes have a 1:4 ratio of rice to water I thought I must have written it down wrong, and we waited another 45 mintues for dinner so I could make a cup of wild rice to add to it.  Then it was perfect.  Since the wild rice is the whole point of the dish, I can't rate it higher than just okay with a 1/3 cup measurement, although everything else about it was terrific, and I am sure I will make it again and again with that one adjustment.
I love fresh rosemary and think I may try throwing a couple of fresh rosemary sprigs in the rice while it cooks and see what kind of flavor it yields over dry.

Yummy! I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut the butter in half, and replaced half of the half-n-half with milk. I realized too late I had no celery, so I used celery seed instead. Added a bit of garlic powder, a little extra rosemary, and I served it with a handful of shredded mozzarella in the bowl. I would definitely make this again!!

This soup was delicious!  I followed the recipe with just a few changes.  I used 1 cup wild rice.  Instead of water, I cooked the wild rice in chicken broth.  I only used a 1/4 cup margarine as suggested by another review.  I used an extra cup of chicken broth.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of the following: parsley, thyme, pepper and red pepper flakes.  Turned out great and will make again for sure.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  Added more rice & chicken, used less butter.  1/2 tsp of parsley 1/2 tsp of thyme, used fat free half-n-half & two stalks of celery and two carrots, only half of a small white onion & some black pepper.  It was fantastic!!  Will definitely make again!

This soup was excellent. I made it for a Superbowl party and everyone had seconds plus wanted some to take home. Highly recommend. I didn't change a thing.

This is a GREAT hearty soup/stew!  I LOVE wild rice soup, and this was the best I've tasted!  I followed some of the suggestions by coking the rice in broth, and doubled the amount of rice.  I also added some bouillion to the broth mixture before adding in the cream.  I also used milk instead of cream.  It was still very thick and creamy!  What a great dinner, and the family really liked it!  Even my picky eater!

Yum!! I also added half a cup of white wine near the end. This just finished it off perfectly.
