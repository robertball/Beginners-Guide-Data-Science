I only made the baba ganoush, and it was DEEEELICIOUS! Not to mention rather easy to make. I can't imagine the hummus being any more difficult to prepare (or eat for that matter).

Very good Baba Ganoush.  I didn't use tahini since I didn't have any, and my family thought the dip was great. I didn't make the hummus.

We took the advice of another reviewer & roasted a head of garlic along with the eggplant.  We added some extra lemon (about a teaspoon) juice to both recipes.
Both recipes were good.

Great recipe! I roasted a bulb of garlic and a red bellpepper together with the eggplant, and used them in the  hummus. i used less tahini (the fat content freaks me out),  and both the hummus and baba ganoush were excellent.

November 2006.  Our family's all time favorite snack ... make up lots and keep on hand at home and work for when hunger strikes.  Add a little feta and olives, too.
