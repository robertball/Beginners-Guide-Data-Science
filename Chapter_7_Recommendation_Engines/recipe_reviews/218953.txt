I did this in my Crockpot. I used a whole pineapple cut up in chunks instead of canned. Next time I will try 2 tbs of brown sugar cook time 5 hours. Delicious!!!!

I used red potatoes and cut the chicken into chunks before baking. We didn't like it very much. It was edible but that was about it. You could spice it up to make it better maybe a citrus/soy sauce? I baked it for 60 minutes instead of 50 and the vegetables were just barely done.

5 stars with minor changes. I loved the ease of a cooking bag. Next time I would try a crock pot. I followed the recipe but added 1 packet of onion soup (left out the spring onions) and added some thyme and basil. I used fresh pineapple. I nuked the cubed potatoes for 1 minute. I baked everything for 40 minutes then turned off the stove and left it in there for a tad about 10 minutes just to make sure the potatoes were done. What a heavenly smell. I will make this again. So many ways to tweet with whatever you have on hand.
