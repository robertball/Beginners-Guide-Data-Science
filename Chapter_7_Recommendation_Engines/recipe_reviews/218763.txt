Tuna melts are a classic and this was a nice take on them.  I used reduced-fat crescents, light cheddar cheese and "Zesty Tuna Salad" from this site which already had pickle relish in the recipe.  The only other thing I added was chopped tomato because what's a tuna melt without tomatoes...  This was easy to put together and made for a nice lunch.  No matter what tuna salad you choose to use it's bound to be tasty!

I made a simple tuna salad from one can drained tuna, mayonnaise, a little chopped celery, onion/garlic powder and pepper. I do not keep dill relish on hand, I added in one chopped garlic dill pickle. The crescent rolls I used were reduced fat. My sons ate all eight. ALL OF THEM. Very simple twist on a sandwich and soup.....when served with a bowl of soup. I loved this because it made dinner so quick and easy and the kids thought it was just fabulous.

Well, I think this missed in a couple areas; the amount of filling to roll, and the sweet flavor of the crescent dough with tuna.  I was looking for a tuna melt sandwich, and I could see that 1/2 cup of salad was very small so I used a cup.  That still turned out to be a very small amount compared to the dough, but you couldn't really fit more filling in a single crescent.  Left out the relish since I had pickles in the tuna salad itself and didn't bother with the egg (which is just for aesthetics).  I think biscuit dough would work much better, the flavor isn't as sweet, and you could make it more like a sandwich by using more filling and folding over.  I almost gave this a 2 star rating, but some might be looking for a roll on the sweet side that has just a hint of tuna.  Personally I wont be using this again.

Excellent recipe, Great Tuna Melt! Thank you Pilisbury! I folded the triangles in half to make them more like a sandwich & I didnt add the pickle relish b/c the Tuna Salad had some in it.  Great success with my 9 yr old son & husband! Thanks Again!

Quick, easy, and good!  The sweet pickle relish goes very well with the slight sweetness of the crescent rolls.  I made a very simple tuna salad with mayo, diced celery, grainy dijon, and pepper.  These are great for lunch!

While trying to assemble, I realized that the recipe didn't give many specifics. I can add and multiply with the best, but I would have preferred it to say 1 Tbsp of tuna per roll. Also, 1/2 C of tuna salad is about the amount you get from one tin of tuna. Pickiness aside, I opted to go with another reviewer's suggestion to make more as a sandwich or hot pocket style. I used two crecent rolls per, stuffed them and ate them. I enjoyed this for a quick weeknight meal and would definitely make it again. I am looking forward to my tuna "sandwich" for lunch tomorrow at lunch too!

For me, the sweetness of the dough conflicted with the tuna salad.  I wasn't impressed, I think this type of dough lends itself to desserts rather than savory.

I was excited about trying these based on the reviews I read.  I have to say though that this recipe really didn't work for my family. The recipe was very easy to put together and baked beautifully in about 14 minutes. However, we thought the sweetness of the crescent roll didn't work with the tuna.   I think it is strictly a case of our own personal taste, because, it seemed that some people liked the contrast of the sweet crescent and salty tuna.  I would not make these again.
