I cut down on the mustard but that left an overpowering ketchup taste. My daughter ate some but she wasn't thrilled with it either.

You really have to be a huge ketchup fan to like this recipe. My wife hated it and she makes the most bland spahetti in the world. My daughter loved it though so that got it the 3rd star.
