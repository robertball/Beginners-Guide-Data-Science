Great rub. Made the full recipe with the scored pork butt, prepared mustard, and rub. Smoked for 11 hours with applewood and the taste was great. I'm not a big fan of the "bark." I know this is sacrilege for bbq but it usually tastes burnt to me. The bark on this pork butt had a wonderful depth of flavor. It had a sweeter taste without the deep char flavor. It really added to the taste of the pulled pork. Recipe note: used paprika, not smoked paprika
