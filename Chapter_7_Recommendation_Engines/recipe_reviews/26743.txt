This was excellent. I cut corners by using chopped clams in a 6.5 oz can.  This made about 14 clams. (I saved the shells from the restaurant, cleaned and boiled them so I could do it this way).  Thanks for the recipe.

Directions are written in a confused way, says to put the bacon on clam and top with butter, but shouldn't it be the other way around?  Whatever.  What I did was fry the bacon in advance and chop it and add it to the butter mixture, I added a pinch of cayenne, and some minced garlic.  so then all I had to do was put the butter mixture on clam and broil. Tastes good no matter what.
