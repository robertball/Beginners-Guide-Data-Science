A real crowd pleaser! Made a few of my own twists though :) also very good as a cinnamon blondie with French vanilla coffee frosting!

These had great flavor, but just a bit too cakey for me.  Personal preference.

11 16 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/232436/mocha-brownies-with-coffee-frosting/ ... Good brownies, better frosting.  These had that funky firm top layer that makes cutting clean pieces almost impossible; okay, impossible.  'Looks like a road after an earthquake.  Good analogy?  Maybe.  Anyway, they taste good; probably a bit less than four stars without frosting; solid four with.  I only added three eggs since there was "chatter" of cakeyness :D.  I was wanting brownies - & I got 'em.  :)  That frosting with another brownie is on my "hit  list."  :o  ;)

The brownie itself needs some work... doesn't have much flavour :( Although the frosting is quite good. I'd give the frosting 5 stars!

I made these in a 7x11 pan which did change cook time, but i started at 30 minutes and checked for consistency every 7 minutes or so. They came out fudgy in the middle, chewy on the outsides, and had a crisp crust on top, i would definitely recommend adding extra coffee for standard instant coffee for a stronger flavor, but they came out absolutely delicious without any added frosting (opted for no frosting on the first go round). I added chocolate chips over the top before i put it in the oven, and it added a really good extra chocolate flavor to them. definitely will be making these again :)

DISCLAIMER: I only made the frosting

I was searching for a mocha or coffee flavored frosting in order to frost the chocolate slow cooker cake (also from this site). It turned out well.  Next time I'll double the ingredients in order to frost the whole cake rather than just the top.

Too sweet and too cakey, but the frosting was delish...although, come to think of it, I had to add about a half of the coffee called for because my brand of instant is very powerful!

found the recipe very easy with no variations, and loved the frosting.  Might try making the icing with Bailey's Irish Cream in place of the dissolved instant coffee crystals next time.  And there WILL be a next time!

These were really good.  I don't know why people thought they were cakey- With the high concentration of fat and lack of leavening, I don't see how they had any choice but to be fudgey.   And they were!  I used a cup of strong coffee in place of the granules and water in the brownies.  I mixed half a cup of baking cocoa to the frosting with the powdered sugar.  I also used strait coffee instead of the granules and milk until it was of spreading consistency, as well as a couple of pinches of salt.

The brownies have a strong coffee flavor and the texture was great!  I did think that the frosting was a little too sweet (but I don't care for many frostings for this reason).

I've made these quite a few times and they are a hit all of the time. Only adjustments I made was to add a little bit more instant coffe to batter and frosting.
