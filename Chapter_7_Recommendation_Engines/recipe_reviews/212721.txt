If I'm going to review a recipe it will only be if I stayed true to the instructions. I can't justify giving a bad review after writing about all the changes I made. Well guess what?  This recipe is freakin great! Every bite was like a party in my mouth. Young and old, everyone enjoyed it. The leftovers were even better the next day. DON'T CHANGE A THING.

Absolutely delicious.  We cut the chicken breasts into large cubes, which worked very well.  Reduced salt by 1 tsp overall.   Highly recommend this recipe.

Great recipe.  I made one big change, though.  Because my husband is from southern India, I cook up a TON of Indian dishes.  To this recipe, I added 11 fresh small green chiles (chopped).  The chiles make it much more authentic and tasteful, especially if you love genuinely spicy food!  Hope this helps!

This always turns out great and gives me a wonderful feeling of satisfaction throughout the experience...be warned though, lay out and measure all the ingredients before turning on the burner!

Outstanding- I no longer need to order out for Indian!  I could not get my hands on garam masala on short notice, but the meal was phenomenal even without it.  Had to use thigh meat because this was a last minute choice and I had no time to run to the store- it was just perfect!

I made this last night and it came out really good.  The one main change I made was that I used boneless chicken breast and thigh meat.  I also cut the meat up prior to cooking.  Other than that, I used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 yogurt.

Great recipe! It was my first time making curry and turned out great! I had to tweak the ingredients a bit due to not having everything available, but still turned out delicious! Fiance went back for seconds, so it was a sure hit.  For my version, I used ground ginger instead of fresh (maybe 1/8 tsp or so) and put it in with the rest of the spices right before simmering. I used dried cilantro flakes instead of fresh. I increased the curry to 1 1/2 Tbsp since we like the curry flavor. I couldn't find any plain yogurt, so I used a mixture of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup coconut milk (with a bit of sugar added). I also used 1/2 cup coconut milk instead of water. For the garam masala I used the 'Easy Garam Masala' recipe found at this website. It makes enough for multiple batches of curry. I also added two potatoes cut into bite-size pieces. This increased the cooking time by about 20-30 minutes, although next time I will add the potato in with the onion to save time. Next time I would also like to try some mushrooms in the curry.  Overall a great recipe, and would make it again and again! Next time will be with shrimp. 5 stars.

This dish was really delicious. I made it for my girlfriend tonight and we both loved it. The gravy was incredibly flavorful, and the dish tasted like something that you would get at a good Indian restaurant.

Very very good and authentic tasting. I put everything, except the lemon and yogurt, in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours. I even threw the chicken in there frozen! After the first 4 hours, I added the yogurt and cooked about another hour. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but next time would do so just before serving.  I used greek yogurt and did not add water or use oil but used twice the amount of crushed tomatoes. I also used only 1 teaspoon of salt, which was plenty. I think the slow cooker method made it very flavorful, moist, healthier and easy.

This was really easy and really tasty. This was my first attempt at a creamy curry and I was very happy.
Only change I made was to mix a tablespoon of flour into the yogurt to keep it from curdling (a tip I read several other places).

This was fabulous!  I added extra a sprinkle of garam masala to the chicken with the salt before cooking it, added a bit of heavy cream with the yogurt and about 1/4 cup of powdered cashews to thicken the curry up.  I also added 1/2 cup of peas when I added the chicken back into the liquid.  It turned out phenomenal!!  I will be making this regularly!!

This was excellent! The changes I made were minimal and, although good, not necessary to create a wonderful dish- used 1/2 cup of yogurt and 1 cup of light coconut milk in place of the 1 cup of yogurt and 1/2 cup of water; one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice in place of the crushed tomatoes, letting them cook with the onion mixture for a couple of minutes prior to adding the yogurt and coconut milk; used 1/2 the amount of cayenne called for to accommodate my kids; and cut the chicken into chunks after browning (in ghee rather than oil). 

I served it with brown rice and roasted, curried cauliflower.

This is the way I like to make curried chicken...leaving the breasts whole and braising slowly in a spicy sauce. I then thinly slice against the grain for the tenderest chicken ever! Great recipe!!!

I totally made this in the slow-cooker and it turned out great! And that made it a little healthier because I didn't use any oil. I just put the chicken in the slow cooker, added the water, then all the ingredients except the oil. I substituted fresh ginger (used powdered) and a garam masala substitute I found online, cause I was out. We are big Indian food fans (we lived there for several years), and this recipe is definitely a keeper. :)

My dad's side of the family is from India, so I have tried many different curries throughout my life.  This was absolutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe as it was written, with the exception of adding potatoes, hard boiled eggs (something we frequently use in curries in my family) and slight amount more yogurt (since I was adding a couple extra bulky ingredients). I noticed that some reviewers commented that this wasn't as authentic as they'd hoped, but who's to say what's authentic anymore?? Curries vary from any area you're in in India, and in the world!!

Really delicious Indian dish.  Here are the small changes I made:  1.  One pound chicken breast cut into bite size pieces. 2.  Added 1 teaspoon powdered ginger (instead of fresh), fenugreek and cardamon to the spice mix.  Used only 1/4 tsp. turmeric due to the strong taste.  Sauteed all the spices in the oil together (including garam masala) along with 1 TBS. vindaloo paste. 2.  Used only 1/2 teaspoon of salt in entire recipe to reduce sodium. 3.  Did not add the 1/2 cup of water. 4.  Used 1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup half-n-half. 5.  Did not use cilantro because I didn't have it. 6.  Added 3 TBS of honey to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. 7.  Added one cup of frozen peas. 8.  Simmered uncovered to make the sauce thicker.  Served this fragrant dish with basmati rice, California medley and naan.  We enjoyed this so much - thanks for the recipe!

I like to try a recipe just the way it is posted before I start making changes or suggestions.  This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried anywhere!! I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful.  I have not found anything this fresh tasting or as good in any Indian Food Restaurant yet, and I love Indian food!  One of the other comments was that this dish was like "A Party in your Mouth" and I have to agree…truely a party in my mouth!  My kitchen still has the wonderful smell of this dish.  I made it last night, which was very good, and we had left overs tonight, which I have to say was even better.  I will make this dish for guests but will make it up the day before and do the sides the day of, just before I serve my guests.  I made batsomi rice and green beans sauted in coconut oil & sea salt for the sides…..yummm.  Party time!
The only thing I will do next time is cut the chicken in smaller pieces so that you don't have to cut up the chicken while eating this tasty dish.  Thank you for sumitting this recipe, any more in your recipe box you want to share????  Cheers

Such an amazing recipe!  We made our own garam masala per a recipe in the comments. This recipe has great flavor and our 6 year old and 3 year old daughters both LOVE it.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Tastes just like a restaurant dish!  I cut the chicken in cubes, instead of leaving the breast halves in one piece.  Used 1/4 c. oil, no more.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used diced and the juice.  Couldn't find an 8 oz. cup of plain yogurt in the store, they are all 6 oz. now, so I added some sour cream to balance it out.  Used dried cilantro.......1 and 1/2 tsp. total.  Also added some cut up cooked potatoes and green pepper. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

Very good, however, do not bring to a boil as the recipe states, as it breaks the yoghurt. I should have known better... The chicken will still cook at a medium heat.

AMAZING!  will cut back the cayenne by about half next time, I like spicy but its really spicy!   Be careful not to over cook the chicken and would be good with chicken cut into bite sized pieces and then serve over rice, and maybe side of stir fry veggies.

Very good! So simple and easy. My thought though is to make sure you don't over add the tomato, other wise that's all you'll taste.

Seemed a little bland to me...  I put in less cayenne since this was for a dinner party with people that have varying tolerances to spice.  It worked really well to satisfy alot of differnt people but I don't think I would make it for myself at home.

I have made this recipe many times and in finalizing it for our family here are the changes i made. I replaced the 1 cup yogurt with 1/2 cup coconut milk, replaced the diced tomato's with 2 cans of 8oz tomato sauce. I squeeze in 2 tablespoons of lemon. Then final adjustment is 1 1/2 tablespoon of shan curry powder.

I have a friend in college who grew up in India. His mom made this dish often. I learned from her the order of ingredients is important.

I heated the oil, added the spices and brought it to a simmer. Then I added the onions (and some more oil as needed) When the onions were almost done, I added the garlic. Then I added the water and tomatoes and brought it to another simmer. Finally I added purred ricotta cheese (which I substituted for the sour cream) and topped the whole thing off with the chicken. I put it in the oven for about 25 minutes, checked the temp of the inside of the thickest piece and then put it on top of fresh cooked rice. It was AMAZING.

This is an excellent recipe! My only complaint is that the instructions should be separated out so that there are about 15 steps instead of 4. The long paragraphs made it easy to get lost. I solved this by retyping it into a Microsoft Word document for next time. I'll definitely be making this one again! Thanks for sharing it!

This turned out very tasty!  I didn't use 1/2 cup oil and instead used only a few tablespoons which was all that was needed.  I loved the flavor that the yogurt lended to the dish.  Thanks for an easy Indian recipe!

This was excellent. The only this I changed was that I cut up the chicken prior to browning and and added a pinch of black pepper. It didn't need anything else--it was outstanding. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic. I've been looking for a decent curry for ages and finally found it. I would recommend two things with this to make it even better.  First, skip the salt, people use it too much as it is. Second, uncover it near the end and let it cook out some of the liquid. It ended up being a bit soupy, even on rice.

I followed this recipe almost exactly (only change I made was coconut milk instead of yogurt, worked great), and it is fabulous!  It tastes very authentic, as least in terms of what I usually get in Indian restaurants, and it was not difficult at all.  I will definitely be making this again, maybe adding some veggies or using a different protein, but this is definitely one of the better curry recipes I have made.

It was divine! I had to adapt my spices to what was available where I live, so I skipped the turmeric, used grated ginger instead of fresh, dried cilantro instead of fresh and made my own garam masala mixture. The house smelled amazing while making it, and everyone loved the final product! Thanks for sharing!

this is just like the chicken curry my friend Margaret from Sri Lanka used to make!  I have been looking for a similar recipe for years; this is easy & delicious.  It tastes better the next day, reheated.  Serve over rice.  I was out of plain yogurt today and used sour cream, couldn't tell any difference!  I also leave out the cilantro, because I don't like it.  Wonderful comfort food!

This was very good and we will make again. The only thing I would change next time is to make the sauce thicker. I would skip the added water. And I would not cover the dish so that the sauce thickens up.

Unbelievably delicious and, I thought, pretty.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so at the last minute I substituted chipotle pepper, and it was wonderful.  Also did not have garam masala, but the dish was absolutely amazing even without it.  This is definitely joining my regular repertoire of dishes.

Very tasty!! I cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and sautéed them in coconut oil and they ended up tender and juicy. I used plain Greek yogurt.  I added more curry later than when it called, I'm not sure but because of this it made the curry a little powdery. Only down side. I also added Sriracha (who doesn't put Sriracha on everything).  I forgot the lemon juice but I added a cilantro mango salsa (fresh mango, fresh cilantro, a little cinnamon, fresh ginger, and a few other spices) and it was perfect! Every bite was different! Served it over rice and sautéed kale. Very yummy and healthy!

As is this recipes is ok but with a little tweaking this recipe has become my baby. Use about 7 chicken breast and instead of leaving the chicken breast whole, cut them into 1 inch cubed pieces and only use 1 teaspoon to season the chicken. Puree the ginger, onion and garlic (you can use 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder if you don't have it fresh) so that you can make a sauce. If you don't like the recipe too spicy cut down the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon and instead of using canned crushed tomatoes, use 1 can 8oz of tomato sauce and 3-4 tomatoes and chop them into 1 inch pieces. Substitute the yogurt for sour cream and serve with white rice. I assure you this will become a staple at your home.

Great recipe! I have been making it for a long time now and it always goes great. I decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/4 of a teaspoon. I also made my own garam masala and it tastes great.You can also substitute the yogurt for sour cream which I find tastes better.

this is a great recipe for curry, and i liked the fact that the ingredients were listed by the order of use throughout the cooking.
I made a few adjustments- to the dry spices, i added yellow curry paste, i used vegetable stick instead of water (simply because i had some from yesterday), and used coconut milk and not yogurt.
Loved the final result as well as the fact that it can be easily tweaked, to what you have in your pantry

My mouth is watering just thinking about making this again. The taste is so authentic. I impressed my ex sister in law who is from India. she was blown away. The only thing i did not like was that the yogurt became kinda grainy. Im not sure how to fix that. If anyone has any suggestions on how to make it smooth, id like to hear it. But im still giving it a 5 ++++ because the taste was amazing.

This was my first try at making and my first taste of Indian food!  I thought is was very tasty.  My kids thought it was a little too spicy so next time I'll reduce the cayenne.  I cut my chicken breasts into small pieces and browned them instead of using the whole breasts.  My only problem was that my yogurt separated.  I had only 0% fat Greek yogurt on hand so maybe the fat free thing did it.  Maybe next time I'll stir the yogurt in at the last minute just letting it heat through but not simmer.  Thanks for helping me try Indian food.  I liked that I was able to buy just the small amounts of the spices at our local healthy market and didn't have to buy jars of it.

Tasty! Easy to make. It could use some tweaking. In the future we will substitute chicken for lamb (our favorite); and use 1.5 lbs. instead of 2 lbs. of meat. This will give us more sauce. The way the recipe was designed makes the dish rather dry when served on a bed of basmati rice. Still very tasty. We might also add a few potatoes (just b/c we love them). Worthy of a special occassion. You won't regret making it. Also, I would add more cayenne pepper; we like our food spicier.

Absolutely fantastic! I had a dinner party and I was praying this recipe would live up to the reviews. It went above and beyond my expectations. We have no good Indian restaurants in town so I will be making this again! It went fabulously with the Naan recipe by Mic.

I prepared this with lamb instead of chicken.  5 stars without a doubt.  A must try for anyone who is familiar with, or after, authentic Indian curry.  Thanks for posting.

I have made this several times and my family loves it! I put in 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and use 4 fresh chopped garlic cloves instead of what is listed.  Also, I reduce oil to 1/4 of a cup using grapeseed oil.  Love it!

This was delicious!  Me and my three friends all loved it.  So flavorful!  The only thing I changed was to add a bit less cayenne pepper since I don't like spicy foods.  Even then it had a hint of spice but enough that I could handle it.  Will make again!

Excellent dinner. My wife does not like spicy foods so I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and it turned out perfect. I also cubed the chicken breast before cooking. This made it much easier to serve over rice. We have made this recipe many times. It feeds about 4-5 people. Very good!

This was very good.  I made a few minor changes based on other curries I have made.   1) I "bloomed" the spices in a little hot oil before adding the onions, garlic, and ginger.  2) I cubed the chicken before adding it back to the rest of the recipe.  3) Because I love lemon grass and grow it,  I added that with the onions 4) I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to balance the tart flavors, 5) and lastly because i have an abundance of zucchinni in my garden, i added that just before the onions were done - they were a great addition.

This was awesome!  I made it exactly as stated but left out the cayenne because I was not feeling well and didn't want all the spice.  Without the cayenne it was still great and had a nice amount of spice!  Tasted very authentic and was one of the best Indian dishes I have made thus far.  It got rave reviews from everyone!  Served over quinoa for me and brown rice for everyone else, with a side of sauted spinach.  This hit the spot for my Indian craving! :)

We had indian food for the first time on vacation at an all inclusive resort, we were blown away by how good it was and as soon as we got back searched for a recipe for what we had. This was it and it was just as good as the restauarant we ate at. We didn't have garam masala but used extra curry instead after a short google search. I like things a little hotter so I added 1/2 tbsp crushed red pepper and it was the perfect amount for me.

Okay. Liked the sound of the ingredients, so decided to give it a go. Cut the chicken into one-inch pieces. Used much less oil, maybe 1 tb., and added garlic after the onions, so as not to burn. We like sauce, so used a bit more of the spices called for, big can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and some tomato paste to make it less watery. Also added cauliflower flowerettes. Lovely. Sorry to not adhere to recipe posted, but I kinda do my own thing.

Bland, bland and bland. It wasn't creamy, it wasn't sweet, it wasn't oily. In my experience eating at many authentic Indian restaurants (I live in Toronto) and tasting dishes prepared by Indian friends, this was flavourless with the exception of a strong paprika taste. I don't understand why this has such high reviews.

It's missing something, or a couple things. Possibly milk or cream, coconut milk, sugar or something else. But I was so bored by this recipe that I'm not going to try to improve it. It was also messy. The half cup of oil on med-high heat splattered everywhere.

Lovely flavor and easy to control the amount of spice just with how much cayenne you add. This recipe has a lot of ingredients, so it's not something you just whip up, but it is easy and worth the time. I will make it again.

My tweaks:  subbed out half of the yogurt for coconut milk, less cayenne (I have very low spice tolerance), less salt ('cause you can always add more later), halved the tomato amount and I added peas.

Love this!  I put all the spices in at the same time after the onion/garlic/ginger has cooked for while. I think cooking the spices this way really brings out the flavor. I just put the chicken in towards the end and let it poach in the sauce then add the yogurt at the very end to warm through. Sometimes it needs some thickening with a cornstarch/water paste. YUMMY!

I've tried this recipe many times now.  We love it!  First few times I added the yoghurt when the recipe said.  DON'T DO THAT!  It curdles and doesn't look nice at all.  Add the yoghurt at the very end and stir it in when you've taken the curry off the heat.  It tastes better and looks better!  Don't need lemon either.

I've eaten curry...  I mean like real curry from India.  This was great! I would scale back the ginger a *tiny* bit, but this was perfect.  I chickened out, and put a little less cayenne in...  Don't.  This recipe, besides lowering the ginger by just a hair, is what I would say is a great Indian curry.  Don't change it.  I can't say enough about it...

VERY SPICY! I cut the cayenne in half and it was still very hot. Tasty overall, but would benefit from some coconut milk or more yogurt.

This recipe was fantastic! I followed the directions exactly, except I did not use any cilantro. I let the chicken continue to simmer in the curry until it was tender enough to fork shread. I served with Naan bread and toasted pine nut cous cous. It was better than any curry I have ever had at a restaurant. I ver highly recommend!

This curry seemed like a winner.  I'm looking for that sumptuous to-die-for curry that you can only get in really good indian restaurants.  As itnwas cooking, I thought I finally had it.  The first few bites were good then that tomato tang took over and I felt like I was eating spicy Italian food.  I don't know what the secret to Indian food is but some day I hope to find it.

Absolutely excellent.  I'm an amateur cook at best and this still turned out restaurant quality.  Every bit a match to what I get for $20 from Indian food places.

Next time I might use chili powder instead of cayenne, and maybe double the amount just because I like my mouth on fire.  But delicious regardless.

I really enjoyed this recipes. I am constantly trying out different curry recipes and this one was easy to make and tastes great. I did add quite a bit more cayenne pepper, but that is just to suit our taste. I definitely agree with the reviewer who suggested measuring out everything before you start. It comes together very quickly!

So good!  This is the best curry recipe I've tried.  I didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes, so I added tomatoe sauce & it was fine.  Served with rice, & naan - completely delish!

This is amazing. Even better the next day! And once you have all of the spices it is pretty cheap to make. Great with rice and homemade naam. Will be making this again tonight.

My husband loved this! Very spicy - both of us were drinking water like it was going out of style.  I forgot to buy the coriander, but did have the garam masala - still delicious without the coriander!

This is a great tasting curry dish. I made it with only a couple of substitutions for ingredients I didn't have, will make again and again. I substituted light sour cream for yogurt, added some fresh cauliflower florets because I had them in the refrigerator, also added a few frozen peas for color. I used bottled garlic chili sauce for cayenne pepper. I also let it cook for almost an hour on low simmer to let the flavors blend. I will also try sambal oleck for heat next time. A great recipe, will make just as written and also great to improvise. Served with brown basmati rice. Great!

I loved this recipe. I'm a huge Indian food fan and I thought this was very authentic. The only change I would make next time (I followed the recipe exactly) is to cut the cayenne pepper by 1/2. Right after I added the amount I thought "wow this is too much" and it was. I want to taste the flavor of the food and this was just slightly over the top. Imagine how hot it was the next day! But you won't be sorry - this is a GREAT recipe!

I have now made this recipe three times. The first time I stayed true to the recipe. The result was very good. But, I have found that I prefer the dish with bone in chicken and fresh Romas. The bone in chicken is succulent and the stewed down fresh tomatoes add a pleasant texture compared to the canned tomatoes. I served the chicken with a simple basmati pilaf. I anticipate, as slightly amended, this recipe will join our regular rotation.

I love this recipe and make it all the time!  I dropped it one star because it does need some minor tweaks.  I use half the recommended oil and leave out the lemon juice.  If you use the recommended oil it’s just a little too much and it’s overkill, I’ve found its much better when the oil is reduced by half.  I also omit the lemon juice as I find that it makes the sauce too tart.  That’s it for the tweaks.  I use the full amount of cayenne as I like mine really spicy, but I could see it being too much for some, so that could be reduced by half as well if your not a super spicy fan (you will still have some heat).  Here is a great tip to prevent the yogurt from curdling/separating:  Use full fat yogurt (I use Fage Greek total 5%), add I teaspoon of corn starch or flour to the yogurt, then temper it by adding a little of the warm sauce to the yogurt to bring the temp of the yogurt up, then add the yogurt to the sauce/dish, mix in slowly and make sure the temperature isn’t too hot.  Now and days when I make this dish, I double the sauce/ingredients but keep the protein at 2lbs, that way I have tons of sauce/gravy for dipping my naan bread in!  If you follow my minor tweaks and yogurt suggestions you won’t be disappointed, as this is truly a delicious recipe!

I just finished eating this and I found it to be okay. Not bad but not great either and certainly a far cry from what I had expected based on all of the rave reviews. The spices didn't really come together to add depth of flavour to the dish. Instead the predominant taste was equal parts heat and tanginess with a strong, almost overpowering, undercurrent of the coriander. I'm not quite sure what it's missing to bring it together - maybe some coconut milk. It was interesting to try but I won't make it again.

THIS IS SO GOOD. I am in love with this recipe. I have made it twice in the span of a week and a half, both times it turned out absolutely delicious. I will definitely be saving this recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty exact except for a few minor things: 

I did about half the amount cayenne because I'm a wuss. The bite is very mild.
Used a simple recipe for scratch Garam Masala since I could not find any at the store. Used all the same spices + cardamom. 

Added zucchini and garbanzo beans. 

Served with brown rice first time and lentil wild rice mix the second.  

All of the above worked out super yummy.

The base recipe was good, but needed an extra kick to make it great for our family. It was a bit too bland, so I tripled the amount of curry powder, and doubled all the other spices. Next time I think I will make it 4T of curry.  Our family loves an intense curry flavor. I also substituted the 1/2c water for coconut milk, which added a richness to the sauce.

This stuff is awesome! The best Indian food I have ever made. I used canned tomato sauce instead of tomatoes for a smoother texture. The yogurt, tomato sauce, and spices make a wonderfully delicious orange sauce, which is perfectly spiced - not too spicy, but very savory. This also warms up well for leftovers.

So ON POINT! Will be making this again and again. I added about 10 red chili peppers (chopped) in with the onions and sautéed those alone. Mashed up ginger and fresh turmeric with the spices in a mortar and added that after the onion/peppers were ready. Other than that made the rest per the recipe. However, I should've doubled the recipe because we tore that UP and now it's all gone. I'm tempted to make some more tomorrow because I only had one plate- family devoured it. Served with jasmine rice and sautéed spinach. Perfect. May use shrimp next time. May add fresh thyme. May toss in some coconut milk. But this base recipe will remain my go to from here on out ???? THANK YOU for sharing this deliciousness!

This is absolutely one of my all time favorites from Allrecipes.com  The only thing I do differently is that I cut the chicken into strips instead of leaving them whole, other than that I follow the recipe as is.  I love Indian food, and this is just so good! Always a hit with the family!

My husband loved this dish! The only thing I changed, I used cumin seed as I didn't have ground cumin. I put the cumin seed in with the onion to release the flavour. Will make this again.

I made this exactly as written aside from cutting the amount of cayenne in half so my kids would eat it. None of us loved it, none of us thought it was terrible. I feel like it needs to be creamier, less tomato-y. I really like the combination of spices in the sauce, it just lacked the "depth" needed to make this something I'd want to make over and over. I see that several reviewers suggested adding coconut milk, so I'll try that next time.

I made this last night and my husband "LOVED" it.  This will be made again and again in my house.  The only adjustment I made to this recipe is I cut the salt and pepper in half and only put a quarter cup of oil.

Tastes as good as anything I've ever gotten at the Indian restaurants. Just the right amount of spice! Substituted the chicken with cauliflower, chickpeas and red potatoes and added green peas at the end. Put this over the "Indian Style Basmati Rice" recipe from this website. I will definitely be making this again. Might try substituting coconut milk for the yogurt next time.

This was Uber tasty! I skipped the cilantro and lemon juice out of laziness and it was still fantastic. It had a nice warmth to it as you eat it, but could use more spice if that's what you want. Will be making again.

Made this last night--yes, following recipe--in a cast-iron fry pan and it was quite good. Quibble: I LOVE acidic things, but lemon juice seemed to take things too far. (Did I reduce my sauce too much?) TASTE before adding lemon juice! If you have probe thermometer, check temp 10-15 mins from when you put chicken back in. I cooked mine for 25 with front gas burner on lowest setting and my chicken got to 205 F which made is a bit "tough" (for chicken). Overall, quite easy for an Indian curry and I'll be making it again.

I REALLY loved this recipe...  I prefer chicken thighs though.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut them into bite sized pieces before making the recipe.

Yum! This dish was easy and so full of flavor! The only thing I changed was using 2tb butter in place of the 1/2c of oil. That reduced some of the calories and added a little extra flavor. My yogurt curdled slightly even though I warmed it up with some of the sauce before adding it. I noticed that I accidentally bought low-fat instead of full-fat so I think that contributed to the curdling. Also, I saw online that you can add corn starch to yogurt to stabilize it before adding it to hot sauces- I will try that next time. But this dish tasted amazing despite the slight curdle and it was even better the next day!

This is so good!  I hate when people change the recipe and then write a review...but that's exactly what I ended up doing.  :(  I used coconut milk in place of water, I didn't use garam masala because I didn't have it, and I added a tablespoon of honey to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.  I tasted as I went, and this was awesome even without the honey, but a little bitter.  Once I added the honey, it was perfection.  Also, I cooked the spices in the oil to help bloom the flavors.  But honestly, this recipe is awesome and very versatile.  The amount of spice was just right.  This is a keeper folks!  Even my picky teenager loved this dish.

Oh my goodness.. I made a couple changes due to missing ingredients, but turned out awesome! I'm a cultural food guru, have traveled all over the world - I know good food and this recipe was great. Here is what I did: I used a half chicken in one piece and fried it on both sides almost all the way through. I followed the recipe for the most part, but substituted yogurt with unsweetened coconut milk. I also changed all the water ingredients to chicken broth, the cayenne pepper for whole dried chipotle chiles which I finely chopped, and I had to make my own garam masala with 1/4 tsp each of cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, and turmeric. I then simmered abt 40 mins until the chicken almost fell off the bone, and served it over rice mixed with green onions and pine nuts. What a treat, so gooooood. This is a new fave:)

I have made numerous dishes from recipes I found online, and have never been as pleased with the results as this one!  In fact, I've never reviewed a recipe, but felt this was so tasty, it deserves one!  The quality was similar to that in an Indian restaurant!  Since EVERYONE in my family loved this dish, I will be sure to make it again!

This was a giant hit with my family. I'm new to making Indian food and this was a great starter recipe - not too difficult but packed with flavor. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts as that's what I had on hand, and I'll probably use thighs in the future with this recipe. Thanks for posting. It's going in my recipe box.

Great curry. I appreciate that the recipe uses yogurt rather than coconut milk. I love coconut milk but it is too rich. I used non-fat plain yogurt and it tasted great.

This dish was excellent. I live in a small town near the Canadian border so we have no Indian food places around here. I had some Indian food on a trip to D.C. and fell in love. I have tried to recreate this dish many times. Then I ran across this recipe and couldn't believe how great this was. It tasted just like the dish I had in D.C. This one is in my recipe box under awesome!

Very good! My husband raved about it and said it is one of his favorite dishes. The only change I made was I only had a little bit of yogurt so I also added some sour cream. Delicious!

Made this recipe exactly as written.  I used full-fat yogurt.  It had just the right amount of spice but it was very tomato-y.  I will be cutting the tomato by half next time I make it.  There was more sauce than we could eat so I don't expect to add anything extra to make up for less tomato.

Wow! This recipe is fantastic and full of flavor! Just what I would expect for Indian cuisine. My husband even said that he would pay for this dish at a restaurant (I consider that high praise). I followed the recipe to the letter. Delicious!

Wow, love it. The house smells great, music is playing, everyone happy. Add Basmati rice and it's all good. Couple personal changes to make it WOW with the family. Use coconut oil to brown the chicken and the veggies, great aroma not over powering, use less oil, add flour to the yogurt to prevent yogurt from curdling, add 1 tablespoon brown sugar to counter to tomatos, let it simmer for good 1/2hr till it thickens, add more water if needed. That's how you get flavor out of any sauce really, add liquid and keep reducing. Cut up chicken before browning to bite size pieces. End result. Chicken felt apart, rice took all the sauce, you did good, really good. Wife said and I quote " I am going upstairs to get away from this, after having a sip of the broth at 10PM :)

This is something I make quite often in my home. You can vary ingredients and spices, but it always turn out great. You don't have to use half cup of oil though. I only use a few table spoons of oil and it's plenty yummy!!!

This had great flavor. I made only a couple of changes and cut back on the oil and salt a bit. I did find that it was pretty watery for my taste, so I added some cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. We enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great curry recipe. The only thing I would add and I can't believe any great sauce' specialist would leave this out of an outstanding curry sauce is: instead of a 1/2 cup of water, substitute with a 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Coconut milk is always a must in almost any curry dish.

Oh my word!  This is sooooo good!  I don't think I've ever taken the time to write a review before but I just had to for this recipe.  Husband and I love this meal and had no problem finding the spices.  I often forget to add the garam masala and it's still super good.  The only negative is how the house smells like curry for a couple days, LOL.  The only changes I made were to add sliced bell pepper and frozen peas recently to get in some veggies.  There's plenty of sauce to handle the additions. Thanks to this recipe I can enjoy Indian food any time I want!

There are a million chicken curry recipes out there, and this one is one of my favorites. Everyone in my family loves this dish including my grandma who passed away.  I was actually jumping up and down with excitement when I found this one today because my entire recipe collection was wiped out 3 1/2 years ago by an angry ex, I had replaced all my recipes but this one, the last and final missing recipe is back and I have to make this week I'm so excited!!!

SO GOOD, nice and spicy, tasted just like at a restaurant! I followed recipe exactly, except instead of yogurt I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c milk. I cut 2 chicken breasts into cubes and cooked in a skillet. I also made Naan to go with it using recipe from this site! Awesome thank you!

We really liked this.  For my family it was a good balance of the creamy-spicy and not too tomato-y. I reduced the tumeric a little because we'd had a dish the night before with way too much and it can be an overpowering spice.  Next time I might reduce the tomotoes since I prefer it a little creamier.

This recipe is great!  My first foray into Indian cooking & it was a smashing success! :-)  The only modification that I made was cutting the cayenne pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon.  Even that was too spicy for my kids(ages 9, 7, 5, 4) who are actually quite accustomed to spicy food.  They all liked the dish overall though, which hardly ever happens. They just downed 1/2 gal. of milk with their dinner ;-}

I was looking for a recipe to use up some mango yogurt that I was in the midst of making when I broke the blender (so the mixture was just frozen yogurt, a little milk, nonfat yogurt, and a 1/4 t of splenda).  I found this and felt that the recipe was amenable enough for this alteration.  It turned out pretty yummy (though the mango flavor did not really show through).  I did not have any canned diced tomatoes, so I simply diced up some fresh ones.  (I felt that the mango yogurt provided enough liquid for the entire recipe).  And since I like myself some dark meat, I used chicken drumsticks only.  I recommend this recipe, since it is so simple to make with such great results.

This is a good recipe, however, I prefer the Thai Pineapple Chicken Curry recipe on this site better. :)

The first recipe from the internet that I hardly had to modify, and it was a great hit as is.  Good instructions, great results.  I wish all recipes were this reliable.  Spice can easily be adjusted.  I used a good quality Madras curry.

I don't usually rate recipes, but this was excellent and fairly easy to make! I made it with basmati rice and added half a can of coconut milk. I think this would be good with shrimp also!

Excellent curry recipe! I made a few modifications, but pretty much followed this recipe to a T. I added some diced potatoes and peas along with the chicken and water. I also skipped the lemon because the crushed tomatoes already give the dish enough acidity.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is, although I did reduce the amount of cayenne for my mom's sake. In addition, I added some sliced zucchini towards the end, as well as some frozen peas. Definitely a recipe I'll be making again.

I think that I was expecting too much from this recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written, but didn't find it very authentic. Maybe I'm not a good enough cook but I wanted to have a dish for when the Indian buffet wasn't open. I guess I'll have to keep looking.

Very very good! The only thing we did differently was we used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes because we didn't have any and we didn't put as much water in it as called for as we prefer thicker curries. But we would definitely use crushed tomatoes next time and stuck with the less liquid. We had this with Chappati and it was great and authentic tasting! Thanks for the recipe!! We enjoyed it tremendously.

This is only the second Indian dish I've ever made, and it turned out great. I'm quite a chaotic cook - in that I follow the recipe until about halfway through and then start freaking out and throwing stuff in the pot - and it would have turned out better if I had followed the recipe to a T instead of throwing extra spices in at the last minute. The only problems I ran into were probably my own doing - my onions and garlic burned long before the 8-minute mark, I used too much oil, which meant I was scooping it out of the bottom of the pan in big spoonfuls before serving, I used too much yogurt (more like 1.5 cups) in an attempt to make more sauce (which ended up making it a bit too bitter and yogurt-y), and I boiled instead of simmered, which made my pan quite ugly. No garam masala or coriander,  so I threw in some ground cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Didn't have jasmine rice, but worked great with rice. The parents loved it!

This chicken curry is by far the best recipe I have found (and I have tried many!)  Indian is my favorite cuisine and I often find it difficult to get all the spices just right but this recipe creates the perfect combination.  I served it to my family of adventurous eaters and everyone LOVED it.  They all thought it was authentic and restaurant quality.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I try to make it every 2 weeks!  :)

This turned out spicy and delicious.  Changed things up a little bit - cut the chicken into cubes and after cooking the garlic, onion, ginger, added the spices and then the chicken to brown.  Then I added in the tomatoes and yogurt, but skipped the 1/2 cup water.  Simmered on low heat, uncovered, for about 30 minutes.  Sauce turned out great.  Also added some garbanzo beans and they worked great.  Served over rice - can't wait to make again.  Thanks!

So good! I've made it twice now. The first time I made it exactly as per recipe. It was wonderful, and the spice ratios were perfect. I PERSONALLY wanted more heat, but that's just me being a hothead. The boyfriend thought it was perfect, so I was voted down on adding more cayenne.

 The 2nd time I wanted to stretch it further so we'd have more leftovers for lunches, so I used 1.5 times the spices, 20oz crushed tomatoes, a few handfuls of frozen/sliced okra, and some zucchini. I also noticed that my nonfat plain yogurt separated (I'm sure you were SUPPOSED to use full-fat, I just never have it in the house) the first time, so I replaced it with a few tablespoons of cream cheese. Weird and not authentic, I know. But it cooled it and added creaminess, so it worked. I would have left it out entirely if it were up to me, but the bf was worried it would be too spicy for him without dairy. And it WAS delicious that way. 

Both times, it was fantastic. I will note that I didn't have garam masala either time, but I knew from somewhere it was a mixture of spices that were already in the curry, plus cinnamon and black pepper... so I just added a bit of those in the last few minutes.

Really, really good. I diced my chicken and didn't have any garam masala, but regardless, this was just delicious. To go along with it, I made some mint yogurt, pita bread, and served over rice.

My family loves this recipe. I recently taught one of my childrens friends to make it (who could not cook unless it was from a box) it turned out wonderful because it is such an easy recipe anyone can make it. I add 3 hot peppers to mine though for an extra kick. This recipe will warm you up but not cause you to break a sweat. A must try!!!

Loved this recipe!  We cut our chicken into large chunks as a previous reviewer had mentioned to do.  I also cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit simply because of our kids, but it still had great flavor!

I used other chicken parts such as drumsticks and thighs and it was very tasting - of course, longer cooking time compared to the breasts. I didn't have masala and lemon juice but it still worked wonderfully. I used coconut milk instead of yogurt and it still very good. The spices are not that very difficult to find. I highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was fantastic.  It was the first Indian dish my wife has ever had and she loved it!  Seemed like a lot of oil though.  Next time (there will for sure be a next time) I will cut the oil in half...

My boyfriend and I made this dish for a Valentine's day dinner - it was amazing! We like a lot of veggies, so we added potatoes, green peppers and mushrooms to the dish. It was delicious with the addition!! We put the potatoes and green peppers in five minutes after the onions because they would take longer to cook. Then we added the mushrooms after adding the chicken the second time. Since we added more veggies we put a little extra of each seasoning in it as well.  When the curry had cooked for 20 minutes it was still quite water - maybe because of the extra veggies - so we made a cornstarch rue and added that - it turned out perfectly! Thank you so much for the great recipe!!

This was my first attempt at an Indian dish and it was great!  Easy to make and very similar to the chicken curry at our local Indian restaurant.  Served it with basmati rice and naan - yum.  This is a keeper.

Delicious!  No garam masala, would use less oil next time (only used 3 thin chicken breasts, not 2 lbs)

This was wonderful. If you dont have the spices already this could be pretty pricey the first time around. I had some leftover leeks in the fridge and they did great in it too. Nice and spicy just the way I (and apparently everyone else) like it!

I made only a few changes: - I omitted the cilantro (didn't have it, don't care for it that much). - I added chopped red pepper in with the onion - I used sour cream instead of yogurt because I didn't have yogurt   Other than that, this was an amazing dish! The color, the texture, and flavor were all wonderful and I have already gone and bookmarked this to make again. Thank you for sharing this!

My boyfriend raved about this dish. I skewed it a little in order to work with what I had in the kitchen. But it was great. However, I wish it had more color and presented better. That was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

We loved this recipe. We didn't have all of the spices and it still turned out really yummy! I would change one thing though, I would add less yogurt next time because I like things a little more on the spicy side. I also cut the chicken in cubes and then coated it with a cornstarch and egg white mixture (2 TBS cornstarch and 2 eggwhites) before I put it in the oil. It made the chicken a little crispy! Anyway, thank you for this recipe. I loved it!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, and it was delicious! The sauce did curdle a bit, but I think that affected the appearance and not the flavor. I steamed some fresh broccoli by adding it to the pan during the final 20 minutes of cooking and served the chicken and broccoli over jasmine rice, topped with a generous scoop of sauce. I didn’t have fresh cilantro, so I used dried, though I don’t think dried cilantro tastes anything like fresh. I forgot the lemon juice, and we didn’t miss it, but I’ll try that when we eat the leftovers.

I made this wonderful dish with a few adjustments. I am also following a Weight Watchers diet and this dish is 2 points per serving. I used 5 large fresh organic tomatoes, I also used 4 small onions which I blended along with 12 garlic cloves and about 3 inches of garlic and 4 small thai green chili’s. I like my curry spicy. I also cooked mine in a crockpot / pressure cooker. I added about a quarter extra seasonings because I like a little extra sauce.

Very simple and clean plate club attendee. Doubled up on the garlic, used unsweetened coconut yogurt and seasoned the chicken as well. Would cook this recipe again!

Liked this very much - had an adventure making something I haven’t had in decades - never tried making it... even made my own garam masala... easy dish and the flavors are just as I remember... followed the recipe to the letter except I used 1/4 cup of oil instead of a half cup... that’s it... will make it again for sure...

Delicious!! You don’t need to change a thing about this recipe. The only ingredient I skipped was cilantro because I swear I thought I had some but I didn’t. I’m sure we missed out on flavor and we definitely missed out on the color. Other than that I cut the breasts into chunks because it’s easier to portion out and I blended the sauce because I wanted to be able to serve it over rice without chunks of onion. Neither were necessary changes though. I will definitely make it again.

Okay...kinda bland. I tried it a second time adjusting the spices based on some of the other reviews. It was better but lacked smokiness, heat, and texture I'm looking for.

Before adding the curry powder, turmeric and cumin, I heated them up for a few minutes in a small frying pan stirring constantly until the curry powder turned a darker shade of brown. I read on a different curry recipe that it releases the flavours and aroma. Other than that, followed the instructions and hoped it tasted great. It did. Will definitely make again.

We loved it. It was delicious.

The one change I made: No cilantro/coriander because we both think it tastes like dish soap. I know people love it but if you are in the 10% that don't, this is a really yummy without.

This was fantastic. I made only minor changes based on ingredients i had/didn't have and to increase the chili heat. I substituted boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breast for preference, and annatto for turmeric and tomato puree for crushed tomatoes since I had them on hand. I also added about a teaspoon of datil pepper powder in addition to the cayenne to up the chili heat. I would estimate it came out to about an 8 of a 1-10 Indian restaurant "hot scale." I served it over saffron rice.

This is packed with so much flavor. I made sure to use all organic ingredients and although I’m not from India, I have had curries at many different restaurants and even been cooked for authentically by indian friends and I can say it stands up to the flavors of the traditions I’ve experienced. Good job!

I made this dish without the yogurt to accommodate someone with a dairy allergy and it was still delicious! I am excited to try it again with yogurt next time. It was slightly spicy and easy to make!

I loved this dish. Instructions were easy to follow and the dish was easy to make. Will definitely be making it again. Might add potatoes, carrots, and Serrano Peppers to add more depth to the dish.

Unable to edit my previous review, so leaving another. Still delicious flavor and just the right amount of heat (about like chili.) I would use only half the amount of oil next time and would not put in the 1/2 cup of water, as I like a thicker sauce. Prepping ingredients beforehand necessary for faster cook time.

Has good spice and that's about it. Very tomato flavored and lacks any good curry flavor even following the steps. Won't be trying this recipe again.

I've made this recipe several times over the pass few years and never got around to writing a review. At times, I've substituted the fresh ginger for dry or the yogurt with sour cream but this recipe is perfect just the way it is.  My family and friends love this recipe! Thank you, so much!

The only things I do differently is that I use avocado oil and cut up the chicken into cubes.

Yes, I made changes, adapting to what I had on hand and simplifying. The recipe gives a great guideline to making a homestyle  curry that you can vary to suit your cupboard and taste.  

--I browned the onions first, using less oil and some water.
--I added 1/4 tsp. brown mustard seeds and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the spices, and substituted New Mexican Green chile for cayenne.
--I pushed the onions aside and browned lightly seasoned chicken thighs, skinned.
--I used 1/3 cup chopped cherry tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and skipped the yogurt, cilantro, etc. 
--I added 1/2 tsp. each fish sauce and soy sauce.

The curry is already rich and flavorful even without the additional enrichments of yogurt, garam masala, etc.  I find fresh tomatoes perk up the flavor even more than tomato sauce, perhaps because of their bright sweet acid taste.

Excellent Chicken Curry! I followed the directions, but basically doubled everything as I used 4 pounds of chicken. I will be making this as my ‘go-to’ chicken curry.

We loved Indian food, and this is a great recipe.  I  add peas because my husband loves peas.  Also, we are Lactose intolerant, and I use yogurt made with coconut milk.

Made few changes as I didn't have some of the spices, ended up making it super spicy and added some coconut milk to mellow it out a little, it was amazing & will 100% make it again.

So easy to make, and taste so good.  This is the first time I made Indian food and I am so happy I found this recipe. 
I followed exact the instruction with all the spices purchased at Sprout. Yummy!

I’ve never had this dish before so I wasn’t sure what we were getting into. The amount of spices threw me, I triple checked before I added because I was baffled at how much of everything is used. The sauce is nice and thick, the chicken comes out pretty tender. It was very tasty and an excellent combination of spices. My only recommendation would be to cut the cayenne pepper in half, if you don’t want it too spicy. If you don’t like spicy at all but want the flavor, maybe use 1/4-1/8tsp cayenne. For us, 1tsp was too much. It didn’t lose its flavor, but it made it harder to eat. We went through a lot of water and basmati rice to finish our plates. We will have this again at some point, but with spices reduced by 25% and the cayenne specifically by 50% or more. If you like spicy, leave it as is.

Made no changes the first time. Delicious and spicy! I felt like I was in a fine Indian restaurant. I have used chicken and shrimp and both are delicious. Use less spice if you’re sensitive to it.

Use much less oil and especiously  salt because you could always add later and I Used a little less crushed tomatoes in place of tomato paste which gives it a little more sweeter taste. And some finishing cilantro at the end came out pretty good

I made this Vegan by substituting the Chicken with Tofu, Yogurt with Non-Dairy Yogurt, and 3 tsp salt with 1 Tbsp Veggie Bouillon. The first time I thought it was amazing, but the second time it was just ok. I think I forgot to add the 1/2 cup water and lemon the first time. The second time the flavors seemed watered down. Maybe the crushed tomatoes needed to be cooked down more before the final simmer.

I absolutely loved it! (Followed the recipe to a T).  
I wonder if I could replace the chicken with lamb next time I make this dish. Any recommendations?

Delicious! 
I used half of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to accommodate eaters with low-ish spicy preferences, and it still had a bite to it.
I also cut the breasts into large pieces first.
I will definitely make it again.

Good meal! I doubled the amount of onion ginger and garlic. Cayenne spice to taste. Broth in place of water. Simmer with lid off not on and thicken with tapioca starch if needed. I served it with Jowar bhakri and basmati rice, my friends loved it!

Really enjoyed it, even if I forgot to put in the Garam Masala! :-)

I also only used half the cayenne pepper as my husband and I can't do spicy.

Delicious! A keeper.

AMAZING flavor!   Super easy to make as well.   I cut the chicken into larger bite size pieces and browned slightly to cook faster.  Served with basmati rice.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! My daughter's best friend is Indian and she said it tasted just like their's. I had a hard time finding garam masala, so I looked up how to make it myself~so easy. Will definitely be making this again.

do you really need to add cumin, termuric, and coriander?? because between the curry powder and garam masala, they include a combination of those same spices. If anybody can answer this for me i would appreciate it.  I tried this and it was soooo spicy i had to double the yogurt, add two cans of coconut milk, the juice of two whole limes, tomato sauce, and some honey to knock off the spiciness and cool it down. Then i ended up with a soup and had to add a bunch of cornstarch to thicken it up.....

First review and I have many many all recipe recipes I go to.  I have made chicken curry from scratch, but it never was noticeability better than using the curry past, so I took the easy route.  But I didn't have curry paste on hand so I tried this recipe... must have been meant to be.  It is terrific.  I didn't have yogurt on hand so I used a combination of coconut milk and light cream.  So very delish and glad I doubled the recipe to freeze a meal.  Well done, and thanks!

I made this it was to thick so I added 1cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of cream. My crushed tomatoes were tart so I put in 2 tablespoons of sugar. The two teaspoons of Cheyenne pepper was just right for me but, was to spicy for some. With that said it was delicious.

Made as directed except I didn't have any coriander so I left that out and added a pinch of cinnamon.  I added chickpeas and cauliflower.  Wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe.

Left out the cayenne and added more curry and red chili powder.  Did not use any lemon juice.  It was very very good and I have made chicken Curry previously.

This is really good & pretty simple to make!  I didn't have yogurt on hand, so I used sour cream & it was just fine.  Probably one of the best curries I've made.

In step #3, the recipe calls for adding a half cup of water and bringing to a boil. This is a big mistake because the high heat causes the yogurt to separate. Next time I make it I WON'T do this!

Doesn't affect the flavor, just doesn't look appetizing.  Unfortunately, I made it for a church group tonight; no time to redo.

I used a roasted (leftover) breast, shredded.  Followed the recipe for everything else, added the chicken at the end.  I didn't have cilantro, so I opted for minced Jalapenos.  Delish and quick.

We have used this recipe twice (he preps; I cook) and it has been wonderful both times.  We love curry on a rainy or cold day! Because of the wide variety of spices, it can be pricey for someone who may only make the dish once,  but we use these spices frequently. Note to those newbies: you can make this dish using just the basic spices: curry powder, cumin, cayenne.... The outcome will not have the depth of flavor the true recipe has, but will work if you want to keep it simple. You will probably need to add more curry powder.

The only change we made was cutting back on the cayenne. Our curry powder is medium hot so 1/4 tsp was enough additional heat for us. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

We have plans to use this recipe for fish curry and shrimp curry in the near future. Too bad I don't like lamb!

p.s. we eat a paleo diet, so forego the rice and naan (wah!). Last night we cooked the sauce down to a thick stew , spooned it into raw bell peppers, topped with cilantro and baked for 45 minutes at 350. Fabulous!

This was flavorful and delicious. My only complaint is that it was not spicy enough for me. I like my Indian food to be REALLY hot. The base recipe is super mild. I actually added a few hot chilies at the same time as the onion, but it still needed more. I think next time, I'll add a few more chilies and maybe a tablespoon...or more cayenne.

Followed this exactly and it was amazing - family said it was better than a restaurant.  Next time I will use some green chilis for a different type of heat.

Knowing your stove top well is key to making this dishes. There were also several substitutions of ingredients with this dish that in my opinion made it better.

First time making Curry anything and this was wonderful! I was a little scared to put all the seasonings and didn't put as much as the recipe called for, but I should have! I also didn't put the ginger root and I wasn't missing it.

Cut way back on the cayenne. The flavor is delicious, but I added about half the amount of cayenne and still found it to be a little too spicy (the only change I made), and I like spicy. I think 1/4 teaspoon would be good. Everything else is perfect. It's a good recipe to make and then tweak to your preference. It has a legitimate Indian restaurant flavor to it.

Tastes really close to what you would get at our local Indian restaurant.  We reduce the cayenne because some folks in my family are not really spicy food fans.  I also reduce the salt to just the seasoning on the chicken.

Excellent! We make this all the time. We cut the cayenne in half, because we found the full tsp way too hot. I also am generous with the other spices. Lastly, I add the yogurt at the very end because the first time it curdled. Serve with some warm naan, yum.

What a delightful dish.  I have been searching for an easy and yummy recipe that the whole family would like.  This was definitely a hit.  I added a cubed potato and a chopped carrot and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Yum!

This dish is great.  I cut the oil in half for calorie reasons, and replaced the cayenne pepper with 5 Serrano peppers.  I've made Indian many times, but this is a great recipe for very British curry style chicken.  Very good!

Aside from not adding the cayenne pepper because I was cooking for small children, I didn't change anything. It was fabulous. Certainly a keeper for my family.

This was incredible. Even better than the restaurant I usually go to for my Indian food fix. I did modify a couple of things, though. First, I did half chicken, half shrimp and simmered raw, thawed shrimp for the last 10 minutes (I had shrimp lying around that needed to be used up). Secondly, I didn't add the yogurt until the end after I had turned off the heat, removed the pan from the burner, and let the curry cool down for a couple minutes to prevent curdling. Next, I followed everyone's advice and cut the cayenne pepper in half and even then, it was a TAD too spicy. Still delicious but still pretty hot if you're sensitive to heat. Next time, I'll use only 1/4 of a teaspoon and see how that tastes. And lastly, I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground clove just because I love the flavor. 
Other than those slight modifications, I followed the recipe identically and it turned out amazing. It's the best thing I've ever cooked to be honest lmao

It was great!!!!! I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't use chicken.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes,  so I chopped up a roma tomato. I also used vegetable boullion instead of salt and I mixed it in with the onions, ginger and garlic; other than those changes I followed the recipe. I will definitely make it again!

This is such a great curry recipe.  I cut the calories a bit by using 1/4 cups of oil and 0% Greek yogurt.  The addition of fresh mango at the end is delicious.

Delicious :)  Since i don't need the extra fat, I just sautéed my chicken in Pam. I also substituted  1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper for the 1 teaspoon of cayenne. Also used fat free FAGE Greek yogurt.
My picky boyfriend loved it.

No leftovers! Our guests wiped the serving bowl clean with naan bread. I made this recipe in my Instant Pot! I put all ingredients - except chicken - into my Vitamix and whipped it until smooth. I also added in 1 whole small green chilie seeds and all minus the stem. I cubed the chicken and put it in the bottom of the Instant Pot and poured the whipped ingredients over. Gave it a quick stir and locked the lid on place. Set high pressure for 12 minutes then used a 10 minute natural pressure release (NPR). Stir - pour into serving dish, sprinkle with fresh chopped cilantro and serve over basmati rice - which can also be made in the Instant Pot.

I was short on time, so I put everything in the slow cooker except yogurt and lemon juice.  I also cut the cooking oil in half since I wasn't pre-cooking, and added the remaining half of the cooking oil to the slow cooker.  I reduced the ginger to 1 teaspoon because I'm not a big ginger fan.  I also substituted garam masala with tandoori masala because that's what I had on hand.  I used 4 big frozen chicken breasts.  After it was all cooked, I tried to take out any fatty bits while I shredded the chicken.  Then I added the yogurt. 
 
I served with brown rice and wedges of lime (all I had on hand).  It was delicious and easy.   My family all loved it.  There was just the right amount of sauce for the rice.  I'm going to double it all next time for more leftovers.

sub the yogurt for coconut milk - only the thick part at the top of the can. 
Husband said this was the best indian curry he has ever had at home or at a restraurant.
BTW: My family has always voted me to go on the "worse cooks", so trust me, it is the recipe that is so amazing.

Lovely recipe. I did add more cumin and curry powder when I was tasting as it was cooking, but that's because I'm very used to Indian food, and I love it. Otherwise I made the recipe as written.
It was thick and flavourful and the next time I make it it will be with shrimp, added about 4 minutes before serving.

LEAVE THE RECIPE AS IS! I've experimented with using full fat coconut milk instead of yogurt, and while it was good, it just wasn't the same. The tang & creaminess of the yogurt really brings everything together.  Fabulous recipe!

This should not be made in 20 minutes. I slowed cooked it over low heat for several hours then let it sit overnight and ate it the following day. To get the flavour right take your time cooking it. My family loved it far more than I did, I would give it a 3 but my family thinks it is a 5 so I guess a 4 is fair. Try it you might just love it or like me it is just okay.

The only thing I might change is the amount of oil (1/2 cup) used to fry chicken. I will reduce because there was a layer of oil just sitting on the sauce.
Just the right amount of EVERYTHING else tho. 
I also used a combo of brown rice and quinoa, simmered in chicken  stock.
WILL MAKE AGAIN

Really great!  I did only use 1/2t cayenne (it was plenty hot) and skipped the garam masala and lemon juice.  We ate over rice.  I would use a little more yogurt next time.

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe, but used only 6 chicken legs, added potatoes, carrots, yellow bell pepper, and broccoli (cause it was in the fridge)... I wanted more veggies than meat, this was GREAT!!! Next time I'll try with tofu, or just veggies!

Excellent recipe! my girlfriend and I love it dearly, however i have made a few minor changes due to personal preference. I add 2 diced jalepenos in with the onions, garlic and ginger root. Also I use about 1 1/2 tsp of curry powder and cumin with 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and 3/4 tsp of turmeric and coriander.

Wow. So tasty! I was missing coriander and garam masala, but my husband and I had no complaints. Mmm. Next time I'll try adding the spices after adding the tomatoes and yogurt with the hope that the spices will clump less. Even so, everything worked out really well. Give yourself ample time to prepare it because it can take longer to make than anticipated...depending on how quickly your chicken cooks.

**I paired it with a tasty Naan bread that helped to tone down the hotness of the curry and earned me additional kudos points for authenticity from the husband. ;)

My family enjoyed this, thank you, and I will make it again.  I used  ground ginger instead of fresh.  I did not use the Garam Masala due to personal preference and just completely forgot the lemon juice at the end...but it still tasted good.  Thanks again.

Wow, this was amazing! I love chicken curry, but i dont have any good selections in my area. I definitely dont need anyone else with this recipe. 

Tip: Make sure you add all the spices together in a bowl. I know this is a no brainer, but i made the mistake and my curry powder was sitting with sautéed onions while i measured out  the rest of the spices, slight burning.

Really wonderful.  I made as written with a little less cayenne pepper - it was still a nice amount of heat with a little reduction.   It took about an hour - just as they'd listed.  I served it with rice and steamed carrots. I'll make it more often!

I always cut the chicken breast into cubes before browning, rather than keeping the chicken breast whole as the recipe says.  I also always start with the amount of spices in the recipe, but usually add a lot more of everything, especially hot curry powder and cumin.  But it is easy, tastes great and makes great leftovers.

This is a wonderful curry, my husband wouldn't complain if I made it several times a week.  I generally substitute cream for the yogurt. I found it a bit tart with both the lemon juice and yogurt. But it's a very flexible and forgiving recipe, so use what you have on hand.

Super easy. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts since its what I had. I was running low on the spices so I used Green Curry paste instead of the spices that get added to the mixture. I also used turmeric and I had the Garam Masala that I added to the final steps. Great recipe!

This is the first time I made murgh kari. It was very easy to follow. I added double curry powder and garlic. I also made my own tomatoe sauce with it  and it still turned out wonderful.

Excellent recipe.  It's quite spicy but that's not a bad thing, just be prepared for it or maybe cut down on the cayenne a bit .  Made with a side of rice.

A great recipe!  I made it exactly as prescribed and it turned out wonderfully.  The only disappointment was that the yogurt curdled; I'll try adding a bit of flour to the yogurt next time, as another reviewer suggested.

Wow! This recipe was absolutely wonderful! The only thing that I did for my taste was to lower the amount of cayenne pepper, because I don't like spicy food. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this again!

I agree with the first one do not changed the recipe. I found it invigorating making this. My autistic nine year old son even found it pleasing and gave me a kiss on my forehead for making it. I've eaten at a variety of Indian restaurants up and down California sharing similar recipes this one is dead on, I made it with a side of raita and Indian rice with turmeric and spices, and naan bread. I can also understand how errors could be made... it's all about timing and getting the right ingredients which I did. I feel if you don't have them all and you don't time it right it may not come out the way you hoped..... follow it well and it will be perfect, thank you so much for sharing this recipe for my family to enjoy..... PS if you can't find the ingredients you're looking for go to a local natural food store and you can find normally jars with those spices. Trader Joe's, Sprouts, and Green Acres is not one of those stores... I mean really Natural Food local store

One HUGE problem. Three adults ate all of it! This dish was absolutely amazing. I will have to double up next time I guess! I used 1 cup coconut milk because we have dairy issues in the family. I also substituted tomatoe sauce for crushed tomatoes. I always use chicken thighs and diced them after reading several reviews. I only used 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and it was just the right spice for us. Unbelievable recipe!

Very good! I did not change a thing. If you can't tolerate too much spiciness, I would recommend to cut back a little on the cayenne pepper and curry powder.

This recipe was great.  I followed every thing to the T, except I added diced potatoes because I didn't have enough chicken on hand and I blended my curry mixture before adding the chicken back to the pan. The spice was perfect. We served with basmati rice and naan. This will be my go to curry recipe from now on.

This is an excellent recipe.. I made just as it was written.. except to marinate the chicken in citrus and salt and pepper prior to cooking.  I may have liked a few more vegetables in the curry.

I made this last night. Didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger and i used a third of the amount of Cayenne. Added a bit of flour to thicken up the curry. Delicious!

Delicious! After browning the chicken I did remove most of the leftover oil, there was just too much oil in the pan for me.  Recipe made quite a bit of sauce, so I'll be heading back to the store for more chicken (maybe another 1-2 pounds). Otherwise, good flavor, will make it again!

This has become a regular dish for us. It's absolutely delicious, relatively easy, and far better than similar meals I've had in some restaurants. The fact that my wife and I both love it so much is significant because we were both raised on boring ol' "meat & potatoes."

Very good recipe.  I will make it again.  The wife said definitely make it again.  Rated 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons.  First, I would have preferred an instruction giving the option to use less oil.  The recipe was made exactly as written and 1/2 cup vegetable oil in this recipe was too much for us.  (Still very good.)  Will use less oil when I make it again.  Second, the simmer time was not enough for our tastes.   After test tasting when it should have been finished according to recipe instructions, the spices needed more time to properly fuse.   An hour later, much better.   Look forward to making this again.

The first time I made it, I made no changes to it, and it was delicious. However, my family is half vegetarian and one of the meat eaters avoids dairy. So the next time I made it, I used coconut yogurt and substituted half a can of chick peas and some sauteed hard tofu for the chicken. It was still good, though I have to say the chicken version was better. I basically would not change a thing if your family has no dietary restrictions. This was absolutely fabulous!

This dish is very good, but the preparation is perhaps a little too complex, because there are so many discrete additions to the curry as it is developing. Also, it uses redundant ingredients: curry powder, which is any of several commercially prepared spice blends, plus most of the individual spices contained therein. I have made this twice, and I plan to put parentheses around the ingredients that go in at the same time so they can be staged together. Also, I'm wondering if it could be simplified by just adding the ingredients at two or three different times, instead of all the many separate additions the recipe calls for. However, despite these criticisms, I followed it as closely as I was able both times, and it came out tasting really good.

Yummy! Doubled the sauce and spices because I like things saucy. I thought the seasonings as written were perfect. I made this for  2 people (we both loved it) and the leftovers were just as delicious (or better) the next day. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this several times. It is our favorite curry dish although we haven’t tried many. I do cut the chicken into large pieces as it makes it easier to cook and serve IMO and more of the chicken’s surface is covered in the sauce.

Ooooh weeeee!    I was bored one night and decided to cook dinner for that day and at 3 AM in the morning I chose this recipe.  The house smelled so good from the aroma  of the spices my brother came down stairs to see what I was cooking.
However I change two things.  I used chicken thighs bone-in and  canned whole tomatoes  because that's what I had on hand. The dish was absolutely perfect on my first try, so I always use chicken thighs. Flavor is in ABUNDANCE,and that's really an understatement. I serve it with naan and jasmine rice.  It's my brothers favorite dish.  Now I have to cook this  fo r him every two weeks.  We love it!!!

Followed the recipe exactly (except reduced the salt) and it was very good.  A couple of people added a bit of cayenne as they felt it needed a bit more heat.  Added a bit more yoghurt on day two as it lost the creaminess overnight.

No changes made. It was great just the way it is written. May be too spicy for some.

This recipe is great but I made a few changes. Are used nonfat Greek yogurt and did rounded tablespoons of each space. It turned out awesome! I put the Varma masala in with the rest of the spices instead of sprinkling it on top. I'll definitely be making this again! I also cooked the chicken differently, Chrissy Teagan style. By boiling very salty water then putting the chicken in and turning the water off, putting the lid on, and waiting about 10 minutes. The chicken was halfway cooked, I took it out and chop it up into tiny pieces then put it in the curry sauce to finish cooking. This keeps the chicken from getting dry.

I cooked it in the crockpot on low for a few hrs and it turned out amazing! I also added a considerable amount of cayenne because I'm a spicy lover. Pairs great with coconut rice!

I put 2 potatoes and 3 carrots in it.  I didn't have cilantro, lemon juice, turmeric or masala.  It was still delicious.

Thank you so very much for posting this recipe! I make it  every other week now with basmati rice and  it is delicious!  If I could tweak it a bit,  I'd only want to know how to make it a little spicier. It's a perfect recipe, really.

A great, easy dish! I wish I could've made it according to the recipe, but living in a location with limited access, I substituted what I had on hand. That said, if you ever need to replace the fresh ginger with powdered; the crushed tomatoes with tomato puree; the yogurt with sour cream + milk; and/or the lemon juice with happy thoughts, have no fear! This recipe can handle some abuse and still not disappoint!

The seasonings really come together to give a full bodied flavor. The approach of having the seasonings in the oil intensifies and brings out the flavors. I will make again, it's soooo good.

I'm not usually into spicy foods, but this dish has just the right amount of heat without being overpowering.  My personal touch is to add a couple of chopped carrots to give it something extra.

Highly recommended!

This must be an authentic Indian chicken curry recipe. Tastes just as good, if not better, than dining out.  Next time I make it, I will go a tad lighter on the crushed tomatos and measure the spices before hand.  Thank you!

Have made this many times and love it! I use about 1/4 the amount of cayenne pepper b/c the amount in the recipe was too much for me (I usually go with 2/5 spicy at restaurants).

The spice blend was in point but I had to add bay leaves and a little black pepper. I also subbed diced tomatoes with half a can of tomato paste as we don't like it sauce as tomato heavy.

This was a  great recipe and has become our favorite Indian style recipe.  
I did make a couple changes. I caramelized the onions before adding the spices and put the Garam Masala and 1 tbsp of curry in with the rest of the spices. I also coated the chicken in curry before only browning the chicken for a couple minutes before letting it cook in the sauce.

I made this with chunks of chicken thigh meat, and didn't use garam masala because I didn't have any. Added potatoes and carrots, and it turned out pretty good!

Lovely and easy to follow. I too added dried indian red chillies as well as red chilli powder for more heat...this recipe is not that spicy so its good for a more western pallet. Will make again!

My spouse purchased this dish from a newly opened Indian Food Stand in Las Vegas at the Link Casino outdoor foodcourt for about $10, before making this dish for me.  When he made this recipe I enjoyed it as extremely.  It was as good if not better than what he purchased for me, and that was 2 meals back to back, lunch & dinner, lunch theirs, dinner this recipe .

I usually write reviews only when I follow the recipe exactly, but my husband and kids can't tolerate the heat so I left out the cayenne. I wish I didn't have to because it was so good and would have been even better  if I added it like I was supposed to. The only other substitution was sour cream instead of yogurt because I didn't have any. 

I would definitely make this again but add the cayenne (even if is just a little bit).  Loved it!

very good! I modified it a little.... used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, used coconut milk instead of yoghurt, used fresh tumeric instead of dried spice. I coated chicken in olive oil, garlic powder , pepper & salt, and baked the chicken while I was making the sauce. When sauce was done & chicken skin brown, I drained chicken fat from baking dish & poured sauce over the chicken and put it back in the oven for 15 mins. to mingle flavors. Served with brown basmati rice. Very spicy authentic flavor. Loved this dish.

It was a hit the only thing I would change is the name. This was Butter Chicken and not so much Chicken Curry in my mind but it was still fantastic!

I've made many 'curry' dishes.  This I believe is one of the best I've ever made.  No changes, followed exactly.  Almost forgot the lemon at the end but glad I remembered.  Adds a delightful touch.  Make it a day ahead to let the flavors do their thing.  Can put less cayenne if you don't like it spicy.  Found it had just the right zing for me but some folks (or kids) prefer just a little.
Leftovers today with anelli pasta and it's still wonderful!!  Thanks.

This is always a  hit and is now my go to curry recipe!  I only make two small changes.  After sautéing the onion and other ingridients I create a well in the veggies and toast the spices for a few seconds before incorporating.   I also add a 15 oz can of diced *fire roasted tomatoes.  We like to serve it over basmati rice.

edit: my husband and I are fine with the spice level.  My kids need it less spicy.  So for them I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp.  I also now add a couple of sliced zucchini's half way through cooking the onion.

This recipe is awesome! My curry has turned out delicious.
I have used boneless chicken thighs instead of the breast, added 3 jalapenos (seeds and membranes removed) to the onion mix, and decreased cayen pepper to one tsp.  I also used goat milk yogurt. Served with white basmati rice, garlic naan, and plain steamed cauliflower. A glass of white wine was quite complimentary! Highly recommend!

My husband isn't a curry fan and my son is a very picky eater. They both loved this dish! My husband went back for seconds. I did change the dish a little. I didn't have cayenne pepper. So I added 2 teaspoons of an Indian red curry paste. Yum.

Simple and delicious.  No need to overdo any ingredients, it's balanced as is.  Some people recommend coconut milk and of course that would make it even more rich, but that's definitely optional.  I'm actually going to try this in the crock pot with no oil, at all. The flavor is there.  If you are fearful of spicy food, use half the cayenne (or a quarter).  The spicy level was perfect for me, as I love it hot.

I made no changes and have access to fresh spices or grind my own.  The family loved it. I was making dahl, rice and nan.  I found this recipe for a last minute addition.  Easy, simple, and very tasteful.

I love Indian food, and am always looking for delicious authentic curry recipes. And this is one. I cooked the dish exactly as the recipe except: (1) I used boneless chicken thighs rather than breast (worked just as well); (2) I added one medium hot red chilli (for a little bit of spice) as I noticed there was minimal spice and (3) halfway through the recipe I spooned off some of the oil as there was just too much for my personal likings.  We had this between four hungry people, and it was the right amount of food. Next time: I would cook with half the recommended oil, and I would use two medium hot chillis (one gave it a very very mild spice - just warming on the palate).  Definitely a winner dish!

Excellent dish. A fair bit of prep and clean-up, but entirely worth it. I cut the salt in 1/2, add a ton more cilantro, some par-steamed broccoli(About 8 mins), and on occasion some par-boiled chopped up potato chunks(About 10 mins). Serve over some jasmine rice with some hot naan and a loosened belt

Delicious - I made this last night with the following changes: Replaced oil & water with chicken broth, used diced vs crushed tomatoes, cut the cayenne in 1/2, didn't add salt, added carrots & peppers, used Chobani Coconut Greek yogurt instead of plain! YUM!  My husband loved this as well.

WOW!  This recipe really surprised me. First of all, my husband and I have been frequently visiting our local Indian restaurant because we love the chicken curry and naan.  I read every review and I took all of the advice I could use. The ONLY thing I changed was the amount of cayenne. I thought I could taste test it all along to and always add more if I needed to. So, I started out with 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. I had every other ingredient in my kitchen spice cabinet and I measured it all out ahead of time. I chopped the onion and set it aside, I minced the garlic and ginger and set it aside. I measured the water and the tomatoes and yogurt... all of it so I would not waste time when actually cooking it. I monitored the temperature and didn't overcook the chicken. When I tasted the spoon on my first attempt my eyes popped out of my head.  My first thought was, "I"ll never have to go back to our favorite Indian restaurant again!"  Keep in mind, I am very sensitive to MSG or it's 25 hidden derivatives. When I go to restaurants that have spicy foods they usually, not always but usually, contain some sort of flavor enhancers or MSG.  I have two days of backlash for eating it, too but I do it for Friday night date nights with my man......  ey ey ey..  The things we do for love. So, this recipe was the BOMB.  I will puree my crushed tomatoes and really tiny-dice the onions next time, because I love the smooth silky look and taste of this curry but nothing need change. I even made

This recipe is FANTASTIC! Very easy and you do not need to be trained in India to make it zing!
For such a simple ingredient list, and simple prep, you can't go wrong! 
A few tip's though (I am sure all will agree), use as fresh as possible spices. If you have a local spice shop, get fresh stuff! Yes it is expensive, but well worth it!!
Also, prepare chicken identically as described but try skin on and bone in whole chicken thighs. I browned with the skin on, removed skin, then fed the skin to the raccoons. Cook as shown with BONE IN. So much better flavor, and if the increased fat bothers you, discard the fat (I did) before you start the onion cooking!
Also, for real decadence, try Plain GREEK yogurt instead!

I subbed oregano for the coriander because I didn't have any and omitted the cilantro (hubby hates and pick out 1 part in 1,000)..  but exactly as is otherwise and it was DELICIOUS!  served atop basmati - great meal at home!!

I added Serrano peppers and or habanero peppers depending on who is eating with me.  Also I have been trying to be more organic and going with homemade crushed tomatoes. I also add Coriander in this recipe as well.

This came out great, I only used about 1/4 of the tomato sauce as I don't favor too much, and added extra chilies.

I make this probably once a week. When you're cooking for yourself, it makes a lot of food that you can keep eating for a day or two. It's delicious and super cheap to make once you own the spices. You can also play with the spices a bit - I tend to do a little more salt, cumin and curry than it calls for. I also eye the ginger and garlic (leaning towards a little more than called for). This is also really good if you make jasmine rice with chicken bullion (1 tablespoon per cup of rice) and coconut oil (1 teaspoon per cup of rice)

Really nice curry! Almost no changes for once, except that I used thigh meat instead of breast meat and I cut up the chicken instead of leaving it whole.  Will definitely make this again.

We have made this dozens of times now over the last 4 years. The first time we made it exact to recipe. My husband, my son who was 6 and I all really liked it.  The sauce was comparable to what you would get from a restaurant.  Since then I have made a couple changes and I only make the sauce anymore.  We use 1/2 & 1/2  instead of the yogurt so we get the same flavor but don't have to worry about curdling.  I use half yellow curry and half red curry to up the spice level. I also make a quadruple batch so this way we have enough for dinner one night and lunch or dinner the next day. With the leftovers I normally have enough to freeze several quart bags and we have found one bag is the perfect amount for the 3 of us for a meal.  Our favorite way to eat this now is to serve with garlic butter grilled shrimp and naan.

Just made this recipe for the first time and it turned out amazing.  I did make a couple of calculated changes.  First I used two 6oz containers of Greek Yogurt.  Also, I cut up the chicken breasts raw and cooked them right in the sauce.

made this last night with chicken thighs and added cubed potatoes. if you are vegetarian potatoes is a good hearty substitute for the chicken. There is so much flavor with the spices we wouldn't miss the meat. Sooooo Goooooood! Adding this to my digital recipe box =o)

It was excellent.  Even though there were quite a few ingredients, if you plan them all out ahead of time, the recipe is straightforward and easy to follow...and the final flavour is well worth it.    I'll definitely be making it again!

It was really good! I am making it again, but this time I'm substituting the chicken for lamb. I also added a lot more curry powder to make it spicier!

I made it and it was yum! I added 1 tablespoon of red chilli powder instead of 1 teaspoon and used drumsticks, next time will use boneless thighs, I just don't like breast pieces. The recipe is flawless.

I only had 5 ounces of plain yogurt so I added 3 ounces of coconut milk and the little sweetness was very nice.  Only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.

This recipe RIVALS that of any Indian restaurant curry. I used 1.5 lbs of lamb stew meat and allowed it to simmer on very low heat for one hour. PERFECT.

It was a little spicy, so adjust the cayenne to YOUR liking.

I didnt change anything but after I fried the chicken I put it in a crockpot. I added the yoghurt  before I ate it and added plenty of spices. I added the spices to my taste. I added more chicken  than the recipe but  I used the same ingredients.It was great over rice.Im going to make it again.

After many years of using this app, this is my first review. Amazing. My husband said "one of my favorite things you've ever made". And I'm Deep South southern and a pretty darn good cook. Followed recipe almost exactly - except cubed chicken before browning - hubby doesn't like to cut ;)  Awesome dinner!!!

Amazing! It's the only curry recipe I make now.  It's always better the next day, so make lots.  The only change I make is to lower the oil to 1 tablespoon, just my way to lower the calories, but it still tastes great.

This was fabulous!
Because some people in my home are sensitive to heat, reduced the cayenne by half. It had a little kick but not bad. I also omitted the tomatoes, again, to cater to the tastes in my home. Super good nevertheless! I served it with onion naan, rice and a cilantro mint chutney.

Really good.   It was not quite as smooth as restaurant butter chicken.   I could probably fix that by using cream and/or butter, but the yoghurt version is probably better for you.

After watching a movie called "The 100 Foot Journey" I been wanting to make a true Indian cuisine dinner! So after searching for a main dish to go with the Indian Carrot Rice, I also found on this site, I chose this Chicken. So I went to the store and to my surprise, I was able to find the Garam Masala Spice...I had everything else to make this dish at home! I followed the recipe exact, no short cuts.....this is amazing. It yells Indian Culture with every bite!! Thanks so much for sharing, this is my new favorite Indian Curry Chicken and will save this recipe to my favorites to make again many times in the near future!!

Delicious.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces first and also add a finely chopped stalk of celery at the same time as the onion. It won't take 8 minutes of cooking for the onion to become translucent.....5 min, max.  Consider adding  1/2 tsp ground cardamom to the spices. Serve over Basmati rice and with naan bread. Have made this three times now.

I use the jarred minced garlic and stir in ginger paste and it doesn't affect the flavor and makes it easier to keep all ingredients on hand. Only changes I make is to marinate the chicken beforehand in about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt, salt and some lemon juice at least 2 hours (overnight if I remember). Helps the chicken from getting to rubbery or chewy. For the spices, the mix here is great but I usually add a little extra curry powder (1 tsp) and cumin (1/2 tsp) to taste/smell as I cook and I usually chop the chicken into bite size chunks before adding back into the curry, but that's just a matter of personal preference.

Outstanding and simple as is. As a practice, I never modify a recipe the first time I make it ... then adjust it according my own taste. For this recipe in particular, no changes were needed at all ... but I began to experiment anyway.

>Cut chicken into chunks as another reviewer suggested. Excellent, reduced cooking time and easier to portion out.

> One time, I didn't have the yogurt on hand, so I subbed out sour cream... it made for a much richer sauce and really kicked up the heat... for my hot hot hot loving friends, I go the sour cream route.

> I find chicken thighs to be much more flavorful and moist, so I use boneless, skinless thighs, cut into 1" inch or so chunks... they take a bit more time to cook on the front end, but you end up with moist chicken that really takes on the flavor of the sauce.

> Dried cilantro can be subbed out, but it does change the flavor significantly. For those cilantro-haters out there... leave it out entirely, and you still have an amazing curry.

> I serve this over white rice. I combine the left over curry and rice together for a great lunch the next day your co-workers will envy.

This was delicious!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it, but me the most!  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes (28 vs 15 oz) since I was doing 10 chicken breasts in stead of 8.  It was more saucy and tasted great poured over the Indian Vegetable Rice (allrecipes.com).  The chicken was so tender (think sliced breasts preferred), it practically cut with a fork.  Note:  Since I was new to Indian cooking, I had no idea about garam masala when I went to the store so I bought Tikka Masala (a paste form; 2 tsp) and it still tasted great.  I then try to make my own dry version to sprinkle in at the end (crushed cloves, cumin, coriander, pepper, dry mustard, red pepper flakes).

It was great but hotter than my taste even when I left out the cayenne. I think I had a spicy curry powder. I did make a few substitutes for what I had on hand.: Greek yogurt, canned diced tomatoes, no ga masala. Next time I would add the yogurt at the last minute because letting the dish simmer, it separated a bit.

We made this recipe tonight and loved it! It absolutely was like something I would order from my favorite Indian restaurant. We replaced the yogurt with greek yogurt and used olive oil. I also left out the garam marsala, and it was fine. Lime in place of lemon because I prefer lime. The yogurt did clump/curdle a bit so we will try the tablespoon of flour addition as suggested in another review next time..because we will definitely be making this again.

Just an inch too spicy, but that is probably me being a pansy. The flavor was amazing.  I did not have garam masala so I used allspice instead.  Next time I make this  I will try a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  But honestly, outstanding meal!

There are a lot of ingredients in this recipe. It works best to have everything measured out before starting. This was the 1st time that I made a curry and it was delicious. I will be making this often.

Fantastic and authentic. I wanted more portions and simply doubled the recipe and it was perfect. I also cubed the chicken instead of using large whole halves.

I substituted 3/4 of a can of coconut milk for the yogurt because I didn't have the yogurt. This recipe was perfect and I would recommend making it again. Very good and warming spice. I also added Sriracha for some spice on Day 2. Oh, day 2 was even better than day 1. 

Thanks for sharing this!

This is my hubby's new favorite meal ... I wish I could get six servings out of one meal - he takes four of the servings himself!!  I stayed true to the recipe the first time, and now the only changes I make are to reduce the oil to 1/4 cup - and to add a lot more fresh cilantro (no such thing as too much cilantro!)  And, as another reviewer pointed out, make sure all of your ingredients are measured out first - it starts to move quickly.

I have made this dish about 5 times and I swear that it gets better every time. My daughter and I used to go to an Indian restaurant in our town, until it closed down about a year ago. The next closest restaurant is about a half hour away, so I started looking for a similar recipe to what I got there. This is so amazing. The only change I made was to add a little less cayenne so it wouldn't be too spicy for my 7 year old.

This recipie was by far the best curry I have tasted. Loved it and didn't change a thing except I used a hearty white fish instead of chicken. Im from the north and married an Alabama cowboy, so finding an indian resturant in this neck of the woods is nill to none. This is going in the family handwritten cookbook!!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and I, and we loved it so much! I followed the recipe almost exactly (Gasp! this is rare!) and it turned out great. Oh wait, I altered the serving size: two bone-in chicken breast halves, for 2 servings (instead of 2 lbs. boneless chicken breasts for 6 servings), but still used all the spices at full quantity. I would say the garam masala was an excellent addition. I might have used a bit more chopped fresh cilantro. I also mixed the spices together beforehand in a little bowl, and that helped to avoid overcooking the onion mixture. I also had read through the comments and worried about leaving the chicken breasts whole, but decided since they had bones to just leave them whole and they turned out super duper awesomely tender, spicy, moist, and delicious. Actually, this might be the key to the recipe. We devoured this over basmati rice, and then may have used our hands a bit to make sure all the chicken got ate up. That's always fun. I think my boyfriend licked the bowl.

This was the very best curry I have ever made! Not difficult at all and I had all the ingredients on hand. Will I make it again? You bet. Will I tinker with the recipe in the future? Probably, but I'm sure I'll always come back to this one. I'd like to try coconut milk instead of yogurt and add some vegi's but it will be very difficult to improve the original.

This recipe is awesome.  I made 2 different versions of it.  I followed the recipe and made the chicken curry. 
Then I replaced the chicken with eggplant but seared it just like the chicken. 
Both recipes are great

I've cooked many Indian dishes, but this is one I always come back to time and time again. It is so delicious. I have cooked it exactly to the recipe and I have also increased certain ingredients, garlic, onion, chicken, ginger etc. Something I have never done however is use half a cup of oil, I always use much less. Half a cup of oil? What's that all about?! Anyway, thumbs up for this superb recipe and my freezer is never stocked without it!

This was an excellent dish! I ended up using bone in chicken thighs and it turned out just as good, if not better. I browned them well and added them back to the pan to simmer, and found that even with the bone in that 20 mins was all it took to cook them through, just the same as the recipe called for with the chicken breasts. I didn't have garam masala but I made my own with 2 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves. The curry recipe only calls for 1 tsp but I just throw the rest in a container and save it for other meals. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, this is a keeper!!!

This recipe is amazing. I modified it by adding raisins. I sautéed the raisins in butter and added them at the end before serving.  I served it over basmati rice.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  I rarely make any recipe twice because there are so many recipes I want to try. This was so good I will definitely make it again

I have no complaints! I didn't have any garam masala on hand so a used a substitution listed in a previous review (cinnamon, ground coriander and salt?) - I think. Anyways It was great! Next time I'll cut the chicken into bite sized pieces though for easier quicker access :)

My husband is Indian and his mom is an excellent cook- so I was nervous about attempting this recipe. This was excellent and got rave reviews from the hubby- he said it was better than Moms! I agree with others about not changing a recipe before you review it- but I did have to make two small changes: I added about 6-7 minced Serrano peppers to the onion mixture because we like our food very very spicy, and I used one can of tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes because I opened my cupboard to find that's all I had! This was authentic and excellent and I will make this many times- maybe even for hubby's parents next time! Thank you for an awesome recipe.

This is simply delicious, with a nice hearty sauce and the perfect kick. Serve this over steamed basmati rice.  The squeeze of lemon with a dollop of yogurt on top before serving makes it that much better, and the cilantro garnish makes for a great presentation. Healthy and filling. Perfect for the dinner date at home  with that special someone. A must try.

I forgot the yoghurt so substituted a small can of evaporated milk ( which I have taken from another curry recipe) and it was quite easily the best curry I have made.  I suspect  if I use the yoghurt it would be stupendous.
THE BEST CURRY EVER.

Awesome recipe. I created it using 1 pound of turkey breast and mixed vegetables instead of the 2 lbs of chicken and grape seed  oil to fry the turkey in.  It came out as good as an Indian restaurant.

I have made this recipe many times now and love it.  Usually don't change much except I always use thighs (just a rule I have as they've managed to breed any and all flavor out of the breast) and, this time I have some chicken stock I want to use up so will throw that in instead of the water.  Other than that, I follow it as written.  Wonderful.  It is in my list of stock Indian recipes.

I've made this several times and love it every time.  I usually cube the chicken, but otherwise stay true to the recipe.  Everyone I've ever served it to has loved it and requested that I make it again.  :)

Excellent dish! 

I used thighs instead of breasts and made this in my pressure cooker.  I browned the chicken, then added the rest of the ingredients minus the yogurt and water.  I cooked it at high pressure for 20 minutes, did a quick release, then stirred in the yogurt. Never added the water. 

Next time I'll skip the browning altogether and leave out the cooking oil.

This was pretty good for a quick and simple curry.  I used the chicken breasts, but next time I may use boneless thighs instead as they are less likely to dry out.  I boosted up the quantities of the spices across the board as I really like a high level of spices. I'd make it again.

This was excellent. Satisfied my craving for Indian food. Spicing was very good, not over the top. The only change I made was to cube the chicken breast. Served over rice with some homemade naan bread.

I chose this recipe based on the spices because I'm not experienced at Indian cuisine. I wanted to use up leftover turkey, so I made a number of modifications based on what I had on hand. I'll definitely use this recipe again - and as my go-to for curry spicing - it was absolutely delicious and super easy, too!

Heck yes! Indian (curry) is my favorite 'go to' takeout. I am an avid cook & can hold my own in the kitchen however, when it comes to curry ... I disappoint myself every time. Atlas, I never give up hope. Decided to try this recipe.
I took the advice of others & made my own garam masala from this site.
I subbed tofu for chicken & added a few veggies). The gravy was amazing! I added coconut milk (didn't have yogurt) & added extra garam masala. Next time I will cut the salt way down. 
Will make again for sure! My boyfriend said 'we could order this from our fav. Indian restaurant!'
So, so pleased! 
Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Seriously loving this authentic Indian dish. Fairly easy to make and packs a flavorful punch! After reading the comments I cut the chicken in bite sized pieces, used half the cayenne, substituted 1/2c yogurt and 1c cocunut milk for the original 1c of yogurt, and added green peppers as well as cubed potatoes. However, even without the amendments this recipe is a winner. Will definitely make again.

As per the suggestion of another reviewer, I added chiles and (because I did not have it) omitted the cilantro.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  Both my husband and I really liked it.

I have made this recipe for my boyfriend and I several times, and every time he dies over it!  I crave this all the time. We like a LOT of spice so I usually add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and I double up on the cayenne pepper. I serve it with basmati rice and garlic tandoori naan. The leftovers taste amazing too!

This is the first time I have ever made a curry and the comments I received were very positive.  I took it in to work for one of my Indian colleagues, who was very surprised at how authentic it tasted, commenting that it was better than some of her relatives curries!

I halved the amount of the cayenne pepper and it was perfect.  I think a whole teaspoon would have been too spicy.  I suppose it is personal preference at the end of the day.

It is absolutely delicious.  As one of the reviewers suggested, I added the extra Thai chili pepper ( about 6) and increased the cayenne pepper to 3 tsp for it to be extra spicy.  The sauce is heavenly.

I'm not quite sure what i think about this...on one hand the flavors were on point but the texture was just off. i feel that if you swap out the yogurt for coconut milk or at least do half yogurt and half coconut milk it would change the recipe for the better. i added lime juice, bok choy, wine, sesame oil, and dried parsley to my dish (improves the overall flavor by a long shot :))

Amazing, authentic flavor and very easy to make.  I made no changes whatsoever.  Its quite hot, to say the least, but absolutely delicious.  I travel to India quite a bit and the fragrances generated by this dish bring wonderful memories every time.

Great, but a little spicy for the kids. 5 stars with these adjustments: Did 1 tsp of ground ginger instead of fresh (don't have fresh readily available).  Did 1/2 tsp of cayenne instead of 1 tsp (to decrease the spiciness).  Did 15 oz of tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes (it was what I had avalable, and I think it helped the dish have a smoother texture).

I improv-ed a lot on this one... No Garam masala , coriander, cilantro or lemon juice.i used chipotle pepper, curry in both spice mic and extra Greek yogurt, lime, clove and tom-ka  seasoning with all above ingredients. I used a Dutch oven with bone in chicken breasts. I browned the meat as directed (just longer to get the skin nice and crispy and meat to cook accordingly), then followed the directions until the end where I placed the Dutch with everything yummy in it, in the oven for about a half hr on 285 degrees. Let the juices sit and cool for a bit and the end result was AMAZING!!! I say play around if you don't have all the ingredients ...the recipe is a Great place to start...so much that the finish can't really ever be bad!

I prepared the recipe last night, and have to mention that it was exquisite. It has the exact flavors as you would expect from an Hindi restaurant. 
The only comment would be to reduce a little bit the amount of oil and water, as it prevents the sauce from thickening enough.

I made this past Sunday and have made it three times since!  Two were for friends that tasted the first batch.  I have made it exactly as stated, and also using olive oil.  All tasted great.  I gave this to some Filapino friends, and the mother loves it so much, she asked me for the recipe so she can serve at next potluck they have.  This will be made monthly!

This is the curry recipe that I've been looking for.  I didn't add the half cup of water at the end because I like a thicker sauce, but this is really great.

Absolutely delicious!  We wanted something new and different and this was it.  I only made one adjustment and that was to cut the oil in 1/2 to brown the chicken.   It is spicy so if you don't like your nose to run you might cut a little of the cayenne but we love it!

I used this recipe as a basis for my own dish, and it turned out very good. I used chicken thighs and sour cream instead of breasts and yogurt. I added some dry mustard instead of corriander and garum marsala. In other words, this recipe is very adaptable. It is spicy, but not overwhelming. The sauce goes excellently over rice and vegetables.

I ADORE this recipe I wanted a real Indian style chicken curry and I found it in this recipe. I will look no more. 2 very small changes I made cuz I can't take too much heat - 1/2 tsp Cayenne pepper, used tomato sauce and put 1 cup of coconut milk with the yogurt to smooth out all flavors. I am not a fan of Thai-type curries with creams but it really made it sensational.I did not have cilantro and did not put lemon. I took a trip from a reader and mixed all spices before I started, great tip. If you're looking for a GREAT chicken curry recipe, try this one first!

I just made this and it was delicious! I am excited not to have to order out for Indian! Also, a very cheap but flavorful dinner once you have stocked all the spices. I left out the cilantro, because I didn't have any on hand, and it was fine without it. It was a tad spicy for me (I am not a very spicy food person) so I think I might do without the cayenne pepper next time.

I used Greek yogurt. I could not find garam masala at an supermakets in my city so I used a substitute garam masala spice mix which I actually found on this site.  My wife is sensitive to spicy hot food so I only put half of the amount of cayanne. There wasn't much of a selection of crushed tomatoes, so I bought a can of whole tomatoes and crushed them myself.  This was served over organic jasmine rice.  It was so......frickin.....good!  Better than the  they sell in the jars, that's for sure.  I'm really glad I wrote this one down and saved it in our recipe box, because I will definitely make this one again.

I've been on a mission trying to find a perfect chicken curry recipe and this got very close to what I was looking for. Although slightly different in taste from what I'm used to, it tasted great all the same. I've been finding so many blah curry chicken recipes and the spice in this one was perfect.

We truly loved this recipe.  It was a little spicy so put some sour cream in it but other than that it was amazing!!!!! The second time I used a pinch of garam masala instead of a teaspoon and I also used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of the teaspoon. I also substituted the yogurt for sour cream.

Excellent recipe! Made this last night and it was so flavorful and delicious. I ran out of tumeric but it didn't seem to affect the overall dish. Also didn't have garam marsala so I used the easy garam marsala recipe.

Also, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I just pulsed about 4 large tomatoes in my food processor to crush it up and stewed it with the spice and onion mixture for 20 minutes before adding in everything else. I added the yogurt to taste and included a dash of coconut milk as others suggested. Added some green beans, but I bet peas would be good too. 

Wonderful recipe - this one is a keeper.

I loved this recipe. Very flavorful and easy to make. I've made it a couple of times and have changed it a bit to make it more of a one-pot casserole. I cook it in a dutch oven and cut up the chicken instead of leaving the breast whole. I add one large diced potato and about three or four diced carrots at the same time as I return the chicken to the pot (and use 1 cup of water at this point instead of 1/2 cup). Then at the end I add about four cups of cooked brown rice (you could probably cook the rice in the dish itself but I'm not a great cook and end up burning it on the bottom of my pot).  It's a very hearty meal that lasts me most of the week.

My first ever curry recipe and the only one I need! This cury is absolutely flavorful and delicious. Very easy directions and a simply recipe to throw together in one pot. I have made it for all of my family and friends, who otherwise would have never tried curry, and have a group of followers who LOVE it!

Perfect for hangovers. Heavenly dish just as good the next morning cold.  I used 25% less spices, 50% more onions, and found it divine.

I loved this dish! This is my 1st review on allrecipe.com, and I have made several dishes so far, but this indian dish is by far the best dish I made I think in my life! It was a bit spicy for me, but it was so good! I didn't have cumin, but had all the other ingredients, and it came out restaurant quality food! I would probably put more onions and cilantro next time. I read someone's review about cutting the chicken into cubes and reducing the salt, so I did just that! Good recommendation. Thanks!

Other than having no cilantro, I followed the recipe exactly and threw everything in the slow cooker for a few hours.  Hubby and I really enjoyed it - a perfect blend of spices and not too hot for our taste.  We had it with pineapple brown rice and it was a perfect dinner that didn't take a lot of effort.

This is a wonderful recipe! It has become a weekly staple for my family, especially with naan. The spices are great -- nice and strong. Sometimes I cut down on the amount of meat and add vegetables instead, because you can't go wrong with more vegetables. Delicious!

We absolutely loved this!  My suggestion would be to not eat it night one, but rather let it sit and have it as "leftovers"  Like any type of food like this, it's usually better second/third day.

to make it more authentic 2 things should be changed. 1) fry the onions alone untill they look like http://www.tigersandstrawberries.com/wp/wp-content/finishedonions.jpg this then add garlic and ginger...continue as normal

2)dont bother browning the chicken, use cubed chunks (1 inch give or take)and throw them in when it says to add the browned chicken... 20min is enough to cook small chunks with the lid on. your chicken will come out melt in your mouth delicious and the curry will have penetrated it more. 

i reailze my name isnt indian but i have a friend from india, having made this in front of him and had him and having his friends/exchange students make their curry recipes for me for me.... those were their suggestions / variations. 

pro tip for authenticity, wash your hands first but scoop the rice and chicken directly into them. ive never seen them eat it with silverware when its a group of indians eating it.

I subbed 1 can full fat coconut milk instead of the yogurt & used 1.5 cans of 19oz tomatoes.  Barely any cayenne.  Used coconut oil to fry the onions, etc in!  It was sooo good!!

I made this recipe yesterday and it was awesome! The only variation that I did was cut the chicken into chunks and added a can of tomatoes with green chilies.  I had family members who dislike curry and LOVED this recipe because the flavor was excellent!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I substituted chicken breasts for thighs. Wow! What a fantastic dish! Very tasty, savory and just spicy enough without being too hot. I chose this recipe from many online and have no regrets. Everyone loved it! I served it with white rice, Aloo Gobi, Indian spicy green beans and naan. I can't  wait to try what little I have left for lunch tomorrow.

Just made this tonight and it was FABULOUS. Tasted just like what I order at my local Indian restaurant! I cooked this up for my parents and they were floored, definitely going to make this again. I did make one minor change which was just a preference thing-- I used 1/2 cup of coconut milk in place of the 1/2 cup water, just because I like the flavor. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it came out phenomenally. Definitely recommend!

As written, it was okay, but not very flavorful. I had to increase all of the spices and did not care for the lemon juice and sour cream. Maybe a plain yogurt or coconut milk would have been much better.

A really good curry!  However, I would advise caution with the salt. The recipe suggests 3 teaspoons in all.  I'm not adverse to salt but I used 1 teaspoon in all and it is just about right.

This recipe is one of my favorites. I made a few changes to my liking. I added light cream instead of yogurt, 1/8 tsp of cayenne. It over powered the dish the first time, and tomato paste or sauce instead of crushed.

Phenomenal. I wanted a thicker sauce that I could "scoop" with lavash bread, so I didn't add any water. It also greatly reduced the cooking time!  I left the rest of the ingredients and ratios the same for the most part.  I cut the salt in half and used sour cream instead of yogurt (it's what I had on hand).  I also cubed the chicken and threw it in at the same time as the onion, etc, to avoid an extra step and further reduce the cooking time.  I slightly reduced the amount of oil, and it could have been further reduced to achieve the goal of sauteeing/browinging everything.  It came out really great, and the flavors were amazing thanks to this great recipe!

AMAZING. This recipe is so GOOD. I was cooking for two, so I used two chicken breasts, which weighed about 1 lb. But aside from that I made the full recipe, except I only used half the oil. I think if I was going to do the full two pounds of chicken breasts I would double the amounts of ingredients to make the sauce,  because the sauce is CRAZY good. Also, I cooked the chicken breasts whole and then I pulled them out of the sauce at the end, chopped them up a little, and then added them back into the pan for last couple of minutes. Served with rice and garlic naan. We could eat it every. single. day.

This is an amazing recipe!! It has a very authentic taste.  I recently made this for a large party of 45 people and everyone LOVED it!!   I am a busy mother of 4, so the only change I have made is that I usually double the sauce and add a deboned Sam's rotisserie chicken instead of searing off raw chicken...makes a quick delicious meal that even my pickiest kid loves.   We love spicy food, but when serving company, I usually cut the cayenne pepper in half.

What a delicious dish!!!!  I doubled the spices, with the exception of the cayenne pepper, which I, in fact, halved…otherwise, my kids would've taken one bite, screamed, and wouldn't dare eat another.  I didn't have the yogurt so I substituted with heavy cream and added some flour at the end to thicken it on up.  Totally forgot the lemon juice--but didn't seem to miss a beat.  The recipe was a total hit for our Sunday dinner and looked quite impressive.  Next time I plan on reducing the heat all the way down to low instead of medium, as after cooking for only 15 minutes, the chicken wasn't as moist as I'd like it--wasn't too dry but I'm sure it would've been if I would've let it cook for the full 20 as directed.  Overall a hit 5-star, A+ recipe that I will definitely repeat!!!!!

The whole family loved this chicken. The kids did not eat the sauce but that was ok because it left more for my husband and myself. We loved dipping hot bread in the sauce. Will keep this recipe handy.

Fabulous. I made it with tofu instead of chicken and left out the cilantro since I don't like it but otherwise made  it as written. Lived it and will make this again. BTW I used fat free yogurt for a virtually fat free recipe.

This recipe is sooo good!!! I followed it exactly the first time I made it although I didn't have turmeric on hand. It was still so delicious. The second time I didn't have yogurt on hand and I substituted coconut milk instead. I'll be making this recipe all the time. :) thank you!

This was so absolutely delicious...it passed the family test. Only changes I made was I used chicken stock instead of water and 3 tsp regular curry and 1 tsp of hot curry to give it a bit of warmth instead of cayenne. Also I used tomato paste instead of the crushed tomatoes. Such a great recipe to play around with...all the different spices were perfect!

This recipe is AMAZING. The husband LOVED it!!! I added an additional tablespoon of garlic and ginger, 3 whole chilies and I used Greek yogurt. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe and it was better than the curry we've had at our fav Indian spot. This will become a staple in our house!!

I tried this recipe tonight...followed directions and ingredients exactly.  Fabulous taste! I am somewhat disappointed that the yogurt seemed to curdle shortly after I added it, instead of mixing in smoothly with the sauce. I used a newly opened container of Fage Greek yogurt...anyone else have this happen? I'm thinking maybe it would be best to add the yogurt at the last minute and still a small amount of the sauce into the yogurt and then stir in just before serving.

My husband told me this was the best dinner I've ever made for him, and I like to cook a lot.  This is a very simple recipe and the sauce is not too heavy or fattening as it is just tomatoes and yogurt.  I think it would have been better if I had top quality yogurt on hand.  I stayed true to this recipe and would not change a thing!

Great recipe! I served this with basmati rice and sprinkled fresh cilantro on right before serving.

This is my first time ever eating or making curry chicken.  It was pretty easy! I cut up boneless chicken breast into cubes.  I had no garam masala or coriander and used ground ginger instead of fresh and sour cream instead of yogurt.  I totally forgot the lemon juice at the end, but it was pretty good!  I will make it again.

Loved the flavor. It looked great when I put in the yogurt , but it curdled really bad by the time I finished the cooking. I used Greek yogurt,  so maybe that's why.

I made this recipe and it was delicious!  I did use Greek yogurt and my only gripe was that it didn't want to totally breakdown, so it gave the dish a somewhat gritty texture so next time I may try traditional yogurt instead.  Overall, the flavors were amazing!

Challenging to make, this was worth the effort--it was crazy tasty!  I substituted the yogurt for heavy cream for a thinner sauce, better to mop up with naan with.  I will be serving this again.

I've made this twice.  I pretty much follow the recipe as-is, except that we prefer dark chicken so I use boneless thigh cuts, and we skip the cilantro.

It's good and easy.  It does require a well-stocked spice rack.  If you shop for spices at international markets, not big-box groceries, you can get much better prices.

Anyway, the recipe is a hit.

Amazing! One of THE BEST and most healthy curry recipes I have ever tasted! I love that this recipe doesn't call for cream! I used coconut oil as my cooking oil (so didn't need quite as much). The recipe is absolutely perfect! It's an amazing curry to do with veggies as well! I made a second batch without the cayenne for my kiddos!

I honestly couldn't believe that I made something in my kitchen that was as good, if not better, than what I've had out of the kitchens of authentic Indian restaurants! It is so, so good. Especially as leftovers, if there are any. I agree with other reviewers and cut the chicken into pieces. Other than that, don't change a thing! Perfect amount of heat. I also made a super easy naan bread to go along with it. 
This is a recipe to impress.

This was a really good recipe--the spice mix is very well blended. The one change I recommend is to cut the salt by 1/3 to 1/2--my husband and I thought it was definitely on the salty side. It would also be a good idea to cut back on the cayenne if you're feeding children--our 4-year-old loved it, and he probably would not have done well had I used a full teaspoon of pepper. On a different note, if you're the kind of person who likes to add more vegetables to saucy dishes like this, this one will take just about any mild veggie. I used okra, and it was a great addition.

Absolutely excellent as written. This hit all the tastes buds and was exactly what I was looking for. I used sour cream and 1/3 the cayenne because I can't handle more.

This was very good and similar to other Indian dishes I have made before. I followed the directions pretty well.  I did not have yogurt so I used sour cream. I added some peas and potatoes and it was delicious. Served this with onion parathas.

First time reviewer 'cause it was so good! I'm going to be one of "those people" who altered the recipe. My family loves a lot of 'soup'  with a meal like this so instead of adding a 1/2 cup water we added a full cup of chicken broth. We also used chicken thighs, which cuts down on the cook time I think. Other things we added:lots of chopped carrot(cooked w/onion mix) and extra cilantro. Could there be anything better than basmati rice to serve with this???  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe.  I used shrimp instead of chicken and added a few portabello mushrooms.  The flavor really pops in your mouth.  I served it with naan and basmati rice.  I also recommend measuring everything out in advance.

FIrst time using most of these ingredients, first time making indian food in general, and this stuff came out perfect! It literally tastes as good as anything I've ever ordered at a restaurant. And I am no cook! The recipe is just super easy to follow. This stuff is great.

We loved this!  I ended up not having cilantro so had to leave that out.  I switched out the water for a can of coconut milk, just to get rid of it and switched the crushed tomato for diced.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe faithfully - except for tossing in more curry powder (we like it a little spicy.)   It was simple to make and very flavorful.  Served it with basmati rice.  I can see where you could add vegetables to this if you wanted to in order to change it up a little and, of course, more or less spice to satisfy your personal tastes.  But for us there's no need.  It's a great little recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Adrienne!

Fantastic!  This dish has become a family favorite!  I only made a few minor changes.  I cut the chicken into one inch pieces, cut back on the amount of oil, and decreased the amount of salt to 2 teaspoons.  I've made it with and without the lemon juice, and it is delicious either way. I serve it over jasmine rice with warm naan bread.  Soooooo yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Im not a user of curry because a lot of curry dishes I have eaten have been too spicy.
I don't know if it was the yogurt or what it was but it was a creamy type of spicey. My family really like it.

OH yeah...this is definitely going into my curry recipe list. :) Changes I made: Omitted turmeric and cilantro (I was out of both), used coconut oil, Penzey's hot curry powder, canned tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes, coconut milk instead of yogurt, and bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks, which necessitated a longer cooking time (about 50 minutes). Added some chopped broccoli about 30 minutes in as well. Even with the changes, this came out pretty amazing, with authentic flavor plus a nice spicy kick. I'm very much looking forward to trying this again with all the correct ingredients!

Made this as the recipe is written (we didn't have garam masala, so we used the substitute mentioned in another comment).  It tasted exactly like a good Indian restaurant curry does and was very tasty.  Definitely a spicy curry.

Whoa! I can't believe that I made this in my kitchen! Great flavor, just enough heat w/o taking over the other spices. Only complaint is it has a bitter after taste that I wish I could eliminate.

Very happy with how this turned out! Followed instructions to a "T" except that I substituted yogurt for canned coconut milk and threw in 4 sliced thai chilis. Yum! Had it with some Basmati rice and it was a fab meal. Try it!

Really great tasting. Everyone enjoyed it, including my 5 yr old. I substituted sour cream for yogurt because I didn't have any. Definitely a keeper

I joined the site just so that I could give this recipe 5 stars.  It is absolutely delicious, and the best recipe I've found anywhere for homemade chicken curry.  I would not change one thing.  I have made it with my boyfriend a few times; I put him in charge of the spices and we have a nice stay-at-home date night.  I've also made it for dinner guests.  It is universally loved!  Healthy, too.  Thank you so much for sharing your excellent recipe with us!

Husband thought the chicken was a little dry. I loved it. i think the ratio of tomatoes to yogurt is perfect. The spice level was also on spot. neither too hot nor too mild.

This is the first time I have EVER attempted curry, but I stayed in India for 6 weeks and I served it to my sister in law who lived there for nearly a year.  It was the REAL DEAL!  She actually got emotional because of all of the memories of India it brought back!  It has just enough kick to be enjoyable and not uncomfortable.  I did not have curry powder, so I found recipes online for homemade curry powder and ended up just doubling the turmeric and added 1/4 teaspoon of ground mustard and 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom.  It was awesome.  I will go buy curry powder to see if it makes a difference.

this came out fantastic despite me screwing up the measurments as i was trying to reduce it down to a smaller yield.. i used half the oil (intentional).. used dried ginger.. doubled the curry and cumin (unintentional, but didn't mind it).. doubled the salt added to the tomato/yogurt mixture (unintentional.. GRR & DOH!).. used grated tomatoes instead of the can crushed tomatoes.. and everything else i did "right".. i added some thawed out frozen broccoli to help even out the salt.. and it came out really good.. i would like to make this the way it was intended someday.. but for now.. even w/everything i did wrong.. this dish somehow came out right.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: this time i followed the directions/ingredients closer to the original recipe.. only adding a bit more garlic and curry powder.. i finely chopped a small cauliflower and added a bit more water.. i'm very happy this came out great again.. i could see how the flavor could be further enhanced by using coconut milk but i'm happy with my results for now.. ty for the recipe

I tried this recipe for couple of times already within a month. My family and friends LOVE this. I add additional ingredients such as ketchup and honey. I also make this with vegetables for myself using broccoli, cauliflower, carrots...etc... they are really delicious!

Excellent recipe.  I always add a few whole cardamom, cloves, a cinnamon stick and some curry leaves.  In addition, when I add the onion, garlic and ginger I add a pablano pepper and at times a Serrano and jalapeno as well.

Delicious and extremely easy to make! I followed this recipe exactly and the only change I would make next time is less onion as I personally don't care for onions that much. It was flavorful, easy, relatively quick, and everyone in my family loved it. I don't have to order out anymore and I can make as much as I want!! Thank you for a new staple dish in my household.

It tastes better than the chicken curry I get at the local Indian spot in Connecticut.  I did not skimp on the ingredients (as an example whole milk yogurt instead of low fat), and tried to follow the recipe exactly.  The garam masala was difficult to find, luckily after hunting through 3 different stores I found a mccormick brand in Walmart.  

The one downside is that I made the mistake of pairing it with the bad naan I bought from the grocery store (the Stonefire brand - too dry), now I'm on the hunt for some good naan to pair with this delicious curry.  Good curry + Good Naan = Comfort food

I love this recipe.  I did make some "changes" but not many.  I have used Chicken Breast cut into 1 inch cubes and I've also used boneless skinless thighs cut into cubes.  My family loves Heat so I have used more of the pepper spices and added red pepper flakes to mine.  I also double or triple up on the ginger and I add it at the end so the flavor stands out more.  My entire family LOVES when I make this.  Its definitely worth making over and over again.

Delicious and super easy!  I cut my chicken up into pieces before cooking to speed it up and substituted cardamom and cinnamon for garam masala.  This is the second time I've made it and my roommates love it.

Turned out great! I used chicken thighs instead (I think they taste better, and are cheaper to boot) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Now I'm going to start experimenting!

Family loved it.  18 month old shoveled this in- of course I modified cayanne to taste.  I didn't make any other changes to this except dry cilantro- I'm sure fresh would really make a positive difference.  Very authentic tasting.  Made Nann bread and a pear roquefort salad and we were totally satisified.  My X came to pick up our daughter while I was cooking and I'm sure his nose buds were screaming!!!

This recipe was AMAZING!!! Made a nice meat to sauce ratio! (I love to have plenty of sauce to pour over the rice, or soak up with naan) I didn't have any ginger root so i just put in about 1/8 tsp of ground ginger to substitute it.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, have everything ready to go before you start cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

Really a 4.5 stars. I also cut the breasts into large chunks. It's the best at home curry I've made, and I've tried many, trying to get to that "what we got at the restaurant" taste. This wasn't quite "that restaurant" but it was  good. I did cut back on the final salt addition and my wife did say she thought it was still salty. I did about half the cayenne only because my 3.5 year old might have had a problem with this. He liked it just fine as I did it.
I bet adding some thigh meat as well would make this just that much better.
The chicken was a tad dry, but that's where the curry gets to do it's job.
I paired it with this: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/indian-style-basmati-rice/detail.aspx and it was a perfect combination. Only thing missing was naan.

Made this recipe with only one change, I didn't have the crushed tomatoes, so I used a small can of tomato sauce, and let me tell you, I will be making this again and again! It has wonderful flavor, texure and aroma.

We make this at least twice a month. I have 4 kids and they all love it. The only things I would point out is to adjust the pepper to your liking -I use approx. 1/3 of what the recipe calls for- and cut the chicken in smaller pieces. 

I have also made changes like adding raisins, or coconut cream.

Delicious! I love all the  spicy flavorings mixed together. Hot....so if you like it mild, reduce cayenne amount. The yogurt kind of separated as our cooked so I am wondering if anyone else had this happen? Maybe that's expected? If not does anyone know why that would happen?

Excellent, easy to make and really tasty! I used chicken tenderloins and just simmered them in the sauce at the end, which seemed to work well too. Be careful with the cayenne - I added it half tsp at a time to make sure not to overdo the spice!

The Curry turned out great. Unfortunately I did not have plain yogurt, and had to use sour cream instead. It tasted fine. I added another teaspoon of cayenne to spice it up, which made it almost too spicy! I used coconut milk instead of water. Thank you for such a great basic recipe! Hope you don't mind my adding my own touches.

Followed recipe exactly with the exception of the lemon juice at the end- didn't use it at all. My kids LOVED it but they are weird. They BEG us for Indian food, eat broccoli, etc! Hubby said it is 4.5 stars as it was very good- just not restaurant quality. We have an incredible Indian restaurant an hour from us so maybe the 4.5 isn't exactly fair. Will go into our recipe box!!!! Thank you to the contributor.

This was excellent, and very easy to make. I cut the chicken into cubes before I browned it. I also only used about 1/8 of a cup of oil and that was plenty. It was very very hot, but I like it that way! Served with basmati rice and roasted brussels sprouts. Everyone loved it!

Really good although you can put the chicken straight in after onions, spices and youghurt are all mixed in ... just put the chicken in and let it simmer on low/medium covered for 30 mins or so ... less time and work ... otherwise fantastic recipe

Delicious!! I added some birds eye chillis for extra heat. I also started by frying the onions, chilli, garlic & ginger until onion s were soft. I then added the spices and curry powder and stirred for a few minutes, then the chicken went in, then added the tomatoes, yogurt and water when the chicken had browned. Brought it to a boil then simmered for half and hour. Just before serving I added the garam masala, lemon juice and coriander. Made this for 9 people and they all loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was too spicy for our family.  I ended up putting some chopped oiled eggs until it wasn't too spicy any more.

My family LOVED this dish.  I made a few changes:

I chopped the chicken into bite size pieces and sautéed it with the onion, garlic and ginger in 2 T of olive oil.   I added everything else a let it simmer and served it over quinoa - and I also added a can of chick peas.    I did not use any lemon juice.   It was DELICIOUS!

Excellent! If you like Indian food this is the best recipe to date. I use two chicken breasts instead of 4 and pover over Mahanta rice, and use naan bread to sop it up.  I suggest buying naan from your super market (wal-mart, kroger, etc.) and warming it right before serving. Delicious...I never have any left.

I made this recipe with a few changes for dinner tonight, and it was delicious.  I substituted bone in chicken thighs for the breasts because I had them on hand, and I added about fifteen minutes to the cooking time.  I also substituted coconut milk for the yogurt. Again because I had it on hand.  To spice it up a little, I added about a tablespoon and a half of curry paste.  It was hard for me not to eat all six of the thighs.  It made a wonderful dinner.

Excellent!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 a cup of yoghurt and 1/2 a cup of coconut milk.  I also made it in the morning then refrigerated it to let all the spices blend. We ate on this for three days and it just kept getting better each time!

Almost the same recipe that my friend from India gave me. (problem is, they don't use any measurements!) However, with this one measurements don't have to be exact. I didn't have curry once and used masala seasoning instead. One thing I always change to this recipe is some type of veggie. If using potato make sure to fry them with the chicken, otherwise they will need to simmer for a very long time. Tonight I'm using green beans and peas, I've also used cauliflower (found a lot in Indian dishes). Fresh tomatoes are great as well. 

Last of all...BEST tip I've read on here...get your seasoning together before you start! Otherwise you will be running around like a crazy person! This is also a great recipe to make in twos! Makes the process faster and easier! 

Yummy recipe!

This recipe is amazing! I've never made Indian food and it turned out soo good, my family loved it!  I didn't have ginger, coriander seeds/powder, or garam masala but I'm wondering how much better it could have been with those ingredients.  And I also forgot to get Naan.  It's so spicy that you need some kind of bread with it, and Naan would have been perfect.  Def try this recipe!

I have never made Indian food before, having just discovered it at an Indian buffet.  I have made this recipe twice now, and made it exactly as written, and it is absolutely delicious.  My husband and I now count it among our favorite things!  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

Hadn't made Indian style curry in ages and don't care for corned beef w/cabbage so this is our St.Patrick's Day dish-to be toasted with Guinness,no doubt!
I also used boneless chicken breast and thighs,cut up before cooking.I also used half yoghurt and half cocoanut milk and used peeled fresh tomatoes.Cooked up nicely and tastes excellent in my opinoion!Thanks for the straightforward recipe'.

This is a great flavorful dish. I made the recipe with very few changes - I added more tomatoes (my can was bigger) and I didn't have any coriander on hand and I also used bone in chicken breasts. Still terrific. I'll definitely be making this one again. Thanks for sharing.

Best taste after you wait for about 5hrs after making to eat it. If you want this for dinner, make it in the morning or night before. I modified the cooking instructions: first I cooked the curry powder in oil for several minutes; then I added the other spices and onions, cooked until onions were translucent; added the chicken, salt, a little more oil and chicken broth when needed; then added everything else. Mine got watery so I added one tablespoon of flour/cold water mix in the bubbling pot. The yogurt and tomatoes made my dish a little more sour than desired; next time I will use less yogurt, more coconut milk, and drain some tomato juice out before adding to my pot. If you're lacking the "kick" or isn't flavorful, it's a matter of not having enough cayenne and chili powder, or not enough salt. Overall, delicious recipe. I made twice the amount yesterday for four ppl....this morning it's all gone!

I prepared this curry as specified.  I'll certainly make it again, but next time I'll tweak the recipe accordingly:  Cook over medium heat, not high or med/high as the spices & onions scorched.  Add cauliflower, parsnip or other veggie to make it more of a "one pot meal", cube chicken & marinate in a spiced yogurt brine before cooking in order to make it more flavorful.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever had.  The number of flavors you can taste along with an aftertaste of hot.  It's just so so good.  This recipe is going into my "best recipes of all time" book.

When I made this I have never once made any kind of Indian curry before and I was completely blown away!  My eight year old loved it and he doesn't usually like most things.  

I am so glad I found this recipe.  It is gold!!

This one is a winner, simple to prepare yet full with flavor and body, thanks a lot. I followed the recipe to a T, and the dish was just phenomenal. We eat a lot of Indian food to recognize good dishes, and this one's a keeper.

This dish was very easy, especially when I prepared all the ingredients before I started cooking.

I liked the taste, but I made it a little thicker because it was a little to watery for my liking.

Other than that, it was very flavourful...

Yum!  I just made this tonight and it was outstanding!  As one previous reviewer stated "its like a party in your mouth".  It was so full of flavor and a perfect meal for winter.  I had too much yogurt so I doubled all of the spices/seasonigs except for the salt, which I kept the same as stated in the recipe.  It was much hotter (from the cayenne) than I'm used to, but it was still amazing.  This one will be a regular in our recipe rotation.  Oh and the husband liked it too!

Wonderful dish! I added potatoes and diced zucchini and everyone loved it.  Next time I will make red rice to go with it, for all the wonderful sauce.

This is one good recipe...did it a couple weeks back and everyone enjoyed it. I coupled it with sweet sticky rice...I know weird but just loved the explosion of sweet rice and spicy chicken in my mouth. Wouldn't change a thing!

This recipe is fantastic! Even my picky 15-year-old loved it! Just a slight variation: I cut the chicken up into one inch pieces and added the lemon juice in step 3. I also used bunnyb's garam marsala recipe(see reviews). Great with a Taj Mahal beer!

My husband said we now no longer have to order Indian food... also that Gordon Ramsey would have approved! haha :)

It was a little too spicy for me (thank goodness for milk!!), but still VERY delicious poured over some nice rice. Definitely a do-again. Lots of leftovers for the week, too!

Perhaps reading all of the rave reviews set my hopes too high, but this recipe was not quite all I had thought it might be. It was good, but not amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the cayenne in half and is was still way too spicy for me. I was able to find the garam masala and tumeric at PCC in the bulk spice section and spent less than a dollar to get more than enough of both.

This is SOOO good! It has become one of my favorite dishes to make. It is easier to cook if you cut up the chicken into pieces before you cook it, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

Is okay.  I'm not a huge fan of Indian food but thought I would try it.  It does taste as good as any I've had in the UK.  It was easy to make and wasn't expensive.  Very filling.

Excellent curry.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and chopped the chicken breasts into large chunks - simmered for only 10 minutes.

My second time making this recipe. Super easy to follow and absolutely delicious!  I added extra spice (more cayenne) to kick it up a bit. I also chopped up the chicken breasts and included them in the curry. Delicious!!!

This is a very tasty and aromatic dish. The family greatly enjoyued it. I stuck to the recipe absent any changes. WARNING: Your home will smell like this for a couple of days. Re-heat any left-overs, same thing. This is a keeper.

Followed the recipe with a few exceptions.  Started with a clean skillet after browning the chicken.  There was a lot of liquid so I dumped it and put 1Tbsp. oil back in the pan before resuming the recipe;  Also used only 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper.  This is absolutely delicious!!

My first attempt at curry after my only visit to an Indian restaurant.  I made my own garam masala as I could not find it, but had to omit cardemom when making that since I couldn't find that either.  This was WAY spicy and made my nose run!  If making again, I'd scale down the cayenne.  But, it was otherwise tasty and I really enjoyed it served over rice (I did cube the chicken).

This is awesome if you love spicy indian food!! Very authentic tasting in my opinion. I agree you don't need the 1/2 cup of water. I added some carrots and potato as well. The dish takes a little more work than I like to spend when I've got two little kids running around while I'm cooking but the dish was soooo worth the effort!

This was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender. I didn't have any turmeric or garam masala but it still turned out wonderful. It's a keeper!

This was wonderful!  I didn't add the cayenne because I knew my kids would freak out if it was too spicy.  No matter...it was still delicious! Even my skeptical hubby liked it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very simple, yet excellent curry dish.  I ordered curry at a restaurant this weekend and this one matched it in quality.  Used less salt than the recipe called for, cut the chicken into cubes and served with rice.  It was delicious!!

I cut the chicken in cubes to ease eating and cooking, worked out great! I couldn't find crushed tomatoes so I used diced, still came out fabulous. After reading other reviews I cut out the half cup of water, glad I did since the tomatoes added enough liquid. I also used a substitute for garam masala since I didn't have any one hand (basically a mix of cinnamon, ground cloves, cumin, crushed bay leaves, etc that you can find if you google it) and it came out great! Excellent flavor and not too much spice or too overpowering. I ate it over rice and yummy! So glad I have leftovers!

This was the first curry dish I have made and I followed the recipe to a T. And it turned out excellent. It was delicious. Truly enjoyed this, and will use it again. You don't need to change a thing.

This was my first ever from scratch curry.  I just loved the fusion of flavors this recipe had, flavorsome with out being hot.  I did follow the recipe exactly, other than adding a few mushrooms (took no chances this first time) although next time I will admit the 1/2 cup of water, as it did make the curry to watery.  All in all an excellent meal.  My family loved it - Thank you for sharing.

MAKE THIS TONIGHT.  Not kidding, this is BETTER than the place we order Indian food from.  We actually substituted lamb just because we were feeling gutsy, but we followed the directions otherwise and it was just enough heat and completely deelish! Try it with some warm naan and basmati rice on the side.  Seriously, new favorite dish!

I thought it was really good my husband didn't like it! Our walmart and local grocery stores don't carry indian spices so I was only able to get Jamaican curry I have no idea if this is the same as indian curry! My husband thought there was too much onion and it is too soury! I on the other hand really like it... But next time, I will reduce the total amount of salt be 1 teaspoon and I will use less tomato...

This recipe is AWESOME!  It is definately spicy, so if you're not ready for a burn and kleenex on hand, you should tone down the spice.  My husband is not a curry flavor guy, but he loved this - its not over powering, a nice balance of flavors.  I served ours over Jasmine rice which made it perfect!

Awesome! I cook a lot of Indian dishes and must say this has to be one of the best yet.  VERY easy to make too (always a bonus). I used sour cream rather than yogurt, though this tends to make very little defence.  I also added a little more cilantro, yet again it's person preference.  Hubby loved it, always a good sign.  Beautiful flavour and colour, will defiantly be making this one again.

This dish was absolutely delish.  We served it with the carrot rice from this website and naan bread.  The only thing I added was some chopped potatoes when I added the onions.  I highly recommend this dish.  It's just as good if not better than any Indian restaurant.

Excellent Indian dish!  I cut the cayenne pepper in half because my kids won't eat anything spicy.  My 8 yr old ate it, but my 4 yr old thought it was still too spicy.  My wife and I loved it!  We just had leftovers for lunch and it was just as good reheated.

This curry recipe is really and truly outstanding!!  I was absolutely shocked that my children, particularly even my 11 year old son (who has a very discriminating pallet) loved it so much.  They and my husband were literally sopping up curry sauce.  It really was great!  Everybody actually wants me to make it again for a 2nd night!

Delicious.  Very flavorful and my Indian boyfriend loved it - said it's the best dish I've ever cooked (and I've cooked plenty).  I used 5-6 deboned large chicken thighs, 1/4 cup oil for browning (although I added a tbsp or 2 later), and halved the cayenne, as I just bought African cayenne which is quite hot (plus it, by far, controls the heat in this dish).  For tomatoes, I used fire-roasted tomatoes, which I will do so again in the future.  I boiled for ~35 minutes to ensure thorough cooking, and omitted the cilantro, as I am not a fan.  Make sure to have rice, naan, or bread available, as there is a lot of sauce (of course) with this curry.  Thanks so much for such an amazing recipe!

Delicious! I didn't have curry powder so put in 1 tbsp of cayenne & 1 tsp of chili powder in its place. I also added eggplant (minced), carrots, sliced cherry tomatoes (in addition to the canned ones) & served it with couscous. It is super spicy though, so be warned!

This was so good.  I had roasted some eggplant, small yukon potatoes, onions, red & green peppers and put the chicken curry over it.  That took the dish to a different level. I will definitely be making this again!
