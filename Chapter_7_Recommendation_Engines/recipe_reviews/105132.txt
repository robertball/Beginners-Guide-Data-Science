This recipe was a nice change of pace.  My husband and I did the Sonoma Diet in the winter and we decided to do a little detox week!  This was a perfect recipe because it made plenty and we were left feeling very full but the good full that comes after a healthy meal!  The only issue was my own fault...I used frozen (thawed) cooked shrimp and I didn't compensate the time.  The shrimp were a little overdone but the dish was still good.

This was Amazing!! I am only giving it 4'stars b/c I used tortellini instead of linguine and used veggies I had on hand. I filled my Biggest cast iron skillet with sauted garlic,onions, mushrooms,sliced peppers and veggies,veggies and the biggest shrimp I could afford! I found an Italian spice mix and added a good amount of butter along with a little Grapeseed oil. Heated it all up, made some Fab garlic bread and dinner was in the Bag! The family devoted it!!
