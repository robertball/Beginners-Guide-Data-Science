I made this and it turned out pretty well.  The only change was to use a brown rice/wild rice blend since we can't eat white rice any more.  My burgers were 4-5 ounces so I put two on the plate topped with the egg. I let my gravy get fairly thick and I only used 1 tsp of sugar. This is a good and filling meal.

I usually LOVE your recipes/videos. Sadly, I was disappointed with your rendition of Loco Moco. This Hawaii girl has NEVER had Loco Moco without lots of carmelized onions layered over the ground beef/fish/spam. The gravy was too salty without the addition of sweet carmelized onions to offset the saltiness.  I  think you took a simple dish and made it way mo complex than it has to be.  Come on over and I will make you real Loco Moco ;)

Absolutely amazing, I did however modify slightly.  I infused cara cara oranges and ginger into the rice.  Loved it!!

My son just recently realized he likes sunny-side up eggs.  So when I saw this recipe required sunny-side up eggs, on top of a burger, on top of a bed of rice... (ALL favorite foods)  .. It was a no brainer and we have a new addition to our menu.   

side note - I had leftover sauce and used it to sprinkle on top of some plain, sauted shrimp & veggies i had the following day for lunch - not bad!

As we sat down to eat I realized I forgot the ketchup. My hubby loved it anyway.  He said it was a definite keeper.  We love dishes with fried eggs.  The eggs brought this dish up from a 3-4 star to a 5 star dish.

We've made this a few times following the recipe exactly, it's great. We also made it with frozen hamburger patties and a packet of brown gravy and water in place of cornstarch and beef stock, not quite the same but still very good and saves some time.

I used liquid amino instead of soy sauce.
