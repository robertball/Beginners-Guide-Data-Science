Used dried cranberries and macadamia nuts, both left over from Christmas. OMG YUMMY! Thank you! I’m sure there’s more calories though, I added twice the amount of both, and a little more brioche, using a whole bag of brioche hot dog buns but it was worthit!

This sounds pretty easy and really good. I might try it with Hawaiian Rolls!
