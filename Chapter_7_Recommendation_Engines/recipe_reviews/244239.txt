This was almost like the cinnamon toast my mother made when I was a child umpteen years ago. I think my bread was what made it not quite what I remember. Also it was not quite sweet enough so next time I'll add a little more sugar.

Tastes just like the cinnamon/sugar toast I used to eat when I was a kid. I didn't note any difference in taste between coconut sugar and regular. Thanks for the recipe teenage chef! :-)
