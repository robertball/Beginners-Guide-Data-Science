I make this ALL the time.  I try to slice the potatoes as thinly as I can so none will be underdone.  I also use completely different seasonings: a dash of worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, seasoned salt, grated parmesan, or whatever I'm in the mood for!

My boyfriend and I loved this dish....very tasty. I like this recipe because it offers lots of options by changing vegetables and spices. The changes I made were rather simple....I added an entire sliced up zucchini an entire sliced up summer squash. Then I doubled the amount of spices and butter. Finally, there is no really no need to make individual pouches, just get a Reynold's Wrap Hot Bag and put it all in one. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the potatoes smaller so I could decrease the cooking time as the squash and zucchini cook quickly. I think next time I am going to throw some whole mushrooms in there as well and maybe some parmesan cheese. I can't wait!

Well, this gets an A for taste, but an F for presentation.  I had trouble with the potatoes sticking to the foil.  Maybe next time I'll try spraying the foil with cooking spray first.  I also left out the salt and it tasted great without it!

Very good basic recipe to tweak to your family's preferred taste.  I just shook the spices over the potatoes and onions, using much more than a pinch.  I also ended up cooking this dish for almost an hour.  Loved the flavor.

These were very tasty. I did use more than just a pinch of everything and I had fresh basil that needed used up but the combo of flavors was nice. I think a pinch is for playing it safe but you can easily add more of anything you like to suit your taste. Not sure about the other complaints because mine cooked up just fine in 30 minutes. If you cut them up thicker than the recipe calls for, well yeah they are going to take longer. These turned out just fine for us and were super simple.

Only used red potatoes, no onions - very tasty.
Next time I will try with zucchini.  I made on the grill.

Great on the barbeque with carrots.  I overcook it just a bit to bring out the really sweet taste.

My mom made these all the time when we were growing up. You can do whatever spices you prefer, simple is best though. I did bake my for 45min to 1 hr, using russets.

Adding some garlic powder gave it the kick it needed, and doubling up on the spices definitely made a huge difference flavor-wise. A very good and simple dish overall, next time I'll probably experiment with veggies~
