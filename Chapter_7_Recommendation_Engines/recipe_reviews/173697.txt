Perfect, perfect, perfect!  I can't believe with so few ingredients I've finally found what I was looking for - restaurant quality honey mustard sauce.  I love chicken fingers, but can never find a good honey mustard sauce in the grocery store - they all taste terrible.  I took a chance on this and am glad I did!

Delicious! I made this recipe at last minute to accompany sausage rolls. Although I didnt leave it overnight, it still tasted great!

Good, but let me make a recommendation. To speed this process up and eliminate the need for overnight refrigeration assemble the ingredients in reverse order and heat up the honey! Honey and lemon first. Microwave on high until honey/lemon is hot and very fluid. Then add mustard and mix. (I reversed the quantities. I like Dijon better, a personal thing) Then mayo and mix well. The residual heat from the honey ends with a slightly warm sauce, but without a 12 hour delay.

We’re well into Stone Crab Claw season here in SW Florida and these bad boys just cry out for a mustard dipping sauce.  There is another recipe on AR for this sauce that I’ve tried and loved but I was in the mood to experiment with something different.  Right off the bat I knew this one would be too sweet for our tastes so I reduced the honey by nearly half.  Still, Hubs found it a little sweet, tho’ I was fine with it.   My problem was that I found this a little heavy on the yellow mustard.  Not a bad sauce, but it would be much improved by reducing both the honey and the yellow mustard. Start out with small amounts of each. You can always add more, but you can’t take it out!

I tried this last night after refrigerating a few hours - and it was gross. Tasted like mayo & mustard (which reminds me of potato salad). After that initial tasting I added one more tbsp of honey. Just had some with leftover chicken and it was fantastic! Lesson learned - LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT!

I was making chicken strips and cottage fries for the grandkids. The oldest (7), Austin asked for honey mustard dipping sauce. So we hopped on AR for a quick simple recipe and this was just what we needed. I had almost ½ c. of mayo left in a qt jar so I added what we needed to make it and had Austin add the rest of the ingredients to the jar. Then he shook it for all he was worth for about 2 min. maybe 3. This was his review of your sauce JILLENA. Awesome!! Better then Mc D’s. Keep in mind how important McD’s is to a seven year old. Everyone for the 19 mo old to the 82 yr old liked it also.

Very nice balance of honey/mustard flavor.  I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used all yellow mustard.  I don't like to modify recipes the first time that I try them, but I don't keep Dijon on hand and wanted honey mustard with the chicken fingers I was making for dinner.  It was good when first made, but I agree with the observation that it improves overnight, so I would recommend that if you want the best flavor, make this a day ahead.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Amazing!  I have made this dip twice now for chicken wraps and my whole family loves it.  My husband doesn't even like mustard, but he loves this dip.  I made it exactly as written no changes.  We decided to marinade and baste some chicken with this dip as we were grilling.  It was awesome!

I have never liked the Honey Mustard you get in restaurants or fast food because it is so sweet but I made this for hubby and had to try it naturally and was this ever a pleasant surprise. If you like the real sweet honey mustard you may not care for this. I would say it is more of a Mustard Honey Dipping Sauce and it ROCKS! The mustard really comes through and could be a bit overpowering to some I suppose but it was perfect for us. Super simple and 5 stars all of the way!

This is the BEST Honey Mustard Sauce- We have to have this in the house as a staple for chicken nugget, pork chops, sandwiches, you name it my kids will use it! This is also the perfect sauce for "honey mustard melts" that I love. I had the melt at a restaurant and have made it it home, but never had the "right" sauce. Tried it w/this one... PERFECT I was exactly as I have ordered it at the restaurant! Thank you... I should post the "Honey Mustard Melt" on here huh! :)

I added more  dijon (approx 3T), more lemon juice (maybe about 2 T) and also more honey (4 T or so) and used this as a salad dressing.  Really good.  I've never added prepared yellow mustard, and was surprised to find it added what I was looking for - lots of flavor.  Thank you!

I love this stuff and it is so convenient! I do not use the dijon mustard, just replace it with the yellow mustard.

My kids love this! We’ve bought several store bought brands and my family only liked one. In the last year I’ve said Good Bye to shelf store bought brands and have starting only natural homemade dressing (Thank You All Recipes) but our favorite honey mustard was one I could not find a good replacement until this recipe, Perfect!!!

Orginaly rated in 8/16 Just what I was looking for to go with my oven baked crusted chicken tenders. This is going in my file. Update, I just wanted to say I make this all the time now. Family asks for it to dip stuff in or have as dressing. Easy and I have ingredients on hand! Today is 12/13/18 and I made this to dip those lil sausages in a blanket at our family party.

This is the best honey mustard sauce!  I do like mine a little sweeter, and so I decided to add another tablespoon of honey.  I used your recipe for mayonnaise too.  Wonderful!  No more store-brand honey mustard sauce and mayonnaise for me.  :-)  Thanks so much for sharing your recipes!

I ran out of my favorite honey mustard and really wanted some for dinner with chicken nuggets. I found this recipe and decided to give it a go since I had almost all the ingredients (I had no lemon juice but had lemon dijon mustard so I used that instead). It wasn't half bad. It was a little too sweet for me but good for how quick and easy it was to put together.

Delicious! I used a fat free plain greek yogurt in replace of the mayonnaise and it tasted perfect. After a night of chilling in the fridge, the dip tasted delectable with pretzels and my rutabaga fries. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is sooooooo good!  You definitely want to make it in advance, if you can, as it only gets better.  But if you in a pinch then it's great as we'll.

It was really good!  I was a littl bit leary of using so much yellow mustard, but dove in anyway. It's sooo good!

Very Good!  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, but it tasted great!  I reduced the mayonaise by 2 Tbsp., replaced the dijon mustard with prepared yellow mustard so that brought the recipe to using 3 Tbsp. of prepared mustard instead of 2 Tbsp., and I did not have lemon juice on hand.  It turned out GREAT!  It tasted like the restaurant honey mustard that is SO hard to find at the grocery store.

WOW! This is indeed a wonderful dip. Our meal was completed because of this sauce. However, I increased another tablespoon for my honey since the strong taste of the mustard overpowered the dip. And also, I refrigerate the sauce overnight. The taste of the dip next day is really perfect. Thanks for sharing this.

I made this exactly the way the recipe calls for.  I used Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard and fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  I let it chill overnight.  It was totally delicious.  Will make again and again.

In a word.....FANTASTIC!!! Thanks so much for this recipe. My husband and I both loved it. Used with home-made deep fried chicken fingers the first night and then fried shrimp the second night. This is a keeper! Made no changes.

Thought it was great.  I added some salt, pepper, and a clove of crushed garlic to give it some extra zing.  Would have been ok without but the consensus in the kitchen was that it could do with a little extra something.

Really easy to make, I used salad dressing as I didn't have mayo left. Turned out yummy, I like it a little sweeter so added a tad more honey. Tastes great, will leave in the fridge to set and serve with roasted sweet potato salad. mmmm

I guess it was just my family, but we didn't like this.  I followed the ingredients to a T, but the taste was too strong of the yellow mustard.  I questioned it when I saw the yellow mustard was double the Dijon, but went ahead anyway.  After a couple of bites, my gang got up and found the honey jar.  I would definitely try it again though, leaving the yellow mustard out.

It really is yummy! It was a last minute find, so I didn't let it chill very long and it was still really good. The person who compared this to Applebee's' is absolutely right!

This recipe was great! I am so in love with honey mustard so now that I have a staple recipe for it I will never have to buy prepared honey mustard from the store again. I made this sauce for another recipe I found here on this heaven sent website called Allrecipes. It was the Mini Crescent smokies and it was a hit! I didn't chill overnight and it was so good at room temp. I am most definitely make this sauce over and over again!

Easy to make and really tasty. I made just as the recipe was written. It actually improves with age and can be kept in the refrigerator for a long time.

Love it.  Used it on some sausage cheese rolls.  Like one other reviewer, I added a little cayenne for kick.  Second time I made, I didn't have any lemon juice so used same amount of vinegar and it came out just as good.  Thanks.
Second review:  Still love this stuff.  Tried with 1/4 tsp. dry mustard mixed first with the mayo to blend then added and mixed rest of ingredients. Even better as everyone said.

This is amazing!  It was my first time making my own dipping sauce and I was not disappointed.  I agree with what another reviewer had said; it does taste similar to Applebees honey mustard.  I did not and would not change a thing with this recipe!

I have to admit, I didn't have Dijon so I improvised. I replaced the Dijon with regular mustard and it turned out to be too much, so I added more lemon and honey. The end result was good!

This was a very yummy sauce!  I made it as is and it was just as good as any honey mustard you would find at expensive restaurants.  Add a dash of garlic powder to give it a little something extra.  It is great!

We really enjoyed this sauce.  I changed the Yellow mustard to 1 tablespoon and the Dijon to 2 tablespoons.  (We both prefer the Dijon flavor more).  As suggested by another user, I also reversed the addition of all the ingredients and heated the lemon & honey prior to the addition of any other items. I heated the honey & lemon juice together on High in the microwave for 1 minute.   I needed to make this in a hurry & it worked perfectly!  Great flavor and very easy to prepare.

This happens to be one of the best honey mustard dipping sauce I have ever tried. It has a very mellow mustard and honey taste. The fresh lemon juice brings out every flavor of this sauce. I made it exactly as listed. Making any changes to this sauce is not necessary.

Delicious and super easy. I followed advice and i heated honey and lemon juice in microwave first for about 20 seconds.Then added mustards and mayo. No need to refrigerate first, its great slightly warm. I didnt measure anything. Just tried to make the amout i needed. The yellow mustard is great to make sauce a pleasant color and a little more dimension to the flavors. Took about 1 minute to make!!

First time making it and it was really tasty. Even tho I added bit too much mustard by accident. Made extra, stored it in the freezer. Will definitely make again. Super easy too, always  a plus.

This recipe came out perfect! I'm actually using it as a chicken marinade (I'm making chicken strips marinated in honey mustard than rolled in crushed pretzels) and the flavor is great! Can't wait to taste the finished product!

This recipe is probably the best honey mustard sauce recipe I have found it is the closest consistency to Logan's roadhouse honey mustard sauce except that do not use Dijon mustard I supplement it with regular mustard using three tablespoons instead of two. And the taste just improves the longer it stays in the icebox

Made 1/2 size of this recipe two days ago to test it with grilled chicken breast. 
I didn't have Dijon, so I substituted with Safeway Stone Ground Horseradish mustard. No time to refrigerate, but it was still super delicious. So yummy that I made more last night to dip the chilled leftovers in. Would be great as a sandwich spread too. I am certain I will be making this often. Thanks so much!

Love this honey mustard!!! It's the closest recipe I have found so far to Lee's Famous Recipe honey mustard:) My son and I dip pretzel sticks in it, and I can't wait to actually make some chicken strips to dip in it!

Perfect accompniment to my favorite grilled chicken, mushroom and sauted onion sandwich.  Tastes like the sandwich at the famous pie resturant that I order every time I go there.  Thank you so much Jillena!

I never liked any honey mustard sauce with chicken fingers when going out to eat but this WOW!!!! I was asked to bring honey mustard sauce to a cookout and I couldn't find any at the store so I whipped this up.  I couldn't stay out of it.  Now I make a batch and use it on my sandwiches during the week.

My son just asked if we had any honey mustard, I had all of the ingredients on hand.  He said enthusiastically that this is the best honey mustard he's ever had - he said it's awesome.  I served it immediately, so we can only imagine what it would taste like after sitting overnight!

I followed this recipe exactly as written(maybe I added a squirt of extra honey because I love it)! I made chicken tenders for dinner and we all loved this sauce. Fantastic and so easy!

I have tested many recipes & purchased several from the grocery store & none were as good as this.  Reminds me of Auntie Anne's Honey Mustard Sauce for dipping pretzels & Outback's sauce for their Alice Spring's Chicken.  So good!!!!

I've never liked honey mustard but thought I'd give it a try based on the reviews.. And to my surprise I loved it!  I served this with baked chicken parm nuggets from this site, so good! And even when we bring home chicken from takeout, my husband wants this homeade sauce now instead of the restaurant honey mustard.  It's still good if u don't have time to let it chill in fridge, but I like it best if it's chilled at least a few hours.

Made this to go with pigs-in-a-blanket (Piggy Wiggys on this site) and it was perfect! Added a dash of ground cayenne to give it a kick. Besides that, followed recipe as written. Will use this for lots of apps and other dippers!

This was a delicious honey mustard.  I didn't change a thing (very unusual for me *grin*).  Someone said that it was too sweet and to start with 1 T honey, I found the 2 T honey to be just right.  The addition of the lemon juice really brigtens it up too!

Im not a mayo person at all... was very iffy about making this sauce but i decided to give it a shot after seeing all the positive reviews and im glad i did make it.  It was a great sauce to go to with the brown sugar smokies.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and heated up the honey and lemon juice before i mixed everything else in.

Great recipe, the only change that I made was that I did not refrigerate the mixture for 8 hours as suggested. Instead I whisked the mixture vigorously and then stored it in the freezer (while I was preparing some Southwester Egg Rolls a recipe also found on this site) for about 15 minutes and then I brought out the mixture and whisked it vigorously again for about 1 minute and then served it. Also another option is to substitute Coarse Stone Ground Dijon mustard instead of regular Dijon mustard to add texture. 

My family thought it was great! Especially my son the picky eater!

This is NEARLY spot-on to what you find at a restaurant! I have been searching for a while to find one that matches perfect. You won't find this in your local grocery store. I give it a 4.5 (just short of a 5 star) based on the following: Only thing with my taste preferences- too much honey in this recipe! Start with 1 Tbsp! I found I had to add more mustard(s) & mayo to keep it from being TOO sweet. I'd say this is an absolute keeper- just start with 1 Tbsp. of honey & add more as needed for desired taste. THANK YOU!!! I am SO happy to have found the recipe for my favorite dipping sauce! :)

This is by far the best homemade honey mustard sauce that I have made. This time I didn't have enough mayo so I used some Miracle Whip as well. It still was excellent.

fabulous recipe ...this is very close to the oriental chicken salad dressing at a chain restaurant.  I might try adding a few drops of sesame oil to give a little more depth of flavor. Folks won't quite know what the taste is, but it's a good-thing!

I keep some of this in the fridge at all times. It's good the day you make it, but it really is better the next day. I usually add a little more yellow mustard to it because we prefer it that way.

My 16 year old daughter is a honey mustard freak. She dips everything into honey mustard... even pizza. This is her favorite. It's so good, she told a local restaurant owner about it and now he wants me to bring some in so he can add it to a couple of his sandwiches.

Made this with 1 TBSP Jack Daniels mustard, 2 TBSP brown spicy mustard and fat free mayo because that is what I had on hand. It was very yummy. The kids loved it. With the fat free mayo, I had to stir it a lot. Next time, I will use the blender or food processor because the fat free mayo gets chunky. Otherwise, this one is a keeper for chicken tenders on family night.

I made this for my son and it tastes similar to McDonalds dip. I would prefer a little kick to mine to liven it up. I will be adding some cayenne or New Orleans seasoning to it.

Thank you so much! This was a BIG hit at mu book club - I served it with sourdough pretzels. I'll be serving the leftovers to my family with chicken strips. I'll never buy honey mustard again!

This was amazing. I started with Maille's Dijon honey mustard and added yellow mustard then followed the rest of the recipe as is. I did add a bit more honey but this is personal preference. My husband, who normally doesn't like mustard, loved this recipe. We used it as a dressing for salad and also for the Buffalo chicken fingers recipe from this site so the sauce is actually a dressing that tastes good with everything! This is definitely a 5-star keeper and repeater on my roster! I am using recipes on this site to train my helper to cook Western dishes, as she has only cooked Asian food in the past and even she really liked the dressing. Thanks do much!

This recipe is tops!!  I use it with the Mini Crescent Dogs, Green Bean Fries and Blooming Onion recipes from this site.  Even plain french fries go well with it.  It's great on ham sandwiches too!  Definitely make it a day ahead to let the flavors meld.  I've got a "honey tooth" so I added another Tbls. of honey just for my taste.  Thanks Jillena!

Good stuff!  I make this all the time.  The only change I make is to use reduced fat mayo (you can't tell the difference).  The lemon juice makes it a bit runny when you first mix it so I really would recommend making it at least a few hours before you are going to use it.  It helps it thicken.

Very tasty!  Didn't have dijon so used spicy brown and added about 1 tbls (double batch) hot honey mustard I had on hand.  Gave it just a tiny kick.

Ok, kinda funny all the raves for honey mustard dip sauce, but...it was very good. I halved the recipe but did equal amounts of both mustards (2 heaping tsp each). Used only 1/2 tsp lemon juice but the full tbslp of honey. I added 1/4 tsp of white pepper. After 3 hours it tasted just fine to me. I'll try it again tomorrow & see if it's even better. Thanks for the simple yet tasty recipe.

I was making the "gold fever chicken wing sauce" when I realized I was out of honey mustard.  Came across this and thought why not try it.  I used "light" real mayo and it came out perfect.

I've always hated honey mustard sauce since I've tried it at a restaurant but I did make this for the bf because he loves anything honey-mustard. I was curious about the flavor so when I did try it, I really enjoyed it. This would be the ONLY honey mustard sauce that I would go for.Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is a really delicious honey mustard sauce. My kids are huge fans of honey mustard and it is really hard to find a good one in the store. The only thing I changed to suit our preference is that I added only 1 tbsp of yellow mustard. I also always double the recipe because we love it that much! Thanks for the recipe!

I always try to follow the recipe just as written the first time I make it but I didn't have dijon mustard only spicy brown. The spicy brown made it just a little too "mustardy" for me so I added just a tad bit more honey and maybe 1/2 tsp. corn syrup and it balanced out really well. 

My husband loved it also. Next time I will make it with the dijon and I'm sure it won't need the added corn syrup and honey. Thanks for sharing!

I don't like dijon, so I made it without, and it tastes EXACTLY like the REALLY GOOD honey mustard sauce you get at restaurants.  No more bottled honey mustard for me!  I could never find one that tasted like a restaurants' anyway.  This is SO good!!  You won't be disappointed!  P.S.  I never refrigerate overnight, still is outstanding.

I am not a fan of mustard at all, but my son is.  So on the reviews, I tried this recipe and it is resturant quality!  Had spicy mustard instead of yellow, but outstanding!  I actually like it & have had it on my own sandwich!

Needed a quick dip for chicken fingers.  Did not let it sit overnight but was very good. Will definitely make again.  Did not have Dijon mustard so substituted Herlochers which is a sweeter dipping mustard.  Worked just fine.

Excellent dipping sauce.. better than any honey mustard sauce in a jar I have bought... I didn't have any honey Dijon mustard nor did I refrigerate the sauce overnight... I just used 3 tablespoons of yellow mustard, mixed it right up and it came out great!

Hey everyone!  I posted this recipe and I really appreciate all the kind comments.  My husband found a new Dijon mustard call Mr. Mustard that he loves. I made some honey mustard tonight using the Mr. Mustard and it was scrumptious.  Normally I would use Golden's Dijon Mustard.  If you can find Mr. Mustard in your area, I would suggest using it.  Thanks again!

I don't eat honey mustard, but everyone that I made it for loved this recipe!  I also added a little more honey and also a few pinches of sugar.  I stuck it in the freezer so that it could cool quicker and it was delicious!

Delicious! I added a small amount of Sriracha to it ( just a squirt) and that made it even better.. It really does need overnight refrigeration,  Served it with fried chicken wings.

The only reason I made this was because I was to lazy to go to the store and actually buy some real honey mustard. In the end, I was actually very glad I chose to make this because it turned out to be better than what I usually by at the store. 
Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Absolutely delicious!!!! Only thing i would have done differently is to stir or cream the mayo first before adding in other ingredients. It came out lumpy because of the mayo but it was still delicious and I will definitely make it again!! So easy!!

Delicious and simple. I made it exactly according to the recipe the first time and absolutely loved it, but the second time, I didn't have lemon juice, and left it out; turned out fine. I also swapped the quantities for the mustard, because I really like dijon mustard. I made it again last night and added paprika, and that was an EXCELLENT addition, giving it an extra little smoky bite. Overall, it's been excellent each time I've made it, from the first time to the most recent. It's not as sweet as store-bought honey mustard, and none of the ingredients overpower the others. I always have a jar of this in my fridge.

I thought this sauce was great. The only thing I did was add an extra squirt of honey. It was great with chicken fingers, and I think it would even make a good salad dressing.

Amazing....I am not a fan of mustard but have been looking to find the closest recipe for the honey mustard dressing similar to Famous Anthony's and this is it!  I did decrease the regular mustard by a little bit but did everything else exactly and it was awesome!!  If you let it sit a day the flavors blend so well and is just divine!  Thanks so much for posting!!

I made it pretty much exactly as instructed, though I happened to have a Meyer lemon on hand instead of a regular one for the lemon juice, and I did not let it sit over night.  I found this recipe  when I needed it for dinner tonight, so letting it sit that long was not an option.   I ended up letting it sit in the refrigerator about an hour to get chilled.   It came out perfect anyway.  It was the exact honey mustard flavor I was looking for.

Great honey mustard recipe!  I added an extra Tablespoon of Honey, we all liked it better that way.  Delicious!  The second time I made this recipe, I tried a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of paprika and it was even better.  Love it - this is the recipe I will be using from now on.

Great dipping sauce!
I did however change the amounts of the mustards. We prefer a more dijon tasting honey mustard dip. I used 2 T dijon mustard and only 1 T yellow mustard. We like the amount of honey it calls for. Using only 1 tbsp (as some reviewers wrote) was not as tasty to us. But if you're particular about the sweetness I would start with 1 Tbsp and work up from there.

I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used a teaspoon of dry mustard.  It worked!  I will make anytime I need a honey mustard dressing.

I added 1-1.5 tbls of Silver Valley Beer n' Brat Mustard (or substitute spicy mustard of choice) to bring the recipe to 5 STARS.  Adds a little zing to an otherwise mellow honey mustard sauce.  It would be pleasant on a salad but not something to dip wings in.

Made this last minute with homemade chicken nuggets. I don't like mustard and I don't like mayo, but I love honey mustard and this is exactly what I was wanting. I did add an extra tablespoon of honey. Didn't refrigerate, either. Ate it when dinner was done and it was still excellent. Thanks!

Look no further then this recipe, I made it exactly as published. I will never buy a store bought one again. The only thing I I will  add is to make it and use it at least 2 days later it gets better as all the flavors meld together. Next batch I might add a little heat to it but the original is superb as is.

I thought it needed a touch more honey and I swapped the amounts on the yellow and dijon mustards since I prefer dijon.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very simple, very easy.   And I mostly use it on my vegetable/grain salads (adding a little more lemon juice).  A little goes a long way, but then I don't like my salads swimming in dressing.  Toss well.  Yummy!

This recipe is great as is, but I buy low-fat mayonnaise which doesn't work as well as the full fat version for these types of recipes. To counteract this I add a little less mayo and a little extra of each mustard.

I will never buy store bought honey mustard sauce again! This was perfect. No need to adjust the measurements, they are perfect just the way the are. I didn't want to wait overnight to use the sauce so I did change the method a bit. I used the suggestion of another review and heated the honey and lemon juice in the microwave before adding the other ingredients. It came out perfect. Will definitely make again, and again, and again!!!! Thanks a lot!

I made this for our Christmas Eve Fondue as a dip for chicken.  It was delicious for the pork tenderloin we served as well.   It is a lovely blend of mustard and honey, neither flavour was overpowering which I find mustard can sometimes be in recipes.  I love the creaminess the mayo adds to the recipe as well.  

Don't be afraid to make this just before you need it either...the recipe indicates to make it ahead but I made it at the last minute and it was still very good.  We refrigerated the leftovers and had some more of the sauce a couple of days later the flavours had blended more (and it was all the more yummy) but it was still good with being made at the last minute.  

I am definitely making this again.

Wow! Delicious! I am pleasantly surprised with this honey mustard, just like the others said, store bought just doesn't cut it! I used raw honey,  plocmans mild yellow mustard, kroger brand dijon mustard, and hellmans mayo. I suggest adding in one tablespoon of honey to start just to see if that is sweet enough for you. This recipe is perfection!

This sauce is awesome! Tastes a lot like my favorite honey mustard dipping sauce from PDQ chicken restaurant. I did like another reviewer suggested & mixed the lemon & honey 1st & warming them to more liquid consistency, then added everything backwards with mayo last (I used light mayo) & it was tasty right away. Chilled for a couple hours & it was ready to use.

Most store bought  prepared honey mustards don't even contain honey and usually just have tons of corn syrup so I prefer to whip up my own.This was simple and delish! I doubled the dijon for more zing.

Tastes fantastic by itself, it is my go-to dipping sauce. Best of all, It is so easy and cheap to make that it lends itself to playful experimentation without all the disappointment if your concoction turns out terrible!

Great sauce! I heated up the honey first and then added the other ingredients. I used the sauce as a marinade and as a dip. I cut chicken breasts into strips and covered them in half the sauce for an hour. Then I coated the chicken in crushed pretzels and pan fried. We used the rest of the sauce as a dip. Very good!!

Restaurant quality. It does have to set about 24 hours before it tastes right, but it is so right. It keeps for a long time, too.

Excellent! I had it with the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken from this site, and the sauce was the star! Will go great with chicken nuggets, crabcakes, just about anything you can think of. Why look further when you have found the best? UPDATE: Made to go on a turkey wrap and later, some kielbasa. This is great!

This is a really good dipping sauce!  I didn't have Dijon so I increased the yellow mustard and added a little more honey as I prefer a sweet dipping sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was a little nervous since I did not have honey, but substituted Agave and it was still yummy!!  My three year old son helped me make it and it was perfect for our oven baked chicken tenders (we ate it right away).  Thanks!!

The results of following the recipe exactly was VERY good but preferring it a little sweeter I gave 1 tbsp more of honey than the recipe called for and, for us, it was perfect. A keeper for sure.

This is the best honey mustard sauce I've ever tasted! It is better than any restaurant and you can make it in no time at all! I followed the directions exactly and put it in a ziplock baggie to sit over night. Made some fried chicken tonight and then had to write about the sauce on Facebook! Haha :) thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did not have the onions so I did not add them but I thought it was perfect without them. I have always been kind of picky about honey mustard sauce and this one is exactly what i have been looking for. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't care for this.  I had a feeling the yellow mustard was going to be overpowering and it was. In retrospect I would probably have used 2 1/2 T of Dijon and 1/2 T of yellow.  All I tasted was mustard. In fairness I did use a reduced fat mayo, so that may have contributed to the problem.  In the end, it just didn't have the taste I was going for.

Tastes exactly like the dipping sauce we get at a local resturant. Delicious! I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used regular mustard and it still turned out yummy.

This honey mustard is unbelievably delicious!  I'm so picky about honey mustard and this recipe is spot-on.  I was a little leary about the mayonnaise part but it is absolutely perfect!  I'll never buy honey mustard again.

I made this as a dip for homemade pretzels. So easy, and so delicious...just like the honey mustard you get at a restaurant. The only change I made was to add a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper at the end.

Fantastic! I can never find a store bought honey mustard that tastes anything like the sauce you can get at restaurants. Like another reviewer said, this turns out great even if you don't have the Dijon. I've even used this to make subpar store bought honey mustard delicious.

This is the honey mustard sauce that for which I've been looking for over 20 years!  It tastes just like the first honey mustard sauce I ever had at a John's Garage in Illinois.  I've tried various recipes and concoctions of my own and just never got it right.  Yours is THE ONE!  Thank you so much, Jillena!

Both of us really enjoyed this, it has a perfect blend of creamy and acidic and sweet and salty that is a great combination with anything you chose to dip. ( We've tried it with both steak fingers and chicken nuggets).

My husband absolutely loved this! As he was dipping his chicken into it, a little dripped onto the table and he actually leaned over to lick it up! I about died of shock!!!! Needless to say, he begged me to make it again!

Outstanding, use red tai chili paste instead of honey if you want more kick with the sweet.

This is really awesome tasting and easy to make.  I put all the ingredients in a bowl and my 5-yr-old mixed it up.  She tasted it and dubbed herself an "amazing chef!"    This would make a great dressing for a Fried Chicken Salad.  Yum!

This sauce was great.  I was in the mood for honey mustard and didn't have a bottle of it.  Heck, I'll never buy bottled honey mustard again.  I used 3 tablespoons of yellow mustard because I didn't have any dijon, but it would have been good either way.  I'll use this again for sure.

I can't believe how a few simple ingredients combined could be so outstanding.  This was one of the best recipes I have ever made from this site.  I also whipped it up right before dinner, and it was great without being chilled overnight.

This was awesome with Fried chicken! Made it about 30 minutes before dinner was served and let it cool in fridge. Grandaughter and hubby loved it, too. Didn't have regular prepared mustard so I substituted 1 tablespoon of ground mustard. Excellent!

Very good and easy. This is like your favorite restaurant honey mustard sauce. I would agree with other reviewers that it is better with additional honey. I didn't know what to think of the mayo, but it softens the zesty flavor of the mustard. Wonderful!

This dipping sauce has a good flavor. I have dipped baked chicken in it and I like the results. The sauce takes mayonnaise so possible I will try another sauce with this fatty ingredient next time. I did not know that a honey mustard dipping sauce has mayonnaise so I will check stuff out some more. Yum.

Five stars, but with a major modification: Done entirely in error, but the results were incredible. My husband was helping me in the kitchen and I tasked him with making this sauce for our Chicken Strips dinner. In error, he used 2 tablespoons of our good quality DRY mustard (mustard powder) instead of using prepared yellow mustard like the recipe states. No other changes were made. It was hands-down the best mustard dipping sauce I have ever tasted.

I used mayo mustard mix instead of just the yellow mustard . Super easy to make and I will be making it again.

I probably would put a little more mustard and honey in it. It was not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was good.

This is a great recipe for honey mustard sauce ... we've eaten it following the recipe exactly but lately I've found that adding a TBSP of BBQ sauce makes it insanely delicious... close to Chick filet sauce...so amazing

I'm such a fan of this sauce. I usually have it when I'm eating chicken nuggets or regular fries. I can comfortably say it's better than what's out there in restaurants; the home-made enjoyment is in every bite, and I will always go with this particular recipe. Thank you!

Loved it. Easy simple recipe that can be  modified to highlight flavors since there are only four ingredients. Recipe is great. I'm varying measures to see if I like it with different levels of sweet tangy or mustard.  For me it's win win win.

I'm not a big mustard person, but this was good.  It was really good with the chicken I had made too.  I may use a little more dijon mustard vs yellow next time, and maybe a little more honey.  I definitely had the mustard flavor but think I want to try with a little more sweetness too.

Very good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I reduced the prepared mustard slightly and increased the honey slightly but overall a great recipe and very easy to make.

Tastes just like my favorite honey mustard (Ken's). Made this when I was out of honey mustard but had all the other ingredients- except dijon mustard, but I substituted with about 1/2 tbsp spicy brown mustard. I was kind of in a hurry so i didn't fully read the recipe, so i used it as a dipping sauce immediately after mixing it and it was just fine! All my ingredients came from the fridge except the honey so it was chilled already. Also it's just a bit liquidy but I don't mind that since the taste is perfect

The best honey mustard and its very easy to tweak to your liking. I always add a bit more honey because we like ours more on the sweet side.  I always serve this with ham and cheese Stromboli. Thanks!

This honey mustard sauce is delicious and usually I don't like mustard. I'll be making it the third time tomorrow to go with Best and Easiest Chicken Nuggets and Oven Fried Potatoes II. Have some coleslaw on the side and this meal rocks!

I'm so glad I read the reviews first. I needed a last minuet dipping sauce and was about to move on when I read Erin A. M. Spharler's  recommendation to reverse the order and heat the honey and lemon first. This worked really well and the taste was great immediately, no need to refrigerate overnight!   I did adjust the amount of honey and dijon mustard to my taste and I also only had miracle whip so I used less to counter the sweetness. Couple of hours later the taste was even better. Super quick and easy will not be buying store brands any more!

Made this today just out of curiosity. We have a honey mustard connoisseur in the family and I thought I'd see if she liked it. Made it exactly as listed in the recipe and used all name brand ingredients which I think makes a difference. My connoisseur granddaughter tried it and she said it is awesome so that is a big compliment. Will definitely keep it in the fridge. I think this would be good with anything that is dippable!

Excellent as is.  I followed the recie exactly.  For those that prefer a bit more "bite" or spice just know that this is a very mild sauce (perfect for me).

I decide to make a quick, easy, last minute  sauce for my chicken thighs. I decided upon this type of sauce. I did not have all the ingredients (lemons), but it still taste great!

I made this last night (glad I read to make it the day before!) and used it today at lunch for my homemade chicken tenders and WOW I do believe this is the best honey mustard sauce I've ever had! This one is a keeper and I'm not changing a thing! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I wanted honey mustard -- this is honey mayo.  Not nearly enough mustard kick, even after adding more yellow and more dijon.  I'm going back to my old recipe -- honey and mustard!

I made it but altered because we are not able to eat the sweet honey.  I used half a syringe of stevia.  24 hours later it was perfect.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I think next time I will leave out the lemon juice. It made it too runny and tart. I added a little more honey to compensate.

Perfect the way it is! (I just don’t like honey mustard in general) I added 1/4 cup of honey in order to make it a bit more palatable for my personal preference. I also added some paprika for color as well as cayenne for some spice! Thank you for sharing!! My husband loves honey mustard! The things we do for love.

A bit to much mayo flavor for us.  Doubled the Grey Poupon and tripled (at least 3x) the honey.  Gave it four stars because it is a good starting point - just need to customize to your family's taste.

This sauce is excellent!!! While taking a taste test, I inadvertently used a spoon that had a bit of peanut butter on it. And the two flavours together was even better. I added about two tablespoons of peanut butter and some coconut oil to thicken it up a bit. I think a bit more of the oil will help to congeal it a bit more. So I give this recipe an 10 star rating.
I'm looking for a healthy substitute for butter/margarine; spreadable.

Yum yum yummy indeed. I am now slathering this on everything! I also made egg salad and used this instead of my regular mayo/mustard combo. Delish. Here's a question though- how long will it keep in the fridge? I don't think there is anything perishable in it.

I had to make this recipe twice to reduce the ingredients. I got it just right the second time. I thought it was great on salad then I tried it with chicken strips. Great tasting and multi purpose dipping and salad dressing. This will go in my family recipe book and I will take credit for it....I did tweek this recipe to my taste??

Excellent! It's definitely better after sitting overnight though. Delicious with chicken fingers.

My family loved this dipping sauce!!!! The only change I made was I added a little more honey.  Although it didn't need it, but my family likes honey mustard to be a little sweeter.  I will absolutely make this again.YUMMY!!!!!

This was super good!  I made it late one night for a pretzel dip.  It never had a chance to sit overnight, but it was delicious!  Now I know the secret ingredient to a good honey mustard dip - mayo! :0)

soo good! I'll admit that I don't measure but I made this recipe pretty much to code and it turned out great. Perfect blend of flavours, I think the lemon is what I was always missing before I tried this recipe.

Really easy and tasty. We only have Dijon so that's all I used. Found it a wee bit sweet so added a little regular white vinegar. Will cut back on the honey just a little the next time. Definitely a keeper.

There is no need for the Dijon or the lemon juice in my opinion.  We loved it without!  It is identical to the same served at restaurants.
Sorry - never been a fan of Dijon!

Delicious, but could use a little more "kick".  I think a little extra brown mustard would make it better.

Excellent!  I used half reg mustard and half spicey brown. Just the right mixture for me,replacing the baby rays honey mustard dip that was nasty and went in the trash after one taste. .  I should have known that there would be a great recipe here.  Thanks for sharing.

It was okay.  Seemed to be missing something and was a little one-dimensional.  Maybe I'll try again and add some dry mustard as well or a little hot sauce or horseradish to give a little more oomph.

We use this as a dressing for salad with a bit less mayo. I use lemon, or ACV, to thin it out.
One of the easiest recipes and helps us to eat more salad.

Very good easy sauce. I used dry mustard instead of the yellow, it gave the sauce more of a tangy flavor. I did not have time to refrigerate, but I thought it turned out great

This was very good served along side chicken fingers. I made a few substitutions though. I dont like yellow mustard, so i used 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard instead with 2 tablespoons dijon mustard. Otherwise i followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious.

Very good!!  I used this as a dipping sauce for Baked Coconut Shrimp, also from this site.  I made the recipe as instructed, but I used cider vinegar, as I didn’t have any lemon juice, which worked well.  I may try using my leftovers as a basting sauce for grilled chicken.  YUM!

Perfect perfect even without the dijon mustard.   I used a whisk because I had to serve it tonight and it's all gone.   I'll try to make it early and refrigerate it the next time.  Thanks.

DELICIOUS!!  I made this tonight to dip our chicken strips in, and it was great!  I didn't have any lemon juice and it still had a wonderful flavor.  Thanks!!  I will be making this again :)

This was a real hit with my husband and 1.5 year old nephew!  I tried all of the reviewer's suggestions (more honey, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper), and adding more honey was the favorite of my husband.

Fantastic! This dip is good on all kinds of meat. I first used it with a chicken fondue. Then, I tried it with porkloin. And just today, I used it to make a turkey salad sandwich. My only substitution was light miracle whip for the mayo.

I was not a fan of honey mustard sauce until I had it on some coconut chicken tenders at a restaurant in Florida.  I made this exactly as written (for some home made chicken tenders) and it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing, it's exactly what I was looking for.

I was looking for a honey-mustard dipping sauce that was similar to one I get with chicken strips from a national pizza chain... this one is almost perfect!    Unfortunately when I tried the recipe I only had yellow mustard, no Dijon, and a "zippy" salad dressing style mayo instead of plain mayo, so I plan on trying again with the proper ingredients to see if it is closer to the taste of the chain version I'm trying to replace.

I made this for chicken nuggets sort of last minute.  Even though the recipe says to let it chill in fridge overnight, we ate it within an hour of making it, and it was still good.  Probably even better today;  this will be my go-to honey mustard dipping sauce recipe.  It is exactly what I was looking for.

I made this sauce in a pinch yesterday without letting it stand overnight and it was still delicious and I will definately use the recipe again. This time I will let it stand overnight so it will be a little less runny.

My 11 year old went to town on this. I served it as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets. I think the dijon gave it the perfect amount of spice.

Excellent.  I used deli mustard with whole mustard grains in it and a little extra honey.  I needed it in a pinch so I didn't let it chill overnight as the recipe called for.  It was great anyway.  Perfect compliment to the Baked Chicken Nugget recipe!

This was amazing.  I was responsible for chicken strips and honey mustard sauce at a church function. After frying the chicken strips, I realized I had not honey mustard.  I found this recipe and I will never buy honey mustard sauce again. Absolutely an amazing recipe!  Thanks, Jillena!

This is the first time I have ever felt strongly enough to review a recipe.  This honey mustard sauce was AWESOME!!!  To me it tasted exactly like Wendy's Honey Mustard sauce.  I added 3 tablespoons of honey.  Someone asked me for a spoon so they could eat just the sauce.  I would definitely make it again.
