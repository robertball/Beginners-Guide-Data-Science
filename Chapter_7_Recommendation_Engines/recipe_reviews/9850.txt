For a diet freindly version I used Splenda instead of sugar, left out the chocolate and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts....taste great, less guilt! Thank you for sharing!

Easy and fabulous. I used 2 tips I found in a review here: I used a piping bag to put the meringues on the baking sheet, and I put them in the turned-off 350 degree for a half-hour and then baked them at 200 degrees for about 45 minutes. Everyone loved the s'mores taste. Perfect!

I think this recipe is really great because it doesn't require very many ingredients and most of which can be found even in a poorly stocked kitchen. The recipe makes plenty so you can share with friends. I brought them to school and everyone went crazy over them. They've got the tempting looks, the chewiness of chewing gum and the taste of marshmallows and chocholate. Plus it melts in your mouth like cotton candy. It was quick cooking since prep time was low. Such a great taste is worth the overnight wait.

This was really good! They were gone fast! I did not use chocolate chips, and I replaced the vanilla with honey. Everything else was kept the same.

These are easy and tasty!  I made a double batch the first time and it filled 4 cookie sheets and a pizza pan!  I used half vanilla and half almond extract, crushed the chocolate chips and cooked them in the turned off 350 oven for 30 mins, then at 200 for 45 mins - they turned out crunchy all the way thru.  Next time I will cook them as directed because I'd prefer them a little chewy in the middle.

I followed the recipe perfectly but these came out of the oven looking very much like when they went in.  They were white and shiny with a very chewy texture and I didn't care for the taste.  I put them back in the oven at 350F for 15-20 minutes and they came out much better - dry and crisp on the outside with a little bit of a chewy center.  I liked them much better that way.  Also, I used grated chocolate instead of chocolate chips.

I've heard of pie meringues using cream of tartar, but never have used it for just simple meringues. It's unnecessary as long as you have your sugar to egg white ratio correct, add the sugar slowly, and beat the whites to stiff peaks.

These meringue kisses are GREAT!  They do not turn out dry like many other meringue cookie recipes or store-bought meringue cookies.  I use mini chocolate chips.  My family loves coconut, so I add 1/4 cup of shredded coconut with the chocolate chips.  They are kind of fragile to pack in lunch bags/boxes, but they are a delicious treat at home!

I made these meringues the other day for a light alternative to a chocolate chip cookie -- they were great!

I made a few changes to the recipe, though...mostly technical.  One of my changes was astetic:  I scooped the mixture into a large plastic zip top bag and cut the corner out to make prettier swirly meringues.  Another change was simply because I couldn't wait 5 hours for them to set -- I left them in the turned off 350 degree over for only a half hour, then set my oven at 200 degrees and left the meringues in for about 45 minutes....they were delightfully crisp, airy, melty and everything a meringue should be, with much less baking time!

This was my first time making meringue cookies and I wasn't sure if it was going to be a hit or a miss. I didn't have cream of tartar or chocolate chips. I made the recipe without those ingredients, but added a teaspoon of honey when it said to add chocolate chips. Baked like the others who reviewed it did (200 for 30 min instead of leaving them in the oven overnight) and they turned out perfect! Made about 18-20 instead of just 12 and they were pretty good sized. Light and fluffy with a marshmallow like inside. UPDATE: They are just as good later and they store very well. They do stick to your teeth though, only down side.

I made these for Passover. Instead of using white sugar I used baker's sugar. It really gave a professionall looking meringue.  I also didn't use chocolate chips 'cause I didn't have any ones that were kosher for Passover. The kisses came out beautiful. The only problem was that most of them didn't make it to the dessert part of the dinner. Most were eaten before the meal even started!

Easy and good recipe. Although, I got 35 meringues out of this recipe instead of just 12. Maybe I made them smaller, but I did them in "heaping tablespoons" and if I made them so there were only 12, they would have been huge! I've never had meringues that were larger than bite size. Either way, this recipe worked out great. I used dried "just whites" egg whites because I didn't have real eggs. Turned out wonderfully and this was my first time making meringues. I also put them in the oven for 30 minutes after turning off the 375 and then turned the heat to 200 for 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested to make it go faster.

Meringues are supposed to be dry; they're not a moist cookie.  So if you like yours moist, this is a rare meringue recipe for you!

I live in Florida so I was concerned with how these might turn out because of the humidity.  However, they are light and airy and just melt away in your mouth.  Someone else compared them to cotton candy and I have to agree as far as the taste goes.  I subbed splenda for the sugar and am pretty sure they would taste better with sugar.  Next time, maybe I'll use half sugar and the other half splenda.  I did just as the instructions said,   Put them in a preheated 375 degree oven, turned the oven off and left them in there without peeking...for 4 hours...then I couldn't wait any longer and they are perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy and extreemly easy. Without the chocolate chips, it's a great alternative to heavier cookies and much tastier than the store bought kind.

I've been looking for this recipe. YAY!!!! Found it! To the rater who left a false (LOW!) rating with a question: Yes, these work fine in a gas oven. Make sure your oven is preheated to the desired heat, open it just long enough to stick your pans in and close it! Some folks noted that they left the oven on low (200) for a bit to help it along, but my mother made these for decades in a gas oven and literally, preheated it, put them in, turned it off and pulled them out the next morning. Yummy!

I liked this easy recipe.  It was fun to make the little dolops of fluff that turned into light chewy treats. You can have an afternoon snack with just minutes of work in the morning. Leave them in the oven until evening when you get  home and the kids have a great treat. I did not have the chocolate chips this time. I did end up immediately making a second batch (ended up with two round pizza pans full)My hubby thought they tasted like marshmallow peeps! Fun recipe, thanks.

Meringue drops/kisses are really good.  You need some knack in the baking process to get the flaky, non-sticky kisses.  But, even a goof is very edible but not really presentable to company as they will likely be sticky and be chewy (like gum).  Of course, my son like the chewy ones best.  I followed this basic recipe but omitted the chocolate and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda.  I ground the sugar in a food processor to reduce the crystal size.  For some I used a vanilla and almond extract mix and in another batch I used peppermint extract.

I think these were probably good for meringue cookies, but I found out that I am not really a huge fan of meringue cookies. Others that ate them thought they were good meringue cookies.  They had chocolate in them, which is the best part!  Gave me something new to try with leftover egg whites.

I made these last night and have been nibbling on them all day. They are wonderful. I made them with mini chocolate chips and also a little almond extract added in with the vanilla. I like the initially crunchy texture that turns into a chewy surprise. I am always looking for cookies I can eat  and since I am gluten sensitive I usually don't find good ones. This one is a keeper!
