We made this for dinner last night and my son went back for thirds!  Added extra onion [because we like onion], a can of chickpeas and some frozen spinach for veggies & ½ tsp of Garam Masala for a bit of extra spice to the pot.  This turned out fantastic and we will definitely be making this again!

Oh my goodness, does this taste wonderful!  I turned it into a main course, adding grilled chicken, zucchini, yellow squash and fresh peppers.  Fantastic!

I've made about 10 times and it is AMAZING! I use our rice cooker (using the White Rice setting) and just throw everything in the pot - but left out the added salt since the chicken broth has plenty already.  Thanks AF!

This was my first experience with quinoa and I'm very excited about how it turned out! Such a simple and yummy recipe that we really enjoyed! I followed the directions exactly except for using two tsp of regular chili powder since I didn't have ancho. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again, Thank you!

This is a very interesting quinoa recipe. We added lemon juice and it really made it pop! Next time I will reduce the chile powder because it was just a little bit too strong. All in all very enjoyable.

I used this recipe for my first attempt to cook quinoa, after hearing about how good it is for you.  I liked it very much.  I made the following changes though, based on others' reviews.  Sub. chili powder for the ancho chili, add 1T. lemon juice, add 1 t. garam masala, and 1-2 cans drained chickpeas and/or cooked chicken breast.

This was my first attempt with cooking quinoa and it was surprisingly easy! This recipe was absolutely delicious and both myself and my dinner guests raved about it. A few modifcations I made were to add alot of veggies: asparagus, broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini and bok choy which I sauteed in chicken broth, added a few dashes of soy sauce and sriracha (hot sauce) and some chicken breast. I threw in prawns at the end as well. I cooked the quinoa and sauteed onion with curry and chile powder in my rice cooker and added to the veggie mix at the end. This dish was so flavorful, very easy and quick to prepare. It is a new household favorite.

This is so good! I did change it up a bit by adding 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a can of chickpeas.  I also threw in some craisins.  Loved it! Thanks!

Hubby said it was a 5. Since we've been exposed to several Quinoa recipes, we really like it. I will reduce the ancho chile powder to 2 tsp next time because I felt it overpowered the curry.

My husband and I love this! It's been added to the weekly rotation in our household. We were looking for new ways to introduce quinoa on a more regular basis, and this is it. I add diced red &/or green pepper depending on what I have on hand, plus diced chicken breast and a can of chick peas (rinsed). I ran out of chile powder last time I made this, so just increased the cayenne. We both love spicy food, and it was perfect. I also used vegetable broth vs. chicken broth because that was all I had, and it was still perfect. This is one of those recipes you can play with and probably never screw up. That means it's a keeper in my book :)

This was my first time cooking quinoa and I wanted to find something that I knew would be flavorful.  I love curry and so I decided on this.  I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the curry by half and decreased the chile powder by half.  I LOVED how it spelled cooking and it was very very tastey.  My fiance liked it but thought maybe the curry flavor was too strong (but remember I increased it).  Will definitely make this again.

Decent, but nothing incredibly special. I added chickpeas and lightly fried zucchini to the recipe to make it slightly heartier, but found the flavor overall to be somewhat one-dimensional. I let it cool a bit (to slightly warmer than room temperature), and then added cilantro, which made it much tastier.

Very delicious!  Added chicken and made it for lunch...  added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end for a little acidity.  I'll definitely make this again!

A little too much spice (chile powder) for my taste and I didn't even use a whole tablespoon.  Otherwise a very tasty recipe.  Ate with tempeh and veggies.  Yum!

Great flavor!  My family isn't  a huge fan of ancho chile flavor, so I omitted it, but the curry flavor was fantastic.  Will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and we loved it! I had to sub red pepper flakes for the ancho chile powder because that is what I had on hand but other than that I stuck to the exact directions of the recipe. I thought the flavors in this dish really went well together. This was our first time trying quinoa and I would say this a great way to start off if you have never made it before. The instructions were simple and quick. My husband loved it which shocked me because he is not very adventurous when it comes to his taste buds. I will definitely make this again!

Really good! I used only 1/2 Tbsp chili powder (regular was all I had) and 1 tsp of curry powder and it was perfect for us! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, as well. Adding some veggies and leftover chicken sometimes, to make a meal. Very yummy.

Sorry, but after trying other quinoa recipes, we just weren't fans of this one.  First of all, it makes enough for 3-4 people as a side dish, instead of 2 as stated. Our main problem was that it had a slightly burned flavor, and that, combined with the overpowering chile powder drowned out the great curry taste that we expected. I'm not sure why it tasted burned; I think it might have something to do with the fact that it was "toasted" for 5 minutes (which I've never had to do in other quinoa recipes).  I won't be making this again.

This was also my first time cooking quinoa.  I am so happy that i tried this recipe!! I have wanted to try quinoa for a while and this recipe is sooooo good I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!  Other reviews said the chile powder was too much, but i used regular chile powder and a full tablespoon and it was delicious!  I added some red pepper flakes right before i ate it to add some spice and i think that is all it needed! I highly recommend trying quinoa cooked this way!

I did this a bit differently, no broth or chilies, just salt, herbs and water to cook the quinoa after washing it (i always wash it to wash off the excess starches). Sautéed the onion (a medium-large one) separate and added it halfway through cooking the quinoa. Kept some onion back for my shrimp which I sautéed with curry, cumin, turmeric, olive oil, coconut oil and a dash of salt. 8 minutes before the quinoa was cooked I added the onion with frozen shelled edamame and small frozen peas. The result was outstanding and the inspiration came from here so thanks.

I love making this! I also turned it into a main course and made a few modifications: didn't have ancho chile powder so just used regular chili powder. I did 4 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoons. I added a can of drained chickpeas, 1/2 of a red pepper (diced),  1/2 cup of chopped spinach, 1/2 tsp of garam masala, and added about a half pound of sauteed chicken. When I sauteed the chicken I seasoned it with salt, pepper, turmeric, and paprika and just cooked it in olive oil with garlic. Turned out great! Had to add a little salt to off-set the spice, but overall great recipe.

This was very easy to make and it was delicious!  I thought it sounded too simple to taste so great, but wow was I wrong.  Fabulous dish, easy to work with.  I didn't have the right kind of chili, so I just used regular chili powder and it was still awesome.  Thank you for a great fast recipe.  I took it to a potluck and everyone that tried it really liked it.

This is pretty tasty - good amount of flavor from the curry and chili powder.

We LOVED this recipe!!  We just added some cauliflower to it when there was about 10 minutes into the simmering.

I serve this in a baked acorn squash half (baked with butter and brown sugar).  The sweetness of the squash compliments the flavorful quinoa and it looks very nice!

Absolutely delicious! I used some dried ancho chilies I had that I ground up. It was quite spicy, but we love hot food, and it was full of amazing flavour. I served it with the Asian Salmon from this site.

Fantastic flavour and so easy!
Didn't have Ancho chili powder so I used Indian Red Chili powder instead but it has  some heat so I used only 3/4 tsp.
Thanks for sharing

This dish is terrific, but I took it one step further and after it was finished, I added some spaghetti sauce that I had made, and froze.  A little chicken, mushrooms, then I chopped up and steamed some broccoli and added that to the top!  A great meal!

i liked it, but the finishing taste was a bit bitter. my husband thought it was okay. i used about a teaspoon of regular chili powder and it was good! i used lemon juice, but i don't know if i could tell a difference. maybe i'll sweeten it next time?

Very good!  LOVE LOVE LOVE quinoa and this had really nice flavour!  Didn't have any ancho chile powder, so used chipotle chili instead and threw in some garam masala with the curry powder.  Yummy, thanks!

Well, if I have to eat quinoa, I guess this is a good recipe.  I would add more curry flavor and less chili powder flavor, but that's just me. My husband liked it though.

Made exactly as written except I used "chili powder" (didn't have ancho specifically). Flavorful with a little kick; not too spicy or salty. Ate way more than I should have! Will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this!  I made it for myself and modified it just a tad because I was afraid it would be too spicy.  For 1 serving, I used around 3/4 tsp. each of the curry powder and regular chili powder.  Had I done the recommended 1 1/2 tsp. for 1 serving, I think it would have been way to spicy.  But, if that's what you like, go for it!

Delicious! I followed this exactly except I added a few carrots and celery to the  onions.  I added the spices to the onions before I poured the broth the brown them.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a can of chick peas, so I doubled the curry (kept the chili powder the same).  The combinations are endless.  Really great recipe that was the perfect compliment to BBQ'd tofu.

This was my first attempt at quinoa for the family. It was a bit spicey for the kids, but if I scale that down, I think we'll eat it again.

I tried this for the first time tonight. This was my first time cooking quinoa, as well. The texture was perfect, it was just a little too spicy for us. We ate it all regardless, but maybe next time I will not add as much of the chile powder. The texture was perfect though!

So good!  And very easy to make.  I added a small diced potato and peas, and used red pepper flakes in place of ancho chili powder.  Fantastic, and simple to freeze leftovers for later...

The recipe as it is written would be a great side dish, but to make it more of a meal I added the following at the end (without cooking): 1) 1/3 C sliced almonds 2) 1/2 cub sliced celery 3) 1 diced mango 4) Hubby added chicken. I also added less ancho powder as others had suggested (about 2 tsp) and omitted the salt and pepper.  Was delicious!!

I didn't really care for this, and neither did my husband.  I did have to sub dark chili powder for the ancho, so that might have made the difference.  This just tasted incredibly over-seasoned, and almost bitter.  I did find that after rinsing and draining it, the quinoa only took a few minutes to toast.  I think 5 at medium heat on my stove would have burnt it.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Have made this recipe several times and it is always amazing! I have a 13 year old VERY picky eater and he loves this! Eats it by the plate full and goes back for seconds andThirds! Although I did tell him it was a special kind of rice because he won't touch Quinoa! I guess what he doesn't know won't kill him! ??

WOW!  This was a hit all around!  Even my picky 8 year old wanted more!  The only changes I made were: vegetarian broth, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 teaspoon of chili powder and I added some peas.  Will definitely make again.

awesome recipe: I combined some of the suggestions above including chick peas, Marsala, soy sauce, shrimp and chicken. I added: fresh coriander, celery, green red yellow and orange peppers. I was liberal with the spice and therefore added brown sugar, which any chef will   tell you is essential with hot spices.
bon appetite!

5 stars. My wife and I loved this, but the kids said "Not spicy enough."  I substituted chili powder for the ancho, and next time I'll add more curry. I'm heating up the leftovers with more spice and some lime juice now.

Very tasty!! I cubed and sauteed some chicken breast...added to the quinoa mix about 5 min shy of the 25 min simmer. I also added some water (about 1/2 c.) in addition to a can of reduced sodium chicken stock. I will definitely add tomatoes and veggies, maybe chickpeas (as seen in previous review) next time, just to bulk it up a bit and make it more like a main dish. The flavor was really great and just the right amount of spicy!! Yum!!!

I enjoyed this dish. First time for me making quinoa and I had a taste too for something curry. I added a good couple shakes of cayenne pepper because I only had standard chili powder and added peas because another reviewer did and it looked like a nice addition and it was. My dish cooked up quicker than the stated time and because of that I had more liquid than needed. I took the cover off and continued to cook until the liquid was gone. Most important to follow your quinoa's package instructions. Some have to be rinsed before using in a recipe and others do not. Still this recipe was tastey and leftovers are just as good cold.

This deserves six stars!!!  Even my normally picky husband went back for seconds and raved about how delicious it was.  I made my quinoa in the rice cooker with the spices, browned the onion and garlic in a frying pan and added peas for some extra veggies.  It was amazing.  Amazing.  This will become a regular in the rotation.

Easy and delicious. Thanks for the great recipe! I used water instead of broth and left out salt and pepper. Has excellent flavor. Added a bit of avocado.

OMG i just finished making this and it is fantastic!! i read other reviews and i also added lemon juice, onion, garam masala and replaced the ancho chile powder for chili powder (as i didn't have the other). i will definitely make this again, but next time i think i'll add some carrots and celery, mushrooms would be good too i think. thanks for this great dish!

I very rarely rate/review receipes but just had to review this one.  I found this receipe a while back but never made it as it seemed too simple or basic.  Wrong!  The flavor of this dish is amazing and it will be a great base for seafood, chicken, beans or veggies.  I just made it to take for lunch this week with some chopped up rotisserie chicken, but can't stop eating it.  I think I'm going to have to make another batch for lunch.  I did take reviewers' suggestions and decreased chili (because its not my favorite flavor) and added garam masala (one of my favorite spices)...however, I am sure the receipe as written is perfect as well.

This was excellent.  I mistakenly used regular chili powder and it was still excellent.  I  used homemade chicken soup.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you.

Really good and easy to make.  I add lots of vegetables (zucchini, peppers, eggplant, tomatoes).  My picky children even enjoy it.  I sometimes double it for leftovers the next day.

Everyone in the family said the same thing, "tasteless".  It had a kick from the chili powder but that was it.  Back to the drawing board.  Still searching for a great quinoa recipe.

Great recipe. We have been trying to find ways to jazz up quinoa for a while now and this seems to hit the spot. We've made it a few times - We only use half the chilli powder, as recommended by other reviews. The first time we added chick peas, fresh spinach and mushrooms. It was a delicious vegetarian meal. The second time we were running low on groceries, so we used frozen green beans and left over chorizo sausage. Also a big hit with the family. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, what a fabulous dish!  Everyone in the family loved it, even the picky kid.  I did make a couple of changes to it:  I added sauteed thinly sliced carrots and red & green peppers to the quinoa in the last 5 minutes of cooking, I cut the spices in half (for the picky kid), and I added some leftover diced porkchop while it was simmering.  What a wonderful, healthy meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I think the recipe is a good start. I thought the ancho was a bit harsh in this so I'll cut back a little next time. Also, I think the recipe needs some "stuff" in it.. chopped veggies or something. I'll add some to the leftovers.

This is super easy to make.  I always double it and it's just as good.  It can be a bit spicy so using regular chile powder and even half the amount is ok for those with tender taste buds... it still tastes good. :)

Love love it. It was so good. I like it better cold. Throw some chicken in there and you have a good dish. I also took others advance and put 2 tsp chili powder in instead of ancho chili pwd. ( because I didnt have any)

This was my FIRST time trying quinoa and I loved it. This is a great base recipe and next time Id like to add peas like in the pic. I LOVE spicy food and after I ate this I had a cup of yogurt to soothe the hot. Thanks for a great starter recipe for trying quinoa! CHEERS!

Happy to find a new quinoa recipe! This was a super simple recipe to make and I threw in a can of chickpeas and some frozen green peas for extra oomph. It was delicious paired with Christine L.'s Baked Sweet Potato Sticks from this site. The recipe made a huge batch and my husband and I will enjoy eating the leftovers for lunch this week. Fast to prepare and very rewarding to eat!

Fast, easy, and delicious! I subbed a bit of extra curry powder for the chile, which worked nicely--there's still a good kick. I also doubled the recipe so that I could have leftovers, and they reheat perfectly. Will definitely make again soon!

Great recipe! I made it in my ricecooker and it worked well. I also added garbanzos and my 4 year old son recommended we try adding broccoli next time. It has the kind of taste and texture that definitely lends itself to adding vegetables in!

This was my first try at quinoa, and it was easy and delicious.  It makes more than 4 servings, for sure.  Substituted beef broth that I needed to use up, and I thought it tasted great.  I agree with other reviewers, the possibilities for improvising are endless.

A great easy recipe that can be simply modified to your taste preferences!  Like others, I added chicken and some vegetables (so many options on veggies that you could add that each time you make it, it will be a whole new dish).  We went with frozen peas and fresh carrots per my 2 year old daughter's suggestion.  I also did only 1 tsp of Chili powder (what I had on hand and lowered for more sensitive 2yo taste buds).  I only had vegetable stock on hand, but it was still delicious.  Next time I want to use coconut milk to give it a Thai flavor!  Yum!  Oh, and my daughter loved it!

A great way to do something different with quinoa. I added frozen peas, chopped zucchini, and fresh ground black pepper. I added it all towards the beginning, but if I do it again I will add the zucchini towards the end so it doesn't get mushy. Also added some shrimp at the end, and topped with Sriracha, which I highly recommend if you are a hot sauce lover. It goes well with this flavor combination.

My family hasn't fully embraced the "Indian" flavors, but this hit the spot.  My 5 year old wolfed it down, pausing only to sip her milk.  I added a can of chick peas, and we had some leftover peas that made their way into the mix.  It wasn't until after we had supper that I forgot that I didn't add salt and pepper.  The left overs were fantastic I've eaten them warm and cold for lunch.  Low fat, high protein, high fiber, all in all a fantastic dish.  It's on the make again list!

With the addition of an extra onion, zucchini, peppers and other veggies this was a 5 star. I have made it several times, also added garma masala as one reviewer suggested. Great quick, easy and healthy dish :)

We liked it a lot but my 3 year old did not, but that's ok.  I only ask that he at least tries everything on his plate.  I used the full amount of curry powder, only added half the amount of chili powder, but I added a bit of garam marsala too.  I also added a bit of frozen corn at the end and the juice from a lime.  I would eat this again, and play around the spices to make it a bit milder.

This was insanely good. My 'weird' grain cautious husband loved it. I made 2 changes (I try not to do that but I didn't have ancho chile anything in the house). I left out the ancho and I was running low on curry powder so I used about 2 tsp of curry (all I had left) and I added about 2 tsp of garam masala. We ate more of this quinoa than we did the entree or veggies. I am sure it is really good with the just the curry but adding the garam masala added a depth and complexity that just tasted amazing. We are looking forward to adding this to our dinner rotation.

Really, I give this recipe a 4.5. I followed the recipe as is, except using regular chili powder b/c I did not have ancho chile powder. Regardless, it was very good and I will definitely try this recipe again, adding some veggies and chicken next. Definitely a keeper in my book!

Loved it but being a vegetarian I opted for vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I also added fresh kale (at the garlic/onion stage) and fried tofu in the simmering stage.  At the very end I mixed in some coconut cream to balance everything out.  I will def have this again and I cannot wait to play around with different veggies.

Great dish.  Might never eat rice again.  Tough to picture this being any better, but I think I'll try Kofa's lemon juice idea next time.  I had no chile powder so just used paprika instead.  Based on other reviews, this may be a good substitute anyway.

Absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 tbsp garam masala, used regular chili powder as per others reviews. Next time I will add some peas to bulk it up, as in the photo, but I didn't have them on hand this time.

This was delicious!  My 1st quina recipe & my husband& i are hooked!  Read up on the health benefits of quinoa & who can refuse!  Sub'd red chili powder as other mentioned.  Also, found a recipe for homemade garam masala...made it & added 1/2 tsp...too many spices!  Not hot spicy, but just over spiced that you get tired of the flavor.  My husband still like it, which was great since we don't eat Indian food, but I would try b/4 adding additional spices!!!  Will def make again!

I followed the recipe. I used Chili 3000 and Vindaloo from Penzeys spices. The chili spice overwhelmed the whole recipe. Nex time I will just use the Vindaloo curry. Not the most alluring blend of flavors. Wi the leftovers I will add some chicken and see how that fares.

Excellent dish!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 tsp. of regular chili powder.  It gave it just enough spiciness.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added a can of rinsed garbanzo beans to up the protein even more.  I will make this one again!

A pretty basic recipe, as you can see from the other reviews, there is alot you can do with it.  I made it as-is except for I used turkey stock instead of chicken broth because that is what I had on hand but it would be good with chicken broth too.  Not my favorite because I like something with a little more pizzaz, but this was the first quinoa recipe I've tried that my kids would actually eat so that's great.

This was very good! I love Quinoa it is so healthy and the texture is so unique. It is hard to describe it's nutty yet really mild in flavor and sort of pops in your mouth as you chew it. I also think it is so beautiful when cooked has little spirals on each grain. LOVE IT! This is a very good quinoa recipe (providing you are a fan of curry!).

I add mixed veggies and chicken with less chilli powder. I double the recipe. I baked the chicken separately, then slice in small chunks and add it to the finished quinoa. Delicious. Add butter and seasoning salt for more flavour. Mmmm.

Easy to make. Flavorful. I made shrimp to toss in in, but would be good adding veggies and/or chicken too to make a complete meal.

Yes,  I used 2 tlb of olive oil, and added about 1/2 cup of bell pepper, plus the small onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  I did not use the chili powder and I only used 1 chicken bouillon with the 2 cups of water.  It was very delicious.  when eating, I did add a little salt and a tad bit of cayenne pepper.  Very good.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a tasty and easy way to serve quinoa.  The flavors can be boosted or exchanged to suit your taste.  It would also do well as a main dish by adding a diced protein and some chopped veggies.

Made this for my 9 month old daughter and boyfriend and they both loved. We are trying to find rice alternatives so this was amazing. I made it with slow cooked jerk chicken thighs.

This is a delicious dish, as is, yet versatile with whatever veggies you want to add! Also, you can add a meat, cheese or fresh herbs if you’d like. Leftovers good cold or warmed up! This is a keeper!

! tbl of curry powder and chile powder made this inedible!! I'd try it again but would cut back to maybe 1 Tsp of curry and chile powder to see what it would taste like.  Even the photo shown makes the quinoa look a lot lighter in colour. Mine was very dark in colour.

I improvised quite a bit, adding some Roma tomatoes sautéed at the beginning, a can of garbanzo beans, and my favorite part...  nutritional yeast at the end.  Without it, it felt like it was missing something.  Was skeptical of the chile powder but I really enjoyed it!

I made this today, instead of using the regular broth I used two cubes of boullion and used 2 cups of water. A little extra it dries up fast. I also added chick peas and some salt and pepper while cooking yum! Just as others suggested to add lemon. I did. And it made it wonderful.

Delicious, but always toast curry powder with the onions until fragrant before adding liquid. Ups the dish a notch. Good idea with most spices.

Excellent side dish. Very flavorful and moist. Could easily see this being a main dish just by adding a protein. This would be good with fish, pork, chicken or beef.

Wow! Excellent dish!    ....okay so it's true I did alter it a little, but I believe even the basic fish itself would be delicious too. Anyway, this is what I changed: I added a handful each of frozen peas, broccoli at the time when you add the curry and chili seasonings, and a cut up cooked chicken breast just before serving. Because I used my largest pan I didn't use a cover, I just added a little additional water (3/4 cup approx) when it looked like the quinoa was drying out too fast, and stirred it a few times to help turn the grain.

This is an excellent recipe. It was extremely easy to make. I added pepper, homemade pesto from my garden and a dash of lemon juice. Then I topped my dish with grilled salmon slices, cilantro and diced tomatos and sesame seeds. Definitely will make it again.

I followed jlotterer's advice and cooked everything together in the rice cooker. It was my first time to put other stuff in the rice cooker besides just rice or quinoa alone, so I was nervous, but it turned out great. I added some green onions, and I halved the amount of chili after reading the reviews. Half the chili was definitely spicy enough for us. Next time I will try adding broccoli, zucchini, and meat to make it a main dish.

I really love this dish. However, I cut the amount of chili powder in about half. It was very heavy on chili taste and not so much the curry. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil which gave it a tremendous added hint of flavor!

I didn't think I would, but I have really jumped on the Quinoa Bandwagon. It's so each to cook with and seeing this recipe, I got excited. I Love curry. The combination of these two ingredients together are amazing. I steamed some carrots and added some pineapple to it as well. Paired it with some Breaded Vegan Fish Filets and had an amazing dinner. With the leftovers, I'm going to combine it with another recipe I made from "All Recipes",(Quinoa/Blavk Bean Burgers). Now combing the two recipes I'll have Curry Quinoa Black Bean Burgers, OMG I'm drooling.

First time making Quinoa and this recipe was spot on. I made it for two so made half of the ingredients. After it was done simmering I added some grape tomatoes, cut in quarters, salted and peppered and tossed a bit...was a go in our camp!

This is a great basic recipe, I have made it several times.   For a main dish, you can add a can of chick peas.  Or add extra veggies to customize it for the tastes of your family.  Tonight I added a can of chickpeas, a can of diced tomatoes (undrained), about 1/2 c green peas, 2 carrots cut into 2" pieces and that was dinner.  Other possibilities would be cauliflower or  spinach which would go well with curry seasoning. Didn't have ancho chile powder so subbed with regular chili powder and add tsp of grated ginger.

This turned out really well! I followed the directions precisely, but also added cumin and coriander for extra depth of flavour. And to make it go further I added chickpeas and finished it off with a spritz of lemon juice to balance the flavors. I will make this on a regular basis, I highly recommend this recipe!

Really delicious and easy to make.  I add about half a tablespoon more of curry powder, and it comes out very flavorful.  I used unsalted chicken broth, and with the added curry powder, I honestly didn't feel the need to add more than a pinch or two of salt.  I also like to toss 1/2 to 1 cup of frozen veggie mix during the last 5 or so minutes of cooking.  Frozen veggies make my life easier, but I am sure you could just as easily toss in any fresh veggies you'd like.  You can make it a one pan meal if you tossed in some diced chicken and browned it before simmering.

My family was skeptical.    Not fans of quinoa,  but they said this was really good.  Followed the recipe  as written but reduced ancho chilli seasoning.   I didn't want it too spicy.

I just made this as a healthy option and it's great! I added some mushrooms (chopped in a food processor with the onion and garlic), used 2 tbsps curry (because I LOVE it), vegetable stock instead of chicken, and some spinach. I tried it on a bed of kale and spinach as vegetarian/vegan dish. His is good, but might also work with tofu, or chicken/fish if you're not vegetarian/vegan.

LOVED this recipe.  Made it as a side for Christmas instead of the traditional mashed potatoes & gravy.  I loved the spicy curry flavor with the turkey dinner.
I am definitely making this again!  This will pair well with most meats.

I made this! But used veggie broth. I also didn't have curry so I used a curry substitute that o found on google that was a mixture a bunch of things. It called for cinnamon but I omitted that. I also forgot to put in the other spices that that the quinoa recipe called for but it tasted great anyway!!

This is delicious, although it turned out too salty for my taste. Next time I'll skip the added salt and maybe use half broth, half water.

One of the many things I love about the recipes and constructive comments  I find here is the inspiration I get to play: to experiment, expand and see what's possible.

Instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable. I cooked the quinoa in it and added chopped onions, garlic later, ginger and the EVOO I sautéed them in later. I threw in 2 cans of chickpeas (reserve some of the liquid from one of the cans!!), a chopped yellow bell pepper and a big chopped carrot. 

In addition to the ancho chili and curry powders, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of allspice, about teaspoon of smoked paprika and a few shakes of cayenne pepper. 

Toward the end, I realized it needed more liquid so I added a cup of vegetable broth and some of the liquid from the chickpeas. That gave me the consistency I was looking for.

I let this simmer on low for about 25 minutes. I added a wee bit of salt to my serving. It was amazing!!

Excellent!!  Full of flavor and so healthy!  I also added a drained can of garbanzo beans and some chopped roasted red pepper and chopped mango.  Added 1/2 way through the simmer process.  Used chili powder, what I had.  1 tsp of gram marsala. 1 Tbs of lemon juice at the end.  This will be made often in our home!

Added 1/2 tsp of garam masala as recommended, and added a bag of SteamFresh corn + lime. Super tasty- my partner does not typically like curried dishes, and he enjoyed it! Easy and good.

Very good. Loved the smell of the curry spice as the quinoa was cooking!  I used no-chicken chicken broth (bought from Whole Foods), 1 T. of curry and 2 tsp. of ancho chili powder. Also added a cup of frozen peas and a cup of chickpeas at the end of cooking (which the quinoa only took 15 minutes, not 25). Finished with a bit of salt.  Perfect dinner with a side salad!
I will make this again.

Just made this for lunch today. So flavourful! I didn't have any ancho chile powder but I added a pinch of paprika and it worked out perfect. I also added about a cup of chopped kale to the sautéed onion and garlic to give it some colour and add some dimension. It was delicious. I would definitely make this again!

I wanted to find something else to do with quinoa besides putting it in a salad.  THIS WAS FANTASTIC!  I didn't have ancho chili powder.  I just put in a little cayenne pepper.   I look forward to making it again.  ( Next time, I'll probably add some cooked veggies to the quinoa)  It is a keeper!

I liked the concept, but have an indian taste so it was a little bland for me.  I used vegetable broth and added some vegetables, garam masala, lots of salt, cilantro (at the end) and garlic salt.  After these changes I found it a lot better and would definitely make it again! Easy one step dish!

It tasted bitter to me. I used white quinoa and regular chile powder. I couldn't find ancho chile powder. I don't even know if there's a difference.

This was just OK in my book. Sure, probably pretty healthy, and filling, but it just didn't particularly impress me. I made it exactly as written. And I like all the ingredients, too. Worth making again, maybe, as a nutritious side dish, but it's just nothing exciting.

I made this for my breastfed 1y/o, whom I've been creatively making dishes with lots of flavors due to him being very  picky, needless to say the whole family loves it. However I didn't add the chiles, but it was still awesome!

As is, the recipe is fine.  Nothing special - just quinoa with a curry flavor.  Might be better adding peas or chickpeas or something else.

This was a great variation for quinoa. We like curry so this was an easy adaptation and my family liked it. Since I didn't have ancho chili, I just used about 1/2 tablespoon chili powder and it turned out just fine. Want more quinoa options, give this one a try!

This recipe makes at least 6 servings, not 2.  The chile powder overwhelmed this dish.  I hesitated to use it, but went against my better judgement and halved it......it was still too much.  I doubled the curry because I love it, but the chile masked the flavor of the curry entirely. I won't be making this again.

Very good - I added a left over chicken breast (diced) and a 1/2 bag of frozen california blend which I warmed up in the microwave first.

This recipe is great and so versatile. I added raisins (soaked a bit to plump them) and sliced almonds at the end of the cooking time.

Great recipe! I had cooked quinoa with peas left over from the night before..simply prepared rest of recipe as written and then added cooked quinoa at the end. Also used regular chili powder, and bumped up with more Indian spices at the beginning coz I LOVE good spicy Indian food.

Simple and tasty.  I added shrimp to make a main course dish.  Also the addition of fresh lime juice when serving brought out more flavors.  Will make again.

Fantastic! I doubled the curry. With about 5 minutes left on the simmering time I threw in some peas, red pepper & leftover grilled chicken with a few extra splashes of broth. Even my two year old likes it!

Delicious and easy!  I'm trying a diet full of foods that fight inflammation, and the chili pepper, onion, and garlic in this dish fit the bill.
