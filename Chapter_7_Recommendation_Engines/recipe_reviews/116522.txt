The dill is a bit of an acquired taste.  My husband and I loved them.  Kids...not so much.

These were not a hit with my family. It's definitely a matter of taste--they're not bland--but the combination of lemon and dill and turkey was a little odd and just didn't work for us.

We loved these - frying them in just a bit of olive oil in the frying pan worked just fine, too (too lazy to fire up the grill) and we skipped the buns and mayonnaise for a generous topping of tzatziki, as suggested in another review. Definitely a very different flavor for a turkey burger, but it worked well for us.

These were the moistest turkey burgers we've ever had - lots of flavor with the different spices.  Very very good!

LOVE this.  I found the dill that is 'fresh' in a tube in our produce department and that saves on time. I also cook them in the oven under the broiler and they do not dry out. AMAZING.  I cannot get enough of these burgers!

Loved this recipe.  Was looking for a Mediterranean flavored turkey burger, and came across this one.  I omitted the dill, and topped the burgers with homemade Tzatziki sauce (no mayo).   Ate ours open-faced, but would be good on Pitas.

These were ok. My fiance liked them but I don't think I'll make them again. It's a decent base recipe for burgers, but it needs alot more flavor. I didn't expect them to be bland. Sorry.

Refreshingly different flavor. They taste wonderful with avocado and onion on top, instead of lettuce

Yummy tasting.. I love dill so this was good for me. I liked the lemon in it.. brightened it up. Next time I'd add some minced onion in it as it seems to help turkey from drying out
