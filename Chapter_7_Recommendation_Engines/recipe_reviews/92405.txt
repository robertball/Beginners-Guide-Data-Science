Soooo good! The flavor is great, the caramel and chocolate are well balanced. Two tipsâ€¦. You must stir constantly or it will boil over and I had to return it to the heat to completely melt the chocolate, otherwise it was perfect!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. This'll make a wonderful addition to this year's christmas baskets. NOTE: Yes, this was much appreciated by family members who recieved Christmas baskets from me this year. I got a phone call from just about everyone who got a bottle of this and everyone just raved about it. Thanks, Rhonda!

Tastes great, but I too had it turn out so thick that it wouldn't pour.  It would be fun to put it into candy molds and then drop a few into a mug before pouring coffee/espresso on top.  However, it says *syrup* and it's really not a syrup as written.  

Table sugar won't begin to brown until over 300*F, but the mixture can't rise above 212*F until after the water is boiled off.  Thus, the resultant slurry will be very thick at room temperature.  It might help to brown the sugar first and then add the cream, only cooking a bit longer after adding it.

Very rich, almost too sweet!  This would be great on ice cream as well as a beverage flavor!

MMMmm... really good. Make sure you use milk chocolate though. We used semisweet chocolate chips and it's really good, but tastes a bit too much like chocolate chips.

The thickness of this worried me at first because it gets really hard in the refrigerator.  After heating it was perfect--still thick but the espresso melts it.  Stir well.  Perfect level of sweetness.  Definitely a keeper!

Ok, so I must have done something wrong...I ended up with fudge--it tastes great but I must have cooked it too long, even though I set the timer for 10 minutes. Help, what happened?  I was a little short on corn syrup but not by much. What I ended up with would be great in small candy molds because this is so creamy and sweet!

I was not impressed by this mixture.  It was OK, but I wouldn't make it again.

Then tste was good but because the syrup is really thick it makes if difficult to incorporate into the drink. I would not recommend refrigerating this and instead scale the recipe down to make a fresh small amount as needed. I have an espresso machine and I usually do not mix the syrup into the milk I'm steaming. I followed the directions and added it into my steaming pitcher. Although the milk was hot and frothy the syrup was too thick to melt and mix in so I had to use a spoon. Overall the taste was great, it's just the consistency of the syrup that requires some extra work. I subbed raw agave for corn syrup.
