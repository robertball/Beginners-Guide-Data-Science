I developed a recipe very similar to this after our family fell in love with a mussel dish from Carrabba's restaurant. 
  To dry a variation on the above recipe, substitute dry white wine for the sherry;
add about 4 tablespoons of Pernot, substitute fresh basil for the Italian seasoning *double the basil for using fresh*; use fresh or canned chicken broth instead of boullion cubes *too salty IMO*; and add about 2 cups heavy cream. 
  Oh my GOSH will you be in hog heaven over these mussels. The given recipe works up very well, but try the changes if you want to try a creamy version with a slightly different sauce.

I felt the sherry was overpowering the dish, so I added low salt chicken broth to try and balance out the flavors. That addition seemed to make all the difference. Good start tho as I do enjoy the taste of sherry. Thank you!

these were good substituting the sherry for 1/2 dry white wine, 1/2 low sodium chicken broth. I use way more garlic, but that is a personal preference. I also use basil... so i really didn't follow the original recipe all that much but it is a good start. What we do is when eating is have a cup of melted butter and a cup of old bay seasoning. First, dip in butter, then dip in old bay... then sit back and feel the love... :). can you tell we love our mussels!

I thought these were fabulous!  My husband gobbled them up, too!  However, I only put 4 stars because I thought it called for way too much sherry, mine tasted just great with half the amt. of what the recipe called for.  THanks!!

Went over well with the people I made it for.  I'm not a sherry drinker, so I cut the sherry with low sodium broth as per a previous comment and that was great.  Next round I'll probably add some more garlic, just because you can never have too much.

These mussels were awesome. My parents always make mussels but I wanted to cook them with a new recipe and this one was perfect. I actually forgot to put in the onion but they were wonderful anyway. I may be making them again for Sunday dinner.

This was an excellent, very tasty dish. It was my first go at making mussels at home and this was the exact taste we were looking for. My husband loved the sauce. Great tip on having the crusty bread...it is great to sop up the extra sauce.

Highly recommend, but bring an appetite!

Nice tasty treat, I can taste the Sherry which wasn't overwhelming, very nice. I am going to use this recipe again and add a wee dash of Soy Sauce!

This recipe is awesome! I used vegetable broth instead (that's all I had) and I did add about a half cup of heavy cream at the end. We sopped up every last bit with a loaf of Italian bread! I'm going to try using this as a base for a chowder soon, too. Excellent recipe!

I didn't change it much, but I sauteed a medium shallot  and minced 2 of the garlic cloves  and 1 crushed clove in the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. Also, added a couple of fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme (I used lemon thyme) and oregano to the pot toward the end of the cook time.  After reading a few of the comments, I added about a cup of dry white wine to tone down the sherry edge. Took to a party and this amount served 14 as an appetizer course.  Served with fresh wood fired pizza oven crusty bread. OMG!

OMG! SOOOOO Good! I did make one slight variance because I didn't have chicken bouillon or crusty bread. I used shrimp flavored ramen seasoning packet and put it over ramen noodles. Next time I will keep the shrimp seasoning packet and use crusty bread.
