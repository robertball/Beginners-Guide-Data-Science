Love this recipe.  It is so versatile.  I am a vegetarian and make it with spinach and mushrooms.  Sometimes I use Artichoke hearts or sundried tomoto.  But I make this a lot for the rest of my family, who eats meat and I change the ingredients to thier taste.  My dad loves it with pepperoni, sausage and olives.  I just layer this more then the recipe says to, almost like a lasagna but it is awesome overall.

Instead of ground beef used Morningstar sausage crumbles because the girlfriend is a vegetarian.  We 'browned' the crumbles with chopped red onion and green pepper before combinining with the sauce.  Added diced mushroom while layering and turned out very tastey.  The crust left something to be desired but still a fun new twist.  Next time I may try to simmer the sauce longer to thicken it so it is less soupy.  All in all a winnner!

I didn't like the combination of broccoli and the other ingredients.  It would have been better with peppers, mushrooms, etc. I don't think I will make this again.

This was really good! I used spinach, and a 4 Italian cheese blend, instead of the broccoli and mozzarella. Will definitely make this again. Yummy!

THis is very good! okay,so I made a 'few' changes,used regular Ragu sauce,no broccoli or spinach,(it may be good that way and I may try it someday but not now!) so I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage,crumbled that up and added pepperoni and used Colby/monteray Jack cheese and added banana peppers,it turned out so good!  there's just a handful left.

Great recipe, I made individual ones in small Corningware dishes - that way we could all have them our own way!!! They reheat so easy in the microwave or oven!!

I used the Pillsbury pizza dough. It was a little too much dough though.  So, on the second pizza I cut it into strips with scissors and made breadsticks out of the rest.

I tried to make it like an authentic pizza: pepperoni, etc instead of broccoli.  It didn't work. I didn't like how the mozzarella melted to the crusted and I didn't like how the crust tasted.  I guess I'm a traditional pizza kind of person and this definitely didn't do it for me.

I thought this was pretty great. I used extra broccoli because I love it in calzones and pizza. The canned crust was good but next time I'm going to look into a homemade dough recipe.

I made this dish two separate times; the first I followed the recipe very closely except for the brand of pizza dough on top. It turned out too bland for our tastes and I had too much dough leftover. The second time, I was way more liberal with spices and veggies and I cut away a lot of the excess dough. The turn out was better but still not "wow" for us. Who knows, maybe the third times a charm.

Made this the the other night for supper. Turned out great, even the leftovers were good.  I did use Italian sausage instead of ground beef, also added turkey pepperoni, black olives, and hot peppers.  Will definately make this again!!!

My husband and I liked it, but we didn't LOVE it. Instead of using ground meat, I used Morningstar Crumbles. I added 1/2 tsp. oregano to the crumbles. I used spinach which I jazzed up with 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of oregano. Then I added a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives. I cut back on the cheese, only using 3/4 c. and topped it with the pizza dough. It didn't really taste like pizza to me, but it was good. I will probably make it again. Next time I may mix the spinach with ricotta cheese. If someone else tries it in the meantime, I'd love to hear about it.

Easy to make and my family liked it. The beef needs seasoning, salt and pepper, of course, and I added garllic powder and oregano as well. Don't forget to drain the fat from the beef after it is browned. 2/3 of a jar of pasta sauce was plenty to make the bottom layer saucy, but not runny. Thanks!

This was so good and easy! I added chopped onion and bellpepper while I was browning my meat. I also added mushrooms and still used the brocoli. My husband loved it! I even added a little shredded parmesean cheese to the pizza dough. It was amazing! The leftovers were just as Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Neither my husband or my three year old liked this. I didn't try it because I don't eat flour/sugar. I think I'll just stick to my regular homemade pizza for my family.

Very tasty.  I used Italian turkey sausage, spinach and black olive and made my own crust and my family absolutely loved this.  This recipe is a keeper.

My family really likes this, I tweak it a bit by adding about 1 tsp garlic powder a shake or 2 of italian seasoning to the sauce mixture, I used a garden combination flavor.  I also shake in about 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese with the mozzerella. Oh and I use 2 packages of broccolii so they get some extra 'good for you' veggies:)   I use a regular pizza dough from my grocery store deli and use the extra dough to make bread sticks

This is a great concept, but Ragu (or any canned or bottled sauce) is just too sweet for us. It's a kid pleaser.

Great, versatile recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and opted to use the spinach.  I had a couple questions as I went along, which I will answer for others here.  First, I couldn't find a 10 oz. can of refrigerated pizza crust, only a 13 oz. can (or 13.25?) and an 11 oz.  I went with the 13 oz can and it worked very well.  I had a little dough remaining on the edges, which was more from me kneading it out larger than necessary.  I trimmed the excess off but could just as easily worked it into the edge, it is after all intended to be a pizza crust (thick and bubbly) and not a pie crust.  I was also unsure if my deep dish pie plate was considered a 2 qt dish.  I just went with it and it worked out perfectly.  I also thought after adding the tomato sauce that the meat mixture would be too runny.  While it certainly is more "liquidy" than the sauce and meat you'd find on a normal pizza, it worked out well and I think I will just continue to use the 26 oz of sauce as called for.  And just a note, it's cool and all to think of this as an "upside down" pizza, but you must eat this with a fork, so it feels more like a pizza casserole of a sort.  Either way, it's delicious.  Enjoy!

Definitely better with spinach than with broccoli.  I add onions while browning the ground beef.  Very versatile--my friend even adds pesto to this at times.  Can be made ahead of time and baked later, or brought to a friend who just had a new baby, etc.  Great recipe!

The first time I made this, my fiance's parents LOVED it, and everyone else hated it! The combination of broccoli and beef and pizza ingredients was not a hit with most of the family!! The next time I made it, I used "pizza" ingredients, like veggies for the vegetarian version (mushrooms, olives, banana peppers, green peppers) and pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and banana peppers for the meat-lovers version. It was a big hit then! I don't think some of my family members even recognized it as the same recipe at first!!

Very bland IMHO. Even "doctored" it up a bit by adding onion, roasted red peppers and black olives which we love on regular pizza.

This recipe was easy enough, but I used spinach in mine.  The spinach tasted like dirt, but maybe it was just the brand I bought.  I did use crescent rolls instead of pizza dough because that's what I had on hand.  Everything but the spinach was yummy, but it doesn't taste like pizza.  I think I would substitute pizza sauce for the spaghetti sauce next time, and maybe try it with the broccoli.

My husband loved this.  I used spinach and sausage as someone suggested and it turned out okay for my taste.  I thought it could have used a little more flavor.

My husband and I thought this was very good.  We used ground turkey, hot turkey sausage and tukey pepporoni and also put some jalepeno's peppers in it.  We will make this again and add some veggies!

Better than I thought it would be!  I added a can of tomatoes to the meat along with the sauce.  I also used cauliflower instead of broccoli.  Want to try spinach next!  Topped with a can of crescent rolls and turned out wonderful!  7 out of 7 of us liked it!  MIRACLE

We made this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it.  We used ground turkey instead of beef, cut back on the broccoli a bit, and added a thin layer of pepperoni before the cheese.  Next time we might add another veggie - mushrooms, spinach, etc. because we thought there was too much meat.
