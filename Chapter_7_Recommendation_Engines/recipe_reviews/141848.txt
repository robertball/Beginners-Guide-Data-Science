My husband is chinese so we have the Shiao hsing on hand at all times. I add minced garlic at the same time as the whole cloves. I also add chopped zucchini the last 5 minutes or so to have a vegetable in it.

This recipe was very good but I feel like it was missing something. I added a few small minced shallots minced some of the garlic and increased the amounts of the soy sauce and sherry a bit. Overall very good and I will certainly be making again.

A!! This was so yummy and full of flavor. My whole family loved it. I did use white pepper in place of the black pepper. it gave it more of a asian flavor.

It cooked to a beautiful golden brown and the aroma was mouthwatering and if you added corn starch it made a wonderful gravy; however it seemed to lack something in the flavors. I did have to use a dry sherry so I'm will to hedge that might have been it. Ended up having to add tons of salt but that only went so far. It is worth a shot especially if you prefer subtle flavors over bold ones.

I absolutely love (and order) Garlic Chicken every time I visit a Chinese food restaurant and was very much hoping I'd be able to cook something similar at home - THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME AND TASTED GREAT! 

What was best is that its a very simple recipe to follow and you can add any veggies you want. I didn't have the Shao-Hsing or dry sherry and for only a few TBSP didn't want to buy it so I used a little soy sauce in it's place. It was delicious! Didn't change another thing with the base recipe but added my own veggies during the simmering phase.
Thanks for a great recipe I know I'll use over and over.

This turned out great! I cut the amount of chicken in half and added lots of vegetables. I used mushrooms broccoli and red pepper but I think any veggie would be good. Some reviews said it was a little bland so added a little red pepper flakes which gave it a nice kick.

I used extra light olive oil instead of peanut oil, and cooking sherry intead of Shao-Hsing cooking wine, also 2 to 3 tbsp. of minced garlic because this is what I had on hand. I simmered on med low, uncovered for the 20 minutes. Served with steamed Jasmine rice (my favorite). My picky husband and 7 year old grandson LOVED it. I steamed sliced carrots with a little butter (we only use real butter) and those went over well also. Great meal! Next time I won't be using the salt since soy sauce is already salty enough. Bad for my high blood pressure. 1 serving of this recipie with 1 cup of Jasmine rice is about 320 calories, and is heart healthy too! For dessert I made a strawberry, kiwi, spinach smoothie with 1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla for my husband and I 165 calories. 30 calories for the serving of carrots. 515 deliciously healthy calories for the meal.

This was absolutely great! A few significant changes: I threw some whole dried red peppers the mexican type you find at the grocery stores in with the whole garlic to add some heat. Some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I toasted some sesame seeds and sprinkled those over the top after dishing. Easily the best Chinese dish I've ever made.

This is very good. Didn't change a thing. Made it for my husband dad and kids (5 & 2) and everyone loved it. My husband and dad kept saying "mmmm" the whole time they ate! Served it with white rice chinese salad and lean cuisine spring rolls. It's such a quick and easy recipe to prepare...I definitely will make it again.

This recipe had very good flavor and cured my craving for Chinese food. I used half of the recomended garlic and I will still have to warn my co-workers but it was tasty and easy to make. I also added a little vinegar and sugar because I like my sauce a bit sweet and I added carrots and broccoli for crunch. I will make this again!

Kind of wonky. Why would you bread chicken and then simmer it in broth?! Although no breading was left on the chicken at least it gave the resulting sauce some body. Flavor was good technique aside.

This is a new favorite at my house! I followed the recipe exactly but used sherry instead of the Chinese wine. Served the chicken over rice with cabbage green beans onions green peppers mushrooms and water chestnuts. It was amazing!

Decent recipe. I added broccoli for some vegetables and added about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic as it was simmering. Very subtle flavor and not very bold. Probably should've added some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Still a good easy dinner
