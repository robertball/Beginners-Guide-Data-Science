These little guys are amazing. I want to try and play with the recipe a little more and swap the condensed milk with a vanilla protein powder. Also maybe try with less honey to cut down on the sugar when I do I will post how they turned out!!

Very quick and easy.  My teenage son wanted me to try some healthier sweet recipes.  This one is a keeper. Next time I am going to try adding sunflower seeds for more protein.

Absolutely delicious. I made the mistake of only making half the recipe since I wasn't sure how they would come out! I will DEFINITELY be making these again. The texture after they solidify in the freezer is really nice - chewy, firm, but still soft somehow. They remind me of a pulverized PB & Honey Sandwich. My 16-year old son and 16-month old daughter approved as well. :)

My students made this in class, it was a favorite because of its similarity to cookie dough--very moist.  We added mini chocolate chips as it was being mixed--turned out great.

Easy to make. I wrapped each one individually and they are great for on the go breakfasts!

Thank you for this easy & delicious recipe. I just discovered the recipe & have made these twice within 24hrs (yes, they are that good). The first time I followed the recipe precisely, the next time I added a little less honey & it was still delicious. I couldnâ€™t find the toasted wheat germ so I put wheat germ on a baking sheet & baked it for a few minutes.

this is great!  I used a homemade blend of almond/ macadamia nut butter instead of peanut butter. I also swapped out the milk powder for Vegan protein powder.   proportions are good.  thanks for the recipe!
