I have made this cheesecake several times and it has been devoured each time.  The important thing to note is that it must be refrigerated overnight because thickening occurs as it gets COLD, not as it cools in the oven to room temperature.  I think the first reviewer did NOT follow the instructions on cooling properly. You must make this recipe the day before it is to be served or it will not be firm enough to cut properly.

It also tastes good and looks beautiful without the blueberry topping- substitute drizzled caramel topping as used in the crust.

With some alterations.  Eliminated one egg.  I used 3 eggs and 2 egg yolks.  I cooked it according to the instructions, but after an hour it was still very loose. Raised the temp to 325 degrees and cooked for another 15 to 20 minutes (watch over it). When golden and appeared more firm, I lowered temp back to 275 for about 10 minutes to ensure filling was set. Followed cooling directions as written.  For topping, I substituted the blueberries with strawberries and then drizzled melted white chocolate over top for presentation.  Also did not use almonds in the crust.  GOT RAVE REVIEWS FROM GUESTS.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.

I followed the directions on the crust, and the cooking time and I even took an extra step and whipped creme for an additional topping. When this cheesecake cooled, it was runny and undone. (in fact, I had left it in the oven for an additional 5 min. cooking time before I turned off the oven and let it cool in there)  I felt like it was a waste of ingredients and it was a dessert for company so it was disappointing to cut into it and have the consistancy of pudding.  Due to all the egg yolk and eggs in it, I scraped off the whip creme and returned it to the oven and sent company home without dessert. For cheesecake it had the appearance of being done-but was runny on the inside and the crumbs didn't hold together like a cheesecake crust should-it was like sand.  Too much work-too expensive-too bad!  I cannot think of anything I did wrong on this recipe.

This was excellent. I also increased the oven temperature to 300 degrees and kept it in about 10 minutes longer. I found that I had to double the clarified butter to get the crust to a consistency that I could press it into the pan - but it was great. I think I will double the sauce next time - I ran out and had to use pie filling - the sauce is truly worth it.  It was quite big so I cut it into slices and froze it - it thawed beautifully. My husband raved about it!

Fantastic. This is my first time baking a whole cheesecake and i couldn't be more pleased. i baked it for my sister's birthday celebration and all her friends loved it and complimented me profusely...(one even cliamed he was going to have a food orgasm haha)I followed the recipe exactly (except I did not have a food processor so I used my blender for the crust) but found that I had to bake it for an extra 20 minutes or so at 300 degrees, then turned off oven and left cake inside to let it cool for about half an hour before opening the door a crack. I let it sit like that for approximately another hour, then took it out and let it sit on the counter for a bit to finish cooling. I did not have time to refrigerate it overnight, but the few hours it had in the fridge was enough. I could not believe it: no cracks (even though I was lazy and did not use a water bath) and no sinking! I smothered some blueberry topping around the border, drizzled on melted white chocolate chips, wrote on it with icing and garnished it with 16 blueberries that I saved, it looked really nice and tasted even better. Oh yeah and I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, yum! My friends and I are both raving over this cheesecake, look how long this comment is! Excellent recipe, I only wish I could give more than 5 stars! I will definitely be using this recipe again and again! THanks Scott for a great recipe!

This was very very very good, and I got rave reviews at the potluck I took it too.  I used canned blueberry pie filling for the topping, because I had it on hand and actually was looking for a recipe to use it in when I found this one... It is a little time consuming, and truthfully there are other similar recipes on this site that you get *almost* as good results, so I'm not sure how often I will take the extra time to make it, but it will stay in my books as one of my all time best creations!  :)

This was absolutely fantastic.  EVERYONE loved it.  I melted the white chocolate in the microwave on med-high for about 4 minutes total, stiring every minute.  The taste is like from a fine restaurant.  I would have cooked it a little longer before turning oven off and opening the door.  Texture would have been a little firmer.  But I definately would make it again.

The recipe is a good one but the cook time and temp are inaccurrate. So anyone who thinks they did something wrong - it's not you.

There's 2 lbs of cheese in the recipe. You need at least a 325 degree oven and 1 hour cook time. If you opt for 275, then bake it for 2 hours.

At the end of an hour at 325, turn the oven off, crack the door and set the timer for another hour. Refrigerate the cake overnight - then remove from the springform pan.  

p.s: add freshly ground nutmeg to the blueberry mixture. The nutmeg brings out the flavor of the blueberries. :)

I made this cheesecake for our church's 4th of July baking contest and won a blue ribbon!    It turned out perfectly with the additional 20 minutes in the oven.   Very yummy!

This was fantastic.  I savored every bite (and took too many).  It was my first cheesecake and I followed the suggestions to cook it longer.  We liked the fact that the cake was not as dense as what you would get in a restaurant.  And the crust was outstanding.  One comment, I did have to work to  get the caramel evenly distributed throughout the crust.  And I had to look up how to clarify butter.  But it was worth it.  And I never expected a cheesecake to be easy.  

Also, one of my cream cheese blocks was 1/3 less fat.  It did not seem to affect the flavor at all.

I decided after reading the reviews to make this recipe exactly as listed with all ingredients, hoping that it would set properly.  If you leave it in the oven with the door only slightly cracked, that will finish setting the cheesecake - just make sure to use the 10 inch springform pan as stated or it won't set.  Chilling it in the fridge is also crucial when you take it out of the cooled down oven.  Very rich (and I even added a little extra white chocolate to the mix) and creamy.  The blueberry sauce is a really nice complement to the white chocolate.

I made this last night and couldn't wait to cut into it this morning.. It is delicious and my family loves it! I baked it for an hour at 275 degrees and it was very loose in the middle.  So I turned the temp up to 300 and left it in there for another 20-25 minutes and checked it constantly.. The cheesecake and blueberry sauce is awesome, but my crust came out VERY chewy and even a bit hard in some places.. I'm sure it was something I did to it! Hopefully the crust will be better next time.. Will make this again and again!!

Oh my goodness - this is wonderful! This is the first cheesecake recipe I've tried where the cake did not come out all cracked and dried up. It was flawless. I think it makes a great base for trying lots of different variations/tops.

So delicious.  I'm not sure how I did it but we ended up with two cheesecakes from once recipe so we added a little more crust and did a second one!  Everyone loved it and has been bugging us to make more!

This cheesecake is worth spending the extra dollars and buying premium white chocolate.  The crust is unique and the caramel sauce makes it a little chewy.  The cheesecake itself is wonderful, but it's firm and that's an understatement.  After 24hrs in the fridge, it's solid as a rock!  I made this in a smaller pan than recommended and it really needs the 10" because of the firmness.  This cheesecake is at it's best when it's soft and creamy....and that it is!  You just have to take it out prior to serving.  The closer it gets to room temperature, the creamier it gets.  It was a huge hit and people raved over it.

the cake is wicked tasty, but the directions need some tweaks:

prep time is way over 20 minutes! it takes nearly that long to melt the chocolate which doesn't even start until after you've melted/clarified the butter and made the crust and then there's all the unwrapping cream cheese and separating eggs still to come.

there's absolutely no need to preheat a 275 degree oven until after the filling is made - why have it sit there heating away?

finally, the cake goes too soft too quickly, so eat it up!

Ok - so I made this last night and served it to my dear hubby tonight and it was a big success! I also think it came out great, but I made some changes and wanted to add that to the reviews. First off, I didn't use graham crackers for the crust. Instead I used shortbread cookies and omitted all of the other crust ingredients except the butter. I loved this! For the actual cheesecake I followed the directions as stated on the recipe except I reduced the amount of white chocolate I added as hubby and I aren't huge fans of white chocolate. I bought a big bag of Nestle White Chocolate Chips as there was no other white chocolate available in the grocery store. The bag was 1lb and 8 oz I believe. I used maybe half of the bag. As for baking the cheesecake, I did 30 mins at 275 and then turned it up to 300 for the remaining 30 mins. After an hour I turned off the oven and kept the door closed for 30 mins. Then I opened the door partially for the next 30 mins. Following this cool down I put it on the counter and soon after was able to put it in the fridge overnight. I think the recipe was great with these few changes and I will probably make this again when we have an event to go to or something as 2 people really can't eat a whole cheesecake! Oh...I also didn't have a sieve to run the topping through but it was perfect the way it was.

Delicious, beautiful and easy to make! I'm a firefighter and made this for our Chief's retirement dinner. There were only seven of us at the dinner and three said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. Our Chief asked for the recipe and our Sergeant keeps asking for it. I'm not sure what you know about firefighters....but they know how to eat and eat well!   I haven't made many cheesecakes, but the directions were very clear and I followed them exactly. I did use high end white chocolate which made this rather expensive.  Will try with white chocolate chips next time and see if there is a significant difference. Enjoy!

I thought this cheesecake was too sweet for my liking and I have a sweet tooth. It also didn't set like I thought.  It was still too  much like pudding instead of the cheesecake texture.  If I make it again I will use less white chocolate and more cream cheese.  The crust was grerat..I kept out the nuts and so was the topping!

I have never attempted to make a cheesecake before, but made this for my friend's birthday.  The only issue I had was that the crust came out quite hard, but that was probably because I just used regular margarine instead of clarified butter as I was not familiar with the process.  I put a few of the berries (I used mixed blueberries and blackberries, I believe) in the middle after pouring in half of the cheesecake.  Everyone LOVED it! My husband has requested I make it again for his birthday this weekend.

WONDERFUL recipe!  My family loved it!  I made the recipe as stated, but wraped the outside of the springform pan in foil, then placed it in a larger pan and added boiling water to the other pan, to about half way up the side of the spring form pan.  I also cooked the cheesecake in a 325 degree oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes, then turned off the oven and let it cool as per instructions.  It turned out perfect - totally done and it didn't sink at all.  I will definately make this again!

Best Cheesecake Ever! I am a cheesecake lover and have made many, many, many different types, but this one was definately my favorite.  The flavor of the cheesecake was amazing and the blueberry topping was to die for.  I didn't follow the recipe for the crust.  I just made my own graham cracker crust.  It turned out wonderfully.  I will definately be making this one again!

With the holiday season fast approaching I made this but instead of blueberries I used fresh cranberries that I made into cranberry sauce.  Once the sauce chilled I then followed directions as with the blueberries.  When serving I made a Cranbery Coulis and served over the top.  A coulis is the sauce pureed in a blender to form a thick syrup.  Then I pased it through a colander and voila the Cranberry Colis.  It was a hugh success.

The carmel and almonds in the crust were outstanding.  This made three cheesecakes!  But I didn't use a springform pan.  Very good recipe!

This is the first baked cheesecake I've ever made.  Followed recipe exactly as written.  Came out perfectly...without any cracks.  So easy and absolutely sinful!

This cheesecake is absolutely AMAZING!  I just had the first piece and it was delectable.  I just used a pre-made crust and Ghirardelli white chocolate chips and it turned out great!  I was actually able to make two cheesecakes out of this recipe because of, I think, using the pre-made graham cracker crust.  Great recipe!!

I wanted a variation from the typical cherry cheesecake I normally make. This cheesecake was absolutely delicious! I needed to make it quickly so I used a store bought premade crust and canned blueberry topping. If you didn't know there was white chocolate in there you probably wouldn't know when eating it but it was still really tasty! Definitely recommend this dessert! Thank you.

It was delicious! I got great reviews from my family. Just don't make the mistake I did of using an 8 inch springform pan instead of a 10, because it will spill out the side.

Delicious! Made it in a deep dish pie crust (made 2 cheesecakes).  Fantastic with the blueberry sauce and a bit of homemade whipped cream!  Will definitely make it again.

my family loved it!! It was a great recipe, but I kept the cheescake in the oven a little bit longer, and at 300 degrees.  You also have to refridgerate it overnight, or it will not turn out. great cheesecake!!

I have made this cheesecake countless times.  I do use it as a base and mix things up a bit.  I add different types of chocolates, extracts and or crusts.  It has worked for me every time.  One of the variations I use is using semi-sweet choco chips in place of the white chocolate and heath candy pieces for the topping with drizzles of caramel on top...yummy!

This is a fantastic cheesecake recipe.  I, too, had to add ten minutes to the cooking time but it was worth the wait.  I didn't make the blueberry topping; instead I made a white chocolate ganache.  The only other thing I would change would be the crust.  I doubled the amount of butter and it still crumbled and wouldn't hold together.  Overall, great recipe...definitely a keeper.

I have made cheesecakes in the past and overall this is a pretty good recipe. 
I will agree that it takes longer than 20 minutes to prepare. It took me about 40 minutes.
The crust: DELICIOUS! I thought it was going to be crumby but it did nice and crunchy in the oven and did not fall apart. 
Filling: Overall pretty good. It tasted more like a plain cheesecake to me but Im not sure if it is because I used nestle white chocolate chips rather than the more expensive chocolates. Texture was great, and was still tasty even though it lacked white chocolate flavor. I used a vanilla bean paste so that made up for it.
Topping: I used a different topping I found here on allrecipes and it was excellent. It had orange juice, water, cornstarch, sugar, blueberries, cinnamon, and almond extract. 
I baked my cheesecake in a dark coated non stick pan at 275* in a convection oven for 1 hour. It came out perfect. Convection ovens do cook faster and more evenly so if you are using a regular oven or a light pan I would suggest upping the temp and cook time as a lot of other reviewers state.

I agree the person that had a problem with consistency must have not chilled it overnight

Excellent cheesecake recipe. Be careful with the center though because it sometimes does not set right with all of the melted chocolate in the mixture.

I made this cheesecake and it lasted about 10 minutes!  I made a change in the crust, using crushed Oreos and butter, and it was wonderful!  My b/f's family is always raving about their friend's cheesecakes and they told me I put his to shame!  I was gloating, of course.  I drizzled the top of this one with white chocolate instead of the blueberry sauce because not everyone likes blueberries.  Wonderful.  Can't wait to make again!!!  i made it once with Hershey's white chips and they didn't melt, so don't use them, just an FYI!!

There's only one word for this dessert:  WOW!!! The only change I make is I use pie filling for the top. I didn't like how the topping turned out the first time I made it, so I changed it and it's still as good as ever! Next time I'm going to change the flavor of the topping for variety. Thanks for this one!!!

Wonderful, I made mini cheesecakes instead of a big one, which worked well.
I did find the cheesecake mix to be a little bit to sweet but my husband and I did enjoy them.

This cheesecake has a great flavor, the white chocolate does not overpower the cheese flavor, but I found the texture to be too dense. Overall my family enjoyed it.

Every person at my dinner party (8) raved!  Several couldn't believe it was homemade, they were sure it was purchased.
(its alot of work, but worth it)
The only thing I would add, is the blueberry sauce is so delicious, we ran out before the cake was finished.  I would increase the sauce by 50% next time I make it.

I took the advice of only using 3 eggs and the two yolks. I also baked at 300 for an hour and a half. After one hour and 15 minutes (as it began to get golden), I began checking the center every few minutes with a toothpick to check the consistency, it took the extra 15 minutes or so to firm up a bit. All ovens cook differently and you should ALWAYS check the consistency of your cakes before removing them from the oven (that's just for those that complained about the center being too loose). The blueberry sauce was perfect and I mixed some whole blueberries up in it for the perfect topping. The cake was gone in a matter of 20 minutes at a party that I brought it to and other people are now placing orders. Excellent flavor combination!

Excellent cheesecake!  I have made several cheesecakes, and this was the firmest one I have ever made - it didn't even stick to the knife when I cut it into slices.  I did not even refrigerate it overnight - just for a couple of hours!  It was a big hit.  The blueberries made all of our teeth and lips black.  I did find that the amount of blueberry sauce was not enough for the entire cake.  There was leftover cheesecake, but I will have to make more blueberry sauce.

My husband said this was the best dessert I had ever made!  (I used 2 ready made graham cracker pie pans and didn't press the blueberries through a sieve.  The left over blueberry sauce was great over waffles too!)

Came out delicious! I only used 11oz white chocolate, but came out fine since I only used a 9” springform pan. Had to leave it in about 15 extra minutes to make sure it would set up.

Out of all the cheesecakes I have made this one has received the most praise for texture and taste!  Basically perfect though I added lemon zest and nutmeg to the compote to boost the flavor.  Make sure you use a water bath.  The 10in pan is absolutely necessary as it is a big cheesecake.  Sooo good.

Wow! Wow! WOW! The blueberry topping on this cheesecake hits the spot in so many ways. The cheesecake was phenomenal by itself but that topping is to die for. Heck even if you bought a store bought cheesecake, make this topping and pour it over the store bought. WINNER WINNER HERE!

The only change I would make next time is to decrease amount of graham cracker crumbs - my crust seemed a little thick - I went up the sides completely too! Cheesecake itself was wonderful!

I halved the recipe because there are only 2 of us. Except for the flour, since other reviews said it could be a bit thin.

I made this recently for my boyfriend's sister's birthday. Followed the recipe exactly and baked for slightly more than 1 hour (probably just 5-10 mins longer), left in the oven with the oven off and the oven door 1 inch open for 1 hour, and then let it cool to room temperature for at least an hour or so. Left in the fridge overnight and heated up the blueberry sauce a bit before serving and placing on top. The whole family raved about how great this cheesecake was saying it was restaurant quality and the best cheesecake they've ever had. This was my first time baking a cheesecake so I was very happy. One thing to note, I did not make my own clarified butter because I happened to buy some from Trader Joe's a while ago. Made the prep much easier. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!

Amazing.  First time we made a cheesecake and coming back to make it for family.  I love the reviews  as they range from too thick to pudding.   We followed the directions to the tee and the results were an awesome delicious creamy cheesecake.  Not sure what others did wrong but you might want to research what makes a cheesecake runny.

Have made this several times to rave reviews.  The only thing I changed the second time was I used the cinnamon graham crackers which gave it an extra boost and added about 10 more minutes to cooking  The other thing is it's so easy to make

I did cook it the additional 20 minutes and this one received the highest reviews in my house of all the ones i've made so far. I also used the water bath with a water filled dish underneath and it came out flawless. The topping was so good, my kid made me get more blueberries and make it for his waffles too!

I have made this cheese cake several times (it's a birthday favorite) over the last few years and have never had any problems with the recipe.  I am always pressed for time so it's always made a day before so maybe that's why it sets up beautifully for us  This has become my standard for making cheese cake with various toppings (depending on which family member is requesting it's tastes)

Oh my!  I've made a lot of cheesecakes in my life, but this one is THE BEST.  I only made one change, I toasted my almonds.  I agree with the others that said, make it the day before, it's so much better!

Soo good!!! The crust was crumbly and it was way more than would fit in a springform, so I used a large cake pan. It turned out fantastic. Better than restaurant quality, and I had never made cheesecake before.

I love this recipe. Based on reviews, I increased my cooking temp to 350 and I used a store brought crust (fills two graham cracker pie shells). I kept the filling and the topping the same. It came out amazing.  This is my favorite dessert. So simple and absolutely delicious.

this was AMAZING! it was my first time baking anything and I was 100% sure it wouldn't taste like a cheesecake at all. BUT IT DID! and so easy to make too. I refrigerated it overnight and it had set perfectly! the crust was a bit heavy but It was most likely me making it too thick!
