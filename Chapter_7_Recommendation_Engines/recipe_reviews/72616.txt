I work in food service in a natural foods store, and the trick to getting tofu firm, not mushy, is baking it first.  We do that for all tofu we use.  You just cut it how you want to, spray a baking sheet with oil, and bake on 375 for about 15 minutes, more depending on how firm and crispy you want it. 
Anyway, I baked it, coated it in the egg and bbq sauce mixture, rolled in flour mix and fried.  It was great.

This is THE BBQ tofu recipe!!!  I live in memphis and I swear it's better than any other BBQ anything out there.  I did bake for 15 minutes before coating in egg/sauce and flour mix and frying.  The tofu was very crispy at that point.  I cooled pieces on paper towel to soak up some oil and then coated with Corky's BBQ sauce and placed on a well greased pan and put back in the oven for about 5 minutes.  (I'm not sure about broiling) When they came out of the oven I thought they were ruined because they were no longer crispy but I'm telling you the texture is right on! All the consistency of chicken wing meat without big veins hanging out, chunks of cartilege and other assorted nasty things associated with actual meat.  THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for the first tofu recipe I actually like better than the real thing!!!!

The ingredients list flour/salt/pepper but the instructions never tell what to do with them, they are crucial to the crispiness.  So after rolling in the egg white mixture roll in flour/salt/pepper mixture, then fry, will be crispy and absolutely delicious!  My husband loved this and I didn't even do the last step adding more BBQ sauce, didn't need it!

We loved this! But you do have to bake the tofu first as another reviewer suggested, otherwise your tofu will not be crispy.

Great Recipe.  I'm fairly new to cooking with tofu and have found getting it to be crispy has been one of the harder skills to learn.  Coating the tofu with egg does the trick and, if desired, you can use breading and various other seasonings instead of flour and bbq sauce.

Very good and easy.  Dredge the tofu first in the eggs, then in the flour/salt/pepper mix.  Don't be afraid to brown this.  The more it gets brown, the more it gets crispier.

I really liked this recipe!  I used teriyaki sauce instead of BBQ and it was also very good.  I didn't freeze the tofu beforehand, but I don't need the "meaty" texture.  It was very fast and easy to make with little clean-up required.

Very good.  I hadn't heard of freezing tofu for a meatier texture.  I will use that trick with more recipes now.  Thanks!

Used this recipe as a base. Sliced, squeezed out excess water and baked the tofu 30 minutes at 350F (too long; maybe only 20 minutes max next time). I dipped my tofu slices in a soy milk/hot sauce mixture then double-dipped in a flour/cornstarch/S&P/Italian seasoning mix. Fried until golden. Completely skipped the BBQ sauce and didn't miss. it. These tasted like chicken nuggets, so even my toddler like them!

I actually just made this an hour or two ago and it was FAB!I screwed up and got the extra firm organic sprouted tofu twin pack of 8 ounce tofu so I couldn't make slices so I made strips! I did like the other reviewers said and placed a block in between two paper towels and weighed it down with a glass pot. Then, I left to go back to Trader Joe's to get some yummy all natural barbecue sauce. When I came back  the towels were literally drenched! I don't know how all that water hides in there. I cut my strips and put some foiled on a cookie sheet and baked for 15 mins. Took them out dipped in the egg mixture and the flour and placed in the pan. Medium low is best. Let them brown, added barbecue sauce on them after they drained on paper towels and placed them back in the for five and only five minutes because at this point I was dying to try them! I'm certainly glad I did. Next time I will get the extra firm block to try these on a sandwich. I paired my strips with baby spinach and a dollop of roasted garlic hummus.

This recipe is ridiculous! Ive always loved bbq sauce, but being a vegetarian has really limited what I can do with it, but this recipe has completely changed that! I loved it so much, after the first time I tried it, I made it three days in a row!

We loved this recipe! Awesome texture.  I froze the tofu 2 nights before and baked the tofu as suggested by another reviewer.  It was quite time consuming with the freezing, thawing, baking, frying and baking but worth the effort.   I omitted the egg for the batting, instead used a tablespoon of flour and 1/4 c water and they still came out well.    We only used 1/2 cup flour for the batter and more than 3tbsp of the oil.

This will be bland without the BBQ sauce! I didn't have enough sauce so here's what I did: I suggest sprinkling salt and pepper before baking it for 15-20 in the oven. I omitted the BBQ sauce the second time I made it because it was too subtle. I dipped the tofu in egg white then dipped it in a mixture of breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan cheese. I then pan-fried it and only flipped it after the under side has been browned. Enjoy and goodluck!

"Crispy" is not a term usually associated with tofu, but it is possible with this recipe. I used "Dinosaur Roasted Garlic Honey BBQ Sauce". Delicious, and thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe numerous times. My family loves it. It's  one of our favorite ways to prepare tofu.  To save time, try using Trader Joes high protein tofu. It's so firm and dry, you don't need to press it.

They turned out delicious! My non-vegetarian family loved them too! I also recommend baking the tofu for 15 minutes to make the consistency even better!

100% Awesome! I baked the tofu first, as another reviewer suggested. After breading & frying I simply tossed the pieces in more BBQ sauce. No need for the broiler since the piping hot tofu made the sauce warm. Delish!

I'll just say this; if you are one of the millions of Americans with a REAL bbq outside, marinade in some BBQ sauce and toss them on the grill. This recipe is a lot of work, for a not so great result (in my opinion).

I am not experienced in tofu preparation but I really enjoyed making this recipe. I baked the tofu as suggested by other reviewers for about 20 minutes in a convection oven, then proceeded with the recipe using a teriyaki sauce instead of bbq sauce. It came out great. The pieces that were cut thinner had a better texture, so next time I will try to cut the slices thinner. The teriyaki sauce I used was like a thick marinade, not the thin teriyaki sauce in a bottle like soy sauce. Next time I may slice the tofu, then freeze, then bake, just to see what happens to the texture.

AWESOME!!  This was my first time cooking with tofu.  As per previous reviews, I seasoned the tofu with garlic and onion powder as well as salt and pepper and baked for 15 mins at 375 degrees.  I then dredged the tofu in the egg mixture, almond flour, egg mixture, and Panko bread crumbs and fried in olive oil. SO CRISPY!! Did not broil.  Used bbq sauce for dipping. YUM!!

I really liked this , one thing for me is I found it to be a bit dry but that's probably my fault since I didn't freeze it but I baked it twice! I personally would do this again with egg substitute and without baking it to firm up the tofu at the beginning.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I'm not vegetarian but I cook with tofu sometimes because I like it. This recipe was a little tedious especially trying to dip slimy tofu into slimy egg without crushing the tofu. It was a delicate process and took me longer than I expected it would. I baked the tofu a little first to firm it up, breaded it, baked it a little more so the flour wouldn't come off when I added the bbq sauce, then baked it with the sauce until the sauce was caramelized into the tofu. The texture was pretty good once they were done. To me, as far as flavor goes, the tofu didn't seem to go well with the bbq sauce. Because of the trouble I probably won't cook it again, but it wasn't a total bust since my kids did like it.

I froze, I baked it, I egged and floured it, I fried it, I marinated it, and I broiled it.  And it was...terrible.  The texture was okay and the flavor was, well, icky.  Normally I think of tofu as having little flavor, but I got a strong tofu flavor with every bite.  Those who are giving this positive reviews are either tried and true vegetarians or lacking taste buds.  I rarely give bad reviews (I rarely find a recipe this bad that has so many good reviews), but this was really awful.  This was a whole lot of work for really disappointing results.  This will not be part of my 'meatless meals' rotation.  Blech.

As a vegetarian, I was determined to make my own tofu dish and this was my first. It's a bit of a task doing the pressing, but the end result is worth it. And baking the tofu before hand really helps. These were great with a jalapeño dipping sauce I threw together with bbq sauce, soy sauce and jalapeños.

Tasted like BBQ sauce.  Tofu has no taste so not too surprised at lack of flavour.  Tofu was SOGGY after thawing.  Better off pressing overnight to get out any extra water Or at least freeze and thaw on a cookie cooling rack.  Won't be making again.

This was fantastic! I skipped the freezing step and just drained and pressed firm, traditional tofu. I also omitted the egg, kind of defeats the purpose of an otherwise plant-based dish. You could just use BBQ sauce instead. I used an egg replacer (Ener-G) and BBQ sauce. LOVED this dish!!

This was very good. I made this for memorial day weekend. I have a vegetarian in the family (including myself) who loved them as well. I will definitely make them again. And i would also recommend freezing them the night before. It helps with the texture. I did manage to to burn them a little bit while i was frying them so i never broiled them but they were still amazing. =D

This was AWESOME! I've been looking for recipes to make tofu edible and this it it. I actually left out the egg (didn't have any) and just dipped the tofu in BBQ sauce diluted a little bit with water and it still turned out fine. This does not reheat well though (even if you try to bake it). From now on I will only make as much as I can eat in one meal. Thanks!

I must be missing something here (where does the cup of flour go?) but mine came out mushy. It was a messy/ time consuming process. So you guys that gave it 4+ stars...please lend me a hand!

Wanted to love it but was not a fan :(  i really think tofu needs to be marinated before cooking to give it some flavor.  this was just bbq cover tofu to me.  texture after freezing, frying and broiling was nice but next time I will maybe marinate the strips in bbq then freeze and follow recipe.

I haven't ever managed to make tofu not look like scrambled eggs before now! Baking the tofu rectangles at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes before you dip them in the egg mixture most definitely helped the tofu have a crispier texture. Served the barbequed slices in a tortilla with fresh red bell pepper and mixed greens and a little bit of sharp cheddar. Everyone enjoyed even the meat eaters!

I did not have time to freeze tofu but I did cook it for 15 min at 375 beforehand. Excellent! Husband is not vegetarian and he ate most of it... Def. Making this again.

I'm new to tofu and still am up in the air about it.  This was a nice recipe, but even after all the draining, smushing, frying, and broiling, only the corners of these were "crispy."  It was very time consuming and I didn't feel like there was much to show for it after.  The taste really just depends on your choice of bbq sauce, so that wasn't an issue, but we were trying these mostly for the promised crispy texture.

not great, not bad... bbq sauce tastes good in general, so it was okay, but i've had better... maybe as a sandwich it would have more depth to the flavor

Wow, what a great recipe!  The freezing and pre-baking techniques are sheer genius and help push me one step closer to meat free living.  This method of cooking tofu also allows for variance, I may try satay or curry, or experiment with various other bbq sauces for change.  Thanks.

I usually make a similar version of this that my kids call Tofu Nuggets...I just take the Tofu and drain it, pat it dry then dip in olive oil, then bread crumbs, and bake it for 10-15 min on each side at around 425 deg.  It always comes out great and I have fed it to tons of kids and they always love it (thinking it's chicken nuggets;). And I have to say, although a bit more complicated this was excellent!

Turned out okay but when I put it in the broiler the tofu ended up burning. My boyfriend normally doesn't like tofu because of the texture and he thought that freezing it really helped. Will make again.

waaaay too much work for how it turned out.  followed recipe exactly.  3 Tbsp oil - used way more or else they were going to burn/didn't state how big to slice them so i had to guess.  there's gotta be a better way to do this!  boring bbq.

omg. this was awesome. i had a package of tofu in the freezer already, so i drained and pressed the water out, then sliced into strips. like another reviewer suggested, i baked the strips for about 15 minutes on each side, then followed the recipe for dredging and frying them. i got lazy at the end and just ate the fried strips on a bun with some more barbeque sauce and it was heavennn.

We're not vegetarian but my family including my picky 6 yr. old daughter really liked these tofu slices.  I didn't freeze the tofu overnight but did put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 to dry it out a bit before slicing. It was really tasty, and not mushy at all.  I will definitely make it again.

This really is a great dish - tempts the most hardcore omnivores to switch to veg!  I added powdered 1/4 teaspoon powdered garlic and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the egg mixture to give it some *kick*!

This has become a recurring favourite at our house. We gave up meat as a family and every now and again we miss some of our old comfort foods like BBQ wings or ribs. This is a great meal when we want something quick and familiar. The secret is finding a good quality Tofu. Firm but still gives easily to the touch and not lumpy and grainy in texture.

This was very delicious.  The only change I made was I baked my tofu at 375 for 15 minutes before I sautéed it.  My hubby has never wanted to try tofu now loves it!  Well cooked this way at least.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

This was sooo yummy! Even all my meat-eating friends and boyfriend loved it! They couldn't believe it was tofu. 

Although it was a relatively easy recipe, my only complaint was it was so messy! BBQ sauce and flour were everywhere.

I also couldn't figure out where the flour went in the recipe. FYI- After you dip the tofu slices in the egg mixture, coat them with flour before placing it in the skillet.  

I will be making this one again!

I love tofu, and am always on the prowl for new great tofu dishes, but I did not care for this recipe.  The egg coating made a gummy, NOT crispy coating, even though it was cooked so much it was burning (granted, I didn't freeze the tofu in advance, a have tried this before and prefer the natural texture of tofu).  Barely edible, I can't figure out why it has any positive reviews.  If you are looking for a great tofu recipe from allrecipes, try  "Breaded, Fried, Softly Spiced Tofu"--this DOES turn out crispy, and is delicious.

The flavor was very weird and the crispy outside does not sufficiently combat the completely squishy inside. Also, it took FOREVER to prepare. I really don't recommend this recipe. Sorry.

So, this is my first time cooking tofu and I thought this recipe was pretty easy but uhm.....yuck, but i think maybe i just dont like the tofu because i LOVE bbq sauce. I used to think bbq sauce could make anything taste good....i was wrong.

Wasn't sure how it would turn out as I've never breaded tofu, but it was amazing! No complaints, I added a few different spices to give it more flavor and I baked the tofu before breading but I'll definitely be making this again. My only complaint was that it was time consuming to batter and fry everything. I found it was more flavorful the next day when I reheated my leftovers.

This turned out beautifully! I don't like BBQ sauce/flavor, so I mixed sriracha sauce and another hot sauce into the egg white instead. I didn't do the second coating/marinade because I was worried they'd turn out too mushy. I broiled the toasty suckers dry, flipped once, and served with more hot sauce and ranch for dipping. They were chewy and dense - much more like real chicken I think the freezing did the trick - although, I just friar them quickly on a cookie sheet for an hour because I didn't have time.  And very crunchy (I also added a tablespoon of corn starch to the flour mixture.).

I followed the advice of many people and baked the tofu strips (at 425F for 20 minutes) before frying them.  After the strips were fried and the sauce was applied I baked them again (again at 425F) rather than putting them under the broiler.  I left them in the oven until the edges of the barbeque sauce blackened slightly.  I am so happy with how they turned out!  I will make these over and over again.  I will also try other sauces such as sweet and sour, peanut, curry, and teriyaki.

These were kind of a lot of work to produce something that I didn't feel was that much better than if you were to just marinate in bbq sauce and broil.  They were a hit at my party though!

After reading the reviews I was really excited by this, but I ended up disappointed.  It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything to get excited about either.  I think I'll try it again but marinate the tofu overnight, and I think I might try grilling it.  As it was it tasted like tofu with BBQ sauce on it.  Not a bad thing, but not something that's going to absolve my meat cravings.

Do freeze the tofu as instructed; it really makes the texture great.  This is an easy recipe that makes tofu a delicious main dish.

This is my first attempt at making tofu and eating it. It was great...on the outside. But for some reason the inside was really bland. Does anyone know what I can do to make the inside just as awesome as the outside? Maybe a marinade? Any ideas would be awesome. Thanks. Also my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this and are happy that our first tofu experience was pretty tasty.

I like the concept of this recipe, and it was good. I will say though that the tofu soaks up so much of the oil, it was kind of disturbing! I think that the dredging and frying didn't really result in a texture that was any better than the freeze/thaw/press/bake method of preparing tofu. I'll stick with that next time-makes it healthier and just as tasty!

Baking the tofu is definitely the way to go (15-20 min. at 375 degrees)! After browning the tofu I didn't see the need to broil it.

My only complaint about this recipe is that I could not stop eating the slices lol. My daughter has never been a fan of Tofu but she ate her BBQ slices and said that she likes them. YEA!! 

When I prepared them I was a bit nervous at first because the slices had that soft texture after I broiled them. Then I thought of just baking them in the oven and then I started reading other reviews about baking them so I felt better about making the decision to bake them. They turned out crispy and great! Who would have thought that Tofu could taste so good. :-)

These were so good! I unfortunately only had cubed tofu but was determined to make these. I baked the cubes for about 20 mins based on other reviews & added honey to the BBQ. They were a great texture, but I didn't see a need for the BBQ sauce in the egg mixture. After frying them, I tried one & it had no flavor. So I threw them all into the remaining BBQ & honey mixture & they came out great! They became a bit hard as they cooled, but I'm blaming that on the cubes. I plan to make this again this week with regular tofu! Thank you :)

Very tasty!!! I actually skipped the first step due to time and just blotted the tofu. I used firm. It all tasted great! My BF, who's vegetarian loved it! Next time I'll use extra firm so that its more substantial.

Fantastic recipe, good for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  The only thing I found off about this recipe was the amount of flour.  I only set out 1/2 cup and ended up throwing about half of it away.

Delicious recipe. I didn't follow exactly to a T, but it still came out great. I didn't freeze it because that's too much time. I did bake it for 15 minutes with bbq sauce on it. I used a whole egg for dipping and a little cornmeal. At first I didn't like the french toast appearance but then I tried it and the egg coating kind of feels like skin! My toddlers loved it and my husband will be pleased when he gets home. I also love the rich color I was able to achieve with this recipe.

This was my first attempt at cooking tofu and I liked this recipe pretty well!  I took other reviewers' advice and baked the tofu for 15 min. before following the recipe.

This is better if it is sliced thin. I didn't freeze but baked for 15min on a greased cookie sheet like suggested. My husband and I really liked it. I made it with my homemade BBQ sauce.

With a newly vegetarian daughter, I am trying to find meals we can all eat. This is one for sure! My carnivorous son went back for seconds. I baked the tofu for 15 minutes then dipped and fried the pieces and then broiled them again with the extra bbq sauce brushed on.  They came out crunchy and delicious. I will be making this again and often.

Great Recipe! I get many compliments. I freeze the tofu before hand as well as bake it for 15 minutes before frying. Make sure to cut the slices thick enough to not burn while baking.

These were a huge hit at our house. We used Ener-G Egg replacer instead of egg white and doubled the egg white/barbeque mixture that you dip them in. Even our pickiest kids ate these.

Since I'm vegan I used the ener-G egg replacer instead of an egg white, and since there was no black pepper in the house I used some red pepper and barbecue seasoning.  Also, I didn't follow the directions exactly.  When under the broiler I added more barbecue sauce on each side.  Anyway, when I first made it and put it under the broiler, the sauce burned on each side and I thought I had done something wrong, but it turned out alright.  My grandparents LOVED them.  My carnivorous grandpa ate more than me and my vegan grandma and he had plenty of barbecued lamb, ribs, and chicken at his disposal.     Other than the overnight freezing, this dish is quick and quite easy to make, and tasty to boot. :)  I have another block of tofu in the freezer right now!

my husband loved and raved about this. It's easy! However, I felt the tofu needed something more. Maybe a little marinade. I will make it again though.

Although this is not a quick weeknight meal, my family loved this!  My kids were fighting over the last couple of pieces!  I did what everyone else did with baking the tofu first, and then followed the rest of the recipe.  I was always afraid to try to make tofu at home, but this worked wonderfully.  Thanks!

I had never tried tofu before, but this sounded interesting.  My husband & I really liked it!  The only thing I noticed was I needed 2 egg whites and could have probably used only half the flour, the salt and pepper were lost in the extra.

Very good! I followed others suggestions and baked for 20 min. at 375. I didn't freeze it. Broiled them on low for 5 min on each side and they turned out nice and crispy. Whole family liked them, even the kids. Might try again with buffalo wing sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Didn't have bbq sauce on hand so made my own mixture, but the dipping of tofu in egg dipped flour prior to frying sure made a big difference!  Tofu wasn't as crispy as I would've liked...so next time I will try baking it first, as another reviewer suggests.

It was really hard getting this "crispy".  I baked the tofu before frying and perhaps 15 minutes wasn't long enough.  It was still pretty mushy.  After all was said and done the texture turned out okay. My husband really enjoyed this though. I think I'm just not that huge of a tofu fan.  I served it with potato salad for a real BBQ feel which was nice.  I will try this again I think I just need a little practice cooking with tofu.

Delicious! I did bake it before coating/frying it as others had recommended. I had seconds and will be making this again (even if it's just for one, as my meat eating husband wasn't sold).

WOW!  This was incredibly good.. a LOT of work, but very tasty! I did not freeze the tofu, but I drained it incredibly well getting out all excess water with paper towels.  I then cut it into 12 thin slices and baked for 15 minutes at 375. The key is to use your favorite BBQ sauce.. I use Sweet Baby Ray's and it's incredible! Instead of broiling, I just baked it for another 5 minutes at 375 after I was done with the frying.  Keep extra BBQ sauce on the side as well for when you're eating to dip it in there too! This is very good.  I served it with dinner rolls and rice.

I made this for lunch today and give it five stars because even my husband liked it.  Thanks to the previous reviewer for sharing the baking tip.  Instead of freezing the tofu, I baked the tofu at 375 on a lightly oiled baking pan, before doing the recipe.  This saves a lot of time too, no freezing the night before!

This is one of the best tofu recipes I have ever made!  Very crispy and just enough flavor from the barbecue sauce.  Excellent with rice and veggies on the side.  We will definitely make this again!

I used to be the only one that ate tofu, but now my son loves it too.  it's a great protein alternative, when I want something light.

Okay, you've made me a beliver in Tofu. I never lied it and this recipe has restored me from the nasty, unhealthy fried chicken i used to eat. I did all the steps in the recipe and used bbq sauce to dip my tofu slices. Everything came out nice and crispy (i did bake my tofu slices first), but overall wish I could give you more than 5 stars. This was sooo delish! Thanks.

Thanks so much for the yummy recipe! I did, of course, bake the tofu at 375 for around 20 minutes after it had frozen overnight.  If the recipe I mentioned that step, I might have given it the full five stars. One other disconcerting thing about this recipe is that it never mentions how thick to slice the tofu.  I think I made mine a little too thick, and it detracted from the potency of flavor.  Next time, I'll slice mine less than 1/2 inch thick.  I might also save this recipe for summer time-I don't have an exhaust fan above the stove, and my entire house is full of smoke and a greasy stench.  It's winter here in Wisconsin and I hate having to throw open all the windows, but it was definitely called for.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because of the mess my kitchen became after I finished making this. I did bake the tofu for 15 minutes at 375 as another commenter suggested. The flavor was good but next time I will add some spice to give it a kick. Went great with rice noodles and sweet and sour sauce to dip!

I didn't freeze it like the recipie says. I pressed the moisture out of my tofu strips and froze for 1 hour. Then, to be healthier, I baked them (at 375, like the other reviewer suggested). I baked them, flipped them, then coated with extra bbq sauce and stuck them back in the oven. They tasted good like that, but better after one day of being refrigerated. Next time I'll try freezing the tofu.  I used honey mustard for some of them, and they were good too!

This is a fantastic recipe! The tofu has a great texture. I baked before and after frying and added garlic powder and cayenne as suggested. I also cubed my tofu into 1/2 cubes then skewered two per toothpick.  This made frying them and turning them in the oven much easier!

6 minutes broiling is definitely too long. I'd do 4 minutes. Besides that, I'd imagine it's very good.

My first time cooking tofu myself. This recipe was very good. I did bake the tofu first, as others suggested, and it turned out wonderfully. I have made this a few times now, and think it will be used often.

Enjoyable meatless dish. I have only been using tofu for about 6 months so I am having fun experimenting. I tried this 20 other times and always threw it out but this recipe is good and I will eat tofu this way again. You really have to drain tofu well (at least an hour pressed) and then the baking of the tofu is a wonderful idea. I will always use that tip when I work with tofu. Thanks so much for the idea Amy. This is a time consuming but was nice and I will be using this recipe often.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I've been a non-tofu enjoying veggi for about 15 years. I'm always hopeful when I find a recipe that could disguise it's "tofu-ness".  This was AMAZING. My husband ate the entire plate, minus the 3 I quickly grabbed before he inhaled them. My 3 year old LOVED them (he managed to get 1). I baked the tofu after I brought it out of the freezer as was suggested. I will make these over and over and over...  THANK YOU!!

Since becoming a vegetarian, bbq is one of the things I miss the most. I tried this recipe with a few changes and both my 9 year old daughter and I could not stop going back for more. I definitely followed the freezing step, and it did help give the tofu that more meaty texture. Also, I added in the same kind of spices I would've ordinarily used on chicken -- salt, peper, garlic and onion powder -- before coating w/ egg. That, I think, gave it just the flavor I was looking for and made it a meat substitute my kids continue to ask for. (hubby, who's not vegetarian, rated it OK. It is not a substitute for him.)I only wish prep time (what with the freezing and all)was shorter and not so complex. But i guess that's just working w/ tofu! All in all, great recipe. Thanks for it, we really enjoyed it.

Wow! These are amazing! This was the first time I'd worked with tofu like this and I'm so impressed with the final texture and result after the freezing, frying, and broiling. I didn't bake as some other reviewers mentioned so I'll have to try that method sometime. I have some vegetarian friends who will love me for bringing this dish to dinner!

These were delcious! I did what other reviewers suggested -- froze the tofu overnight, then baked it before starting the recipe. It was much easier to deal with that way, and came out really crispy. Yum -- tasted like buffalo wings! Thanks for a great recipe.

Not one to like the mushy texture of tofu in a recipe which tries to replicate meat, this recipe definitely made the tofu chewy which we liked.  I froze the tofu whole in the package for a few days.  After thawing, I sliced it rather thin.  One block gave me about a dozen slices.  I baked it 20-25 mins. flipping several times until it seemed most of the moisture was out of it.  I also seemed to have a lot of left over flour mixture and would only use 1/2 cup next time.  A little time consuming but will make again.  Might be better named chewy rather than crispy.

Disappointing. Like others, I baked the tofu for 15 minutes first. The breading didn't get crispy at all, and we had to slather it in BBQ sauce to make it palatable. This was quite a lot of work for sub-par results. Thanks anyway.

This recipe was a total hit!  I ended up baking the tofu for 15 minutes @ 350 degrees, smothered in bbq sauce first, then followed the rest of the recipe.  It was really simple and delicious.

Yum! Use the most delicious BBQ sauce you can find. The flavor was amazing, but the strips lost some crispiness in the oven. Next time I will try baking first, then frying as other reviewers suggested.

These were awesome! I followed the advise to bake them first but I don't know how they would turn out without it--probably would be fine.  I did half without baking the last step.  They were both great!

Just made this for dinner. I bought the tofu today so I didn't have time to freeze it so I listened to the other reviewer and tried baking it for 15 mins first and then fried them. They were pretty yummy alone but even better with the extra bbq dipping sauce. I eat it all and now and stuffed.

I see potential in this recipe, but my tofu didn't turn out crisp at all.  It was mushy even after the freezing and frying of it first.  I will have to tweak at it a bit to see if I can't get firmer tofu in the end.

This is a great recipe, but I had a few troubles. Mine still didn't feel like they had much texture to them. I'm going to experiment with much thinner slices and maybe trying some crunchier toppings.

My husband and I liked this recipe very much.   I had a cajun b-b-q sauce on hand which was good but I think next time I will use another sauce flavor as the cajun was a bit overpowering for me.  I feel I will be able to give this recipe a 5-star rating after trying it again w/ another sauce.   Also needed to use an extra egg white.  I hadn't heard about freezing the tofu either.   Wonderful trick.  I am tempted to try the recipe without this step just to see how it compares.  I am definitely going to be using this again and again.

I sliced it using a cheese slicer. I baked it first (as suggested by another reviewer) but did not freeze it. Then battered and fried it using more oil than recommended. I noticed that if I didn't add extra oil, it would take forever to cook and never get golden brown. Then I added Panda Express Orange Chicken Sauce and baked it again. It was a good, filling finger food that the kids liked. Served with crispy seaweed and rice.

Lot of work and my tofu wasn't even crisp on the inside. These looked delicious, but I was very disappointed on the taste. Boring. And did I mention lot of work?

I started with extra firm tofu and followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did differently was some prep with the tofu.  I drained it and placed on a cookie sheet  between multiple sheets of paper towels, then placed a heavy glass pan on top.  This squeezed out more of the water.  I replaced the paper towels often until they weren't soaked anymore (a LOT of paper towels).  Then I froze them overnight.  The next day when they had thawed enough I cut them into strips and prepared them according to the recipe.  What this does is give the tofu more of a texture like meat.  My 10 year old carnivore son loved them, and my super picky 18 year old daughter, who swore she'd never eat tofu, said they were great.  This is my favorite way of preparing and eating tofu.

I made these for my daughter, "the veggie head" and she loved them. I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes after slicing into thick slices beforehand. The rest of the recipe was followed as written except we did not broil the tofu. We cooked them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes after marinating. I tried one and it was pretty good! My daughter said she loved them and described them as "crunchy, but not crunchy". Will make again. :)

I have been a tofu lover almost all my life and never thought to prepare it this way. I didn't completely follow the recipe. I skipped the frozen part and cut the tofu into strips and placed them in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. After placing the tofu in the egg mixture then I mixed them into my flour mixture (a lot of different spices) with panko crumbs, and fried them.  Then I polished them up with barbecue sauce and put under the broiler on low for about 5 minutes. These were absolutely delicious and even the next day.  I  wish I knew how to upload a pic from my Kindle.

This was very good and easy to make.   I pressed the tofu for about 20 minutes vs. freezing.   They turned out great.   I will definitely make these again.

I seared the nuggets in a pan after baking them. It helped, I think. They tasted okay to me but my family thought otherwise. It was a bit bland and didn't taste 'meaty' as expected. Maybe I did something wrong?
On another note, it was very time consuming and messy. Beware!

First time making tofu for the family (told the kids it was chicken) and they loved it!! I will be keeping this recipe for future meals. I did add a little extra seasoning to the flour for flavor. I used garlic salt.

WOW!! Great recipe!! I am not vegetarian nor vegan but would like to incorporate some healthier foods into my diet. I've not had much success with tofu in the past but, this recipe has opened a wide range of opportunities for me.  This was delicious,  and using the process of freezing, baking, frying and broiling made the tofu a texture that can be used for so many tofu recipes with total success. I was surprised at the taste...it was awesome!!! I will be using this often!! Thanks for sharing the recipe and thanks to the reader that shared about baking in their review.

I froze the tofu overnight, thawed, baked for 15 minutes and then proceeded to follow the rest of the directions. This was my first time cooking tofu so I know I did some things wrong, but in the end it turned out quite well and made for a delicious dinner & lunch the next day!

I'm not a vegetarian (my daughters are), and I liked this a lot.  My daughters really liked it.  Like some others, I baked the tofu first, then dipped in egg and dredged in flour before frying it.  I did not broil it afterward, and it was still perfect.  One thing... I should have read a little more carefully about heating the olive oil over *medium* heat, because olive oil has a low smoking point and it can overheat easily.  If you want to cook over a hotter fire to really assure a crispy crust, then use vegetable oil, but if you prefer olive oil take serious note of that medium heat!  Very tasty recipe.

I did not like this recipe at all. Freezing tofu overnight made it very tough and tasteless. I will never mix egg white with tofu again because they just do not go well together. Barbeque sauce totally overpowered everything. I like tofu but this one i could not eat at all.

Omg this stuff was delicious !! I don't see why people disliked it . I pressed the tofu between two plates lines with paper towels to remove water then I baked for about 15-20 min ( freezing and thawing was a little too extra , didn't feel like doing all that..texture came out perfect regardless ) . Because I don't eat eggs I used ground flax seed instead. I added other seasons to the flour mixture such as garlic powder  . I fried then broiled as directed. It was great . Definitely will cook again

Pressing the tofu seems to be better than freezing.  My boyfriend has never been a fan for vegetarian dishes but boy did he enjoy this one. Now we have Tofu Tuesday's every week and this recipe is always in rotation.

Great recipe! In addition to freezing over night, I placed the sliced tofu in the oven for 15 mins prior to frying. I replaced the egg whites with EnerG egg replacer.

Yum!  I cut the tofu into about 1 inch by however long the tofu is rectangles and then froze them.  When it was time to cook, I had to sqeeze out more water but then I baked them.  I spray them with PAM type spray first and that seems to help get them crispy on the outside.  Then after that, I fried them in the oil.  Very good texture, just next time I will try a different sause as my kids didn't like the BBQ flavor.

My 15 yr old son decided on Tuesday that he wants to be vegetarian. I love a challenge so I started looking for tofu recipes and found this one..and I'm glad I did. I followed all the steps but also pressed the water out for a couple of hours and yes, the whole process (press, freeze, thaw, fry, bake) takes a long time.  But I have to say was definitely worth it. Next time, I'll slice thinner and fry a little longer as it could have been crispier for our taste.  My son had it with lettuce and tomato on a bun and he really liked it - hubby and I just had it on its own. We'll definitely have this again.

My kids wanted to try tofu, and this is the recipe they wanted to try.  We followed the recipe as written, except we skipped the freezing step, and instead baked it as another reviewer suggested.  They gobbled it all up.  The recipe is a little time consuming, but I will make it again.

For taste this gets 5 stars.  My kids would have given it more stars if they could.  Everyone loved it!  But I doubt I will make this again, as it was a ton of work to make and clean up after preparing them.

I was sooo hoping this was going to be as good as it looked & it was!! Like other reviewers, I baked the tofu first (after the freeze & thaw step)& proceeded with the recipe exactly &  it turned out amazing!! Chicken wings are the only thing I miss after having to quit eating meat for health reasons.  This hits the spot, thanks.

Absolutely delicious! I am new to cooking and especially new to Tofu, so I was disappointed the few times I made tofu before this recipe and it came out soggy and flavorless. Even my boyfriend, who is not a fan of healthy food, let alone tofu, loved this!

My boyfriend has recently jumped on the vegetarian ban-wagon along side me (7yrs) so I have been trying new recipes and this recipe is actually really good.  I used the trader joe's brand bbq sauce and used 21 season salute along with whole wheat flour and it tasted awesome.  I recommend baking the tofu prior to get the chicken texture.  He told me it really did taste like bbq chicken.  Easy and very pleased with the end result!

Great Recipe! Generally I find that tofu shrinks when fried, but when i baked it first (as per the 1st reviewers suggestion) this didn't happen. Next time I would cut the peices smaller initially. I made half of mine with rib sauce and the other half with honey garlic - both were great! the texture reminded me alot of chicken wings. Great for my vegetarian dinner night! thanks!

This was really good! I will not make it on the stove top again though - I had to babysit the tofu slices as I was scared they would burn - but i wanted to keep them in the pan long enough for them to get crispy. - Next time I will put them in the oven and then broil them.

Maply syrup and soya sauce (mixed together) instead of BBQ sauce makes this recipe delicious! though it wasnt crispy enough gonna try to bake first then fry! serve with sticky rice or sushi rice and wild rocket makes a great dinner!

This was my first recipe using tofu, and I have never been a tofu eater.  I followed the recipe fairly closely making sure to brown the chunks nicely in the frying pan.  It turned out better than I had expected.  The texture was that of chikcen.  An excellent alternative to chicken wings.

We LOVED this recipe! My boyfriend was a little hesitant, but I insisted we make it. We didn't freeze the tofu first(no time), but it turned out wonderful anyway. while we were slicing the tofu, some of it crumbled into little "nuggets" and we cooked these up too with the rest. They were my favorite part! Might make this recipe with chunks in the future. We didn't need any more bbq for dipping because it was perfect as it was. 

Cooked mainly as written aside from using entire egg, and adding 1/2 tsp seasoning salt to the flour instead of table salt.

Good appetizer/snack type deal. The recipe is not well written and therefore confusing to the novice like myself. I did figure it out but it was a little frustrating as that was my first deep fry experience.

This wasn't crispy at all...you'll need to play with how thin you cut the tofu.  I thought it was weird freezing the tofu and it was so messy to work with.  My strips came out more like chicken fingers and the tofu had the texture of a processed chicken patty.  Eh, not pleased.
