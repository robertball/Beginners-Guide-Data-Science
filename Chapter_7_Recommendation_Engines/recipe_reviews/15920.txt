This kugel was delicious.  But after searching 4 stores for the matzo farfel, I finally found it, only to realize that it's really just crushed matzo that I could have made myself by crushing Matzo I could have purchased at the first store.  Very easy to make (with a food processor to shred the apples) and smells declicious when baking.

This was good but too sweet for me.  I tripled the recipe for a large seder I attended.  It fit nicely in a 13x9 baking dish and I was able to make it the night before. We put it in the oven covered with foil at 250 while the seder was going on and took it out after about 45 min.  It was still moist and great.  It was served on the buffet with everything else instead of as a dessert.  I think that was my first mistake.  It was really good and the consistency was great, but I felt the sugar overpowered it.  It actually had a sugar taste.  There is a difference between something tasting sweet and something having a "sugar" taste.  It did not go well with all the other food on the table.  With apple and cinnamon you cannot go wrong, so I am not sure that I would go as low as half the sugar, but for tripling the recipe I would use just over a cup.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra apple. I also opted to use Granny Smith apples.  I cannot wait to make this again, just with lower sugar.

Doesn't taste like a Passover recipe. Good enough to make all year round. Make for parents and requested another batch. Made it in a round cake pan and cut in wedges. Also made in muffin tins. Freezes very well.

Very good and easy recipe.  My family and friends are not big kugel eaters but we really enjoyed this.  I doubled the recipe to make it in a 9 x 13 pan and it worked fine.  The next time I made it, I cut down the sugar, added ground up almonds, raisins and dried cranberries.  By the way -- you don't even need to peel the apples!  I just put them in the processor (cored) but peel and all -- it worked fine.

This was wonderful!  The smell when it was baking, filled my entire house with cinnamon.  It's so easy to make (if you have a food processor), and it was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 pan for the same amount of time and it turned out fine.  I wouldn't wait until Passover to make this dish again.

I didn't care for the texture.  With the shredding of the apples and beating of the egg whites, I thought it was a lot of work.  I took it to a seder and everyone thought it was average.

Very tasty recipe. Probably would be good as a dessert served warm with ice cream.

Pretty good - it disappeared in a flash.  I made mine ahead of time and it deflated somewhat while it cooled, but I don't think anything was lost in flavour.  I'm going to try adding another apple next time to make its taste stand out a little more.

I made this today for our Seder.  Everyone loved it.  It did take more than 15 minutes to make, though - -  maybe because I had to whip the egg whites by hand - -  but it was fabulous.  I will definitely serve this again next year.

How nice to find a lower calorie tasty recipe for Passover. My guests loved this, and I was happy I had set aside some of it for my husband and I - there were NO LEFTOVERS. My husband said: "Good for Passover", but I think it rates: "Good any time of year!". Very easy in the cuisinart.

I thought this was average. I had never made farfel kugel before but heard it was very good. I didn't think so. It was too sweet and I didn't like the texture but to be fair, a couple of members of my family did. I don't think I will be making this again.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  I am making it in a large quantity for my church Seder dinner, so I tried it out ahead of time.    I am sure it will be a hit there also. Thanks for a great recipe.

This apple farfel kugel was a huge hit! It was a nice sweet treat at the seder. The only problem is that it can be a hassle to shred all the apples (I don't have a food processor). But it is worth the effort!

This is a really great recipe for many reasons.  It is quick, it is low in fat, and it is sweet.  This kugel recipe is going to be a staple at our Passovers to come!

This was very tasty. It smelled delicious with the apples and cinnamon and I couldn't wait to dig in. My dinner guests loved it too. A great side dish for Passover.

Excellent! I made this to take to a friend's passover dinner and everyone raved. The sweetness also makes it a hit with children. I will be making it again this holiday season for Christmas dinner.

My family and guests loved it!  I used whole wheat matzoh farfel and even my picky mother-in-law did not mind.  I should have made a double recipe as we gobbled it up.  I made it a second time the next day.  And one of my guests does not like cinnamon, so I baked her a ramekin sized one before adding the cinnamon.  She loved it too.

This was very tasty and very easy to make, but I've never had farfel kugel before, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I would have liked it to be a little drier. It reminded me of a more textured applesauce. It was very sweet. If I made it again I would use more matzo farfel and less sugar.

I decided to try this recipe before I make Passover dinner.  I was very disappointed.  I am going to try it again only this time I will increase the amount of Farfel.
