For what this is--a quick, easy, no-chopping meatball recipe--I thought it was very good.  I was looking for a simple recipe to use in teaching my kids how to cook and this fit the bill, since there was no chopping of veggies, and it was easy for them to mix.  This is a recipe that we have used several times now.  I do find it a little heavy on salt as written, and I'm usually not one to say that.  I have cut the salt back by a third; using 1 teaspoon, as opposed to 1 1/2.  I've improvised by using ground red pepper when I was out of pepper flakes, and it was still great.  I've also improvised with equal amounts of instant stuffing mix when out of bread crumbs, with good results.  I generally use ground turkey with this, just because that's what we always have on hand.  Make sure to look for the video that the author made, which shows this recipe being made!

I have to agree with RENEEHOWARD about these meatballs being too salty. She cut the salt by 1/3rd but I'll go even farther the next time I make this recipe and cut the salt by 2/3rds. Other than that it's a good recipe.

We did a little taste test between these meat balls and another recipe on this site.  These won hands down.  I do have to say that I did not use ground veal but subbed ground pork for the veal.  Very tender and tasty balls.  Thanks!

This recipe was so easy! I watched the video at work on Monday and decided this is what we were having for dinner.  They were so easy to prepare my 6 year old prepared the bread crumbs and egg mixture! It was very flavorful and took less than 15 minutes to prepare everything.  Before I knew it, I was pulling out the meatballs from the oven.  Delicious! Thanks Chef John!

This was really excellent.  I used some oregeno and basil with the parsley and also they didn't have ground veal at the store so I used grond pork.  I made for my wife and I and even just using 1/2 pound of each I had way too many meatballs (over 30 ping pong ball sized) and had to save some of the meat for another time so you really don't need a lot just for one meal.  Broiling went very fast and they didn't dry out.

It was decent. It was quick. And got the job done. I wish it was a bit less tough, but its no big deal. Maybe if I did it again I'd add some sort of vegetable slurry to it. Maybe add more bread crumbs.

I did not have veal on hand, so I subbed 3 italian sausages (removed from casings) and omitted the italian seasoning.  These are now my "go-to" meatball recipe.  I broil these just a few minutes to get those nice charred peaks, then let them flavor my marinara sauce.  I usually go a full half cup on the Parm-Regg.  I love the fact that I don't shape them.

Used herbes de Provence for "Italian seasoning", and all veal rather than beef/veal mix. Cut the salt a little and used 1/4 tsp each black & white pepper. Also, made slightly larger and got about thirty to a batch instead of 48 tiny ones. These are fabulous and quick! Made a double batch and now  I have a bag of much tastier frozen meatballs handy for "no time to cook" dinners. Thanks, Chef John!

I won't go back to making meatballs the old way.  Period.  These are so tasty, the perfect consistency thanks to the veal and fast.  I doubled the recipe, using equal parts ground chuck, pork and veal.  I made larger meatballs and got about 72 meatballs using a 1 1/2 cookie scoop.  Please, please, please try these with the Roasted Tomato Sauce also from Chef John.  You will not be disappointed. Take my advice and double both recipes and stash the extra servings in the freezer for one of those nights when you don't have time or energy to cook.  It's cheaper than take-out!

Made with veal and ground sirloin.   Used a brown sauce  due to stomach issues with tomato sauce.  

A little bland and because I used sirloin a bit dry.   But it was a fast and easy recipe as promised.

As a busy mom, I am always looking for a simple, quick way to make a delicious meal. If it involves too many steps, I’ll often skip it. For example... what’s easier: browning ground beef in a pan and adding marinara or making meatballs? But this recipe is simple and delicious enough for me to add to our dinner line-up. I have made this recipe several times as meatballs, using all ground beef or half beef and half Italian sausage. I don’t find it too salty at all. I typically use one teaspoon of salt per pound of meat as a rule. And actually, this recipe ends up as meatloaf more often than not and everyone in the family loves it! Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!

I've made this a few times now, and each time it's turned out very well. Never made meatballs before, and they never tasted better. Thank you Chef John!

Awesome meatballs. I made it without veal and just used half as much ingredients as called for. Tasted great, only problem I had was while they were cooking every once in a while a puff of fire came up. Still awesome recipie

Regarding the saltiness - I added garlic salt (instead of garlic powder) plus a little more garlic power and they were perfect. No more salt was needed.  I used a melon baller (large size - about 1-1 1/2 " in size) and the recipe made between 40-45 meatballs.  I put them on a cookie sheet on parchment and froze the ones I didn't cook with the sauce.  Great recipe.

Pretty good meatball. I used pork instead of veal and it turned out good. Definitely liked the slurry idea over blending all at once. Kept the meatball more loose. 

Definitely make again worthy.

Super Yummy.   Would be better with marrinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.

This a solid base recipe and easy to make.  Great for kids to help with in the kitchen since there is no chopping.  Chef John has lots of great recipes.  I also like his tomato sauce.

I tried them once and my 2 year old and son loved them. My son said they were better than his nannies. I don't use salt and I use minced garlic.

This recipe is just what I've been looking for! Quick and delicious!! My Mom makes the worlds best meatballs and no matter how many times I've tried, I can't duplicate them!  This actually comes close!  I'm not sure of this makes the difference, but I've not made a "slurry" and then mixed in the seasoned meat in the past.  I do now!!
