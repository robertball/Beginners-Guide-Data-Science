I have made this for the passed 25 years! My family expects it every holiday. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and serve as a side dish. The hardest thing is finding canned apples that are not pie filling. Lucky brand makes them so I stock up when I see them.

Absolutely delicious! I use 2 cans of sliced apples. I used a 1 1/2 quart baking dish.

This was spectacular! I made my own Apple filling using figi apples sugar cinnamon and a little cayenne which I thought would add some zing(it did)! This was so good I have family requests to make it again and NOT to make it again because of how much of this was eaten! It's that good!
