I’m not a real big “fancy cocktail” person, but this one worked for me.  The lemon lime soda seemed to mellow out the cranberry juice just enough and then the deep flavor of the bourbon kicked in.  Very nice!

Adding a lime to it really helped to balance out the flavor even more! Overall really good!
