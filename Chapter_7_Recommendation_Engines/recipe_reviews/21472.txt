I tried this bread. I am looking for a good bread to use to make homemade french toast. I didn't add the raisins this time. The dough was almost soupy when I went to put it in the fridge. I left it in my mixer bowl because of that. To my surprise, it did rise a little by morning. I had to add 2-1/2 to 3 cups of flour to it to get it to a rolling or patting consistancy. My Kitchen Aid worked great for this! I can't imagine using a hand mixer. I also substituted powdered buttermilk for the liquid buttermilk. As someone else said, it does make a lot of dough so I made two breads out of it. The sugar/cinnamon topping is enough for 2 breads. I let it rise again after it went into the pans for an hour in a warm oven as an experiement to see if it would rise at all again. Well, it rose beautifully! I was afraid all that mixing in of the extra flour would have killed the yeast. I'm glad it didn't. Now to bake it. It baked for 25 minutes and looked nice. I let them cool and I sliced them. They tasted great! They sliced nice, had good consistancy. Good I think for french toast. I was a little disapointed that there didn't seem to be more cinnamon flavor. I may increase the cinnamon another 1-2 tsp. I upped the amount I put in to 1 tbsp. I think it needs more. Also, maybe adding more topping to the dough may help as well. Overall, I'm very pleased with this recipe. It takes a while, but the results are worth it. I WILL make this again!!!

This is the first time I have made a yeast bread which came out so soft! The batter for the first half of the recipe remained pretty soft and could not be rolled into a ball. I just covered it up with some plastic wrap in the bowl and it rose perfectly! I did not measure how much more flour I added into the risen dough but I left my dough pretty soft still. I rolled out the dough on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and proceeded with the recipe using cinnamon sugar instead of plain cinnamon. Unfortunately because I left the dough so soft, it started t spread out on the cookie sheet so I just lifted the parchment paper into a bread pan and let it bake as the recipe stated. I rubbed some butter over the top when it finished baking and it soaked in giving it a nice buttery-cinnamon taste through the whole bread! It keeps well in the fridge when wrapped in plastic wrap. All I do is lightly toast a slice and it is perfect! Great breakfast bread!

The bread is great.  Caveat: The recipe makes too much for one loaf. Impossible to get it to bake all the way through. Divided the dough into two loafs, and they came out a good size -- still quite large. Baked for about 60 mins -- 35 is nowhere near enough.

I have yet to taste the finished bread, but the dough tastes wonderful! :o)
My dough was way too 'soft'- it wasn't even really dough!- so I had to use extra flour. I wanted it somewhat wholesome, so I used 3 1/2 cups unbleached flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. Then I had to add another 1 1/2 cups for it to actually be kneadable. I only used one package of yeast, and 1/2 cup raisins. I mixed 1/4 cup into the dough and then spread the remaining 1/4 cup on before rolling. 

I like that this recipe can be prepared the night before and then just pressed out, rolled up, and baked in the morning- fits my lifestyle very well!!

This bread has an awesome tastes and is very soft textured, like that of bread you get in a store.  I had to modify if a bit, I only used 2 1/4 tsps of yeast( 1 packet) and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white, also to the dough I add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and added my raisins. In the morning I rolled this out to make 2 loaves instead of one.  I felt this recipe made a lot of dough. I had to bake mine at 400 for about 55 minutes.  I will make this again but continue to try to improve it... overall pretty good.  I liked using buttermilk.  Thanks

This is pretty good bread, but it makes way more than 1 loaf of bread . . .unless you have huge bread pans.  I was able to get 6 huge cinnamon rolls and two medium sized loaves out of one batch.  I think I'd halve it next time; it just makes way too much!  I didn't use the overnight rise method because I had time to make it in its entirety yesterday, so that's what I did.  I definitely had to add more flour; I think it was about 2 cups when all was said and done, so the ratio of liquid to dry ingredients is off.  However, when making bread it's also dependent on the humidity at the time you make it, so the ratio is not always accurate from day to day.  This is a light, mild white bread that works well as a dessert loaf.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this tasted pretty good, but boy the dough was hard to work with as it was so sticky. I had some cinnamon bread in TN once and was always wanting to find a recipe that replicated it, and happen to be recommended this on the recipe buzz. The bread tasted like cinnamon swirl bread but had the texture of monkey bread or a cinnamon roll. This is pretty close. I followed the recipe except I used mock buttermilk and 1/2 the raisins suggested. After refridgerating I ended up adding near 3/4 of a cup more flour during the quick kneading process just to make it more manageble. I shaped it into a 12x15 rectangle to add the sugar, cinnamon, and raisins as it didn't specify. I also had to heavy flour my hands to roll it and had to quickly transfer it to a bread pan. I just used a regular bread pan. It seemed like more than one loaf but not quite enough for two. I put the bread pan on a sheet pan and was glad I did because I got a little spillage in the first 10 minutes. If you are looking for perfectly swirled cinnamon bread that slices perfectly for the toaster this bread is not for you. But, if you want super soft cinnamon roll like bread you can almost tear pieces off and eat you will love it!

After reading through the various comments, I thought this would be a good bread to try to make a cinnamon apple bread (I hate raisins).  I decided to make the whole batch, and split it in half with one loaf being "plain" and the other being cinnamon apple.    Pros:  The flavoring is great for a sweet bread.  We actually even used the cinnamon apple bread for french toast one day and it was amazing!  I also liked that it rose overnight, which made the overall process easy since I was short on time the day I made the dough.  Cons:  The recipe as written comes out more liquid than dough.  I increased my flour and my cooktime, but I still didn't get it quite right for the first loaf.  Definitely 45-60 mins!!  Also, I wouldn't make it plain.  It was way too sweet to eat without something in it to kick it up a notch.  Overall, I'll make this again when I want a special sweet bread just because it rises overnight which makes the overall process pretty easy when you are short on time.

I followed the recipe exactly and have to say it tastes very good. The dough, however, was extremely goopy (toooo much liquid in the recipe) so I'll have to tweak it like the other reviewers did until it can be made into a nice loaf.  Better yet, this recipe is good enough for cinnamon rolls so I'll have to play with it to get the dough just right.

I made this bread twice. The first time I put it in a large loaf pan and after almost two hours baking, it was still raw on the inside. 
The second time I made a braid and put it on a baking sheet, it was still much too soft on the inside, and the crust was too hard. 
This is not a bread and not a sweet dough, something in between that doesn't work. The dough is much too soft, and there is too much leavening.

It was my first time making bread and cooking with yeast. It did not give clear instructions of how to roll the dough out so, when  I baked it the inside wasn't baked all the way thru. It got a little flatter in the oven.

I made this bread, but I was glad I read the comments first. I looked at the recipe- FIVE cups of flour? Another bread recipe I'd used said 2.5-3 cups for 1 loaf. SO, I used 4 cups white flour and 2 cups whole wheat= 6 cups instead of 5. I also added 1/3cup raisins and kneaded them in a bit. I didn't have buttermilk, and the store was closed, so I added 1/2 cup hot water (I heated in microwave) to 1.5 cups yogurt to dilute it to buttermilk consistency. I did the overnight rise, but took it out at 10:30, went to church, ate lunch and let it warm up on the counter. It did rise a little more, but I knew it wouldn't rise as much using the whole wheat. About 1:30, I divided the dough into halves, brushed with butter, used the cinnamon but with brown sugar, 2/3 cup more raisons, and added 2 ounces of walnuts. I rolled up each piece, and put in bread pans, and baked for 45-50 minutes. WOW did it come out well! Hubby loved it and my cat even begged some! The extra flour at the beginning meant that minimal kneading was needed. It looked more like bread and came out kind of wonderfully yummy this way.

I subbed 2 cups rice milk with 2 tbs vinegar (let it set at least 5 min.) and it turned out great!!
