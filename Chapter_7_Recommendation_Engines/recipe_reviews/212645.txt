I couldn't find the Campbells condense gumbo soup  instead I sub regular gumbo soup by another brand. The flavor was a little weak, it was missing that "kick". However, I still got a thumbs up from my family (Louisiana natives). Will try again =0)

Easy and delicious! I used the light version of Campbell's condensed gumbo. I don't like hot spice; so, I substituted Creole seasoning for the Cajun seasoning. I used brown rice instead of white rice. My oven tends to cook on the slow side. I needed to cook this for 45 minutes for the liquid to properly absorb. This dish was very flavorful.  This one's a keeper!

This was okay, but could not find the canned soup, and the whole thing seemed to be missing something more flavorful.

OK, I might try making it with regular rice, the instant rice just gave it an unpleasant texture.

I gave this 4 stars with changes.  I live in Louisiana....So, these are the changes I made: I doubled the recipe, instead of dried onions, I used 1 whole chopped onion.  i could not find campbells, so I used 3 cans of progresso, added gumbo filet, old bay seasoning, black pepper and Tony Chachere to taste, and I cooked it on top of the stove, stirring constantly on medium to medium high heat, adding the shrimp when all the rice was cooked.....and let sit for about 5 mins when done.  Great starter recipe, tho

This went over like gangbusters in my house. While it's not real gumbo, it's definitely a good weeknight substitute. It was quick to throw together and very tasty. It reheated very well for lunches that week. I've also been asked to tell you to add a couple dashes of Frank's Red Hot to your bowl :)

We LOVE this recipe.  I have made it twice now and my picky eater of a son always has 2 bowls. Of course I have made a few changes, we don't like okra so I don't use that and I use 1 pound of shrimp and half pound of scallops. I don't even weigh how much ham I put in! I maybe do 75% of a can of water, that way it's not to soupy. Also fresh onions.

I used fresh ognions and fresh garlic which I stir fried before adding the other ingredients. I also added black pepper, extra okra and kidney beans. It came out delicious!! Oh and I added shrimp.
