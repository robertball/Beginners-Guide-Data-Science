I have been searching for years for this recipe.  This slaw is served at a local BBQ restaurant and it is so good.  It does have quite alot of "heat" spice-wise to it so decrease hot sauce if you would like. I served it for 35 people and had alot of requests for the recipe.  One recipe fed this many people.

Very Good! When I saw lettuce and ketchup in the list of ingredients I was skeptical but had to try it.  I'm so glad I did.  This was delicious!

This sounded so good, I was so excited to make this for one daughter who is vegan, and the other who is gluten-free, but it was a disappointment.  It just tasted like a spicy ketchup sauce....UNTIL...the next day my husband added some mayonnaise (no longer vegan or gluten free now) but it became ADDICTING!  Spicy dressing was more like French dressing now.  When I make this again I will reduce the ketchup to half what is called for.  I had also substituted Agave Nectar for the white sugar.
