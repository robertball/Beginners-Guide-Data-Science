I've been visiting this website for a long time, but this is my first review.  Just had to tell you,found this in the "Daily Recipes" section, took it home and made if for dinner last night.  My husband, a former chef, mumbled thru his second bite, "Keeper".  High praise indeed!  I took advice from earlier reviewers, marinated the chicken in worchester sauce, lime juice and garlic (NOT and optional ingredient in our house), left out the light corn syrup (never use it) and used a good stone ground mustand.  Found the "zing" some of the others were looking for.  I think the corn syrup is just too much sweet with the honey to stand up to the mustard.  Served it over thin spinich noodles, there was no leftover sauce.  This is on the menu the next time we entertain.  Thanks!!!

This is the best recipe that I have made from this site yet.  DO NOT USE CORN SYRUP and try to avoid using regular mustard but use dijon. I thought about just buying an already prepared sauce but realized people were raving about it.  DON'T CHEAT YOUR TASTEBUDS. Make the sauce..it takes 5 minutes. Avoid use of a ton of pans.  I fried the bacon, drained some of the grease, sauted mushrooms in bacon grease, then sauted chicken (seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion powder ) in that grease which added extra flavor to the chicken.  Pound the breasts (they will cook faster and the bac/mush won't fall off) and make sure they are brown to avoid having to bake longer. This recipe says to bake 15 mins but I took others advice and did 30 to make certain my chicken was cooked all the way. It's safer that way especially if your meat is thick (tastier w/ thin breasts). I think you only need about 1 cup of cheese. Two cups is a bit much (whole bag) for 4 breasts.  I made six breasts and I didn't use all my cheese. To avoid cheese from buring you could just add it 15 minutes before taking it out the oven. I baked mine with the cheese on and covered for 15 minutes then added more cheese,uncovered and baked another 15 or so till I knew the meat was done. My picky son rated this a 10. If you are serving guests know their tastes before trying this one but if they like bacon, mush, cheese...go for it!!!!

Okay, 5 stars for taste, and 5 stars because we are still alive after eating this "heart attack on a plate" chicken!  It WAS delicious though!! My husband raved, and it takes alot for him to rave about something! I halved the recipe, only used a splash of corn syrup though, and didn't have onion flakes so I threw in a dash of onion powder.  Also, to me it seems silly to dirty a bunch of skillets when everything is going in one place?  So first I sauteed the mushrooms in a large skillet (come on, you have to saute the mushrooms! DONT put them on the chicken raw!) then when they were done, removed with a slotted spoon and fried the bacon.  Then removed the bacon and sauteed the chicken breasts in the bacon drippings instead of using additional veg. oil.  Voila - only one dirty pan! Oh, I also marinated my chicken beforehand in worchestshire instead of seasoning salt. The halved recipe fit perfectly in an 8x8 pan, still baked for 15 min.  Even though this is fattening, it definitely could be a company dish because it serves very nicely, just make sure you know your company's palates before making it.  Also, you could sub. a jar of already made honey mustard sauce instead of making your own to save some time.

This was beyond excellent!  I didn't think it sounded too good, but since I had all the ingredients on hand, I took my chances and my husband is still raving about this dish!  I marinated the chicken first all day in equal parts worcestershire and Wish Bone Italian dressing with a chopped clove of garlic, then followed the recipe and it was tender and flavorful.  I also browned the chicken in the bacon drippings instead of oil. I also used two extra slices of bacon and used cheddar cheese instead of the cheese called for in the recipe.  I was surprised at how nicely the flavors blended in this dish!

While I thought that this recipe tasted wonderful, I thought that the 'Alice Chicken' recipe I found on this sight was basically the same, easier to make, and tasted better.

Good, easy and very rich. I omitted the corn syrup and sprinkled the chicken w/season salt before browning. Next time I would half the sauce ingredients.I love cheese but I would only use 1 cup 2 was just too much.

Everyone loves this recipe when I make it. The only change I made was that I sautee the mushrooms in olive oil, parsley, and minced garlic before topping the chicken with them.

Great dish. Easy to do also. I grilled my chicken breast till browned, used honey mustard instead of making it. After I took out the bacon I stir-fried the mushrooms(2 cups). Dumped that over breasts and topped with jalapeno jack cheese. Served diced avacado on top with a fresh rosemary sprig in the garlic potates.Whoa baby!!!

I used Turkey bacon for a more crisp taste. The chicken was very tender and moist, then you have the turkey bacon which is very tasty and crisp. The combination is amazing.

Yum!!!  :)
I made this the first time as written, and after later attempts to make this at least a little healthier, I agree with other reviewers that this is just as delicious using half the cheese and bacon.  I also like to double the mushrooms and throw in some baby spinach.  (To be fair, if you are trying to replicate what you'd get in the restaurant, the original recipe is more accurate.)
The honey mustard alone is worth 5 stars with a couple of tweaks:  skip the corn syrup, use half yellow and half spicy brown or dijon mustard, onion powder instead of flakes (more pleasant texture, and no onion bits sinking to the bottom).  I definitely don't *buy* honey mustard anymore!
Thanks Beckie!!!    :)

this is the alice springs chicken from outback steak house, I worked there for years I can tell you there is no cornstarch or onions of any kind in the entire recipe. And saute your mushrooms in a mixture of onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and paprika.

I am in love with this sauce..How delicious. As I ALWAYS do with any chicken I make-I let it soak in buttermilk all day(1cup milk 1tbs white vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk on hand)-makes the chicken sooo moist.  Wiped off the milk and sprinkled with the seasoned salt and fried for 4 minutes on each side.  I would def do 5 minutes because I did have to cook in the oven for 20-25 minutes as it was still a little pink after 15 minutes.   I used 1/2 dijon 1/2 yellow mustard for the mustard part(for those that don't know what prepared mustard is- it is any mustard in a jar or container)I also coated the chicken in the sauce after browning and poured over the top before adding the mushroom, bacon, and cheese.  Didn't reserve any.   Next time I will cover the dish with tinfoil and cook for 15 minutes then remove tinfoil and let the cheese melt..that only takes a minute.  Great share-THANKS!

This is similar to the Alice Chicken recipe I found on this website. I made this one to compare them and my family agreed that the other one was much better. Maybe because the chicken breasts are marinated in Worcestershire sauce?  Baked in oven instead of fried.  I used Marie's Honey Mustard salad dressing on the side.

Loved the combination of flavors and the sauce. My husband really doesn't like chicken breasts and said he would eat this anytime because it was delicious. Don't be turned off by the few bad reviews -- this is delicious if done correctly so just follow the recipe and don't change anything. We loved this and will go to bed dreaming about the yummy flavor. Went great with BV Napa Zinfindal.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, Rebecca!  This one is a winner for sure.
I am not a big fan of mustard, I used Dijon, the spice from the mustard, and the sweetness of the honey made an out of this world sauce.  Here are the changes I made:  As others had mentioned, I browned the chicken in the same skillet that I cooked the bacon in.  Also, I prepared the dish in the morning, (skipped the seasoning salt on the chicken)  instead I prepared the dish put all the sauce on the chicken, and put the entire thing in the  refrigerator, and let it set until dinner.  Then I pulled it out of the refer, put it in the oven, and baked it for about 30 minutes. 
TRY THIS RECIPE, you will not be sorry.

Just made this tonight and it was delicious!  We did make some changes based on others' reviews.  We used 1/4 cup of dijon and a 1/4 cup yellow mustand.  We also used onion powder insteard of flakes just for the sake of texture.  Otherwise, followed it as written.  Definitely will make again but not often since it is not very healthy!  But worth making.  We also added some green onions on top for garnish which was really good.  Thanks.

A super recipe.  I rate ***** for taste.  1 * for nutrition, (IF you need to reduce sodium level). (AllRecipies evaluation of 1714 mg sodium is a LOT per serving!).  I am not talking about the recipe "as changed", but "as written".

Love, love, love this recipe! It's as close to the restaurant version as it can be! I cook the bacon, then use the same pan (with the bacon grease) to cook the chicken and then use that same pan to saute the mushrooms. Adds tons of flavor!

Excellent recipe.  The first time I made it, I used the bacon strips.  It was difficult to eat with them sliding everywhere, so I've decided to use bacon bits the next time.  The other thing--I tasted too much of the mayo.  I'm gonna ease up on that. Thanks for the recipe!

This was by far one of the best recipes I've tried!! Our neibor's came for dinner and they don't like mushrooms, but they both asked for seconds and the recipe! I reccomend cooking the baking in a pan, removing it and then cooking the mushrooms in the bacon grease.  It sounds fattening but if you use turkey bacon it cuts out a lot of fat but adds lots of flavor!!!

This is one dish I make approx. twice a month. I wouldn't change much, but OMIT the corn syrup, it's way too sweet. Once you try this awesome dish, you will adapt (mayo/mustard) ratios to your tastebuds.I use Dijon Mustard. p.s. pat bacon dry,it does get greasy with the cheese!

Great recipe! I alter it sometimes to be a bit healthier-  turkey backon, fat free mayo and cheese. I've yet to make this for someone that doesn't love it! Thank you for this recipe!

Wow! Just finished eating it. Hubby loved it. We are eating clean so omitted mayo. But it didnt take anything away from it. Instead of veg oil, I used EVOO. Used sauted onions and garlic, added to mushrooms. Its a keeper. Thanks for the recipe. Dawn

Wow, everyone raved.  I doubled the recipe, but would suggest that you not make the recommended quantity of honey mustard sauce as it was clearly too much.  The recipe was delicious.  I did cook it ten minutes longer than recommended and delayed topping the chicken with the mushroom, bacon and honey mustard until after the breasts cooked ten minutes in the oven.

Very yummy! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I also browned the chicken breasts in the bacon fat and sauted the mushrooms in it too. I prepared it the day before, and just didn't put the cheese on until after baking it for 15 minutes the next day. Then I popped it in the oven for another 10 minutes. Very nice flavour!

I don't know what more I could say about this recipe. It was MAGNIFICENT!!!! I don't use salt in my cooking (cheese and bacon add enough) so I just sprinkled onion and garlic powder over the chicken. I drained most of the bacon fat out of the skillet and then sauteed the chicken in what was left (about a tablespoon). Once the chicken was out I threw in the mushrooms for about five minutes. I didn't reserve any of the sauce, but used all of it in the casserole and topped with pepper jack cheese for a little zip. Thanks so much for an absolutely wonderful dish; my hubby and kiddies loved it!!!!

Oh my word... SOOO good, the Calories are crazy, but if you haven't eatten that much for the day, you're good to go... I didn't use the Corn Syrup, cause that is way too much sugar, and I baked mine inthe oven for 35 minutes at 375 after browning and adding all the stuff to the top, was great, we had it with Brocolli!!! YUM YUM

With 45 minutes till dinner, I discovered I didn't have enough main dish to serve.  My daughter quickly logged on to Allrecipes and entered the ingredients I had on hand-Chicken, cheese & bacon and Voila!!! Aussie Chicken appeared.  My husband pouunded the meat while I made the sauce.  My daughter diced the bacon and sliced the mushrooms and through them in a pan.  I sprinkled the chicken with seasoning salt, microwaved it until just pink, poured on half the sauce,spread on the mushrooms, bacon and sprinkled with cheese on hand.  Popped it into the oven and twenty minutes later listened to my quests "OOOH and MMMMM" over it.  I heated the left over sauce for anyone with a wicked sweet and sour tooth!!! and served along with rice and green beans.  What a great dish!  Thanks.

As someone who has worked for this particular restaurant for 10 years, I'm telling you if you want it authentic, grill the chicken first with just a salt and pepper blend seasoning, then layer the honey mustard  sautéed seasoned mushrooms, bacon whole then Monterey Jack and CHEDDAR cheese.... at least that's how they make it there :)

I've never had this at the restaurant, so I can't do a comparison. Let me just say this, though: This recipe has knocked the previous "best chicken" recipe back a notch in my book! This was quite easy to prepare, though a tad time consuming for me (I'm a little slow in the kitchen!). the sauce, which marries the bacon and mushrooms to the chicken so well, could well be used on some seafoods and vegetables or even as a salad dressing. I didn't have any problem with it being "fatty" or with the sauce being too dull. Absolutely top cabin chicken - Thanks, beckie!

Wow. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical of the mushrooms, cheese, and honey mustard sauce together, but wow.  I already said that.  It was so easy to make and it didn't take 5 dishes to make it.  That in my opinion is a major plus.  Rebecca thank you for posting.  This is definately a keeper.

My family LOVES this recipe!! When marinating, I usually add some worcestershire sauce. I also BBQ'd the chicken for a little added flavor.  If you don't want to BBQ the chicken, I suggest cooking the chicken breasts in the bacon drippings. It pulls all of the flavors in the recipe together and I have found that the chicken is more tender.  I also grate my own cheese.  I buy large blocks from the grocery store and grate them in the food processor.  The cheese is more moist that way and I find that it melts more smoothly. It might be one more step and may make the recipe a little bit more tedious but I think you will see that it is worth it.  I have made the recipe with mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, new potatoes and homemade french fries. A very good recipe for the whole family and for guests. Enjoy!!

This was a big hit for us.  I made as directed with the one exception of the corn syrup.  I didn't have any, and after reading the reviews, it seemed like it would be plenty sweet without it, and it was.  The homemade honey mustard was DELICIOUS!  Don't cut corners by using premade...it's very quick and easy to make, and was awesome!  Will make again for sure!

So good! Marinated the chicken for a day ahead in italian dressing and worcestershire sauce and it was amazingly moist and juicy! Didn't use the corn syrup and used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 yellow mustard. Great sauce! Used mushrooms that were sauteed with onion. My guests loved it!

If there was a way to give his 4 3/4 stars I would!  This was a great way to make chicken!  We eat a lot of chicken, so I'm always open to new ideas.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to use my own honey mustard for the chicken.  The honey mustard in this recipe is a tad sweet for our liking.  I do think everyone should try the recipe as written first!  Thanks so much for this new way I will be making chicken!

This is always a hit with my husband and kids.  I have tried several variations on this recipe, and this is a very good one.  This honey mustard sauce is definately definately excellent.  It makes all the difference to use this sauce and not a bottled variety.  I highly recommend flattening the chicken, tonight when I made it I was in a hurry and skipped that step but it actually ended up taking me longer due to the extra cooking time needed for the chicken.  I make extra mushrooms for me and my husband, and just leave them off the kids. Kind of a lot of steps, pans and calories, so this is a once in awhile treat for us.  Very good recipe, thank you Rebecca.

Thanks Rebecca.  We loved it! Used cheddar cheese since that was all I had on hand.  Followed directions exactly.  The sauce was so easy to make - had extra - used it the next day on a sandwich made on french bread, a declicate leafy lettuce, thin slices of black forest ham, brie cheese, tomatoes and the sauce - Outrageous!!

20 STARS!!!!!!! This recipe was the best! Just like the chicken at the restaurant. SO EASY and SO GOOD!!!!! I think sliced scallions on top would be even better! I did use bottled honey mustard sauce to save time and ingredients. Absolutely awesome!!    Thanks!   Erin

I thought this recipe was good but nothing to rave about.  It is similar to "Alice Chicken" found on this website only you add mushrooms and make your own "homemade" honey mustard sauce. (in fact, I like the sauce better than any store-bought stuff and will probally use that part of the recipe for other things more than I will use on chicken).  Overall, it is a good and easy recipe and I will probally make again but only when I am bored and have nothing better to make. I don't feel that this one will make my top 10 list.  I appreciate the change of pace just the same.

This recipe tastes EXACTLY like the chicken I like at my favorite resturant, which incidently burned down earlier this year.  Hubby thought I outdid myself on this one! :)  I used pre-sliced mushrooms, pre-shredded cheese, and real bacon bits to save prep time.

Followed review suggestions and didn't use corn syrup and the only mustard I have is spicey deli.  I mixed [uncooked] mushroom slices into the sauce and spooned it onto the chicken n eyeballed the cheese.  Crushed some turkey bacon ontop after it was baked - so freakin good!  Thank you for posting the recipe!

Sorry didn't do it for me.  I wondered why it took so much cheese until I took it out of the oven and realized it was the only thing that was half-way decent.

I know this recipe has alot of excellent reviews, and I did make it exactly the way the recipe specified, except I cut back a bit on the cheese. We could not eat the bacon/cheese topping - it was just too salty. I probably won't make this again. If I am going to splurge on fat and calories it will be for something that tastes better.

Very good! A keeper! I didnt' use any corn syrup and it was still a bit too sweet, will cut down on the honey next time. I used cheddar instead of Monterrey jack. Didn't have onion flakes so made it without. Wasn't sure what's seasoning salt so used a combo of chimichurri (pepper + garlic + olive oil + cilantro + parsley + red pepper flakes + paprika) + salt, it was DELICIOUS! Since no one in my family likes chicken breasts I used 6 drumsticks and baked for 30min on 380F. Didn't like the bacon fat so I used ham slices instead :) I also left out the mushrooms since I needed it for the spaghetti. This is a very good recipe that you can make lots of alternations!

This is a fantastic chicken recipe, left out the bacon and used raspberry honey mustard dip. My boyfriend begs me to make this, says it is the best chicken he has ever had. I will be making this over and over again. I will experiment with different cheeses and sauce. Well worth trying this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

Yum! While I've never had this at Outback, my boyfriend has. He said it's not the same but it's still really good... I enjoyed it too. Served with some rye bread I had made and stored in the freezer (perfect!) and a homemade caesar salad (used Caesar Salad Supreme recipe from here) and we had a nice dinner in. =) I'd recommend using a mild seasoning salt--or even just S&P. I think that made a difference in the flavor... the stuff I used had a stronger that likely impacted this dish overall. Still, no complaints =)

Husband couldn't say enough nice things about-- which means *PLEASE MAKE IT AGAIN!* Although we love mushroom, didn't have any, (and it was too cold to go out for some at last minute!), so used sliced onion, red and green bell pepper sautee to dress up the top. TURNED OUT BEAUTIFUL. Didn't have enough honey, so used PURE MAPLE SYRUP, which is little runnier and less sweet in place of honey and corn syrup-- but boy, did it make INCREDIBLE SAUCE!  Reading other reviews, used half yellow and half dijon mustard, and after searing pounded chicken in the same pan that cooked bacon, then veggies, coated chicken pieces one side using half the sauce, then flipped them, and poured the rest of the sauce on top. Arranged the sautee mix, bacon, and cheese for 15 in the preheated oven, then served with wild rice, spooning the sauce over the rice. Will be making it again and again and again... If you don't TRY THIS RECIPE, you're missing out!

First I just want to say that it is ridiculous to rate a delicious recipe according to it's fat content.  Did you not read the ingredients before you made it? Sorry, it is a no brainer. This was an amazing recipe and I did not change a thing.  I made it for my mother (who loves the dish from the ("popular restaurant chain") and said this was even better.  Thanks so much!

I swear that my husband is the worlds pickiest eater and he really liked this. My three boys raved over it and begged me to make it again. Half of my family dosen't like mushrooms so I left them out (I'd like to make it with them because it would be even better!!!)...over all, one of the BEST recipes ever. Very elegant looking too! The only change I would make is to reduce the seasoning salt by half. I doubled the bacon and cheese to please my hubby. I added all the sauce instead of reserving half and spooned the hot extra sauce on top. WOW!! Thank you so much for this recipe!!! :-)

I figured from all the rave reviews this had to be good.  It really was!  I freaked out at the calorie count, so I cut the sauce by 1/3 to make it not so harsh on the gut.  I also cut the cheese by 1/4.  (I realize I just said cut the cheese!)  Anyway, this was soooo good!  I served this on a bed of rice.  I drizzled the reserve sauce over the rice, sprinkled with some fresh parsley, then placed the chicken in the middle, then placed corn (my veggie last night) around the outer edge of the plate, sprikled with more fresh parsley, and it was awesome!  Thanks to whoever came up with this one!

I made this for some guests.  Everyone, including my 15 year old, loved it!!!  Things that I changed...marinated the chicken in worcheshire sauce, sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon grease (added some garlic).  I also used green onions instead of dried, and put some on the top, too. I omitted the karo syrup as well, tasting it before I added, and it was plenty sweet the way it was.  I also used Maille's horseradish mustard.  Excellent!  I served this with Garlic Mashed potatoes secret recipe and Great Garlic bread, both from this site.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good recipe without too much work.  I liked the different flavor as I'm always out to find a new way to serve chicken.  I grilled the breasts instead and used chopped green onion in place of the minced, dried onion.  I also added some mushrooms to the topping and enjoye the added flavor.  My husband enjoyed it and I'm serving it again for guests tonight!

This was a great dish! I've never really liked chicken breasts. After this recipe, I really enjoyed it. I followed a few suggestions (sautee mushrooms in bacon drippings and cut out oil). For the most part, I followed the recipe to a 't' for the sauce, however, I suggest tasting the sauce as you mix ingredients so that you end up with a sauce suited for your tastes.

This was a really good dish.  I followed other's suggestions and marinated the chicken in worchestire sauce, finely minced garlic, lemon juice and lawrys salt.  I sauteed the chicken in the bacon drippings and added the leftover marinating sauce in the pan as well and then sauteed the mushrooms in the drippings/sauce. For the sauce, I left out the corn syrup and used onion salt. I didn't halve the sauce since I had 8 chicken breast and it was just enough.  I also didn't reserve any sauce, I just poured it all over the chicken and ovened it.  It turned out perfect served with spinach linguine.

I am only 12 and I could cook this! It was great. My whole family loved it. My brother didn't like it that much, but that is okay because he is a picky eater anyway. I wouldn't change a single bit of the recipe. It was fine just how it was.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! It was so good that it left my wife and I literally licking our plates. So, I made a couple modifications. First, I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, cayenne pepper, and seasoning salt and then covered and refrigerated for 3 hours. Next modification was that I substituted the corn syrup with a sugar & H20 mixture. I also substituted pepperjack cheese for the monterey. I omitted the mushrooms because they are not a personal preference. GREAT JOB & THANKS Beckie for the submission.

So unhealthy but so worth it! A few bites in, the family demanded that was on the "make again" list. We do not like mushrooms so I sauted some onions in their place. Did not use corn syrup and used half spicy brown mustard, half yellow. No need to add extra oil if you cook the bacon, save some of the grease and then cook the remaining ingredients  in the bacon grease.

I actually made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as written and found that the composition of the recipe lacked standard, although there are many such recipes in use. The next time I experimentd with the sauce. I still ket the same quantity of mustard by using one tablespoon of dry English mustard and three egg yolks along with one sweetener, Maple Syrup and blended them well, eliminating the Mayo. I grated my onions fine and used Prague cooked ham and eliminated the greasey bacon content. Worked well!

I have to say this is one of the best chicken recipes I've had in a long time. Loved loved loved it. It was so good, that my pickie 8 and 3 yr old eat everything on their plate. That doesn't happen very often... I followed just about everything, but I only put a splash of corn syrup and you can never have enough cheese. So put as much as you like. Other then that, this will have you making it a monthly thing, if not weekly.

haven't tried the chicken yet, but i have made the mustard sauce and it is sooo good. i left out the corn syrup because for me, it's sweet enough with the honey. i've used it on sandwiches, chicken cordon bleu, and chicken tenders. even my 3 yr old likes it! 5 stars for the sauce!!!!

We have made this several times. I have never used corn syrup though...think it is sweet enough with honey. I also don't rub with salt, again the bacon and cheese have enough of that. I make extra honey mustard sauce and marinate in ziplock for most the day, of course don't use the marinade for dipping. When camping we make it all in the same cast iron pan.

Beginner Cook.  Very Yum. I bought the family pack of chicken with bone (cheaper) and just cut the bone out of the thigh pieces. A bit more work, but not too bad for the price difference.  I added more mustard to the sauce because I thought it was too honey sweet. I omitted the corn syrup and the onion flakes.   I marinated my chicken with lime, worchestershire sauce, and garlic powder for 30 minutes. I sauteed my mushrooms first.   I baked for 15 minutes @ 450 (because of our old oven), and ended up having to bake at 300 for another 15 minutes because chicken was not fully cooked.  Awesome recipe after using review suggestions.

Great recipe and it does taste just like the chicken at the restaurant!  It's easy to prepare and this is the best honey mustard sauce I've ever eaten! Note-I did not add the corn syrup & used a Tbl of fresh grated onion instead of the dried.  It will be served in this house again!

This recipe was awesome!!! I altered it a lot I didn't use the corn syrup, dried onion flakes, parsley or the mushrooms. What I did was season my chicken breast like normal (steak seasoning) and let it marinade in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Then I cooked my chicken breast on the George Forman grill. I cooked my bacon separately. After the chicken and bacon was done. I poured the honey mustard sauce on top of the chicken breast, placed the bacon slices on top of that then topped it with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes (until the cheese melted). It was awesome and quick. My kids used the left over honey mustard sauce the next day with their chicken tenders. I served this meal with corn on the cob and broccoli.

I used what I had on hand, namely chopped bacon (vs. slices of bacon) and parmigiano reggiano cheese. I dredged the chicken in a mixture of flour and seasoning salt before browning. I left the corn syrup in the sauce - it makes the sauce thicker. I also didn't have parsley or mushrooms, so I skipped, but I'm sure they would have been excellent. The sauce kept the chicken from drying out; the breasts were quite moist.

I love this.  I have made it so many times, and it remains a favorite.  I use fresh finely chopped onions instead of dehydrated.  The sauce is so good!  Let it sit mixed together in your fridge for a a couple of hours or more to truly "blend".

Very tasty dish!  I can never find a package of 4 chicken breasts, always 3...so I cut each breast into two so I had 6 smaller pieces.  After frying the bacon, I removed it from the pan and then browned the chicken in the bacon drippings.  I cooked the chicken until it was almost done.  I then removed the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms in the same pan for about 1 minute.  I assembled each piece of chicken with the sauce, bacon, mushrooms and cheese and baked until cheese was melted and bubbly.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and peas & carrots.  A hearty dish that is rich and satisfying.  The whole family loved it. However, the sauce was a bit too sweet.

This was a complete hit with my family. My husband raved about it, my 3 year old ACTUALLY ate chicken & even broccoli (dipping it in that "miracle sauce" as we like to call it). And my 10 month old loved the chicken too. It was incredibly moist and juicy and the flavor was wonderful. I used sauteed onions instead of mushrooms as my husband won't eat them and cheddar cheese since that's what I had on hand. This is a new favorite. Thanks so much for such an amazing recipe!!

Truly delicious. I skipped the corn syrup, used a zippier mustard, and used precooked real bacon bits. It was a hit with the family and now we make it at least once a week.

This was very good.  Rather than having the chicken swimming in the honey mustard mixture, I only coated the chicken with it.  I then put a piece of cheese on top of the chicken to hold the mushrooms and bacon in place.  My husband loved this recipe, and has requested it since!

This tastes like bacon and honey mustard.  And I like mustard, but not when it dominates a dish.  I made this 2x because of the reviews.  The first time i made it exactly like the recipe and the second time I implemented suggestions from 5 reviews and both times it came out the same-it tasted like honey mustard and bacon.  Two of the six of us gave it a rating of 4 1/2, but them when I asked them if I should save the left overs for tomorrow, and they both told me no. Not a good sign.

This was an incredible dish, even the picky kids liked it.  I don't really like mustard that much, but this sauce is great- I'd make it as a salad dressing. Also, the chicken came out nice and juicy, although I think the cooking time should be slightly longer.

Awesome!  Here are the changes I made to make it lower carb: decreaase mustard to 1/4 cup; increase mayo to 1/2 cup; decrease honey to 2 TBS; omit corn syrup; add 1/4 cup Splenda sweetener.  My hubby and kids LOVED it!  I chose to decrease the mustard because one reviewer said it was too mustardy, and I'm not a huge mustard fan, so, I cut it in half. My daughter said "mmmmm, it's sweet and tangy!" before I'd had a chance to try it. Wonderful!
Feb. 2010- We still love this recipe, and I often make it for guests.  Soooo good!

I think everyone else has said how good this is - I just need to agree.  It is so amazingly delicious. The chicken was juice, and the taste was phenomenal.  I would not change a thing. I think this is one thing I will make for company in the future.

This chicken was GREAT!!! I will definetly make it again i did not use the corn syrup and the honey mustard sauce was still great! I sauted the chicken and the mushrooms in the bacon fat instead of using the vegi oil. This was great :)

Thank You I loved this recipe!!
Did change it a bit, instead of just the seasoning salt I rubbed chicken with a mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning. Also added about a cup of diced onions when I layered the top. Thank you for this recipe!!

This is a good recipe.  I am afraid that I didn't see what all of the "rave" reviews were about.  The sauce was really good and I will probably use it for other recipes.  I also changed the recipe a little - I added some chopped onion to the mushrooms and sauted them in the bacon grease.  That was a good addition.  I didn't serve the reserved honey mustard because I didn't feel that it needed it.  I will make this again but I do have a similar chicken recipe topped with bacon and cheese that is grilled that I prefer over this one.  If I can't grill the other, then I will make this one.

This is hands down, the best dish I ever made. I have no additional recommendations. For those that found this recipe dull, bland you either don't know how to cook or your making it wrong. For example, the recipe says cook bacon. One bad review said that it was ok but they would cook the bacon first in the future. Not cooking the bacon as the directions say, would in effect, be dangerous and ruin the dish. READ THE DIRECTIONS!!!!!

This was absolutely fantastic!! As suggested by others, I omitted the corn syrup and it turned out with the perfect amount of sweetness; any more would have been overkill!!  I did not pound down the chicken and found that I didn't need to; it turned out extremely tender.  I also sauteed the mushrooms in a little minced garlic beforehand, which went really well with the honey mustard flavour.  I wish I had put a little more cheese on it, but in the end, my Mum thought it was a little rich, but everyone in the family just loved it.  I am a Canadian living in Australia and YES, even the Aussies love this dish!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Rebecca!!  I will definitely make this again for sure.

I nailed this one first time!  I cooked for my roommates and everyone loved it.  If you want a thicker piece of chicken you can just sautee it longer b4 it goes in the oven.  I also used baby portabello mushroom slices.  What a great and easy dish.

I fail to see what is so incredible about this recipe.  I thought we were in for a taste sensation from all the spectacular reviews, but my husband and I both felt it was only mediocre.  I followed the recipe to a tee, with so subsitutions, following suggestions from other reviewers about sauteing in the bacon fat and this dish still lacked flavour.

I chunked the chicken and substituted real bacon bits to save time.  My husband loved it.

A little heavy on mustard - cut it down a bit, also you can leave out the corn syrup - too sweet. Otherwise fabulous!

Made this chicken tonight with some modifications. I omitted the corn syrup and added powdered garlic and powdered onions to a salt substitute and pepper and rubbed that on the chicken. 

I also sauteed mushrooms, bell peppers and onions in oil and a little bit of garlic butter.

Cooking the chicken at 350*F is a little low and would cook it at a higher temperature next time (like maybe 375*F). At 350*F it took 25 minutes. 

The sauce is delicious and love the melted cheese crust.

Wow! Yummy, Fabulous! My husband is raving over it! I took a few suggestions and incorporated them in this recipe. The honey mustard sauce was awesome. I omitted the corn syrup and used local honey and mixed half yellow and half grey poupon and since I was out of mayonnaise I used Miracle Whip! And I marinated the chicken in Worchester sauce, lime juice and garlic as suggested. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I used canned and sautéed them in the bacon fat! I grated 8 oz of the Colby/Jack cheese as I'm not fond of pre-prepared grated cheese as it is made with cellulose. I would rather not eat paper by-products! Also, if you buy your honey from the grocery store and not a local honey supplier check to make sure it is 100% honey. If you are having company, this is a must on the menu. You should be able to make this ahead and then bake it covered for about 30 minutes and the about 10 more uncovered.

I halved the recipe since there is only two of us. I didn't use the parsley & the season all but it didn't matter because it had to be the BEST chicken i ever ate. The Fresh sliced baby portabella mushrooms and crispy bacon mixed with the sauce was absolutely AMAZING.  My wife never uses sauce to dip her meat but when she tasted the reserve sauce she dipped every bite.  Thank you for sharing.

This is very good.  I used turkey bacon and omitted the mushrooms just because I don't like them.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the light corn syrup.  I'm glad I did because I think it would have been too sweet otherwise.  My husband liked it a lot -- he wants me to definitely make it again.  I liked it, but to me it had a little bit of an egg flavor -- sounds crazy I know but that's what I thought.  The only thing I could figure was that it was the warm mayonnaise that was the flavor coming through.  I will make it again when my daughter is over for dinner, she will give me an honest opinion.

Jackpot!  The dish was loved by the whole family, but I especially love the sauce and I will be using it in the future on seafood too.  I will never try another bottle again.  I used the Karo and substituted 1/2 tsp granulated onion for onion flakes. I sprinkled my chicken with a dusting of flour and garlic powder before browning.  Added a couple dashes worcestershire to mushrooms.  I will make this over and over again.

I made this recipe eliminating the corn syrup, using store bought honey mustard instead of the yellow mustard and honey combo, and adding a dash of dijon mustard. We didn't have colby-jack cheese, so we used a parmesan/mozzarella blend. This was a huge hit with my family! I highly recommend it! It was also easy to make, after you take the time to cook the bacon. I followed another comment and cooked everything in the same pan. Worked fantastically!

This chicken was wonderful! I did do a few things different such as marinating the chicken in half of the honey mustard for an hour or so before cooking. Per other recommendations I sauteed the mushrooms before putting them on top of the chicken. I did put the corn syrup in the honey mustard and the flavor was great plus it helped thicken the sauce. Will definitely make again the exact same way!

OH MY GOODNESS is all I can say!  This was wonderful.  The honey mustard sauce was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was so tender and moist.  The only thing that I would change was to remove the bacon.  The flavor from the sauce is so flavorful that it wouldnt be missed.  YUMMY!!!!

I followed recipe exactly and this just wasn't for us. We didn't like the honey mustard sauce at all. We are fans of honey mustard but this was a completely different flavor. Luckily I didn't put it on all the chicken or I would have had to throw it all out instead of just a couple of pieces.

This is a stunning chicken recipe!  Very tasty!!  The only change I made was to the mustard / honey sauce when I replaced the corn syrup with maple syrup simply because I didn't have any corn syrup and safe to say, it turned out great and very tasty.  May I recommend to cut the amount of ingredients for the mustard / honey sauce by half since personally, I do not see the need to have additional sauce being kept in the refrigerator.  The mushroom / Monterrey Jack cheese topping was fascinating!  I replaced the bacon with bacon bits.  To prevent the cheese from being burnt, I added the cheese on top of chicken about 20 minutes into the chicken being cooked.  Fyi, I cooked the chicken for 45 minutes at 360 degrees.  I served this great chicken dish with maple dill carrots and chicken fried rice and wow, what a nice combination!  The bottle of Chardonnay complimented the meal perfectly.  Congratulations to the creator of this very tasty chicken dish!

The only reason I am giving this recipe a 4 instead of a 5 is that it is really time consuming to make! Definitely something that you want to make ahead as much as possible (not at 6pm when everyone is HUNGRY!). It is worth the effort in the end and does taste a lot like a certain dish at a certain steak place.

Best recipe I have made off this site yet. Both of my picky kids gobbled it up! Took other reviewers advice and omitted the corn syrup and marinaded breasts first for 30 minutes in Woreshire sauce and minced garlic. Just DELICIOUS...

Very simple to make and tasty. I used smoked ham instead of bacon and make the sauce different as I dont have corn syrup or onion flakes. I used 1 part lite mayo, 1 part honey, 1 part grain mustard, with black pepper and a dash of tabasco for kick. Great with a baked potato and green salad.

If you don't want to taste chicken, this is the dish.  Next time I'm going to omit the corn syrup (it's way too sweet) and decrease the honey a touch.  I may also decrease the amount of bacon to one slice per piece of chicken.  I didn't pound the chicken and was fine the way it was.  Once I make the changes I think it will be 5 stars for us.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe! I can't wait to make it again...I did change a couple things: I used mostly dijon mustard and just a little yellow mustard. I put almost all the sauce on top of the chicken before baking (this makes for an extra saucy dish, but is great to soak up with some french bread!), used extra mushrooms, and a flavored Jack cheese! YUMMY!!!

This recipe was SO good and easy! I cut back on the honey a little, only because I had less than I thought, but it seemed just sweet enough.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and used a little of the leftover bacon grease instead of oil and it seemed to bring out the flavor and give a nice savory balance to the sweet.  In a pinch, in the future, I might use Real Bacon pieces - just to cut out that step. It has tons of flavor, so milder sides - like steamed veggies and/or mashed potatoes are a good idea.  This is staying in the recipe box - A+!

Great, and like a casserole, you can prepare ahead and put in the oven for a short bake time. A half batch of honey-mustard sauce would have been enough. Served with wild rice and fresh green beans. Hubby gave it a Two Thumbs Up. Thanks Rebecca!

Have now been cooking this for 12 years. Highly recommended as the ultimate prepare-ahead-of-time impressive dish.
Updating my original review from 7 years ago. Love this dish and have cooked it more than fifty times.
This is what I do: Cut each chicken fillet into 2 if small, 3 if med and 4 if large(cut through the thick end horizontally to make two thinner pieces). Otherwise the servings are too big. The pounding out is important. Forget corn syrup. Apply sauce before baking, but add toppings (and a little extra sauce) only 10 minutes before serving (or it all slides off).
I always double or quadruple the quantities as this freezes like a dream. I usually serve with new/baby potatoes which I wash and pop in a baking dish with a little olive oil, whole garlic cloves and fresh rosemary. Bake in the oven with the chicken. I then freeze the appropriate number of potatoes with the chicken (often in a pie dish). Great for the kids when we are away. I also regularly take it to my 82 year old mother - its her absolute favorite dish.
This is great for entertaining.Prepare ahead so no fussing in the kitchen. And everyone always seems to love it A LOT!

We served this at an early Christmas family gathering, and it was a hit!  My only suggestion is to cut the amount of honey mustard you make in half. The chicken comes out of the oven so soft and flavorful, that no one really used the extra sauce!

This was absolutely delicious!! I have to admit...I was lazy with this recipe.  I did not pound the chicken, I marinated it in honey mustard dressing for about 5 hours,put the entire dish ,with marinade, in the oven, and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. I added chopped onion, mushrooms, bacon and cheese and baked an additional 20 minutes.  I normally don't like when people completely modify a recipe, but I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  Even the easy version is tender and tasty and would be easy to make for company.

Very nice Some notes on my first attempt at cooking. 
I didn't bother trying to measure out the seasoned salt. . . as I trimmed and pounded the chicken I just salted each piece.  I also used onion powder in the mustard sauce since I didn't have onion flakes and I thought the sauce was great. I also left out the parsley. 
I served this at a dinner for another couple with kids.  Everyone, including some very picky kids (5 and under) gobbled up this chicken.  The honey mustard sauce tasted just like the sauce at a local restaurant that is famous for its honey mustard sauce.  Subtle, sweet but not too much, mustardy but not overpowering.  It kept the chicken moist.  I had the extra sauce on the table but everyone like the amount cooked on the chicken just fine.  
I also use the precooked bacon zapped in the microwave to make this easier.  
I will cook again and just loved it.

WOW!! This is definitely the BEST recipe I've tried from this site so far!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!! I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing, except next time I'll probably layer the sauce on the chicken, then the bacon, then the mushrooms and then the cheese in that order. This time I did sauce, mushrooms, bacon, cheese and it was kind of hard to cut with the mushrooms in between the chicken and the bacon -- they kept sliding out everywhere!! :) Or maybe I'll try crumbling the bacon a little bit next time... that would probably work okay too. Other than that, it was PERFECT!! It was sooooooo delicious and it was easy to make too! I served it with rice pilaf and brussels sprouts. My hubbie informed me he wouldn't mind having this at least every other week and that's pretty AMAZING coming from him! Thank you so much for posting our new FAVORITE recipe, Rebecca! :)

After experimenting with this recipe several times, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used the sauce recipe from Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken on this site. I was much happier with the results. I use a whole carton of mushrooms and a package of pre-cooked bacon. Add the cheese after the dish has baked awhile so the bacon can crisp. It turned out great. I serve rice and stir fry Teriyaki vegetables with this dish.

Delicious!  Quite rich, so I won't make it too often, but definately a keeper.  Next time I will leave off the bacon - enough taste without it. I cut the mustard in 1/2 and it still worked well!

A bit salty but may be related to the amount of chicken breasts used. I used 4 breasts, but could easily of made 6 or more considering the amount of sauce available. Next time I will either increase the amount of chicken used or decrease the amount of salt.

Out-frickin'-standing meal.  Make sure you follow the guidelines for the seasoned salt, though.  Even though I over-did the salt, it was edible, but a perfect blend makes a perfect meal.

Oh my Gosh....what can I say but another keeper:)  I used a Mexican blend cheese because that was all I could get at the grocery store and I was still very pleased with the results! The mustard sauce was wonderful on its own and would make a FANTASTIC chicken nugget sauce.  My family truly loved this dish and I look forward to making this dish again!

I USED 6 CHICKEN BREAST AND LIGHTLY FRIED IN PAN. COOKED BACON IN MICROWAVE. AS I MADE MY SAUCE ,TO MY DISMAY I DIDN'T HAVE QUITE ENOUGH HONEY, SO I ADDED MORE CORN SYRUP. I USED 1/4 TSP. ONION POWDER IN PLACE OF ONIONS. IT DIDN'T TASTE QUITE RIGHT,SO I ADDED 2 HEAPING TABLESPOONS OF T. MARZETTI'S HONEY MUSTARD. I THINK I WOULD ADD MORE MAYO FOR A BETTER COLOR AND TO TONE DOWN THE MUSTARD A BIT. I WOULD TASTE TEST THE SAUCE TO GET TO YOUR LIKING.(NOTE: MIX MUSTARD AND MAYO TOGETHER FIRST BEFORE ADDING REST OF INGREDIENTS. I FOUND IT HARD TO MIX WITHOUT GETTING LUMPS OF MAYO THROUGH OUT SAUCE. I USED 1 1/4C MUSHROOMS AND THEY GOT LOST IN THE SAUCE, I WILL DEFINATELY ADD MORE OF THOSE.MADE A LOT MORE SAUCE THAN NEEDED DIDN;T USE EXTRA SAUCE. I ALSO BAKED LONGER THAN 15 MIN. IT WAS MORE LIKE 25 MIN. UNTIL CHEESE WAS GOLDEN. WE WILL MAKE SOME CHANGES BUT WE DID LIKE THIS IT MADE OUR TASTEBUDS POP! THANKS REBECCA!

This dish will roll your eyes back in your head, it is so good!  It should be called "Awesome Aussie Chicken"!  I did make a few minor changes when I made it, though.  I was out of bacon so I just fried some chopped thin sliced deli honey ham.  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts and they cooked a little faster.  I sauteed a thinly sliced onion with some chopped fresh mushrooms in a little butter, to put over the chicken while baking.  Then I cooked the chicken in the same pan with a little more butter, rather than the oil.  I think the butter adds a lot more flavor, if you don't mind a little decadence now and then.  I also used shredded cheddar rather than colby-jack.  The honey mustard sauce makes the dish, however, and I didn't change a thing.  I'm not giving THIS recipe out to my family or friends so they can think I'm a super cook! :)  Thanks, Rebecca for an easy recipe that tastes like a little bit of heaven!!

This wasn't bad, but it didn't warrant raves, either.  After making it, I can't see what all the fuss is about, but I guess I feel the same way about the restaurant chain, too.  Overrated.

wonderful recipe!!!!!!!!!!! I don't care for the honey mustard dip. Maybe I will try different dip next time, but chicken was awesome.  I also cooked chicked in bacon grease.  I cooked bacon in microware bacon dish and poured bacon drippings into pan to cook chicken.  It tasted great.

This recipe is delicious and very rich! I use onion powder instead of dried onion flakes in the sauce so I can get the flavor without the little bits of onion.

Overall my husband and I enjoyed the chicken, a little on the sweet side for us.  Only one of our five children liked the chicken though!  I would make again for adults, just not so much honey and use a spicier mustard!

This was pretty good, except I thought the honey mustard was too sweet!  If I make it again I will definitely grill it first-to give the chicken more flavor.

Thank You so much Rebecca!  My husband and I absolutely loved this recipie.  It is definitley worth the extra effort, which isn't much! I didn't use all the sauce, so I will probably cut the ingredients down next time I make it!  The honey mustard sauce is incredible, topped off with the bacon, mushrooms, and cheese makes it one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had! This one is going to stay in my family for years to come!

My husband and I just loved this chicken.  It was easy and so tasty.  I did modify it just a bit and saved some time doing it.  I cooked the chicken on the grill, sauted the mushrooms in the same skillet as I cooked the bacon, then assembled the dish in the same pan to broil.  I topped the chicken with some prepared honey mustard dressing, added mushrooms, then bacon and lastly cheese and broiled until bubbly.  It was fantastic will have again and again!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I do not us all of the honey mustard that the recipe calls for while it is baking.  I have found it to be a little much.  I only lightly brush it on the chicken breasts before baking instead of using the whole half of the recipe.  I save the leftover sauce and use it for a pretzel dip, hard or soft.  It is yummy!

Great recipe - the technique and timing are perfect. I made a few adjustments: Saute the chicken in some of the bacon fat, and also saute the mushrooms with some sliced onions. I used bottled honey mustard sauce.

This was my first time trying this recipe. It was very good although the toppings didn't stay on the chicken too well I probebly overcooked it! The honey mustard sauce was very sweet. It was overall delicous my husband thought it was good. Next time I am going to try buying the honey mustard and cooking the mushrooms and chicken in the bacon drippings.I served with french fries. I will make this again!

This was ok.  Maybe it was just a combination our family is not fond of.  If I was to make it again, I would cook the bacon just a bit before adding it to the dish.

We (my husband and three children) thought this was great!  I halved the sauce as several people suggested and subbed brown sugar for the corn syrup.  I've made it several times and it has turned out perfectly each time.

My husband thought this was amazing and told me I have to rate it 5 stars!  I pounded the chicken so that I could pile it with mushrooms and cheese.  I used a variety of cheeses, one of which was a Monteray Jack with Jalapeno peppers.  The extra spice was great.  Cooking the chicken in the same pan as the bacon gives the chicken great flavor.  My husband saved the sauce and used it on a sandwhich the next day!  A great recipe worth the preparation time!

After reading some reviews, I halved the sauce and omitted the corn syrup.  This was delicious.  Great served with garlic mashed potatoes.

This was good. Everyone in my family ate it (w/out mushrooms)which is very hard to do. I did think there was a little too much honey mustard sauce, so next time I will halve it.

This was excellent. I forgot to read the reviews before making it, so next time I will try marinating in the worcestershire sauce, too. I sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter with pepper and Accent before adding to the chicken. I think all the cheese was a little much, so will cut down on that next time. I added a little more mayo to the sauce and I think I'll leave out the corn syrup next time, too. Will definitely make this one again! Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was a keeper. I marinated the chicken in Worchestershire sauce and cooked the chicken in some of the leftover bacon grease which, when the meal was completed, gave the chicken alone an awesome taste.  I thought the cheese flavor took over the rest of the dish so next time I will use a little less but there will definitely be a next time.

This recipe was easy to make and my husband LOVED it!  He said he could have eater Purdue out of business with this recipe!  The recipe yielded a lot of sauce however, I freezed the left-overs to use for other things.  I will definately be making this dish again!

Fantastic!  I made this for my husband last night and not only did he have seconds but he also cleaned his plate (not an easy feat for him with my cooking).  He also approved this as a great dinner recipe to make for his picky parents.  Upon reading the other reviews I omitted the corn syrup and the sauce was still splendid; however, the sauce could have been halved as there was way too much left over.

Yum!!!   I usually dont care for chicken breast because it's so boring...but this was great, the sauce was really good..and the best part...is my kids LOVED it..that never happens.

I left out the syrup... and it was still a little too sweet for me..so I added dijon mustard.  

will be making this again.

This recipe was a little time consuming but well worth the effort.  I was able to do everything but the baking in advance so it was a very convient dish to prepare for company.  The sauce and the overall flavor was fantastic.  I tripled the amount of chicken breasts, mushrooms and bacon, but not the sauce (there was plenty).  It was a hit with all.  Also, the leftovers reheated very nicely.

This was better than great, and easy to pop in the oven after church- I prepared the bacon (not done crisp) and chicken the night before. After cooking the bacon I browned the chicken in the bacon grease. Then I mixed the marinade and poured about 1/2 on the breasts,laid the bacon on top and into the fridge it went. After church I put sliced onion (cut into rings), mushrooms, arranged the bacon (one slice per breast) with cheese  on top(medium cheddar). Then poured the remaining marinade on top. This was a hit with young and old... even Shaina my 5 year old loved it. Tasted like a 5 star meal and looked like it too!!!

Great... almost a "10".  Preparation time can be cut by making sauce, slicing mushrooms, shredding cheese, cooking bacon, and seasoning chicken ahead of time.  This dish is good enough for company, or special occasions!

Delicious everyone loved it. Only a few changes I made. First I did not use the corn syrup for the sauce and also I sautéed the chicken in the left over bacon grease rather then use vegetable oil. Also added a few more mushrooms then called for. This was amazing and I am definitely adding this to my recipe book. Thank you

Yummy!  Followed what other reviewers said and marinated the chicken in Worcestershire sauce, lime juice and garlic instead of seasoning salt.  
Sautéed the mushrooms in the bacon drippings, then browned the chicken.  
Omitted the corn syrup and used a combination of stone ground and dijon mustard.

Fantastic!  I followed other comments and left out the corn syrup and used dijon mustard in place of yellow.  I fried two slices of bacon for each chicksn breast.  In the same pan I browned the chicken breasts and transferred to the 9X13. Then sauteed the mushrooms to complete.  About 15 minutes in the oven to melt the cheese.

OOOhhhh!  So good!  The only thing I changed was in the method.  We prefer chicken to be more on the done side, so I cooked the chicken in the skillet as directed, and placed it in the oven with the sauce.  While the skillet was still hot, diced the bacon and cooked it with the mushrooms, in the oil the chicken was cooked it.  When it was ready, added it to the chicken already in the oven.  It was perfect!  Served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Restaurant quality meal, with a cooked at home price tag!! Definitely adding this to the rotation!

This was an absolute success! I did not change anything, besides the type of cheese I used ( I only had cheddar). Will definitely make again.

YUMMY, YUMMY IN OUR TUMMY! As most of you said there husbands are not chicken lovers but they like this recipie. I thought to myself 'are you married to my husband?' so I tried it. Hubby LOVES it. I make this every other week with no leftovers.  Only bit of advice is to make sure you flatten the chicken well to crisp it up well.

Only used precooked bacon to save a lot of trouble with mess cooking bacon causes. It didn't look like the picture. But it was delicious.

Followed many of the reviews and cut out the corn syrup (my husband is diabetic!).  Made it in a cast iron skillet and used that right to the oven, not too much mess to clean up.  I liked everything about this dish; my husband was not overly impressed....still too sweet for him....

This was such a great recipe. I'm new to the kitchen world and it was fairly easy. The only issue I have is that it's pretty high in salt. Next time, I'll choose low sodium options.

It was very flavorful.  Didn't use the corn syrup but I did saute the mushrooms and the chicken in the bacon drippings.  Next time I'll use regular mustard instead of the Dijon that the second most helpful reviewer stated.  That gave the chicken a wasabi affect, causing some bites to flare hotness through my nostrils.  Don't know WHAT that was about.

We loved this chicken!  Even my husband who isn't a fan of honey mustard loved this.  The only thing I changed was that I drained the grease from the bacon pan and just fried it in that.  My pans can go from stove to oven so once it was browned I just coated the chicken, piled it up, covered with cheese and then it went straight in the oven.  My husband has already said he wants me to do this again!  I used fresh chopped onions, next time I think I will use onion powder just because of texture.  Served with mashed potatoes.  This has just become my new need go to when I want a little comfort food.  Thanks for sharing!

I got home late from work and wanted to whip up something really quickly--this was an easy choice since I had all the items in the fridge. I don't eat bacon so I substituted for diced beef brats which I fried until they were crispy. I sauteed onions and mushrooms in the sausage fat. I sauteed the chicken in a little olive oil and then layered everything in the baking dish. I omitted the corn syrup from the sauce, and used deli mustard, brown spicy mustard, chili sauce, and honey. I only baked for about 5 minutes or so until the cheese melted. I served it with some roasted corn and asian string beans with cashews. My 7 year old loved it and he is as picky as you can be. My friend  thought it was amazing and I will definitely be cooking this again. Great recipe!

This was incredible!  The only thing I did different was browning the chicken breast on the George Forman grill instead of cooking in oil.  Restaurant quality and fabulous flavor.  Can't wait to serve it to guests!  Thanks Beckie

I made this pretty much exactly as the instructions said. I had my doubts about it, especially after the reviews said to leave out the corn syrup. It was delicious just the way the recipe was written. I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely be making this again. My one concern with this recipe is it does take a long time to make. It isn't difficult or anything though.

This is sensational! It tastes wonderful and looks great on the plate. It wasn't hard to make at all. I made half the recipe as it was just the 2 of us. I didn't have dried onion flakes so I used one-half teaspoon of onion powder. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Hubby loved it and so did I. It would be great as a meal for company.

LOVED this recipe!!! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it tasted just like the Aussie Chicken dish at Outback Rectaurant! I made a few adjustments... I used 8 slices of bacon (Two for each chicken),  sauteed mushrooms and onion in butter, used 8 oz of shredded Colby-Montery Jack cheese. I layered bacon (1), mushroom/onion (sauteed), cheese, bacon (1), mushroom/onion (sauteed), cheese. Then i poured sauce on top and put in oven. so i did two layers instead of one. And again served with garlic mashed and salad

Loved this recipe.  Did not make any changes to the original recipe.  For me, the flavor was strong enough to satisfy my taste buds without overpowering the dish.  This will definitly become a regular menu item in my household.

Made according to directions with one small change, I reduced the honey, corn syrup and mustard by 1/4. Came out great. Super easy recipe. Family loved it, didn't have any leftovers. served with broccoli topped with extra sauce. Yummy.

This was good. Next time I make it I will probably tweak the honey mustard sauce since it was a bit on the sweet side. Also, the bacon did not cook at all in the oven so it likely needs to be precooked prior to layering on the chicken.

Used reduced fat mayo, bits of bacon, no corn syrup and reduced fat cheese. Delicious! I halved the sauce but I think next time I may make the whole amount.

This was outstanding!  I just flattened the chicken & sprinkled seasoned salt on both sides & put back in the fridge for a while.  I did saute the chicken in the bacon and used portobello mushrooms.

This was just ok. The honey mustard sauce was great, and the chicken was nice and moist, but I thought that everything together really lacked flavor. I had followed other reviews and marinated the chicken for an hour in worchester sauce, instead of using the seasoning salt. So I'm rating this as a 4 because my guess is it would have been better with the seasoning sauce. Glad I finally tried it though.

I use turkey bacon and green onion instead of parsley. All other ingredients followed exact. I cook the turkey bacon in a little bit of olive oil in my cast iron skillet. I remove the bacon and brown chicken. From there I proceed with assembly right in the iron skillet. I tranfer the iron skillet right to the oven. This is very good but although the chicken is tender, you will need a steak knife to eat this...if you try to cut in with your fork, all tthe toppings will slide off.

This was delicious! I didn't have fresh m.rooms on hand, so used jarred and also used jarred artichokes. Used bacon bits (I'm lazy!) instead of frying. It was amazing. Everyone loved it. So simple. Thank you for sharing.

This was very good.  I served this with butter parm orzo, & salad.  I also tried it as a slowcooker meal, which I would not suggest.  The sugars carmelized quite a bit and the chicken was a little dry.  I look forward to cooking this as written, in the over next time.

Very good! I used thin chicken cutlets, and they cooked perfectly! I sauteed the mushrooms in butter before baking the dish. Used turkey bacon since it's what I had. I also used half Dijon mustard and half yellow. Next time I think I'd use less yellow. I didn't reserve any sauce for dipping, so I'm going to cut the sauce amount in half next time.

I left out the corn syrup, because I didn't have any on hand, and I used spicy brown mustard. It was AMAZING! I will definitely make it again soon.

YUM! Made this as my youngest was going away and with family coming for dinner wanted something that didn't have garlic or ginger but loads of flavour - family member going in hospital for an op and certain things have to be avoided!
Anyway it was soooo tasty, loved it, will be one that I will be making regularly!!! thanks!

Mmmmmm!  Definately will make this again.  The sauce was a touch too mustardy for my liking, so I tried adding garlic to it to augment the onion flavour.

Wow!!  This was SOOO good!!  I took the advice of others and sauteed the mushrooms a bit with some garlic and parsley.  I also added some chopped avacado to the garnish.  This dish was amazing!! My husband couldn't say enough about it after dinner.  This will be the dish I serve at the next dinner party.

I made this with thin chicken breasts, so I sort turned it into a Alice Springs Chicken casserole with layers of chicken, bacon, mushrooms, cheese, and honey mustard. Served it with a side of garlic herb rice. It was fantastic.

This was sooo good!!  I made it last night for the family and they  were blown away.  I used dijon instead of yellow mustard and left out the corn syrup.  It didn't seem necessary to me.  I will make this again and again and again.  Thank you for this recipe beckie.

Tried this recipe last night, with great results!  A reviewer mentioned that it was time consuming, but I disagree; there are so many things that can done simultaneously that I had it on the table in an hour.  It was delicious, and received rave reviews from the whole family.  (Just don't read the nutritional information....)

SOOOO GOOD! I followed some of the other advice and marinated in Worcestershire for about 45 min. and baked for 20 min instead of 15, and I added the cheese for the last 5. Also I sauteed the mushroom and browned the chicken in the bacon grease!!!!

This was pretty good.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  The cooking time was perfect.  I would  not follow some of the reviewers who say to flaten your chicken breasts before cooking.  If you do this your chicken will be dry because A) your squeezing out natural juices that keep the meat moist, and B) because they will end up completly cooking on the stove because of the thin meat and then drying out in the oven. Meat should be raw in the middle by the time it enters the oven. 15 min in oven without flattening meat, made me some juicy moist chicken. Thanks!

My Husband says " This recipe is a keeper" I sauteed the mushrooms with canola oil and added salt and pepper to taste. I also cooked the chicken breast with 1 Tablespoon bacon dripping and 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil,also used thick sliced bacon. It was AWESOME !!!!!

I'm inclined to give this one 3 1/2 stars, but dh did enjoy it. Didn't taste that spectacular, the flavours didn't really amalgamate, or meld, but tasted like chicken, mustard sauce, bacon, cheese etc, it didn't make the flavours more than they were but was generally good because it did have bacon and cheese.

This chicken is fantastic! Although it's best as written, it's easy to make it (slightly) healthier and still taste rich and delicious- LOWER FAT/CALORIE VERSION: Rather that use 'real' bacon, I chopped up turkey bacon and fried it very crisp, adding the mushrooms and some onion about 1/2 way through. Also, rather than fry the chicken in oil, I marinated it for about 30m in about 2 tb low fat buttermilk and 1/2 the amt of season salt for 30 mins before coating a non stick pan in fat free cooking spray. The extra liquid that comes off the chicken from the buttermilk combined with the spray is plenty to cook it in. You don't get that pretty golden fried look, but once you smother the chicken you won't see it anyhow, so big deal. Also, use low fat mayo for the sauce.  Again, once it's all together, you will not be able to tell the difference. I also use less cheese, just enough to cover is plenty to keep it all together, or I'll put a slice of swiss (healthier than cheddar) instead. With these modifications you can have an impressive feast without the guilt. Also, this honey mustard is THE BEST. I usually only make the chicken for 2, but always make the full amt. of sauce and keep it in the frige. Sometimes I even make just the honey mustard to go with other dishes, it's THAT good!!!

i was a bit apprehensive about this as I didn't think the ingredients would produce a good tasting anything. But it turns out this is easily one of my favorite meals now.  everyone asks for the recipe when they try it.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for my New Zealand boyfriend and my granddaughter.  I read quite a few reviews and merged them together.  
Here are my changes (although I think it would be wonderful without):
I used 6 chicken breasts so I used all the sauce rather than reserve any.  I too marinated them in lemon juice, seasoned salt, Worcestershire and and garlic but didn't have much time so only about an hour.  I crumbled the bacon rather than leave it whole (half?).  I omitted the parsley (yuck).  I only used 1/2 the amount of corn syrup (1/8 cup).  I do agree that it would have been much too sweet with 1/4 cup and I liked the sweetness.  Some may want to omit the corn syrup altogether.
Now, the weird thing was I had to layer rather differently.  My granddaughter doesn't like mushrooms, so I left 2 breasts without and my boyfriend doesn't like cheese (can you imagine?) so I left 2 without.  My 2 had all the fixins!  I loved this and it was yummy for lunch the next day.  Takes a bit of time to put all of it together but well worth it.  A+ from me - thanks!

We(my boyfriend and I)love this dish!!! We both dont care for mushrooms so we left that out and it was wonderful! But some IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW: the honey mustard is a really sweet honey mustard (which we like) but good to know for those of you who like the more mustardy flavored honey mustard

This is the second time I made this dish. I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't want to cook the chicken in so much sauce, so I poured half the sauce on top the chicken to bake the first time and froze the rest. 

I just used the second batch last night and this time it was better. I sauted the chicken in bacon grease, then added maybe 1/2 T worcestershire sauce and a tablespoon of bourbon, and cooked it until it was a nice brown color. Popped it in the oven with only a little grated swiss and cheddar. Served it over linquini with the pan drippings poured on top. Everyone loved it.
Next time I'll probably skip the corn syrup, or drastically reduce it.

Nothing comes quite close in comparison to this tasty dish, except I found it almost identical to the one at Outback Steakhouse :). Tastes great, and is much cheaper to make. Thanks for sharing Rebecca!

Yummo!  This was awesome.  It IS quite heavy, so I'd advise you serve it on a cool day, rather than in July in Virginia Beach!  We all loved it, but none of us could finish it.  WILL make again, maybe in the fall.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a keeper for our family. I used only honey in the sauce recipe per a recommendation of a previous reviewer. I thought that was a good amount of sweetness. Everyone really enjoyed it and my kids didn't even realize there was mushrooms on the chicken. It didn't taste just like the "steakhouse's" chicken dish, but it was a great rendition!

I prefer to use O'Charleys brand Honey mustard versus what the recipe calls for (better flavor, and less time consuming)  Otherwise, very good.

This is a great recipe, I actually use the honey mustard sauce as a salad dressing as well.  I even used the Ready Crisp bacon (just zap it in the microwave) and this dish still turned out awesome!

This is a bizarre blend of flavors that we did not like at all. The bacon, cheese, and honey mustard competed with each other and it resulted in a dish that was just too overwhelming for us.  I went ahead and saved the leftovers thinking maybe this was something that had to grow on you or would be better the next day. Unfortunately, it wasn't.  We are not picky eaters and really enjoy trying different recipes, but this was too much going on for us.  Sorry.

Wow!  I went through the whole 'become a member' process just to leave a review for this.  I didn't use the corn syrup as I didn't have any, and only increased the honey by a smidge.  I think it would have been too sweet with the corn syrup, but it's all dependent on personal tastes.  I actually mixed up a tiny bit of the sauce first, just to be sure we'd like it.  It went over very well.  I have never seen my 3 yr old eat so much chicken.  And hubby said 'it's alright' which is great, because either he likes it or not, but he sure ate it.  Very pleased with this.  Will be making again, but not too soon on account of the calories.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!!
Update:  I have made this many times now, even with the calories.  I'll call hubby at work and ask what he wants me to do with the chicken, and he'll say "do the one with the cheese and bacon."

I had to try this recipe just based on the number of reviews. And it deserves all the rave reviews. Very Very Good and simple and easy to make. I took some good advise from the reviews and prepared the night before. I did not have any corn syrup so I just skipped it, and the sauce the great. Next time I will double the sauce and use some for the green salad!!!   The only thing I would change is more spice on the chicken, I do love the spicy and sweet combo, and here in Louisiana we like everything spicy.

This my favorite chicken recipe!The first time I made it I tried it a few different ways to see how it came out best. I like the chicken breaded and I only put a little of regular mustard and used dried mustard instead. It's great any way though!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!   Here are my comments:  In my opinion there's no need to pound the chicken, as thicker chicken is juicier.  Some said on here that the "stuff" falls off if you don't pound it.  BUT that was not my experience as I didn't add the bacon, mushrooms, or cheese until the very end.  No need to bake the cheese, as the chicken is plenty hot coming out of the oven to melt it.  I also made a quadruple batch of this and froze some for the night's I'm short on time.   Oooo I can't WAIT until a night that I'm short on time!!  lol!

Absolutely Wonderful! I made it according to directions and we loved it. I made a seperate one for my daughter (who hates mustard) with BBQ sauce on it instead of the honey mustard sauce and she loved it too! This is one of the best recipes on this website. And trust me, I have made A LOT of recipes from ALLRECIPES.COM.

I loved this recipe!!!! It was soooo delicious, I will make it again and again.  The one thing I would change would be to cut the sauce ingredients in half...I found there was a lot of leftover sauce.  But it was one of the best dishes I have ever made.

This recipe reminds me of something similar I had at a popular chain restaurant that I really enjoyed (Applebee's here in Chicago).  I made this for my parents.  I didn't care for it as much as they did (they LOVED it, I enjoyed it).  The honey mustard sauce was the best part, although it is a tad tangy....  It is good enough to use as a dipping sauce for chicken tenders and I'll make it for that purpose.  Now, for the preparation.... I skipped step 1 and instead, marinated "pricked" chicken breasts (pricked with a fork) in Worcestersire sauce and a bit of minced garlic for about an hour (one of the steps for a similar recipe on this site - Alice Chicken) and then proceeded to step 2.  This dish goes well with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  I'll give this a second try, maybe with Bar-B-Q sauce (?).  It's definitely worth trying again.

I loved this dish. I left off the bacon (only because I over-cooked it), But I do think the sauce could of used a little less mustard. Other than that, it was quiet wonderful. All the flavors came together well.

This was incredible!  I made it a day ahead and popped it in the fridge for dinner the next day.  Before baking, I let it sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes.  I baked it at 350 until it reached 170.  Since it had been chilled it took about 45 minutes to come to temperature.  This would be great to serve to company. I love that I can have it ready to just pop in the oven.  My whole family loved it; my kindergartener AND my 14 year old who doesn't like mushrooms.  I chopped them into small pieces.  He didn't even notice them until he was half-way through his meal. This is a keeper!

I made ths last night and we loved it! I used about half dijon mustard and half regular yellow, and the honey mustard flavor was great. It was easy enough to make on a weeknight after work, and the comments I received were that a restaurant's offering couldn't be any better. I might use a few more mushrooms next time, since although it looks like plenty when you layer them on the chicken, they shrink so much with cooking that if you like mushrooms, you might want a few more so they are a little more prominant. I wouldn't change anything else. This is a wonderful dish!

Wow!  This was so good!  I used monterey jack and cheddar (in place of the colby) and used some pancake syrup instead of corn syrup (because I didn't have any corn syrup).  It turned out perfect, quite a "manly" dish!

This was fantastic.  I topped the cheese with a little bit of the honey mustard sauce to keep it from drying out.  This helped a lot.

This was just amazing! I served it rice at my Australian themed dinner party yesterday and everyone raved about it. The meat was very tender and the sauce was just stellar. My only problem with it was that it took longer than the recommended baking time. Other than that it was easy to make and tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful tasting. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's really fattening - not for somebody on a 'cal budget.'

Fantastic recipe!  I made it without mushrooms, and let it cook a bit longer (about 30 mins total) because we like sauces that are somewhat reduced and thicker.  Very tasty and we will definitely be adding this to our monthly recipe list!

Tastes good everytime. I've made it 3 times this month and my kids always want more. Sweet and just a little tangy. I have also used just the honey mustard sauce with steaks and other meats.

Excellent.  Only used 1 Tbsp of corn syrup.  Flatten chicken so there is a slight pocket in center to hold sauce.  Cook chicken completely during browning as the cheese burns if you cook in oven too long.  Can omit onions from sauce if you do not care for them.  Will make often.

Great recipe! I used boneless chicken thighs and browned the chicken along with the bacon. The taste is 5 star, but the health factors took a star away. Will saute an onion along with the bacon next time instead of using dried onion flakes. This is a keeper. Thanks Rebecca

This is an excellent recipe!  I cook the chicken in the bacon drippings for extra flavor and often cut the sauce in half - and there is still plenty for dipping.  We serve it over rice - this recipe is always a hit with everyone!

I don't know that this really tastes like Alice Springs Chicken, but it is good.  Next time I'll use a deli mustard instead of French's and maybe leave out the corn syrup, it was very sweet.  It definetly didn't need all that sauce and I'm a big fan of the sauce.  My toddler seemed to like it almost as much as Outback's but her dad asked that I not put very much sauce on his next time so that he could dip instead.  I doubt anyone has ever used up all that sauce.  Still, it was very good chicken.

Great dish! Does well with chopped onions sauted with mushrooms instead of onion flakes. Use at least 1 cup mushrooms when making for 2 servings.  Only seasoning available was Creole Seasoning.  Went well.  Again excellent dish!

I'm calling this "Thousand-calorie chicken" in my recipe file.  It's sooooo good, but save up your calories for the day, because one serving of this is almost 1000 calories!  It's delicious as it is.  If I wanted to scale back on some calories, I would omit the corn syrup and use low-fat/light mayo. Keep the cheese fatty, though.  Who wants cheese on top of their dinner if it won't melt!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!@@@!!!

This was great!  I changed it up a bit, sauteed the mushrooms in butter & garlic salt before layering & also used a Jack Daniel's hot & spicy mustard, also used Mrs. Dash chicken spice to add more flavor along with the seasoning salt.  Wonderful & very fun recipe!

My husband loved this, and the rest of my family thought is was pretty yummy too.  I only added 1/4 cup of mustard since I'm not a huge fan of it, and added a little more honey since my husband loves the sweetness of it.  A big hit that night:)  Thanks.

This was quick, easy, and delicious.  We were able to make it at the last minute with ingredients that we already had on hand (subbing out carmelized onions for the mushrooms which was very good).

This was good,(but not spectacular)and it was enjoyed by my family. The sauce was outstanding, left out the corn syrup and used dijon mustard. I made extra sauce and used it with breaded chicken fingers found on this site. I would make it again.

Based on the marvelous reviews for this recipe, I simply had to try it.  My husband was hesitant when I read him the ingredients but he was in for an amazing surprise.  He absolutely loved it, as did I, and he ate two helpings!!  I had some really thick chicken breasts so after browning them, I felt they some needed extra time in the oven.  They didn't.  Next time I will stick to the 15 minutes oven time!  Oh, and I added a lot of extra mushrooms (our favorite, you can never have too many).  Thanks so much - this will become a "regular" in our household!

This was really good - even though I goofed up the recipe.  I didn't pound the chicken breasts so they were left in tact.  Everyone really liked it though.  Served with roasted potatoes, cole slaw and beans.

I made this for a second time, and I'm glad I gave it a second chance! It was terrific the 2nd time around. First time was OK, but the mushrooms were not cooked enough and everything fell over on the chicken after assembly -higher than the eiffel tower. 
The 2nd time?  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter with the chicken and I used store bought hormels real bacon bits instead of cooking my own strips-Sprinkled bacon over the chicken both before and after the cheese. It was awesome ! And the honey mustard sauce was Great. A hit , even with unadventurous DH.

I love this recipe.  I use all chedder, rarely have C-MJ cheese. My mom loves it and asked for the recipe.  She omitted it the corn syrup and added teriyaki sauce instead and it came out great (not too sweet).  We always eat this over white or brown rice.

excellent, very good sauce, I used it on a ham and it turned out great. The only thing I did a litlle different was I completely cooked the chicken first then baked, this way the sauce and cheese did not burn. Will definately make again

I made this dish for my daughter's birthday.  Following other reviews, I did the following:  didn't use the corn syrup, used lime juice and worcestershire sauce to season the chicken and fried the chicken and mushrooms in the bacon fat.  I also baked the chicken a bit longer and applied the cheese for the last ten minutes of cooking.  It was delicious.  I didn't think I would like it but it was better than I could've ever imagined.  I will definately make this again.

Wow... excellent!  Beting the bacon lover that I am, I found no reason not to brown the breasts in the bacon pan with about 2-3 TBS of the bacon grease.
This gave even more flavor to an already great recipe, Thank you...
The presentation is great for company

This was very very good.  My only complaint is the honey mustard sauce.  Mine came out a little runny and was very sweet.  Any suggestions on how to make a better sauce?  What I should add/keep?  However, very easy to make, very very filling, could only eat half of a chicken breast.  Will definitely try again!

We thought this was a good recipe and would make it again.  But, I would use less mustard next time as it seemed to have too strong of a taste of that for my liking.

I was so excited to try this recipe because my friend said it looked exactly like Alice's Spring Chx at "OUTBACK".  
So I made it and it was pretty easy and good. . .good if you want to feel what it is like to have clogged arteries!!!  WORD TO THE WISE:  I did what some other reviews suggested and fried the chicken in bacon grease rather than in the oil as the recipe suggests.  This made it taste unbearably rich!  I ate it last night, and now here it is the next afternoon and I STILL feel lethargic and unhealthy.  "IF" I make this again, I will definitely SKIP the "fry in bacon grease".

This was really very good...I made it more atkins friendly.  Substituted 1/2 cup of splenda for the honey and 1/4 cup no sugar pancake syrup for the corn syrup. Quite tasty and filling. Will definately make again. A unique blend of flavors. Will rate again when I can make it with the real ingredients.

I am trying all the Hall of Fame recipes. I liked this one much better than the overated American Lasagna. It was a little bit of work involved- cooking the bacon, frying the chicken,slicing the mushrooms, etc., but I must admit that my family & I liked the end result, which makes the effort worthwhile, at least.

Amazing!  Just like Outback!  So delicious!  The honey mustard sauce is delicious - tastes like Texas Pete's.  Next time I will only make half of the sauce because I had a lot left over.

This recipe has some unique and special flavors and is a welcome addition to my recipe box.  However, I could see that made "as is" it would be a bit "in my face," overdone and confusing in flavor.  When I made it I served it over rice with the following modifications.  I used dijon mustard and eliminated the corn syrup and dried onions from the sauce. Then I crumbled the bacon over the top; used sliced baby portobellas and saute'd them with some finely diced onion before layering.  Finally, I eliminated the cheese and covered to heat in the final process.  BTW - I also took another member's suggestion and used the same recipe for 6 servings, layering the breasts by 1/2 in the baking dish.  A green leafy vegetable compliments this wonderfully.

This was good but I guess that I was expecting that it would taste exactly like Outback's Alice Springs Chicken and it didn't.  My husband and my mother both like it but didn't rave about it.  I will surely make it again but will have to experiment with the honey mustard because there was a little something about it that I didn't like.

i've made this recipe twice, the first time i thought it was way to salty (and i'm a salt lover). the second time i rubbed the seasoning salt but didn't refrigerate it for 30 min. instead, i used it right away and it turned out awesome! a definite favorite in the household!

I am from Australia and this is not "Aussie chicken" we do not eat anything like this over here, so im not too sure why this was called what it is.
What we would call "Aussie chicken" is just roasted chicken with a stuffing, thats pretty much it. Though this recipe does taste really nice, though a bit too greasy. Also another thing Aussies don't eat much of or cook, greasy food.

This was very yummy!!  I attempted to saute the mushrooms in the bacon grease as other reviewers suggested...and I must have used too much because it was WAAAAY too greasy!!  I guess my thinking was, the more grease I used, the more the flavor of the bacon would be infused into the mushrooms.  Next time I think I will just follow the recipe!  :P  Very excellent recipe!

We have a family of four children, with two adult young men still living at home with us. All four children don't like mushrooms as a rule but, tonight, they enjoyed their chicken with mushroom. It was a great success. 
thanks.

My husband told me "you can make this anytime" - and it's a good company dish. The sauce can be cut in half or omitted altogether. The 2 cups cheese makes it very cheesy, and could be reduced to 1 cup. Thanks Rebecca!

Maybe I am spoiled by the restaurant version of this recipe, but I did not like the honey mustard sauce at all.

I made this mostly as written with the only change being I sauteed the breasts in the bacon grease instead of using oil. This dish was out of this world! My family loved it and wants it again and again. The sauce is piquant in a sweet and sour sort of way. I'm usually not a big fan of honey mustard, but this was not the usual. This sauce is a unique blend of sweet and savory with an earthy goodness. Not a whole lot of preparation, which is good, too.This is a keeper, Rebecca. Thanks for sharing.

I used many of the previous suggestions:  I marinated the chicken with Worchester, fresh garlic and a dash of italian dressing for two hours.  I utilized a stone ground mustard and left out the corn syrup.  I also left out the onion and mushrooms (we aren't huge fans of either).  I added the seasoning salt, lightly, before cooking, and fried the chicken in the leftover bacon grease rather than the oil.  EXCELLENT.  My husband, very suspicious of new dishes, said it was the best chicken he had ever eaten.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and breadsticks.  Next time, I may serve it over a pasta.  Would recommend to anyone for an easy dish with great flavor.

The only drawback to this recipe is the fact that it's filled with fat and cholesterol. Other than that it's easy and extremely good.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it.  My husband said it was second only to Anniversary chicken (also found on this site)  but my kids thought this was even better than anniversary chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used freshly grated cheese.  Will make this again and again.  THanks for the recipe.

Excellent chicken dish!! Easy preparation. My husband doesn't like chicken, so I had plenty of leftovers. Just as good warmed up the next day in the microwave. Could cut the honey-mustard sauce in half, but I won't - great on ham sandwiches or tossed salad. My mother wanted a good chicken recipe to make for her sisters who were coming to visit and I gave her this one. They all loved it!! One of my Aunts asked for the recipe to take home with her. Will definitely make this recipe over and over again!

I just made this recipe yesterday for the first time my sister and her family came over to visit my husband and myself at my new house.  I was so nervous as to how it would turn out, but I received more compliments than you could imagine!  Everyone loved it, and my gourmet sister asked me for the recipe!  woohoo! thank you Rebecca!  I actually followed the recipe exactly, but also browned the chicken and mushrooms in the bacon grease, which made it very unhealthy, but very very good.  Wonderful recipe which everyone, including my new husband loved!  Also very good for leftovers!

Yummy.  My husband made this and he added Mrs. Dash Spicy Seasoning & used PepperJack cheese.  He also sauted the mushrooms in the bacon grease, which made them very tasty.  We both enjoyed it very much.  THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!

I enjoyed this, but my family did even more.  This is unusual!  I did take the suggestions to cook the mushrooms, and do something else i'm forgetting was suggested, but my usband has insisted we add it to our dinner rotation.  First new recipe in a while that he's said that!

Loved this chicken recipe.....I did omit the corn syrup....thought it might have been too sweet...glad I did because the honey mustard was perfect without it. I also used shredded cheddar cause its all I had....great dinner!

Delicious! I followed prior suggestions and sauteed the mushrooms first. I seasoned the chicken w/ some Mrs. Dash. The next time I make this I'll use real bacon (I used low-fat this time...just not as yummy) and I'll buy preprepared honey mustard sauce from a jar. Surprisingly easy recipe!

My husband thought this was fabulous.  I liked it, but it isn't one of my favorites.  There are a lot of steps involved.  I think you could cut down on the work by buying premade honey mustard sauce.

This recipe is in the hall of fame for a reason.  If you haven't tried it you're missing out on a tasty meal.  As previous reviewers have stated, you could easily halve the amount of honey mustard sauce and still have some left over.

If I'm short on time , I find that a commercially prepared honey-dijon salad dressing works just fine.

This chicken is sooo good.  I substituted fat free plain yogurt for the mayo, used less cheese, and less corn syrup.  Everyone loved it.

WOW!  This was so good!  My husband loved it.  Keep in mind that this is very rich.  I like the others had tons of the honey mustard left over.  I steamed carrots and potatoes and added the sauce on top.  This is definitely a keeper!

A friend who loves this site recommended this recipe to me -- it has become a favorite recipe in our family!  I brought the recipe to my parents when I went to visit, and everyone gobbled it up!  This is so easy, and a keeper.  We used the extra sauce for dipping the next couple of days, and I kids would love this honey mustard sauce when dipped with "Famous Butter Chicken" tenders (also an awesome recipe on this site)!

I loved the honey mustard sauce, especially for dipping after the chicken was cooked.  I did not find the recipe made too much of the sauce.  I found the cooking time was much longer than recipe said.  Overall, it was a nice change from my usual chicken recipes!

Awesome recipe.  I really liked the combination of flavors and the dish looked really lovely. I did a few ingredient substitutions, like sour cream in place of mayonnaise, pre-cooked bacon and I cut out the corn syrup, but the chicken & sauce still came out wonderful. This recipe is a keeper. :)

If you are used to cooking this recipe is no trouble at all. After reading some of the comments I was afraid it would be time consuming but it wasn't. My family loved it and the homemade dressing was well worth it.

At first I was skeptical and my husband snarled his nose when I told him I was going to try it. We had a delightful suprise. I don't care much for chicken, but we both loved it. I will definitly make this recipe again. IT IS A KEEPER.

Served at our dinner party last night. Very tasty. Served over angel hair pasta and added some of the sauce. Took one of the reviews advice and didn't use the syrup. Not necessary. The asparagus added the finishing touch to a really delicious meal. I did a lot of the prep work in advance so it made it much easier to prepare and I got to enjoy my guests. Just had left overs for lunch. Would recommend and I will use this recipe again.

Honey mustard sauce was very good. I also sautéed the mushrooms first in some butter, onion powder & garlic powder. I marinated the chicken in 2 tbls or so of worestershire sauce along with the seasoning salt.

Awesome, I would give it 10 stars if I could. I had 6 chicken thin sliced chicken breasts, so I used 3 more slices of bacon. I also made 1 & 1/2 times the sauce and I'm glad I did. I have a bunch left and since all the ingredients have a relatively long shelf life in the fridge, we're going to keep it in a jar & use it on salads (best honey mustard dressing ever!) Total comfort food! The kids, husband & I were 4 happy clams.

I followed someone else's suggestion and marinated the breasts in Worcestershire sauce, lime juice and garlic for about 30 minutes before the seasoning salt step. I skipped the mushrooms, just out of personal preference. The only other change I made was to use a store brand of "smoky sweet onion mustard" instead of traditional yellow. This was easy, smelled delicious while cooking, and was very tasty and juicy to eat. I will definitely make it again.

I do this on the grill, its great, but I find the dishes name to be a stretch. I lived in Australia and finding corn syrup is to say the least a treasure hunt. Most Aussies don't know what it is. Golden syrup is probably the Australian equivalent. Also try pounding chicken breasts and merinating them in Teriyaki sauce. Grill, top with chopped onion, chopped green pepper, red pepper, crumbled fried bacon, mushroom, and cheddar cheese.

Yum!  You can definitely use one pan; makes the flavours even better.  Home-made sauce is much better, and doesn't have additives and preservatives.  I also used Dijon, and added a bit of freshly ground black pepper.

I followed another reviewer tip of marinating the chicken in lime, garlic, and worcestershire and skipped the corn syrup.  I didn't have mushrooms on hand, so I skipped those also.  This was amazing!  My fiancé is the pickiest eater I know and he went for seconds and packed some for his lunch the next day.  That in itself is a miracle! :)

Yummy.. but maybe just a tad too much mustard.  I did not add bacon.  When I'm at the restaurant, I always ask with NO bacon. :)

My husband loved it!!! I did make subtle changes. As it's not clear in recipe I fried chicken til done in bacon grease. I did as I read in comments. I sautéed garlic and fresh baby Bella sliced mushrooms. I used spicy mustard and mayonnaise for the sauce-Equal parts. It was quicker and easier than the recipe sauce. I think it would also be good to substitute spicy mustard for honey mustard. I forgot to put dried onion and it still tasted fabulous. But will add it next time. Don't forget to make extra sauce for dipping....... I didn't think I needed to but had extra and my husband loved it..

I tried this the other night.  I cooked the bacon and reserved the bacon grease and cooked the chicken in it did not add any oil.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of chopped garlic to the sauce.  I also used a small can of mushrooms.  Hubby not wild about chicken but he said this is a keeper

This was delicious after it had a little time to let the flavors mix. I liked it a tremendous amount the next night. I used chicken tenderloins and pounded them down to about 1/4 inch and they cooked up perfectly - moist and juicy. For the sauce, I added all the ingredients as stated, but I only used 1/8 cup of corn syrup. I sautéed the mushrooms in the bacon grease and crumbled the bacon and sprinkled the bacon and mushrooms all over the top with a little cheese. They were good the first night, and FANTASTIC the following night.

Was short on mayo so I subbed sour cream for it.  Was a bit tangier than the original version but was still quite nice.  Family loves it and will definitely make again

tried this one. was a little leery about the "SWEETNESS" of the sauce but it wasn't as sweet as it sounded. I used more bacon than called for, and added some GARLIC POWDER to the sauce.

Awesome recipe! Didn't have mayo so I used sour cream in the honey mustard, great switch! Also used the bacon fat to cook the chicken in, far better than plain old vegetable oil. Keeping this one in the back pocket to change the routine up.

I accidentally added the bacon and the mushrooms after the cheese, but that was probably for the better as the cheese did not mask the bacon or mushroom flavors as much as they probably would have if the cheese melted on top of the bacon and mushrooms.

Very, VERY good recipe.

The only difference I did was cook the chicken in the pan that I fried the bacon in. Next time I will go ahead and dirty another pan or drain all the grease first. I found my bacon was salty and the salty/bacon flavor over powered the rest of the flavors. In this case more bacon isn't better :( Next time - I will sauté my mushrooms first and cut my bacon up before layering it. I also do not recommend buying prepared honey mustard. The sauce was fantastic and my whole family loved it!

I'd recommend marinating the chicken in the sauce over night. I think it would help bring the flavors out.

I used this recipe to cook a special weekend dinner for my family.  We love it.  The food is delicious and it is so affordable and easy to make.  I would recommend to make 1.5 times of the sauce.  And cover the baking pan while baking it.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I didn't refrigerate my chicken because I didn't have time before my family arrived for lunch! I don't think it's necessary really. I used onion powder in place of dried onion flakes, and I omitted the corn syrup. The recipe was very good. We had as a side orzo boiled in chicken broth and butter with Parmesan cheese added once the orzo was done. It was a good meal. My family enjoyed it as well...there were no leftovers!

I'd give 5 stars but I don't make it exactly as written, mine is similar recipe but I don't use corn syrup or the vegetable oil: Lowry's season salt, 6 bacon slices, 1/4 C mustard, 1/3C honey, 2 Tbsp Mayo, 2 tsp onion flakes, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 2 C shredded cheese (colby/jack) or cheddar. Make it the same way except cook bacon crisp, remove bacon and use bacon grease to brown chicken. The rest is of the directions are the same.  Insanely Good!!!!

This recipe was awesome!  
My son's father said this was his new favorite meal (paired with a Arkansas Green Beans & VELVEETA® Down-Home Macaroni and Cheese, ~both recipes off this site).  And he is somewhat hard to please at times, so to say his favorite, means a lot.  I myself am not a honey mustard person too much, but I loved this!  
I myself made it as the recipe said, with the regular mustard and light corn syrup and we all loved it, But, to each his own.

Huge hit here. I did not pan sear the chicken breasts  prior to putting them into the oven. I pre-baked the bacon at 350 half way done. Broke it up over the chicken. Poured the mustard mix over the chicken & baked it at 350 for about 45 min (I split my breasts). Added the cheddar cheese on top & gave it about 10 min more. Yum! My son exclaimed "keeper"!

This was delicious.  I had tried the Alice Chicken recipe a few years ago and it was so-so.  Don't know if I did something different this time since the recipes are so similar, but this one was awesome!  I also did everything in one cast iron skillet.  Browned the bacon then removed, then seared the chicken breasts in the bacon grease, then assembled everything in the same skillet and straight to the oven.  Cleanup was fast and easy.  Even my kids, who are not big meat eaters, loved this.  My four year old ate two helpings, and that's a FIRST on meat!

Easier to make than it seems. I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the seasoning salt b/c I didn't have any. I also browned the chicken in the bacon grease. YUM! The only thing I might try differently next time is using a honey mustard instead of regular mustard or add a little sugar to the sauce. Tip: Flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin between two pieces of plastic wrap.

I'm unsure why it's called Aussie Chicken, but that is really of no regard. The sauce is delicious. The only thing I did different was rather than cooking the bacon prior to baking the chicken, I did that all in one final step. The bacon got nice and crispy in the 25 minutes I let the chicken go in the oven (yeah, I left it in 10 minutes longer.)

The sauce is perfect and the combination of the savory bacon and chicken with the sweet sauce was perfect.

Okay ladies and gentleman, this recie is delicious, but I pretty much pitched the metod. Instead of 1/2ing the chicken I cut it into strips and marinaded it in worchestershire sauce like another reviewer suggested. I baked the bacon and sautéed the mushrooms with some garlic. After browning the chicken, I added the sauce (minus the corn syrup), bacon (crumbled) mushrooms and cheese, and let it cook until the cheese was melted. I served the whole thing over pasta with grilled tomatoes on the side. You can feel your heart slowing down whileyou eat it, but it's worth every bite! Cheers Beckie!

WOW! This was so simple (great for me!) and came out incredibly good. My fiance was a very happy man! I did change this recipe up a tiny bit to suit our tastes. I first pounded 2 chicken breasts, sprinkled with a small dash of salt and pepper and soaked it in Worcestershire since I didn't have time to marinate. While I was preparing everything else I just let it sit. About 5-10 mins. I excluded the mushrooms and onions since I am not a fan. While I fried the bacon in a skillet, I took 1/4 c each of a spicy hot mustard, a honey mustard, mayo and a tbsp of honey which I basically eyeballed then stirred. No corn syrup. I didn't want the extra sugar and it seemed really good without it. I browned the chicken in the same skillet after the bacon was done adding a bit more Worcestershire sauce. I then just transferred the chicken over to a 8x8 pyrex dish. I placed the sauce on top, then bacon, then a light hand with the cheddar cheese. I'd say 1/4-1/2 c. Then I put foil on top and baked for 15 mins. Took the foil off and baked for about another 10-15 mins. Just watching it to make sure it didn't over cook. The end result was fabulous and my fiance couldn't get enough. He's a bacon man so this made his night. Plus it's really simple to put together. Thank you for the recipe!

This was good, a little too mustardy for me, maybe I'll use a little less next time.  I used raw honey instead of unhealthy corn syrup.

Not bad. The honey mustard is good but is better cold than cooked with the chicken. Not sure why the recipe calls for a 9 x 13 dish when that would easily fit 6 times as much chicken.

Everyone seems to be crying about the modifications that need to be made to this recipe.  I made this EXACTLY as directed (full amount of corn syrup, raw mushrooms, separate pans, full amount of cheese...) and it was the best chicken I've ever had, though it WAS incredibly heavy.  They say 4 servings, but this could really feed 6 easily.  But other than that, this recipe is spot-on, don't give yourself the headache of modifying it.

Did not alter the recipe at all.  The whole family loved it.  Everyone considered it a "do over".  The recipe makes a large amount of sauce for only the 4 breast suggested (we used 5).  (I'll probably cut the sauce in half next time.)  Thanks for sharing.

This was phenomenal but I did alter it by following the advice in Rolanda's review:  skipped the corn syrup, sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon grease, removed from pan and then sauteed the chicken in the grease.  I also seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powders, pepper and the seasoning salt.  I had to use sharp cheddar as that was what I had on hand.  This was SOOOO delicious and hubby was very pleased with it too!  Served with roasted broccoli and a simple pasta side.  YUMMY!

Delicious! I had to omit the seasoning salt and use turkey bacon due to DH's diet although next time I will use regular bacon (my preference!). DH says it's his favorite chicken dish now and I can fix it this way all the time! Thank you!!

Cut down the seasoned salt!!  2 tsp. is way too much, especially when using bacon as well.  I omitted the corn syrup as several reviewers said, left out the mushrooms (kids won't touch 'em), and sauteed the pounded chicken breasts in some of the bacon drippings.  My husband thought this was amazing, and I will make it again - but with much less salt.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!! I was in the mood for a mustard style chicken, and my husband wanted bacon, this was PERFECT!! We didn't pound them, just used regular breasts. My husband is also allergic to honey so we used the same amount of brown sugar, and we don't like mushrooms, so didn't used them. We also seared the chicken in the bacon oil rather than using regular oil. So flippin delicious!!!! And actually fairly easy, while the chicken "marinated" and the oven heated, my husband cooked up the bacon and I mixed up the sauce. Then we threw it in, and it cooked up really fast!! This could become a regular!!!! :)

This is great! 1st off my husband is honest if he doesn't like something... I could eat eat chckin everyday but he gets tired of it and we've had it the last 3 days so I was hesitant to use up the rest tonight but this recipe looked like nothing I've ever made so I went for it! Glad I did! He loved it! As did I. I made a few changes: I marinated it for 2 hrs in Italian dressing; coated in a flour, paprika, pepper combo, then put in pan a few mins. Omitted the bacon completely. Sauteed onions and mushrooms for on top. Same sauce except no corn syrup, and my mustard was expired:) but it was still yummy! Baked at 375 for 35 mins. I used cheddar cheese atop as that was all I had. So delicious! I hardly had to rinse my husbands plate bcz he was nearly lickin it off! Thanks so much!

The best Honey Mustard sauce I have found yet. I used onion powder intead of onion pieces so that my kids would not complain about "pieces". I do that in allot of recipies, and it works really good. Garlic too.

Excellent recipe!  I made it to impress my mother in law, and she was impressed.  I really wanted to see if it was similar to the Aussie Chicken served at a national Australian restaurant chain, and if I would have closed my eyes, I think I could imagine eating this in their restaurant.

I made this for my boyfriend on valentines day.  He loved it!  He wished I had made more of the honey mustard sauce to dip the chicken in afterwards.  I took advice from some of the previous reviewers and cooked the bacon in a skillet, then I sauteed the mushrooms & chopped onions (I didn't have onion flakes) in the bacon fat and some butter (i drained a little of the bacon fat out first so it wasn't too greasy).  This way only one skillet gets dirty.  Personally I would just use a honey mustard sauce from the store but my boyfriend seemed to like it better than the ones at the store.  So its just a matter of preference, I think this sauce tasted sweeter than store bought honey mustard.

This was the BEST chicken I have ever made, period. It was soooo good! Not sure how it compares to Outback's version, as I've never tried it, but I fear it might pale in comparison. A few things I did a little different... I fried the bacon first and then sauteed the chicken in the bacon grease before I put it in the oven. And I did not add any of the corn syrup in the honey mustard sauce, it was plenty sweet without it.

My family loved this Recipe, but I made some changes to lighten it up. I eliminated the mayonnaise, added 2 tablespoons of corn syrup, used only two pieces of bacon, and added sauteed sliced onions and mushrooms.

For a fast and really easy dish that is super tasty Aussie Chicken is it.  My 8 year old asked for seconds.  I did not use the corn syrup or onion flakes but it turned out sweet enough with the honey.  The chicken was so tender.

Great dish! I sauteed my mushrooms. I will probably omit the corn syrup and dry onion flakes in the sauce next time. I make a honey mustard with mayo, mustard and honey and it is just as thick and has same great flavor.

I have always loved this entree at the "well-known restaurant" and am so glad I found this recipe to make at home! We all loved it! Not exactly healthy but there is plenty of room for substitutions to make it less fattening....but then again why fix whats not broke. KEEPER!!

This chicken is AWESOME!!! I made it for dinner last night and everyone loved it. I was worried about the sweetness because my husband doesn't like sweet meats but the flavor was amazing and my husband raved about it. I didn't put in the corn syrup as I didn't have any but didn't think it needed it. The sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy without it. Will be making this one again for sure!!

i actually saved this recipe to my recipe box a couple of years ago.  I ran across it yesterday and finally made it.  Now I'm kicking myself for not making it sooner!!  Awesome chicken recipe!  Made it exactly as stated.  It will now be a regular dish at our house.  Thanks for sharing!!

heart attack in the making, but very good.  I marinated my chicken in worchestershire, lemon juice, and garlic.  I cooked the bacon, drained it and then added the mushroom and sauted them with the bacon for a few minutes.  I omitted the corn syrup to make it a little healthier and used stone ground brown mustard instead of yellow.  It's an excellent recipe and although I made changes to it, I feel that the base recipe is worth a 4 star rating also, losing a star only to the fact that this recipe will kill you if you eat it every day.

I changed a few things based on preference.  My husband doesn't care for baked chicken so I grilled it and then added all the other ingredients on top and melted in the oven.  I also sauteed my mushrooms in butter and worcestershire and left out the dried onion flakes from my sauce.

I didn't have seasoning salt so I marianted the chicken in worecester (I got the idea from Alice's chicken recipe on this site) and Montreal Steak seasoning. I also grilled the chicken just because it was super hot out. I didn't use mushrooms because my husband hates them so I caramelized some onions in the bacon fat after cooking the bacon. I served it with noodles and a salad with the extra honey mustard (which was delicious btw) I will use the sauce for salad dressing and a dipping sauce for chicken fingers.

It was similar to the Outback chicken. The combination of chicken/bacon/cheese was really nice, and the chicken was tender (I cooked for 30 minutes). The honey mustard sauce wasn't very flavorful, so I ended up dipping the chicken in BBQ sauce. I'll probably try this recipe again, using BBQ instead of honey mustard.

Unbelievably delicious!  I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time and I am glad I did on this one.  It came out perfect, even with the corn syrup in the sauce.   It was even better than the restaurant version.  I highly recommend that everyone gives this a try, because you won't be sorry.  Bacon, cheese and honey mustard...you just can't go wrong!  Thanks Beckie!

I made this for dinner last nite and it was a huge hit with my husband and two boys!  I  was a little worried while I was making this how all these ingredients would taste together....no need to worry!...  the flavors all blended together wonderfully.  My family can't wait for me to make this again. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, Beckie!

I tried this dish, Not big on my list of likes. I found it to be really salty and kind of bland, I'm a pretty good cook and can fallow recipe directions well, I don't think I messed this up that bad. Maybe thats why I've only been to that well known restaurant once....

This was really good and I'll make it again. But the sauce was kind of expensive to make, so next time I might just buy honey mustard dressing as I thought it tasted the same as boughten. I omitted the corn syrup based on other reviews. Also, don't cook the back too much before hand as it crisps up more in the oven, and the cheese should be added closer to the end as it kind of hardened on the top..BUT still good :)

This is the BEST! I made it for my family 'reunion' week we spent at the beach...my brothers ate every last bite, and sopped up every last drip of sauce. It's that's good. The only change I make is that I brown the chicken in some of the bacon grease, rather than use oil. I just don't see the point in washing the pan out just to get it greasy again. I follow everything else exactly though. Fantastic!

I've had the chicken dish at the well-known restaurant that this is patterned after, and this is absolutely MUCH BETTER!  This was so flavorful and tender.  The only things I did different were: 1. I sauted my chicken in the bacon drippings instead of just oil. 2. Instead of using colby jack (I didn't have any on hand), I used a couple of slices of swiss and some shredded cheddar.  Let me just say, DELICIOUS!  This would be one I would make for company. It was easy to make and very quick, but looked amazing.  I have to say that all 5 of my kids really enjoyed it, even the ones that don't like honey mustard.  Of course, I didn't tell them that's what the sauce was, and they didn't even notice.  This one gets 5 stars because it was easy and delicious!

Amazing!! I did a quick version with what I had on hand. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and cooked it on the grill. I omitted the corn syrup from the sauce, used light mayo, and a little less mustard than called for. I didn't have mushrooms, so instead I sauteed half a large onion and a green pepper, both sliced thin. I omitted the bacon and only used 1 cup of cheese to cut back on fat. Threw it all together and broiled it in the oven for 2 minutes. It was sooooo good and much healthier than following the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again for company!

Made tiny changes, but mostly stuck with it! Husband devoured it and asked if I could make more! He wants it for dinner again tonight. :) He doesn't like mustard so I was a little worried but apparently for no reason.  I left out the corn syrup, after removing the bacon from the pan, dumped half the grease out and sauteed 2 minced garlic cloves with half yellow onion (thinly sliced) w thinly sliced fresh mushrooms till just cooked, removed, used same pan to fry chicken on both sides, 4 mins each, little salt and pepper on the chicken w/ dash of cayenne, layered in baking dish, (chicken, sauce, onions & mushrooms, bacon) baked for 15 minutes @ 350, added cheese, baked another 10 and done! Soooo yummy.

Hello!!! This was delicious!!! I made a few changes, but mainly stuck to the recipe. I used turkey bacon and after cooking it, I sauteed peppers, onion and garlic in the grease and omitted the mushrooms. I added some cayenne pepper to the season salt because we love spicy food! I then cooked the chicken in the same pan. By using one pan, you get all the flavors of the dish. For the sauce, I reduced the amount of corn syrup to 1 tsp. and used mircle whip instead of mayo. I topped the chicken in the dish with the sauce, then bacon and veggie mix, then Jack cheese! Sooo yummy! I will surely make this again!***Just made this again. Used bottled honey mustard, turkey bacon and pepper jack cheese...still absolutely yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great! I halved the recipe, though, because I was preparing for only 2.  After reading some reviews I changed it up a bit, though, and it was outstanding.  First, I marinated the chicken with Worcestershire Sauce and Salt.  Then I oiled up my pan and saute'd my mushrooms.  Then I made my bacon in the same pan and with all the bacon grease still in the pan I browned my chicken for about 3 minutes on each side.  For the sauce I didn't use the corn syrup and didn't miss it.  I put the chicken in the pan, coated it in the honey mustard sauce I made, put on the mushrooms and the bacon.  I only cooked the chicken for 15 min @ 325 degrees because the chicken was thin.  When it came out it was so juicy and delicious!  I served it with lime juice on each piece of chicken and sauce on the side.  Will make again!

I was a bit leary of this recipe.  I like honey-mustard in small amounts and there was just SO much of it in this recipe.  I used probably about half the sauce (left the rest in the fridge to use for something else later), and it still seemed like a lot.  But it was really good and I was quite surprised.  I think actually the cheese made a difference cause I'm a cheese lover.  Left off the mushrooms since I dislike them.  Not only could the sauce be cut down, but I don't really get the point of the corn syrup.  Honey is sweet enough.  I think I'd leave that out next time.

This wasn't bad, but I don't think I will make it again.  Normally that sentiment ranks three or fewer stars, but upon rereading the recipe I realize a couple of the issues were my own silly fault.  I considered cutting the honey mustard in half but decided against it, and now wish I had.  I had an exorbitant amount of honey mustard, and I ended up throwing away the remainder because it wasn't tasty enough to save and use for anything else.  I apparantly confused the directions for this recipe with another recipe I was considering because I pounded the chicken breasts. At that point, I found cooking them for even just 3 minutes on each side almost cooked them entirely.  I felt like the various liquids in the pan diluted the flavors inherent in the dish, and simply adding more of the honey mustard did not solve the problem.  I also didn't like the way the bacon tasted after being sandwiched between cheese and mushrooms and baking for 15 minutes, but I don't really blame the recipe for that.  If I do make it again, I will just place the bacon on top right before serving.

Great party dish.  I doubled the recipe, leaving out the corn syrup and sautéing an onion with the bacon. I marinated the chicken for several hours, in the honey, mustard, mayo mixture, reserving half of the marinade to use as a cooking baste. Cooked chicken, covered with foil, without browning it, topped with sautéed onions for 30 minutes at 350.Added bacon and cheese and cooked uncovered for 15 minutes more. I never did baste it with the marinade, so what remained I slathered on salmon the next night.  Baked salmon is the oven.  That was delish, too.

Oh my word... this was so good. The only change I made was to only use 1/2 the "honey mustard" recipe. I served it with wild rice and salad. My family gobbled this up and called it the best dinner ever!

I worked at the restaurant this recipe came from several years ago and was quite surprised to find it here. It is one of the best plates found at the place. I have made a few changes to the recipe over the years. First I cook the bacon (either apple wood, maple, or hickory) as for the amount of bacon and cheese I  apply what I feel is best. Then I pound the chicken, drizzle with Worcestershire, season-all, and garlic powder. Saute the chicken and set on a sprayed baking sheet. I take the same pan wipe it out with a paper towel and then drizzle with olive oil. Once heated I add the mushrooms and cook until the soak up the oil and then add either Marsala or burgundy wine and cook down. Meanwhile, I make the honey mustard. The honey mustard, to me, is not worth skipping and since it is the same honey mustard used as a salad dressing at the restaurant this recipe came from I look forward to making this recipe since I know there will be some left over and that it keeps well (a couple of months). I also use it as a chicken finger dip. Instead of using onion flakes I use onion powder and this is put atop the chicken and served in little ramekins as a dipping sauce. This recipe is a crowd pleaser and my family loves it. So much in fact I remebe

Anything with mushrooms, cheese and bacon is going to get 5 stars from me. I marinated the chicken for several hours in buttermilk to help keep it moist. Then I lightly sprinkled it with seasoning salt before browning. I like to saute my mushrooms before I add them to any dish, so I did that too. I chose to use dijon mustard in the honey mustard sauce for extra flavor. In spite of the calories, I'll make this again.

I liked this recipe. However, I could have done without the cheese. I used bacon bits because it's all I had. I used some already made honey mustard, and added it to the mayo and onion. I would make this again, but my husband wouldn't eat it.

I sauteed the mushrooms, set aside, fried the bacon, removed, and then browned the chicken in the bacon grease. It was excellent! The honey mustard (without the corn syrup) was sooooo good! I will definetely be making that again! It's a great dipping sauce for fries!

This was a good recipe.  I loved the honey mustard sauce in this.  It's great to eat plain with some chicken strips.  Everything together in this dish went well together.  Instead of mushrooms, I sauteed up some onions and put them over top of the chicken.  I dont know if my bf really cared for it.  It may have been the honey mustard sauce since he doesn't like it.  Overall a great dish!

I held the honey mustard because my husband doesn't like sweet tasting food. The breast must be pounded to half inch thickness or the baking time needs to be increased. Very good.

I love this recipe. It is so tasty and keeps the chicken moist and flavorful. This recipe is requested again and again. I love it! I always pour all of the sauce in the pan with the chicken so that it is warmed up. Then I serve the dinner with bread and it wonderful to dip the bread into.

I changed a few things.  I halved the recipe and started out by marinating the chicken in 2 TBS worcestershire sauce, 1 TBS lemon juice and 2 TBS dried mustard for about three hours.  I left out the season salt.  I sauteed the mushrooms and cut the turkey bacon into confetti-size pieces before cooking.  For the sauce, I used a little bit of mustard powder and onion powder.  I also used part-skim mozzarella for the cheese.  Turned out pretty well.  Not wow-inducing, but I altered the recipe a bit so I can't speak to how it tastes going by the exact recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.   I did a few modifications as I did not have enough yellow mustard so I used Dijon and based on the other reviews I did not use as much seasoning salt.   It is very good and I will definitely make it again.  PS-I also did not use corn syrup and still had a lot of sauce left over.

My husband and I have made this a few times now over a couple of years... I noticed I've never reviewed it. So here I am! Its great... we don't change a thing. Just a note though... the sauce is sweet so if you don't like sweet honey mustard you may want to alter it.

We found this very tasty!  We mixed & matched suggestions from other reviews & were happy with the results. Most of our mustard was honey mustard and just a little bit of the regular.  No corn syrup for us and we of course sauted the mushrooms. Will make again.

I prefer to use a store bought dressing when making this. Its saves lots of time. Great dish to impress your guests with.

It was rather tasty. I followed the recipe to the T, except cooked chicken in the bacon grease as other reviewers suggested and covered the dish in foil while in the oven. Then placed the cheese and bacon on the chicken. Very similar to Outback, I saved money tonight because Farm Fresh had a sale on chicken breast. :)

Very yummy, Thank You.  The only thing I changed was:
I marinated the chicken in honey mustard then grilled for just a few minuted then threw it in a dish and covered with toppings and foil and put it in the oven  until it was done.  I didnt use the corn syrup at all.  Thanks again.

I have made this 5 times and 3 of which were to impress the guests. Something about the flavorful honey mustard (which I've never liked before te outback rest.) makes it addicting. I simply add minced dry onion and seasoned salt to plain prepared honey mustard now however instead of making that corn syrup concoction.

OMG, this is to die for.  We only make this on special occasions because it's not too healthy.  I cook the bacon in the oven then use a tbs of drippings to brown chicken in skillet.  I also brown mushrooms a little bit too, then I put in baking dish as described.  This is the best!

This is a great recipe! As an Aussie myself, I don't know why it's called Aussie Chicken, but hey, if it's good, that's fine with me!  I added a fair bit of crushed garlic, and substituted golden syrup for corn syrup... and it worked beautifully!  It would have been a little too mellow for our tastebuds without the garlic, but overall it's a great recipe which I've already used a few times and will continue to use in future.

These taste fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn't change a thing. I gave it four stars because it took longer to cook in the oven than the time listed. I have made this 4 times now and each time I have to let it cook for almost 40 minutes.

Different and yummy.  A nice change of pace from the same old chicken, and my kids ate it up.  I had to use cheddar because my husband is allergic to Jack cheese.  I also omitted the corn syrup per the other reviewers.  I chopped my bacon up so I could disperse it on each breast and I thought that was helpful because you really want the bacon/cheese flavor with each bite.  That's when the best part of the recipe - the complement of flavors - really comes out! Thank you.  Will use again.

This chicken turned out well. I used turkey bacon and bottled honey mustard dressing. It was decent but nothing special.

Yum.  Even my fussy 10 yr daughter liked it.  The sauce was tasty.  I use it for chicken nuggets and wings.  It is an occasional treat because of the calories, but it is very close the Outback Cyclone Chicken.  Thank You.

I found there to be way too much honey mustard sauce.  We had over half of it left, and I thought I put too much on.  The chicken it very good, love all the toppings.  There's just something about the sauce I didn't care for.  I think the next time I'll try simmering it in either a different honey mustard sauce, or in chicken broth.  Very good chicken, didn't care much for the sauce.  Thank you for the recipe though.

This was quite good. I thought it would have athicker sauce on the chicken but it thinned out quite a bit. The flavor was very good. I'd add more cheese, just because I love cheese. I served with onion rings and spinach. Yummy!!

Awesome! I changed it slightly as I didnt include the syrup, and I couldn't find the cheese on this side of the pond, so I used the maturest cheddar I could find. I also diced the chicken breasts and served on a bed of brown rice.

Combination of chicken with bacon is nice.  I'd like to crumble the bacon next time, it was too tough to cut with the side of a fork.  Maybe this would be better as a slow-cooker recipe, to let that flavor seep through a bit more?

My absolute favorite chicken recipe! I barbeque the chicken and sauté the mushrooms. I also slice the chicken, but not right through, before adding the delicious sauce to allow it to soak in. I have also served it on ciabatta buns. A must try recipe!

I was wondering how a combination of bacon, cheese, corn syrup and mayo could possibly be good.  I was skeptical, but went ahead and made it since it had so many star ratings.  We did not care for this.

I make a combination of this and the Alice Chicken also found on this site.  They are very similar.  Instead of making the honey mustard sauce the way this recipe states, I use the one found with the Grilled Honey Mustard Chicken - because to me, you just can't beat it.  This chicken is ourstanding...but with the amount of calories in each serving, it only gets made in my house upon special requests!  Thanks!!!

Really great recipe when you want that restaurant dinner w/out going to the restaurant. You won't want to make this every night due to the excessive calories and fat, but when you want to have a special night and splurge, boy is this good!

I followed the recipe, but omitted the corn syrup.  It was good, but extremely rich.  I agree with an earlier reviewer who said the flavours seemed to compete with each other.  I can see why this recipe has five stars, but in my view it was "too much of a good thing", what with honey mustard, cheese AND bacon.  I think I might try it again, but only with the honey mustard sauce and mushrooms.

This was very easy and delicious.  I always order this when we go to Outback, and it is very close.  I used a little more bacon, a little less cheese, and a bit less sauce.  Thanks for this recipe!  You did good!

Excellent recipe for anyone with a sweet tooth! Keep in mind all the sugar you are adding, if that is an issue for health/dieting reasons. Hubby LOVES sweets and mustards, so this went over big; this great sauce made a little extra - so I'll cut back (just a pinch for two people) next time. Definately a new favorite in this house!

This chicken was great! Loved It! It will definately be made again. A few things...I diced the mushrooms small and used more than a cup. (I love mushrooms), I also cut the bacon into quarters, and we didn't use the leftover sauce.

Turned out great, everyone loved it. Made a few minor changes, I did not add the entire amount of corn syrup, just a splash of it and used Emeril's Dijon Mustard. Did not put cheese on right away during baking, so it would not burn.

I love, love, love this dish.  I have made it several times and it's always a big hit. The first time I made it I didn't have any cheese on hand so I did without and it was so good that I have never put cheese on it.  I serve it over white rice, add crusty bread and a tossed salad and it's a fantastic meal.

Mixed reviews in my household - I give it four stars, my husband didn't like it at all, my son (5) barely picked at it, but both of my daughters (19 mos and 8) loved it.  So it just really depends on how well you like chicken, mustard, mushrooms and bacon all mixed together.

Removed the corn syrup and added a dash of horseradish and old bay to the sauce. Also, just toss the breast on the grill to cook, un pounded, its much faster and in my opinion, better.

I should have viewed all the ratings.  My family did not like this at all.  I think it mainly had to do with the fact we are not big mustard eaters. Thanks for the dish anyways Rebecca!

I've just made this for my Aussie boyfriend for his birthday. Absolutely delicious! One of the best chicken recipes on this site. What I love about this is that, just like the Aussie Works Burger, it mounts everything good under the sun onto the chicken and it blends perfectly. I didn't have any corn syrup for the sauce but it came out wonderful. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and some of the honey-mustard sauce on the side. 5 stars +.

I'm so sorry to say that we were terribly disappointed in this dish. I guess I should have realized that it would be far too heavy and rich for our taste... but the sodium factor was the real deal-breaker for us. Yeeks... we must've downed a gallon of water between us apres meal. It sure did sound good, though, and it's likely just a matter of taste (pun intended). Thanks for sharing, though. ;)

What a terrific dish-  I used a stone-ground mustard and skipped the corn syrup for the dressing.  It made way too much dressing, you really only need 1/2 the amount.  I made fresh asparagus with garlic and olive oil to go along with it, perfect!  My fiance' thought it was one of my best meals ever.

I made this yesterday for mother's day and it was really good.  Mom loved it and wanted me to write down the recipe as soon as she took the first bite.  Also the honey mustard was great and I might make it by itself for chicken and salads mmmmmmmmmmmm good!

I make this dish all the time! Our whole family loves it, including my 3 year old. I only use the grey poupon mustard for the honey mustard sauce because I think it makes it taste so much better than regular yellow mustard. Absolutely delish!

This was a great recipe. My husband always orders this chicken at the "famous steakhouse" and this was quite similar. I made it the night before and baked it without the cheese ontop, just to cook the chicken. I refrigerated it until the next day, and topped with cheese and heated up. Chicken was tender and moist, topping and sauce were wonderful.  Great for make ahead meals.

I followed the advice of reviewers and added some worcestershire & garlic to the seasoning salt/chicken; I wouldn't add the worcestershire again; I think there was a slightly odd taste that didn't go with the honey-mustard sauce.  I also omitted the Karo light syrup.  For mustard, I used half coarse mustard and half American yellow mustard.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I'm not a big honey-mustard fan, but my husband liked it.

I used the old george forman to brown the chicken. i also used thick cut bacon instead of regular bacon(I chopped the bacon into tiny pieces with that magic chef chopper). I used onion powder instead of the onion flakes. When i layered it in the dish I made sure i got the sauce on both sides of the chicken. I then did a layer of mushrooms try and overlap them cuz they shrink and i ended up wanting more. I then sprinkled the bacon on top, then i drizzled more sauce over that, then i did the cheese.

One of the best chicken recipes I have ever made/tasted. I have used it for dinner parties and have had perfect reviews! I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe. We serve it with rice and a nice tossed salad and serve the extra sauce on the table with the meal.

Easy to make, but I think you have to really like mustard to love this dish.  It was ok to me, pretty tangy due to the amount of mustard so my 8 yr old didn't like it.  Probably won't make again, although maybe would try something modified w/o the mustard.  Also didn't use mushrooms, which may bring down the tanginess factor, but the fam won't eat them.

I thought this was very good.  The only thing I left out was the mushrooms, because no one here likes them.  Overall, everyone in my family liked this recipe.

This recipe tastes pretty good!  I've made it for groups of people and always received compliments from it.  The changes I made were small: I omitted the corn syrup the second time around (too sweet and syrupy), cooked the mushrooms before baking, made half the sauce, and used Dijon instead of regular mustard.  Also, don't overdo it on the cheese, this makes it rather greasy and masks the honey-mustard flavor.  I prefer to used diced onions instead of flakes.

This was ok. The sauce was great as per the recipe. It was something different, however I would recommend crumbling or chopping up the bacon to make it easier to eat. DON"T make the mistake I did and use reduced fat cheese (it was an accident) I asked my family to take a vote if they would want me to make it again and these were the replies: Husband: Its good
my mom: Well what do you think
my dad: Every six months would be ok. 
It wasn't bad at all, just not outrageous as I was hoping. I was disappointed.

I left out the karo and onion flakes.  It was pretty good but way too salty with the cheese,bacon and seasoning salt. Might make again with some adjustments.

We made this for an easy Sat evening dinner w/ friends. While we love bacon,  I used turkey bacon instead. Prepped early in the day a popped in the fridge until ready - increase cooking time by 15-20 minutes if you put in the fridge.  Guests asked for the recipe!  It was a hit.

This recipe is awesome as written. Never a bite left when I serve it. I leave out the Karo just to make it a little healthier. I bake the chicken in a baking dish for 30 min at 400, drain it and then add the sauce, etc. Just saves a step and I don't have to watch it as closely. I cook the bacon in the oven at the same time.

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of 5 is beacuse if you use all the honey and corn syrup the sauce would be way too sweet.  I didn't use a drip of corn syrup and it was perfect.  Other than that I followed the recipe as stated and it was great.

Awesome! I used to work at the restaurant that makes this for many years and it does taste just like it, I couldn't believe it! My family loved this and my daughter had a blast helping me make it. I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease as mentioned on another review.  Thanks for posting this!

I REALLY liked this chicken dish!  It was easy to make and the sauce was yummy!  I did have a lot of the sauce left over.  I could have made 4 more chicken breast with the amount of sauce I had.  I also did not use the mushrooms.

Excellent!!!!!!!!  We used the bacon dripping to cook the chicken instead of oil, more flavor, less trouble.  Next time will cut up bacon before frying so will be easier to eat.  I'm sure this will not look as pretty.  My daughter helped prepare and everyone just loved this (including me - and I'm not a big chicken fan.  The honey mustard sauce is a A+, better than any you could buy.  Thanks sooo much!!!!!!!!!

Th is SO GOOD! At first it didn't sound too good, but the amount of ratings it got convinced me to try. Was I wrong! All the flavors wonderfully melt into one another, while still popping out at you. You have to be cautious of the amount of mushrooms you put, though - if you don't particulary love them, put a small amount. Simply put, the recipe's flavor is just excellent.

My husband loved this!  He said, this is "make for company good, save this recipe!".  He always says that he likes my cooking, but never raved about anything as much as this.

Wow.  This recipe was delicious and my family LOVED it!  It reminds me of a dish they serve at Ruby Tuesdays.  It does take a little longer to prepare, but not by much, and the effort is worth it. I too, might omit the corn syrup next time or reduce the amount.  It was a little sweet, but to save calories, it would still taste delicious without it. I had a lot of sauce left over, and was able to refridge it for something else.  I used the pre-cooked bacon to make it easier too.  I will definitely make this recipe again...my hubby devoured it and made those mmmmm....mmmm....mmmm noises!!

I loved this dish. I did change a few things though. I cut the chicken into small pieces since I have severla smaller children. I sauteed the chicken in the bacon fat instead of another skillet and I also sauteed the mushrooms before adding them to the casserole. I will definitely be maing this again.

My family loved this recipe.  I thought the mushrooms and mustard sauce would scare them off, but it didn't.  I used less cheese and less corn syrup.  I only had about 1-2 TBSP honey, so I added 1 TBSP sugar.  It turned out great that way.  I didn't use the reserved sauce on the side, so next time I'll just make 1/2 the sauce.

I would give this recipe a hundred stars if I could!  I followed the recipe exactly, and there's nothing I would change other than possibly crumbling the bacon (or was I supposed to do that?)  EVERYONE in my family loved this, it will become a regular in the 'rotation'.  Thanks Rebecca!!!

This is so amazing. A few things I did different though. I cut the chicken breasts into chunks instead. (a little bigger than cubed) I omitted the mushrooms because our family does not like them.  And sliced the bacon into tiny pieces and scattered it across the chicken.

Excellent recipe!  Something different is always great.  Cheddar's has a very similar honey dijon chicken served over a bed of rice, so I did the same.  Used Grey Pupon (probobly mispelled).  Did not change a thing and will be making this again. Thanx!

The only change I made was I breaded and fried the chicken.  (made chicken cutlets)  Everything tastes better breaded and fried, right?  Anyhow, it was great and I received many compliments.  Thank you.  I'll be making this again.

I can't say enough about this recipe. My whole family kept on saying how good this was all through dinner(even my very picky 11-yr old daughter).  The chicken came out tender and juicy and the honey mustard sauce was excellent.I used real onions instead of onion flakes(didn't have any). And next time, I will add more mushrooms. This is going into my permanent recipe collection.

This was a great hit. The first time I made it, I didn't have all the ingrediants, but I made it with american cheese (just regular cheese slices) and a ton of mushrooms and it still turned out amazing. Everyone loved it. The second time, I decided to just buy the honey mustard since I didn't have any corn syrup, and it turned out just as good and a lot simpler. You hav to buy more than one bottle though (maybe like 1.5 bottles). i got the french's honey mustard. I also added a lot more mushrooms than was called for, since my family loves mushrooms.

I made this as directed with only a couple changes, I sauteed the mushrooms and some fresh onion, and browned the chicken breast in the bacon grease.  Though I didn't try it myself (vegetarian) my company and family loved it.  Thank you for this, it was a winner recipe that I'll make for guests again, it's simple but a big pleaser!

Excellent! I serve this with Oven Brown Rice (recipe found on this site). Everyone loved it, even though my husband was sceptical at first.... I also halved the sauce recipe. If you make all of the sauce, don't worry, it's so good, you could use the left over as a condiment, a dipping sauce, or salad dressing. It's that good.

Family loved this recipe.  Will make again.  I sauted chicken in bacon grease to add more flavor to chicken. I did not make honey mustard sauce from scratch.  I used Marie's honey mustard and added sauted onions to sauce.

This chicken has a unique and wonderful flavor to it. As suggested in a previous review, I made only half of the amount of sauce called for in the recipe. I then saved just a small portion of it, and when the chicken came out of the oven, I drizzled it over the chicken. I also used raw, finely diced onions instead of onion flakes, and the subtle flavor of the onions permeated the dish perfectly! Also, I used sugar in the place of corn syrup (since I didn't have any on hand) and the recipe still turned out great. Lastly, I used all organic ingredients (as I always do), and this dish tasted awesome....one of my husband's favorites! This one's a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Very, very yummy!  One hint to help you save time w/o sacrificing flavor- use T. Marzetti Honey Dijon dressing found in the refrigerated section.  Just as good as the sauce you make with the recipe, without the extra time!

Mmmm....Mmmmm....Delicious!  I was searching for a main dish to cook for my boyfriend and my roommate and came across this recipe.  After reading the reviews, it sounded like something I should try, and am I ever glad I did--It was a hit.  Everyone raved about the sauce especially.  Excellent recipe--Something I'm going to cook again and again!

This is an excellent chicken dish, with the bacon, mushrooms, honey mustard, and cheese...how can you go wrong?!?  I ommitted the mayo, mustard, and honey, and instead I used a honey mustard marinade.  My whole family loved it...even the kids!

This Recipe was Outstanding ! This was probably one of the best chicken dishes that I have ever had.  I actually cheated with the Bacon by just adding a bag of the Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Recipe/Pieces and just topped the chicken with that instead of the 6 slices of bacon cut in half.  Plus I also used fresh portabella mushrooms too.  I did use the dried onion flakes.  So thank you so much for this wonderful recipe my husband & I truely enjoyed it.  I made The Best Mashed Potaotes recipe as one of the side dishes which is also a All Recipes Recipe.................

YUMMMY!  this recipe was great.  It turned out just like the popular restaurant version.  2 Cups of cheese was a little too much, I only used one. I also had cream cheese on hand so I stuffed the chicken with cream cheese, bacon and mushrooms instead of pounding it.   I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe... I love this website!!!!

This was pretty good!  I forgot to flatten the chicken out, so mine tasted more chicken-y than it probably would have if I had not missed that step.  It was very tasty and I used the honey mustard from the Honey Mustard II recipe on this site.  YUM!  Just a suggestion, but you might want to add that part about flattening the chicken to the directions instead of listing as if already done in the ingredient list.  Thanks for a great recipe:)

Great recipe - all favorite ingredients (yet skipped parsley/shrooms).  Will buy the already chopped bacon in packaged deli to save time.  Also, didn't need to make all the sauce - halve it if you don't want for dipping plus great idea instead of pounding breasts to simply slice them in half.  Family agreed - keeper.

Wow!  This was so different from anything our family had ever tried, that I was a little apprehensive, but I am so glad that I gave it a shot.  Great combination of flavors and textures.  Even the little ones came back for more-  Yummy!

This was good but more expensive to make than to actually go to Outback and order it.

I followed this recipe exactly.
Bacon was way to crisp after baking it in the oven.(almost burnt)Just keep in mind the recipe cooks it twice.
Had a ton of sauce left over and didn't care for it.
Great reviews from alot of others...My family just didn't like it.I give it a 2 because it was fun to make.

Yummy!  I'm not a big fan of mustard.  But the corn syrup helps to tone down the sharpness of the mustard.  I didn't follow the recipe excatally,  I was short on time.  But, it still came out delicious.  First, I didn't marinate it for 30min.  I think it was 15min, I didn't have light corn syrup only had dark on hand so I used that, and I used canned mushrooms, broied in butter- green giant brand, then I didn't even flatten out the chicken breast.  Oh yeah, I didn't use the dried onion flakes didn't have that either.  I used about a 1/2 tsp. of onion powder.  Poured a little bit of the sauce on the bottem of 13X9 in pan then put the chicken breasts on the more sauce, then mushrooms, then bacon and then the cheese.  My husband wasn't feeling very well tonight.  He said, "I'm sick and I still ate it".  Usually when he's sick he dosn't really have an appitite.  I highly recomend this recipe, very easy to make.  Now I want to try the actuall dish from the famous steak resturant and see if this is close, if not it's still good in my book....

I had to write a review.  This recipe was unbelievable!  I served it for a bon-vayage dinner.  It was a bit time consuming but very easy to make!  I followed it exactly.  

I doubled the recipe and used 8 thin chicken breast fillets, one 12 oz. jar of orange mandarin honey, one 8 oz jar of dijon mustard, and 3 boxes of mushrooms which I grilled first.  I also used an additional 1/2 fresh onion (also sauteed) and added about 4 cloves of fresh garlic to the mushrooms.  I covered the chicken with foil in the stove for about 15-20 minutes then baked for an additonal 5 min (adding cheese last) until melted.  I served this dish with scalloped potatoes, corn, and garlic bread.  I can't wait to make this again!  I forgot to add the parsley the last second but it was awesome!  I hope this review helps!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I must be one of the very few that don't like this. To me, it just wasn't very good. It was way too sweet and the sweetness didn't blend well with the earthy flavor of the fresh mushrooms.

Make sure you pound the chicken.  It will take forever to cook unless the chicken is properly pounded.  Generally, I thought this was a great recipe.  The honey mustard sauce was great.  I sauteed the mushrooms before I put them to bake with the chicken.  Also, I served it with scalloped potatoes instead of pasta.  A big hit with the family.

Oh,my. This is awful.After reading many of the reviews, and growing confident (with reservations)of the recipe I tried it. Twice. Horrors! The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter. The second time I made some slight alterations.

I'm not certain what went wrong with this recipe, but it was pretty terrible.  My adult son, who loves chicken any way, ate it to be a good sport but refused the leftovers!  That just doesn't happen.  I followed the recipe exactly except to reduce the amount of cheese. Certainly that couldn't have affected the taste that much!

This was good, definitely.  After trying it though, I found a recipe extremley similar, but even better tasting.  Instead of cooking the bacon beforehand, you let the bacon cook on top of the chicken.  This added to the flavor tremendously.

My Fiance loved this!  He has been asking for bacon ever since!  However, i did not use the corn syrup, mayo or onion flake.  I just fried the bacon, sauted the mushrooms, and cooked the chicken on the stovetop.  Then i put mustard mixed with honey, on the chicken, followed by the bacon, mushrooms and cheese.  Delish!

This is a nice change...lowered the fat content by using turkey bacon...light mayo...only 1 cup of cheese...this is more than enough...cooked the chicken in chicken broth...wonderful taste.

Yum, just like "Alice Springs Chicken", which is a favorite dish of mine from Outback Steakhouse. I've made this several times and I always really enjoy it, though I use a different honey mustard recipe that I found on this site (personal preference). This isn't something you can eat every day because it's so fattening, but it's definitely great for a special occasion. I usually serve it with steamed veggies.

As someone who hails from "Downunder" let me set the record straight. Much like that Australian themed restaurant that serves only American food, the only thing "Aussie" about this chicken is the name. Honey-mustard is not a common or even remotely popular flavour in Australia. Having said this...the honey-mustard sauce wasn't too bad but the combination of this sauce, bacon, cheese and mushrooms wasn't a good mix. Hubby said it was ok and that he would probably eat it again but my son refused to touch it which automatically loses a star in my book. I don't think we'll be trying this again.

This recipe sounded wonderful but, I wasn't very impressed with it. The flavors just didn't meld well. This entree left you with that icky heavy feeling after eating it. My husband agreed with me and my son was suspicious of it from the get go. Wouldn't make it again.

This is a great recipe.  My family loved it.  The only thing I would change is to put the cheese on in the last 10 minutes.  It seemed to just totally melt away putting it on at the start of cooking.

My boyfriend LOVES this meal. If it were up to him we would eat this eery night. haha. I actually skipped the homemade honey mustard sauce though for the sake of saving time and used O'Charleys brand honey mustard. It works just as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I haven't had a recipe like this in a long time!!  I used Dijon mustard, and sauted the mushrooms in olive oil and minced garlic.  It was absolutely divine!  My husband loved it!  Thank you!  Definatly a keeper!

Everyone enjoyed this. I made it exactly as the directions stated and it came out very well but I agree with another reviewer that you should just taste the honey mustard as you make it because although it was fine I think it would have also been good a little less sweet.

Once again I have stumbled across an absolutely wonderful recipe. I changed things up a bit, but the honey mustard sauce was the same. I used turkey breast, cutting it into 5 pieces. It almost tasted like chicken and definitely looked like it, but was more tender and juicy. I sauted a little garlic and onion with the turkey in olive oil. I used the grease left from the bacon, mixed with butter to saute the mushrooms. Also, I did use cream honey instead of the regular kind, and a  mild mustard. Topped everything with Swiss and Gouda cheese. This meal was to die for, serving with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed butter broccoli. Thanks a bunch!

Amazing!  This is a great recipe.  My husband used to work at Outback and it met his approval!  I kept the same ingredients, but made a few preparation changes.  I used chicken breast tenders to shorten cooking time.  I followed others advice concerning the bacon grease.  First, cook the bacon.  Then saute the mushrooms in the bacon grease.  Then I set the mushrooms on paper towels to drain and cooked the chicken in the remaining grease.  This adds a lot of flavor and uses only one skillet!  I had very little clean up, which others complained about.  I also mixed the honey mustard ahead of time. (Make sure you whisk it!)  When I was ready to bake it took no time and little clean up!

It was good. I served the chicken on some spaghetti with the extra sauce, but my chicken, though good, hardly tasted of mustard. Would recommend baking the chicken with more sauce. And I find that the cheese is a little too much.

I didn't really care for this much - the restaurants definitely do it better. And none of us like the honey mustard sauce. It was alright, but nothing I'll be making again.

This is now may favorite recipe of all times. Soooo delicious. I can't wait to make it again. The honey mustard sauce is the best. I made the sauce to go with chicken tenders a few weeks ago without making the chicken. I finally decided to give the Aussie chicken a try, and I'm glad I did. Thanks for a great meal.

Since I'm an Aussie and had never heard of this chicken dish, I couldn't wait to make it.  One small problem though Monterey Jack cheese is not available in Australia, so i substituted it with a tasty cheese.  The honey mustard sauce was wonderful, will make this again.

My fiancee actually made this dish.  I think he used honey mustard instead of regular.  The extra dipping sauce is a must.  The bacon gets a little welldone by baking it in the oven already cooked.

Enjoyable dish, my husband loved it.  It wasn't difficult to make, despite the fact I ran into problems.  For some reason, even though I pounded the chicken breasts they thickened up when I browned them, so the cooking time was longer than 15 mins, more like 30 mins. and even then they were still somewhat pink in the thicker parts, so into the microwave they went, resulting in cheese that hardened upon cooling,grrrrrr. I will attempt this again though because the sauce is divine and the ingredients all work together nicely.
UPDATE: I've made this several times since the review. It's a family favourite and great company dish, 
highly recommended .

The sauce was not good at all. May be I didn't use the right mustard? I really can't understand why this recipe is in the hall of fame.

I loved this receipe. It had a wonderful taste except that it was a little sweet so the second time I made it I cut the honey and corn syrup in half and added real chopped onion instead of dried. Every one loved it. Except for the fact that there is allot of clean up with the sauteeing of the chicken, bacon and baking I still would make this dish.

Great dish.  You must use dijon...makes a huge difference.  Also I recommend sauteeing the mushrooms and chicken in the bacon grease, as one user has mentioned before.  Wonderful dish.  Will make again and again.

This was pretty good. My husband liked it more than I did but will make again. Followed recipe pretty closely except, like others, browned mushrooms and chicken in bacon grease. Also do not care for yellow mustard so used dijon which made the dipping sauce delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent. Though I did heed other reviews regarding the amount of mustard. I added mustard a little at a time and ended up using about 1/4 cup plus a little. I also crumbled the bacon.

was terrific tasting. A different reviewer substituted pre-made honey mustard instead of making it fresh...while this is a great idea when time is an issue, the made-from-scratch version is worth the extra effort!  while making it, i felt 2 cups of cheese would be heart stopping (literally), but it seemed to be a good amount after all.

I was not prepared for this to be so amazing.  It was so rich, make sure your chicken is cut into small portions,  no bigger than a deck of cards, and serve with some vegtables and maybe some salad as sides.  The taste was amazing, I used dijon mustard and no onion flakes, other than that i did what i was told. My boyfriend loved it, and i think I will make it again for a special occasion, but it's not very healthy so it won't become a regular.  I think this recipe would modify into a really great  appetizer with cubed chicken wraped in the bacon with a mushroom cap on a toothpick cooked in the oven with the sauce and cheese.

This was fabulous! It was a huge hit with my family. My husband, who has a reputation for being a strictly beef and potatoe man, enjoyed this and was telling other family members about the dish and how good it was. The recipe is very simple. Most of the ingredients are ones that everyone usually has on hand. I microwaved the bacon instead of pan frying, and as other reviewers did, browned the chicken and mushrooms in the bacon grease. I also added some garlic to the mushrooms. Prep and cook time were pretty short which was a bonus. I doubled the recipe so there were leftovers. The leftoevers were even better the next day. A really terrific dish. I will definitely fix again.

Yum!  I have not always had good luck with the highly rated recipes on this site, but this one is great!  My husband and I neither one like mushrooms so I left those out.  Excellent!  Give it a try for sure.  We will be using it frequently.

I have made this recipe twice now and everyone loves it.  This last time I used chopped green onions instead of parsley.  It was still wonderful.  I also bought pre cooked bacon to save time and mess.  All you do is heat it up in the microwave and it still has the same great taste.

I've made this before and loved it, but we are on Atkins now, so I had to tweak the sauce to make it Atkins-friendly (no sugar, so the honey and corn syrup were out).  I just made a faux honey mustard sauce.  I mixed about 1/4 Cup Canola oil, 1/4 yellow mustard and 3 packets of Splenda.  Voila!  The recipe is great for Atkins dieters (we're still on the induction phase and it's perfect).  Yummy yummy!  I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease and I sauteed the shrooms in the grease for a couple of minutes because I used fairly small breasts and they didn't take long to cook.

I had such hight hopes for this recipe but was sadly disappointed.     I was surprised.   I enjoy mustard but found the flavor overpowering in this dish.  The chicken was tender - cooked just right but I'm afraid that's the only positive I can offer. :)

I absolutely love Outback's version of this and was so excited to find this recipe. I was rather disappointed however. Perhaps this would be better if you marinated overnight before cooking. I think I'll stick to wrapping my chicken in dried beef and bacon until I find a better recipe.

Very delicious!  Next time, I would probably use a little less mustard in the sauce.

I made this and LOVED it! I got Raves from my mother and brother also! I did marinate the chicken in Itailian dressing for 30 minutes. I only had 1/4 cup of honey, so I added 3/4 cup honey mustard (O'Charleys Brand)in place of the honey and prepared mustard. I did not have onion flakes, so I added minced garlic. I also added a whole pound of bacon, (we like extra bacon!). I WILL make this again!

This is a excellent  recipe!!!!. It taste just like the chicken from the 
"well known resturant".  I did drain the bacon and put it on paper towels to remove unwanted grease.  I felt it was very easy and good enough for company.

Yummy!  Very, very good.  I didn't have any parsley, so I left that out, and I did drain the bacon grease, but left the little browned bits of heaven in the bottom of the pan and added the oil to that to saute the chicken with.  My husband says that this one is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!!  I compounded the ingredients to make 12 servings and it was fabulous.  I think I pounded the chicken a little too thin because it seemed a bit dry to me, but my family was quick to disagree.  Next time I will leave the meat a little thicker.  Half way through my preparations I wondered if I should have tried it myself before serving it to such a large crowd but this dish definitely did not disappoint!!!!  Try it, you'll be glad you did!

My family loved this one.  I used mozzarella cheese only and doubled the mushrooms.  Also, I was out of honey, so I just used a bit more corn syrup and less mustard, and it turned out great still (just not so sweet I imagine).

This is the best recipe for chicken. It is awesome! I did some changes as suggested. I cut the mustard to 1/4 cup and used half yellow & half dijonn mustard. Also i fried the chicken in bacon grease as well as the mushrooms & onions. I used fresh onion and didn't put it in sause put on top with mushrooms. Then I heated left over sauce in same pan as chicken and mushrooms got all the little pieces off bottom of pan. More flavor. We had company over big hit. Will make again and again.

Man this stuff is good.  The way the colby/jack melts around the chicken is complimentary of its exquisite union with honey mustard dressing.

Very good! I am not quite sure that the toppings and sauce went together as far as our tastes go. (Bacon, cheese, mushrooms + honey mustard) That's probably just us, though.  We still enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

this recipe is great.I think you can cut the honey mustard sauce in half though,there is no need to dip the chicken, there is plenty of sauce on the chicken out of the oven.

My Husband & I loved this recipe...cut down the salt alot added worcestershire sauce.... and fried the chicken in bacon drippings and diced onion..mushrooms. I also glaze the chicken with sauce twice and bake 10 min. before adding the toppings. Then finished the baking time.. EXL.. served with remaining sauce, for dipping...

If I could give this 6 stars I would!!  This recipe is well worth the effort.  I took the advice of a few other reviews and let the chicken marinate for about 45 min in a worcestershire sauce and some minced garlic.  I also omitted the oil, instead I sauted the mushrooms and onions in the bacon grease then seared the chicken in the same pan. (i only make this about once every 3 months as it is VERY high in fat) everything else I follow to a T.  A keeper for sure!

Made this over the weekend.  AWESOME!  Great sauce and better than my chicken marsala.  Only changes I made were to cut the mustard to 1/4 cup and cutting back on the seasoned salt.  I also sauted' the mushrooms prior to placing on the chicken.  My wife raved about the meal and it was a big hit with the inlaws.  Best chicken for a long time.

If you like mustard you will love this.  It has a very strong mustard taste.  Otherwise it is great.  I think next time I will use dijon mustard instead of yellow.

This was pretty good although it tasted nothing like Outback. The sauce was not good at all. I would say it's average.

Best chicken I have ever tasted! A bit time consuming to make but well worth it. The flavors blend wonderfully and the chicken gets a bit crisp on the edges - my mouth waters just thinking about it! Every single person who tasted this loved it - even those who don't like honey-mustard.

This is a great recipe but the mustard is a little overwhelming.  I also did not have any corn syrup so I added a a little more honey.  It is a great recipe I will just use less mustard next time.  Thanks!

YUM YUM YUM! I made this for dinner last night and it was great! The honey mustard was really mustardy, and next time I will use less than a 1/2 cup, but other than that it was soo good. You should try this!!

I've made this a few times and it is soo good.  It is very rich but absolutely delicious.  I serve this in Tahoe after a day of skiing and it suits us perfectly.  I've tried swiss cheese as well which is also very good.

Pretty close to the "other" recipe. My husband enjoyed it more than I did.

Although I am sure this recipe is a heart-attack in waiting, what really good food isn't?  This came out DELICIOUS and my husband and I both can't wait to have it again.

Thanks for sharing Rebecca!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews. I used just a little bit of salt and pepper instead of seasoning salt. Then I sauteed baby portabella mushrooms in the olive oil that I used to sear the chicken. And on the sauce I used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard, left out the syrup and reduced the honey to 1/4 cup. It came out perfect! My husband and my kids all loved it.

If you like Outback's Alice Springs Chicken, you'll love this. Just make sure not to overcook the chicken. We had way too much sauce leftover is my only complaint. I also added some chicken seasoning to the breasts for added flavor before I cooked them.

This was one of those dishes that involved a lot of prep work, but was delicious.  The ends definitely justified the means.  I didn't quite have enough mustard, so I added some dijonaise to make up the difference, I also omitted corn syrup and it was delicious.  One last difference, I sauteed mushrooms and also onions, and everyone loved it.  Serve with Philly Mashed Potatoes, also found on this site.

This recipe was yummy! I used packaged cooked bacon from the refrig. isle in the grocery store which made it easier and less time consuming.  I will make this one again.

AWESOME recipe!  The chicken was juicy, and the sauce - YUM!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and saved out some of the sauce to use as salad dressing (good idea!).  Oh, and we didn't think this was salty at all.  Thank you SO much!

My husband loved this one.  I thought it was a little sweet so next time, I'd leave out the corn syrup.  I'm not much of a mustard lover, but it was not overwhelming . . . a nice change of pace.

Yum! This was really good, especially with the extra sauce on the side. (It has a really rich flavor, however, and I don't think I could eat it very often.) I omitted the mushrooms, as my family doesn't like them, but it still tasted great. The husband and kids wolfed it down.

This recipe was very good.  I agree that the color was rather scary, but the flavor was fabulous.  I didn't use the corn syrup, and should have cut the sauce by 1/2.  I made rice and served with fresh green beans.  I will use this receipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

Pow-Zang-WOW!  This chicken is ultimately awesome.  The color of the sauce frightened me a little bit.  Perhaps next time, I will use dijon mustard.  I also forgot to put the sauce on the chicken BEFORE all the rest of the toppings, so I just ended up scooping it into the pan, all around the chicken pieces.  Tasted great!  Husband loves anything with bacon, but isn't too fond of "sweet with meat".  This was a hit with him!  Must try, at least once!

I RECENTLY HAD A VOLUNTEER LUNCHEON AND USE THIS RECIPE
I SERVED 75 GUEST/IT WAS WONDERFUL. EVERYONE IS ASKING
FOR THE RECIPE. I MAY ADD THIS TO MY MENU AT THE NURSING
HOME. IT SURE HAS ENOUGH CALORIES. THE RECIPE DIDN'T TELL
HOW MANY OZ. OR MEAT. I USED A 6 0Z CHICKEN BREAST.
           GREAT RECIPE

This was pretty tastey but so full of fat.  The best part was the sauce.  I used Kopps Arizona Heat mustard and the honey.  I also use just a little Gourmayo Chipotle mayo.  The combination was good and my hubby raved about it.  It's got a little kick to it.

This was o.k.  I'm not all that fond of honey mustard, so I only gave a 3 star.  I am very glad I tried the sauce before adding the corn syrup.  I didn't add it, it would have been WAY too sweet with it.  I didn't pound the chicken, just baked it longer.  All around, not bad, if you like honey mustard sauce.  I, however, won't be making it again...

Totally "Delish"  My husband daughter and son liked it very much.  I'm not a bacon/cheese eater, so I only tasted a bit of the chicken (minus all of the embellishments) just to try it out.  I thought it was quite tasty and plan to make it when we get company!  Great Recipe!!

very good chicken recipe, even my 12 year old son loved it.  The Honey Mustard Sauce is also great to make up alone as a dipping sauce for chicken fingers, soft pretzels, etc.

This is the first time reviewing a recipe from here, but this was excellent.  I omited the dried onion flakes and instead I added some sliced onions while I sauteed the mushroooms.  (We both love onions in anything)  My husband said it may have been too much bacon on his, so next time I will put the extra slice on mine, because I loved it.  We ate this several days ago, and already he is asking for it again.  This dinner will definatly be around in our home for a long time!!!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I am always trying recipes off this site & wanted something new to take to a church supper. I made this & it was wonderful! Everyone wanted the recipe! We did cut the chicken up a little though so they would be able to serve it easier through the buffet line. This is definetely a keeper!

This was very good and you'll love it if you like honey mustard. I used turkey bacon and more cheese.

Made this for my girl-friend this weekend, she LOVED it.  Will definitely make again soon.  Would prolly do just a tad better with crumbled bacon and sauteing of the mushrooms.  Still an awesome recipe.

Outstanding! I used Dijon mustard, and I also drained the bacon fat from the pan and then cooked the chicken in the same pan to minimize clean-up.  My husband and kids loved it!

Chicken tasted very good.  I thought that the inside would taste more garlicky.  I think next time I will stuff the chicken with some garlic as well. A light sauce would also be good with this.

The honey mustard sauce is awesome! This tasted just like Outback. I used white sharp cheddar instead and it turned out great. I will make this over and over (if I can afford the calories and fat).

This was a great recipe!  My 9 yr old daughter helped me make this very easy recipe.  We all loved it!  This one is definitely a keeper.  I didn't pound the chicken and it still came out very juicy and wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing it!!

This is the best chicken recipe I've found on
this site. I used the chicken tenders to
shorten the cooking time and I plan to add green
onions next time I prepare it. Which will be soon!

This was great.  My husband said that the Honey Mustard sauce wasn't exactly what he expected but he had very high expectations and it may have been the type of mustard we used. The chicken was awesome and easy.

I made this chicken dish for 16 and everyone loved it.  The only thing I would change with a quadrupled recipe would be the amount of liquid.  I had at least a third or a half more of the honey mustard than I needed.

I do not like mayo or mustard so decreased the amount of mustard and did not put in the mayo.  My husband and I enjoyed this but my kids would not try it (usually for them).  I will definite make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

FINALLY!!  I have loved this chicken for years and now I can make it (and save money haha).  If you don't want to take the time to cook the bacon, hormel and some other brands now have bacon that's precooked-all you do is nuke it!  Thank you for this recipe!!

I thought the recipe went together easily. It was not as complicated as I first thought. It was a hit with my friends and I enjoyed it also. The honey mustard recipe was great, and could be used for other dishes as well.

My husband said that he loved the dish, it caused an explosion of his taste buds.  Fortunately I made enough for his lunch tomorrow too.  I went ahead and browned the chicken in the bacon grease.  This looked really great on the plate too.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe, very tasty.  My husband did not like it though, he doesn't like mustard and the honey mustard sauce was very noticable.  I may try this again and cut way back on the sauce, or try to disguise it better. I also omitted the corn syrup, that just didn't sound good to me..way too sweet.

I didn't find this recipe very time consuming!  It was easy and VERY delicious!  It was good enough that my daughter ate it and wanted seconds!  She's not a big cheese eater either!  I didn't have onion flakes, so I used garlic powder and it came out wonderful!  I also used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 regular mustard.  I didn't have light corn syrup only dark and it turned out wonderful!  Thanks for such a great recipe!  Will definitely make this one again!

I don't even like honey mustard and I love this.  The chicken is tender and it tastes great.  Everyone loves this recipe and I make it when we have company.  YUM YUM YUM!!!

YUM YUM! Another recipe my picky husband gave the thumbs up to make again. That doesn't happen very often, and I am always trying to find meals he actually likes. The cheese did get a little sticky and hardened as it cooled of so my suggestion is to serve immediately while still hot.

Mmmm mmm, so very good!  Perfect as is, it makes a delicious honey mustard sauce.  I used turkey bacon which has a chewier texture but way less fat than regular bacon.

I made this tonight and everyone loved it.  I forgot to buy the mushrooms so used canned mushrooms.  I also used pepper monterey jack cheese since we like spicy foods and only used 1 cup which was plenty.  I cooked my bacon in the electric skillet, drained off the grease reserving about 1 Tbsp. and sauteed the chicken in this rather than the vegetable oil.  Probably isn't as healthy but it sure was delicious.  This will definitely go in my recipe book of personal favorites!

Wonderful!  Everyone loved it and have already asked for it again.  I took someone else's advice and marinated the chicken in Worchestershire sauce overnight after punching holes in it.  That got the flavor and juices flowing throughout!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  It yields an abundance of honey mustard sauce, other than that it's fantastic.  This is one of the best of chicken meals I have found.

My husband really doesn't care for honey-mustard & about had a cow when he smelled this cooking.  However, the finished product had a very light honey-mustard flavor, which was great for him.  I liked it both as is & with additional sauce on the side.

I was a little worried, my spouse does not like mustard. But while I was preparing the meal, I had already made the honey mustard sauce and was preparing another part. I looked over and my spouse was eating the sauce with his crackers!! He had no idea what was in it but he knew he loved it!!! It was awesome, now I need to go to that well known Australian resturaunt to have that dish to compare! Thanks again!!

I kind of combined this recipe and the Alice Chicken recipe.I used the salt and worchestershire sauce and soaked the chicken overnight.I used the amount of mushrooms,bacon and cheese from the Alice chicken and the Honey Mustard recipe and cooking method from the Aussie Chicken.My whole family loved it~even my very picky 5 year old!Fantastic!

Very Nice!!!  I'm not a big honey mustard fan, and I really liked this recipe.  The 12 year old was less than enthusiastic, but she's a 12 year old.   Well received by the rest of the family.

This was a hit and so simple to make.  I threw the mushrooms in the pan I cooked the chicken in after removing the chicken, which added a nice flavor.  The mushrooms are not overwherlming, nor is the sauce.  The flavors compliment eachother and blend well. Easy enough for the novice cooks...and a nice break for the more experienced cooks.

My husband who HATES chicken breasts, loved this dish.  My kids loved it the first time, the second time I made it my teenager suddenly claimed to hate it (she noticed it had a honey mustard sauce on it, oh well!)  I found I had so much sauce left over I just put half on and chill the rest for another use.  I honestly think this "home made" version of the famous restaurant dish is much better and too easy to make at home, I think we will be saving a lot of $$ by not going out :-)

My entire family LOVED this recipe.  My son, who is sometimes unforgiveably picky, even loved it. It was definitely an "empty plate club" gathering with this great dish.

Wow!  This was yummy.  It took a while to fix, but it wasn't hard.  This one is going in my recipe collection -- I might have to laminate this one.  Ha.  This one was better than the Outback (theirs was way too salty).  Highly recommended, and will make again..and again...and again.

This was the best.  Tasted just like the restraunt version.  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter first, and I did 1/2 the honey mustard sauce recipe.  Absolutely wonderful!

I followed other reviewers advice and sauteed the mushrooms in red wine and butter before topping the chicken breasts. Also, used no fat miracle whip and turkey bacon and cut the cheese to less than 1/2 recipe called for. Because everyone said how much extra sauce it makes, I actually cooked 6 chicken breasts with the same recipe. All the guests loved it!

This was great!  I made the sauce just as directed, but didn't have any mushrooms and only had cheddar cheese on hand.  It still turned out delicious.  I will make this one again for sure.

This was delicious!  The whole family liked it, even my four-year old nephew (once the mushrooms were gone!).  I tried to lighten it up a bit, and it was still a huge success.  I used less cheese (I shredded a reduced fat version) and only four slices of low-sodium bacon (center cut-less fat).  I also substituted fat-free, plain yogurt for the mayo...no one even noticed and they were dumping the sauce on their veggies!  All in all, a marvelous recipe that's quite adaptable, too!  Great!

This dish tasted just like the restaurant's and my husband just LOVED it!!!  Very rich...definitely not good for people on a diet...but, well worth the calories.  This will be a permanent fixture on our family menu.

I am vegetarian, but I made this for my husband and some dinner guests.  They LOVED
it.  I got lot's of compliments.  It is a good recipe - I don't eat chicken, so when I prepare
meat dishes for others I have to trust the recipe and can't taste it.  Well according to the 
compliments it is a winner.

YUM! Not only am I not that fond of chicken (I'm the only one in the family though), but I'm not very fond of honey or mustard either...this was very tasty though. It was quick to prepare (and some of it could be done in advance, which I LOVE)and tasted very good. A friend of mine is having a baby soon and I think I'm going to make it for them. Who wouldn't like this?! And it presents very nicely. I think that 'broccoli bites' (with this recipes sauce) would go well with this.

My husband loved this dish.  The homemade honey mustard sauce was delicious, and I used the leftover sauce for a variety of other things like chicken nugget dipping sauce for my daughter or salad dressing.

This is a fantastic recipe.My kids aren't  into chicken, but they loved this dish. I crumbled my bacon instead of leaving it in big pieces. This helped topping stay on top when cutting to eat.

This was wonderful. I have a family of 6, and very rarely am I able to find something that pleases all of them. This is one that honestly did. A winner and a keeper. I read some of the other reviews, and this was not a time consuming recipe. It was very easy and simple to make. Also did as suggested, and left out the corn syrup.

This is a good chicken recipe!  Make sure and offer the extra sauce because alot of the sauce put on before cooking seems to not stick to the chicken while cooking.  My husband really liked it as well as the teenagers in our home...the two small children did not like it at all.

The recipe is excellent though the preparation is more complicated than it needs to be. I use one oven-proof pan to cook the bacon, brown the chicken, the quickly cover it with the sauce and cheese and toss it in the oven. MUCH easier and a whole lot less dishes to do. Also, using a handheld blender on the sauce makes it much smoother and improves the flavor.

i don't know how often i'll make this, maybe my problem was making too much (i doubled the recipe).  i liked it -- but -- i think this may be a little on the cheesy side.  i don't think reducing the cheese would be a bad idea.  i agree with other reviewers that the honey mustard sauce is delish...  and who can't love a recipe with bacon.  i did what another reviewer suggested and sauted the mushrooms.  i'm glad i did.

This recipe was great.  I used the lowfat chicken breasts with centercut bacon (Lower in fat) and mozz with light cheddar mixed for the cheese and since I live in Cleveland...we used Stadium mustard instead of yellow mustard!  Gave a little zing to the sauce!  We loved this one!

This was wonderful!!  Made this for my husband, father, and brother.  I made something different for my 4 kids, thinking they would not eat this.  Well, was I surprised.  The kids food was untouched, and I found m 41 yar old brother fighting with the 6 year old for the last piece of chicken!!!  I did not think it time consuming at all.  You get out what you put in.  Time well spent and well rewarded...will make often.  THANK YOU!!!

Whenever my boyfriend and his buddies go out playing on their four wheelers for the day I try to cook them a delicious meal when they come home. They ususally become my personal guinea pigs before I serve a dish to family. They all loved this!!! I wish I had made enough for seconds for the hungry fella's!!  I don't know why people complain about the time it takes- I didn't find it that time consuming. I made a slight mistake and cooked the bacon before I put it on the breast, but I am sure I will do the same thing again. It was as much of a hit around here as this great site is!!! Thanks!

Another satisfied customer here.  My husband, toddler son and I all enjoyed it.  Although it seemed pretty time-consuming when I read the directions, it went together really easily.  I made a few small changes.  I used a good bottled honey dijon dressing and added extra clover honey and some finely minced vidalia onion.  I also sprinkled the chicken with Spike rather than a seasoned salt.  I used some of the bacon grease in a nonstick skillet rather than oil to brown the chicken breasts.  MMMMM!  The chicken was very tender, which is not easy to acheive with boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  Thanks for a winner.

Good recipe, but I found that there was many things that I would do different if I made it again.  Such as: pre-cook the mushrooms so the sauce stays thicker, and use curry powder to add more flavor.  Overall good recipe

I had always loved the restaurant-version of this recipe so I decided to try this recipe.  I couldn't believe how good and easy it was!  This recipe also works really well on the grill.

Very good!  I used creole mustard to add a bit of zing to it.  I think next time, I'll reserve a little bit less of the mustard mix tho', and put more on the chicken as it bakes to make it moister.

This recipe is great.  I made it for 2 other adults and one child and everyone loved it.  I thought it took a little bit too much prep time, but it was well worth it.  I will be making it again.

very good! My husband was practically licking the plate because he loved the Honey Mustard so much. I used already sliced mushrooms and the precooked bacon sold in the stores, this really cut the prep time. It was delicious.

I thought the honey mustard sauce was delicious in this recipe!  I am a cheese lover, but there was even a little too much for my taste.  This probably isn't the healthiest recipe as is, but eliminating the bacon and most of the cheese, it would still be delicious!  I tried another honey mustard chicken recipe before that was terrible comared to the taste of this one.

Tasted even better the second day.  We enjoyed several meals (4) I believe, being just the two of us.  Have used the extra Honey Mustard sauce as a salad dressing and added a small amount of lemon zest to the salad greens then added the honey mustard sauce.  MMMMM Good!  Used it for sandwich material also with ham slices.

We really didn't like this. I can't imagine paying for this in a restaurant. Too many different flavors for our palates. Too high in fat. I would never serve this to guests or company.

I thought this was wonderful - As I served it I realized how heart-unhealthy it might be with all of the cheese...but it was yummy and I'll be using the mustard sauce separately to grill, etc.  Made one without mushrooms for my 7 year old, who liked it ... Thanks!

This chicken dish is really good, different and delicious enough to satisfy (and impress) guests.  I made it according to recipe and wasnt disappointed.

Thanks for sharing, very yummy indeed! I omitted the corn syrup, used light Mayo and 2% cheese to reduce overall calories. It still tasted very good!

We are crazy about mushrooms, and with bacon they delightful and a perfect accompaniment to the honey-mustard sauce.  I used uncooked clover honey, and spicy brown mustard along with the mayo, and it was a real knockout.  Yum!!

I did not change any ingredients from the original recipe.  The dish turned out great and we will make this again soon.  Because the chicken is so smothered in sauce and other yummy stuff, you might be able to skip the browning step and bake a little longer.  Thanks for a deliciously different dinner!

I tried this recipe because of it's reviews. I am usually in a rush, and would normally bypass something with this many ingredients, but it was surprisingly simple. I had dinner on the table in less than an hour. It was a hit for the whole family. I followed the suggestion of bypassing the corn syrup, and am glad I did, the sauce was delicious and plenty sweet. The smaller kids could probably do without the mushrooms. Will make again and again.

I made this for the first time when we had friends over for dinner. There were no leftovers. I used bottled honey mustard barbecue sauce and skipped the mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again!

My family absolutely loved this. I did not use the corn syrup (as others suggest). The sauce was delicious! I used a jar on mushrooms instead of fresh. I also used mozzarella since that was the cheese I had on hand. No picture since my family gobbled this.

This is awesome!!! Couple changes I made.....cut the honey down to 1/4 cup and left out the corn syrup.  Still plenty sweet enough.
Definitely making again.

It was very good.  I did not add the corn syrup, halved the cheese (used cheddar and monterey jack), added Worcestershire sauce to mustard sauce.  My wife asked that I make it again in the future.

I think I will omit the seasoning salt next time.   It was too salty, but maybe I used more than I should have.  Otherwise, great recipe. I also fried the chicken in the bacon grease.

Works as a casserole as well. I marinated diced chicken as another reviewer suggested. We precooked the chicken in a skillet. Then layered the chicken, sauce, bacon crumbles and cheese. You could easily add noodles or veggies before baking as well.

Made this and family loved it. Perfect taste to honey mustard sauce. Only change I made was I kept the bacon drippings for when I had to pan fry the breasts prior to the oven. Perfect!

It was very good but my chicken breasts were very large .... I served it with risotto and asparagus. Next time I will use smaller chicken breasts because they overwhelmed my sides.

Absolutely delicious! I modified a bit for two people - only used two chicken breasts and didn't halve, but did pound until 1/2 in. thickness. We bought marinated breasts from Wegmans that were brown sugar flavored, which paired well with the rest of the ingredients. I used half the amount of the rest of the ingredients, and didn't add corn syrup as I felt the honey would bring enough sweetness. It was perfect. Next time I'll chop the mushrooms into smaller pieces before spreading on top. Will be making again!

Made this for dinner guests & it was a great hit. I did not have any dried minced onions, so I used chives. I also forgot to put the parsley on before serving. Everyone loved it.

I eliminated the vegetable oil and just cooked the chicken in the bacon grease, but otherwise made no changes. We're not huge honey mustard fans, but we both devoured this chicken. Amazing recipe.

Did not salt before hand. It pulls out the moisture from meat. Cook chicken to the temp.of 165* anything more too tuff.

Almost identical to the Alice Springs Chicken and my family loved it.  Will make again.  I just omitted the corn syrup (I don't keep it on hand) and it was perfect sweetness with just the honey.

05/02/18: Made first time, per directions: Had barely just enough  ingredients; dijon mustard edged over the honey / mayo; despite that, I could imagine how 5 star this recipe is. You don't need the veggie oil or corn syurp.  DOUBLE THE SAUCE and use REAL finely minced onion.  Cook bacon first; use the grease to saute mushrooms, additional minced onion AND chicken breasts. Will update when I make again using proper ingredient amounts.

Made the recipe more less as written. Used onion powder instead of onion flakes and extra honey instead of corn syrup. I did as many reviewers suggested and cooked the bacon in a frypan, took out all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat and cooked the mushrooms,  I added the extra seasonings one reviewer suggested including onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and paprika,  removed the mushrooms, added the extra oil back in, and fried the chicken.   I  cooked it for five minutes on each side in the pan and 15 minutes in the oven and it came out completely cooked. I Can’t imagine cooking it for any more time  as some reviewers suggested.  The key must be pounding the chicken breast to 1/2 inch thick.  Next time I might cover the pan with foil before baking and remove it for just the last minute or two.

This was very good!  I did not have mushrooms on hand, so I sauteed some onion & added a bit of spinach & it was still really good!  (I will do mushrooms next time!) I used the dijon & skipped the corn syrup.  The flavors were very rich.  I will cut the chicken pieces smaller next time.

Made this 2 times. Once as given & once with changes hoping it would taste better. I was very disappointed cause we like everything that is in this recipe.  With most of the ratings so high we kept thinking what did we do wrong, but nothing. Pulling from my recipe box.

I followed the recipe as is. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked but the flavors of the dish weren't anything to write home about. I like all the flavors individually, but together they don't create anything special. I have never tried this dish at any restaurant so I cannot compare. I just know that it was decent enough for one meal but none of my family liked it enough for me to want to make it a 2nd time. One positive take away was it really helped me develop my best version of honey mustard, and for that I am very grateful to the person who posted this.

Made this last night. I cut everything in half for the sauce except for the onion flakes. Also sautéed the mushrooms in fat from bacon and seared chicken in same skillet. 1 pan for everything. 20 mins in the oven. Also used Dijon, will add more next time. Was still a bit sweet tasting. But overall tasted great.

I lightly pounded the chicken to even thickness and browned it in the bacon grease.  My wife and I liked it so much that we are preparing it for guests tomorrow.

First time tried honey mustard chicken from this site. My Aussie husband had no idea why it called Aussie chicken but OMG it was absolutely delicious!! I used Dijon mustard like everyone else did and doubled the mushrooms. Dunno how it would be with prepared mustard but I'll keep using Dijon for my own. I got about 1/2C sauce left after made the dish so used that marinated some sliced chicken breast overnight, grilled without oil, then just simply eat that wrapped in lettuce leaves as we both are on diet, that was good too! Awesome recipe!! Thank you!

Amazing dish and very easy to make! I definitely recommend pounding the chicken a bit flatter prior to cooking. Otherwise, the recommended time might not be enough and you'll be left with that weird, not-quite-cooked texture in the middle.

I used prepared honey mustard to save time and really wish I hadn't. Next time I make it, I'll probably use Dijon, as the mustard is really the flavor of this recipe. And I didn't add corn syrup either. This dish was worth making, and I will make it again.

Followed recipe to a tee using Hy's seasoning salt to marinate.  So salty, the chicken was non-edible.  The honey mustard sauce was very good and will make it again.

Sauce was delicious - without corn syrup and with a little less honey and all Dijon mustard. Chicken was moist. But we didn't feel the finished dish was that great. I'll be using the honey mustard sauce again, though.

Love the basic concept of chicken with mushroom and bacon.  But the mustard was over powering. My bad for listening to someone else's recommendation instead of sticking to original recipe of just regular yellow mustard.  And I agree that it needs some color - I'll add tomato or red pepper next time.

Made I tonight. I always read most reviews before i make any recipe.  First off..if you have a cast iron skillet USE IT.  I used by 12" skillet.  1 pan, 1 mess.  I marinated the chicken breasts in the Worcester sauce, lime juice and minced garlic in the refrigerator all day.  I fried the bacon, set it aside, put mushrooms in, sautéed, took them out and then cooked chicken.  Layered everything in the skillet, added cheese (Didn't use all 2 cups, and we Love cheese.  PERFECT!  If you want to lower the fat content, use turkey bacon.  I also used onion powder, to taste, 1-2 tsp., as it gives it a smooth texture.  Enjoy!

Seriously flavourful. We changed up the onion flakes for real onions and even though we had 2 large chicken breasts we kept the sauce at the same amount.

The only difference when we make it the next time is to add the cheese halfway through baking.

One word, eww.  I followed this recipe almost to the letter.  I left out the mushrooms and I reduced the mustard.  Now, I love mustard, but the quantity given seemed too much.  Even with reducing it still reeked of mustard. It looked awful and tasted horrid.  What a waste of my time, energy, and ingredients.

Tasty. Like other reviewers, I sautéed mushrooms in a little bit of the bacon grease then cooked the chicken in the same cast-iron skillet. Used plain yellow mustard and no corn syrup. This does seem like a good recipe for company, assuming it'll be good after sitting for a little while, since I don't want to be fussing in the kitchen when I have guests.

We did make a couple modifications. For the cheese we used mild cheddar 200 mg grated, and sprinkled bread crumbs on top before going into the oven. We also used fresh mushroom 250 Gr.  sliced and sauted in butter with a clove of garlic and small onion. 
It was excellent and will make again for sure!

Delicious! My husband get saying yum until he finished. I did take the advice of the top reviewer who recommend marinating chicken in Worcester, lime juice and garlic. Did not use he light corn syrup either. Cannot wait to make again for my children and their families. A winner!

It was very good. I made a few changes because our kitchen is being remodeled so I did this entirely on the grill. The butcher cut my chicken breasts in half so they were thinner and easier to cook. I marinated the chicken in buttermilk as recommended by other reviewers. Grilled the chicken with seasoning salt and at the same time sauted the mushrooms with an onion and bacon bits (the bagged bits from Costco) in a foil pan on the grill. Once the onion was softened, I took the chicken from the grill and placed in a foil pan, covered with the honey mustard sauce, layered the mushroom/onion/bacon mixtures and cheese (again followed the suggestion of not too much cheese). Cooked until the cheese was melted and served. It was delicious and no mess! Thanks for the recipe.

When I saw this recipe, I knew I wanted to test it before serving it to company.  Oh, my! It was fabulous.  There were raves all around. The only adjustment I made was to leave out the corn syrup and just use the honey as indicated.  I knew it would be too sweet with the additional ingredient and I used Grey Poupon Country Dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard.
I will definitely serve this to company...easy and fabulous flavor.

Very good recipe. My son only eats chicken, so always looking for recipes he will eat.  My husband never complains and rarely gives praise for meals...he is very easy to please. At this meal he said "very good chicken", then told me again today how much he enjoyed it!  We all decided this recipe is a keeper. I thought I had over cooked it a little and decided I cooked too long in the fry pan; since it took longer to melt the cheese in the oven plus you need to gage the size of the chicken breasts.

Unbelievably and sooo tasty! So easy to make and my husband was in love! The honey Dijon sauce is amazing and not to sweet I did not add the corn syrup which was recommended by other reviews definitely smart it was already sweet! I also used low fat cheese and mayo just to cut down on the fat and it tasted amazing! The recipe used most household staples which made it super convenient. Definitely going to end up being a regular recipe used in our house!

I used extra mushrooms and a ready prepared honey mustard sauce due to time constraints, but it was amazing!  Definitely a recipe that will become a regular in our home.  I used pan fried onions instead of onion flakes too.

When I make this, I use the bacon grease to brown the chicken breasts. As it is written, this is a very tasty and unique dish for chicken. It is easily halved. I rarely use any of the extra sauce- it's plenty saucy on its own!

I made this the other night and modified it according to the other reviews. I didn't use any corn syrup like advised, yet it still came out tasting like candy.

Ok so here's the deal. This tastes delicious, although that is to be expected. Is there anything that doesn't taste delicious when you cover it in bacon, cheese, and honey mustard mayo sauce. The downside of course is that it is really unhealthy and about 30 minutes after I ate it I felt like I was going to die. Bottom line: it taste great but it comes at a price.

Okay, wow.  This should be called 'wow chicken', or 'the Jesus of chicken', or 'my-taste-buds-are-doing-the-cha-cha chicken'. Anything other than Aussie Chicken. NOTHING prepared me for the level of 'WOW' I was about to experience. In fact, there was so much wow that I am sitting here in front of my computer with a plate of chicken (Jesus-chicken gets that honor). If you make this how I made it, you will only be happy. Very, very happy... And full. Probably too full (but totally worth it).

I pounded away at my chicken breasts and marinated them in Worcestershire sauce along with a healthy amount of salt and pepper for probably six hours before cooking. Next time, I'll try to make that  a little longer and maybe add some other spices/garlic (always lots of garlic). 

After marination came making the sauce. We had no onion flakes, so I skipped that, and did everything else as recommended... EXCEPT I used dark corn syrup, and probably a little less than the original recipe entailed. Oh, and I used half dijon mustard/half normal. Even without onion, it turned out great. Bravo, recipe. 

Earlier in the day I had cut bacon into thin slices (I took all six strips and cut them into probably half inch rectangles). After they fully cooked to a nice, flexible texture, I took them out and set them aside. This created a nice bit of bacon grease for me to use to brown up my chicken. I probably fully cooked it in the pan, but chicken is forgiving, and I would rather it be overcooked than u

No modifications.  We found the mustard over powering and the texture unpleasant.

This was delicious, I followed what others said and eliminated the corn syrup, used dijon mustard and cooked the chicken and mushrooms in the bacon grease instead of additional oil. My son couldn't get enough, he loved it.

My husband thought it was ok but I unfortunately thought it was terrible. I like mustard but this was too much.  The salty bacon and tangy mustard didn't go together for me.  The mushrooms, cheese, and chicken were good though.

I honestly won't make this again. I thought it tasted too sweet and I don't like my food tasting sweet unless it's deserts of course. The chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce was good by itself, it kinda reminded me of honey mustard, but needed more tang I thought instead of so much sweetness.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was disgusting. I omitted the corn syrup as other reviews said it was too sweet but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was still way too sweet. No one in my family liked it and I ended up having to order a pizza instead. Sadly, I had made double for dinner tomorrow but will have to make something else.

This was a good recipe, something to change the normal chicken routine. I changed it just a little because I have a large family so I took 6 breasts and cut them in half to make 12 flatter breasts. This caused me to cut down the cook time on the chicken (frying & baking). I used mild cheddar cheese because that's what I had. I followed the video sauce recipe by substituting more honey instead of corn syrup but it came out a bit too sweet for my taste so I added a bit more mayo and mustard.  I served it with green beans and garlic bread.

My family loved it, especially the babies. I will definitely do this again.

Absolutely superb! I've made this twice now and it gets better every time. For the honey mustard I only use mayo, honey and spicy brown mustard (guldens).  Everything else stays true to the recipe. Have multiple requests to make this again and again

I read the other comments about subsisting the corn syrup, absolutely right do not use corn syrup just add extra honey, I actually used spicy mustered for a kick.

I made this for the first time today. I followed the directions almost to the T but I did omit the corn syrup and I added some tomatoes to the sauteed mushrooms. Cooked the bacon then sauteed the mushrooms and tomatoes in the same pan without adding any additional oil. Once those were done I cooked the chicken in the same pan but I had to add a little additional oil before they were finished. I've never had the restaurant version but this is super easy to make and very delicious!

The recipe turn out good. I ended up having to leave it in the oven for 30-40 minutes because the chicken was still pink. This destroyed all the flavours. Next time I will brown it longer making sure it is almost cooked.

This is amazing, I didn't have corn syrup, but it didn't seem to matter too much. We like our sauces warm, so I put all of the sauce over and around the chicken.  Definitely a household staple from now on!

It was just ok.  It would actually probably make a great sandwich on some crusty bread.  I used thin cut chicken breast halves for convenience.  After flash browning, I cooked everything in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes.  Anything longer would make for inedible chicken leather patties.  This could probably be finished easily in the same skillet on the stove top with the lid on for the last 10 minutes.  Did not use the the additional sauce.  It did not need it.

I made this for a girl on our first date. It was my first time cooking for someone like that. It turns out delicious and she is now my girlfriend. I seared it in a Teflon coated cast iron skillet which I then used to bake in. It think the skillet added to its tenderness. I have this in my recipe box for another time

This was pretty tasty. I used turkey bacon cooked in a skillet with a little butter to cut down on some of the fat and it still tasted yummy. I also followed the tip of marinating in worcestershire sauce, lime juice, and garlic, as well as sautéing the mushrooms. I didn't use any corn syrup, I just used honey, yellow mustard, ground mustard, and low fat mayo. I always make extra for leftovers, but they won't last long.

Seems like the kind of dish you'd get in a rowdy pub. Make sure not to overcook the chicken. It is so tasty, we loved it! Yes, I would serve it again in a heartbeat.

Excellent with one exception.  Use 1/2 the honey mustard sauce and do not reserve any for dressing after cooking the chicken.  The "raw" dressing is unappealing and overpowering. Otherwise a home run.

Awesome! Anytime I'm missing a few ingredients I read through the reviews for ideas. This time I was missing the mushrooms, honey and italian seasoning. I did have Billy Bee's honey mustard, worcestershire sauce, garlic and lime juice. I only had about 15 mins to marinate the chicken and it still ended up nice and juicy.Maybe it helped that I pounded the chicken in the marinade. I also followed other's suggestions and grilled the chicken in the bacon fat before cooking it in the oven.Oh, and since I didn't do the mushrooms, I topped the chicken with minced onion and some paprika while frying it.There just didn't seem to be enough sauce, so after frying the chicken, I drained most of the bacon fat..leaving about a tblspn of fat and all the dried up bits of onion and chicken. To this I added about a cup of half and half, about two tsp. of honey mustard, a few good shakes of worcestershire and a few shakes of paprika. Heated on low, it thickened up on its own. My daughter hates sauce as a rule..but she liked this...oh and she doesn't like mustard either..I'm not sure on my measurements for the sauce as I'm totally an eyeballer. I imagine the mushrooms add another level of flavour, but this dish is yummy even without.

I added chopped green onions over the top about 5 mins before it was done. I also used garlic and herb seasoning by Mrs. Dash to season the chicken before browning it.

For the honey mustard, I skipped the corn syrup and used Dijon mustard. Other than that, I made the recipe as is and it came out amazing. I will definitely make it again. I paired it with a simple salad. Next time I might try it as a sandwich on Portuguese rolls.

Great recipe!  I did not have honey or honey mustard.  So I used dijon mustard- 1/3 cup- and also added some brown sugar - 3T- as I did not have enough syrup either.  I used about some syrup too.  I used the bacon grease to cook the chicken and mushrooms.  I cooked the chicken for 15 min without cheese then another 10 with cheese- perfect!  I also did not have time to refrigerate the chicken with seasoning salt for 30 so I only let it sit while I made the sauce.

Great Recipe!  I know that I made this years ago, but could not find a trace of it in my Recipe Box.  I perused the comments and omitted the corn syrup.  Also I liked the idea of using one pan as one comment suggested. So I sautéed the mushrooms, then took them out with a slotted spoon, cooked the bacon, and removed and then browned the chicken in the same pan, no need to add additional oil.  Everyone loved it, we'll be making it again! Thank you!

I've been making this recipe for years, and absolutely love it. Prep time is a little longer but if you have the time I HIGHLY recommend it! The only changes I made was to use dijon mustard or course ground mustard and omitted the corn syrup. I pounded the breasts and seasoned with salt and pepper before frying. I also omitted the mushrooms because I am not a fan, but i'm sure if you are a mushroom fan I'm sure it would compliment the dish. Thanks again for sharing!!

I made this the other night when we had a friend over. Hubby, his friend and my two year old all gave it a thumbs up, but only after they finished eating. I did as others suggested and sautéed the mushrooms and I fried everything up in a cast iron skillet.

Very easy to make and tastes wonderfully!  I used Dijon mustard and did not use corn syrup as others suggested to omit.  Will make again for sure.  Thank you
1-18'  Made again but with regular mustard and corn syrup.  Very good still.  Since benign ways w good I will omit the corn syrup in the future.

Big hit at our house! Even with picky eaters. And I didn't even have the mushrooms or fresh parsley.

This is really good chicken. I didn't have season salt so I used Big Fat Jerry´s Brand X seasoning which we use on everything. I halved the sauce and just cooked the chicken in it with the bacon and cheese (didn't have mushrooms).  I've never had the Alice Springs Chicken at OB so I can't say if it's similar, but I do like this one.

I made this as written despite some people mentioning the amount of mustard which did make me nervous at first. Thoroughly enjoyed this and leftovers warmed up great.

Yum! Didn't really feel like i needed the sauce on the side, it was already so flavorful! Cooked in the oven for 30 min like some suggested, but wish I'd gone with the recipe's direction of 15, because it came out a little tough and dry.  Didn't use corn syrup.

I have been a little hesitant to make this recipe the last month, and now I feel very foolish. I made the small change by omitting the colby-jack Monterey cheese, as I feel cheese usually either makes or breaks a dish for me. That being said, the honey and mustard sauce was phenomenal, and I thought it was clever. I thought the smell from the mustard was overpowering when making it, but after tasting the sauce, my mind was blown. Tasted sweet and savory, and worked perfectly with the chicken. The bacon added a nice crunchiness to the chicken being so tender. Sautéed mushrooms always goes extremely well with chicken in my opinion. And I sautéed some seasoned asparagus in vegetable oil. I also omitted the corn starch, and added extra honey. Spectacular dish, and I will make it over and over again! Thanks so much!

It was ok but not 813 calories worth of ok.  I followed some suggestions by other reviewers, i.e; sautéed my mushrooms and chicken in the bacon renderings which definetley added flavor to the dish but as suggested by others, cooking for 30 mins instead of 15 was way too long.  My chicken was dry and overlooked.  Such a shame as I had eaten very minimally during the day to save up for this very calorie hefty dish.

I am reviewing THIS recipe exactly as written. My family all liked it. My only negative was that after cooking the dish & letting it stand until it had cooled a bit, a lot of juice had accumulated in the pan. I will definitely make this again, but next time & I will thicken the juices to make a sauce for serving, and I will sauté the mushrooms & leave out the corn syrup.

5 stars with a few modifications.  I used dijon mustard instead of yellow.  I omitted the corn syrup like many others had recommended.  I only used about 3/4 cup shredded cheese. Really simple to make.  My husband grunted "Mmmm, this is good!"

Recipe has a good base but there is so much more to enhance the flavor. Slice a mixture of button mushrooms and shitake sauté them in the bacon drippings.  Mushrooms are sponges they will take on the flavor of what your adding them to.  Medium small onion same thing slice or dice small add them to the mushrooms to give one more level of flavor add a little thyme leaves maybe a pinch of powdered rosemary. Serve this with Rosemary,Garlic oven roasted red potatoes and you have a 5 star dish.

My family loves this recipe!  The only changes I made were I cooked fresh sliced sweet onion in the bacon fat and used onion powder- approx. 1 tbsp., instead of onion flakes in sauce. Browned chicken in bacon drippings with a dash of EVOO, poured 1/2 sauce over, layered mushrooms, bacon and cheese and put whole pan in oven for 15/20 min.  Last 5 min I added extra sauce so it was hot. Amazing! I always get compliments and requests to make it from friends coming over for dinner.

Made this twice so far this week because we loved it on the first try. The only thing I changed on the second attempt was to pan fry the chicken in a small amount of the bacon drippings to add extra flavor. I really couldn't taste much of a difference except it may have been saltier than original recipe.
I think I'll just stick to the original next go around.

While those that tried it, liked it; the leftovers weren't a big hit.  No one attempted them, but me.  Weird, huh?!  :D  I thought it was still fine.  Also, we didn't use additional honey mustard so, for us, a quarter recipe would've been fine.  'Wasted ingredients there, but now I know.  'Didn't add the onion to it, but sauteed on top under the bacon sounds delicious!

I omitted the corn syrup because I didn't want the sauce to be too sweet; I also added black pepper (because I put it in everything lol) and I used an onion & herb seasoning in the sauce. My boyfriend was absolutely raving about the chicken and the sauce. It was a definite hit, and even my son didn't notice there were mushrooms on this. The taste was really unique. I also love that this is a quick, weekday meal.

Great recipe just as written. I have a problem with the thought of undercooked chicken so I do fry it a bit longer. After having made this as written I have changed it a bit, by adding more honey, more bacon, and more cheese. No reason to mess it all up with different sauces

Followed others' advice and marinated the chicken breasts in worcestershire sauce and garlic, then sauteed the mushroom slices in the bacon fat before browning the chicken breasts. Left out the corn syrup. The sauce made way too much, I reserved half of it as instructed, but we didn't feel it needed it when it came time to serve it. I'll only make half the sauce next time.

New family favorite.  Made it as directed except I baked the bacon. And my chicken took a bit longer to cook in the oven then directed.   I may not have made them thin enough.

Well it was a nice dish.  Certainly a different take on chicken.  I went with other recommendations to omit the corn syrup.  And just used what cheeses I needed to use up.  It was good. All and all a good dish like I said.

Very good copycat version of the restaurant chicken. I took a shortcut by using real bacon bits from a jar, and the chicken came out delicious.

Followed the recipe almost to a T, except I used dion mustard, onion powder instead of flakes, and omitted the corn syrup. It still made a lot of sauce, so I served the leftover chicken over pasta with the sauce. Was even better the next day!

Since chicken breasts are sold by the pound, not the breast, I always wonder why recipes don't tell you how many pounds to buy.  I decided to interpret this as 2 lbs.  You don't really need to pound them all the way down to 1/2 inch, but it's a good idea to pound them all out to the same thickness for even cooking.  I tried marinating them in Worcestershire sauce and garlic as some reviewers had mentioned, but didn't feel it added much and now stick to the seasoned salt.  For the sauce, I leave out the corn syrup and reduce the honey to 1/4 cup.  I also use Dijon mustard instead of yellow and onion powder instead of flakes.  I increase the mushrooms and use the whole 10 oz package.  I sautee them with garlic after browning the chicken breasts.

I was looking for a 'new' chicken recipe, one that I hadn't had yet and stumbled onto this one, Aussie Chicken. It was one of the best recipes I've tried from here and I only deviated from the recipe in 3 areas; I did not add corn syrup to the sauce, used 1/4 cup of dijon and 1/4 cup of yellow mustard and saute'd the chicken in the bacon grease left over. The result was great. Anytime you can add bacon to a recipe it's alright with me. This would also make a great sandwich.

"can I give it more than 2 thumbs up?" my honey asked. I cook in cast iron, so just used same skillet into the oven and saved a dish. I have my own sweet mustard sauce I make, so didn't stay faithful to the recipe there. Only other change was adding onions to the mushrooms and sautéing them in wine. YUM!
Prep seemed to take a while, I may play with making this a casserole with the same flavors and see if it goes together easier.

This was delicious.  Mine took longer to cook than the recipe states, maybe because I only browned for 3 minutes on each side.

Awesome recipe! I also added lime juice and garlic to my marinade and course spicy brown mustard to the sauce. I cut my chicken up in chunks and the marinated it then fried it in the bacon grease. Served it over brown rice spaghetti noodles. Added to my recipe box!

Great recipe and the husband loved it! (Although that's probably not saying -that- much since it does have bacon on it, lol).  I would definitely would make it again, although you don't need that much cheese.  You also don't need the corn syrup. Instead of saving the other half of the honey mustard for serving it with, I'd put it all on the chicken since the sauce was amazing. I served it with rice and green beans, and with such a flavourful dish, the plain sides were a great match.

This was soooo good!!  I did what most people recommended, marinated the chicken in worcestershire, lemon and lime juices instead salt.  I also did do the half yellow mustard and half spicy brown mustard and omitted the corn syrup.  Can't say how that compares to the recipe as written, I can just say that the sauce was amazing!!  The chicken was so tender and juicy!!  This is a keeper!!

Delicious!  I changed it somewhat, but the essence of the original was tried.  I sprinkled my chicken breasts with Mrs. Dash chicken seasoning instead of seasoning salt and followed the recipe by putting them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  I also browned the chicken breasts in the bacon grease (I know that's not healthy, but it saved me from dirtying another pan. I left out the corn syrup and onion flakes and added horseradish and lemon juice to the honey mustard sauce (because that's how I make my honey mustard), and no one in the family likes mushrooms, so those were omitted.  I also put the cheese on the chicken breasts during the last five minutes of cooking because I didn't want it to get hard.  My two picky daughters enjoyed this dish, and anything they both eat is a hit in my house! Thanks, Beckie, for sharing.

I just wish I could give this a million stars! This is my personal FAVORITE dinner, I'd prefer this to any restaurant dish. I have cooked this on a few occasions now both with and without mushrooms and my husband and three kids all love it as well. I don't change anything except I omit the corn syrup. Fantastic dish! great served with mashed potatoes and a veggie... true comfort food!

Good stuff! I only used the sauce that it calls for on the chicken. I did not use the other half to be served with it. It was too overpowering for my personal taste. Next time I will only make half of the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a special family dinner and it got rave reviews!  I did use the corn syrup, although not as much, to thicken the sauce a little.  I added a little cheese, covered and baked, and fifteen minutes or so before finish, uncovered and added the rest of the cheese.  I did not use all the cheese in the recipe.  I will make extra sauce, because everyone LOVED it!  The chicken was very moist.  I did pound the round edge of the breast flat so nothing would fall off, but not thin!  Great recipe!

My sister lives in New Hampshire and we visited a couple of years ago.  She made this for dinner one night and I have to say this is the very best chicken recipe in the entire world in my opinion.  I made it when I got home and it turned out wonderful.  I will make this just like the recipe says but forever!!  Highly addicting...

My cheese & bacon didn't stay on too well but other than that it was delicious! After reading the other reviews I decided to skip the corn syrup as well and cooked my chicken in the bacon grease.

It was definitely different from what we are used to eating. The change up in flavor made it quite interesting, and we enjoyed it. I would make some changes, as other reviewers have suggested. No need for corn syrup, it makes it too sweet and is not necessary. Use Dijon mustard as regular mustard is a little plain.  My husband enjoyed the recipe as I made it, but I think it will be a 5 star the next time I make itwith the adjustments .

Very good. Fried bacon, kept some grease to brown the chicken in. Then sautéed the mushrooms in the leftovers. Extra tasty. Put the cheese on 5 min before.

I agree with Rolanda. This recipe is great if you omit the corn syrup and use Dijon mustard.

This seemed like a fantastic idea but in order for the chicken to cook through in my oven the bacon and cheese burned so if I was to try this again i would either par-boil the chicken or add the topping at a later time in the cooking process

just tried this recipe today.  wow - flavors just burst on the palate.  normally one piece of chicken breast is not going to fill me but this had me almost forcing that last bite.

fried the bacon first, then used the drippings to saute the mushrooms, then in the same skillet browned the chicken (6 breasts, 3 pounds).  followed the recipe for the honey mustard sauce, which ended up with too much (going to use the leftover sauce for almost any next cooking adventure - love that flavor).  placed the breasts in a baking dish, spooned the sauce over them, then layered in the mushrooms (probably 2 - 3 cups raw before the sauteing), the bacon and monterey jack cheese (not nearly the amount called for), baked in a toaster over at 350 for 15 minutes covered with tin foil, then another 15 minute uncovered.

wonderful......

I made this and thought it had amazing taste! I really love foods that pop with flavor...bland foods are so boring. I changed the recipe a tad. I didn't put in the corn starch and I also used turkey bacon rather than regular bacon and Mayo made with olive oil therefore cutting WAY down on calories and fat to make this a healthier meal and it tasted great!

Too sweet. Use less honey. No corn syrup. Marinate chicken in white wine worcestershire, garlic and lime. Serve over egg noodles. Sautee mushrooms in bacon grease, then cook chicken in pan in bacon grease before oven

Wow this could kill someone but at least they would die happy :)  It's a keeper but only every once and a while.  I leave out the mushrooms but I'm sure it's just as good with them if you like mushrooms.  Thank you for sharing  Beckie!

If I make this again I would try it with powdered mustard rather than prepared mustard because the vinegar taste wasn't very good. I'd also use a little less cheese so that the overall dish was less greasy.

Great recipe! I even left the bacon out of the recipe for a little less calories, and it was still great! I don't think you really need the corn syrup in the dressing. I think I will try the recipe without it next time. Also, I probably only used 1 cup of cheese. The chicken was swimming in the honey mustard after taking it out of the oven, so we didn't need the extra that I had left to the side.  You could easily make this meal for 500cal or less!

I tell you what... this was a FANTASTIC recipe! The only changes I made was to brown the chicken in the bacon grease instead of vegetable oil; used Dark Karo syrup instead of light corn syrup; Portabella mushrooms, and brown mustard instead of yellow. Very minor changes really. My kids don't like mushrooms; however, they just devoured this recipe - mushrooms and all! VERY VERY FLAVORFUL! Everyone absolutely loved it. I would highly recommend to even the most discerning of pallets!

This was exceptional.  I cooked a package of bacon and then quickly seared the chicken breasts in the bacon fat before putting them in the oven.  I also sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon fat/chicken juice before spooning them over the chicken smothered in the mustard sauce.  Cooked the chicken for about 25 minutes and then added some Muenster.  There was a delicious sauce in the bottom of the pan when the chicken was done cooking, so I spooned that over quinoa and served asparagus as my veggie.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I cut of the fried bacon and sprinkled it on top of the chicken.  The kids loved the bacon with the cheesy mushrooms more than the juicy chicken.

I normally don't make comments, only read what others post.  My family loved this dish.  I did cut out the mustard, honey, and cornsyrup and just put a bit of dijon mustard on each chicken breasts.  I followed what others said about the bacon and then saute the mushrooms and then chicken in the bacon grease.

I made this last night, and cooking the bacon beforehand was a huge mistake.  I fried it up like normal, but then throwing it in the oven for another 15 minutes burned it, and it formed a hat of cheese, bacon and mushrooms that could be removed entirely from the chicken.  It was too crunchy and black.  I was embarassed in front of my boyfriend and roommate.  Hopefully, they'll eat dinner with me again, and I will put the raw bacon directly on the mushrooms and chicken.  Otherwise, this recipe was great!  No corn syrup either, didn't have that, didn't need it.

I'm so glad I tried this! I'm also glad I used dijon mustard.  I was low on honey so used agave, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good.  I only gave 4 out of 5 stars only because it seems to me this would be very high calorie. I will definitely make this again.

The chicken was tender and the bacon and cheese added a nice twist to an otherwise plain chicken dinner.  However, I was not a fan of the sauce/marinade.  All I tasted was mustard and I do not care for mustard with chicken.

WOW!  and I'm not a fan of mustard.  I don't know if something was going on with my computer or the website the day I made this dish, but I couldn't read the reviews ( which I use for cooking hints, tips and substitutions). So,  I didn't use corn syrup and I browned the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms slightly in the bacon grease.  I also wound up using Kraft shredded Mexican 4 cheese for topping.  Yum Yum is all I can say.  My husband agreed and he's quite picky.   Served with asparagus sauteed in the bacon drippings with a bit of Balsamic vinegar and mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I've been making this recipe for the past 5 years and my husband still loves it.  I use this exact recipe  except I make additional sauce for leftovers and fry the bacon, mushrooms, and chicken in the same skillet.  Don't leave out the honey or corn syrup.  Those are the ingredients that make this recipe so delicious.  I also make 2 cups of cooked rice that I put in the bottom of the baking dish and then cover with the chicken and most of sauce.  Excellent one-dish meal!

This is soooo good!!! Even my hubby, who absolutely hates chicken of any kind, LOVED it!!!! I didn't have any light corn syrup or parsely, so left them out, but all other ingredients were used. The chicken was tender and sooooo tasty. This will be on the dinner menu frequently in my house!!!

This is an amazing chicken recipe. We totally love this honey mustard sauce. I only put 1/2 the amount of light corn syrup on it tho and it was awesome. I fried the chicken in bacon drippings as well.This recipe is going in our family recipes and the sauce is also going the the sauce section along with my homemade BBQ sauce. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks so much for this tasty recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for leaving out the season salt.  We all enjoyed it; I will make this again, probably on a weekend when I have time to cook.  I put the chicken in a gallon sized freezer bag and pounded it with a rolling pin--no messy cleanup.

This is a very delicious dish.   I made it exactly as the recipe called with a couple of minor exceptions.   I left out the corn syrup from the dressing and made sure I used a higher end mustard instead of standard yellow.   (Half stone ground and half dijon was wonderful)   Also, I sauted the mushrooms in the leftover bacon fat so the oven portion of the process is really just to melt the cheese.

I marinade in worchestershire and lime juice first. Bake chicken for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Add honey mustard, sauteed mushrooms, cooked bacon, and cheese, and bake for another 10 minutes.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe and was very disappointed.  We love all the ingredients...just not the combination.  One reviewer did suggest  sautee the mushrooms which might have helped.

Made this last week for my husband and 6yo son, it was great!  I do not normally like honey mustard, but I was very impressed!  I took what others said and made the sauce w/ 1/2 dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard with no corn syrup.  I also marinated in worstershire.  I also sauteed mushrooms in onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and S&P. Served with broccoli.  Will definitely make again.  I loved it!

I found this dish excellent and my husband (a Kiwi) particularly enjoyed it . My only comment is having read the ingredients I was suspicious of the ratio of mayonnaise so I used a full cup instead of a ¼ cup which in my view is needed . I can’t get corn syrup in France therefore I used 1/4cup honey and ¼ cup maple syrup which in fact in my view added  a very nice flavouring alternative especially with the bacon element in the dish

I have been a member for a while now and this is my first review because it was so delicious. I loved everything about it. The sauce was divine and we used the extra sauce again on a hot sandwich that I made another night. IT was really good as well. My husband actually said it would be good on a hot sandwich and he was right! Definitely make this because you won't be upset or unsatisfied if you do!

We liked this a lot.  I messed up and used way too much seasoned salt on the chicken, my fault entirely--I just made it again and did not season the chicken at all, I did dip it in egg and then lightly flour before cooking which made it even better.  Every ingredient - including the bacon (second time around I used low sodium bacon which was a better choice), has ample salt in it so I would definitely cut back.  Excellent flavors, this was really delicious, in spite of my overseasoning it.  And I am not a no-salt freak.  I love spicy, well seasoned dishes, but this one absolutely did not need any extra.  Got rave reviews the second time. This is perfect for a buffet, or entertaining friends. Delicious and is very appealing visually as well.

We LOVED this recipe, my husband wished there was more! I didn't have dried onion flaked, so I just fried some in very little olive oil & sweet chili sauce. This recipe definitely deserves a 5, well done ;)

Great recipe!  Like others, I eliminated the corn syrup.  I also used a really good German mustard and used cheddar, since that is what we had. Thanks for sharing.

A whole lot of yummy in this one!  Too bad its not a little healthier so I could make it more often.  Like some of the earlier reviewers, I skipped the corn syrup, used dijon, and sauteed the mushrooms and cooked the bacon in same skillet. Also marinaded chicken in worsteshire, lime and garlic which wouldn't be bad on its own.  Thanks for recipe!!

This was good.  A bit mustardy for me (and I like mustard).  I think next time I'd definitely read some of the reviews and change a few things up (especially using grey poupon instead of yellow mustard) to see if we like it a bit better.  I also think I would maybe sautee the mushrooms next time.

I have to say that I was suprisingly pleased.  Not a huge fan of some honey mustard recipes. It got rave reviews from everyone!! I agreed with everyone else about the corn syrup.  I fixed it without it tasted and decided that it didn't need it. And to die down the sweetness of the honey added an extra 2 tablespoon of Mayo and using a whisk it turned out great. Would be great over salads as well :)  I also did as everyone suggested and used the Montreal steak seasoning by McCormick and had an idea and added a little bit of Smokehouse maple by McCormick as well. I think what knocks this over the top was it was so juicy. By searing it till its golden on both sides and cooking it for 15mins in oven then I flipped added more sauce and let it go again for a few minutes.  Then added the toppings and waited just till the cheese melted.  Everyone was asking me for the recipe.  And I have to say it is very appealing to look at too!

This was okay. We didn't love it, but there was nothing bad about it either. My husband thought something other than honey mustard would have given it more flavor. I had a lot of leftovers.

I made this recipe for my roommates and my boyfriend.  My boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms, so I left those out on his portion, but he still loved it.  Everyone else's chicken was made following the recipe exactly and they all thought it was delicious.    If I make this again, I think I'll add a few extra seasonings to the chicken in addition to the seasoning salt.

this was wonderful.  I didn't follow the recipe to a "T," though I should have.  My honeymustard sauce needed a little more sweetness, but I took advice from others to leave out the syrup stuff.  Get good quality bacon; mine wasn't quality because i let my husband get it from the grocery store...'el cheapo!  The chicken was moist and very, very tasty.  it reminded me of OUtback a little.  My picky son ate 1 1/2 breasts; he skipped out on the sauce.  I cooked everything separately before assemblying the chicken.  For instance, i good the mushrooms in a little evoo, then I backed the bacon in the oven to get a desired crunchiness.  I didn't have shredded cheese, only sliced deli cheese, but it was good just the same.

I will make this dish again and again and again. My husband LOVED this dish, and it was simple to make-which makes my life a lot easier.. i used dijion mustard indstead of yellow, because i personally prefer the taste, and i also avoided the corn syrup because of previous reviews (and i didnt have any at the time) but that didnt seem to effect the dish what-so-ever.

I think this is THE best chicken recipe EVER!!!! I only make this about once a year b/c of the high calories and fat count. But it is soooo worth it. My entire family LOVES this! Thank you for sharing.

AMAZING!!! It smelled like heaven in my oven... My husband ate three chicken breasts himself because he liked it so much. All 5 of my childrencleared their plates without complaints, which doesn't happen that often. Definitely a keeper!

I followed recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully! I suggest KEEPING the caro syrup, as it makes the sauce thicker and tastier. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe and I make it all the time. I did change it a little. I don't use any corn syrup. Instead of using honey & mustard seperately, I use honey mustard.  I do not add the chesse until the last 5 minutes of cooking.  YUMMY!

Great recipe.  I omitted the corn syrup because I did not have any but the sauce was still perfect.  I don't care for mushrooms so I sauted onions and green peppers.  I forgot to pound the chicken but it still came out great next time I will pound it though so the toppings can stay.  GREAT recipe

I thought that the sauce was just a tad too sweet but overall a very good dish. The mushrooms were my favorite! Might follow other reviewer and try sometime in the crockpot with a little less of the sweet in it.

I skipped the oil and pan and made this in the crockpot.  Turned out great.

This was great! My husband and son both loved it! I didn't have Monterrey Jack, so I used sharp cheddar, and I also added one chopped green onion. I used baby portabellos as well. Delicious! A definite keeper!

I was too skeptical to make the honey mustard sauce in this recipe because it had so many mixed reviews!  So I ended up using a jar of one of the really good brands of honey mustard from my grocery store.  That also saved a lot of time ;)  I also doubled the mushrooms because I had a lot of fresh mushrooms in my fridge that needed to be used.  And I used some of Mrs. Dash's salt free table blend with the seasoning salt. This recipe was really easy to make and we loved it.  I plan on making it again soon.

This recipe was so, so good.  Juicy, flavorful and definately nice enough to serve company.  I'm putting this in my "make again" folder.  The only thing I will change next time is I will only make half the sauce.  The directions say to use half and save half for later- so instead I'll just half the ingredients so I don't waste any.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was wonderful!  The only changes I made was to leave the corn syrup out of the sauce and we didn't miss it, and I didn't have enough yellow mustard so subbed half dijon for it.  Gave the sauce a nice hint of spice.  Directions were spot on as far as cooking time.  Chicken was moist and perfectly cooked when it came out of the oven.  The "Alice" chicken is my favorite Outback item, and it was great to find a recipe that comes so close!

I used only half the sauce amount to cut down on the calories and fat for my pasta side. It was still very tasty. Served with steamed veggies. Also, I made up my own concoction for a pasta side. It included angel hair pasta, shrooms, garlic, butter, olive oil, bacon, and Italian Cheese.

Not like the restaurant dish at all.  It was an OK recipe, but I will not make it again.  The recipe makes 1 3/4 cups of honey-mustard sauce which is way to much and a waste of ingredients. Plus it's extremely sweet; you must omit the corn syrup. The mushrooms should be sauteed prior to topping on the chicken.

This was just "ok" for me...the sauce was too mustardy and, in my humble opinion, overwhelmed any of the other flavors going on with the dish.  If you do make this recipe, halve the sauce ingredients as you will have more than enough for your dish.

Very good!!! I had experienced a number of flops with a similar recipe, so I am thrilled that this was "the one"!  I reduced the honey to 1/4 cup and kept the corn syrup.  This was a great honey mustard sauce.  I also marinaded the chicken (dale's sauce & lemon juice) and browned the chicken in the bacon grease for flavor.  Cooked the chicken 15 minutes, then added the cheese, then baked 10 minutes more.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great flavor combination!  As suggested by others, I left the corn syrup out of the honey mustard sauce, and we didn't miss it (my husband is allergic to corn syrup).  I also used Worcestershire sauce and minced garlic with the seasoned salt to "kick up" the marinade a little.  To save dishes, I used the same skillet to fry the bacon, then saute the mushrooms (in bacon drippings; not sure why the recipe seems to indicate they would go into the 9x13 dish raw . . .), then brown the chicken (also in drippings).  Baked for 15 min. as indicated.  Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as posted and I thought it was awesome! Unfortunately, my boyfriend felt it was a bit too sweet and too mustardy and only rated it a 3. He said he didn't hate it, but he would not ever ask for me to make it again. I will make this again if I am only cooking for myself, but that doesn't happen very often.  This does have a very high fat content with all the ingredients, but it sure was tasty!

If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would. Just a little too much sauce and a little too sweet for me, but my boyfriend devoured it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is divine.  I have made it a few times and nothing but rave reviews.  The only thing is that I too, cut the sauce back by half.  U really don't need it.  Excellent recipe.

Great dish!  I used reviewers' recommendations and cooked the bacon first, then cooked the mushrooms and chicken in the bacon grease.  I'll go half on the sauce next time, too (as others have suggested, the amount specified in the recipe twice what's needed).  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the directions for this the first time and it was good.  Not something I would go out of my way to make again.  Due to the other reviews, maybe it was the honey mustard???.  I might try a store bought one next time.   I love honey mustard anything, so I am not sure why this didn't taste good to me.    I did variy up the recipe the next time, but not a lot.  The only changes I made was instead of honey mustard, I used BBQ sauce.  I also used Cheedar Cheese.  My husband and I both really liked this version better than the original.  I plan on making this recipe with BBQ sauce in the future.

I have been making this recipe for over 5 years now and is one of my family's "MUST HAVE" meals. I know many of us like to "tweak" ingredients in recipes, but trust me when I say - "Don't change a thing"!! Follow the exact directions and I promise you will have an all time Chicken recipe for a lifetime. Absolutely Delicious. I love to serve this with mashed potatoes (and put a little extra honey mustard sauce on top) and roasted brussell sprouts. YUMMY in OUR TUMMY!!!!!

This was really good and probably would have been better as written, but I wanted to make it a bit lighter. I brushed the honey mustard sauce over the chicken breasts, and topped it with the sliced mushrooms, bacon, and cheese and then stuck it in the oven for 30 minutes. I would place foil over it for a bit so the cheese doesn't burn. Very good taste this way!

wanted to give it 6 stars! AMAZING! it was like i couldn't get a large enough bite and though i was stuffed afterward, i was still craving this for an hour or two. i made a few small changes: since i didn't have any honey, i used some prepared honey mustard that i had already. i also sauteed some onions with the mushrooms and added about 1/2 teaspoon of thyme and sage with a dash of garlic. YUMMMMMMMMM!

Great Recipe! I pounded the chicken and left out the Mushrooms. Next time I will probably leave off the cheese and bacon to save time or maybe try bacon bits.Either way it taste great.

This was pretty good in my opinion. My husband and my son both loved it, which is why this gets 5 stars as they are VERY picky eaters. I myself would give 4 stars. I followed the advice of other reviewers and marinated the chicken in worschester sauce for several hours. I didnt use the cornsyrup, and only used one cup of cheese. I think it would have been better without the mushrooms. I did sautee them but i think they would have been better left on the side. This is a good recipe and I will make it again. Thanks!

Absolutely Amazing!  I followed the directions exactly and my family loved it.  I will omit the corn syrup next time b/c almost every review suggest it and I'm curious.  But, I'm not sure how this could taste any better than it already does.  Would double the stars if I could!

Very nice. Didnt use much of the honey mustard sauce,my dad thought it was too salty (and I made it without corn syrup like others suggested) Used lots of suggestions from other reviewers and it turned out great. I would suggest fresh mushrooms, the canned ones smelled and tasted a little weird to me. Also, serve  with something light! I served it with a rich garlic mashed potato recipe, and we all thought we were going to explode! It was soooo filling!

very simple and delicious. Son-in-love said it was better than he had eaten in his favorite eatery. Served a mushroom,onion, bacon mixture on the side because some don't like "shrooms".Did top chicken with bacon,cheese and sauce as stated.

I have been making this recipe for over six years now. This is one of my hubby' favorite dishes. The only thing I canged was leaving out the mushrooms... don't care for them and if you don't have the corn syrup... it's okay. I have made the recipe with and without it. I don't think it makes that big of a difference. It is no doubt a five star recipe.

Oooooh Yeah...this is a keeper!  I can't wait to serve this to company.  I used monterrey jack cheese and it was fabulous!  I cooked the bacon (one slice per piece of chicken) in the microwave and crumbled it before topping the chicken with it.  I sauteed the mushrooms in a little olive oil/butter mixture and removed them before browning the chicken (which I marinated with a little worcestershire and sprinkled with seasoned salt).  I did not use the corn syrup per others reviews.  From there I assembled as directed.  Great recipe!

I really enjoy this recipe! 4 servings does make an aweful lot of sauce, so I always cut it in half for that reason. Also, I like to use chopped or sliced Roma tomatoes on top for those that don't like mushrooms.

I love making this chicken dish.  It is excellent.  The first time I made this I did add mushrooms to half of the chicken breasts, because there are some in my family that don't like mushrooms.  Very good with or without.  The last time I made this I used the already cooked bacon, that u just have to heat up, saves a lot of time.  And if you have any leftover honey mustard sauce you can used it as a salad dressing.

Yummy, but very rich! Tasted like something from a restaurant- definately a "treat" meal. Next time I will half or quarter the sauce ingredients- I used 5 breasts and still have 3/4 of the mixture left. (And any more sauce would have been overpowering!)

Always a crowd pleaser. I make this when we have guests over, especially if they are the type that taste is more important than calorie and fat content. This chicken really tastes good. Remember to pound the chicken breasts, though. If you don't, they do not get cooked all the way through.

I love honey mustard and this was very good. I didn't use corn syrup(didn't have) and the chicken that I used was frozen so I didn't brown them at all. Instead I baked covered in the oven for about an 45 minutes and then uncovered for 20 minutes. I probably more then doubled the mushrooms. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly step by step. I looked online at the Restaurant's menu........ omg! we'll defintely be eating in for so much cheaper. Thanks for a budget friendly meal idea.

I did change this a little - no corn syrup, light Miracle Whip instead of mayo, turkey bacon and low-fat cheese - great flavors and much healthier than the original recipe!

This is sooo yummy!!  I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and sautéed the mushrooms first then cooked the bacon then cooked the chicken all in the same pan.  I used chicken breast filets so didn't pound them out.  I also used the Honey mustard recipe from this site for the dressing.  Made 5 servings and oh so yummy!

Phenomenal!! This is one of the best chicken dinners I have ever made. My husband who is a big meat and potatoes kind of guy absolutely loves it. Everyone that comes over and eats this always leaves with the recipe. This what I do differently (I never have been one to follow directions,lol):
1. I use honey mustard to begin with then follow the directions as normal(I am not a bid yellow mustard fan). 
2. I cook the bacon first in a frying pan, then cook the chicken in the same frying pan.
3. Sometimes I omit the mushrooms (husbands not a bid fan of them) but is great with them too(I put them on half, I happen to love them).
No matter how you make this dish, it is wonderful.... Kudos for this recipe, thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  The only thing I'll change in the future is that I'll actually go to the trouble to make the honey mustard sauce.  We used a store bough this time, and it lacked flavor.  The chicken was perfectly juicy and tender.

AWESOME! A few minor changes. I marinated the chicken overnight in worchestershire (sp) overnight with the seasoned salt and minced garlic. Also, did not use the corn syrup. The chicken is fabulous! Served with spinach salad and and garlic cheesy bread! Will make again! Espically when we have company!

Served this tonight and my family raved about it!  I did omit the corn syrup because the honey mustard was sweet enough without it.  Everything else I followed to a "t" and it was great!!  I served with a salad and baked potato and it was a quick, easy meal.  Definitely a keeper!!

Very rich and very delicious!  I didn't pound out the chicken but it turned out fine regardless.  Instead of the seasoning salt, I marinaded the chicken in some worcestershire sauce, lime juice, garlic, and a little prepared honey mustard.  I halved the sauce and didn't reserve any for dipping.  Instead of yellow mustard I used dijon honey mustard, no corn syrup, only half the honey called for, and no onion flakes because I don't have any.  I used an 8 oz. can of mushrooms instead of fresh, and cheddar cheese instead of the blend, and I also skipped the parsley garnish.  I took reviewer advice and used the bacon drippings to brown the chicken, which turned out great.  This struck me as a recipe that would be very hard to mess up, easily modified without major consequences, and delicious virtually no matter what.  I'll make this again for future high-fat splurge dinners. ;)

This was so good and so easy to make!
THe chicken was moist and tasty. I used less cheese and sauteed onions with the mushrooms before baking.

This recipe is wonderful.  My only modification was I didn't use as much corn syrup in the sauce, but followed everything else exact.  One suggestion would be to make chicken fingers or something to dip in the honey mustard the next night as there is a lot of left over sauce and it's too good to waste.  This recipe will be made again and again in our house.

Very Good Recipe.  I sauted butterflied chicken (instead of pounding) in the bacon fat for flavor.  I only added 1/8 cup of corn syrup and used low fat mayo in the sauce.  The sauce is definately more a sweeter honey mustard than a mustardy honey mustard.  I would suggest dijon instead of yellow mustard if you prefer the later and skip the corn starch.  I only used 1 cup of cheese (and I love cheese) but I think that was plenty.  Will make again.

I liked this recipe a lot.  I omitted the corn syrup as well and threw on some caramelized onions and portabella mushrooms.  It was great that day and the next for lunch served with some twice baked potatoes and fresh green beans.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because I didnt have all of the ingredients. I will try it again when I have them all and come back again.I didn't have mushrooms and I didnt have alot of bacon. But the recipe turned out great without those things. My husband absolutely loved it, and neither one of the kids complained which is always nice.

My husband is not a big fan of the honey mustard flavor, so I add about a tablespoon and a half of maple syrup, about a tablespoon of soy sauce, and a dash of marsala wine.  Random, I know, but he loved it!!  I also sauteed the mushrooms and chicken together in the bacon drippings.  Not the healthiest dish, but very good!

Excellent.  The whole family really enjoyed this dish.  I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease for about 10 mins per side until it was lightly browned and then prepared for the oven.  Didn't add the corn syrup as we didn't have any but it was still very good.  I sauteed the mushrooms as others suggested.  

Bon Apetit!

Outstanding recipe. I used some advice from previous reviewers and marinated the chicken in some worcteshire and lime juice - it turned out great and my husband loved it too. Only problem was I ran out of chicken and people wanted more!

This recipe is so simple and the results are excellent!  I loved the marinade and I will probably try it on plain baked chicken, without the bacon, mushrooms and cheese to lighten it up a bit.  Also, I used canned mushrooms and they worked just fine.

My husband and kids LOVED this chicken.  I'm not a huge fan of honey mustard, but it was still good.  I may try it with a different type of mustard next time (all I had was French's yellow stuff.)  Very good overall though.

This is my husband's favorite dish at a certain eatery. He thought I got take out from there tonight. I never order chicken at a steakhouse so my opinion is different. I thought this was way too salty. It was good but I couldn't get through 1 piece. I made it with boneless thighs rather than breasts. I left out the corn syrup per another cook's suggestion. Also, there is no need to bake this dish. I did it all in one skillet and covered at the end to simulate the oven step. There is a lot less to clean up afterwards this way. I used bacon drippings for the oil also. Next time I will make it with 1/2 the seasoned salt maybe less.

My entire family loved this dish, including my four year old who is a very picky eater, he actually ate an entire breast on his own.  I followed other reviewers and marinated the chicken in worcestershire & lime juice and excluded the corn syrup. The only recommendation my husband had was to saute the mushrooms a little prior to adding them to the dish. Thanks for a great recipe! Update 3 Days Later: My four year old has been asking for this chicken everyday since I made it, he loves the dip!

I think I did something wrong. It tasted very much like mustard. I only added 1 Tbsp of corn syrup because of other reviews. And kept everything else the same. It was ok. But I would rather go to the resturaunt. I might try again?.?.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years.  I think it is great!  It takes a little while to pull together so don't make it on a busy night.  I never add the corn syrup.  I don't think it needs honey and corn syrup.  It always turns out moist and has tons of great flavor.

This is what my husband requests every birthday / fathers day. I do saute the mushrooms before putting on the chicken and I usually use more mushrooms, bacon and a little more cheese than called for! Serve over pasta - yum!

Pretty good!  The chicken was very flavorful.  I didn't use mushrooms or corn syrup because I was out of both.  The honey mustard sauce was a little too mustardy as a result.  If you omit the corn syrup completely I would add a little more honey to the sauce.  Next time I think I'll just try using prepared lowfat honey mustard instead to lower the calories.

I really like this recipe. It's very similar to the Monterey Chicken at Chili's and very good. It's a great adult and kid pleaser.

This is my all time favorite chicken dish... true it may not be the healthiest, but it sure is the tastiest!  I always go light on the onion flakes and hold the mushrooms, and I use the sauce in different variations on everything.  This dish is fantastic served over brown rice with extra sauce.  I really think that it's the sauce that makes the dish.

with all the great reviews, i was excited to make this recipe.  it did turn out good, just not as awesome as i was hoping.  the mustard sauce tasted good on the chicken, but i didnt care for it as a dipping sauce.  cooked the chicken for 30 minutes.  i would wait to add the bacon and cheese until the end so the cheese doesnt dry up and get too hard.  good recipe, just not "outback" good!  thanks!

I've made this a few times, and each time I sit and think "this was easier than the last time I made it!"  It seems like it would involve quite a bit of time but really doesn't.  And it's delish!!  We skip the mushrooms, but everything else we make as stated.  Yum!

Very tasty!  I accidentally bought chicken strips which were harder to cook well.  The honey mustard sauce is very delicious!  Following the advice of others, I did not add the corn syrup.  It looks gross, but tastes great.

I have made this recipe numerous times now.  This is definately my "go to recipe" when I'm entertaining people I want to impress.  The recipe is rather expensive if you are cooking for a lot of people, but well worth every penny.  EVERY time I make it I get raving revues from EVERYONE, then I have to share the recipe (maybe I should just keep copies on hand).  The best part is that it's easy to make and prep ahead of time.  I like to get everything ready up until the point of putting it in the oven, then place dish in the fridge to finish baking right before dinner.  Trust me, if you need to impress for dinner ... you will not go wrong with this one!

I thought for sure we would love this with all the great reviews it has. This was just average for us. I love chicken, I love bacon, and I LOVE cheese.  Maybe we just don't like them so well all together.  It had an odd flavor.  This reminded me of something one might get at a fast food restaurant.  We probably won't be making this again.  My fiance liked the honey mustard sauce and suggested making just plain old honey mustard chicken next time with this sauce.   So we will use the sauce.

This is a VERY good recipe!!! I love it. I learned to cook when I found this recipe on allrecipes and I try to convince my family to let me make it all the time!!! But when you(Rebecca) say to use seasoning salt I think, now keep in mind this IS a suggestion, it may give the chicken more flavor if you use Mrs.Dash. Plus it will cut back on the salt and if you use to much (like I did with the seasoning salt,Disastrous)it still makes the dish taste good. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

This was really great, but not quite like the restaurant version. I wanted the hone mustard to be a bit more substantial, and a bit less mustardy. Also, I would choose to put the cheese and bacon on after the chicken is mostly cooked. We will definitely have this again, though, just with a few adjustments.

DH rates this dish 5 stars but I didn't care for it much (my rate 3, his 5, so I rated it an overall 4). The honey was overpowering and my 4yo took one bite and refused to eat it because of the mustard.

This recipe is so quick, easy, and delicious. And you can use the honey mustard recipe on it's own for anything else you like with honey mustard. It is by far the best honey mustard I've ever had.

This was pretty good! I, too, marinaded my chicken in Italian dressing.  I also took the advice of others and sauteed my mushrooms and chicken in the bacon grease.  This truly was an unhealthy meal, though, so I tried to make it healthier by using reduced fat mayo, 2% cheese, and leaving out the corn syrup.  It was ok, but I don't think it was worth the humongous number of calories.  To eat that much fat in a meal, it had better be a juicy filet mignon or something!

Great recipe! I subsituted real bacon bits because it's easier and sometimes I don't like the texture of chewy bacon.  I omitted the corn syrup like others said and the honey mustard was great.  Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I skipped the mushrooms though and I'll be using the leftover honey mustard as a dipping sauce.

I enjoyed how tender the chicken was.  The bacon and cheese were delicious on the chicken.  The sauce was a little too sweat for me.  I would use a little less.

WOW.  What can I say.  This was amazing!  I could eat the sauce out of the bowl.  I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease and omitted the mushrooms because we don't like them.  I would hold off adding the bacon and the cheese until late in the cooking time so that it just melts and doesn't burn.  A definite keeper!  I will make again!

This recipe is great!  I made this for some dinner guests and they raved about it.  I made it just as it is written but served it with choice of the honey mustard sauce or ranch dressing.  My friends have been asking when they are coming over again.  I served these with twice baked potatoes, and a nice, crisp salad.  The mustard sauce was a little sweet but my hubby loved it and ate the leftover sauce on many things, including dipping his pretzels in them.

Absolutely fantastic!  All that plain yellow mustard was creeping me out, so I do the same amount but do 1/2 with grainy mustard and 1/2 yellow mustard.  I'm not big on sweets, so I put less honey and compensated with more corn syrup.  Love it, love it, love it!

We all liked this recipe but I don't think it was one of those "to die for" dishes.  I admit that I added too much cheese as I do with anything that calls for it or garlic but it still was a little too rich and mustardy for me.  Next time I will tone it down a bit and not use as much mustard.  I did double the sauce recipe per reviews and used quite a bit of that so maybe that's why it was too rich.  Chicken was tender and juicy.

3 years now I've been coming back to this recipe to print it out, because someone steals my copy after I cook it. I know the restaurant that this recipe is mimmicking, and if it's not exact, then it's so close that no one can tell the difference.  My sister still believes that the sauce has a hint of cinammon in it, and while I'm still not convinced.. she always adds a dash o'cinnamon to it, and never gets a negative comment.  My only advise on this recipe is that you better make double the sauce, cuz it's so good that everyone will want double.. and then you can use the sauce later in the week for something else.

Yummmmm!!!  I crave this dish but rarely make it because it's way too high in fat and calories.  I've never had the restaurant version but I doubt it could be any better than this.  Maybe I'll splurge and make this dish this week.  I can always get back on the diet next week!  ha ha

We absolutely love this dish... it is a great dish to serve when you have guest.  And there is plenty of sauce, that you can add more chicken to it.

This is the best chicken recipe I have. The first time I made it for a dinner party and they all said it was the best chicken they had ever had. It is easy to put together and a fantastic way to spice up chicken.

Excellent chicken dish!  I've made this before, but this time I ommitted the onions, used a honey mustard dijon instead of the regular yellow mustard, and topped it with cheddar cheese.  I also covered the chicken with all of the sauce, not reserving any.  It turned out delicious!

Yummy. Loved the honey mustard sauce very good. I used less cheese. Next time I would add more mushrooms on my piece of chicken (I love mushrooms) Everyone else like it the way it was and may even prefer no mushrooms (they are not mushroom lovers like me!)

This dish is excellent!  One of my true favorites.  I cooked it as described and comes out perfect every time.  The chicken is nice and moist and the sweet/salty combination is a real treat.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is sooooooo good and yes sooooo bad for you. It is worth it once in a while though. My husband said the honey mustard alone is worth keeping this recipe. The only thing that I did different is marinate the chicken for about 30 minutes with a smoke flavored marninade just brushed on with the seasoning salt. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the advice of many to use dijon mustard and I omitted the corn syrup.  In omitting the corn syrup, I found the dish to be tasty and it produced just the right amount of 'sauce'. Any extra honey mustard sauce can be used for salads or dipping.

This dish was very good for something different, however it was too tangy to have all the time. 

I recommend putting more cheese on top than the recipe calls for, but my family is a bunch of cheese-a-holics.

One of the best recipes in my cookbook!  I use the bacon drippings instead of vegetable oil and sometimes i use provolone and sharp cheddar cheese when I want an extra kick.  YUM!

This is my favorite restaurant meal, so I tried it at home the other night.  Thought it was great, didn't change a thing other than marinading the chicken in italian/worcestire and I cheated by using the pre-cooked bacon.  My husband and I both love it.  I prefer a sweeter sauce, so I thought this one was fantastic.  If you don't care for the sweeter taste, you may want to alter it.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have seasoning salt and forgot to buy mushrooms, but it still was great- tender, flavorful chicken.  The colby-jack cheeses complement the sauce well.  I sauteed the chicken in the bacon grease instead of vegetable oil and was happy with the result.

MMMM....really good.  I've never had the restaurant aussie chicken but this was delicious.  I made the sauce and the bacon before hand and then did up the whole thing at dinner time.  I wasn't sure about the sauce it looked very 'mustardy' but it was a nice compliment to the chicken.  We did have alot of sauce leftover so next time I will cut it in half to save ingredients.

It was good, but think it would have been better without the corn syrup.  It was really too sweet for my taste.  Next time I make I will leave out the corn syrup.  Hopefully that's the trick!

Really very good!  Pounding the chicken flat is important.  I took some tips from others and marinated the breasts in Italian dressing and Worstershire sauce, and sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon fat.  Delish!

Pretty good but needed a little kick, possibly some pepper added to the honey mustard or maybe some capers. Overall it's a keeper.

It's good, but it's rich and kind of greasy.  No mushrooms, so left those out.  Also left out the corn syrup. I think that would make the sauce way too runny and sweet.  And why dilute the honey?  Used spicy mustard in the sauce and the sauce was definitely the best part.  Browned the chicken in a little of the bacon grease.  The cheese and bacon tend to want to slide off the chicken, especially as everything cools.  Again, it was pretty good, but not for everynight eating if you want to stay healthy!

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the calories but it is a great recipe.  As suggested a few times below, I omitted the corn syrup in the sauce and did not miss a thing.  In fact, if I did add it, i bet it would have been too sweet.  I browned the chicken in the same pan after I fried the bacon then I sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon and chicken reserves.  This gave lots of flavor and less to clean up.  In addition, this dish is great for a dinner party - I was able to assemble in the morning and heared up in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner.  (As suggested by others, I increased cook time to 1/2 hour).  Great recipe.

I had high expectations of this one.  I love honey mustard and sweet foods but this was more bitter.  Will maybe make again but not a favorite.

I needed a quick way to cook chicken, and was delighted with this recipe.  My kids loved it, and so did I.  I didn't have time to salt and let sit for 30 min, but that didn't seem to matter.  I added the season salt as I browned th e chicken.  Left off the mushrooms, as we don't care for them.  Also broke the bacon into pieces to top the chicken, which made it easier to cut/serve.  It did make more sauce than we needed for 6 breasts, probably could make 8-10 chicken breasts and still have enough sauce.

I love this recipe. I have been making it for years. The only thing that I changed was that I use honey mustard that's already prepared. Great recipe for a quick dinner!

Delicious!  I did not salt the chicken and refrigerate for 30 minutes, and I also left out the corn syrup to eliminate carbs and sugar, and it was great!  My husband said this recipe is "definitely a keeper"!

I lowered the fat content by using half of the cheese, turkey bacon instead of regular and I did not brown the chicken in oil.  I put it in the oven raw and baked it longer.  I also used only half of the honey and I still thought it was too sweet.

Great recipe. I do a few things differently but no matter what its a great taste. I have never actually done the whole seasoning salt thing, mostly because its just something I dont have in my spice cabinet. I filet my chicken instead of pounding it and I cook my bacon in the microwave (every package wil let you know how to do this if you have never done it before). By fileting and microwaving the bacon, it really cuts down on the mess. Regardless, its delicious and you gotta give it a try!

Robust flavor! Recipe it took a couple of pans to prepare, which is kind of a downside for me, as my sweetie and I weren't wild about this recipe.  The recipe is very good; I think we may not have cared for it as much as others as we may lean towards simpler tastes.  I loved the sauce though and would definitely use it on its own.

Both my picky teenagers loved this. I did not pound the chicken, so it took about twice as long to bake and I did not add the cheese until the last five minutes.  Next time I will half the sauce recipe.  You could even use a prepared honey mustard.

I was disappointed with this recipe.   The mixture of flavors didn't go well together, just too much going on. And it's very salty.  The sauce was the only good thing.  If I did make this again, I would omit the seasoning salt, and marinade the chicken in the sauce instead. And then just bake without the mushrooms, bacon and cheese.

My family really enjoyed this recipe as each member had seconds and raved.  I omitted the mushrooms because they had been in the refrigerator too long and I substituted bacon bits since I hate to fry bacon.  It still tasted great.  Could possibly half the sauce recipe, it makes a lot.

This was really good. Very rich! I overcooked the chicken a little bit, I think so next time I will shorten the baking time.

This is absolutely my husband's favorite chicken dish, I love it as well.  We've made it at least a dozen times.  I actually don't normally like honey mustard on anything, but the combination of everything that goes into it makes it one tasty dish!  I served it for a friend who is a picky eater and she loved it as well.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this recipe last night and my boyfriend really enjoyed it.  He suggested I add a can of diced tomatos--so I'll definately try that next time!

My husband and I loved this dish; it was easy to prepare, perfect for a hot night when you don't want an oven on too long.  I changed the cheese to a mix of swiss and gouda, since I din't have the Jack, and it was scrumptous!!  He could not stop raving!  Definitely a weekly meal!

not too impressed, in fact i was kinda disappointed.  but then, i'm not much of a mustard fan. but i figured because it got such great reviews i'd like it anyway.  next time i'd make it with BBQ sauce.  my husband liked it, though.  i read a review where they had spinach noodles as a side.  terrible.  didn't not go with the chicken very well at all.  i'd go with mashed potatoes instead.

I've made this dish many times and the chicken turns out tender every time .If you don't have time to make the honey mustard sauce I reccomend a replacing it with a store bought BBQ sauce.

Thank you, Rebecca, for this recipe.  It was excellent.  I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe and the family had a great dinner.  It was pretty easy and quick (great stress reliever for me by pounding the chicken).

I liked this dish very much. I am giving this a 4 star because of the high fat content. I would consider this more of a comfort food. I made just a few changes. I cut the chicken in pieces before cooking and sprinkled it with McCormicks chicken rub. I also put almost all the honey mustard sauce over the chicken before cooking it in the oven. By the way the sauce was wonderful; I will make this again It was a nice change. Thanks!

Need I rate it?  It's AMAZING.  Everyone loved it.  With broccoli and wild rice, it couldn't have gone over better.  I have no mallet so I use a rolling pin to pound the chicken.

This was incredibly good! My boyfriend loved it-- and I don't like honey mustard typically but really did like this dish. I added a bit more chopped onions than called for, and used chicken cutlets instead of whole breasts. Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken looked great, if nothing else. I really liked the honey mustard sauce aswell and I have some left overs for sandwiches etc. I made one huge mistake though: I like dark meat so I bought some chicken thighs instead. Unfortunatley I didn't remove the skin so it became very greasy and difficult to eat. It might be great if you don't make my mistake but I probably wont try this again. Thanks anyway!

This was excellent! My husband and I loved it. If someone in your family doesn't like mushrooms, I suggest baking them alongside the chicken instead of on top. Also, if you're worried the recipe will have too much of a mustard taste, serve the extra sauce 'on the side'. Will definitely make this again!

It's a unique recipe- the sauce really is an odd mix of ingredients that combine into a nice flavour- but not stellar. This chicken is a nice change but not spectacular, and certainly not for the health-concious.

Great recipe! I don't really like mustard and was very skeptical when making it but the flavors blend into something unique and unexpected

These are one of those dishes that I'll make for special nights due to the nutrition value.  But wow!! we thought this was great, I did use dijon mustard and just brushed the chicken breast lightly with coating reserving the rest for the guest to add on to at their own personal preference.  They loved it.  Thanks so much for the post.

Wasn't quite as good as I was hoping, given all the great reviews of this. Not sure if it was the mustard I used or the chicken coming out a bit more dry than I liked (would be my fault obviously) But , it wasn't great, but simply good. My wife really enjoyed it and has requested I make it again. Not a house staple, but will be made again.

Really good recipe. I make extra honey-mustard sauce then what the recipe calls for, I almost double it and put more over the chicken and have extra to serve with at the table.

Amazing!! We all absolutely loved this! Didn't change a thing!! The chicken was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The crisp bacon and melted cheese were perfect! The honey mustard alone is an awesome recipe that we will keep using. I made some for my elderly neighbor who came back and asked for the recipe for the delicious chicken. I served it with mashed potatoes and homemade yeast rolls. AMAZING!

Made this tonight for my hubby and 15 month old. I omitted the mushrooms because we didn't have any on hand (and don't really like them anyway). Hubby loved it, and baby gobbled it down. Will definitely make again.

This is my husband's favorite thing to order when we go to a certain restaurant.  A bit heavy for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  I cheated and used bottled honey mustard sauce and tried to cut down on some of the calories where I could.  Not something I'd make all the time, but a pretty good recipe that tastes just like the original (or so I've been told!)

I also had really high hopes for this recipe due to the ratings and great ingredients listed.  I found it too sweet, dry, and actually boring. I will not make it again.

If I could give this 10 stars I would, even my boyfriend (who hates anything honey) LOVED it.  He actually thought it was a hollandaise sauce!  Quick trip to a heart attack but worth it!

I really liked this recipe. My husband just thought it was ok because his chicken was overdone. I used low fat mayo and you couldn't even tell the difference.I served it over brown rice, and the rice soaked up all the extra mustard sauce--which tasted excellent.

Oh my goodness! This was delicious! Tasted just like something you would order at a restaurant, and was pretty simple too. I followed other reviewers suggestions and didn't add the corn syrup, I used dijon mustard since that's what I had on hand, and garlic flavored poultry seasoning instead of the seasoned salt. My boyfried raved about the meal and asked me to be sure to hold on to this recipe. Thanks for posting!

This dish was fantastic!  My wife does not care for chicken, and even she said it was one of the best meals she has had in a while.  I did not have onion flakes, so I put in a pinch of garlic powder instead.  I stuck to the rest of the recipe exactly, and it turned out great.  It was easy to prepair and the honey mustard sauce is better than I have had at several nice restaraunts.

Pretty good overall.  The sauce just wasn't the same as the real dish at Outback.  Too sweet.

Absolutely delicious!! I made it for my father-in-laws birthday supper with Mouthwatering Stuffed Mushrooms and Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes. I can imagine putting the sauce on any number of meats... can't wait to try this with pork! I wish I had remember to take a picture it looked spectacular! Oh I also didn't flatten the chicken to 1 in thickness because the chicken was frozen and I don't have a pounder but it worked fine.

I was disappointed.  There were too many flavors that didn't seem to blend well.  I found the prep time to be longer than a half hour, and after all the effort, it was just an "ok" meal.  I will probably not make this again.  Sorry!

This was okay, I didn't think that the ingredients really went well together. Also I omitted the corn syrup but still found it much too sweet.  I probably won't make it again but it was nice to try something new and different.

This chicken has an awesome flavor, is super-moist, and is something I will definitely be making again.  I omitted the corn syrup in this recipe.  It did not taste like anything we had ever eaten at a restaurant, but still we loved our meal.  I served it with a simple salad. Thank you!

I omitted the corn syrup and used bacon bits instead of regular bacon to cut some of the fat out of this dish.  I thought it was okay but everyone else gobbled it up.

While this was good - I don't necessarily
know if I would make it again.  Did not
get a big "WOW" from the family.  We don't eat mushrooms, so I replaced with sauted onions.

I am just a learner, but wow.  It's not only a really easy recipe to follow, it's way better than the restaurant that it compares to.  I added mashed potatoes and broccoli and it was phenomenal.  If you want to impress guests, this is the way to go.

I def. LOVE this!!! 
One of the best recipes I have found. I did make some modefications...
I fried the bacon on the stove top, then used the bacon grease to cook the mushrooms on high heat. It gaved the mushroms a bacon taste to it. I put together the recipe as normal and added green onions for flavor and color. I finished it off with Mozzarella cheese and a little of Light Cheddar.
Sides, I nice crispy salad with honey mustand dressing, tomatoe and basil tear and share bread and couscous.

Oh my goodness, this recipe was to die for!!! Normally, my family doesnt care for breast meat because it has a tendency of being dry. Yet with this dish the meat was so tender and juicy. And that sauce!! I have to admit I was a bit nervous when I saw that we had to use mayo but again I was pleasantly surprised. We had wild rice and we put some of the honey mustard sauce on top of the rice. Yum!!! Even my 6 yr old was impressed!

Very tasty.  I didn't use the mushrooms (we don't like them).  I used Tyson frozen chicken breasts (the kind in the bag).  I browned the chicken in the bacon grease for about 20 minutes total.  Baked for 30 minutes.  I used minced onion and it seemed to be a little much, will cut back or omit completely next time.

I feel as if I was the last person in the world that hadn't prepared this dish. That all changed tonight. I cut back on the corn syrup and omitted the mushrooms and browned the chicken in the bacon grease. This was very good. My teenage son loved it. I thought it was a little too rich for me but a nice change. Thank you.

No honey?  No bacon?  No onion flakes?  No Problem.  I was missing three of these ingredients but I used a few substitutions and it turned out delicsious!  Instead of honey I used a half cup of dark brown sugar with 3T of water.  Instead of bacon I used bacon bits and since it was around Thanksgiving instead of using dried onion flakes I sprinkled some crushed french fried onions!  It turned out awesome!

Very nice! Chicken cooked beautifully and was very tasty. I used bacon bits instead of the rashes and I think that made it easier to eat. Could put more mushrooms with it if you love mushrooms - they tend to be overpowered. I also didn't use as much cheese to cut down on fat and still tasted great!
Bit too rich for everyday cooking but great as a show-off piece!

I made a few substitutions, based on what I had available. The results were good, but not great. I used low fat mayo in the sauce, which is VERY sweet. I didn't have season salt, and didn't use bacon. Nevertheless, my husband did really seem to enjoy this. I think I just had higher expectations.

I actually liked this more as a leftover than the night I cooked it.  I really don't like any dish as a main dish that's sweet.  Apparently, no one else in my family does either because it wasn't not a hit.

This recipe is DELISH! The chicken turned out so moist and tender. What a yummy entree! The honey mustard sauce gets baked in, so it isn't overpowering if you don't like honey mustard much. But if you do, then there's the extra honey mustard to dip it in! I skipped the refrigeration part as I didn't have time (what does that do anyway?) and I used regular boneless skinless breasts, not pounded thin - cooked a bit longer.

Delicious!  I used store-bought honey-mustard instead of making my own sauce and didn't have any mushrooms around, but this still tasted great.  My  roommate was impressed and there were barely any leftovers for me to take to work the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

Whole family loved this recipe!  I used carmelized onions in place of mushrooms, since we're not mushroom fans, and used a combination of shredded mild cheddar, sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, since it's all I had.  Also used Grey Poupon mustard, and sauce was just right for dipping.  Will use correct cheese next time, but it was absolutely delicious with the substitute! Thanks for sharing...

Wow, we made this last night and are just completely bewildered by all the rave reviews out there.  We were not that impressed and I followed the recipe exactly.  The honey mustard was WAY to sweet and overpowered the flavors of the chicken, bacon, and mushrooms.  We all (4 kids, and mom and dad) thought it was a waste of chicken and yummy bacon.  It was definitely edible and we did finish dinner, but this is definitely one that we won't be making again.

I needed to find something different to make for a dinner I was doing for my inlaws.  I made this chicken dish with wild rice and steamed baby veggies and it was a huge hit!  This recipe is superb!! I have shared it with several friends and they have all told me they loved it - wouldn't change a thing.

As we sat down to eat dinner, we were all anticipating what this dish would taste like.  We weren't dissapointed!  We all thought we could be at a restaurant having dinner.  This was really fairly easy to make.  I thought I could make this using smaller pieces of chicken for a party.  But the flavor was just perfect.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe at all, except maybe baking it longer.  I will make this one again, Hubby said "dont' loose this recipe".  Thank you !

If you are looking to make chicken with a 'twist' definitely try this recipe!  It combines the sweetness of honey-mustard with the savory flavors of bacon and cheese.  I absolutely love this recipe and I know that it will become a regularly served dish in our home.

my husband loves it though he doesn't like mustard. the sauce went well with chicken and mushroom. I didn't have bacon on hand, so I omitted that. And I sauteed the mushroom before assembling them on chicken. Delicious and easy recipe, even for novice cook.

I tried this recipe last night and it was soooooooo good.  My 10 year old daughter kept dipping her finger in the remaining sauce while the dish was in the oven.  I omitted the mushrooms since my family doesn't eat them.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again.

LOVED this dish!  I left out the mushrooms because I don't care for them, and substitued lite sour cream for the mayo in the honey mustard to cut down on fat.  My husband and I both loved this and have had it several times!

I didn't even make it, a friend did, so I got on this site to hunt it down.

I don't even like mustard!!!  And this stuff was SO good.

My friend didn't have the corn syrup or the onion flakes.  Never missed them.

Served this tonight...beautiful colors in this dish...perfect for fall.  I did not change a thing...except instead of season salt I used a chicken rub I already had on hand that had a little more kick to it.  Turned out wonderful.  My husband even used some bread to sop up all the left over sauce.

Well, Alice Springs Chicken is my FAVORITE!  However, I wasn't as impressed with this clone.  I didn't like the honey mustard sauce.   And it just wasn't as good as the restaurant.  I might give it one more try someday...but I'm not running to make it again.

I am trying to remove some of the fat and calories from our diet, so I made this recipe with turkey bacon and low fat cheese, and it was still wicked good!  I can only imagine how delightful it must be the other way.

This is Awesome! I did as other reviewers suggested and halved the sauce ingredients, then put half of that on the chicken, and served the rest for dipping.  I  also sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon drippings, and didn't use as much salt as called for.  Very yummy!

Excellent!  I made only half the sauce (as a few other reviews suggested)and it was the right amount for us. Will definitely make again. A great dinner party chicken.

The sauce is delicious.  I omitted the bacon and used onions instead. Only because we don't like bacon.  Good recipe.  Thanks.

This was just ok.  The sauce was too sweet for my family's taste and all the toppings seemed to get hard on top of the chicken.

After passing this recipe up over and over, I finally put it together and it was just awesome!!  The combination of ingredients works extremely well together.  It's full of sweet/savory flavor and you'd never know it's an ordinary chicken breast underneath!  It is a very rich dish so I don't make it too often but it is definitly a keeper.  Thank you!!

I made this for a dinner party of 12. It was a BIG hit. I tripled the recipe, so I my total amount of mustard was 1 cup; I substituted 1/3 of this with Dijon mustard. It gave it a nice kick.  I lightly browned the chicken the night before and cooked the mushrooms.  I marinated the browned chicken in some of the sauce overnight. When it came time to cooking the chicken, I placed it on a cookie sheet and cooked it until almost done. Then I put the toppings on and continued cooking it until cheese was melted. It was easy and delicious. I warmed up the sauce and served it on the side.  My guests were practically drink it!  Thanks you for the recipe!

Great recipe! I didn't have bacon on hand so I omitted that and it still turned out wonderful.  I took the advise of others and started the chicken on the George Foreman Grill.  It's a keeper... Thanks!

The bacon stayed crispy and the chicken was nice and tender!  I am not a big fan of honey mustard, but I did use a bit of it just to see and I actually enjoyed it!  Will make again!

Wonderful!  My family thought they had died and gone to Outback!  The only change I made was to use onion powder instead of onion flakes.  Awesome recipe!!!

Changed 2 things.  Used onion pwd in-place of flakes with great results.  Not so great was that I used thin chicken breast fillets and they dried out.  I'll stick to pounding-out the fillets next time.  I lied.  I added more bacon and sauted garlic also. Yum!

This was so good.  I served it for company, and they all requested the recipe.  I did not add the bacon, and I sauteed the mushrooms before cooking.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!  10 stars!!  This is one of the BEST recipes I've tried on this site!  EXACTLY like the chicken at the famous Aussie restaurant!!!  The sauce was EXCELLENT...the only thing was the mayonaise didn't blend well so it looked weird, but tasted GREAT!!  Not the healthiest meal, but WOW, what a treat!!  Moist chicken, sweet sauce, crispy bacon, yummy mushrooms...who could ask for anything more?!

This was an excellent dish.  Very easy to prepare.  Instead of using regular mustard, I used a dijion mustard to add some spice and freshly chopped onions instead of the flakes.  Will use again and again!

This was a nice change from our normal chicken recipes.  Instead of frying the chicken in vegetable oil, I used the same pan that I fried the bacon in and left some of the bacon grease.  It really added a good flavor.  I also add green onion to the top.  I served with flavored noodles.

This is one of the best ways to fix chicken.  We all love it.  I fix it at least once a month.  I recommend this dish to any one who likes flavorful ,moist chicken.

My BF and I love this recipe - it's earned a regular rotation spot for dinner.  The flavor is incredible and the leftovers taste just as good !  The only change we make is to use whole button mushrooms instead of fresh.

Amazing.  My family and I enjoyed this meal and it was easy to make.  We've cooked it twice and the second time I used all the sauce to bake with and my family enjoyed it more than having the dipping sauce.

This is the best chicken dish I've ever made!  I cooked the chicken in some of the bacon grease (since this was already not a low-fat dinner) and hat to use jack and cheddar (didn't have colby on hand). I highly recommend!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Just make sure the chicken isn't frozen when you put it in the dish.  Mine was and my cheese turned to soup because of the moisture coming out of the chicken as it thawed.  It was still really good though!

Try not to overcook the chicken, it can become dry.  I'll try chopping bacon next time.  Sauce smelled really mustardy but it wasn't..it was great!

This recipe is great. I made half the amount for my husband and I, and it tasted wonderful. I made some minor changes that include forgetting to put the parsley in the end. I also substituted the bacon with cooked shrimp, adding them in the last 9 minutes with some extra sauce. I also sautéed some onion and garlic instead of the onion flakes. Served it with grilled veggies and rice. I like the recipe because the taste is not too sweet and the mustard not too strong. Its just right, Thank you for sharing :D

The honey-mustard sauce in this dish is, very simply, not good. It has no flavor and I would not serve it to a dinner guest in my home. The amount of sugar used in this dish is absurd. The method for cooking the chicken is excellent however and the bacon and cheese saved this dish from the dog's bowl. It doesn't make sense that this recipe would be rated so highly.

Wow, this recipe was great! I substituted in Oscar Mayer pre-cooked baccon (lower in fat) and also low fat cheese and it still turned out fantastic. Hubby loved it too.

This is quite probably the best way to prepare chicken.  Save time by slicing through the chicken breast to the appropriate thickness instead of pounding it. By precooking the seasoned chicken pieces and freezing them; and doing the same with the bacon, you've got the makings for a really quick meal.
Grated fresh onion works as well as dried flakes, and any cheddar works.
MY, this is a good recipe!

This is foolproof! This recipe is so very easy and turns out absolutely wonderful! My boyfriend and I made it for a special dinner and were very impressed. I made it for my parents soon after, and my mom passed out the recipe at her work! I used a dijon mustard the first time and tried a sweet onion one next time, customize it with the mustard flavor you would like for chicken!

Bravo ! Bravo ! Must try this recipe. My husband is NOT a chicken eater at all, and he wanted seconds! The honey mustard sauce gives it so much flavor along with the bacon, shrooms and cheese. This is excellent. Thanks for such a great recipe. Will be making it many more times to come!!!

This was delicious! I had a nice butcher and he pounded the chicken breasts for me. The only change I made was to use a little Montreal Steak seasoning as well as the seasoned salt. My hubby doesn't always comment on the new dishes I make but he said, "This is good...this is SO good!" Thanks Rebecca for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe. Everyone in my house wouldnt shut up about it for hours. I didnt use season salt..instead  i did my own seasoning. I also didnt pound the chicken but  i dont think it matters because the chicken was soooo moist and soft. I loved it, Im making it again tonight.

Pretty darn yummy.  My husband usually scarfs down his dinner without saying much but after about two bites of the Aussie Chicken he said "This is really good!  Where'd you get the recipe?"  ;)

This recipe was truly a hit in my house! My husband loved it and I ate it two days in a row. It was even better today...I
I actually lightened up the recipe when I made it only because I am watching my calories. I used 4 chicken breasts but I used 3 slices of low fat Turkey bacon, light mayo, 1 cup of cheese, tons more mushrooms, added some onions, didn't use the oil, and used only half the amounts of corn syrup, mayo and honey. It still turned out DELICOUS!
 I put it over a Ceasar Salad with homemade croutons with the leftovers today for lunch and it was wonderful.
Great recipe!

Outstanding -- delicious taste -- all the ingredients blend perfectly.  Only mistake I made to "save time" -- I didn't pound the chicken breasts -- you MUST pound the chicken -- next time, I will.

At first, I was not too sure about the honey mustard sauce.  But my family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  This was a restaurant quality and is definitely a keeper.

This was the first meal I prepared for the guys on shift. Feeding 10 guys as a rookie Firefighter is nerve-wrecking. After everything was done and said, bellies and spirits were delighted. Excellent recipe!

Delicious!! I used low fat mayo and turkey bacon (to make a little healthier) and it was great.  I'll definitely be making this again and again!

Prepared this exactly as directed but rather than putting it over pasta, used rice instead.  Was fantastic and made it as gift for new neighbors who were thrilled with it.

There is nothing like deciding to make a recipe, then not having the proper ingredients in your pantry!  As others suggested--this recipe is great wihtout substitutions--but with the following alterations, it turned out great and is an easy to fix weeknight meal.  I used whole grain balsamic mustard instead of prepared and I used boysenberry syrup since I was out of corn syrup--I also used bagged 5 blend cheese and chicken tenders instead of breast..great recipe!

My husband cooked this for me because its my favirote at a certain resturant. I thought it was great. He made a mess I'm sure would have been cut in half, had I made it, but even for him it was easy and fairly quick. I wasnt thrilled with the sauce though, i think it has a little too much mustard taste compared to resturant. OVERALL WONDERFULL! THANKS FOR SHARING

This dish is excellent Rebecca! My family and I loved it.  Only used half the sauce but can use the other half for dipping or even combine with warm bacon for a delicious spinach salad dressing.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm sure this is a 5 star recipe though it was hard for me to decide. I think I expected it to be over the top, out of this world, would eat it every day if I could...But thats what I get for expecting that much. It always takes away from it when you expect the extremes. My husband wasn't expecting...soooo I ask him and he said -"I LOVED IT!, IT'S LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D GET IN A FINE RESTAURANT!!!" So there ya' go*****5 stars!***** Thanks Rebecca!

This recipe is awesome and very easy to make!  To cut down on the calories I used light mayo, turkey bacon and fat free cheese and it still tasted delicious! I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it!  I did do a few things differently from the recipe. I cooked the bacon in the microwave, faster and less grease.  I also cooked the chicken on my George Forman grill instead of pan frying them, they were still very moist and it took very little time to cook.  I also sauted my mushrooms before assembling the chicken dish.  We saved the extra honey mustard and my daughter used it to dip chicken tenders in later that week.

I give this 4 stars and really liked it. My husband hates Mayo and said that it was too strong in this recipe. He gave it 0 stars!! Maybe I can find a good substitute next time, so he'll like it more...

Great combination of flavors. I waited until about 10 minutes before taking it out of the oven to put my shredded colby on. I used morel mushrooms and it turned out wonderful. This is just like Outback Steakhouse's Alice Springs Chicken. Thanks for the recipe. We'll definately use it again!

This was very good! Will save this for an occasional treat. Sits pretty heavy.  I cooked 2 breasts for hubby and myself, so I halved everything.  Also used only 1/4 of the sauce.  I made this in one pan.  Cooked the chicken in bacon grease, didn't notice the flavor to be over powering, but I love bacon.  Clean up and preparation were extremely easy.  Had no problem with 15 minute cooking time since the breasts are pounded thin, and pre-cooked.  May take longer if you don't pound the chicken to 1/2" thickness?  VERY GOOD. GO AHEAD AND TRY IT.

This recipe was great.  I made it for a formal valentines dinner.  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed is I cut the amount of honey-mustard sauce in half.  We just didn't use all the extra.

I have made this dish for my family and my Dad.  Everyone loves it.  I do cut down on the honey-mustard sauce a bit and use as much bacon as I want to (I buy the pre-cooked and just crisp it up).

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe.  The
proportions seemed to be all out of wack - a
bit shy on bacon, *way* too much honey mustard
sauce and way too much cheese.  My chicken
breasts were not even close to cooked in 
15 minutes - be careful.  Finally, the taste
was only average to start, and it made us a 
bit "green" as we tried to finish a single
chicken breast.

Very good! The honey mustard sauce is perfect. We omitted the bacon because neither of us care for it much, but it was still great without it.

Other than leaving out the mushrooms, I followed this recipe to a T.  I am so disappointed, because this dish was just NOT for us.  Frankly, it was a shameful waste of a lot of ingredients. I was so looking forward to enjoying this dish, but I'll be deleting it from my recipe box.

I made this as the main dish for a Valentine's dinner for my girlfriend. Without question, one of the best chicken recipes I have tasted. The honey mustard sauce is amazing! My girlfriend loved this and I will be making this again. To save a little time, I would suggest shredding the cheeses and making the sauce before hand and putting in the fridge. Great recipe!

Yum! This is a simple and tasty dish.  I ended up with a lot more of the mustard mixture than I needed so I will probably 1/2 it next time.  Also didn't have time to sit for 1/2 hour with seasoned salt but it still came out great.  A keeper!

Delicious! Didn't change a thing. My husband keeps saying it's the best chicken he's ever had. I thought it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I reserved half of the sauce for dipping, but next time, I'll just cook all of the sauce with the chicken.

Wonderful - absolutely WONDERFUL!  My husband (whose a picky eater) loved this.  I'm in England and I've never heard of light corn syrup so I used golden syrup instead.  I also used half French's burger mustard and half English mustard (the very hot kind). Taking the recommendation of other cooks I reduced the bacon to 1 slice per chicken breast and chopped it up.  I also sauted the sliced mushrooms with a quarter of a finely chopped onion and one small crushed garlic clove.  I used a strong cheddar cheese and it wasn't overpowering. (You can't get the recommended cheese over here).  This will be a very regular guest at our dinner table.  Served with buttered new potatoes and broccoli.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any corn syrup so i used more honey instead, and it worked great both times! I definitely will use this over and over.

Made this for my picky husband and he liked it.  Will definitely do this again.  I didn't chop up the cooked bacon.  I just placed the bacon on top of the chicken in strips.  Next time I'll chop it up so that it doesn't have as strong a bacon taste.  You'll love it if you're a bacon lover.

I have made this numerous times now for my family and we love it!  

I don't usually plan ahead very well, so I don't do the seasoning salt step.  I also don't like mushrooms, so I leave those out.  It always tastes wonderful!  It's easy too!

We have tried it with mozzarella cheese and also cheddar.  Yummy as usual!

I thought that the flavor combination was off.  The season salt is over the top and ruins the dish for me.  I'm not sure how this made the hall of fame.

This recipe was awesome.  I left out the bacon because we're not big bacon fans.  I used the leftover sauce for a mushroom dish the next day.  Yum

Very tasty. 5 stars.  My family enjoyed Aussie Chicken, and I will definitely keep this recipe.  However, I probably won't make it very often because of the high fat content.

This turned out really good. I didn't use as much sauce as it called for, and used ranch as a dipping sauce instead.

My family seemed to enjoy this, I thought it was just ok.  One thing I will not do again (if I make it) is fry the chicken in the bacon grease.  It just gave it way too much bacon flavor.  The Outback version is definitely much better.

I was disappointed that this recipe didn't turn out as wonderful as I expected from the reviews.  The topping on the chicken was the best part -- I sauteed the mushrooms and onion (instead of onion flakes) in the bacon grease, and it was delicious with the bacon and cheese.  I found the honey mustard sauce too cloying, so next time I will use my favorite honey mustard recipe, which makes the chicken very flavorful and tender: 1/2 c. honey, 1/2 c. dijon mustard, 2 T. lemon juice, 1 t. salt.  This marinade works best if you completely oven-bake the chicken, without pan-frying first.  (Add the toppings during the last 15 minutes.)

I guess my family isn't much on honey mustard sauce. Also, time consuming to make and so will not make again.

This is a good recipe.  i was looking for something different i could try using chicken breasts.  I have made this twice with only moderate changes: no seasoning salt or refrigeration prior to cooking chicken, no dried onion flakes, substituted light brown sugar for honey(I was out), and no cheese(once) and the dish was still good.  I've also used the dressing recipe with homemade chicken strips.  My family devoured them!!
I will definately add to my recipe box.

Thanks!!

I had plenty of ingredients left over. I think I could have gotten away with only using half the amount of cheese, bacon, mushrooms and honey mustard sauce. Seemed to be a waste to prepare all the extra ingredients and only use a small portion of them. Otherwise, the meal was very good.

Great recipe! But it took me more than 25 minutes to prepare more like an hour to get every thing read. I tried it with the teriyaki sauce like HESSELMJ's mom did and it was great. I also thought the chese was alittle over the top, too many flavors going on. Overall great dish.

Excellent!!! Missed the part of pounding down the breasts so mine took longer to bake than 15 minutes in the oven. Also, I didn't have parsley on hand and still was delicious.

Very similar to the Alice Springs.  I used 1/2 dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard.  Next time I will try the plain yellow only, as it was a little spicy with so much dijon.  I made a baked potato with sour cream and cheese on the side, along with sesame seed green beans.  It all looked so beautiful and it was delicious!  Not too healthy so I gave it 4 stars.

FANTASTIC!!  Made this for dinner and my husband just loved it.  I did not use mushrooms as he does not like them and used less cheese.  Next time I wont make as much sauce it really does make too much.  Can't wait to have people over for dinner so I can make it again.

This was a awesome dinner.  I made it for company and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing it took more time then what is stated to brown the chicken.  Even though you brown it and then put it in the oven it is very moist.  The honey mustard sauce is excellent.

Excellent Recipe!  The chicken needs to be seasoned with something more than just seasoned salt.  It needs some more zip.  I might try adding some more pepper etc... next time.  Great recipe though.

Excellent! So many chicken recipes are usually so bland. This isn't the healthiest, but a great treat once in while. Thanks for sharing.

I have used many recipe's  here and love this site. BUT this is the first time I have ever felt the need to rate something. All I have to say is, I will have to keep myself from making this chicken at least 3 times a week. Thank-you so much for this Rebecca.

This is a terrific recipe.  I made it for a friend of ours and all he could say was, "This makes my taste buds SING!" It's become one of our family favorites.  In fact, I'm making it tomorrow for my mom's birthday.  Thanks Rebecca for sharing this!

We all loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed, was using Dijon mustard rather than prepared, and I briefly sauteed the mushrooms.  It was very filling, but it was delicious.

Bravo! Hubby loves it. I made some minor adjustments as I don't have some ingredients: light maple syrup instead of corn syrup and Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really tasty but the next time I make it it will be with Coleman's mustard. I used a generic 'spicy brown mustard,' and I wasn't terribly keen on the taste. Getting the mustard flavor is important for this recipe, and I know Coleman's will be just right. Thanks for sharing, Rebecca!

This was absolutely the best.  It's just as good as the restaurant! After reading the reviews I knew it would be good, just not as good as it turned out.  I thought the amount of sauce was just right.

This is delicious, and so easy to prepare. The honey mustard sauce is perfect for dipping anything into it....chicken fingers, pretzels, and even spread it on sandwiches.

This recipe is simply outstanding!  It's definitely restaurant quality and easy to make.  Theres a little more honey mustard sauce than you really need but other than that I would recommend this to anyony who wants to see empty dinner plates at the table.  I served with baked sweet potatoes and green beans with garlic sauce.  Try it you'll love it.

My husband loved this recipe and wanted to make it for company.  I liked it but it wasn't one of my favourites as I am not a huge fan of mustard.  I think I might try it next time with dijon mustard instead.

My husband enjoyed this, which was good, because he had to eat all the leftovers. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. I may try again with modifications, but I've definitely had better chicken dishes.

I am so full.... we ate it all!  I also cooked the chicken in a small reserve of the bacon grease for 5 minutes on each side.  I did this ahead of time and found that I needed to cook the chicken for about 30 minutes in the oven - maybe because it had cooled off.  I loved the honey mustard sauce... I will make this again!

I thought this recipe was good but not great. I would maybe try using Dijon mustard next time instead of regular. I'll probably make this again but it won't be a regular.

My friend made this last night for a small gathering...and it was the most amazing chicken I have ever had.  It was very rich, but just the right balance between sweet and savoury.  I intend to make it myself in the near future...and will probably put up another rave review.

This goes VERY well with a small appetizer salad, and stuffed portabella mushrooms on the side.

Awesome meal!  We loved it.  Made it w/out the onions, and it didn't need it.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and browned the chicken breasts and mushrooms in the bacon grease (vs. veg oil) before baking.  Also, used dijon mustard vs. regular yellow.

WONDERFUL!!!  I made this for my family the other night and they all loved it! With three boys, it is always hard to please them all. The only thing that I changed is that I used less of the honey mustard sauce. But we all LOVED it! Will made again and again. Thanks!

This recipe is really good but tastes a little to heavy.  My husband and kids thought it was a little much.  Maybe less sauce would make it a little lighter.

My husband and I don't like chicken very much but with the price of beef these days it's all I can afford. The only variation I did to this recipe was to add garlic; we love garlic. I found it to be a little salty, other than that it was delicious. Hubby said I can make it again, I said it's so easy, he can :)

The chicken was very tender but I did not care for the sauce at all.  Overall the comination of flavors just didn't work well together.  Reminded me of something from a fast food/diner restaurant.

My family loved this recipe.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I wasn't crazy about the honey mustard sauce.  I thought it was to runny and sweet.  I was hoping for it to be more like the outback sauce.  Next time I will try using less honey.  I will make this again...this is a keeper!!!!

Yum!  I had to make some substitutions - onion powder instead of onion flakes, canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon - but it still turned out great.  Chicken was very moist.  Next time, I'm going to make it with all the right ingredients, but YUM!

My rating is based purely on preference. I did not personally like the taste (but I image others would). Also,  I had to cook the chicken and the bacon in pans before combining together which took too much time and caused a lot of dirty dishes -- something I don't care for especially when I end up not liking the flavor.

Awesome chicken recipe.  I made this for my brother's birthday dinner and everyone loved it.  While I will give this 5 stars, next time (and it will be soon) I'm going to use a honey mustard recipe for this same chicken that I have found on a couple of other sites - dijon mustard, honey, veg. oil, lemon juice...just to see how it tastes.  Will make again and again!  Thanks.

This dish was good, but not amazing.  I didn't pound the chicken into thin pieces and it took A LOT longer to cook.  I think this made the sauce more runny than it's supposed to be.

My husband and I both thought this was very good.  To save time, I used the pre-cooked bacon.  I also used 1/4 cup of regular prepared mustard & 1/4 cup of dijon mustard as other reviewers had suggested.  Very good recipe!

All my family liked this recipe...definitely a keeper.  The sauce was a little sweet so I won't use as much corn syrup next time (or not at all, the honey is enough)....otherwise, perfect.

This was good recipe and was really close to the restuarant style that is one of my favorite things to order there. It was very flavorful, but maybe a bit too rich. Also I would cut the portion size down to roughly the size of a deck of cards. This recipe is something definetly worth trying.

We did not enjoy this dish at all.It was swimming in grease even after I omitted the bacon and cut the cheese in half.  The honey mustard sauce wasn't very good either.

Very average in my opinion.  I may have expected too much after reading all the great reviews.

I did not like this much. I thought it would be good based on all of the glowing reviews, but it was missing something. My husband ate it, but then he would eat whatever I put in front of him as long as it did not have peas ; ) But I will not be making this one again. I will also note though, I have had Outbacks Version and I did not care for that one either.

How good was this meal?  Well, "It smells like Friendly's in here!", exclaimed my children when entering our dining room.  Upon finishing their meals I was asked if I could prepare this meal every Wednesday.  Need I say more?

This was fabulous! Very filling. I used mozzerella cheese and had to cook it almost twice as long for the chicken to cook completely but it was well worth the wait!

I was looking for something new with a little pizzaz that was easy & quick to make.  This was a hit, especially with the husband!  It looked great on a plate and I would not hesitate to serve this to guests.  Also tasted great re-heated!

I'm an Australian and I have never had or heard of this 'Aussie Chicken' dish before. I am proud to have my nationality aligned with this recipe - it's fabulous!!! (despite the fact it's NOT Australian!).
The only change I made was using Golden Syrup instead of Corn Syrup. I couldn't find Corn Syrup anywhere and have no idea what it's suppose to taste like but the sauce was still yummy. My finace just loved it, thanks so much!

This is good, but rich.  I used pre-cooked bacon to cut down on the time which worked great.  I will definitely make again after the richness has worn off.

Tasty, but not what I was hoping it would be. Too much of a mustardy taste, I'm not big on mustard anyway. I would definitely cut the sauce in 1/2 especially if you cooking for two.

I love this recipe!  I served it at a dinner party and got nothing but compliments.  I was a little nervous about the amount of yellow mustard so I followed previous posters advice and used half dijon half yellow.  I also cooked the mushrooms in the bacon grease.  I have a tendency of over or under cooking chicken but this recipe made it easy.  The chicken turned out perfect.  Moist and done.  Thank you Rebecca!

WOW! This was easy to make and tasted fantastic! My family felt like they were dining at Alice Springs in Australia! And the best part was we were at home! Next time my husband wants to grill the chicken breasts over mesquite and brush the left-over sauce onto them while they cook. Sounds good! Only had 1/4 cup mustard so added 1/4 cup Grey Poupon Dijon mustard for the 1/2 cup mustard and it was VERY tasty! Other than that I followed it exactly and couldn't be more pleased. Great party dish! Nice presentation.

Very good recipe although I made a few changes because of the high fat and sodium content. These are my substitutions/ changes: I used light mayo, turkey bacon, only 1 cup reduced fat cheese, and only 1 tsp season salt. My husband and I enjoyed it!

Funny story here. When I added and mixed the mayo to the sauce with a fork, all I saw was white tiny lumps floating in the  mixture. I'm thinking,"Oh no, I messed this one up." LOL..However, I used a blender and the mayo disolved. I used 1/4c of mustard because the original recipe's amount made the mustard taste too strong. This chicken is really good but I will only make it once a year because it is tooooooooooooo fattening. All I can think of while eating it was clogged arteries. Again, it really taste good if you want to gain some weight.

This Aussie is going to be the hit at my son's wedding. I have fixed it for other people and they absolutely loved it. It's the best chicken I have ever tasted.

Yummy Yummy! Hope you like cheese and mushrooms. I added a little more bacon than it called for and made the bacon crispy. What a winner!

I had something similiar at a restaurant called Hirsch's and I tried to imitate it but this recipe is what I was looking for and loved it.  will make the sauce just for dipping also!!!! I use 3/4 cup honey mustard in place of mustard and honey and increased the mayo by 1/4 cup.GREAT!!

This was SO good, I did not have honey so I used Tastefully Simple's Honey Mustard sauce (which is kind of spicy) and it was excellent! Thanks for the delicious recipe! I will make this again and again!

Yum!  I wasn't sure what to serve at my dinner party, but I'm glad I picked this one!  Everyone loved it!  The honey mustard sauce really gives this chicken a suprise kick, great flavor.  If you like mushrooms, you can really pile them on because they shrink down quite a bit during cooking. I also cooked the bacon the night before in the oven (on a cookie sheet at 425 about 20 min.).  This helped cut down on time & grease during initial preparation.  Whole operation was a little time consuming, but end result well worth it. I'll definatly be making this one again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this without the bacon and it was really good.  It does have an interesting little touch to it, don't know if it was the seasoning salt or what.  OVerall good meal, real easy and good left overs.

Remade this without corn syrup and just cheddar cheese on top and it was very good sauce was great with baked potato

While trying to decide on what to prepare for supper last night I came across this recipe...  it is fantastic!!!  My husband is quite particular and he loved it!!!!  I did do a few modifications - no onion flakes - and I used "Real Bacon Bits" to aviod the huge amount of grease...  but, it was certainly another recipe to add to my book.... Thanks!!!! - NL.CAN.

it was alright.  The sauce was good.. really good concept.. but there was a lot of grease with that bacon and the whole meal was kinda heavy on my stomach.  Try the other chicken meal with the angel hair pasta, Italian dressing, and cream of mushroom.

Delicious! Superb! My fiance loved this recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added a bit more corn syrup to the sauce so it wouldn't be as spicy.  I will definately make this again!

The bacon and honey dijon were good complements.  Salty and sweet.  yummy. I used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup (I was out)and it turned out just fine.

I was confused when eating this chicken cause I could taste every ingrediant, it was kind of wierd. i would have liked the honey mustard sauce better without the onion flakes, i did not like those at all. I think next time i might use a little less honey cause i could really taste it and it did not go well with the bacon and onion flake flavors. This recipe has potential but i would change things around a bit, it was so rich and heavy, i could not eat the whole peice, i ate about 1/4 of it. I will try it agian but i will do it a little differently.

This was wonderful!  It was so rich though, so I didn't eat a lot (probably good, because very high in fat and calories).  I would probably crumble the bacon next time instead of laying pieces over the top of the chicken breast, would've been easier to eat.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  This is the only thing I've ever ordered from that restraunt I love it and had attempted to make before I found this recipe with no great success.  What a find!!!

Like others, I thought the sauce was too "mustardy". Next time I will reduce the mustard or use prepared honey mustard. Also I think sauteeing the mushrooms and using mozzarella cheese will add extra flavor.

This recipe was very good!  My husband and I enjoyed it, but my teenaged sons didn't find it appealing.  We are doing Atkins, and this was perfect except for the honey :)  (So we cheated a little)!  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my husband and mother-in-law a few weeks ago. It was a big hit with both of them. I enjoyed it also, but I think when I make it again I am going to do some changes ont eh sauce. It had too much of a mustard flavor and not enough sweetness. All in all it was a big hit! Thanks!

This was tasty, but not my favorite chicken recipe.  Maybe I did something wrong..just wasn't the biggest hit at our house.  I may try it again and try to perfect it, given that everyone has said such great things about it.

A good & easy recipe for chicken, something I get tired of trying to find new ways to jazz up. I didn't have the dried minced onions so instead I used onion & garlic powders. An easy, tasty, and eye appealing dish!

This is an awesome recipe. My husband is allergic to mayo so I used plain yogurt instead and added garlic powder to taste. Even the kids love it.

I was a little concerned about some of the ingredients, but thought I'd give it a shot after reading the reviews.  Glad I did - it is delicious.  Will not make too often because of the richness, but it certainly is a keeper.

I wasn't sure that this recipe would be good, but after I tried it I fell in love with it.  The complexity of the flavors is amazing and I couldn't wait to make it again.  I don't know how anyone could not love this dish.

This recipe makes the best honey mustard, I actually use it on other things all the time, try this honey mustard over scallops & bacon, it's great!

My husband was growing feathers from eating so much CHICKEN and was getting tired of the same old chicken recipes! To the rescue came "Aussie Chicken"! Great recipe. We both loved it. One note; don't overcook in the oven. It can get rubbery.

Wow. This was delicious. It was easy to do and oh-so-fattening. It was great. My whole family loved it...actually, my husband was upset with me because he was trying to diet and couldn't help but eat some of it.

I love this site! This was an excellent recipe.  I was getting bored with the same old chicken every week & this was such a pleasant suprise. My husband, who doesn't care for honey mustard sauce, even raved about it. This is my new favorite meal. Thank you.

My family thought that this was the best.  I made it with the garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  They gobbled it all up!  Is rather rich so won't be making this too often.

This chicken tasted excellent!  I've never tried the much talked about Outback version but if what this recipe creates is any indication, it should be a great dish.

This was fantastic!  It also looked as good as it tasted.  It wasn't the quickest meal to prepare but it was definitely worth it.  I used the bacon grease to saute my mushrooms and I didn't really notice a difference in taste.  I will make this over and over and over again.

This is one to make with company coming.  The ingredients are easy to get and easy to make but makes a lasting impression on the taste buds.  I use the pre-cooked bacon when I'm in a hurry.

I wonder what kind of food coconutpalm likes.  This is an awesome recipe that we first had at the Outback. (What is not to like there? Which is why I question coconutpalm's food tastes.  All those people standing and sitting waiting to get in at 5:30 and after could not all be wrong)  Try this recipe and I am sure you will enjoy it. It is a 'company dinner' favorite.

I want to say something nice about the final product of this recipe but I can't. We just didn't like it at all. But, I think the honey mustard part of this recipe is pretty good.

I know I'm definitely in the minority here but I was really disappointed with this dish. I was expecting spectacular results but didn't get them.  I followed several recommendations (pound chicken thin, saute mushrooms in bacon drippings, make half the sauce..) but this meal tasted almostbland....if that's possible with bacon, cheese, and honey-mustard.  The dressing was very good and I was glad to have enough to put on each bite. Call me crazy but I won't be making this one again.

This was okay; nothing spectacular.  Cheese and bacon seemed to overpower the whole dish.  Will not make again.

This was EXCELLENT!  What a way to zip up chicken, even my 4 year old loved it.
I did cut down on prep time by using the pre-cooked bacon.  Next time I think
I'll make rice or egg noodles and put  more of the honey mustard sauce on
it!  But thank you, thank you, thank you!

This is a great recipe, thanks Rebecca. Excellent flavour and we were able to put it together fairly quickly. A nice change for plain old skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Only alteration we would make next time would be to slightly pre-cook the mushrooms first in a pan with some butter. Thanks again!

We thought this was very good...not outstanding, but good.  A little salty.  Maybe less seasoning salt.

With my picky 5 kids this is a winner.  Grown-up taste that even kids like.  I do make some changes.  I use Oscar Mayer real bacon bits to save time.  I skip the mushrooms, use less cheese(just cover the top of the chicken), and do not usually have any sauce to reserve.  One of the kids often requests no sauce (just bacon and cheese).  Everyone is happy!

One of the best chicken dishes I have ever had, I made a big batch for my girlfriend and me thinking we would have left overs but we ate it all. The sauce has the perfect taste and texture.

Family LOVED this Chicken Dish! For the kids, I left off the mushrooms. Kids loved the mustard honey sauce. Husband said "I've gone to Heaven!" Can I ask. . .What restaurant serves a dish like this?  Thank you for the recipe.

Well, just the bacon would have been enough, but the mushrooms MAKE this dish.  I forgot to put the honey, and added it into the dipping sauce later, and that worked out nicely.  I also left out the mayo, but then made it again with it, and I actually like the recipe better without the mayo in the sauce.  Definitely a good one to add to the recipe collection...thanks!

My husband and I enjoyed this chicken recipe. I wanted to reduce the fat so I substituted Bacos for the bacon. He said it reminded him somewhat of Southern style barbecue sauce.

I liked this recipe but it was way too salty! I would make it again omitting the seasoned salt and maybe try a honey mustard dressing already prepared to make it quicker

Maybe I should try the meal from the restaurant first, but this wasn't worth the effort.  It made tons of dirty dishes and didn't taste that great.  I guess I'm the only one who didn't like it, according to the reviews.

This is absolutely wonderful!  But I made some slight revisions.  I halved the ingredients for the sauce.  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter with a little bit of wine.  And I used sliced swiss cheese and didn't add it while baking.  Once the chicken was done I turned off the oven and placed the sliced cheese on top.  Also, I cooked the chicken a little longer.

My girlfriend loves the orignal recipe from a restuarant that shall remain nameless and she couldn't believe how much it actually tasted like it!  I don't eat mushrooms, but enjoyed a few shroomless pieces myself.

We loved this chicken.  The sauce tasted great.  I'm not a big bacon fan so next time I'll probably make it without the bacon and I think it'll be just as good.

This was wonderful!  I used Oscar Myer Recipe Bacon Pieces for the bacon (found by croutons/bacon bits) to save myself from frying bacon.  That was a great idea!  I hate frying bacon, but love the taste it adds to the dish.  The bacon crisped right up in the oven and was delicious.  The sauce was superb.  The meal was also delicious as leftover lunch the next day.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipie for my husband and he loved it so much there were no leftovers! A little too much honey mustard sauce for 4 pieces of chicken so I saved it for dipping chicken fingers for another dinner. I bought thinly sliced chicken from the grocery store so I wouldn't have to pound it and this saved a lot of time. Very tasty, and more importantly very easy.

it seems like the sauce was too strong in flavor, also the chicken had to cook much longer - so i wished i hadn't cooked the bacon to the crispy stage as the recipe directed.

This was outstanding. I added extra mushrooms and I sauteed them with a teaspoon of butter and wine before combining them with the chicken. I did cut the honey mustard in half and still had too much to the point that I had t throw some away. I would make this again and again. Cory

This was one of those recipes that I could get the whole gang to eat.  I used Montery Jack instead of Swiss cheese.  I found that the recipe made alot of extra sauce. It wasn't wasted though because I used it on rice.

I started cooking about a month ago...as i normally buy pre-prepared meals...this was an excellent dish...even my picky 3 and 5 year old boys said it was the best. I made it a little lower in fat by using fat free mayo and turkey bacon.

This is very tasty and very rich (don't make it if you're looking for something "light" tasting).  I ended up using mozarella cheese because it's all I had in the fridge and it tasted great!  My older children and husband ate it but my 3 year old said it looked yucky so she wouldn't try it (which is nothing new!).  Will definitely make again.

This is great, a good change from savoury style chicken, I used grainy and pre-prepared mustard it gave a very nice look and texture.  The next time, I will substitue honey for corn syrup as my dressing was a bit too runny, and will use Chicken Thighs instead of breast..

Delicious! I cooked the bacon and mushrooms a few hours in advance, as well as making the sauce in advance. At dinnertime, I just had to deal with the chicken. My boyfriend loved it! Being vegetarian, I used the sauce on my salmon and it turned out beautifully.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  To make lower in fat and calories, I used low fat ham and grilled it instead of the bacon and I used ultra low fat mayo.

Amazing!  It's becoming one of my signature dishes and is even being requested by my guests before they come over.  I substitute dijon for regular mustard, and pancake syrup for corn syrup (just gives a little maple-y flavour, and it's pretty much the same consistancy).

This was sooooo good.  I used bottled honey mustard dressing and it was great.  This is a keeper.

PS - I used Dijon Mustard instead of plain mustard.  I beleive it made the sauce more like the restaurant's.

I was very excited to try this as I thought it would be similar to the "local well-known restaurant".  Sorry, didn't even come close.  The honey-mustard sauce was really way off.  Won't make this one again.

I tried this recipe last night for dinner. My husband and I LOVED this chicken. This sauce is delicious!! The only thing I changed is I sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter before adding them to the chicken. I did that because I like sauteed mushrooms and it turned our perfect.

Pretty good, hubby really liked it.  You could get away with probably half the sauce.  I think you could also make an easier honey mustard with just honey and mustard, leaving out the Karo and the onion powder.  Truthfully, I think there are better recipes for a pounded piece of chicken breast.

This was BY FAR the best recipe that I've tried in a long time.  The honey mustard was exquisite!  No more store bought for me.  The great thing was, I turned this into a lo-fat meal by using turkey bacon, 2% cheese and non-fat mayo in the dressing!  It was still deee-licious!

I loved this chicken.  It had a great flavor and even my picky husband like it.  (I left off the mushrooms)The only negative: It took longer than what I usually spend on a midweek dinner.

This is so AWESOME! My husband couldn't get enough of it.  However, I only put 1/8th cup of corn syrup and it was still too sweet.  So I added 1/4th cup dijon mustard and it was just right.  I think I will try it with premade honey mustard next time, to try and save time.  Definately a keeper.

Hello! Ive rated this recipe before and this is still my all-time favorite! I wanted to see what other people thought of it and a few mentioned about having too much sauce, what you do with that extra sauce is pour it over another dish such as potatoes, i highly reccommend roasted garlic apple potatoes which can be found here as well. Pour the leftover sauce from the aussie chicken onto the potatoes....it is to die for! I usually have to make a bit more sauce than usual because everyone puts it on their potatoes as well!

Disappointed!!  I read all the reviews only a couple didn't like it.  Well add me to that list.  I'm not a picky eater but this wasn't as great to me as all of you raved.  I followed the  recipe as stated.  Not a pleasent taste. I love honey mustard on my salads but I will never attempt this recipe again.  With all the effort used to prepare this, the end product made me a little angry!!

I find one or two new recipes a year that get me a big thumbs up from my husband - and one worked.
Very delicious, though I did have to cook it for longer than the suggested time.  My 15 month old son couldn't get enough of it either :)
I prepared the honey mustard sauce,browned the chicken, sliced the mushrooms and cooked the bacon ahead of time.  So when dinner time came, I only had to assemble and put it in the oven - which works well for those whose supper time is the busiest time!
