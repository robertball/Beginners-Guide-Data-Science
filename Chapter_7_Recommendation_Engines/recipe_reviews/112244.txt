I made this for my mom birthday. Everyone loved it!!! It tasted more like icecream than mousse.

I made this dessert for Easter & forgot to serve it. Please tell me I am not the only one who habitually does that! ;o) Hubby & I enjoyed it once it had thawed some but we didn't really care for it as a frozen cake.  I added a bit extra candy to the crust & baked it for about 10 minutes (before adding the mousse of course) to help it hold together. I used finely crushed candy to cover the cake, then piped on the whipped cream & used coarsely crushed candy to garnish the puffs of whipped cream. Thansk for a tasty recipe Kathleen...I'm sure my guests would have loved it. LOL

Tasted great.  I made the mistake of taking it out of freezer and letting it chill in fridge too long, to avoid tasting like lemon ice cream as previsouly stated, and it was "lemon soup."  So in other words, serve it frozen!  Will make again!

Takes some work, but well worth it for lemon lovers!  I made this for a large crowd over the summer and it was great!  A very refreshing summer dessert.  Freezes well, but is best the first time you serve it.  I found after freezing for a while, the whipped cream layer wasn't as good.

This was a delicious dessert!  Thank you for sharing.  The mousse part was perfect.  I followed the recipe as is, except the grocery store had green lemons, I only had 1/2 of one at home, plus I picked up another one.  I didn't measure the lemon juice, just used the juice from 1-1/2 lemons, then added 4 drops of real lemon oil from a Health Food store.  I didn't have a springform pan so I used two 9" pie pans, used a whole box of the vanilla wafers (probabaly around 75 and FYI I'd call these cookies if it didn't say wafers on the box) and added a bit more butter to the base to make two bases.  There was enough filling and whip cream in this recipe to make into two pies, about 1" deep.  I almost only gave it 4 stars because of two things: (I think these are just personal preferences)  A) I didn't like the hard candy crunchy texture.  I put the hard candies in the food processor, so the pieces were quite fine.  Maybe that didn't help.  (The candies were also hard to find, who would have known?)  B)  I served it frozen and  before I froze it, it was a wonderful thick consistency.  It was still delcious frozen, and would be amazing on a hot summer day, I might try it again but plan on serving in individual cups, omitting the crust and the hard candies, and just refrigerating.

Fabulous, light, sweet lemon taste, flavorful. In lieu of one pie, I put the mix in 24 individual serving pie shells (already made by Keebler). So I didn't have the Nilla wafer crust in the recipe but the mouse complemented the graham cracker crust pie shells beautifully. Served them at Easter and one guest consumed 8 of them! Highly recommend!0

I use this recipe very often over the weekends. I don't always use the crust recomended in this recipe but a ready made graham cracker crust and it is just as yummy. I also do not always decorate the top with the whip and corn syrup it isn't that nessecary.
