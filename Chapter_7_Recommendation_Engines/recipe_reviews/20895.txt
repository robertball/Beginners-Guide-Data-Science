We were having pasta one night, and I was trying to figure out something to go with it, saw that we had all the ingredients for this sauce and whipped it up in no time.  It's now a family favorite and we make it all the time! It's really easy and sooooo good with pasta, chicken, fish, nearly anything!

This is a great cream sauce recipe - either plain or to start from.  I doubled the recipe and served it on ham/asparagus pasta.  I did add a lot of fresh ground pepper.  I think next time I prepare this - I will add either shallots, mushrooms, and/or fresh parsley that has been sauteed in butter - after the sauce is thickened - and then serve it on angel hair pasta or "bird nest" pasta.

Perhaps the reviewer before me didn't like it because they didn't use their favorite wine?  I used a medium sweet white wine this time - but will use a drier one next time.

Quick and dirty sauce; minimal ingredients needed.  I added basil, oregano and fresh garlic slivers to add more taste.

I also topped the pasta w/ sauteed basil & lemon chicken breast.

You have got to be kidding me...There is way too much salt in this sauce. I should have used my better judgement and only used half, but I dumped it all in AS PER RECIPE. Sorry to say, but that was a huge mistake. It tasted like ocean water! I will try the reduced version next time, but am rating this based on the original recipe..GADZOOKS!

This sauce was so easy, throw it all together and voila! No mixing steps. I was concerned it would come out lumpy, ended up smooth as a baby's butt. I gave this a 4 because of the lack of flavour. I added garlic and chives to mine. Great base sauce.
I served if over bow tie pasta, shrimp and Brocoli. Yumm

Very good!  It was tasty, yet practical.  I served this over chicken and my fiance loved it.  I only added half the salt,and it was still great.  I also left out a pinch of the flour, only because I like a thinner cream sauce.  This is a keeper!!!

For what it is, it is just great!  A quick, dead simple white wine sauce that tastes lovely.  I thought it worked well over some zucchini and green peppers and pasta, but I'm sure it'll have a lot of uses.

Thanks alot!

Pretty good white sauce.  It will just cover a lb of noodles with veggies. I will try it again with some other pasta dishes found on this site that have some spices in it...cuz this sauce will help zing it up.

I don't like giving negative feedback, especially when everyone's techniques vary and create different flavors, so it could have just been me, but I did not care for this at all. I've made other white wine sauces before because my husband loves it, but just as others have stated, it was very bland and way too salty and the wine flavor was so strong is absolutely drowned the chicken and pasta I poured it over. We ended up ordering takeout.  I added a few herbs (basil, tarragon, fresh garlic) but nothing would bring out the flavor and dull down the excessive wine taste. I'm sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Man, just wasted 2 cups of cream and 1 1/2 cup wine when the whole thing CURDLED.  I read the first 20 reviews and no one mentioned anything about being careful of curdling.  No idea what happened, but am SOOOO disappointed.  I need to read up on the science of how NOT to curdle you cream when adding wine.

I'e been using this recipe since I came across it in 2006.  However, since my culinary skills have improved so has the quality of this sauce courtesy of the modifications I have chosen.  I add only 3/4 tsp salt.  Additionally, i substitute half the amount of flour called for with 1 tbs of cornstarch instead which eliminates the "flour-ey" taste and thickens the sauce all in one go.  As my Grandmother taught me, "Recipes are only a guideline â€“ you can do anything you want."  SO . . . many thanks for the past years of this lovely white wine sauce : )

This is a very basic white wine sauce that has potential to be amazing! When I made this, I added some 1/4 tsp garlic salt (in place of normal salt), 1 TBS garlic powder, and freshly chopped garlic as well. I also added a little flour to thicken. I let the heavy cream, wine and previous ingredients heat up. Then I added some sun dried tomatoes and peas. At the same time, I diced some chicken, seasoned it with salt and garlic powder and browned it in a different pan, then added a splash of white wine for added flavor. Once the chicken was almost cooked I added it to the sauce to finish cooking. I also added some spiral noodles and tossed it together. It came out delicious! This is a basic recipe but with some of your own touches it can be great!

Pretty good, but a little too heavy on the wine for my tastes. I adjusted the amount of wine to 2/3 cup, and it was still a little over powering. Still tasted good, just next time I will reduce to 1/2 cup wine. Served over sauteed chicken breast, mushrooms and linguine, everyone liked it!

Very easy and adaptable!  I used half & half instead of heavy cream because it was what I had on hand.  I also added some sauted mushrooms and chopped roasted red peppers.   My husband really liked it on some ravoli with a little bit of crushed red pepper.

I would not recommend following this recipe exactly. Usually I add salt to taste, but this one time I followed the recipe and I regret it. With the wine and the salt it tasted like ocean water. I used a cooking wine, so the extra salt was probably not necessary, but I didn't realize it until it was too late. I also could have used a lot less wine. I had to add a ton of milk to the sauce to make it edible. Next time, IF I make this again, I'm going strictly by taste. Be careful if you try this recipe.

good base sauce. I cut the wine in half, used half and half instead of cream. I added garlic, italian seasoning, lemon, salt and pepper, and parmesan cheese.

Good basic recipse, but I have to agree with those that commented on too much salt. Being warned beforehand, I cut the salt down by half and it was still too much for our taste (and we generally don't mind things a little salty). I added some half and half and a dash of sugar to counteract it. The sugar hint is one I learned from my mother - it "calms down" saltiness if you overdo it. Just a a little bit at a time though (by taste) so the sauce doesn't become noticeably sweet. After these corrections it was very good over my seared scallops and linguine pasta! Oh, I also added a clove of garlic, minced - sauteed in the pan in olive oil before adding the other ingredients.

If you reduce the wine a little you can add some jarred artichoke hearts.  Just cut them up a little and add to chicken.  I also use chicken thighs, season them and saute them in butter and olive oil and reserve the flavor for the sauce.

When I first tried making this, I followed the recipe as is, and thought it was good, but not great. When I made it enough and finally got comfortable with it, I started to add some other ingredients to it. I first caramelized some garlic in a couple tablespoons of butter and a drizzle of olive oil. Then I added the wine and the heavy cream and let the wine reduce. I also added a little bit of chicken stock, and some dried herbs, and thought that it came out wonderfully with the additions. Very simple yet delectable sauce. Will be making this again. I love wine sauce.

Delicious! Added 1 teaspoon of oregano and basil for a little bit more flavor. Once on the pasta, I sprinkled some grated parm on top as well as fresh parsley and cilantro with a freshly squeezed lemon. :)

This recipe was excellent, simple, and quick.  I followed it exact, except for the fact that I doubled it.  I made bowtie pasta, sauted some minced garlic, chopped onions and red bell pepper, mushrooms, peas, and threw in some leftover rotisserie chichen.  After the pasta was drained I threw everything in the large pot and mixed it.  (This was not salty, let alone too salty.  Perhaps the other reviewer accidentally used a tablespoon of salt instead of a teaspoon).

I made this exactly how it was supposed to be made. Maybe it was the cheap wine I used, I will try this again and use a better wine. The wine was just SO overwhelming in the sauce.

Okay, so this sauce has just changed my life. How can a sauce do that, you ask?  By taking a dish I've made for YEARS and turning it into the most scrumptious meal my family has had in a long while.  Garlic mushrooms are a dinner staple, ie, fresh garlic, butter, sea salt, fresh pepper, and fresh mushrooms cooked in the oven for about 40 mins.... tonight I COMBINED the cooked mushrooms with the white wine sauce (plus fresh parsley but no salt).  It was sooo amazing... poured over some simple sauteed chicken breasts... sigh.  DELISH.   This simple sauce recipe is just sitting here, waiting for each chef to come along and make it their own.   I will be adding sauteed onions and serving over fish, or broccoli and over pasta... or with chocolate over cake... okay maybe not the last one, but you get the idea...  it's a great recipe to add to your arsenal of yummy tricks.   Yep.  Life changed.

I made this exactly as stated and it was way too salty and I really like salt. I think with some changes it would be a good sauce but as is I do not like it.

This turned out great! It was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe. I had no parsley to add in the recipe, but I added juice from two whole lemons. After the sauce was ready, I added to fresh broccoli and lightly fried chicken and baked for 35 min on 350 deg. I will definitely be using this sauce recipe again to put in with chicken and broccoli!

Not only was it bland, but the wine flavor was too much.  Will NEVER make again.

I found this very sauce easy and good.  I used dill instead of parsley and less salt because I served it over fish and shrimp.  I added the sauce to the fish (sauteed in butter with fresh dill and red peppers) when it was almost done.  It came out beautiful, thank you!

This was really good, and so easy! I added too much wine though, so it was a bit overpowering...but that was totally my own fault. I also added garlic powder and some chopped artichoke hearts to go with the ravioli I made. I would make this again for sure, but not be as heavy handed on the wine!

This is how I made it, and I liked it:

- half an onion
- tsp minced garlic
- 1 cup half and half creamo (less fat)
- 3/4 cup wine
- 1 Tbsp flour
- tsp paprika
- seasoning salt until your desired saltiness
- cut up fresh basil

Fry onion & garlic in a pan until the onion is soft. Add the rest of the ingredients. Was very good.

Very good base sauce.  I would definitely add some extra spices of your liking though, as it is a little plain for my tastes by itself!  Very rich and creamy though!

This is a good easy sauce. My wife cannot have gluten, so for a gluten free option substitut the flour with corn starch, but make sure to use half of what it calls for in flour as corn starch thickens WAY more than flour does.

I just made this for the first time and LOVE IT! The only thing I did different was I added a splash of lemon juice (and I mean a splash!) and a dash of basil. I eyeballed the salt to be on the safe side because I do use cooking wine that has a salty taste already. I will definately be using this recipe over and over again!

SUPER SAUCE! I used this over Stuffed Chicken! 

Start with 1/2 the salt, then salt to taste!

Other than that, it was amazing. Wonderful base sauce, as everyone will add more of the things they like. There really is no way to mess this up! I added fresh parsley and garlic; I will be adding more fresh herbs next time!

And too winey? Not at all! I used white cooking wine, and it came out wonderful. Everyone loved it!

I am sorry to be honest here, but this sauce tastes too bitter with the white wine.  I suggest adding in some butter, roasted garlic and a ton of seasonings to this recipe.

I am rating on this recipe as it is written. The ingredients are a little off and throwing them all in a saucepan before cooking the flour can't be right.  I thought I would try it though.... and it just wasn't very good.

This is a great base sauce!! I didn't use all the salt it called for because I added Parmesan cheese to the sauce. I also added oregano, about a tsp. of chopped garlic, and a can of mushrooms. I put the sauce over cheese tortellini and it was fantastic!!! Whole family loved it and I would consider making it for a dinner party! Thanks a bunch!

Thanks for the recipe. It's absolutely simple and a great base for this type of sauce. I did add a few pats of butter and sauted some mince garlic with it to start, and used a little over half a cup of chardonay. I added a bunch of italian seasonings and a little of some shredded italian cheese. We had chicken breasts stuffed with fontina cheese and prosciutto and poured this sauce over it. With asparagus risotto as the side. It was a great meal.

Waaaay too much salt!  Next time I will use half.  I ended up adding sugar to this to counter the salt a little and then it tasted ok.  Will not make this the same way again next time.  Other than the salt issue, this recipe is quick and decent but needs some punch to it.

Very easy.  I added fresh parsley, ground pepper and shredded parmesan cheese.  I used this sauce over broccoli, cauliflower and pasta.

Great recipe base, used half the salt, a hint of minced garlic, and some Italian seasoning instead of parsley. I'm serving it drizzled over green beans, but it would be great on pasta or maybe fish! Found a really yummy Chardonay out of the deal. I bought it for the recipe because it was on sale, and had a glass while I was cooking. Now I need to buy a few more bottles!

I made a half recipe of this to serve over chicken and proscuitto with mashed potatoes.  I cut the salt in half as previous reviewers suggested, and added a little minced garlic.  I also fixed the sauce in the pan that I had sauteed the chicken in, so there was a bit of olive oil and other spices.  It was delicious, we'll definitely make it this way again.  Thanks!

It's a good recipe except there is way to much salt in it. I thought a tsp sounded like too much but I did it anyway. Next time I will only use a half a tsp.

I would make this again, but next time I will sift the flour better.  Mine came out in little clumps when I added that to the liquid ingredients.  I also added italian seasoning and a little garlic to spice it up a bit.

I used this sauce with some chopped turkey over pasta.  Delicious!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning to give it some zip.  Yummy!  Kids and hubby loved it!

Tastes exactly like the center of an undercooked loaf of bread.

I'm not sure if I make it wrong or if it's just not my taste.

One note and winey as written. Reduce wine to 1/3 to 1/2. Add TBL butter. Use a heavy hand with seasonings (double or triple the herbs) and add garlic powder and (white) pepper.

Simple, delicious sauce.  Made it for the first time.  The sauce did break, but I found a fix..  whisk an egg yolk with a little of the wine... then very slowly, while whisking, add your broken sauce.  It completely fixed it.. it was smooth, and tasted great!  Yes, when I was done eating I realized I just ate a whole stick of butter, but who cares if I get fat.  My mother will still love me.

Used this recipe as a base but changed a few things.  Reduced the wine by 1/2, used chicken broth but dissolved flour in a little water before adding to avoid lumping.

Great wine sauce, i sauteed garlic in butter & then added the remaining ingredients. also added black pepper & half of freshly squeezed lemon to sauce while cooking.   Cooked chicken  in a cast iron pan with olive oil & butter until lightly browned, keep chicken warm in a 200 degrees oven. Put the sauce on the side so that everyone could put the sauce they wanted on the delicious dish it is a keeper. Served with Broccoli & Mashed Potato. Goes well with 14 hands cabernet wine.

I tweaked it a bit. Used light half and half (all we had left), a Chardonnay wine, added Italian seasoning,  garlic and black pepper. It was great over baked Italian chicken and rice. Took less than 10 mins and sauce was restaurant quality! I will certainly try this again with seafood and pasta!

I made a compromise, I would have given it a 3 but hubby LOVED it  and would have given it 5 stars. I thought the wine taste was overpowering, but he didn't. I did add some garlic. It seemed to need a little something. Might play around with this. I used a chardonnay. Hmmmm....

This is a good basic white wine recipe. However, I was still able to taste a lot of alcohol. So next time I think I would reduce the amount to put in.

A reasonable, creamy sauce that lacked flavour. I didn't find there was too much salt. I actually had to add more as it was quite bland. I also added pepper and extra parsley. I had it with chicken and I cooked the chicken in season all and lemon juice. Mixed with the sauce, it gave it the the kick it really needed.

Loved this sauce. I added 4 garlic cloves minced, and about 1/2 cup chicken broth. I added flour to get my desired consistency. I also added mushrooms to chicken medallions coated with Italian bread crumbs, and  stirred everything together with pasta.

This sauce is just gluggy and not pleasant.  Perhaps if HALF the amount of flour went in, it would have been fine.

I have never made a white wine sauce before and I decided to try this recipe. Everyone in my family really liked it. It turned out very well. I had read the other reviews and decided to cut the salt in half I also decided to reduce the wine before making the sauce and I added garlic.

WAY too much wine in this recipe and I even doubled the recipe but not the wine.  Thank goodness for other ingredients I had on hand like cream cheese, whole milk, and butter to salvage this meal.

Okay so this is a good starter sauce but WAY too salty! Next time I'll just put a tiny bit of salt.. Almost not edible because of how salty it is! Other than that I liked it a lot.. We added garlic, onions, and black pepper and put on top of shrimp pasta. A learning experience but will use it again my way!

This sounded so good... we made it to go over sauteed shrimp, scallops, tilapia with lunguini. We went straight by the recipe and it was just terrible. Tried covering it up with spices and such... but definitely wouldn't reccomend.

I should have known better. 1 cup cream to 3/4 of wine.  Whoa, way to winey. I added another 1/2 cup cream and then some milk and it was still very overpowering.  I cooked for a long time trying to cook down the wine. Plus way too much salt for the amount. I used half of what was called for.  I think they need to take a relook at this recipe, yet there are a lot of people who like it.

I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe. My boyfriend requests this sauce all the time. I use vermouth for a stronger wine flavor, I also use half the salt because the first time it was too salty for me. Pepper is a nice touch as well. Really easy to make gluten free by replacing the regular flour with all purpose gfree flour :)

I didn't have cream, so I substituted milk and added 2 Tbsp of butter to thicken with the flour. It was a touch saltier than I'm used to, but still good. I only gave it four stars because I preferred it after I added some garlic, oregano, and basil, but it is very good as a base, at least, for a creamy wine sauce.

After following the directions to the letter, I made this a second time around. What I did differently this time was cook out the alcohol in the wine a little bit, then I added the flour, herbs and cream. It tasted much better than the first time I made it. I also added some Parmesan cheese and about a clove of chopped garlic. It tasted much better but next time I make this, I will probably use fresh herbs and leave the cheese out (unless I feel it could use it).

This was a good starter sauce.  I used a Piesporter wine, which was entirely too sweet.  You definitely need a drier wine for this sauce.  Otherwise, I think it would have been really tasty!  I'll try it again with a drier wine.

I really liked this. It was simple to throw together and its just a basic sauce, so it was real easy to put in the flavors that I wanted..I added fresh garlic and fresh chopped basil and tossed this with farfalle and roasted veggies - it was amazing!!  

I don't know what people were talking about with the "too much salt" comments. I just eyeballed the salt, and ended up having to go back and add more, so I probably put in more than what was called for. I don't usually use a lot of salt in my cooking - when I think something needs salt, it REALLY needs salt, lol.. But to each their own.  I will definitely be making this again =)

I bounced between a 3 and a 4 star. I am somewhat inexperienced cooking with wines and found the taste overwhelming.  Perhaps because I used a white cooking wine rather than drinking wine? (Salt is added to cooking wine and changes the flavor.) Next time I will use the Chardonnay I drink and add only a tablespoon or two at a time until I achieve the taste that I desire.
I ended up adding quite a bit more cream (used a mixture of heavy and half and half) to balance the flavor, and even added a bit of pan drippings to mellow the wine taste.
Rich and creamy thick.

It's a simple tasting sauce BUT too much wine!  I served it to my children and had to cut it with cold milk after taking it off the stove and adding it to my macaroni.  All in all, good quick white sauce for a change up.

FABULOUS and easy!   Instead of dried parsley I used a couple teaspoons of Jerk Seasoning and mixed in with chicken breasts (baked with jerk seasoning) and whole grain egg noodles.  We WILL be having this again!!

I liked the sauce, I thought it was a little bland, I added less salt then it called for and lemon pepper. WONDERFUL! I will be making it again... this was great on fish but would also be good on veggies!

excellent! I used this on sauteed scallops and veggies on penne. It was really fast and easy and turned out great. I used sage instead of parsley since that's what i had on hand.

This turned out pretty good!  I took a previous reviewers advice and added some Garlic, Oregano and Basil and added slightly less salt.    I had some left over grilled Salmon in the fridge so I flaked it up and added it to the sauce with some sauteed onions.  Stirred in some cooked Lingune and added some grated parmesan at the end.

Absolutely excellent! My husband raved about this one. The kids wern't into the sauce but I cooked the chicken seperately so they ate that. I subbed oregano and basil for the parsley, added about a dozen roasted garlic cloves (roughly chopped), and some frozen peas. And the whole thing was SUPER quick. This will be a staple for sure!

This recipe is one of the best I've found, to make the base for chicken or turkey tetrazzini.  My alteration includes starting with sauteeing mushrooms and minced garlic in olive oil, then making the sauce from there.  It definitely needs garlic maybe instead of the salt.  I use Marsala cooking wine, which makes a great tasting sauce.

it's a good base but it's way to bland. I seasoned it with a heap of garlic, dried roasted red pepper,white pepper, and basil. I used a gluten free flour and half and half. I used a very cheap pinot grigio and decided that it was too strong in the sauce so then, I added almost alnother half  or half and half and about three tablespoons of chicken broth. served over GF raviolli and chicken. My VERY PICKY husband is devouring it as I type this.

Wine can be overpowering and salt should be halved. I've also added some chicken stock as the sauce was a but bland without it.  It's an okay sauce but I'd probably use another recipe next time.

This is a great base recipe! I added some chicken granules to take the edge off of the wine flavor. I added about 1/2 teaspoon. Also added about a 1/2 cup of fresh parm and Ramano. Added garlic to my taste and it turned out delicious. I poured it over baked chicken stuffed with spinach and cottage cheese.

Very easy to make and very rich. At first it didn't seem like much sauce, but we put it on angel hair and a little went a long way. Next time I might not add as much wine--it was a pretty strong taste. Overall very good!

A good, basic white wine sauce.  It at least starts you off on a good note and then add whatever spices suit your tastes.

My Husband loved this, even though he is not a big sauce man. We don't have heavy cream in the house, so I used whole milk instead, and it was nice. Not too heavy. I added it to penne, chicken and brocoli. It was a nice simple meal,and the wine adds a nice flavor. Will be making this again!

Thank you Sal. Love the simplicity of the recipe. I added garlic and watered down the cream with a mix of water and milk (to assuage my guilt over the fat content) and added precooked cubed veggies and chicken. Yum!!

I made this sauce to go with A Farewell To Basil Fettucine also from this site. I used a very dry white wine and only a pinch of salt. The sauce was a little thicker than I wanted so rather than add any more wine I used 2 or 3T of vegetable stock which I always have on hand. This went very well with the pasta. Thanks Octogurl83.

This is a good base sauce, but I found it to be very salty, however when I paired with lightly seasoned chicken the salt was not as strong.  I will try this again with less salt.

Pretty good, but next time I would double the recipe.  I added grated parmasan cheese to mkae it a thinker consistency.  And I would do 2 parts cream to 1 part wine, the wine was a bit over powering (I used savignon blanc).  Otherwise pretty good and I'd make it again.

I was a little weary of the flour in this recipe, but decided to give it a shot.  The sauce was ok, but I found the consistency to be a little gummy - which I blame on the flour.  I will try this again, but with a little less wine and a couple dabs of butter so the sauce is creamy, but not gooey.  Good place to start.

From reading the past reviews I planed to edit this after I first tried it. I did not need to do so. Using a white wine that you really enjoy the taste off works very well. The taste was wonderful.

The consistency of this sauce was very nice and after adding more spices to this sauce it was better, but for personal taste I did not like it. I think I just did not like the wine flavor, I honestly think it would be just fine without the wine and more spices. But I gave it 4 stars because my husband really did like it, the way it is written.

GREAT sauce! It has the consistency and creaminess of alfredo sauce with the slight bite of white wine.  I made it with salmon and linguine and it was a hit. I added some sauteed garlic and basil and a little bit of lemon juice to the sauce to compliment the wine. I also cut the measurement down to six servings and it was enough for 1/2 lb salmon and 1 lb linguine. Sauce was also great with bread.

Great sauce, amazing base! I am working on replacing dairy in all recipes as my son and I are both intolerant. So instead of the heavy cream, I replaced it a with a mixture of plain soy milk with olive oil, works well. I dont know the exact ratio off the top fo my head, but this sauce is perfect and will be making many more times over.

This is a pretty good recipe. I did what other reviewers suggested and cut the salt in half, added some italian seasoning and a clove of garlic.  The only problem that I had (which was completely my fault) was I accidentally used SWEET cream....BIG MISTAKE.  Other than that, I served it over angel hair pasta, zucchini, squash and topped with broiled chicken...Delicious!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I might try it again but with a better wine.  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I used half and half and less salt.  I also added basil and oregano.  There was not enough sauce for the box of pasta, but it did taste great with turkey and broccoli!

This tasted pretty good, all be it too salty. Next time I'll have to cut the salt in half.
