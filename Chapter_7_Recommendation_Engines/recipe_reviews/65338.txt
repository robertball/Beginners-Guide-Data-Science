This was pretty good.  I used sugar free preseves (with splenda) which was a mistake.  Made it a little bitter.  Also I think 2 tablespoons lemon juice was too much.  I didn't use the lemon peel.  For dressing I used chives.  I think curry powder might be a better choice to jazz it up a bit.

This was good; I served the turkey sliced and separate because of a vegetarian, so I added walnuts to it.  The dressing could have used more intense flavor.

excellent salad, not sure on the dressing - used curry powder.
