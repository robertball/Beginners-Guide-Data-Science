This is a wonderful and very easy soup.  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and we loved it.  I couldn't find the condensed oyster stew so I just used the other two soups and also put in a small bag of crab meat chunks.

yes, this is a quick meal made with can soups. and yes, some folks will say this is not a recipe...who cares! i loved a quick easy tasty meal for a busy friday night...wife doesn't eat meat on fridays. i added a baked potato and maybe 2 ts butter. it certainly wasn't home-made, but it filled the hole in our bellies! i just added ground black pepper...very good stuff with a salad.

This is one of my little boy's favorite dishes! The recipe is really good as is, but I've still made a few changes to suit my family and to accommodate availability of ingredients. 
Condensed oyster stew is pert near impossible to find in my area, so I add an extra can of cream of potato and a medium can of oysters, undrained, instead. I also add a can of corn, drained (frozen works, too) and 3-4 medium sized fish fillets; salmon works beautifully  for this, but I've gotten good results with cod and swai, too. Lastly, I add a couple tbsp of butter for a little extra richness.

I love seafood, so I love this dish. Oyster stew is hard to find in my area, so i had to make it from scratch and THEN make the seafood soup. Also added extra fresh oysters. Great dish.

Tried it last night.  This recipe was so easy. I only had frozen, small shrimp, and that worked well. My picky eater came back for seconds. I will use this one again.
