I made spelt noodles for this and just used the carrot apple and cabbage in the amounts that I had. Great comfort food!

My family liked this recipe. I always fix recipes the first time exactly as the author specifies. The second time I adjusted it for my family preferences and found it to be very forgiving. For us no noodles using 2x the apple slices and using a milder Chinese Cabbage. Great recipe in our never ending search for vegetable side dishes.

I made this several days ago based on the two reviews available. While it is very good and it's nice comfort food I felt it needed "something" -- whether some spice fewer noodles something. I am still unsure. However I had a lot of it so shared it with others who liked it better than I did. My best use of it was for breakfast though; I beat up a couple of eggs mixed in some of the recipe food put it in the frying pan and sprinkled cheese on top. Fabulous this way!! Plus I think it covers all the food groups LOL.

Tried this on a whim because I had all of the ingredient and it's delicious! I added a dash of cayenne pepper and a minced clove of garlic. It complimented the sweetness of the apples really well.

Tried this last night. I used veggie bow time noodles because this is what I had on hand. It added some additional color to the dish and was bite size. I added some sliced smoked sausage which I heated in the microwave and poured off the grease before adding to the cabbage and noodles. It made a nice one dish meal. I am eating the reheated left overs right now and it tastes good. I used half a head of cabbage left over from another meal 2 tablespoons of butter and 6 oz. of noodles.

I loved this recipe although I made a few changes to it for what I was seeking. I cooked turkey kielbasa cut into slices first and once the meat was a little brown removed it and added the butter to the pan with the small amount of drippings for added flavor. I then saut√©ed the apple with some thinly sliced and chopped Vidalia onion before adding coleslaw mix for the cabbage and carrots. I returned the kielbasa to the cabbage mix added salt and pepper to taste and once this cooked in the butter for the 12 minutes or so I added it to the egg noodles. It was delicious!!

Takes forever to shred the cabbage with a grater. Cutting it into small pieces is sufficient. he carrot added color but you do not even taste the apple. Not sure what that does to the meal. There are other comparable recipes out there.
