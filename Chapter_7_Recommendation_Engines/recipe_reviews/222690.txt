Gosh, you know......I followed this recipe closely making no changes or substitutions. The batter looked exactly as it should and it baked exactly as it should without issues. The one issue I'm having is that it turned out a little flavorless and the texture was off-putting. I feel terrible saying it, honestly. I shared one muffin with my two kids and after the first bite, noone really wanted any more. I think for me if I were to make this again, this would need more cinnamon (or maybe some additional spices), a little more vanilla and.......gosh, maybe something else. I can't put my finger on what it's missing. Three and a half stars for me.

These healthy and tasty muffins easily earn a 5 star rating from my crew.  I grated the apple and used wheat bran in place of oat bran.  I've come to expect that muffin recipes without oil are gummier than those that call for oil so the slightly chewy texture of these muffins is not off-putting for me.

These are AMAZING !!! We doubled the cinnamon and vanilla and used a gala apple. We also substituted the oat bran with old fashioned oats ground to a powder in our Vitamix. Cook time for us was 33 minutes. They are perfect and TASTY ! The inside is moist and the exterior is slightly crunchy

Delicious, however I would not recommend using cups because there is no oil in these and they stuck to the paper. Use baking spray directly into the cupcake tray!  Enjoy!

I am very happy to have found this healthy and versatile muffin recipe.  I was out of yogurt, so used a mashed banana and a 1/4 cup of oil to replace it which worked well.  I also think you could get away with a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup if you are watching your sugar intake.  I  will definitely be experimenting with adding dried fruits or nuts as I have to agree with other reviewers who found it lacking a little something.

Pretty tasty, but I did make a couple small changes....My son has a milk protein allergy, so I used vanilla flavour coconut milk yogurt. I also added a smidge more vanilla and cinnamon than called for. And I realized after I started that I was out of oat bran so I just used quick cooking oats. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Baked them in mini muffin tins (non stick metal trays, gas oven) for 10 minutes, rotated the trays, then cooked about 5 minutes more. Perfectly moist and delicious!
Normally I don't give 5 star ratings if I make changes, but I don't think anything I did was a major change from the recipe as written. 5 stars it is!

These just aren't good. I doctored up the recipe based on the review by "Sarah Jo", with extra cinnamon, spices and vanilla. Even with the additions, these are just BLAND.  I put in a few muffins, let them cool and then tried them.  I then add sugar and cinnamon to the remaining batter and cooked them.  STILL BLAND.  I even topped some with a crumble (butter, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon).  Didn't help much either.  

I also had to bake them for 50-60 minutes, and they stuck badly to the muffin paper.

Great taste and so healthy.  Super moist.  Make sure you bake it enough so it won't be too sticky.

I added about 1/4 C. oil and used sour cream instead of yogurt, because I didn't have yogurt on hand, and added about 1 t. vanilla.

Based on the reviews I added the extra oil, and vanilla. I even added a little extra sugar. 

After baking them, I took a bite and realized it needs some salt. I wish I had added 1/2 teaspoon of salt as they are just a bit lacking on the flavor.

Hopefully that will help a bit with the texture too.

This was really good.  I put a full teaspoon of vanilla and added 1/3 cup canola oil (was afraid not to)and baked them in cupcake cups.  They are so good the family will never know that they are healthy!

These muffins baked faster in my oven than stated in the recipe and ended up a little dry.   However, my 3 year old says they are yummy so we will definitely try again!  Very happy that he likes a muffin with so many veggies hidden inside.

I was pleasantly surprised with these little muffins. In my motherhood-induced sleep-deprived fog, I didn't realize until after I had popped them into the oven that they don't have any oil in them. Normally I would have corrected that, since as a child of the 80's & 90's low-fat craze I have a strong aversion to anything of that genre. But, while they are a little gummy, they are actually quite tasty.

I DID make changes though, and without those I imagine my rating would have dropped to a 3 star. They were: quick oats in lieu of oat bran (normally I would have blended them up but the baby was sleeping and I couldn't take that risk), salt (not sure how much, I just kinda shake and decide when I think it's good), 5% milk fat greek yogurt because, well, it's just yummier, and 1 tsp of cinnamon because 1/2 tsp disappears in a 1 dozen recipe. I made mini-muffins and it made 35. My 16 month old ate 5 of them today, my 3.5 year old ate zero. You win some, you lose some. But I'll be saving this recipe and trying it again, but probably with some oil in it next time!

I love that there's no oil in these muffins (just 2 eggs) and whole wheat and oats.  I didn't have oat bran so just pulsed oats up in the blender.  They turned out really moist with all the zucchini, apples and yogurt which I liked but possibly not everyone would.  They were  a little bland, they could probably use more cinnamon...or maybe some pumpkin pie spice.  Taking tips from others I did not use paper cups - use parchment muffin cups or silicon cupcake cups sprayed with nonstick spray.

These are terrific. I made just as specified, except with plums instead of apples (since that's what I had on hand), and I added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. They were moist and delicious. Add a bonus point for healthy, and another bonus point for helping use up the garden zucchini!

I followed all the directions closely and these muffins just didn't want to bake.  I don't know what went wrong or if it's the recipe but an hour in the oven and they were still raw in the middle and barely rose.  I nibbled the cooked outsides and the flavor was great, they just didn't bake at all.  I wish they would have turned out :(

This recipe did not turn out well. I substituted gluten free baking flour for the flour.
