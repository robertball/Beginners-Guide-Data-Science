I made this with Honey Grahams (Honey Maid) and added a little less sugar. It was honestly the best pie crust I have ever tasted. Delicous, truly the perfect compliment to the Key Lime pie I made. My box of crackers came in 3 individually wrapped sections and one of those sections came out as pretty much 1 1/2 cups. Thanks for the truly yummy recipe!

Wonderfully simple!

I used one package graham crackers and put them in a one gallon resealable plastic bag. A rolling pin [or large can of baked beans ;) ] gives quick cracker crumbs and the kids are eager to help. Then I added the sugar and butter to the bag, sealed it for a quick mix and pressed it into the pie shell. Done and only one dish to clean from melting the butter! :)

I doubled for a 9 x 13" recipe and omitted the cinnamon....

Great / simple / easy

The best recipes are all of these...and this one was.  Enjoy

I live in New Zealand where they don't have graham crackers, so I substituted whole wheat digestive biscuits. It turned out better than any store-bought crust I've ever had!

I used this crust in Pumpkin Pie this Thanksgiving. Now I really know what a "rave review" is! My Grandmother called her sister to give her this recipe, the pie vanished, and I got called (several times) to remind me to make it again for Christmas - wow.  Also, I accidentally double baked the crust on accident (baked it and then realized the other recipe called for an unbaked pie shell)- not to worry! Cover the exposed edges and bake away, it actually carmelizes even more...mmmmm!

Simple. Yummy. However I overbaked it once and it was hard as a rock -- so be careful!

Delicious pie crust.  Much better than store bought.  I used McVitie's Digestive Biscuits (British) and the crust turned out great.  The other changes I made were to increase the crumbled cookies/biscuits to 2 cups and increased the butter to 8 tablespoons.  It turned out great!

Easy to make and it tastes great.  I used my food processor to break up one package of graham crackers from a box.  I used this crust for the "Easy Key Lime Pie I" and "Mini Cheesecakes I"  Just wonderful.

Replicating a useful comment I followed: 1 plastic package of crackers = 1.5 cups. Put them in a plastic freezer bag and smash with rolling pin. Add butter and smoosh around in bag to mix. Use the bag to pat the crumbs down into the pan. No mess.

I must be in the minority. This was a little too wet and gooey for me, so I added one more cup of crushed cinnamon grahams. After I tried it, I couldn't get past the crunch-crunch of the sugar. It ruined the flavor of my pie. This crust recipe isn't for me.

Perfect.  I can't imagine purchasing another pre-made graham cracker crust.  This recipe is simple and delicious.  Ideal for lemon ice box or key lime pie.  I've even used it as a topping for yogurt.

This really should be illegal its so good. I made one exactly per directions and baked it 7 minutes, then the next day I realized that since I was making a pumpkin cheesecake and shouldn't have baked it 7 minutes but just refrigerated it for an hour (since I would be baking the cheesecake for 40 minutes) I broke it apart in the springform and tasted it to make another in the empty pan. Well that the was the beginning of the end, since I stood there over the pan and then proceeded to eat 1/2 of it every single mouthful saying, "omg, yummm"... so ya. This is perfect! PS. You will be happy to know I kept the mistake (the other 1/2 of the crust) in a ziplock for later cookie eating, so nothing went to waste :)

It was frustrating pressing the mixture into the pie plate because it was so crumbly. Even when it was baked as directed and chilled for hours, it was still crumbly and fell apart when I cut into it. It's actually quite tasty but personally, not worth the disappointment.
-I made this recipe again. I added a few extra tablespoons of butter to hold it together well. I overcooked it by a couple minutes but it was quite tasty and didn't fall apart. Next time I'll do the same but I won't overcook it. (= Thank you for the yummy recipe!

Brown sugar instead of white, (or half brown and half white), tastes wonderful.  :)

This crust is indeed a keeper but honestly I think the amount of pie crust is pithy. I prefer a crust that is a bit crustier. Therefore I use an entire box of crackers. You could probably use most of the box except two crackers because I had a bit leftover. I use an entire stick of butter and 1/3 c. of sugar. It makes a delicious, crustier crust. The crust appears to withstand some ingredients such as a pudding pie a bit better. I recognize that many home chefs / cooks will say that this is TOO MUCH crust but it's a matter of taste. I think these crusts are too thin and don't give the contents enough support.

I used this for a no bake lemon cream cheese pie from this site. I cut down the sugar to 2 tablespoons and it was just sweet enough. I will never use a storebought graham cracker crust again. Thanks for the great recipe!

If made with Whole Foods organic cinnamon graham crackers, there is no need for the sugar or cinnamon.  This makes it a 2 ingredient recipe!
Also, try organic butter, it is so much better than conventional.

Great recipe. Been making my own crusts for years. I also substitute chocolate Graham crackers, chocolate animal crackers for a nice chocolate crust fir cheesecakes etc. Also can use any cookies processed and add ground nuts for added flavor. Great way to use leftover cookies and crackers

Good, but a little too sweet. I will make it again, but will add less sugar. I used one package of graham crackers out of the three that came in the box, as another reviewer did, rather than measure the crumbs, and it worked just fine.

SO easy!  I did as one reviewer suggested and used a gallon-sized plastic bags to crush the crackers, mix in the sugar, and add the melted butter.  It's got to be simple for me to like it, and this is!  Yummy, too.

A good go-to recipe for graham cracker crust.  I reduced the amount of sugar and omitted the cinnamon.  For ease in preparing the crust, I  pressed a measuring cup around the edges to smooth and even out the crust.

It was my first time making my own graham cracker crust and it came out perfect. My husband and kids we're very impressed. Will be making my own crust from now on. I think I'll try chocolate cookies next time.

I will give this 5 stars for taste, however it came out a little too "wet."  I don't know if I did something wrong but it wasn't a total flop.  I made this with a New York Cheesecake and it complimented it nicely... Just a little too sticky for me.

I love this. I never realized how easy (or cheap!) it was to make a graham cracker crust. I'll never buy the store bought again. I like to add a full tablespoon of cinnamon to the crust for extra flavor. It could also use a little more butter, but I usually don't add it because of the amount of butter used inside the crust!

Absolutely loved it. My entire family loves it too. Its very simple to make. Its good with and without the cinnamon. My only thing: DO NOT PRE-BAKE!! My first time trying this I tried that and I became a gooey mess in my pie pan. When I tried again I chilled it for about an hour then I baked it with the cheesecake in it and it was perfect. Will continue to use this

It turned out perfect although I had to replace the Graham Crackers as they are not available in Germany. If you are from Europe: Try British Digestives or German Hobbits (Brandt). You would have to use less sugar as they are already rather sweet themselves. I used 2 Tablespoons. I'm going to stick to this recipe.

very easy to make.  This was my very first homade graham cracker crust.  It came out very nice.  I used this with the cheese cake cup recipe on this site and it was great.  I to have any easy way of breaking up the crackers....two hyper 2 year olds and some plastic bags.

I needed 9x13, so as others suggested I used 2 packages of honey maid graham's with 12 Tbl melted butter. My final dessert will be very sweet so I only added a heaping 1/3 C sugar.  Perfect!

Excellent.  I used 7 T of butter and 1/4 cup sugar. One sleeve of graham crackers fills an 8" crust. UPDATE:  Seven T of butter was too much (for me), seemed a bit greasy.  Next time I will go with six as stated!  I use salted butter, so next time will use the 1/3 cup of sugar also. AND use a quality Graham cracker.
Just a reminder to use the recipe as stated and THEN make changes!

If you try this you will NEVER buy another one of those already made crust. One graham cracker sleeve is just about 1 1/2 cups to save you some time.

The perfect graham cracker crust. I didn't change anything and didn't bake it, just used it for a cheesecake. But it was sweet, crumbly, yet stuck together like it was supposed to...it made enough for one pie for me, so if you are making two pies, double it! Oh and I forgot, I didn't use the cinnamon, but the crust is really good when you throw some nuts into your food processor and use that in replacement for half of the graham cracker crumbs. =)

I left out the sugar as Graham Crackers are full of it anyway. Wouldn't want to add more, it was not missed. I also used salted butter, which in my opinion goes well with the sweetness of the crust and the Key Lime Pie I used it for.

so easy and so good.  i used this recipe for a key lime pie (without the cinnamon) and it was perfect.  i used saran wrap to pack it in nice and evenly and get a smooth finish.  i cooked it a little longer, about 10 minutes, for a nice crisp crust.  the first time i used it i let it set overnight and it had a firmer texture, which i liked.  the second time i put my pie filling in it not long after it had cooled and although it got rave reviews i felt like the texture was more to my liking the first time.

Delicious and easy. I followed another users suggestion to put exactly one packaged section (out of the 3 sections in one graham cracker box) in a freezer bag and ground it with a can of soup. It was so easy and not time consuming. I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. This was PERFECT! and went really well with my banana cream pie.

I blended some ginger snaps and dare cinnamon cookies together instead of using graham crackers. Followed the same recipe and used it with a pumpkin pie cheesecake. MAN was it good!

Exceptional crust! As many reviews have suggested, I too used the Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers. I used my food processor to pulverize the Graham crackers, it was quick and easy. I used light brown sugar instead of the white sugar. The subtle molasses flavor in the  brown sugar added the flavor profile I was looking for in a Graham cracker crust. I didn't use the cinnamon. I chilled the crust for an hour without baking and used this as the crust for Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe. The result was excellent, by far the best Graham cracker crust my family and I have tasted. The 14.4 oz. package of Honey Maid Graham Crackers on the store shelves today contains 3 sleeves of crackers and yields almost 3 cups of crumbs, each sleeve is approximately 1 cup. Food manufacturers are continually downsizing pack and product sizes, so this info may soon be obsolete.

Used Honey Maid Cinnamon flavor graham crackers, which were the perfect flavor for a pumpkin cheesecake crust. I would add a dash of salt next time to balance the sweetness, but otherwise, it was perfect. Baking the crust kept it from getting soggy. Final results... excellent.

I baked this WONDERFUL crust at 350 degrees for 6 minutes, shut the oven off and let it in the oven for another 2 minutes. I added less than a teaspoon of melted margarine per pie. Used this crust with No Bake Peanut Butter Pie. Awesome recults.

If you grind the crumbs super fine, they absorb the butter better, so it will be less wet. Works awesomely for pumpkin pie.

Wow! I used this recipe twice now and both times it came out perfect! I used a ziploc bag and a rolling pin to crush my crackers. This is my "go to" pie crust recipe from now on. Not at all hard to put together. Thank you for sharing.

I messed up the first crust by using only 16 crackers and not measuring them after I crushed them, then proceeded to add the sugar then the butter, which turned out to be WAY to much liquid. I went ahead and baked it anyway, and  minutes later, YUK!  too buttery. Okay, back to the drawing board, FOLLOW THE RECIPE AND MEASURED and Wallah!  Beautiful!  I love this crust and always bought the premade ones, never again!  Thanks for this recipe.  (I omitted the cinnamon just for personal preferences)

I didn't have any graham crackers but used this recipe with all the assorted biscuits (even the ccocoa ones with icing)that I could find in the house:) Beat them to death in a zip lock bag with rolling pin, mixed with butter+sugar and pressed into cupcake tins. Worked out well with cheesecake filling...the verdict was that it was too "sugary" - so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. Will try out with some raisin oatmeal and Oreo cookies next!

Perfect! I'll never buy another premade graham cracker crust. This was so easy and so much better.  I did it all in a gallon zip-loc bag (except melted butter in a dish) - so little clean up.  GREAT with key lime pie.

This recipe is delicious!  Everyone preferred the crust to the rest of the pie.  Easy way to break up the crackers into crumbs is with a rolling pin.

We enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe!  ALWAYS remember that the quality of the end product equales the quality of the food you put into it!  SO if you use cheap crackers it will NOT have the full body flavor you may want.  I like this much better than buying the ones in the store!  Thanks

I tried this recipe since it had overwhelmingly positive reviews. I made the recipe as-is, using 1 pack of graham crackers since that's what others suggested (slightly less than 1.5 cups). This crust is way too gooey/liquidy (looks nothing like the crumbly crust in the photo) and tastes like pure butter. I find it to be totally disgusting and will never make it again. Perhaps I needed more graham crackers, but I am not going to try it again to find out...

ok.. what did I do wrong, TWICE? I followed the directions exactly and it turned to a gooey blob in the bottom of my pie plate.

very good. I made this by the recipe and left out the cinnamon. It held together pretty well the first day but was a bit crumbly on the second day. Went very well with the key lime pie I made.

The night before, I made an attempt at blondie brownie bites....but sadly I way overbaked them & they were HARD as rocks, not edible! But I spent so much time & effort, I couldn't toss it! So I ground it up, & mixed almost 2 cups of the "brownie crubs" with the recipe (taking place of graham cracker crubs). And boy, let me tell you, how can I ever make a "normal" crust again?! It was delish, amazing! Everyone thought It was THE BEST crust ever! SOOO good soo good, I used it as a crust for lemon bars...oh amazing.I had to give this 4 * b/c I didn't actually use graham crackers, but everything else was the same :)

Turned out great.  I replaced cinnamon with 3 tsp of fresh grated ginger and use Splenda instead of sugar.

So easy & much better tasting than the packaged store crusts!!  I also made chocolate graham cracker crusts with chocolate graham crackers in place of chocolate cookie crusts. I have also added dry oatmeal to this recipe & it makes the crust look "pretty".  Just add a touch more butter if you add the oatmeal.  I will not be buying packaged crusts again!!

really easy to make, but I found that baking it made it hard and crystalized.  I threw that batch away, and made another and put in the fridge....PERFECT.

There was too much butter for the amount of graham cracker crumbs, so I mixed in about another half cup. I did not add the cinnamon but I'm sure it would be delicious. It was fanastic under my pumpkin pie!

The taste was really good. I omitted the cinammon cause I was making a lemon ice-box pie. Next time I will add a little more butter as the baked crust did not hold together as well as I like it.

Excellent crust!  Love the touch of  cinnamon makes it smell so good as it bakes.  I doubled the recipe and only added 1/2 cup of sugar.  The tip about one package of crackers = 1 and 1/2 cups was perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a good, easy crust. I use it for cheesecakes, and it's always a hit. I've taken to using a full stick of butter, which seems to hold together a bit better.

Great recipe!  I made it exactly as written and it came out wonderfully.  I combined dry ingredients first and then added the butter.  7 minutes really is perfect... I did one for a bit longer and it ended up burning when I baked it again with the filling!  I will be using this recipe for all of my graham cracker crusts.  Thanks Carol!

This recipe is amazingly forgiving.   I just lost 15 pounds and my husband needs to lose a lot more than that, so I'm cooking as light as I can these days.  I substituted Kroger's zero calorie sweetener (Apriva, the one that can be used in baking) and Smart Balance for the sugar and butter.  I filled the baked shell with a no-sugar chocolate pudding.   And it was STILL good.

I love this crust it's good. I made it with the no bake peach pie a few days ago, it's perfect together. I didn't bake it I just put it in the fridge and chilled it for like almost 2 hrs. because I lost track of time. I think next time I will try making it with either chocolate or cinnamon graham crackers! Thanks so much for this recipe.

Perfect! Used with cheesecakes, fresh fruit pies, and key lime. Once ran out of graham crackers and subsituted animal crackers- just as delicious.

This crust is so easy and delicious that I will never buy a pre-made one again.  I made this for the Easy Key Lime Pie I which was tart, so the sweetness of this crust was perfect for it.  If I use this again for a sweeter filling, I may use less sugar.

This recipe is really good. I usually get frustrated when  preparing graham cracker crust but this was really easy to mix and press to the pan. The crust was just as good as the cheesecake!

This crust tasted very good and I liked the amount of cinnamon and sugar. When I made it as directed though there were too many Graham cracker crumbs and not enough butter. I increased the butter by 2 tbsp and was able to thoroughly incorporate the crumbs but I had way too much for the 8" pie plate. I will use this recipe again and adjust the amount of ingredients.

I found that you needed to add a little more butter to get it to stick together properly, BUT... then it tasted a little too buttery.  I was Very Impressed though... first time I made graham cracker crust and i thought it turned out great

My favorite recipe for graham cracker crust. I mainly use this for chocolate pudding pie and the addition of the cinnamon adds a nice "Mexican" zing to the flavor.  I like to make my own graham cracker crumbs as I like a coarser "home-made" texture.  This makes enough for a nice thick crust. Perfect!

It made a little too much and at the top of the pie the crust was a little too thick. I thought it would crumble when I tried to cut it, but it stayed together fairly well. A nice basic recipe.

Great recipe! Used coconut oil instead of butter which probably made it a little more rich. Used 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

Simply and delicious! It was almost the same recipe that I use for my cheesecake.  I use an extra 1/2 cup of graham crackers and no cinnamon in that recipe.  One sleeve of graham crackers will give you the 1 1/2 cups.  It made just enough to fill my 9 inch pie dish.  I used the bottom of a glass to help press it down.

This was an excellent recipe,however the temperature on ovens may vary.I put my oven on 375 as told by the recipe and it nearly burned the graham cracker to ruin so when cooking these please watch how long and the temperature that its set to.They came out very delicious and what a tasty alternative to regular pie crust,thanks again.

Great recipe and fast!  Try omitting the cinnamon, adding 2 Tbs peanuts and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and mix in a food processor or ninja... Nice variation for lemon or lime pies..

Could use less sugar and I don't think it would taste any less tasty... also this makes a really thick crust if used in a normal pie pan (which I like, but it was REALLY thick).  But it was really good & I see no reason to look any further for a go-to crust recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon due to the type of pie I was making (peanut butter) but think it would be good depending on the flavor.

Super easy and very tasty.  Used low fat honey grahams, which I crushed in a plastic bag with a rolling pin (I was surprised at how much work that actually required).  I used about 12 full crackers (with 4 sections each) to get 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.  Made a very nice shell for my Key Lime Pie.

This recipe was the best graham cracker crust ever! I used graham wafer crumbs and didnt change any of the ingredients. I added the cinnamon like the recipe suggests and you could definetly taste it and it tastes really yummy! I used it with a chocolate pudding pie and the chocolate and cinnamon went together nicely.

Yes, I bought the wrong kind of graham crackers and got Honey instead. I added less sugar and put in cinnamon with a pinch of ground cloves. My boyfriend loved it. Complemented me on the crust instead of the pie... lol

Delicious! I used about 5tbsp of butter instead of 6 and slightly more than 1/4 cup of sugar (brown or white). I baked the crust at 375F for about 8 minutes for my pumpkin pie, because I used homemade pumpkin puree for the pie filling and it had more moisture than the canned stuff. Delicious! This will be my go-to graham cracker crust from now on!

I tried this crust & my family LOVED it! It was quick & easy.  I found it to be too sweet but next time I'll just use less sugar.

This was great!  I used to make a crust for cheesecake and it was so good - instead of the crust being an afterthought, it stood on it's own!

Great crust! Use the cinnamon, it's great when it fits the filling (i.e., most fruit pies).

This is a wonderful, basic recipe. I also use the Honey graham crackers and use abou 1//4 c. sugar which is perfect. I try to vary the size of my crumbs, some chunky, some finer. It is funny, but that little change causes people to rave about it!

Crushed 1 section of a box of graham crackers.  Added 4T melted butter and 1/4 cup sugar.  Baked as directed for 5 mins.  Next time will melt 5T butter.  Perfect compliment to the cherry cheesecake recipe from this site.

Delicious and easy!  I pulverized the graham crackers into super fine crumbs in my food processor and the result was the consistency of the store-bought but much better tasting.

Way too much butter.  It was like spreading a thick paste into the pie plate.  I didn't find it too sweet like many others commented, but if I make it again I'll cut down on the butter.

I will never buy a graham cracker crust again! this took less time than going to the store, was cheaper, and was 100 times better than the store bought kind!  My boyfriend said it was better than his granny's...now THAT is a compliment!

the taste was exceptional... usually i don't bake my graham cracker crusts but decided to give it a try this time.  the result was DEE-lish! it almost tastes like a toffee candy my grandmother makes with graham crackers (YUM!).  my only complaint is that when cut the crust seemed more crumbly.  oh! forgot to mention that i followed the recipe exactly (minus the cinnamon).  :)

A simple, but excellent graham cracker crust.  I find that 9 full crackers is just about 1 1/2 cups.  This crust comes out perfect every time I make it.  Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Buttery goodness. My boyfriends favorite pie crust ever. Sometimes I add another 1/4 to the recipe simply to have it thicker. Also, if you think you would rather just go the pre-made route DONT because you can avoid hydrogenated oils this way. Just make sure the graham crackers you choose to get dont have them in it.

I always make my own and this recipe works well.  If you always have bought store bought ones, try a homemade one and you will never buy one in the store again.  These have a lot of flavor and the store ones are always so bland.

This recipe did not work out for me at all, my pie crust turned into graham cracker crust. I did another recipe with 1 1/4c graham crackers and 1/4c butter which turned out marvelously.

Very good, although I did have to double the recipe to get enough to make a cheesecake in a standard springform pan. Had some leftover, but wouldn't have had enough with just one recipe.

So easy and delicious.  Does not even compare to store bought!  hint--combine graham crackers and sugar before you add the butter.  The first time I made it I added everything all at once, and it didn't combine as well.  I used one paper pkg of graham crackers and it was just right.

This recipe was too soggy.  It tasted great, but the texture was chewy and the crust wouldn't go up the sides of the pan to form a full crust since the mixture had so much butter and made the crust too heavy to stay up.

Made the recipe with the same measurements, but I didn't have any white sugar, so I used lt. brown.  Still tasted great with the key lime pie.  Much better than store bought and if you have a food processor it is lickety-split easy.

I love this crust recipe. It's simple and holds up well. I use it for all my cheesecakes, and for various cheesecake flavors, it is easy to substitute other cookies/crackers for different crusts (chocolate grahams, gingersnaps, etc). If you keep the crumbs roughly at 1.5 cups, the recipe works well with these substitutions. I also use this recipe for "pre-baked" crusts, for Lemon Meringue or cream pies (which I think taste much better with graham crusts!). Thanks for this recipe!

excellent and easy. I bought the already crushed gram crackers so i didn't have to crush them myself, and it worked wonderfully! I was afraid the center would be soggy, but it wasnt!
also-make sure to put it in the fridge for about an hour. It helped alot!

Very good graham cracker crust. I used it for the Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake. I had to increase the ingredients for 12 servings and found that it had to bake for at least 15 minutes extra, just because it wasn't very crisp yet. The overall flavor complimented the cheesecake very well, maybe even a little bland but sometimes that works well with pies. ALSO, i added about half an egg to the mixture to make sure that it would stick together well and not crumble too much. A very reliable and simple crust :)

I made the recipe exactly as written (except for using crushed digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers, which we don't have here in Spain). I made it to use with a no-bake cheesecake and it turned out fine. The crust held up and didn't crumble when filled, cut, etc. and the taste is also good (although I will definitely leave out the optional cinnamon next time).

My recipe didn't call for a pre-baked crust, so I baked this with my filling for the time on the pie recipe.  It turned HARD AS A ROCK (even with a juicy filling!)  Maybe this would be better with unbaked, cream pies.

I omitted the cinnamon because I did not think it would compliment my filling.  The crust was good, but didn't pack down as hard as I would have liked.  My filling required some spreading and I had some of the crust start to pull up while spreading.

This was my first attempt at a graham cracker crust. It was very easy, and very fast. I added the optional cinnamon. The amount of cinnamon was just enough to give the crust a special flavor without overpowering. Thanks Carol.

I'll never buy another pre-made! IF you have a food processor this is super easy. And even if you need to rush crumbs in zip-lock with rolling pins, still not that hard. I like a bit of a lip on the back edge of my pie for appearances (though on the other hand you lose some filling space) so I up the crumbs to 2 cups and I keep the sugar the same. It holds together well for cutting, though to insure against any stickage I do put the finest film of butter  in glass pie plate.  (The first time I made this I had a couple spots stick but who knows if that was my pressing too much or uneven butter in it or what. This time I did use my hands to mix and found that helpful because you want to add butter until it lightly clumps together when you squeeze. (I hear butter amounts in cookie crust can vary a bit depending on weather/humidity etc) You don't want any more than you must have or crust will be greasy. I have also done half and half brown and white sugar on occasion. 6 of one half dozen.

I used this recipe and it turned out great! Everyone seemed to enjoy the pie and a huge part of that was because of the crust. I had several people asking me for the recipe. I used a little less sugar and needed more butter. The pie wasn't quite sticking together the way it should with the amount of butter listed. I used about 2 Tbs more. Also, I was low on graham crackers so used some ritz crackers in its place which I actually loved because it kept the crust from being overly sweet! I'll definitely use this one again.

Perfection! We doubled the recipe to be sure we could completely fill and oversized pie dish and we had just the right amount. We used the crust to make a chocolate cream pie, using a recipe from All Recipes, which included homemade whipped cream for the top layer. Pie was amazing!

Our vegan daughter joined us for Thanksgiving and I managed to make every recipe a vegan recipe except the turkey breast. For this one, I used homemade vegan butter (quick and easy to make) and organic sugar (who knew that regular sugar is made with charred animal bones? Yech!).  This graham cracker crust turned out perfectly and the vegan peanut butter pie filling for it was also a hit!

My ten-year-old grandson (who lives several hours away) and I made this together using Skype .... I guided him through the process after making it myself.  It was easy and a perfect blend of ingredients -- we loved it, and then used it to create a Mint Chocolate Cream Pie that was ultra-delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly, then tried to make a baked pie in it.  It stuck to the sides of the pan, and was as hard as a rock.

I make this all the time now because it is so easy & very good.  One "sleeve" of graham crackers equals 1.5 cups of crumbs.  I just grind them up in the food processor.  I've made it with & without the cinnamon depending on what type of pie I am making & it turns out perfect every time.

This recipe is absolutely perfect. Don't change a thing. But you CAN substitute other crumbs, crushed gingersnaps, vanilla wafers, Ritz, saltines or cereal like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

I skipped the cinnamon since I was making a Key Lime Pie.  I also found that, thanks to my grandmother, I have an 8 1/2 in pie plate to.  I lined the 9" with the crust mixture and used the 8 1/2" one to press it down, making it perfectly even.  If your crust sticks, set the plate in hot water for a few second before cutting.

I used Cinnamon Sugar HoneyMaid Graham Crackers and with them you don't have to add sugar or cinnamon; it is perfectly already. The crust turned out perfect and the house smells amazin! Now I am just waiting on my homemade pumpkin pie to finish baking!

Quite nice crust.  I used it for my key lime pie and found it to be much nicer than prepared graham cracker crusts.  I've also used it in the past for cheesecake and we loved it then, too.

Great taste, but mine needed more butter. I might try cold butter next time because mine never got crumbly, it never held together. Will try again and report back. Round two I used room temp butter and mixed it by hand. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup of white sugar. I would just slightly up the cinnamon, but I made this for the double layer pumpkin cheesecake on this website so since the pumpkin is spiced, I didn’t but add more to the crust.

I made this for the Chocolate Cream pie II recipe here on AR, topped with swiss meringue.  I was told the crust was exquisite.  I smashed 2 packs of Honey Maid graham crackers for a 9 inch Pyrex pie plate, and I had a bit of crumbs left over after measuring 1 1/2 cups.  The only thing I did differently was just a tiny bit of cinnamon.  I was worried because the crust really shrunk during baking but I had no time to make another one...didn't matter, the crust was still fabulous, but next time I might use a bit less butter or all the graham cracker crumbs I made.

My crust turned out chewy and tough... not like a graham cracker crust should be. I tried leaving it the oven for an extra amount of time but it just didn't seem to help. Don't know why this happened, everyone else seems satisfied with their turnout.

For me this was the perfect ratio of butter to cookie crumbs, I've tried a few recipes using up to twice the amount of butter and they always turn out greasy and hard.  I only had tea biscuits in the pantry so I eliminated the sugar altogether (the biscuits are quite sweet).  I got enough out of it to get around halfway up the sides of a 9 inch round spring form pan.  I used it for key lime pie so I didn't use the cinnamon and pre-baked it.  It came out firm enough to hold together when cut yet wasn't too hard to cut with a cake fork, definitely a good one.

Perfect. Used food processor to grind graham crackers to perfect consistency. Used this for the Key Lime Pie VII (make it), which didn't quite go all the way to the top of this crust in my pie plate. Doesn't matter - it was all delicious!

I usually buy the pre-made graham cracker crusts, but after having tried this one, I won't be doing so any longer!  This homemade version tasted way better!  I baked it and it provided just the right amount of crunch for my Key Lime pie.

This crust is the first one I haven't been able to screw up! It was nice and thick, easy to cut and had a great flavor. I used cinnamon graham crackers and it went perfectly with a pumpkin cheesecake that I made. Great recipe!

I made this recipe and I don't know what 433 people were thinking!!! I was so disappointed, it was crumbling! Mind you, the graham crackers were finely destroyed to dust to get this right and yet what I pulled out of the oven seven minutes later was definitely not a crust.

Great, easy pie crust!  I should have used a bit larger pie pan.  The recipe makes plenty for a nice sized pie crust!

I use this as a base in cheesecakes with wine biscuits. I measure out the butter once melted. Tastes great and holds together quite well.

Easy and quick. Only graham cracker crust you will need. I do decrease sugar to 1/4 cup as there is no reason to use any more than that.

Six tablespoons is way too much butter!  
I halved the amount of butter called for and added a little water to make up for the dryness and it still ended up tasting like cookie rather than crust.  Tasty, but I definitely did not need the additional calories.

Made this with a cheesecake for my boyfriend's birthday (he requested graham cracker crust). He loved it, and it was super easy to make - just put in my food processor. Used 2 packages of crackers, 6 Tbsp butter, a hearty amount of cinnamon, and 1/2 c sugar (estimated on the crackers, couldn't find my 1/3 c measuring cup). It worked great. Not too sweet or cinnamon. Was perhaps a little dry with the extra crackers. Made way more than I needed for the sides and bottom of a springform pan.

Really liked this!  It had a perfect texture and was very tasty.  I also used it for a pumpkin cream pie at Thanksgiving and swapped the cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice and it was equally delicious.  A keeper for me!!

Deserves 5+ stars! Followed recipe to a T and used it for "Key Lime Pie VII" on this site. My husband absolutely raved about the crust! I think he would have eaten it plain! :) Will definitely use again and again!

Simple and delicious. I like to bake it slightly before filling.

I made this for a lemon icebox pie and it tasted great. I'll definitely use this recipe any time I need a graham cracker crust.

I made this with coarse sugar (turbinado) since it was all I had on hand and the extra crunchiness was delightful, I'll make it the same way from now on. I also added a dash of ginger powder instead of cinnamon.

I was using this crust for a Key Lime Pie so I omitted the cinnamon and I used brown sugar, mainly because I was out of white sugar. I actually liked it better was the brown sugar so I will be using that for now on.

Perfect, simple recipe for a graham cracker crust!  One package in the food processor, add sugar then drizzle in melted butter through the top.  This also works great with chocolate grahams when you need a chocolate crust.

The taste was great.  Easy to make with ingredients on hand. My only suggestion would be to make sure you spread the crumbs out evenly.  It was difficult to cut through thicker spots.

I loved this. I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful. I could eat just this for a dessert! I honestly won't buy pre-made crust again. There is no reason to with this being so easy. It turned out so nice and crunchy and stayed crunchy without crumbling. Very nice.

GREAT recipe! I was hesitant to add cinnamon but it was a great touch! The recipe made plenty for my 9" pie plate and had some leftover. I used one package of Honey Keebler graham crackers.

Good recipe but you DO NOT need the sugar!  Graham crackers have plenty of sugar to begin with.  I usually take 1 1/2 packages of graham crackers and put them in the food processor.  I pulse the food processor then gently stream in the melted butter and the mixture comes together nicely.  i then use the le creuset plastic spatula to soon it over the pie dish.  I bake for 8 minutes.  Then i usually follow with key lime pie - - delish!

I've been toying with this one for awhile. I think I prefer this with an additional tablespoon of butter, and I cook it for about an extra minute and a half.  I also use cinnamon graham crackers.

This is definitely a keeper recipe!  It's so tasty, and so much better than store bought.  As graham crackers aren't available in the UK, I used digestive biscuits, but the taste is just the same.  Thanks!

Thanks. I made as described with a bit more butter because it would not stick together. For the pie I put mixed two packages of pudding and three cups milk. Quick, simple, tasty.

I used cinnamon Honey Made graham crackers and then didn't add extra cinnamon. I also added about 2 extra tablespoons of butter, because it just seemed like it was too crumbly beforehand. I didn't have a 9 in pie pan, so used a 9 inch round cake pan- which worked fine. My Honey Made graham crackers came in three packets, and it took 1 1/2 packets to make the required amount of crumbs. A previous reviewer said it took just one pack, so my packs must be smaller. Next time I will try less butter and will use plain graham crackers. It was good, but was really sweet and rich. A great, easy, basic recipe though. No need for ready made crusts!

Great crust - I agree with others, it's a bit crumbly in consistency but, great overall.   Next time: might add a bit more butter to solidify the crust so when I cut it, it won't entirely fall into crumbs again.

This recipe worked out well for a summer berry and cool whip pie that I decided to make at the last minute. I didn't have a prepared crust, but had all the ingredients on hand to make this crust from scratch. The only change I made was that I used Splenda instead of white sugar to cut the calories out. It came out great!

I could eat this crust mixture with a spoon, yum!  I used Smart Balance instead of butter.  I changed it to 12 servings to make enough for a 9x13 pan, I probably could have just doubled and pushed it up the sides more.  I'm using this crust to  make the Freezer Caramel Drizzle Pie on this site.  I will definitely use this crust again, maybe just to snack on raw;)

It tastes sooo good, but its a lot of work to press it into the dish. It didn't seem to stick right in the pan, so I ended up adding butter to help, but I think that just made it too greasy. So I baked it a bit longer, and probably overcooked it. Pie crusts are not my forte, but like i said, it was delicious.

I would scale it back a bit as it was a little much for my 9 inch pie plate. Very tasty however.

this is super delicious and easy! a little browning at the edges is good but it still needs to have a bit of softness to it that way its not completely hard when its cool. i definitely recommend putting in the cinnamon; its so good! =]

Absolutely delicious!!! This is not only super simple to make but it is also thick and tasty. My husband, friends and family loved this in conjunction with Key lime Pie VII.  **I mixed brown and white sugar instead of all white sugar**

Great crust! It got messy crushing the graham crackers, but well worth it. I did not add cinnamon and I used it with a peanut butter pie.

Made a few of these last night for the pies I was baking. First one fell apart, I'd never made a crumb crust before and had to get the hang of it. I tossed it and tried again, this time turned out great! These are so yummy, I'll definitely not bother with another store-bought crust. I did end up having to use about another T of butter to get it stick together well. No biggie.

I love this crust. I divided it out into individual servings by using cupcake liners in a muffin pan (makes about 24). I used honey graham crackers and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. After cooking and cooling, I filled with the "Cherry Cheesecake" recipe (leaving space for the fruit topping). I found that assembling completely a FULL day ahead of time rendered the best results. The crust was neither too hard nor too soft; it was just right.

Great recipe. Very VERY VERY easy too! Mine didn't quiet cover the whole pan though. Adding a dash of salt makes all the difference. This will be my new graham crust recipe. Taste way better than the store bought kind.

Excellent crust. This is soooo much better than the premade ones you buy. I did not use the cinnamon. This made enough for a 9-inch deep dish pie pan. I'll use this again. I had trouble getting this out of the dish when serving and it stuck to the pan and crumbled. Very tasty though. Thanks Carol, this was so fast and easy.

Great recipe.  I added more graham cracker b/c I had a 10" pie plate.  I accidentally added 1 Cup of sugar, but nothing is too sweet for me and my hubby.  The cinnamon was nice...it reminds me a lot of the flavor of Nabisco's Honey Graham Sticks cinnamon flavor.  Will use again!

I love the way this crust tastes. HOWEVER, I don't recommend prebaking. I tried it for a fridge pie that called for a prebaked crust and it melted down the sides of the pie plate due to the butter. I used real butter.  I was able to save it though. I just pulled it out of the oven, let it cool a little and reshaped.  It came out fine.

I have had a lot of success with this graham cracker crust.  The cinnamon gives it a nice flavor.

Easy to make and tastes good.  (didn't use the cinnamon) Only problem is the pie crust shrinks when baked.  I made it with a greased and ungreased pie pan and it happened both times.

This dough was so crumbly I couldn't roll it flat. I would reccommend using real butter instead of shortening

To make this recipe gluten free just use gluten free graham crackers. If you are making something that requires an 8 x 10 crust double the recipe.

I made it with half regular and half cinnamon flavored Honey Maid graham crackers and it was delicious!! I made it with pumpkin pie - so good!! Since I had to bake the pumpkin pie, I chilled the crust for an hour before putting the filling in and baking it. I think that was a good choice, if I had baked it first I think it would have burned but the way I did it made it perfectly crisp and yummy

This is exactly the crust I've been looking for.  Sweet and Buttery Graham Cracker Crust.  There is just something about the savory sweet taste that makes this curst the best part of any desert.  I followed instructions exactly as written.

Very good as made in the recipe but much much too sweet for a pie crust.  The 2nd time I halved the sugar and it was still a bit too sweet (and I have one raging sweet tooth!) Next time I make I'll reduce the sugar just a touch more.  I also sprayed the glass pie pan with PAM and had no trouble with the crust sticking.  Thank you for this recipe!  It's a winner!!!!

I made this with the ziplock bag method many reviewers mentioned, however - the crackers still had tiny lumps - I think I'll use my food processor next time and then add it to a bag to help sort the butter for mixing.

I used it for a Banana Cream pie, came out delicious!

Thought the crust was great and had a nice crumbly texture I liked, except I did not like the (optional) cinnamon. If I was making something with peaches or apples, that may work well, but with the cherry dessert I filled it with, cinnamon did not support the flavor.  Still, I'll definitely use this recipe again minus the cinnamon. The only other thing I will do differently is spray or grease the pie dish first. My crust seemed to stick a bit.

Out of all the graham cracker crusts on here, this was the best. Easy to follow, however this recipe was not enough to line a 9” pie pan. I doubled the recipe and that came out perfect. I used Honey Maid crackers. They come in 3 packages. Each package was 1 1/2 cups. I used 2 packages. I used an electric food processor to grind the graham crackers to a fine crust consistency. A fork would never do. Once done, I transferred the crackers to a KitchenAid counter electric mixer and mixed all the ingredients. Make sure butter is very soft if not melted. Medium speed worked well. I then did not bake the crust. I left the cooking time up to the cooking when the banana cream filling was in and the whip topping was applied for browning. The pie turned out great. Double the batch and you’ll be good to go.

I have made this crust a few times now.  It's easy and a great recipe.   I just had to cut back the sugar as we thought it was too sweet using 1/3 cup.  I put maybe 3 teaspoons of sugar and it comes out just right.  I have used it to make a larger version in a rectangular pan of one of our favorite pies to bring to school or potlucks.

I made the crust exactly as stated.  It did not hold together and was a  too sweet.  Also I would have like a little thicker crust.  Next time I will use 2 c. crumbs, 1/2 c. melted butter. and 1/4 c. of firmly packed light brown sugar.  This is on another pie recipe that I have, and it always turns out great.

I make this crust  to create the "bottom" of my Elephant Bars.  I bake it as directed, and it doesn't crumble and fall to pieces when cutting the bars to serve - holds up really well.

Yummy recipe! You need to measure the ground graham crackers. Crust on the right was incorrect when 1 package of crackers used. Crust on the left turned out great when crumbs measured (about 1.5 packages)

I used cinnamon graham crackers so I didn't have to add cinnamon. I put it in the bottom of a 9x13 pan and it fit fine.
It baked up nice and fluffy and smelling great. I am adding a filling as soon as it is cool enough. I will make this again for sure.

So good! I made it even easier by pulsing one package of Honey Maid graham crackersin the blender, then adding the other ingredients. I added extra cinnamon and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup. I couldn't stop snacking on it!

Great recipe! I thought it would be perfect to modify as we didn’t have graham crackers nor crumbs. My replacement ingredient was granola. As the granola already has honey & brown sugar, all it needed was the melted butter. 1.5 cups granola, 3 tbsp butter (melted) at 375 degrees F for 7 minutes. They turned out wonderfully & the perfect crust for my no banana custard. I’ve saved this & will definitely use it.

I have made this many times and love it! I usually make this crust to make key lime pie. So much better than store bought pie crust! I have also substituted with gluten-free graham crackers for my daughter who is celiac and works fine as well.

This is great as is, but I use 1/2 white and  1/2 brown sugar and I also add chopped fine pecans to the crust mix and it makes the crust able to handle N Y Cheese Cake, do not cook before you add the cheese cake mix to bake all at once.

Perfect amount of crumbs for a nice puffy edged crust as opposed to a skimpy, just reaches the edge crusts. 
I omitted the cinnamon for my “Magic Lemon Pie” on this site. TY??

Nice easy recipe. Came out great. I forgot the cinnamon, which I'm sure would make it even more amazing. I used this recipe for mini cheesecakes. They were yummy!

Perfect for when your in a rush.  I ended up preparing cheese cake filling before my crust so this was definitely a simple, as well as quick to prepare recipe.

I'm not sure what all the 5-star ratings are all about.  This recipe contains about 3 times the butter needed to make graham cracker crust.  I had to add about 2 more cups of cracker crumbs and had a ton of it left over.

I should have read the reviews and added less sugar. MUCH LESS sugar. I've read other recipes that only use 3 tbs. The fact that this one calls for 1/3 is crazy! Oh, and I needed an extra tsp of butter because it did not seem "sticky" enough to hold together.Next time I'll use much less sugar and an extra tbs of butter.

Yum!!  Went great with a homemade Key Lime Pie!  I didn't include the cinnamon, as I didn't think it's necessary and the one time I did add it, it left odd look specks in the crust.

This was an excellent graham cracker crust.  I used honey grahams and other than cutting the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp., made no other changes.  I used it for a key lime pie and it was perfect.  Happy Granny

I used this crust for OKBEE's Strawberry Pie II, here on allrecipes and it was delicious!  I didn't change anything and it came out great : ) Baking the crust before using it is a MUST (the consistency does change  - the crust  seems to set and gets less crumbly).   Thanks for the recipe!

I did not have butter so I used Country Crock .  This was not a good choice as it made it very gooey so I added more grahm cracker.  It came out very thick more like a chewy cookie than a crust. Next time I will use real butter and add it slowly in.

This recipe came out perfect & delicious.  I used Honey Maid graham crackers and crumbed them in a food processor.  I added the rest of the ingredients in the food processor and blended it up.  Pressed into a 9” pie pan.  It was so quick and easy.  I used the crust for Key Lime Pie.  SOOOO GOOD.  Will use recipe again.

Delicious, and held up very well under a baked cheesecake recipe. Make sure to add the recommended amount of butter - I ran short, and my crust was just tiniest bit crumbly. Still great, and I'll be using this recipe from here on!

I made this recipe for a chocolate cream pie recipe as I thought the graham crust would be nicer than the baked pie dough crust which has no sweetness to it.  I used my food processor to fine-grind my package of Honey Maid graham wafers (one of the three wrapped packages and then used two more wafers as it was a bit under the one and a half cups and I used a 9.45" pie pan.   I used my food processor again and mixed the melted butter,  sugar (used a bit less as the Honey Maid  wafers are now sweetened),  cornstarch, salt & cocoa into the wafer crumbs in two winks and then it went into the pie plate with a few taps of the back of a large spoon.  Baked the 7 minutes.  So easy and it is super delicious!  This one's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing it!!!

Way too much butter in this recipe! It made the graham crumbs super soggy and even after baking there was butter sitting on top of the crust. The next time I made it I cut the butter in half which made it almost perfect. I’d maybe use brown sugar instead of white next time too

Easiest recipe ever. Baking is unlike all other forms of cooking in that you have to measure. The suggestion to use a single pack of Nabisco grahams didn't work for me - I only came up with 1-1/4 cups, so I had to add more grahams crackers. Measure, measure, measure, and this will be spot on.

Pretty easy to make and tastes great.  Works very well with a Key Lime pie.  

A few points.  

If you use Nabisco Graham crackers, it takes nine sheets (27 individual crackers), which is perfect because that is exactly the number in each individually wrapped bag in the box.  

Also, you really want to mix very well.  Do not shortcut this step.  And when you press the mixture into the pan, make sure to press well around the bottom edge to get a well defined transition between the sides and bottom.  

Finally, if you bake it like I did, figure on cooling it for about an hour before filling it and baking your pie.

This is the perfect graham cracker crust. I did 1 1/2 times as I had a larger pie plate and bigger filling, and it worked well too.

I converted this never fail classic to VEGAN by using vegan arrowroot cookies and some rolled oats and pulverized to a fine crumb. Substituted coconut oil for butter.  Baked it the same and it came out beautifully!

Best crust ever!  I quadrupled it, to fit 2 - 9x12 pans. I also added 2 packs of chopped pecans to the food processor. The recipe quadrupled is 2 tsp cinnamon 1-1/3 cups of sugar, to  6 cups (4 sleeves) of Graham crackers in the food processor. Pulsed to a moderately fine crumb and emptied into a medium mixing bowl. Then, I lightly melted 3 sticks of salted butter in the microwave,  in a glass measuring cup, poured it over the crumb mixture, and stirred to combine. Into two pyrex baking dishes, I divided the mixture equally and pressed evenly along the bottom of the bottom of each pan. I baked

Easy to make, and absolutely delicious.  I don't understand why anyone would buy a graham cracker crust when this is so easy and so much tastier! My 7 year-old loved the cinnamon.

I have already made a crust with the graham crackers but I had bought a large tin of  short bread cookies from Cosco and did not like them but I couldn't take them back because I live to far and was only visiting when I purchased the cookies. I was thinking besides crunching them up and giving to the birds I would use them for a crust for banana pudding and it came out great!! The graham cracker crust is also wonderful.

I used Nabisco Grahams (the red box), it takes 13 crackers, I used my food processor to grind them up & used the listed amount of sugar & better.  I have made this crust before it is always great.  Today I made it for a refrigerator pumpkin  pie with cool whip for Thanksgiving.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice & 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg before I added the butter, just a little added Holiday taste.

Amazing!! I subbed half the white sugar for brown sugar (2 Tb plus 2 tsp brown sugar and 2 Tb plus 2 tsp white sugar) as per someone else's suggestion and totally recommend it! This brings any graham cracker crusted pie to the next level. Definitely a keeper!!

This graham cracker crust was delicious!  Easy to make and perfect with a key lime filling.  I did reduce the surface amount a little.

Wonderful recipe! Easy and quick with very nice flavor. Paired it with the microwave lemon curd recipe on this site. Perfect!
Thanks very much for this recipe.
Update 11/27/18  Have made this recipe many times and both my husband and I love it! Made it last night for a pumpkin pie. Really delicious, simple to put together using everyday pantry shelf items. Thanks again!

This is my go to graham cracker crust recipe for Key Lime Pie. I love cinnamon and use cinnamon graham crackers along with the added cinnamon in the recipe.

I'm an experienced baker and this is unfortunately not a good crust at all. It was to wet couldn't spread it, it was way to gooey. When I went to bake it it was still very wet and by the time I got it baked it was rock hard. I do not recommend this and will not use it again.

I really messed this recipe up because my crust was too thick! Use a thin layer of graham crackers and lube the bottom of your pan up or it will suck BIG TIME!

I make this crust exactly as the recipe says.  It was so greasy from the butter when I bake it it just turned to mush.  Kind of like a mud pie.  It was the worst graham crust I ever saw.  
Definitely would not recommend it.

I made the recipe with small 6" pie dishes.  It was very tasty and I used it with yogurt and cool whip pie filling.  It was a great combo.  I liked the cinnamon too.

I replaced the graham crackers with 2 cups of KinniKritters chocolate animal cookies (kinnikinnick foods from Albertson's) to make this a gluten-free (and chocolate) version.  It worked great!

So good! I use a little more butter and about 1/3 of the butter salted, really brings out the flavor! Hand mixing it, works a little better for me as well, just make sure it's mixed all the way. But over all this is a really simple and fast recipe that turns out just as good as any complicated recipe would, I use it with key lime pie an it turns out absolutely amazing!

Easy to make and delicious!  This tastes better than the store bought crusts. Next time I make it, I will cut back on the sugar  a bit and depending on the pie filling, I may cut the cinnamon. This is a deliciously rich graham cracker crust!

I made an Amish Ice Box Peanut Butter pie that called for a regular baked pie shell.  I made it with this graham cracker crust and baked it at 375 degrees for only 4 min.  The slight baking really made the crust hold up great and not stiff at all.

I made this last Thanksgiving  Nov 2016, my house of men quickly decided this is the crust they preferred me to use with my pumpkin cheesecake pie.
I typically double the recipe (do add the cinnamon)  but bake for additional 5+ minutes (I'm not high altitude) and pie comes out perfect.
This crust has the perfect amount of crunch with a slight buttery taste, which is a winner in my house to 3 grown boys and my husband who are quick to tell me what recipes to stop making (LOL).
I'm making these for my son in college per his request for Pi Day March 14, 2017.
This is a keeper.
The only thing I did differently was add enough graham crackers to take crust up the sides of the pan.

I followed the directions exactly and used a 9 inch pie dish.  The graham crackers were swimming in butter after baking for 7 minutes.  The sides shrunk back and so I basically have a lovely smelling disc of mushy graham cracker.  Back to store bought I guess.  Very disappointed

Tasted great!  Quick and easy to put together. I used gluten free graham crackers to make a gluten free sugar cream pie. It went over very well!

Simple, easy and delicious!  Made as my crust for a pumpkin cheesecake.   Went with the option to add cinnamon and it turned out great!  No leftovers.

This is now a family favorite. Makes a simple pudding pie something special. On second round I did add an extra TBSP of butter.

My grandparents are visiting for Thanksgiving, so we decided to make a pumpkin pie with graham cracker crust. We followed the recipe to the letter. I finished mixing it together and showed them how it turned out, and they said that there was way too much butter. I had to add an additional packet of graham crackers to fix it, and it was still too butterey :( Next time I'll have to add about 3 or 4 tsp of butter!

Perfect! Didn't change a thing. Crushed the crackers in a gallon sized baggie using my rolling pin. After mixing ingredients, I used the bottom and side of a metal measuring cup to press the graham cracker tight into the pie plate. Great recipe!

Perfect quantities. I used biscuits instead of graham crackers. To make things easier, I put the butter into the pan and placed it in the preheated oven - it melted in two minutes, and saved on cleanup. I pre-baked for ten minutes before putting in the custard filling, which worked well. This had the perfect sweetness and crunch.

Upped Graham crackers to 2 cups & butter to 9 tbsp's crust finished more substantial. Also added 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg jazzed the flavor. After lining pie pan or plate with crust chilling for an hr in fridge & the extra butter helps prevent the crust from becoming too hard  during the baking. But overall nothing beats a homemade graham cracker crust!

I love this crust! Once you bake it, it becomes crispy, which I think is perfect! I would definitely make this again, as it is great for any type of pie! I only had Cinnamon Graham Crackers, so I used those instead of the extra cinnamon this recipe calls for, and it works just as well!

I used Biscoff cookies (yes the same that Delta gives out on flights) instead of graham crackers and freshly ground nutmeg instead of cinnamon. The best for citrus pies.

Superb.  This is my go-to for key lime and cheesecake.  Though for any other desert, I will opt for a crust made from Pepperidge Farm's Chessmen cookies.

I have made this before and it is always great.  This time however; after I started making it, my daughter told me she wanted chocolate crust.  
I just added about 1/4 cup of unsweetened powdered cocoa.  It is so delicious.

I made the recipe as directed, including the optional cinnamon, and baked it before pouring my filling into it.  I used this crust to make the "Key Lime Pie VII".  I thought the crust was a just a bit too sweet, especially with the sweetened condensed milk in the key lime pie.  With that said, my kids loved it and ate the whole pie in a day.

Not enough crumbs for the amount of butter called for. Also
not enough crumbs to cover pie pan, thin with holes. Turned out soupy in bottom due to too much butter so I threw it out and tried again with more crumbs, 2 1/4 C. Use what you need, pitch what you don't.
Sugar was correct for Graham crackers with less sugar in them.
Second time I made it I used a store brand and it tasted too sweet. More sugar in store brand.
Overall I was not impressed.

Great crust. Go ahead and throw the whole stick of butter in. Seriously. This is a fantastic crust and my go to every time for graham cracker crust. Note: It does matter what brand of crackers you use. Honey Maid has been the best for me. I am a 99% organic cook, but I cheat with the Honey Grahams.

The crust didn't hold together as well as I'd hoped, and I made the mistake of using honey graham cracker crumbs AND adding the sugar. Next time, less sugar, and maybe a few less crumbs.

I tried this recipe twice. Once following the directions exactly and again without baking it off first. Both times it has become hard and crystallized on me. maybe to much sugar and butter.

Let me just say that I am not fond of graham crackers but I was making a banana cream pie and didn't have the ingredients for anything else. OMG! This crust was amazing! Everybody that ate the pie wouldn't stop raving about it. It had a great flavor and was super easy to make.

I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup and could even cut back further. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon because I didn't want an overwhelming cinnamon flavor. It worked fine, but maybe will try the full amount next time. It went perfectly with the Italian Cream Cheese and Ricotta Cheesecake from this site that I made. This would be a great crust for any type of sweet dish! Thanks Carol!

Perfect!  No changes made to this recipe, except that from reading other ratings from folks who thought it was too moist, I was just a wee shy with the butter.  I loved it!   I'll keep this recipe always!

I added a little bit of vanilla extract. I can be a little challenging to form but as long as you get the surfaces covered, it bakes just fine. :) I will certainly use this again!

I doubled this recipe and it's way way to much butter. I don't what I did wrong but it's just a bubbly mess. :( I guess the only good thing is the amazing smell! lol

My 8-year-old son made this, but he accidentally added too much graham, so the crust didn't stick together. Even so, the taste was incredible! This will definitely be our go-to crust from now on.

This recipe was entirely too crumbly for my taste--I have made this twice now, cutting back on the sugar and upping the cinnamon both times.  I honestly think this would hold better with a little bit more butter, but I ended up finding a better graham cracker crust recipe that actually holds together off of another cheesecake recipe.  I used this one again on a whim--because I couldn't find the other recipe and I was pressed for time--as as usual, I was disappointed.  There is a crumbly mess all over my counters from divvying up my cheesecake.

This turned out perfect and went perfect with the key lime pie I made.  I got over the top compliments for our friends we had over for dinner.  I will never buy a pre-made crust and will always use this with my key lime pie.

My Honey Made crackers already had cinnamon so I added nutmeg instead and found that combining the crumbs with cold butter instead of melted butter helps keep it together better. (no baking or 1 hour waits) other than that, great recipe :)

Awesome, awesome recipe! I usually buy store made crust but I recently got a food processor (I know, welcome to the 20th century lol) so I thought I'd try to make a homemade crust for a peanut butter pie I was making for a 4th of July BBQ. I used chocolate graham crackers but followed everything else exactly and it was just perfect! I'm definitely not going back to store bought graham cracker crust again!

I made this recipe twice. It makes a fantastic crust, however it was a tad bit too sweet for me. Next time I will cut down the sugar a bit to perhaps just 1/4 of a cup. The cinnamon is a nice touch. It seems to me that the key to a good graham cracker crust is using a good spoon and forming the well across the pie plate so that it isn't too thick or thin in any particular area.

Like the simple recipe. Though for my taste that was a lot of butter. Otherwise a great taste and consistency

Bestgraham crust and so easy to make. I will never use a store brought crust again. I used 1 1/2 packs of Honey Maid graham crackers and decreased cinnamon to 1/4 teaspoon - I like a more subtle taste of cinnamon.

Great! Make in food processor. One plastic package of graham crackers(9) is the right amount. I only put in 1/4 cup sugar, plenty. Yum:)

Excellent & easy. Do make sure you use real butter..  Patted it into bottom of greased 8x8 pan & baked at 350 for about 11-12 minutes. Could have ate the whole crust right then,  it was really good!

4.5 Stars, I doubled the recipe and pressed into a 9 x 13 pan.  It was great but very difficult to cut, had to use a metal knife then scraped the bottom of my pan.  Next time I will try to bake it for 6 min instead of 7 and see if it is not as difficult to cut.  It was not difficult to eat though! Very cookie like in texture.  I used cinnamon graham crackers and it had a a great flavor.

I use less sugar but the butter/cracker crumb ratio is perfect on this.  Some try to skimp on the butter and this is delicious.  One bag of graham crackers (Honey Maid boxes come with 3 bags inside) is just the right amount.

I used this recipe for a strawberry pie. I followed the directions to the letter but found it difficult to cut and it didn't want to come up out of the pie pan without a fight. Baker's Joy next time, for an easier release from the pie pan. Otherwise, it was delicious.

The crust had a pool of butter when I just took it out of the oven.  It was really sweet and buttery, and did not hold together well as a pie crust should.

A simple delicious crust! I used 1 1/2 sleeves of mi-del brand honey Grahams (all natural, whole wheat), and left out the cinnamon, as I wasn't sure how that would go with the key lime pie I was making. Ground up the crackers I'm my blender, and mixed it up right in the pan. Baked for the 7 minutes, and for another 10 minutes with filling after it cooled. It wasn't overdone, and tasted great! Thanks for a great, easy recipe. Can't believe I ever bought a graham cracker crust now that I know how simple they aren't to make.

Great recipe. I omitted the cinnamon and used it with Key Lime Pie VII from this site. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bake it beforehand or not, so I did anyway (I was impatient and didn't want to wait an hour, honestly), and it doesn't appear to have done any damage. Easy to make, easy to form, is keeping its shape, and tastes great. All in all, I was pleases to discover that my fear of graham cracker crusts is unfounded. I'll be keeping this one.

Rally good flavor.  I usually don't like graham cracker crust. I did double the cinnamon and add vanilla.  It's definitely way too much butter.  I used it for tart shells, and I kept having to press it down during baking because the butter would puff it up, and I am not sure the bottom will firm up like I want, but the sides were browning so I didn't want them to be too crispy.

Perfect.  I ground my crumbs up very fine in my Vitamix.  Because the crumbs were so small, I needed 1.5 packages of the crackers, but I liked the texture and delicious taste.

This works better for me the second time when I did not cook it first of a pie that gets cooked.

I had always used a prepared graham cracker crust with my coconut cream pie and thought the crust was simply the crust.  This past Thanksgiving I made my pie and found I had no crust so in a panic searched and found this recipe.  This pie crust ROCKS!  It made my pie and with the addition of this crust was perhaps the best coconut cream pie to date.  Also, as I have now made this crust on multiple occasions, I would highly recommend adding the cinnamon as it compliments the crust perfectly!

Came out great! I used a little less sugar, and I still think it came out a little sweet. I think the problem may have been that I was using graham crackers that were already sweetened? I don't know. Anyways, I used this for my coconut cream pie and it was perfect.

I made this as written for a pumpkin pie. It was so easy to make, and so much more delicious than store bought pie shells! It also came out of the pie plate perfectly, and not crumbly like other crusts.

OMG this recipe was a lifesaver.  I already had my Chocolate Cream pie filling simmering when I accidently broke the Chocolate Graham crust that I had purchased from the store. I found this recipe and whipped it together in less than 20 minutes. Totally saved the desert for my parents anniversary dinner. Amazing taste and perfect for any homemade pie. Only thing I would change is decrease the ingredients just a bit as the crust was a little to thick for my family taste.

I used cinnamon grahams and perhaps used a touch less sugar - added the cinnamon (despite the type of cracker) and it was FAB - everyone here loved it.

The quantities in the recipe are way too much for an 8" pie plate (too thick), so I wasted much of the mixture "thinning" the crust to my liking.  Once that was done, it baked up well (precisely 7 minutes), tasted delicious, and held up after filling with chocolate pudding.  Would make again, with adjustments.

Great recipe! I use this a lot. I omit the cinnamon but keep the rest of the ingredients the same. Removing the cinnamon is just a personal preference I'm sure it is great with it.

This recipe works quite well for a basic graham cracker crust.  I've used these measurements when preparing a chocolate crust as well, with the exception of reducing the sugar to about 1/8 cup.

I found after baking the crust, it came out way to hard. We could not cut through it. I would try the recipe again, but maybe cook it less or at a lower temp (I am also not sure the oven I used is accurate).

I thought that the taste and texture  of the crust was really good, however, I thought that the crust was too thick and could have been reduced by at least 1/3.

One of the best graham cracker crusts I've had.  Used in a citrusy pie so I omitted the cinnamon.  Used in a spring form pan and it worked wonderfully.

4 stars for now just for the ease of creating this! I used 1 package graham crackers, sugar and butter and omitted the cinnamon since this was for banana cream pies... I followed another reviewers suggestions and let the 12 yr old mix it all up in a ziplock bag.  Made enough crust for 2 of my little 6-inch pie dishes...  I'll let you know how it turns out!

This was really just perfect. My first Graham cracker crust and I was so excited/amazed when it turned out so perfectly. This is going into my permanent collection. Today, I'm in the baking mood again, but I'm out of graham crackers, so I'm trying this recipe using ground cereal. Thanks!

Perfect! I didn't have time to refrigerate the crust so I put cold butter into the food processor along with the graham cracker crumbs and it was fine. I used raw sugar, and since the granules were larger than white sugar, it had a very nice crunchy texture.

I just made this for a key lime pie. I increased the amounts slightly, as I like a thicker crust. It turned out awesome. I didn't add the cinnamon for this pie, but I totally will when I make my pumpkin cheesecake in the fall.

Good recipe and easy too. Made a pumpkin pie with this crust and impressed the hostess of the party I took it to. I don't know if she was impressed with the crust, pie, or just the fact that a man could bake a pie!! lol I'll be using this recipe again.

Just what I was looking for; quick and easy. I used a suggestion from another review and combined the ingredients in a gallon sized baggy.

FABULOUS!  Calculated for 12 servings b/c I like a thick crust.  It was PERFECT!  Ran out of graham crackers, so I used vanilla wafers to get the full amount of crumbs.  Had a bit of a chewy texture.... my daughter wants to just eat the crust of the pie, it's so good!  Thank you!  A MUST make again!

Awesome!  Super easy--I only softened my butter instead of melting.  Don't know if that made a difference in consistency when prepping, but it was very tasty!

Doubled this recipe, used half graham crackers and half gingersnaps and pressed into a 9x13 where it made a solid 3/4 inch crust.  Will certainly use again as it got several compliments from potluck guests and my family.  Thanks!

I may have used too much butter for this one.  The crust came out tasting fine, but it was a little mushy and sort of slid down the sides of the pie plate... very weird.

Not very happy with it, will try a different one next time.  It didn't taste bad, but it was crumbly and people said it (the pie crust in specific) was okay, but.... then they made that face...

I will never, ever buy another store bought pie crust again!  This pie crust had so much flavor.  I think what really did it was the cinnamon.  The texture was perfect, too--just make sure not to overbake.  This was the best pie crust I have ever tasted!

I absolutely love this crust!! I use it for absolutely anything that requires a graham cracker crust! It's definately the best I've ever tasted. And the recipe says that the cinnamon is optional, but it absolutely is not! You must add the cinnamon!!

It was an easy crust. Nothing real special about it. I would suggest baking it in the oven for 5-10 minutes before using it for your pie.

This is a great crust... I made it for a key lime pie. I did add the optional cinnamon, as well as a 1/4 tsp of salt (I had only unsalted butter). The only issue was that it didn't hold together well, even after cooking for the prescribed time. Maybe next time I'll try cooking it for longer, or putting the pie pan on the floor of the oven.

This was great, next time I might cut the cook time to 4-5 minutes and then chill it, since it was a little hard when I cooked it for 7 minutes.

Delicious crust recipe! Holds together very nicely. I used this to make mini pumpkin cheesecakes and used the optional cinnamon in there. This crust was so delicious. Thanks for posting!

Great crust!  I may have over baked it or the consistency may have changed when the pie was frozen because the crust hardened.  The taste was fantastic and it was so easy to crush the crumbs and mix with the sugar in a plastic bag.

*Update* I made this as the base for coconut cream pie bars. Yum!

This is sooo good.  I just pulse the crackers and sugar in the food processor to get fine crumbs.  I do decrease the sugar to 1/4 c. and find that it's still sweet enough for us.

I made one of Paula Deans cheesecakes, and she said to use a storebought crust, which I'm not too big of a fan of, so I used this and it turned out perfect!! I followed the ingredients to the tee! I used one package of the graham crackers, put them in the food processor along with the sugar and crumbled them up. I then added my butter and processed some more till it was all perfect, then pressed into my 9 in pan and baked for 7 minutes! Great!

Perfect - I use this recipe when I want a sweeter crust than just crumbs and butter. I find melted margarine works well too, though for company or to impress I'll always use butter. Thanks for sharing :)

I use this as the base for White Berry Pie also from this site. The proportions are perfect, and for those of us who don't have access to Graham Crackers it works just as well with digestive biscuits. Thanks Carol

Very simple and easy, plus it modifies well.  I actually used bread crumbs in this recipe (don't shoot me--I was improvising! I'm at my brother and sister in law's house right now) and it worked just as well.  I kept the remaining ingredients the same.  baked a tad longer (about 5 more min) bc I was using fresh bread crumbs, but definitely don't overbake with graham crackers.  Thanks for the recipe!  It worked perfectly as a base for a strawberry rhubarb pie (well, cobbler, with this crust, but we were happy nonetheless).

I followed another reviewer's suggestion of using gallon sized bags to break the crackers in. My toddler's had a lot of fun rolling cans onto the bags to break them down. I then also added the remaining ingredients to the bag then poured into the pie tins. Great recipe!

Simple, yet delicious.  As other reviewers have stated, I cut the sugar.  I use about an eighth of a cup.  The graham crackers are sweet enough alone.

This crust is DELICIOUS!!! The first time I made it, I didn't have enough graham crackers, so I used Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. The next time I made it, I followed the recipe. The third time I made it, I used chocolate graham crackers, and added cocoa powder.

Wow - I never made a graham cracker crust before and this came out perfectly.  Not difficult and tastes so much better than a store bought crust. I used one package of the Honey Made Graham Crackers. Thanks for the great, easy recipe.

Mmm...So yummy and easy! I was craving a key lime pie and didn't have a graham cracker crust.  Looked this recipe up and was so excited to find out how easy it was to make.  Like some of the other reviewers I used a zip lock bag to crush the graham crackers and mix the ingredients.  Easy clean up.  The second time I made it I used a rolling pin to crush the graham crackers(in the bag.  Took about 30 sec. Thanks so much.

Just like it says!  I made this reduced carb by using half graham cracker crumbs and half almond meal, and also replaced Splenda for the sugar.  Turned out very well, tasty and crisp!

It was really crumbly, not too sure what was wrong. The crust wouldn't stay in place and the baking didn't do too much of a difference. Maybe I'd use more butter...Good luck!

This recipe was a hit.  I made this crust for my pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving dessert.  Everyone really liked it, and said it was even better than any traditional pie crust with pumpkin pie.  The only difficulty was that it was hard to cut, but that may be because I used gluten free graham crackers (I have celiac disease).  Overall, very tastey!

I love this recipe!  And I use it often.  It's easy to customize (using different cookies/flavorings) and it is so easy!  I definitely recommend!  Much better to make it yourself than buy a premade one!

Super easy and delicious!  Ready made graham cracker crusts are not available here in Turkey...neither are graham crackers for that matter!  I substituted a digestive cookie (as the reviewer from New Zealand did)and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  My only problem was that the crust was a little bit too crunchy.  Next time I will reduce the sugar and cooking time a little bit to see if it produces a more tender, crumbly crust.  Overall though, it worked well with the 5 star Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake recipe (also from this site.)  This is a keeper!

This turned out perfect.  I made Chocolate Cheesecake II submitted by Diane Young.  I substituted chocolate graham cracker and it really was perfect!  I used my food processor to make the crumbs.  Fast and simple.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe made the perfect crust for cheesecake bars!  They came of the pan easy even though it wasn't a spring-form pan.  I did spray it thoroughly before adding the crust!

This was a very nice graham cracker crust. I did buy my graham crackers already crushed in the box, so preparation was so quick and easy. I put it in my springform pan to be the base for the Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake on this site. Thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome! Rolled over the graham cracks in a bag with my new rolling pin, then mixed it all together and smushed it with a flat glass into my springform pan (I wanted a fancy pumpkin pie :) )
So far, this is great!

I don't blame the recipe, but i didn't like  this crust at all...i ended up scraping it off of the bottom of the cheesecake before I ate it after I tried the crust.
Even though butter tastes better than margerine, it made the crust incredibly rich. (that's a bad thing) If I try this again i'll try margarine and see how it goes...but i'm not sure it'll be worth the trouble.

i used this crust to make no-bake peanut butter pie from this website and so had to freeze it and the crust was close to rock-hard :( i'm not sure what the problem was, it was my first time to make graham cracker crust :P more butter maybe? but it did taste awesome! i will definitely be sticking to this one, thank you :)

This crust didn't set well for me. I followed the recipe exactly except I did add ground pecans to it. I think it was to much filling and not enough butter. Next time i will try to use 1 1/4 cups of graham crackers and about 1/4 cups of butter.
