Followed ingredient list exactly but changed the order in mixing. I also baked on parchment paper.  I used my small cookie scoop which is 1 tablespoon and had a yield of 46 cookies that were 3" in diameter. Thank you for sharing your recipe Cheerios.

really yummy cookie!  However, I used half brown sugar and a splash of vanilla and salt.  I omitted the sunflower seeds as my kids don't like them.  I think adding pecans or walnuts would be good too.

Very good. I normally always mess up cookies but I followed this one exactly except I added vanilla and cinnamon.  They turned out very yummy!  Going to use this one again!

No sunflower seeds on hand so I substituted Sultana raisins, doubled the batch to make enough for a house full for the weekend. It seemed a bit dry in the mix, I added 3 Tablespoons of water and it was a much better consistency, baked on parchment for 8 minutes to light brown and out and started eating.  A go-to recipe for us now.

I quite liked them though mine came out quite soft,  are these supposed to be hard crispy ones or soft ones? How best to store them for 1 week?

I too used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/2 cup of regular sugar.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used walnuts. Pretty good cookie I will make this one again

I followed the recipe except I used half the chocolate chips and put a half a cup peanut butter chips.  My granddaughter loved it.

Very good cookie. I didn't have sunflower seeds so I added coarsely chopped pumpkin seeds instead.. I love a Dolly Madison bar so I subbed half of the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips. Quite tasty!

I had 99% of the ingredients on hand so I thought I would give this a try. Only differences - I added a package of pistachio/brown sugar oats (all I had instead of quick cook oats), sunflower/pistachio/cranberry mix and a dash of cocoa powder to flour mix to make more chocolately looking. Sending to work tomorrow with my hubby because I'm that impressed with this recipe. Making again tomorrow!
