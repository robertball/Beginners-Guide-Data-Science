I roasted the serrano pepper as well.  I also browned a red onion rather than using a raw regular onion.  Good results overall.  If you want to make raita for the purpose of cooling your mouth, this probably isn't the right recipe, as this particular raita definitely packs some heat.  If you just want a delicious compliment to an Indian meal, then this is good pick!

This was delicious!  I made it with rice however, I think I would love to dip fresh pita bread in it also.  I had to leave out that chili pepper or my kids would not even try it but I bet it makes it even tastier. I also added a small clove of crushed garlic because garlic goes so well with eggplant and a tablespoon of lemon because I like a more sour flavor.  Healthy and perfect with chicken or any meat. Thanks!

I had this with basmati rice and while  my mom said it was good, I could only think of the baba ghanoush I could have made instead. Sorry!

I don't know if my review will really be "fair" since I changed it so much, but my husband & I really liked how our raita turned out. I just put lots of garlic and none of the cilantro or serrano or cayenne pepper, and I didn't have enough yogurt, so I subbed some sour cream for the rest of the amount needed. I also added sauteed green pepper to the top of it. I liked the idea of charring the eggplant on my gas burner. It would've worked better for me if I had used medium eggplant; I just had one large, and the charring didn't bake/cook it enough. I had to slice it and bake it for awhile in the oven, but that worked out well. ~Yummy!~

I skipped the serrano peppers, but instead added canned diced tomatoes, some olives and garlic. It was very nice, albeit a little bit too tangy for my taste, hence, 4 stars. Otherwise, it is a really nice and tasty meal; will certainly make it again.

The recipe I follow is very similar to this one, I just add half a bunch of finely chopped cilantro (stems and leaves) and lemon juice to taste.  I also take one small onion fry it golden brown and add 2 tsp cumin seeds and let the smell of the cumin come out.  I dump it all in the raita quick stir and put it in the fridge to let the flavors meld.  This is a very popular dish at my moms house and even my in laws have complimented me on it.  It's so easy and can be made in advance.
