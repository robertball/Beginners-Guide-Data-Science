This was my 1st attempt at baking taro root when I have fried it in the past.  I loved the recipe tip to toss the sliced taro root with olive oil in a bag.  That worked very well and took less time to prepare than brushing with oil.  They turned out somewhat soft after cooking 15 min on one side and 10 min on the other (thinner ones were turning too brown).  Even if they weren't crisp, I still enjoyed them and liked not having to hover over the stove for frying.  I'll definitely make this again and work on the cooking time.  I forgot to take a photo, I ate them too fast!

Well I did this recipe and it was ok. I state it needs to be in the oven a little longer about 20 min each side. I also cut it a little thinner. Another thing is that I say " don't forget to put oil on the bottom of your chips before you put it in the oven or it will stick onto the pan. Other wise it is great and I will be looking for more taro root recipes.
