First off, I HATE pumpkin pie, I hate it so much you'd think I was allergic. I can not recall any holiday where I've subjected myself to consuming this gooey orange colored mass of spices. However, my family LOVES pumpkin pie, and since I play chef every Thanksgiving...I thought I'd give this recipe a trial run before the eating extravaganza comes around this year. I had to taste test of course...what a tasty crunchy explosion of fall flavor! Not only was it simple to put together, but it was terribly yummy. I'm looking forward to unveiling this pumpkin-pie treasure this coming holiday season... I may even pair it with some Jeni's "Maker's Mark/Buttered Pecan" icecream to make for a decadant pie ala mode.

I'm the submitter of this recipe and would like to add a change... I suggest you change the first 1/2 of the cook time to 30 minutes and keep the 2nd 1/2 at 20 minutes to be sure the pumpkin is cooked throughly.  Thanks!

Finally a pumpkin pie without condensed milk and artifical ingredients! This pie makes you wonder why anyone would ever choose a different recipe.  My only caution would be to watch the pecans closely as they can burn before you know it.  Also, after making this recipe several times know, I find that my oven needs another 20 minutes or so.  If you know your oven takes longed I would wait to add the pecans for 30 minutes.  Also good with a walnut and pecan mix on top.

Not only was this pie easy to make, but came out of the oven looking beautiful and tasting fabulous.  I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and everyone loved it.  The crunchy pecan topping on the pumpkin was just delicious!  A nice change from plain pumpkin pie.  The only thing I did was adjust the spices--I doubled them, and also added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping.  I'm going to make this pie again very soon, since there weren't any leftovers for me to bring home.

I made this pie for my husband, who is a very picky eater, and he loved it! It was really simple to make, but it tastes like something that would take a very long time. I definitely recommend it to everyone!

It was indeed very easy!! Cures my boredom with plain ol' pumpkin pie :D. Also, I used a graham cracker crust simply because I hate the doughy kind... worked out well with the other flavors! Thanks.

My sister and I weren't too crazy about this pie. The crust came out sort of soggy, and the pumpkin filling was almost a custard/pudding consistency - which I wasn't expecting. The topping was good, but I didn't like the taste of the pumpkin filling. I wouldn't make it again.

Very easy to make..gotta admit, i am really not a big pumkin pie fan, but everyone else seems to be, so this looked like a pretty good recipe to try. YUMMMYYYY! Definately will make this again....I did have to cook mine about 10 more minutes than the recipe called for though...could be because I made mine in a stone pie plate.

I made this with squash instead of pumpkin.  Cut the squash in half and laid the cut sides down in a pyrex dish, added 1-2 inches water, and microwaved until soft, 8 minutes at a time, then test for softness.  Scoop out and discard seeds, then scoop out flesh and puree in a food processor. I added 17 minutes to the first baking time, because it seemed way too undone to be adding a topping at that point.  For the topping, I used 1 1/2 cups of whole pecans.  Remove the foil from the crust before the last 20 minutes of baking time.

Yummy!! Over the years my family had decided to cut back on its pies for Thanksgiving and one of my favorites to get cut was the pecan. This pie is perfect for the those who love pumpkin pie and pecan pies.Yummy it was like eating pumpkin pie and pecan pie. The only thing I added was some whipped topping and carmal drizzle. This will be the pie I'll be making for now on.  My family and friends loved it and said it was a keeper. Thanks for a recipe that was not only easy to make but looked and tasted sooo delicious.  I used the suggested cooking time and perfect for my oven.  Oh yeah I thought it was just as good if not better than Paula Dean's

Not too sure what I did wrong but this pie did not "set" i ended up scooping it into bowls with ice cream. No one complained but it looked really unappetizing to me; tasted great.

I gave this a test run for the holidays. I have never made a pumpkin pie and the creation process was very new to me. I bought a deep 9-inch pie crust and feared that just the pie filling would over flow. When it was all done I could not be any happier with my first attempt. It was very yummy and it smelled wonderful. I will be making it agian (maybe with a few measurement tweaks)

I used the caramel pecan topping from the recipe.  I used the recipe from Libby's Pumpkin for the rest of the pie.      I don't normally like pumpkin pie but this was absolutely to die for with the pecan topping!     And since I used the other recipe, I did end up baking it quite a bit longer than this recipe called for.

This was the easiest pie I've ever made.  I served it to my in-laws (who are gourmet cooks) and they raved about the result. This recipe is a keeper and bound to be a family classic.

~This pie was very easy to make but i think the cook times are wrong for the pie? It definetly takes more than 40 mins. to bake..Pumpkin pies normally take about an hour. I followed this recipe exactly (& i have a very hot oven & nomally have to 'shorten' my cook/bake times) but it seemed to take forever to bake this one. Had to keep re-setting the timer & checking on it...It took well over an hour to finish it up.

First, let me say, I am NOT a great pie baker - this pie, however, has saved me!  I got rave reviews this weekend!  Comments were so positive - it was not too sweet, the topping added just the right texture and it was a nice twist on the traditional pumpkin pie!  So easy to do - I even made a homemade crust!  Love it!

I made this pie for the first time today for my family's Thanksgiving dinner instead of our traditional pumpkin pie and it was a hit with everyone! My dad, who is a big food snob, even ranked in in his top three pies ever! After tasting this pie I don't know why anyone would ever settle for "just" a pumpkin pie. From now on this will be my family's Thanksgiving pie.
Just a couple of changes I made after reading other people's comments here: I baked the pie for 30 minutes before adding the pecans and then baked it for 30 minutes more instead of the 20/20 recommended in the original recipe. Also, I baked it in a graham cracker crust.

The pie was great. I used less than half of the brown sugar for the topping - and I was glad I did. The cooking time was way off for me though. I was using a frozen pie crust, so it took 45 minutes to get to a consistency that would hold the topping.

This is a great departure from "unadorned" pumpkin pie.  I did bake it for about 15 minutes more than called for in the first stage because the custard wasn't "set".   Also when I put the Pecan mixture on I did so with my hands, this makes it much easier to distribute evenly over the soft pumpkin with out disturbing the soft pumpkin.  I also doubled up on the spices, I did 1 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. Allspice, 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg.  Everyone loved this pie........it's a keeper recipe.

Really Tasty
Everyone thought this was absolutely delicious. But my topping was very crunchy - the caramel part kind of solidified. When I made it I softened the butter and mixed in the brown sugar & nuts then spread on top. Maybe I should have melted the butter? Didn't affect the flavor - just made it harder to cut through the top that was crunchy into the bottom (that part was also delicious0.

Brushed the crust with egg white and baked it for just a few minutes before adding the filling. I cooked it the additional 10 minutes with the pumpkin filling, and then an additional 10 with the pecans. I thought I'd nab a nosh after serving it at an event, but it was all gone! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe because it provides just enough pecan pie without being too rich, and you get the pumpkin with it—a true win! I'll be making this again very soon so I can taste it!

OMG, I'm not a pumpkin pie lover at all.  When  started to look for pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving because my husband and his family like pumpkin pie. I came a pond this recipe ( I for one love pecan pies).  But  I  I was told my bother in-law was bring pie. I was off the hook.  But I still was Intrigue with this recipe.   I today made it for my husband and the kids (gluten free).  Both husband and kids loved it. As for me I LOVE THIS PIE!  I'm going to make it again for Christmas

SOOO yummy!  I was short on brown sugar so I used white sugar and added a little molasses.  I would definitely make it again.  Cooked 40 minutes, added topping then another 20.

I made the filling more like the Libby's recipe (on the back of the pumpkin filling can) but added the topping in this recipe...it was pretty fabulous. Also, prebaking the crust for 15 minutes on 425 eliminated any sogginess of the crust.

Made 2 of these for Thanksgiving.  They were a big hit!  The only little change was the amount of lemon zest. I only used half of what was stated cause I wasn't so sure I'd  like it, but I couldn't tell there was any in it.

Great recipe.

Some tips so it's not mushy or burnt or uncooked underneath!

-Cover the pastry edges with tin foil every time the pastry is cooked in the oven.
-Blind bake the pastry base so that it cooks nicely - 10 minutes will do
-Brush a little egg on the pastry base after blind baking to stop it from going mushy when you add the filling
-Add a little more flour and a little less cream to the pumpkin pie mix (i  also recommend using single or double cream) as otherwise the middle will be pretty mushy
-Cook the initial mix with the pastry for 40 minutes instead of 20 so that it firms up
-After cooling on a wire rack, put in the fridge to keep it fresh and let it set!

Have whipped cream with it, cus ! amazing :)

I hope this helps people who have the pumpkin fever!

I made this with real pumpkin puree and not the canned. My husband loved it. I didn't care for the added lemon. We don't like nutmeg so I used allspice instead. Loved the topping! Custard was not done so I put it back in for an additional 15 minutes. If I make this again I would cook for 30 minutes before adding the topping instead of 20. I would leave out the lemon and double the cinnamon. I can not wait to make this for company for the holidays!

I was so hopeful about this one because of so many positive reviews. But even though I baked this over an hour, it was still kind of mushy and the topping was full of crunchy brown sugar. What did I do wrong? Was I supposed to melt the butter? Because I was very confused, the recipe does not specify softened butter or melted. I used softened. I must have been wrong.

Oh Yum! This elevates 'normal' pumpkin pie to the next level. Great combination of nuts and extra spices. Will save for next time.

This dish was fun to make plus it was cheap and it tasted amazing.The only direction I might change is don't put quite  as much brown sugar,I ended up throwing some of it away,and after you put the caramel-pecan coating on top put it in for a little longer than 20 minutes I put mine in for just about 40 minutes.But other than those two things it was a fabulous dish!

This tasted fantastic but the pie never set completely even after baking it almost an hour. The middle was very mushy.  I will try again but bake the custard at least 40 minutes before adding the topping.

This was excellent!  If you have the time, bake a pumpkin up and use instead of the canned stuff.  What a difference!  Other than that, I did not change anything--except increase the cooking time before adding the pecans.  I love this because I can have two great tastes in one pie!

We tried this for Thanksgiving. To start I love the taste and smell of pumpkin but I DETEST the texture of Pumpkin Pie.  This is by far one of the best pies I have EVER eaten!  Hands down it was the best pie I have baked. My 16 year old son has already asked to bake it two more times.

 A note on the times.  It takes about twice as long to bake then the stated times. I didn't add the topping until about the 40 minute mark.  I did omit the lemon zest only because I forgot to purchase a lemon when I was out and about.
