So far I've made this recipe 5 times and every time people go bonkers for it. Something about the sugary sweetness combined with the moist cake makes people act like its laced with street drugs. People can't get enough of it! I've even been asked if I bought them. the only changes I make are to reduce the icing sugar in the icing to 2 cups. It's still plenty sweet but it retains more of the marshmallowy goodness and prevents my guests from slipping into a diabetic coma. I also like to use a melon baller to core out the middle of my cupcakes, fill it with the recipe icing and then top it with my favourite buttercream icing. Oh yeah. It's just that awesome. It's a terrible injustice for me to be gluten intolerant but I do gain some satisfaction while watching my family slide across the kitchen floor on my drool after seeing them scarf it all down like a flock of seagulls fighting over a french fry.

My adult daughter requested a Twinkie Cake for her birthday. I found this recipe and made it.  Being a chocolate lover,  I never thought a yellow cake with white icing could be so good, but it was delicious.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make it again.

Best cake I've ever produced. Very light and silky. Loved the frosting. I didn't change anything other than had no electric mixer.
