WOW! This is a fantastic recipe. My family loved it. The crumbcake is moist and packed with chocolate chips. I double the topping and that really makes a big difference. Try it, it is FANTASTIC!

I served this to company about an hour after it came out of the oven and it was slightly warm...it tasted a little heavy.  But the next day, it was perfect.  So I definately recommend letting it cool for several hours before serving.  I think I would also use less choc. chips in the cake part next time.  I will try more topping as someone suggested too.  A good casual cake, I will make again.

The ingredients of this recipe differ from the order in the directions. The ingredients have the chips in the topping and the directions have it going in the cake. DO IT IN THE TOPPING!!! Much better.

I think I would use less chocolate chips next time, even though I like chocolate chips.  All in all, a really easy, nice snacking cake.  Great for after school, etc.

I found this to be very dry and heavy.  No one in my family liked it.  After is sat for a few days I finally threw it out.

The cake itself was quite good with a fine number of chips, but I had the devil of a time making the stressel topping.  Also - a suggestion as to handle the streusesel without nuts would have been helpful.

This cake was very good and moist, but, i agree with other reviewers.....too many chocolate chips!
I made it a second time with the chocolate only in the topping and thought it was much better.

This recipe was okay.  I used walnuts in the topping and I think I would leave them out next time.
