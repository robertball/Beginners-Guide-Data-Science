Yummy!  Love it!

I did make a few changes, however ... I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil; I used All-Bran instead of the wheat germ and flax seed meal; and I used Splenda Brown Sugar mixture instead of regular brown sugar ... oh, and I didn't have any honey, so I used sugar-free maple syrup.

It is really great, and this way it is lower-fat/lower calories, but I will probably only use about 1/3 of the recommended salt next time.

And, unlike many of the granola recipes out there, it DOES make the "clumps" that make it yummy to eat just out of the bag OR w/ milk/soy milk.

Enjoy!

Very easy.  I didn't use sunflower seeds, i just put more nuts.  Just keep an eye on it.  My first batch was toasted before the hour was up.  It's also very versatile:  I made one once batch with walnuts, and after baking stirred in pieces of dried apples and raisins, and anther batch with almonds and pecans and almond extract instead of vanilla, then stirred in dried cranberries after baking.  In the future, i plan on just making a double batch and keeping toasted nuts and dried fruits on hand to make up a different flavor every morning!

Wonderful, versatile recipe!  I omitted the brown sugar and used 1/3 cup real maple syrup instead of honey; decreased the oil to 1/4 cup; and I used slivered instead of sliced almonds for more texture.  Oh, I might have tossed some oat bran in there too.  Didn't miss the sugar at all, and I like things sweet.  Mine only took maybe 40-45 minutes to bake.  When cool, I added some dried blueberries - Delicious, chunky, perfectly flavored granola!!

This granola is so good that I can't stop eating it!!  I used All-Bran cereal instead of the wheat germ and flax meal, Splenda baking mix instead of the brown sugar, and sugar-free maple syrup for the honey.  I used a combination of almond/vanilla extract and a combo of walnuts and peanuts.  SO GOOD!!!

Awesome recipe.  This was the first granola I ever made and it turned out great.  The only thing was the day after I made it, it got chewy, so I put it in the oven again for 20 min and it crisped right back up.

I love this recipe.  I do recommend checking after 35 minutes. The first time I made it an hour was too long and it got really brown, although we still ate it and it was good.  Second time I only baked it about 40 minutes any longer it would have been too dark.  I did add dried cranberries after it cooled.   Also, I used part melted Smart Balance butter spread and oil.  It's better than any store bought granola.

Perfect recipe. One idea that works well for me too - heat the oil and honey (and maybe some maple syrup too...just a little) in the microwave and add it to the mixture. it keeps the granola soft and nice in texture

Love this!!!! I have made at least 4 batches in the last couple months and it is soooo YUMMY! I'm sure you could add/ sub different nuts and ingredients easily. A small bowl also fills me up and keeps me full for a long long period of time so I am not snacking on unhealthy foods throughout the day = )

Too much salt, not much other flavoring.  After I baked it, I mixed more honey, vanilla and cinnamon and remixed and baked.

LOVE THIS.  I'm eating it right now with milk and I'm totally enjoying every bite.  The best granola I've had.  I only had almonds so I did a cup of those and a 1/2 cup of coconut. Also way more cinnamon and salt and some maple syrup.  Going to add some dried fruit to it as well.  GREAT recipe and it doesn't hurt your jaw to chew!

I cute this recipe in half because I don't use that much granola. Also substituted a LOT of things. I used 1 cup of oats, and then 1/2 cup of rolled quinoa, 1/2 kiwicha, and instead of the flax seed, I used lin seed, instead of sunflower seeds I used sesame flour (which is more like a masa than a flour), instead of almonds I used peanuts, instead of brown sugar I used organic sugar plus a bit of sugar cane syrup. I made more of the honey/water liquid than what this calls for to add to the sweetness and to make this clump up better. 

I think the baking works best if you spread the mix on a baking sheet very thinly (packed tightly) and bake it for 20 minutes, but be sure to watch it and make sure it's not burning. It will clump better if you pack it in a thin layer. Otherwise it doesn't stick together. 
The ratio of dry ingredients to wet is perfect. I love the recipe.

Salty and sweet, not to mention addictive!  I added raisins for some extra sweetness.  This will be a great addition to yogurt, mixed with fruit, or just for snacking.

First time making this recipe (or any homemade granola), but I will definitely be making it again.  I made a couple of substitutions:  coconut oil for the canola oil, and agave nectar for the brown sugar (reduce quantity of agave nectar to 1/4 cup and also reduce water to 1/4 cup).  I also added 1/3 cup coconut flakes.

This stuff is great as long as you bake it long enough.  I had to stir it every few minutes so maybe that's why it took longer to bake - but my advise is - don't take it out until it is more than golden brown.  We love this stuff.

Very good. I replaced a small portion of the oats with some triticale, rye meal, and millet but kept the ratios the same.

Deliceous!  The only thing I omitted was the wheat germ since I didn't have any.  I think next time I will try leaving it in for 5 minutes longer to see if I can't get it a little crunchier although it is addicting just as is.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I am already excited to make this and give it away for Christmas presants.

This stuff is delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe. Since I didn't want it to burn (like I'd read in other posts), I only baked it a total of 45 minutes or so. I still like the consistency of it, but it's not as crunchy. I might try either baking it longer or spreading it out on two different cookie sheets so the layers are thinner (in just one pan, even a 9X13, it's still piled pretty deep). Love the variability too -- I added some chopped dates to give it that flavor, and really any dried fruit would go well in here! Thank you!

It turned out great! I did change things up though. I added coconut, left out the seeds, and replaced the honey with agave syrup. Great on yogurt with fruit!

I can't compare this to any other home made granolas but it is far tastier than anything I've bought from the store. I didn't have the sunflower seeds or flax seed meal but will definitely add those when I make it again (which will be soon and often).

This is a great recipe!!  We love this as a cereal with some dried fruit mixed in, but our favorite way to eat this is with some yogurt & fresh fruit - the perfect parfait!  The only thing I would do differently is to mix the salt in with the liquid ingredients before pouring over the oats, which I didn't do the first time and it resulted in some very salty bites and some bites with no salt.  The 2nd time I made it, I made that change and it was the perfect salty sweet balance that mixed together nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe, I will be making this one over and over, my family (and me too) can't stop eating it!

Great recipe but too heavy on the salt. I only used 1 tsp but it was still too salty. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 T but I could have used even more. I added Craisins. Yum

My son and I really enjoy this granola alone, with milk and topping our yogurt.  I did add flax seed for some more fiber intake.  Next time I will spread out on more cookie sheets and reduce cooking time.  Some of the granola was not as crunchy as I like it and then other pieces were burnt.

This is the best Granola recipe I have ever had. You may have to cook it for an extra 15 minutes, depending on the size of the cookie sheet you use.

This granola is wonderful, and super easy to make! I double the recipe and keep it in the pantry for up to a month. A very easy recipe to tweak based on your preferences. I double the honey and put in whole almonds and dried cranberries. Delicious!

Very yummy!!! All I did was sub 1 1/2 cups All bran for the wheat germ and flax seed, as suggested by other reviewers.
I may try to sub applesauce for the oil and cut some of the sugar next time around, just to make it a bit healthier. But it is really good as is! Can't stop munching on it!

This is eaten almost every day at my house! I put it over oatmeal in place of sugar. I've used chopped walnuts in place of the almonds and love that too.

My only complaint: a little too much salt.  Out of all of the granola recipes I have tried, however, I like this one the best, and will definitely make it again.

I added 6 fresh chopped dates to the dry ingredients. Also instead of wheat germ, I added 1/2 cup of raw pumpkin seeds, 1/4 cup chia seeds and 1/4 cup buckwheat groats. Instead of 1/2 cup water I added 1/2 cup Organic Blue Agave and 1/4 cup of water. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tbls. Oh, also add 1/2 cup of coconut.  YUM!

This was my first time making granola and it turned out pretty good. I cut down on the salt a little just because I used salted sunflower seeds, and I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ because it was what I had on hand. The flavor was good, but next time I will probably make more of the liquid mixture to try to get it to clump better. It was very crumbly, but maybe homemade granola is supposed to be that way. I have nothing to compare it to, so I'm just going to play around until it gets to a texture that I prefer.

I'm giving five stars for the recipe as written. I followed it almost exactly (didn't have the sunflower seeds so I added cashews instead) and it is delicious AND super easy. This is also a wonderful base recipe. Next time I'm adding coconut. I might substitute half the oil for applesauce.

Love this recipe. I add more or less of just about everything depending on what is on hand at the time. I share it as gifts with rave reviews and pass the recipe on when I can.

Easy and makes alot! Only thing I would add is more large chunks of items like walnuts and dried fruit. I found there were too many little things that sifted through. I like my granola a bit more chunky as a topping to my yogurt or bran flake cereals. Have made it three times, though. love it!

Overall good recipe.  I love the texture - the granola clumps just enough without turning into a solid mass.  The combination of grains and nuts also gives a great texture.  However, I agree with other users who say that there's WAY too much salt and not enough other flavors.  I love salty snacks, but wasn't a big fan of the salty granola - it overpowered other tastes.  If you are used to eating a lot of nutty grains the flavor is perfect if you cut back on salt.  I added about 1/2 cup of raisins to give it some natural sweetness.  I'll add more dried fruit next time for more sweet taste, especially since I'm making it to share with my young kids who will eat a lot of whole grains only if I mask them with enough other flavors.  Definitely a more "grown up" taste with the original recipe.

super easy to tweek for what is in your kitchen. I have made this now four times in two weeks. I love having it on-hand and to put in jars to give for gifts. I omitted the flax seed and wheat germ this last time. I used pumpkin seeds, raw whole almonds and walnuts for nuts. The last 20 minutes I put in some crasins and raisins. And used Agave for honey and olive oil (light) instead of canola. And no cinnamon because I don't care for it that much. The granola still turned out great the forth time and I know I will keep changing it up as well as go back to the real recipe. This is great!

Very easy to make, & fun too! I couldn't find any sliced almonds/pecans, so I just smashed them with a nifty tool :) The only thing I dislike about the granola is that the honey and cinnamon flavors can hardly be detected in it. Next time I make this, I'll add a teaspoon more of cinnamon and maybe 1/4 cup more of honey c:

I thought this was not good at all. I had never made granola before, so I wasn't really sure what to do. But the cook time was WAY TOO long,the water diluted it way too much. I remade with the following Changes: I highly recommend toasting the wheat germ, I only used almonds, no salt as it is not needed, no vanilla, I used 2 TLBS dark brown sugar, half the oats, apple sauce in place of oil, 100% maple syrup 1/3 cup (not pancake stuff) mixed with apple sauce and a touch of honey. NO WATER!!! And OMG was this awesome. Oh and I addded some dried fruit.

This is really good.  I left out the brown sugar and sunflower seeds because I didn't have any.  I used maple syrup instead of honey and put in a little extra since I didn't have the brown sugar.  I also used applesauce instead of oil.  Delicious, thanks for sharing such a great, versatile recipe!

Wonderful recipe! The original recipe is perfect, but I made some changes to fit our lifestyle.  Including trying to reduce the amount of sweet in our diet. I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup , used pumpkin instead of sunflower seeds, used chia seeds instead of flax and used a full cup of almonds because my kids don't like pecans.  I have made it with honey, maple syrup and also a cherry syrup (natural) and it always turns out fabulous!!  You can dehydrate it (140 degrees), if you are into RAW food.  It takes about 4 hours, but is still wonderful.  Thanks so much!

The texture is fabulous. This stuff actually clumps, unlike a lot of other granola recipes, but it lacks flavor. I added some dried cranberries, but next time I will add more cinnamon and vanilla.

I hesitate to write a review because I changed the recipe to make it less fat/refined sugar free. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil, and I used honey instead of brown sugar. I recommend making it the way its written, however, I would double the cinnamon.

This recipe is awesome!  Way to go Jennifer whoever you are.  The only change I made is to omit the pecans (my husband is allergic) and to sub craisins. My husband is already asking me when I'll make it again!

I eat this granola recipe almost every morning as a bowl of cereal.  I feel good knowing that at least I've started out my day eating a healthy meal.  I make it as is or throw in whatever I happen to have on hand.  I love to add dried blueberries!

Fabulous base recipe I used my own mixture of nuts along with the oats, and ours is delicious with milk or yogurt. Just make sure you have the overall quantity of dry ingredients correct =) Don't skip the pecans! (If you like a strong cinnamon flavor, definitely add more)

The only thing i did differently was I used coconut oil in place of the canola oil. I am not sure if that really changed the outcome. I just thought it wasn't sticking together like granola I would get at the store. I thought the taste was okay. Next time I might add more cinnamon and vanilla. Thank you for the recipe though. :)

After trying a few recipes, this is my family's favorite. It's versatile, like most granolas. I tend to stick to the recipe, but add a tsp. almond extract with the vanilla and sometimes some chia seed meal. After it's cooked I add dried fruit -- blueberries, cherries, raisins, cranberries, whatever. This stuff is YUM!

Best granola ever! Made many batches already.  Used different nuts and seeds each time.  Tried using maple syrup and turned out great!  Pressed the mixture in the baking pan made granola chunks.

This recipe is great and it is easy to change a few things. My changes: I use 6 cups of oats instead of 4 (makes a bigger batch and more lowfat). I also usually use walnuts instead of almonds and I add about 1/2 cup almond meal. I also mix together the canola oil, water, cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla and cook it on the stove until it comes to a boil. Makes the granola less gritty with the brown sugar and cinnamon dissolved. I also add a teaspoon of almond extract to the above mixture and it is delicious and I use just a squeeze of honey or even skip it. I like to add dried cranberries, raisins, and dried cherries when the granola is toasted and cooled. Excellent and a lot healthier than the granola you buy at the store...and a lot cheaper!!!

I would make this again. I made it for the first time as written. Texture wise it came out great. Next time I will do as others suggest and reduce the salt, probably to 3/4 t. I will either add more honey or sub maple syrup as other reviewers suggested. I suggest you taste the wet mixture to see if it is sweet enough for your taste before you combine with the dry mixture.

This granola recipe is almost perfect for me, because it isn't too sweet and sticky. The only things I tweaked were to make the 1/2 C of flax seeds to also include sesame seeds, both regular and black. Then I switched out the pecans for salted peanuts and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also added 1/2 C coconut. After the baking, when it had cooled a little, I added diced, dried mango and Craisins. Super yummy! I will look no further.

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of adding craisins in the end.  My family and I love it just the way it is.  it's very easy to make and very tasty.  Of all the granola recipes I've tried over the years, by far this is the best!

4.5 stars.  Big hit in the house, for kids and adults.  I did not have all of the ingredients, so used oats and nuts but no flax seed or wheat germ.  Also I used applesauce because we were out of oil.  Having said that, the flavor was great.  I did have to keep breaking up the pieces while it was cooking, but some of them just didn't get small enough, and those pieces are more chewy.  I like my granola to have a good crunch and the smaller pieces definitely have it.  Perhaps if I had used the oil instead of applesauce, the problem would be solved?  We'll know next time!

I haven't made granola for many years but recently have been eating more nuts & seeds so thought I'd try making some. The proportions of things is great.Because I'm a mild diabetic I used mostly sugar free syrup with just a tablespoon or two of real maple syrup. I also left out the brown sugar & cinnamon and no salt. I was concerned that with little real sugar in it that it wouldn't caramelize but it's wonderful. Top with some Greek Yogurt and you have a great start to any day.

Loved it! Wasn't too sweet, but the kids still really enjoyed it!! I ran out of flax seed, so I added chia seeds instead. I left them whole and it worked great.

The best granola recipe I have found. I've made it several times, keeping in mind that you can add just about anything as long as the dry and wet amounts don't change.

This granola is great.  I like to substitute applesauce for the oilmand walnuts for the sunflower seed. I leave out the flaxseed meal since I am not able to eat it and I just add more of the nuts to make up for it.

Great recipe, I didn't have all of the ingredients (no flax meal or sunflower seeds) so I added more of the nuts. I also added flaked coconut and cranberries.  I tried this as a cereal and after combining with rice milk I found it a little too sweet but still very tasty. Made a second batch and cut the sugar and honey in half which was a bit too much.  Next time I will try cutting both but just a little less and then I think it will be perfect for using as a cereal.  Overall I think this is a fantastic and very versatile recipe.

Somebody please come get this out of my house before I eat it all?  :) Oh this is delicious. I made it to give as some homemade Christimas goodies to people but I am the one eating it! The only change I made in the recipe was to omit the brown sugar and most of the honey and use agave syrup. I baked for the full hour and stirred every 20 minutes. One pan got a little toasty around the edges so I'd say you can bake this 45 minutes easily without problems, but the last 10-15 minutes is when things really change. Watch it carefully. I mixed both pans together, so the extra "toastiness" was distributed and not a problem. At first it didn't clump up, but as it cools it does. This is full of healthy stuff, but still is pretty hi cal (especially the way I've been eating it) I'll definutely make this again.. great for gift giving. Something good for you, that tastes great!

Most delicious!   I made a batch of it and before I knew it, it was all gone because everyone else thought it was just as good as I did.  ...and it makes the house smell wonderful.  So now for round 2, where I'll make 2 batches and hope it lasts a little longer... though that's not very likely :)

Making this right now, buddy!!  Smells so good! Used 8 pkts of original organic oatmeal, which contains salt and sugar already.  Omitted flax, sunflower seeds and pecans (didn't have 'em, so ain't gonna shop for 'em), replaced oil with apple sauce and added a touch more vanilla extract.  Forgot to combine wet ingredients separately (I cook and read as I go, bad bad.) so sprinkled the half cup water over combined ingredients.  Added half a tsp of cinnamon more.  Will let you know how this goes... Last fifteen minute increment and flip.  Turned oven off to let mix crisp up.  1 hour to munching time!

This is the best granola recipe I've ever tried.  We love this.  I've been making it for many weeks now.  At first I thought it sounded like a lot of salt, but I think the amount written is perfect.  When I take it out of the oven, I add lots of raisins.  We have tried it with other fruit, but we like raisins best. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've already made this recipe twice - loving it. I only had quick oats on hand and it's fine. No sunflower seeds on hand so just added more of the other nuts. One tsp of salt was plenty. Used a pyrex glass casserole dish and it was fine after baking for an hour (some other reviewers commented that an hour was too long). Not super crunchy but just enough "chew". I plan on making it for my dad for his birthday.

It seems that most reviews that appear at this site are really ADAPTATIONS of recipes.  I find very few reviews that reflect the recipes exactly as they are presented, so let me state that I made this granola with no adaptations or substitutions.  Having said that, I think this granola tastes good, but it is soggy, and what disappointed me most is the fact that the granola doesn't hold together in clumps.  It is very loose and is best eaten with a spoon.  The taste is good, but I wish it were more like the store-bought granola that is so readily available.

Very good granola! One suggestion- put it in two 9x13 pans to bake it because one pan doesn't allow much room for stirring, and it browns more evenly when it's in a thinner layer.

Yum!  This granola rocks!  I took the suggestion of another user and substituted the canola oil for unsweetened apple sauce because I had it on hand and it was one less item that I needed to purchase from the grocery store.  It's fabulous.  I'll probably be having this for breakfast every morning for a long time to come!

yum! there's a subtle sweetness to this granola. i didn't have any sunflower seeds so i made do with 3/4 cup each of the almonds & pecans. come to think of it, sunflowers seeds are a different texture and taste than the nuts so you might be better off not even using them or substituting some other kind of nut.

I have been using this recipe to top my yogurt and berries and now am addicted to it. I made slight changes, used coconut oil, substituted walnuts for almonds and added a dab more honey and vanilla. For me its much better than store bought and healthier.

Loved this recipe. I swapped oil for coconut oil, I added 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and full flax seed as opposed to ground. Will definitely make again

This is almost the same recipe as my grandmas! I added coconut flakes and doubled the oats as her recipe states. added extra cinnamon. I will probably add more liquids next time tho because I do like the clusters more. It smells soooo good. Also making homemade yogurts just so I could eat the granola with it! Thank you for reminding me of my grandmas recipe!!

I really like this recipe, although I made a few changes for my own tastes. I doubled the almonds, used hazelnuts instead of pecans, and sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds (for some reason the raw sunflower seeds at my store are always out). I also use buckwheat flour in place of wheat germ. I mix the brown sugar with the wet ingredients, because it seems to clump too much for my liking when it is mixed with the dry ingredients. I also use a mix of honey and real maple syrup.

The listed cook time is WAY too long. I only baked this for half of the recommended time, but this turned out charred  with an acrid burnt taste that my family fortunately could tolerate. Won't make again.

There were several ingredients I didn't have - sunflower seeds, pecans, vanilla extract, or flax seed meal (although I did use flax seed) - and it is still delicious and easy.

I will make it again. I am diabetic and replaced the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar substitute and the honey with amber blue agave syrup. Also added pine nuts, just because I like them. When I gathered my ingredients, I found I was short on the wheat germ, fortunately I had some Wheetabix to make up the difference by crushing the biscuits. My oven may run a little hotter than most so next time I'll cook for 45 minutes. It makes for a very tasty crunchy cereal. My wife likes to eat it raw.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I've made this recipe several times with slight variations.  More nuts, less brown sugar, added an egg to the mix one time, and every time the granola was delicious.  Adding this to oatmeal in the morning gives a wonderful added flavor and a delightful crunch oatmeal needs, in my opinion.  Super easy and healthy.  Enjoy granola? You'll love this one.

I make this all the time. I use old fashioned oats instead of quick. I use the same proportions of seeds and nuts but mix and match accordingly. 45 min in a 300 oF oven is good. Still, keep an eye on it for burning. After the baking I add Craisins and dried mango. YUM!

Made as directed but added 1 cup dried apricots and 1 cup raisins after baked and cooled. Shouldn't have baked it an hour, got a little too dark. Next time will bake less. Though we still really liked it. Makes a lot! Can't wait to try with yogurt.

Made some changes to suit my tastebuds:
Omitted brown sugar and vanilla and water. 
Substituted canola with coconut oil and oats with extra thick whole grain rolled oats (by: Red Mill)
Added dried cranberries, raw coconut, raw cashews, pumpkin seeds and hemp husk.  I always try to use organic and unsweetened so I have control over sweetness. 
Made a triple batch, shared and put extra in mason jars for later! So much better than store bought!

Just made this granola and it is pretty darn tasty! I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and omitted the salt.  After it cooled I tossed in a cup of dried cranberries and a cup of peanut butter chips.  The hour to cook was fine. I will definitely make this again and probably do a double batch.

*UPDATE*
I made a couple of tweaks: Increased the honey to 1/2 a cup and tossed it every 15 min. since it was a little burnt on the first batch. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Perfect recipe.  I added some coconut, my sunflower seeds were already salted so I used no salt.  I agree with the time, I only cooked mine about 35-40 minutes.

A scoop of this with vanilla yogurt and some fresh fruit is my favorite way to start the day.  The only changes I make are substituting walnuts for the sunflower seeds, as others have suggested, and adding 1/2 cup of oat bran for some added fiber.

Great tasting easy granola! I too substituted bran for the wheat germ and flax and I mixed ALL my wet ingredients together before adding to the oats/nuts. I think it was evenly coated this way. I baked it for the full hour, and stirred it every twenty minutes and it came out nicely toasted. It doesn't really clump but I put it in yogurt with some berries and it's yummy!

Great granola recipe. My only changes: I don't use the nuts/seeds listed. I add 1 cup nuts (walnuts usually). After cooked, stir in about 1 cup dried fruit of choice. Perfect. Made an apple cinnamon granola (added chopped dried apples and extra cinnamon after cooking) and my husband loved it.

Really liked it. Tried to make it just as the recipe says, except I used virgin coconut oil in place of the canola oil. Less cooking time next time, but really good.

Great recipe for getting your protein.  I don't add the brown sugar and use 1/2 cup honey total, use wheat bran instead of germ and no-sugar-added orange juice instead of water.

This is a delicious and versatile granola.  The base of honey and brown sugar gives it a rich flavor.  Any nuts and seeds you like can be substituted for those in the recipe, and it's great with dried fruit mixed in.  The cook time was perfect for my oven.

Omitted brown sugar; this is unbelievable. I couldn't even wait for it to cool!  Great ideas on mixing in dried fruits to mix it up.  I will be having this EVERY morning!

Good, but, just a little sweeter than what I was looking for. Have been using it occasionally to top off yogurt.

Good! I thought it was just a little off, but my parents loved it to death.

This was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Very healthy though.
