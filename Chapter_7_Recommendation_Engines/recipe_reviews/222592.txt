This is the first corned beef and cabbage recipe I have ever made. It was so good that I have no need to ever try another. Besides the fact that it was very easy to make, it tastes amazing! My boyfriend says it is his new favorite dish. The only thing I would recommend is to trim the majority of fat off of the brisket because it tends to either stay on the meat, or melt off into your vegetables.

Served this last night to husband and guests. Delicious! This will be my go-to recipe for corned beef! The only thing I will change is to steam the cabbage separately to retain the pretty green color, as putting it in the crock-pot made it an ugly brown (Tasty though!) Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I have been getting recipes from this website for several years now. This the my first time that I'm rating a recipe.  This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I used white potatoes (about 6) and about three handfuls of baby carrots.  I cut my meat in half so it would better fit my crockpot and cut some of the fat off.  I waited a couple of hours before I added half a large head of cabbage. The flavor was excellent.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This was one of the best recipes I've ever tried for corned beef.  I liked the little hint of sweetness.  I added brown sugar instead of white. I think 1-2 cups of water would be sufficient. I did not add the cabbage.  I roasted that separately with onions in the oven, just because I like that better. I'm quite sure this will be my "go-to" recipe from now on for St. Patrick's Day!

I made this recipe, as is, and it was delicious. Definitely agree that maybe more potatoes and carrots.

I made this, but with a slight alteration.  I added two cups of water and 1 cup of dark ale beer. I substituted brown sugar for white sugar. I also put the brisket on top of the potatoes, carrots and onion and "then" poured the whisked liquid slowly over the brisket.  I placed the cabbage wedges around the beef (careful not to submerge them)and overlapped where necessary and sprinkled the wedges with seasoned salt.  I set the timer for 10 hours, and on the 9th hour, I slowly submerged the cabbage wedges into the liquid around the brisket.  Everyone raved about it and asked for more!  Definitely a keeper!

While I am not a corned beef connoisseur, I was asked to cook this for Saint Patrick's Day for my girlfriend. What I can say, is that this is the best corned beef dinner I have tasted, and she LOVED it!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I am looking forward to the grilled Ruben Sandwiches tomorrow!!  But do as most people stated and only steam the cabbage for the last hour.

Ok I need to say that I've never been a fan of corned beef, I use a smoked shoulder for my boiled dinner (no hate comments please). But my honey is always looking for corned beef on St Patrick's day. So this year I decided I'd still make my traditional dinner, AND cook a corned beef in my crock pot. I looked at many of the slow cooker recipes and decided on this one given the ease and the great reviews. I followed the recipe to a T, other than I left out the potato and cabbage (because I was cooking those with my shoulder), I did add the other veggies for flavor, and I used a flat cut of corned beef. I let it cook overnight on low (it prob cooked about 11 hours). This is definitely the way to cook corned beef, it came out very tender and tasty! This recipe was VERY easy to put together, all the ingredients were things I had on hand. Even if you are not a fan of corned beef (as I'm not) but you want to give it a try, I highly recommend this recipe! Thank you Trisheee!! You have (almost) made me a fan of corned beef, and that's not an easy task.

So easy to make. Used baby carrots and red potatoes. I was not sure it was going to have enough flavor. I was tempted to add broth instead of water but went by the recipe.It was very flavorful and so easy to make! It was nice to put it all in the crockpot and have dinner all ready later.

I must admit, I wasn't too sure how this dish would come out since it was not only my first time making, but also the fact that I asked other more feequent corned beef cabbage makers and they never used a crock pot. I took the chance, combined everything in crock pot just as the recipe called for and went to bed. I work night shift  so this was super convenient. The best was waking up to the awesome smells of this dish. I added the cabbage for the last hour of cooking.  I must say, I couldn't get enough! I returned for seconds and had to stop myself after the third! I recommend this dish and am so grateful to you Trisheee! Especially since it is so easy to put together. This recipie is a keeper. Thanks Again For Sharing!

This is a great recipe! This is the only recipe I can get my son and husband to eat! I substituted the seasoning packet for 1 teaspoon allspice, 1 teaspoon ground mustard, & 1 teaspoon dill weed. Added everything else like the recipe & 1 knorr stock beef! Great recipe! Thank you!

This will be the third year I've used this recipe for St. Patrick's Day.  So easy and comes out so delicious.  Like most other reviewers, I too add more carrots & potatoes. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was the first time I used a flat cut corned beef (rather than point cut), and it was MUCH less fatty, and worth the difference in price. I started the crockpot on High, and forgot to turn it down, but it turned out fine. Put the potatoes and carrots in the pot after about 3 hours - they cooked for 3 hours - and that was perfect. I put the cabbage wedges on top for the last hour. It turned out great!

This recipe was great!  My corned beef came with no spice packet so I looked up what was in the packet. I used cloves, ginger,  brown sugar instead of white sugar,  and a cinnamon stick along with the rest of the ingredients in the recipe. My family all raved about how good it was.

I will never try another recipe. My husband is not a lover of this meal and he said "this is the best corned beef you've ever made!"   I cooked in crock pot on high for 2 hours the 4-5 hrs on low. Put spices, corned beef with garlic and onion from the start. Added cabbage, carrots and potato when turned to low. Yummy!

This was a huge hit with my husband and my toddler son, both of whom gobbled it right up and practically drank the sauce out of their dishes. Personally, I found it a bit too salty, but I can't fault the recipe for that since the recipe doesn't even call for salt. I guess my particular cut of corned beef was really salty, or there was a lot of salt in the included spice packet. Next time I think I'll try the suggestion of adding more cabbage and other veggies to help to soak up more of the salty broth. There will be a next time, though, since this was such a hit with the boys.

I guess I haven't had corned beef very often, but I admit I was disappointed that my corned beef wasn't a bit more tender than it turned out. I tried a flat cut and a point cut thinking I would learn which I liked best. Neither was very tender after 8+ hours of cooking. I also learned that the green cabbage looks far better with the corned beef than the red that I tried. (It will dye your potatoes and carrots purple)  So make sure you buy the green cabbage. The flavor was pretty good, it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.

The meat came out great but I was disappointed with the vegetables. I followed the recipe except I left out the potatoes and added more onion. The vegetables were really bland. I can't figure out where I went wrong. I did one hour on high and 6 hours on low. Next time I will put the meat on the bottom and add more seasoning.

Dynamite recipe!!! I used a 1 can of Bud Light and the rest with water.  I also used a 4 pound Eye of Round Corned Beef Brisket which isn't that easy to find, but it has less fat, shrinks less, and is wonderful!  It also doesn't fall apart.  My guests couldn't stop raving about it.  
Normally this is a meal I reserve for St. Patty's Day, but I'll be having this several times throughout the year, thanks to this stress-free wonderful recipe!

This is super delicious and easy! I did mine in the crockpot. I don't recommend cooking the vegetables like this - I think they taste terrible like this but maybe that's just my personal prefence. The meat is crazy good though! I was lazy and just did the sugar, vinegar, water, garlic, and seasoning packet and it's delish. It seems pretty hard to screw up. Fair warning - this recipe will make your entire house smell... interesting.

I tried this recipe yesterday (got a slow start). Put it all in the fridge and heated it up today. DELICIOUS! I waited for my hubby to say something & finally I said "Well???"  He looked at me and said "Perfect".  I thought so too. Thanks for sharing this with us Trisheee. Its great. Only change I made was to use two Splenda packets instead of sugar, since hubby is diabetic. Will definitely use this from now on, as written. Yummm! Spoodledike.

This was the best corned beef and cabbage that I have ever made.  It was super easy to make.  Some people said that it was too salty but i found that before you put it in your slow cooker you need to rinse off the brine that it comes packaged in.  Yummy.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

The whole family loved this!  I used more potatoes and we love garlic so I used 8 cloves.  I used vegetable broth instead of water and added half a pint of Guinness.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and only added the cabbage in the last hour -- it still had some green and some crunch to it.  Delicious!  And the meat just fell apart with a fork.

Sooooo good! Made it for St. Patrick's Day and it was so easy and so delicious. I think I was a little heavy handed with the salt and pepper. We had mixed reviews on whether it still needed more or not. I personally thought it was perfect but as I said, I added a little more than the recipe called for but that's merely a preference thing and easily customizable after serving. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and so easy! I used redskins cut in half and baby carrots. The only thing is I have a 6 quart crockpot and it was filled to the top, so I only put half the cabbage in (for flavor) and steamed the other half right before it was finished. This will be my staple for St. Party's Day from now on!!

I love this recipe!  I’ve made this at least four or five times and get rave reviews from everyone who eats it. I don’t make any adjustments, but follow the recipe as written. The apple cider really adds flavor and tenderizes the corned beef.

I made the corned beef pet the recipe but chose to die the potatoes and cabbage separate .  As an Irish family I have made tons of corned beef and cabbage dinners!!!  I got huge praises around the table .... I have to admit I was afraid of the sugar in the recipe.  My Daughter tastes the difference right away and loved it!!!  I got the message loud and clear this is the recipe that I will be making going forward !  Thank you got the recipe!

I hadn't  cooked corned beef in years and was intrigued by the  unique addition of sugar, vinegar and bay leaf in this recipe. This  is very tasty.  Made as written but used small unpeeled red potatoes and added half of a head of cabbage cut in chunks the last two hours.  Rinsing the meat before adding to the crockpot helps decrease the saltiness.  No more  stove top corned beef for me!

Aside from preparing the cabbage separately  (I have another recipe for it) I made this as written. I wont be on the hunt for another corned beef recipe because this is DELICIOUS!!!! Due to the long cook time, I made sure to keep the chunks of potatos and carrots quite large to prevent them from getting mushy. This one is a winner!!!

Easy and simple. I made a soup with the leftovers. Just be sure to try and scrape off the seasoning packet ingredients if you try the soup. Something in there was not good.

Wonderful and so tender!  Made it on St. Patty's Day for my daughter and her husband.  They commented on how flavorful the cornbeef was.  I kept right with the recipe, except I did use more water so as to cover the meat.  Because of this I should have added a little more spices for the broth flavoring.   No need to cook cabbage later.  I just kept in the shape of the wedges and placed them on top and it cooked perfectly, not to mushy.

Wonderful recipe and really easy.  I agree with another reviewer who said the bit of vinegar and sugar added to the flavor.  I did cook the potatoes separately because we like them that way.

Flavor was ok, potatoes were good, but the carrots and cabbage  were like mush by the time it spent all day in the slow cooker. 
Next time I might try adding those two items for the last hour on high.

I discovered this recipe by accident. I've been making corned beef in the slow cooker now for several years. I'll not go back to boiling it - ever. In recent years, I've gone to steaming the veggies separately.  So easy, so tasty.  Thanks!

Made it as recipe specifies but added cabbage for last two hours of cooking as suggested.  Was SO good!  Not a drop left after company went home.  Will use this recipe again and again and again.  Thank you!

My family and I really liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly like it is. This is definitely going to be my go to recipe for corned beef. The meat was tender and the flavor was great.

The flavor was great! My only issue was the "point cut" corned beef I used. I would highly recommend using flat cut. By the time I cut all the fat off, I had probably 1.5lb of meat instead of 3. I'm a potato lover so I would add more potatoes also. Will definitely be making this again with the right cut of corned beef.

You saved our corn beef and cabbage night! I wanted to make it for dinner, but didn't have time for complex instructions. Adding all ingredients at the same time meant I could get on with my day and  I didn't need to go to the store for beer and mustard. It came out perfect! Hubby was delighted! The only thing I did different is I used baby potatoes which never need peeling. And they retain their shape better. I make small cut into each one so they can soak in the flavors.

Great recipe and easy with the crock pot.  I love that the corned beef doesn't sit it too much liquid so it isn't soggy, but lovely and tender.

Best corned beef and cabbage I have made yet! Great recipe and very easy! Didn't have apple cider vinegar but it still came out wonderful! I bought a 4 lb. brisket and quartered one red onion, this recipe had just the right amount of veggies (we love our veggies.) I cooked it on slow for 12 hours, the meat melted in our mouths, even the fatty part tasted good! Will be forwarding this recipe to family and friends, can't wait to make it again!

I love this! It is the first time I have ever cooked corned beef. It was delicious! It was also very tender. My husband loved it. I cooked exactly as the directions stated. Also it was an excellent idea to add the cabbage at the last hour of cooking. I prefer a little spicy. So to change it up a bit cut the measurements in half for vinegar and sugar. Add jalapeno or habanero peppers. Use beef stock instead of water adds to the flavor. Viola! Delicious!

I followed this recipe precisely and gave it one star only because the meat was good.  I deducted 4 stars because the flavor of the vegetables and the cabbage overcooked. The meal would have been far more pleasing had I used the corned beef spice packet only, for flavoring.

Never had better cabbage. Followed everything, but omitted the carrots because we don't like cooked carrots. This was great and I am not a fan of beef or potatoes, but this was soooo good.

Bland !  followed the recipe to a tee.  Probably would have tasted better by having all the vegetables with only a bouillon cube for flavor.

This is the first recipe I used for corned beef that asked to add  vinegar. I wanted to be fancy so I tried it.  The vinager ruined the taste.  I added half and  the dish was sour.  Never again.

Turned out real good. Made a few changes. Used russet potatoes with the peel. Used 2cups of broth & 1cup of water. I’m still learning to tweak when to add the cabbage. I don’t want to cook it the whole time. Added it too late this time. But, the meat, potatoes & onion were great. (No carrots)

good recipe, I only omitted the cabbage since I like to cook that separate with onions and bacon.  I also added 1 tspn of crushed red pepper flakes since it gives the broth more flavor.

I actually wound up cooking it for 15 hours.  When it was done I glazed it in the oven with a honey and mustard mixture I had leftover from making chicken wings.  My son said that the corned beef was the best he'd ever eaten.  Everyone loved it.

Used brown sugar instead, as someone else suggested. Turned out great. Even my daughter made it, loved it.

So easy! There was so much in my crock pot the lid wouldn’t close until it cooked down a bit. The vegetables were over cooked. Next time I will put the meat on the bottom and the veggies on top adding the cabbage later. Good flavor.

We loved it.  Only change I will make next time is to put the cabbage in half way through, not at the beginning.  I loved the vinegar and sugar addition, wonderful taste.   Not a morsel was wasted.

Sooo easy and good! I had been making mine wrong by putting the cabbage in too early. Now I know to add it towards the end of cooking time.

As good of corned beef and cabbage as I can ever remember.  And so easy to make.   I did wait till 1 hour before done to add the cabbage.  It was a big hit with my family and guests.

No changes this time, but definitely next time I would use much less water and I would not sprinkle the seasoning on top of the vegetables but on top of the meat because it came out too bland!

I made this on a whim for St. Patrick’s Day.  It turned out amazingly delicious!  I used red potatoes and left the garlic whole.  Didn’t have a Bay leaf, but it is still definitely a keeper!

I like corn beef and cabbage but always found it kinda boring.  This is the first one that actually had some flavor.  I did add an additional tablespoon of pickling spice after reading some thought it bland.

What a great find! I love throwing everything into the slow cooker and forgetting about it. I tweaked things a little because my brisket was smaller than the recipe. We had company over and there wasn't anything left.
I'll make this again.

Disappointing. Didn't have cider vinegar so subbed red wine vinegar. Had 3 1/2 # brisket, put veggies on bottom, brisket on top & added seasonings/water per directions. Potatoes & carrots were still hard ( we like them soft) & brisket was tough after cooking in crockpot on low for 9 hours. Did steam cabbage separately as did not have room for it in crockpot. Will go back to our usual recipe next time we want corned beef.

Very good recipe. Nothing to complain about, but nothing spectacular.  I would use it again.
Maybe a few more potatoes, and a cup less water.  We added the cabbage during the last half of cooking.

Made as written. Very good. Meat was perfect. Taters a little over done. Cabbage a little under done.
Next time will try taters an hour less and cabbage a 1/2 hour more.

Wow! My brisket didn't come with seasoning so I made my own, and added the cabbage halfway through cooking - this was incredible. This will be our forever recipe!

This came out so tender. I used a two pound brisket. I also added 1/2 a packet of dried onion soup mix because my family is allergic to sulfenic acid in onions. I added the cabbage during the last hour. It was amazing. I will be making this for Xmas Eve Dinner from now on. We are starting a new tradition

This is my first time preparing corned beef, this was very flavorful and made a large amount as well, we were eating this for days. I will take others comments about either putting the cabbage in later during the cooking process or cooking on the side next time, the cabbage was brown and the taste of the corned beef was the only flavor in the cabbage, it's still delish!

Another excellent corned beef & cabbage recipe. I also cooked the cabbage a little less, about 3 hours. Good, easy & delicious recipe.

Should have waited 2-3 hours before adding the vegis. They were mushy. :) Tasted great despite that.
