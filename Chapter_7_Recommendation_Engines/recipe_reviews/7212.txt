I subtracted a teaspoon of milk and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. These waffles were crisp on the outside but soft on the inside--very fluffy. I served these with homemade raspberry sauce and we all loved them. NOTE: When I whipped the egg whites, I made sure to chill my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl and the whipping attachment itself before trying to whip them. I really only had an hour but that was just enough time to give me the help I needed. My egg whites seemed to whip up faster and they were quite fluffy.

These waffles were delicious.  I used this recipe for my first time trying waffles.  I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon since another reviewer suggested this.  I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe is the same one my mother uses, except I use melted margarine instead of oil. It's important not to mix these up too much after you fold in the egg whites or they will be flat and chewy. The waffles are fluffy and light because of the egg whites. Also, be sure not to under-cook them. Then they'll turn out soggy. Spray your waffle iron with cooking spray, and make sure they're lightly browned. That's what separates them from the mix. They're wonderful!

Crunchy, chewy and tasty! What more could you want? Though I found when I didn't use a belgium waffle iron they didn't come out quite as nice.

This is my new "go to" waffle recipe. I did make a couple of small changes though. I added about 1tsp of vanilla and I subbed melted butter for the oil. Fabulous!

My first attempt at "from scratch" waffles.  My kids thought this was great!  My daughter usually picks at everything but ate everything on her plate.  I did change the amount of eggs (3) as other reviewer mentioned.

I made these for brunch today. They were great! 
I added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. With the egg whites I whipped them extra long.  
My daughter called them "fat waffle pancakes" I think that is a good thing, she ate them all up!:) 
This is a keeper! Thank you Mary

These were OK - nothing special.  It was my first attempt at waffles from scratch, and I found that I like Bisquick waffles better.  These had a very chewy consistency that I didn't care for.

These are the best waffles I've ever eaten.  If you follow the recipe exactly, you will know what I mean - this beats "waffles in a box" hands down.  The secret to the fluffiness is to whip the egg whites for a while - and folding them in separately from the yolks.  (If you don't separate the eggs and whip them, you might get a chewy, heavier waffle).  As my son has a milk allergy we used rice milk and it turned out just as delicious - you couldn't detect the difference.

They tasted pretty good! However I was hoping for that same taste that I get from a restaurant buffet. I will definatly make these again but I will try with a little more sugar to sweeten them up!

These waffles are ok....too much egg taste though.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, they were much better.  Next time, I would only use three eggs though.

There is no flavor to these. Maybe think about adding so vanilla and sub real butter melted for the oil. I found another recipe that didn't take as much time and was so much better. Back to the drawing board.

I've tried many recipes out there.  These were golden and crisp...but not too crisp.  And the batter is so fluffy.  Beating the egg whites take extra time, but it is so worth it.  I did add vanilla flavoring (I do that to anything I bake anyway).  Plus I did add a pinch of cinnamon and grated nutmeg, not enough to overpower the waffle, but just to deepen the taste experience since my waffle syrup isn't the best. With young kids who drown their waffles in syrup, I don't buy the real maple syrup often. If I had a good maple syrup I might not add the cinnamon and nutmeg.  However, we will make this recipe at least twice a month if not more.

I used this recipe today for the first time with my brand new waffle maker. I added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, to make it just a tad sweeter and we all loved it here! I have a smaller waffle maker (makes 2 at a time) and each waffle was about a 1/2 cup of batter, so I ended up with 10 waffles. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I searched for a waffle recipe because I had buttermilk leftover from something else. This recipe doesn't call for buttermilk, but I used it in place of the milk called for, and the result was wonderful. The kids ate 3 helpings! We ran out of syrup halfway through, so I ate most of mine plain. They were crispy and very flavorful. Yum.

These were pretty good. I've made several waffle recipes, and frankly, can't much tell the difference. But I liked these - they froze well and reheated fine. I made this exactly as written; but I always have trouble getting that "beat egg whites until stiff" step. Definitely worth making again.

This was pretty good. My kids enjoyed it and we ate all of them. The only complaint is that they were a little heavy. I would have liked to see them a bit fluffier.

These waffles are very good, but a little too sweet, the second time I made them I used a teaspoon of sugar instead of a tablespoon.

I have to say that these are the best waffles I have ever had!! I couldn't believe how fluffy they were!! For those who like their waffles crispy, just cook a little longer. I substituted buttermilk for the milk, since I had it on hand. The beaten egg whites are what help make the waffles so fluffy, I certainly wouldn't skip that step. I normally have trouble with my waffles sticking, but not with these. The l/2 cup of oil helps with that problem.  This is a keeper!! Thank you so much for sharing!

These were good.  A little egg-y tasting.  I added 2 tsp vanilla, dash of nutmeg, and a generous sprinkly of cinnamon.  I didn't seperate my eggs - too much work!  Maybe that's why they tasted egg-y.

This recipe came out great, but I didn't follow the recipe all the way. I put bananas, lemon flavor, and almond flavor. Plus my special whipping cream, but it is a secret  whipping cream{homemade}

These are the best Ive ever had. I put a teaspoon and a half of vanilla in and I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I didn't think this recipe was worth the little bit of extra work.  They were soft but seemed almost soggy.  I guess my family prefers the crispier version waffle.

This is without a doubt the best quick and easy waffle I have ever tasted. It's light and fluffy and toasts up very well days later in the toaster or rewarmed in the microwave.  Well worth a try.

After searching for many recipes to try I decided on this one first based on all the reviews.  I was disappointed. It was very blah to me. I added vanilla, otherwise doubled the recipe and went for it.  The search is on for yet another awesome waffle recipe.

I am very picky when it comes to waffles, but this recipe was perfect!  I have some picky eaters around that don't like crispy waffles, this recipe allows you to have a more or less crispy waffle and both are delicious.  I did add some vanilla and a little cinnamon, but the base recipe is so easy to make.  It definitely takes the difficulty out of fresh waffles first thing in the morning!

This is the fifth waffle recipe I've tried, and this is my favorite so far and will probably stopping looking for a basic waffle.  The texture is perfect!  Did add some pumkin spices to the batter.  Very very happy with this recipe!  Thanks..

Great recipe!  Simple and easier than I expected!   I only had whole wheat flour in the house, but it worked.  The waffles were fluffy and delicious even with the whole wheat flour.  I added a little vanilla and wheat germ.  I was such a proud mama watching my girls gobble them up with a little Nutella.

really delicious, eggy recipe, without that weird oily aftertaste that waffles with too much leavening get. versatile, and worth the labor, in my opinion. very impressive, but not very fast. cooks very evenly. I always add some nutmeg and cinnamon for a little extra flavor, but the recipe as is is also good.

These were kind of a pain to make with all the extra dirty bowls but were very good.  It's a good idea to spray the waffle iron with cooking spray, even if it's non-stick.  I use 1/3 cup batter in each well for my waffle maker.  I cook mine for 2 1/2 minutes.  Makes 13 light, crispy, and airy waffles.  Very good!

Too eggy for my tastes (that's all they tasted like!).  The batter was very runny, so they turned out rather thin.  I would have expected loftier waffles with the extra step of folding in whipped egg whites.  Won't make again.

Waffles were fabulous with the following tweaks: I doubled the amount of baking powder, added 1 tsp orange extract (to recipe for 6 servings), and used real butter (melted) instead of vegetable oil.

These waffles came out perfect.  For the uninitiated, like me, I found that cooking them on high, if your wafflemaker has temperature settings, for four minutes, works just fine.  I sprayed the waffle maker with vegetable spray between each batch, because I have a history of having waffles stick and making a big mess.

This recipe is really lovely!  I just made it a few minutes ago.  I love how fluffy the egg whites make the batter.  The texture of the cooked waffles is excellent; crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside.  The taste is slightly sweet and the color, golden.  Thank you for this recipe!  Delicious!

My daughter (15) gave me a waffle iron for Christmas and she made these waffles for me Christmas morning! I simply love them! She did add vanilla and cinnamon for a festive feel. The eggy texture is wonderful. I've made them for my daughter as well, several times since the New Year. I serve them with homemade strawberry butter and pure maple syrup. Simply delicious and fast.

Just tried this and I was disappointed.  I always use the Waffles II, but decided to try something new.  My 9 year old stated there was no taste, then they started sticking.  Never had this problem with the Waffles II recipe.

We got a waffle maker for Christmas & I have been wanting to try it out! Tonight was the night. Breakfast for dinner!!! I served my waffles with an italian sausage & spinach frittata and baked apples. When I tasted the raw batter, it tasted like baking powder. So I added 1/4tsp of pumpkin spice and a little juice from a fresh orange to cut the bitterness. It worked!! My waffles turned out great. I made a blueberry sauce to serve on top!

MMmmm!!! I've used a million different waffle recipes that were all good, but the additional eggs in this one makes them extra fluffy. They were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and airy in the middle. I didn't think they tasted too eggy either, which was as concern. I think this will be my standard recipe from now on!

These tasted to bready. The recipe called "waffles 1" was much better. These ones were light and fluffy but even though I added vanilla, they still had no flavor. I think there was too much egg. It made it seem very bland. I think I"ll stick with "waffles 1"

OMG these were the best waffles I have ever made. We got a new Belgian waffle maker for Christmas and the boxed mixes of course are terrible! So we tried this one and it's so perfect AS IS. Always consistent, even my fairly inexperienced husband can make them perfectly every time. They are light and fluffy yet can also get crispy on the outside like I like if you let them.  Or they can stay completely soft. This recipe is perfect if you have lovers of both soft and crispy in your family! Sometimes we throw in a few handfuls of chocolate chips or blueberries, or just top them with fruit. Perfect with anything you can think of to put on them, can't say enough good things about this recipe. And I love that it helps me teach my hubby techniques like separating eggs and beating egg whites stiff! lol...

Yum! Tender spongey waffle.  My one year old baby would like this waffle with strawberry and maple syrup for dinner EVERY NIGHT forever.  It took 3 bowls to mix but it was very easy and both the one year old and my two year old enjoyed helping. We will be making this recipe again.

I ran out of waffle mix and was I glad. These were the best waffles I ever had. They were very fluffy and flavorful. My daughter and husband couldn't stop eating them. I usually don't eat waffles but after they raved I tried them and loved them too. Worth every minute. I did add vanilla.

This recipe was delicious! Even in my cheepo waffle iron they were super fluffy with a tiny bit of crisp on the outside. Perfect! I made half a recipe, and it was just right for two hungry people - I ate two, my husband ate three (he gives it a seven star rating!). Thanks!

Very nice recipe. It did taste a tad "eggy", but not so much to be offensive. 
I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon. It is a very nice recipe to make if you want yummy waffles, but don't have 2 hrs to make belgium waffles.

Good, but not great.  They are simple, so if you want to highlight a topping or fresh fruit they are a great companion!

Absolutely fantastic! Even my husband says they're the best tasting waffles he's ever had.  I won't be buying any waffle mixes again.

These were delicious, according to my family.  They were much tastier than frozen waffles.  I will definitely make them again.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I used whole wheat flour.  I added a tsp apple pie spice, and a tsp vanilla.  I didn't have any milk, but I did have buttermilk (huh! when does that ever happen!?) so I used buttermilk and they turned out great.  I did not find them at all "eggy".  Whipping the egg whites to make a meringue kept them light.  Loved them, thanks!

This recipe is awesome. I had no problem with the steps or the ingredients. Although I did add my own pizazz to it: 1 tablespoon lemon juice, an extra tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Yummy. No more Bisquick in this house! Thanks Mary!

I loved this recipe. It was just what I was looking for...a tasty light waffle that is easy to make (unlike many that require you to make them the night before). I also altered the recipe to include whole wheat flour and added a banana for extra taste...turned out great!

I have been searching for a better waffle recipe than my previous one, and I have to say, I found it!  I added a little vanilla, and left out a little of the beaten egg white (but not much), and WOW!  These are the BEST waffles I have ever had!  Thank you!

These waffles were delicious!  Unlike other reviewers, we definitely didn't think they tasted like frozen or other commercial brands.  The only downside for us was that they took enough time to make, serve and eat (about 40 minutes), that they will probably be a weekend treat for us.

I make the whole wheat version of this (substitute half the white flour with whole wheat flour) for my kids at least three mornings every week.  They love it and it is healthy!  Great recipe.  This will remain a family favorite.

I found this recipe years ago when looking for a base for a healthier waffle for our children.  I prefer whole wheat flour in lieu of white flour.  

I have used this recipe for years and substituted whole wheat flour 1 for 1 with no problems.  My family loves it and the whole wheat flour gives waffles a great nutty flavor.  I like the idea of swapping 1t vanilla for 1 t of the milk, however the whole wheat flour already gives waffle a wonderful flavor.  With whole wheat, one waffle can be quite filling.

I am on the hunt for the perfect waffle recipe and I thought I would give this a try.   I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla.   I think the addition of the folded egg whites made for a light waffle which I liked very much.  I also think the flavor was very good.   The only problem I had was the waffle was not crispy.   I think to be a great waffle you have to have a crispy outside.   Good, but, not great.  Probably won't make again...guess I am still on the hunt for the elusive perfect waffle.

Delicious! They are crispy on the outside, beautifully light and tasty. For the reviewers that did not have success with this recipe, here are some suggestions: do not overbeat or over mix - not when you mix the yolk/milk mixture with flour and again not when you fold in the egg white.
Thanks for posting, this is my new favorite waffle recipe.

The waffles are supper fluffy inside with a slightly crisp edge. The only thing I changed was - I only added 2 tablespoons of sugar, because we eat our waffles with honey or maple syrup anyways.  Thanks!

OMG YUMMMMMMMMMMY!   I do add 1 teaspoon vanilla... and when whipping the egg whites I add 1/8 teasp of Cream O Tarter PER EGG to em... I whipped them until SUPER STIFF PEAK where you turn off beaters while in the egg whites and pull up to check if peaks are forming and if soft and wet or stiff and firm and I make em so stiff they stay on beaters in big fat ball without drooping..and the texture of the batter was incredibly fluffy and stayed that way... we heated our waffle iron for a long time until it was smokin hot AN ORIGINAL 1950'S APPLIANCE THAT WORKS EXCELLENT 63 YEARS LATER STILL LOL .. spritz with oil... and the scoop of batter sizzles when you put in on and close the lid.. leave alone at least three minutes or so... then when you lift lid it pops loose no problem... the texture was AIRY and crispyness varies as to how toasty you allow them to get... we like em quite toasty golden brown.. but not dark brown.. those are considered burnt.. but oh they are fabulous when golden brown with an egg on top or chopped apples and cinn and drizzle with syrup... really excellent recipie... the folding in of the whipped eggs made the texture blue ribbon quality lol... I think the cream o tarter allows them to stay and to hold up the fluffiness of the heavier batter better since the merangue basically is stronger.. anyway.. ten stars out of five lol...  add vanilla too I did!

Good waffle recipe which uses beaten egg whites to lighten the batter for a light crisp waffle.  Its a little more work but worth the effort. You can add whatever you want to this recipe with good result but make your additions before you fold in the egg whites so you don't deflate the batter

I’ve made several waffle recipes and they all taste pretty much the same to us.  This waffle had a light texture, however we felt it definitely needs vanilla or other flavoring extract.

Excellent recipe! We had this for breakfast today. Requires no tweeking.. just follow recipe. I do suggest if using extra large eggs, to only use 3 as I did.

This was my first time making waffles from scratch.  These were excellent.  I used one less egg and I had to add a little bit more milk to the batter because it was so thick I couldn't spread it in the waffle iron.  Great waffles.  Goodbye Bisquick!

I had lost my tried & tested waffle recipe but then found this one! Close 2nd! Add vanilla for more flavour and you've got it!

I used butter instead of the oil....plus I added brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to the batter....I would recommend serving straight out of the iron...I kept mine in the oven and they had a funny texture to them after sitting for a while...but fresh they were pretty good...I'll try another recipe the next time...

This recipe could definitely be improved upon.  I probably won't make this one again.  I agree with one reviewer who said they were tasteless.

Delicious!  These were light and fluffy and yummy!  Definitely a little more effort than opening a box of bisquick but well worth it.  The only thing I did differently was I sifted the flour mixture with a wire whisk because I dont have a sifter.  Other than that I will definitely be making these waffles again!  Thank you!

Forgot to mention 1 batch made 3.5 waffles in our maker which is round with the 4 triangle shapes and is approx. 8.5
inches in diameter.  We doubled the recipe so the kids would have left-overs to put in the toaster in the morning.  :)

These are a very yummy waffle!  True to the description, they are very eggy.  I used whole white flour and canned milk to make them a higher protein, high fiber breakfast.  I also also added a cup of petite blueberries and a teaspoon of real vanilla.  My son asks for "my" waffles every morning!

This was a simple, yet wonderful recipe. The waffles turned out looking great, and had a spongy texture to them. They tasted great, but were actually easy to make.

The taste was good, but the batter was VERY runny.  After a disasterous 1st attempt on my waffle maker, I added some extra flour to get the right consistency and thought they were great.  Followed earlier reviews and added vanilla and cinnamon -- might try pecans, and substituting a reduced amount of butter for the oil the next time.  Nice texture and flavour.  An earlier review also suggested not using spray on your non-stick waffle maker b/c of the amount of oil....tried it, failed miserably, won't try it again!  :o)

Great recipe. it sets a high standard.  I will try the vanilla next time.  I was wondering if anyone had replaced the oil with, maybe, a half cup of melted butter!... Brilliant..   I will test it soon and it will be great.. I will let you know.

i really liked the flavor and texture of these waffles. they were very fluffy and airy when chewing them, and i like how the texture was also strong enough to hold its own and not crumble up. they weren't dry at all, so you're not forced to put endless amounts of butter and syrup on them. in the mix, i did use butter instead of oil, and i used heaping tablespoons of sugar. great with any topping.

Wonderful waffles!  They turned out light, fluffy, and delicious.  I added vanilla, nutmeg, and an extra tablespoon of sugar.  They were a big hit with the kids.  I had to do a doubletake on the one tablespoon of baking powder though.   I almost put in a teaspoon instead.  I think that may be the reason some people had trouble with the waffles coming out too hard.  Anyway, I'll definately make these again!

The taste of this waffle was awesome, so was the texture-nice and crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. I added 1 t vanilla.

I'll be using my waffle iron a lot more!  I'll never buy the "boxed" stuff again.  My 2 and 3yos gobbled them up.  I had a brain freeze and forgot to whip the whites, just folded them in and it was still fluffy and soft, can't wait to try them made right.

This is my go-to recipe for waffles. I do decrease the oil and use only two Tbsp and then increase the milk by six Tbsp. The waffles are light and fluffy. I have a professional cast iron waffle maker and also a regular home style waffle maker. The waffles in the professional waffle maker are always better, fluffier and crispy on the outside. If anyone has trouble with this recipe, the problem might be your waffle maker.

This is my favorite waffle recipe. I usually sub 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour. I use a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for extra flavor. Topped with homemade apple sauce these are the best!

LOVE LOVE LOVE, this recipe. Found it online somewhere years ago when my kids were very small and was a stay at mom. So glad I found it again!! Boyfriend and kids love crispy yet tender waffles and these are IT!! I made according to recipe swapping some of the milk for 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Freezer is now stocked with homemade waffles.

I used to make waffles from this recipe pretty regularly years ago. But then I moved to a new home etc... This weekend, for Christmas breakfast, I decided to break out the waffle iron and am so glad to have found the recipe again. Super easy and ALWAYS a family pleaser. Crispy on the outside, light and soft on the inside. I love love love this recipe. 
Two things: 
1. I use 1/2 the salt.... 1 tsp is too much salt.
2. Add 1 tsp or so of good vanilla.

These waffles have been a Sunday morning tradition for our family.  add a bit of vanilla extract if you'd like, sometimes we add cinnamon too:)  With our family we make two batches and freeze the rest to make through the week.

These are fantastic, been making them for years. They deserve five stars as written. Adding vanilla or cinnamon is good too if you like that--I add it sometimes other times I follow as written. Thank you for this recipe.

They tasted fine but nothing to write home about. My kids didn't like them, but I think they are used to the frozen kind....probably would taste better if it had butter, vanilla extract, etc in it.

Really quite good. I made some changes, however: I added 1 extra tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 extra egg white (so it ended up being 5 egg whites and 4 egg yolks) and about 1/8 C extra milk. They turned out very flavorful, but not exactly with the crispy texture I usually associate with waffles. I would definitely make them again, though.

These are pretty good waffles, but I don't think they are the best.  I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla and sometimes blueberries or pecans.

This is a basic waffle recipe - just what I was looking for. I paired mine with strawberries and peaches and some buttery syrup - it was delicious. I will definitely use it again and again. Thank You.

The waffles were great.  They were fluffy yet filling all of the same time.  Adding a little vanilla in them adds a good flavour.

Great recipe.  Didn't have baking powder in the house so I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of self rising.  I added a little vanilla to the wet ingredients and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry.  Came out great.  Reminded me of a cross between a waffle and french toast.  I will make again.  Thanks!

These waffles were ok but I have had better.  The texture was a little too hard & eggy for my personal taste. I dont think I will be making these again. Thanks though.

Good, but not fabulous, which is what  I expected from the reviews.  This was a lot of mess for the end result.  I had to dirty 3 bowls and go through 3 different steps for something that could just as easily be achieved with a mix.

These waffles were so fluffy and tasty!  Everytime I have a frozen waffle I think, Why am I eating this?  These waffles are SO MUCH BETTER!  I cooked them on a grilled cheese maker and they still came out perfect!  If you want an absolutely fluffy and perfect waffle, try this recipe!

I am making these waffles right now, and my husband and I just tried the first ones that came off the iron....they're the best we've ever had!  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and only used a teaspoon of baking powder.  They really don't take a lot of effort to make, which is very good for us because I just don't have time to make really involved recipes.  This is now "our" waffle recipe!
