This is a very simple recipe to make, certainly easy but based on just a cornflake crusting, I knew it would lack major flavour!  See my tweaks for the additions I made

I made this exactly as the recipe said to. Everyone really enjoyed it, I will make it again. It was a little messy to prepare but it is worth it.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but in reality, it wasn't what I expected. I found it to be quite bland and too mushy. Too much cinnamon. My husband thought it was somewhat edible but said, "This tastes like another dish... I can't figure out which one." "Apple pie?" I said. "THAT'S IT!" he said. Basically, it tasted to us like apple pie made with canned apples with some pork in it.

I tweaked it a little bit. Didn't use the cinnamon, mixed the apples into a pork flavored stove top stuffing and stuffed them and used Frosted Flakes instead of corn flakes my wife loves them and I thought they were delicious as well
