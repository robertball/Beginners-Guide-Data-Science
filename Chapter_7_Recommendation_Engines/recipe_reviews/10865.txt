these are decadent!  I don't like almonds, so I just added more hazelnuts, and a nice twist, to make them prettier, is to dip them in chocolate, after they cool.  Very wonderful recipe.

did not work boiling the egg whites. Try just cooking like a macaroon.

Super good! I followed your instructions with another reviewer's measurments (200 g almonds, 3 egg whites, 165 g sugar) and they turned out beautiful and delicious. Everyone wants me to make more.

These are the cookies, I believe I've been looking for.   But
First of I didn't quite understand over 5 cups of almonds. So after blanching , fine chopping I used about a cup and a half.  I proceeded with the recipe. Everything was fine. Second cooking them on parchment paper the bottoms burned and the tops were sticky.  Also the waiting batter changed sort of seperated. What did I do wrong?
