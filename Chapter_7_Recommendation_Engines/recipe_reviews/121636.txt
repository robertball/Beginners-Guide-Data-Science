I made this dish as written except for one thing... I did NOT do ground beef but instead used smoked sausage, and I used smoked ham hocks. (I kept thinking that the ground beef would make it more like chili instead of beans and rice.) Everything else was the same (oh, I cooked it about 45 mins longer, too) and the end result was a smokey, yummy meal!

Great recipe.  It is almost identical to the one I make.  The only difference is i use smoked sausage cut into tiny pieces instead of ground beef.

Hey, y'all!  These are definitely southern pintos!  Fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was use 6 slices of hickory smoked bacon instead of the ham hocks.  What a great mixture of flavors!  Don't leave out the bay leaves!  It gives that great "What is that?"

This recipe is Awesome! I recently tried this recipe and talk about authentic flavor! I made two alterations to this recipe...I traded out country ham and spicy breakfast sausage for the meats! I pulsed the country ham pieces in the food processor because they were hard to cut. If you are looking for a good recipe try this one!

I cooked this recipe for Sunday dinner.  I used black beans instead of red and added cumin, oregano, paprika, and smoked turkey necks (instead of ham hocs).  Fabulous!

Just realized I had not rated this.  It was wonderful - used ham hocks and chorizo instead of ground beef (Emeril says use Andoullie ? sausage, which I did not have). Can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow. We like it HOT!

I followed this recipe exactly and was pretty disappointed. It ended up being very bland. I bet that using sausage instead of ground beef (as many reviewers did) would have much better results. As it is, this recipe was not worth the time it took to cook.

Wow.  This is a great recipe!  I also omitted the hamburger, and used a slice of smoked ham instead of the ham hocks.  I wanted it yet a bit smokier, so I also added about a tablespoon of liquid smoke, and that really did the trick.  I made the rice with extra butter and garlic powder, and the combo was a force to be reckoned with!  Hats off to the chef!

I am from Canada and have never had red beans and rice. This was a very comforting and tasty dish and my family really liked it. The ingredients are simple and it is very tasty on a cold night.

This is a bland recipe, I tried adding more seasonings and hot sauce to give it some life, but I'm still stuck with a big pot of bland beans and rice in my fridge.  Not at all like my friends in NOLA make...maybe I should get their recipe.

I think that it was missing something. I added more spices as per someone's suggestion...maybe it was because I didn't use sausage, but I only had the meat...but I used a smoked ham bone from Christmas ham dinner. And I missed the part about leaving it uncovered, so I had a TON of broth and no "sauce"...I'm definitely making this again to try with the sausage, I think that might make this a good 4 star recipe. As it stands, it's way too bland.

This is a great base recipe. I used canned black beans, dark and light red kidney beans. I still soaked them in the same manner to ensure flavor.  I exchanged the ground beef for kielbasa.  Save the liquid that you drain off of the beans.  Cut the kielbasa into small pieces and cook with onions (I added fresh mushrooms and green peppers.)  For kick, I added cumin and chilli pepper to it.  I cooked a bag of rice with the liquid I drained from the beans.  There should also be enough to cook the liquid into the beans and rice when it is all mixed together.  Gradually add the liquid in and let it soak in.  Then add more until you have used most of it or it will not soak in anymore.  Hope you enjoy!

Good flavor.  I used a lb of little smoked sausages instead of ground beef.  I also mashed up some bean while cooking to make a thick sauce.

Not very good. What is cajun seasoning? I used extra red pepper. It was bland and dry.

I've been enjoying this recipe for over a year now. However you choose to tweak it, it is definitely the place to start. If I could only take one recipe from this site, this would be the one. Thanks Jackie!

This is a good recipe. I don't eat red meat, so I made this meatless and added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles and onions. This was very good. Thanks!

Excellent, great flavor.  Two things- one, I only used 3 quarts of water.  I thought 4 seemed like a lot, and even 3 was too much.  I will use 2 1/2 next time.  Two- I had to let it cook for 6 hours to get to the right consistency- but it was well worth the wait.  Again, probably because of too much water.  This was great and I will definitely make it again!

No taste to it.  I have had red beans n rice many times.  I made it exactly according to the directions.  Maybe it was supposed to be a smoked ham hock instead of ham hock in the ingredients.  I had to add so many spices after it was finished just to make it edible.  Will never make this recipe again.

I had never made red beans before even though I live in Louisiana. My husband LOVED this recipe.  The only thing I did was used sausage instead of ground meat.

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of the people who came before me and ditched the ground beef for smoke sausage AND I added a half a pound of maple bacon. Ham hocks, smoked sausage and maple bacon made for a hearty red beans and rice dish. I do recommend Jasmine rice. Even better than my mom's recipe, God rest her soul.

This wasn't a bad recipe, but certainly not the best I've had.  I used sausage instead of ground beef, which gave it a little more flavor, but the beans were still very bland.  Next time I'll just make the red beans the same way I make my pinto beans.
