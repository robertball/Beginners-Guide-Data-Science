These veggies were very, very good!  After reading the other reviews, here's what I did.  I peeled 3 potatoes (not 2) and cut them into chunks (not cubes).  I placed them in a baking bag.  I mixed the oil and soup mix (Lipton Herb & Garlic) together, then put about 3 tsp of the mix into the bag and shook it up.  I baked the potatoes for 15 minutes while I cut up the other veggies.  I left out the zucchini and added onion wedges.  I took the bag out of the oven and added the rest of the veggies and the oil/soup mix and shook it up good.  Baked for another 30 minutes.  It was excellent!  Potatoes and carrots were nice and soft.  Leave out the salt, you don't need it.  I can't wait to wrap these veggies in tin foil and throw them on the grill!  Thanks for the recipe!

A great recipe! And the veggies don't come out dry, as they do in so many others I've tried. For our great results, we did this: mixed the olive oil and soup mix together first; tossed the potatoes with a small portion of the mixture and started them cooking; tossed the rest of the veggies with the mix and added them to the potatoes after 15 minutes; cooked them all another 40 minutes (but could have pulled them out at 30 minutes). Also, we added small, whole mushrooms, which we all love. We doubled this recipe to serve 7 people; everyone had their fill plus second helpings, and there were about 3 servings left over. My kids aren't crazy about vegetables, but they ate this and said it tasted like it was hot off the grill! All the adults loved it.

MY FAMILY LOVED THIS DISH!!  It was so tasty...I have never seen the bowl of veggies gone before the main dish until tonight.  No leftovers.  It is sooooo easy and the hardest part is peeling the potatoes.  Although this side dish goes well with almost any meal...try them with the Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe also found on this site.  The combination is to die for!

My husband and my kids thought this dish was very, very good. I, however, thought it was a little on the sweet side obviously due to the onion soup mix. Although I'll make this again, I think next time I'll use the Lipton garlic and herb mix instead.

Quick and easy way to eat your veggies.  I added some chicken broth to the pan and it enhanced the delicious flavor.

Great tasting recipe! I boiled and cut the potatoes into chunks before putting it in the oven to make it more tender. Also, I stirred the onion soup mix with the chicken broth and added mushrroms into it before pouring it over the vegetables. The smell is so goood.....and it comes out so tasty! (I omitted onions and zuchinni in my recipe but used broccoli, carrots & frozen green peas instead. )

This went over okay with the kids, not wow, but good.  I liked it, & even more so the next day.  I had a bag of vegetable medley (already cut up broccoli, cauliflower & baby carrots), I used that & exempted the zucchini (although I love it).  I'm thinkin' that the kids were turned off by the brown color that the veges turned from the soup mix.  I am going to make it again, but using the garlic herb like Linda suggested, or maybe even the lipton ranch, YUM.  Thanks Klara ;)

Baked Vegetables I Haiku: "Won't work as written. It wouldn't cook evenly. So has to be changed." Before delving into the reviews, it was obvious that if prepared as the recipe was submitted, you'd end up w/ pebble-hard potatoes,  disintegrating zucchini, and broccoli smoosh. I used the ratio of ingredients as listed, but I steamed the potatoes and carrots briefly in the microwave 1st, then tossed everything in the pan w/ the EVOO and onion soup. After about 40 min., the texture of the veggies was spot-on, the taste was pretty good, but the color was dingy due to the soup powder. I served the veggies w/ a little grated parm, which was nice, and perhaps if I make this again, I'd bake it w/ parm (as well as some paprika and garlic) mixed in. This recipe definitely can't be rated highly as written, and due to all of the reviewers also making changes to the prep, I hover around a 3.5

Great veggies!  I threw some cut up beets I needed to use in there as well.  That's why my veggies look a little pink in my picture ;)  The onion soup gives these a nice seasoning.  Yum!!

These were the best vegetables I've had in a long time. Because of previous comments, I cut my potatoes into smaller chunks but I ended up overcooking vegetables slightly. They were still good. Also added green & red peppers and cauliflower.

These were fantastic!  The family motored through it.  I put the cut-up veggies in a ziploc bag with the olive oil and onion soup mix and did a shake-n-bake kind of thing before cooking.  DEElicious!

Very good.  You can put in any vegetables you want.  I did mix all of the ingredients together with the vegetables before baking.  Very easy, and great flavor.

This recipe is a favorite!  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and mixed the vegetables with the onion soup mix and olive oil before adding the vegetables to a 9x13 inch pan.  I also added the potatoes 15 minutes prior to the other vegetables, and I should've put the carrots in 5 or 10 min. before the other vegetables as well, as they were still rather hard.  I think this recipe is based very much on the onion soup mix-if yours is salty, don't add any extra salt!!  Otherwise, it's perfect, and such easy prep!

I followed the advice of others and mixed the oil and the onion soup mix. I , then baked the potatoes and carrots with a little of the soup and oil mixture for 15 minutes before I added the rest of te vegetables. I, also, added 2 small red onions. I did not add extra salt. I got most of my vegetables at the farmer's market. We both really enjoyed it . I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe.  I followed other reviewers advice by putting the potatoes in first (with the seasons and oil) for 15-20 minutes while I cut the other veggies up. Then I added carrots, onion, sweet potato (with the seasons and oil) for 15 minutes.  Then I added zucchini and broccoli for the last 15 minutes stirring it occasionally throughout the cooking process.  Then I covered it all in bacon bits--because everything tastes better with bacon.  I added cheese on it for my kids, but I liked it without cheese.  It was delicious, my 2 year old ate it well and my 4 year old even said, "Thanks mom, this is delicious."

My husband (who doesn't like vegetables) wolfed this down!  It was absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe hoping for some leftovers for the next day, but we ate the entire panfull.  Yum!  Thanks Klara!

OMG a way to make veggies tasty! I'm as bad as a little kid when it comes to eating veggies.  I have a bag of fire roasted frozen veggies I used...adding onion soup and throwing it in the oven was great! Thanks so much!  Maybe I'll actually eat veggies more often now!

This was excellent! I add a different variety of vegetables every time - zucchini, summer squash, whatever. I follow the advice of others though and cook the potatoes first as they take longer than others. Thanks though!

I doubled the recipe (but only used one large potato - cooked first for 15 minutes), used thawed frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh, added bell peppers + onion, and used montreal steak seasoning mixed with a little lemon juice instead of soup mix. It took longer to cook in the oven, of course. I served half one night with grilled steak marinated in the same seasoning. The next night I cooked chicken breasts with a fajita packet (according to directions) and stirred in the leftover veggies toward the end. Served w/ whole wheat tortillas, salsa and sour cream! Oh yum.

I have used this recipe twice and plan to use it in the future.  The potatoes definetly should be partially cooked ahead of time.  I also like to add a little soy sauce to make it a little juicier and more flavorful.

This was good .  Used cauliflower, broccoli,carrots  onions wedges and dry herb & garlic soup mix.  No potatoes.  I will make this again.  The only change would be to use less olive & mix it all in a bowl first being sure to cover all the veggies lightly. A little EVO goes a long way  Also I'll steam my potatoes in microwave first and then add them to the veggies.  This is a great way to use up the extra veggies we all seem to accumulate in our fridge.

A nice tasty side dish. To make this more substantial, I doubled the potatoes. I also added an onion, omitted the zucchini, and used frozen broccoli. I roasted all the vegetables save the broccoli for about twenty minutes and then added the broccoli for another twenty. A good shake of granulated garlic added a lot.

These were so yummy and a big hit! I used onion soup mix and did not think it was too sweet as others had commented. To cook the veggies I followed the review by Creed. I used more potatoes so mine took a little longer to cook, but they were definitely awesome! Thanks

I needed a side dish inspiration and this did the trick. I prepared it with unpeeled red potatoes, onion wedges, baby carrots and broccoli (it's what I had on hand). I tossed the veggies in the oil and then sprinkled it with the onion powder. It was a different way of seasoning and it was good! I only regret not covering with foil to bake--it took a long time for the veggies to get tender.

I made a few modifications to the recipe (using what we had on hand) and both my husband and myself LOVED this recipe!!!  I used frozen, cubed hash brown potatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, baby carrots, and frozen broccoli.  I didn't even bother to thaw the potatoes or broccoli first.  Very good.  Very easy.  Definately one to add to the box!!

This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. The onion soup mix gave the vegetables a great flavor. I used prepeeled baby carrots instead of slicing my own, and I added 1/2 of a small package of frozen broccoli instead of buying them fresh. The carrots took the longest to cook. 15-20 minutes into the vegetables cooking I stirred them and added more olive oil to make sure that all of the vegetables got moist. Thanks to this website I have another great recipe to add to my collection!

These are the most tasty vegetables I've ever made at home before. I used potatoes, carrots, peppers, and broccoli (instead of zuccini) and wished I'd put in even more. I bought a dry powder soup/dip package of Garlic Herb and it worked out great.  Also, I left the skin on the potatoes (I used small red ones) and boiled them before baking so that they would be sure to be cooked.  I also put the veggies in one of those oven bags so I could lock in the flavor and moisture.  It only took me 25 min to finish baking them in the bag, and everything tasted great. Thanks for whoever submitted this recipe!

My boyfriend, who does not usually like vegetables, loved this recipe.  I did have to change a couple of things, but overall it was fine.  Cooking time was a little bit long, and I had to add a couple tablespoons of water.  I noticed some other people adding chicken broth, but I am a vegetarian, and water did just fine.  Steaming the potatoes for a little before combining them with the other veggies would cut down time in the oven.

Used broccoli/cauliflower medley, red pepper chunks, onion wedges, zuccini, red potatoes, & carrots. Took a lot longer to bake, and the olive oil/sauce did burn in the pan a bit. I think steaming the veggies a bit in broth beforehand would work really well. Otherwise great taste and a big hit at the family potluck.

i didn't use onions, although the next time I make this I will, I added sweet potatoes in with the other vegetables, and everyone raved over these veggies. Definitely a recipe to keep.

Every time I make this I get loads of compliments! I never use all the olive oil the recipe calls for. I use an olive oil sprayer instead to cut down on calories. Very tasty dish!!

I absolutely LOVED this dish!  When I put it in the oven, I forgot about it, and it filled my house with the most wonderful smell while baking.  I blended everything in a large bowl to save time and then scooped it in the pan.  This was well worth the effort, and so tasty.  Thank you!

These were delicious and versatile. Per previous reviews, I peeled and cut potatoes into chunks and put them in a dish with the carrots then microwaved them 10 minutes stirring 1/2 way through. I used baby carrots cut in 1/2. I put the oil and soup mix in a large bowl, poured in all the veggies and stirred to coat. Baked per instructions on a large baking sheet. Since I was taking these to a potluck, I transferred them once they were done into a 9 X 13 pan & baked them a few more minutes to make sure the pan was hot. These were a huge hit - got asked for the recipe several times. Will make these a lot! I doubled the recipe for 18 people and had some left over.

I wasnt crazy about this recipe. It was just okay. The different veggies seem to cook at different times which was aggravating. Im sure if you got this down to a science this would be good. Flavor ok.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of boiling my potato chunks for a few minutes before they went into the oven. Even with the boiling they still needed more baking time. Unfortunately the broccoli and zucchini were done, so I pulled the dish out to salvage those (plus my main dish was done). The carrots were also way undercooked. I think the soup mix was too dry so I added some veggie broth just for moisture and I'm glad I at least did that. This has potential but needs some adjustment. I notice that many of the 5 star ratings are based on adjustments and not the original recipe. Maybe I'll make it again combining the reviews and some adjustments.

These were a wonderful variation from same o'-same o' veggies; I used to think the only way to get a good mix on bits of veggies left over after the bulk of them were used for their intended recipe, was to throw in a stir-fry, but this blows that method away!  Changes I made: used canned new potatoes (all I had at the time), sliced fresh mushrooms, zuchinni, baby carrots (took the longest to cook), sweet onions, broccoli and half a green pepper. I added a little more EVOO, once I saw the volume of veggies I had; I also mixed in some minced garlic, because we are a BIG garlic family! Cooking time was spot-on, too...thank you!

Great recipe. Each time I made it I used small red potatoes, zucchini, a large sweet potato, about a third of a spaghetti squash (with the flesh pulled out into its signature "strings," not the rind or anything--gave it great texture), lots of garlic (gave each clove a good bang with the broad side of a big knife to get the juices going first), oyster mushrooms, onion (I think I used about half an onion as I am not an onion girl), and carrot. Also added tofu cubes (extra firm, fried a little in a skillet first) onceThis was great with Lipton's Savory Herb with Garlic soup mix. I didn't measure out my quantities and did bake it at 450° half the time. All in all, this seems pretty fool-proof. Definitely not a recipe you have to measure or time at all.

Just pretty good. Not the best. The carrots turned out the best, and i would suggest cooking the potatoes on their own first.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was a hit. Everyone was asking for the recipe. The only change I made was the type of soup mix. I looked all over for the Lipton Herb and Garlic and couldnt find it. Maybe we dont have it in Canada. I ended up trying two different soup mixes. I used the Lgvipton Roasted garlic and onion and Knorr's herb and garlic. Both were great, but the Knorr was the favorite. You also dont really need the potatoes but if you do use them follow the advice from the others. Cook the potatoes on their own for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the veggies. Otherwise your will end up with over done veggies. Thanks from me and many others for this recipe!!!!!!

This was okay...though it looked pretty.  I used the garlic & herb mix with carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, red, yellow, orange, and green peppers.  I made it for Christmas - some liked it, some didn't.

This had good flavor but my zuchinni was really soggy. We did like the flavor of the brocolli and potatoes but the carrots were still not soft. I think with a few modifications this can be perfected. Nice flavor though! Thanks for posting this Klara.

The veggies came out great. Made them for a family gathering and they were a hit. Took suggestions from other reviewers and combined the soup mix and olive oil first, then drizzled over the veggies in a big bowl to mix it all up. Also used yellow squash to add more color.

Great and healthy side dish!!!  Only had half a pack of onion soup mix that was left over from another recipe and it was still GREAT!  I used potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, and onions.  I followed others suggestions and put the potatoes and carrots in for 20 min then put the rest of the veggies in for the remaining 25 minutes and everything came out perfect!

This is a great recipe and a nice foundation. I have mixed it up by putting in different vegetables - cauliflower, squash, more onions, zucchini, etc. I have also brought it to pot lucks and it is always a hit!

This is a good recipe for an easy, healthy side to any dish. To speed things up, I used baby carrots and baby potatoes. I couldn't find the onion soup mix thing so I used onion flakes and I didn't think it really added anything to the dish. I mostly like this recipe because it's easy prepare and absorbs the flavors of anything you put it with. I served them under asian chicken so it came out quite tasty.

These were very good, better the next day. Extremely wonderful in a brunch casserole: 6 beaten eggs poured over these veggies and cooked ham, bacon or sausage baked in a greased casserole dish for 45 min and then sprinkled with cheese, baked another 5 minutes (or until egg is set).

So good.  So easy.   I took the advice of other reviewers, and started cooking the potatoes while I chopped the rest of the vegetables. I didn't have zucchini, so I used a yellow pepper instead. Also, I didn't bother adding any salt since onion soup mix is salty enough on its own.  I will totally be making this again.

Veggies are great this way! I toss in any vegetables we have to use up and we inevitably eat them all. This is also very good with smoked sausage thrown in toward the end of the cooking time. Thank you!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I.  The vegetables were absolutely amazing.  The only changes I made...I did not add potatoes because we are on a low carb diet so instead I added sliced mushrooms and one sliced Vadalia onion.  When all the veggies were in the dish, I poured olive oil (I don't really measure when I cook) and sprinkled one packet of Lipton Onion dry soup.  I then also added some Marsala wine.  Mixed the vegetables with a spoon and covered the dish with aluminum foil. After 50 minutes, the vegetables came out amazing.  What a great taste!  My boyfriend raved about them.  I loved them too; will absolutely be making them again.

An EXCELLENT recipe!  I recently made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  It was easy to prepare ahead of time, and the guests were so impressed.  I used baby new potatoes and left them with the skins on which sped up the prep, and I also added whole cloves of garlic.  What an easy, delicious, healthy recipe — thank you!

The veggies were pretty good.
I added strips of red bell pepper.  For the seasoning I used a Good Seasons packet, herb de provence and red pepper flakes.  (I did not put in the salt in written recipe because of the good seasons)
Also, 1/2 hour was way probably 10 minutes too long for this recipe.  My veggies were pretty mushy.
I would try this again, but would bake for only 20 minutes.

I liked the idea of this recipe but the veggies tasted burnt.  Maybe next time I will use a bag as suggested and cook lower or less time.  Will try again!

This was really good, I used carotts, onions, cauliflower, broccoli and red potatoes. Next time I'll probably only bake them for 35-40 minutes as 45 was just a little too much. I hate mushy veggeis, and these didn't turn out mushy at all. I think I'm going to experiment with the seasoning, I didn't realize until afterwards that the packets have MSG and corn syrup. As much as I love my sweets I like to keep my veggies healthy so I know that I'm eating something that is good for me.

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  I think everyone liked it.  There wasn't much left over but no one really raved about it.  It was a nice change from ordinary vegetable dishes.  The vegetables had a good flavor,especially the potatoes. I did cook the potatoes first for about 20 minutes as suggested by other reviewers but still it took a longer than recipe called for. I will make it again soon.

This recipe was great! I used frozen seasoned red potatoe wedges, cooked them alone in the oven for 10 min, threw some frozen veggies in and added the oil and soup mix and violla, dinner about 10 min later!! :) I only used 1 packette of soup mix and I thought it was a bt salty so I wouldn't add the additional salt.
This will be a staple at my house.

Pretty good and surely a different way to cook the broccoli and other veggies than the same ole way lol. Also fairly simple (always a plus)! I think next time I will try to mix the oil and seasonings with the veggies and then pour all into the pan for more even seasoning etc.

We thought it was delicious!  I was in a great rush, so rather than chopping, I made this using tiny white rose potatoes, baby carrots, and onion wedges (could have used pearl onions but didn't want to pay the high price), with 1 pkt of Ranch soup/dip mix.  Using the small veggies made prep time about 2 minutes! I baked it in a foil packet (for lack of the roasting bag suggested by many reviewers)which worked great.

I fed 6 people, but since I used handfuls of vegetables rather than a chopped amount of each, it's hard to gauge the total amount.  Our only complaint, if you can call it that because everyone loved it, was that the seasoning was a little weak...delicious, but not quite strong enough.  Next time, I'll use 2 packets of Ranch or try another flavor. With 2 thumbs up from each family member, I'll definitely make this again!

I find using the smallest of the red new potatoes everything works out fine, but add broccoli and/or cauliflower later, along with Mushrooms.  Have even thrown in large chunks of celery also, along with whole plum tomatoes, adding them a little later also.  Good.

This recipe was good - it does need some tweaking though.  You need to bake the potatoes at least 15 minutes more than the rest of the veggies.  I also tried to stir the veggies at least once or twice during cooking so that the onion soup/olive oil mixture didn't burn.  It does help to spray your pan or dish with a non-stick cooking spray also.

The recipe was good although I found by the time the potatoes had fully cooked the other vegetables were a bit overdone.  The taste was excellent.

BEST EVER!!! Holy cow I could eat the whole batch! Both my husband and I were shocked at how good this was. I assume the brand and type of onion soup packet would reflect the taste, but man ours was so good. Highly recommend!!

I read a couple reviews before I made this, so I changed it a little. I put the potatoes in for fifteen minutes and then added the rest of the veggies. I thought I had broccoli but realized I didn't so I made mine without. The carrots were still a little hard and crunchy so next time I would probably cook potatoes and carrots together first and then add the rest. But it tasted really good. I especially liked the zucchini.

Unbelievably awesome and easy!!  Did zucchini, mushrooms, cauliflower, onions, potatoes, and broccoli.  Added chicken broth as other reviewers mentioned.  Also covered the pan to let the veggies get a perfect steaming.  It was fantastic!

This was a very flavorful and excellent way to enjoy a variety of vegatables.  I substituted 1 yellow squash for the zucchini because that's what I had on hand, used frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh, added about 1/4 yellow onion cut into thick wedges, substitued herb and garlic dry soup mix for the onion soup mix.  I used just shy of a 1/4 cup of olive oil, but I will only use about 1/8 cup next time because that would be plenty.  Thanks for the super recipe!

Easy recipe and very tasty.  I used the spray olive oil.  I also put some lemon pepper on the vegetables instead of salt.  I  went easy on the dry onion soup mix.  I loved all the color.  I put red bell peppers in the dish also

This is so easy, quick and good! You can use any kind of dry soup mix for a diff. taste.I put green pepper cut in larger pieces, Leave Brocoli larger with some stem on also. Only cut the potatoes in half. Wont over cook this way.  Put them all in a plastic bag and shake in the dry soup mix, put into the pan oiled lightly and drizzle oil on top. Great! Thanks for this one!

Yum, so good!  We really liked these.  I used the Garlic/Mushroom soup packet and added mushrooms also.  Some of the veggies were soft, but overall they were very good.  I cooked them for 45 minutes, so I would reduce that a little next time.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! Definately added a delicious change to the table. The first time I made it, I added everything in at once and my cauliflower and
broccoli turned really mushy and
dissappeared after stirring...even with that, it tasted sooooooo good.
 The second time, I baked onion,mushrooms, potato, lima beans and carrots for about 20-25 minutes(in an oven bag with the seasoning, oil and 
some garlic powder) and then added frozen broccoli and cauliflower. Put it back in the oven till all was done. Yum 
This recipe is a definate keeper

Awesome. I didn't use the whole package of soup mix and it still had plenty of flavor. I omitted to zucchini b/c I had none. Extra potatoes and carrots instead.

LOVE this! Definately cook the potates a bit first and the oven bag was a great tip.  I tried this for the first time last week and have already made it twice, trying different veggies and soup mixes- it's great anyway you mix it up!

A good way to create a quick variation on the usual baked vegetables. I chuck what ever vegetables are on hand in a baking bag and toss in the onion mix and iol. Shake the bag and stick it in the oven. No dishes! I use common sense as to judging the time each vege takes to cook and how big I cut the peices. eg, cut potato small and zuchinni larger. Never had a problem with over/undercooked veges.

This was one of the best vegetable recipes I've ever cooked. I will definately keep it!! I cooked it as is except I left out the potatoes, since I only needed this dish as a veggie dish. It truly was divine-even for my precious hubby who is not much of a veggie eater!

I thought this was great!  I don't usually cook with pre-packaged soup mixes but this was an easy way to season veggies:  no mixing, just sprinkle on and pop in the oven!  I think this might be my favorite way to eat cooked carrots.

I liked this recipe.  The veggies taste really flavourable.  However, they seemed to be a bit dry and not soft at all.  I used a convection oven and it only took me about 30 mins.  Maybe adding some water or chicken broth would help.  I would try this again!

I made this according to recipe. It lacks something to make it a 5 star.  I think maybe the chicken broth suggested by other reviewers might make a big difference.  I'll try that next time.

This wasn't bad, but it seems to need to be much more high maintenance than suggest.  I chopped the potatoes into very small pieces, & put them in 15 minutes earlier than the other vegetables.  I would recommend putting in the brocoli at a later time than other vegetables as they were rather wilted after 40 minutes.

At other reviewers suggestions, I cooked the potatoes for 15 minutes prior to adding in the rest of the veggies, then baked everything another 40 minutes -- perfect tenderness on everything, and a HUGE hit, even with my husband who isn't a vegie eater!

Delicious! I'm not a big vegetable eater, so I was looking for recipes with a lot of additional flavor and this dish certainly has it. I served them over Vermicelli with cut-up baked chicken breasts, and it made a beautiful presenatation. I agree with the other user about cokking the potatoes a few minutes by themselves first, because they were kind of undercooked. Great recipe! Thanks!

Wow! This is surprisingly good! It is very simple, but tastes like you spent a lot of time and energy preparing it. The vegetables are so tasty you could eat them alone, but they do taste great over some brown rice. The family loved the recipe.

Easy recipe and allows for easy variation. I made with carrots, broccoli, sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and mushrooms. The onion mix was a great flavor without being overwhelming. I added mushrooms when 15 mins left to bake. Husband and I had seconds and even our toddlers liked it. Will definitely make again!

Extremely easy and very good!  You can make it with just about any vegetables, and if you cut your root vegetables small enough, you don’t have to stagger the cooking time for the individual vegetables.  A keeper.

It was delicious.  I will be making again.  I also read the reviews and mixed the dry soup mix with oil and mixed veggies into it.  It coats the veggies evenly and gives such a wonderful flavor.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I used whatever vegetables I had on hand and followed the advice from the other reviewers and placed a portion of the onion mix and olive oil in a bag and tossed the potatoes and baked it first for about 15 minutes.  Then I tossed the remaining veggies with the remaining onion mix and olive oil and added them to the potatoes and baked for another 30-40 minutes.  The veggies were very flavorful and so easy to make.  I also didn't add any salt as the onion mix was flavorful enough.  Next time, I am going to try making my own onion mix so I can control the sodium content.

This recipe was a perfect guide. I played around with what I had, namely corn and mushrooms on top of the ones mentioned above! I used liquid chicken stock and powdered chicken stock to taste, the results were amazing!!! I recommend cooking the potatoes and corn, covered as suggested, before continuing with the rest, opened, and tossing around between ten minutes or so! Also, I added whole garlics because my partner loves his garlics that way.

I roast every vegetable that's roast-able. I toss them with olive oil, minced garlic and whatever spices that will enhance the rest of the menu--Italian, Greek, South of the Border, Asian. This is great riff on my go-to method. It's a quick, easy way to get a variety of flavors and any veg combination will do, but watch out for the salt content of those powdered soups.

I didn't have the mix so i checked here for a substitute for the mix and i had all the spices to make it, so i just made the mix from scratch. I put the carrots and potatoes in the oven for 10 minutes then added the rest of the vegetables for another 5 minutes. It was my first time to really cook and my boyfriend said he was really surprised at how much the vegetables tasted so good. I just paired it with filet mignon on the george foreman grill which was a no brainer so i'm happy with the recipe and i will use it again. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this recipe. MINOR changes.  Omitted zucchini and potatoes and added cauliflower, chunks of onions and fresh mushrooms..  Mixed everything in a zip lock bag first.  Done for me in 30 minutes.  DELICIOUS way to serve fresh veggies and NO leftovers.  Have made a few times and am making for Thanksgiving again this year.  Very pleasing presentation, too.  Nice color! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

I love this as a take-along side dish because it's so easy. I really use whatever vegetables I have, but I always omit the potatoes because of how long they take to soften. I particularly like broccoli, mushrooms, carrots (which are still firm), onion, zucchini and grape tomatoes.

Yum! Both my hubs and I enjoyed this served alongside Virginia C's spicy peach glazed pork chops. He picked around the zucchini and broccoli (he hates both), but I ate it all! My only criticism is that this makes enough to serve an army, even if you halve everything!!! Next time, I'll only use a few types of veggies - potatoes, carrots and either broccoli OR zucchini (and definitely no more than 2 zucchini), an entire packet of soup mix and salt to taste (you may think you can do without it, but it's really a must IMHO). NOTE: This takes much longer than 45 minutes to cook thru AND you definitely need to give your carrots and potatoes a head start. It took just over an hour for my potatoes and carrots to cook completely. All in all, this was very good but in need of a few minor tweaks to suit my tastes. Thanks for sharing, Klara! :)

Really good.  I made this as a side dish, so we had a lot of leftovers.  I put foil over mine to make it cook faster.  I also used homemade onion soup mix.  The store only had 2 zucchini left, so I substituted the other 2 with yellow squash.

I tried this tonight with overwhelming success!!!! It was way better than I expected! My husband wants me to make it again when his family comes to town for Christmas!  I used whatever I had in the house...broccoli, cauliflower, corn, frozen French fries (steak cut), Italian sausage slices (per-cooked), zucchini, mushrooms, sweet onion, and at the final five minutes sprinkled bacon bits and Parmesan cheese on top!! Wow! So good! The garlic and herb salad dressing/spice mix were the only spices I used. I used olive oil like the recipe suggests and added chicken broth like many reviewers suggested. This was our main course! I think I will use the leftovers in a scramble tomorrow for breakfast! Thanks for this recipe! I'm going to use it (or variations of it) often!!

This was delicious! I didn't have any onion soup mix so I just made one myself using dry beef bouillion, onion powder, onion flakes, pepper, garlic powder and a touch of sugar. I also added the broccoli during the last 15 minutes because I don't like it to get mushy. This is something I'll be making regularly.

Doubled the recipe thank goodness as I had 2 extra for dinner with a total of 11 people.  This went very well with the Rosemary-Scented Pork Loin Stuffed With Roasted Garlic, Dried Apricots and Cranberries and Port Wine Pan Sauce on this site.  The only change I made was son doesnt eat Zucchini so used green beans instead and next time will add the broccoli during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Everyone loved this dish had no left overs

these were probably the best side of veggies i've ever had! i used what i had on hand, which was 3 white potatoes, 3 carrots, and 1 large sweet onion cut into wedges. i followed the advise of another reviewer and cut the potatoes first then stuck it in a baking bag w/ 3T of the oil/onion soup mix for 15 min. cut up the rest of the veggies, threw those in the bag with the rest of the mix and baked for another 30 min. these paired very well with the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast also found on this site.

I didn't use the zucchini, instead I used bell pepper and it tasted delicious.  I also used an oven bag which helped blend the flavors without the mess.

This was pretty yummy. I made it in a roasting bag as another reviewer suggested.  All the veggies cooked up nice and tender.  Next time I'm going to switch up the veggies.  My husband would like me to make it next time with okra.

These were good for baked (I prefer something not so mushy) and certainly easy, which is awesome. I dumped a bags of frozen: seasoned chopped potatoes, a bag of cauliflower/broccoli, a bag of red/yellow peppers, and also a container of mushrooms into a large bowl (no thawing), and tossed it all with the oil and 2 pkg lipton onion soup. It doesn't get much easier and the mushrooms were SO good. hard to make them not mushy though, since I cooked them out at the brink of being cooked, the problem may be the potatoes (pre-cooked, so perhaps got overcooked).  I'll definitely try it again.

i really like to make this recipe for family get togethers.  it has a very good taste.  i always get compliments on it.  i personally like my vegetables steamed and a little crunchy, but when you need to satisfy a variety of people, young and old...this is a wonderful recipe!!

Very tasty and filling. The olive oil soaks into the potatoes to make them gooey and delicious. I'm thinking of using real onions in it next time, and maybe some cubed pumpkin?

A satisfying vegetable dish that I'm sure kids will love, but it's nothing spectacular.  I cooked the potatoes at a low boil while I chopped the rest of the veggies.  I added some cauliflower as well.  I chose a Knorr "Cream of Fine Herbs" soup mix and used half of the 47 gram package.  The only disappointment was the zucchini- they came out too liquidy and fell apart when I took them out of the dish.  The broccoli and cauliflower were great.

Yummy.  This is a good base recipe. I used Golden Onion soup (it was all i had). I used potatoes, sweet potatoes & baby carrots. Delicious combo! Will be making this often.

Very good baked vegetables. I used red potatoes and all of the vegetables that were called for. Instead of Onion Lipton Soup I used the Savory Herb & Garlic Soup that many reviewers suggested. This was a great way to introduce more vegetables to your diet.  When I make it again I will definitely add even more veggies! Thanks Klara.

My whole family loved this dish.  I did have to cook it for about an hour to get the potatoes and carrots tender, but I will definitely make this again.  I also covered it after about 40 minutes because the broccoli started to burn.  I would like to experiment by adding different vegies.  Great recipe!

This recipe was excellent -- veggies came out tender and seasoned like from a restaurant.  I had to cook it for quite a while longer than indicate here though; just kept checking it until the potatoes were tender.

Great way to eat veggies. I omitted the potatoes, and used onions, peppers, zucchini, eggplant, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and carrots and between my husband and myself we polished off 4 servings.

I will make this recipe again and again.  I can't think of an easier way to prepare vegetables.  I also a variety of vegetables (other than what the recipe called for) and it still turned out great.  Also used the olive oil that is flavored with different spices and flavors and it added even more flavor to the dish.

Hmmm.  My husband enjoyed this.  I did not.  My potatoes stuck to the pan, even with the oil on the pan.  Maybe a non-stick spray would work better?  The vegetables were soggy.  I would have liked them to be a little more crisp.  I will make this again, but not cook it as long.  I did what another reviewer did and added yellow squash (in place of two of the zucchini).  It is a colorful dish.  I gave it 3 stars for "kid friendly" only because my son won't eat potatoes and cooked carrots.  He pushed them aside but ate the rest.  This would be a good dish to take to a BBQ.  Make it/bake it in a disposable pan and you're there!

Love it!  Didn't quite follow the recipe - didn't use potatoes at all and used a grill seasoning mix instead of dry soup podwer - but it turned out sweet (!) and great.  Especially complimentary to the chicken a la king which turned out a little salty.  Lots of room for experimentation.

Quick, easy and pretty as a side dish... but I would suggest cooking it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for if you like your potatoes soft (like my husband does.) Otherwise, this one's a winner.

I used only potatoes and zucchini.  The soup mix was really strong and the vegies were dry, BUT someone suggested that I bake it covered to add moisture and help the vegies cook faster.  I'll try that next time.

This tastes so much more delicious than the recipe makes out, with its incredible simplicity and "lack" of flavoring ingredients. I substituted cauliflower for broccoli, and it was excellent.

I added a large ripe chopped Roma tomatoe, 2 large chopped cloves garlic and some dry oregano to this recipe.  I cooked it in a large covered casserole for about 40 min.  Very tasty and a good way to have a veggie meal.  Can't rate it for kids - mine are grown and gone!

This recipe didn't turn out too good.  I liked the idea of throwing the veggies together and sticking in the oven, but it just wasn't tasty.  I will continue to work with it though.

Mixed review.  I did not like this recipe as it was a bit to salty for my liking.  But the rest of my family thought it was the best and requested that I make it again.

I enjoyed this recipe after I got the hang of it.  I found the directions somewhat ambiguous.  By trial and error, I found it is important to use a rather shallow baking dish.  I used a deeper, casserole-type dish on my first try, and the vegetables near the outside of the dish burned while those on the inside were raw.  It is a tasty way to serve vegetables, though!

5 Star Veggies! Per other reviewers suggestions, I cooked the potatoes first for 10 minutes, then added the rest of the vegetables. The onion soup mix gives it a wonderful flavor!

Easy way to make a whole pile of veggies - the onion soup adds lots of flavour.  I was already making mashed potatoes, so I added broccoli and cauliflower.  Took a while to cut everything up, but after that, you just plop it in the oven and presto!

I served this recipe at my Daughters Birthday party (mostly adults) and every one raved about it!  Cutting up all the veggies can be a bit time consuming but then you throw it into the oven and forget about till it's done.  I've made this quite a few times...I added some other veggies that were on the list, and threw in some potatoe chunks the one time...still wonderful!

Very good way to enjoy veggies. I love zucchinies...so this was great. I think I will try other suggestions such as adding mushrooms. I served this with Fish In a Vegetable Patch and Jasmine Rice. Because there is two of us, we cut the recipe in half...It was very good, so we practically finished it.

This is a great way to fix flavorful veggies...I hate to cut up veggies, tho, which is why I gave it only a 3 for quickness ;o)  Using pre-cut veggies is certainly an alternative, but wouldn't be as fresh.

This is a great way to serve your family veggies and is now one of my favorites.  I will use a little less oil next time, though.

I made this for my husband and kids for a special family dinner.
They just loved it.

My husband cleaned out the dish with absolutely nothing left.
