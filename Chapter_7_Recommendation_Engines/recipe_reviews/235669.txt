These were nice cupcakes! Loved the flavor combo of adding white chocolate chips!  This recipe made a HUGE batch, so I did 12 cupcakes and then used the rest in a bread loaf pan. It was perfect! Great way to really spruce up a box mix!

Made this last night for our New Year's celebration with a few revisions. First I used Yellow cake mix instead of white because I had it on hand. Also used mini semi sweet chocolate chips instead of white, again because I had on hand. Instead of making as cupcakes I made a bundt cake instead. Took about 42 minutes to cook. Instead of canned frosting I made a lowfat cream cheese frosting and drizzled it on top. This was super moist and very delicious. I like that it used egg whites and had no added sugar into the recipe as many others did that were similar. I try to keep my cooking on the lighter/lowfat side. Because of the pumpkin you could probably do without adding the oil. I may try that next time.

Made them exactly to the recipe. They were super moist with a great flavor. Will definitely keep this in the holiday treat rotation!
