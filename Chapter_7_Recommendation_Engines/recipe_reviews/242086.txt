I made these as the recipe states and they turned out great. I made them for my 14 month old, and he devoured them! What he didn't know is that while he was eating his peas, I was hiding in the kitchen eating the leftover sweet potato fries! Don't worry buddy, mommy will be making more, for the both of us!

Delicious!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked them at 400 degrees and checked them after 10 minutes and flipped them over for 10 more.  Added rosemary for a little extra spice.

The oven temperature was too high, one side burned at 20 minutes, and the potatoes were cooked at that point.

These were good. Not crispy, but I can never get a good crisp on sweet potatoes in the oven. I added more spices to our taste

Very delicious! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside! I baked them at 200 degrees C for 20 minutes stirring halfway through and they turned out great! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Wish I had read some of the reviews first. Recipe needs to be changed. They were pretty burned at 20 minutes

Loved this dish. I admit that I made some adjustments for ingredients I did not have on hand. My changes: no vanilla bean so I used olive oil spray on the potatoes and apples. Sprinkled with Mexican vanilla and the other spices. (Minus the ginger-didn’t have any). I tossed these well and then into the oven. 10 minutes wasn’t enough. I did 20 with the last few minutes on broil. Definitely will do this again!

I made these but only with Pam Olive Oil spray and pink Himalayan salt because I’m in a strict diet. I didn’t need to cook them so long so they were a tad “well done” but still good!

The temp is way too high!!  Could I cook them at 350 or for a shorter time than 20 min??

Most of mine burned at the 20 min mark and I had even turned it down to 375; it's hard for me to bake at 450 as I believe it is way to high.

Thanksm!!

I tossed the sweet potatoes in a little bit of maple syrup as well.  They don't crisp up much, but they tasted very good!

I'd shorten the cooking time to 30 min.  I took them out at 33 min and several were burnt.  I'd cook the second half for 10 min and watch carefully for an additional time.

The first time I made this I used olive oil as the recipe calls for, and my smoke alarm went off.  Apparently the smoke point of olive oil is 405°F.  The next time I used peanut oil (smoke point of 450°F) and had no problems.  However, I did have lots of charred pieces.  Next time I will take the advice of many of these reviewers and bake at 400°F for 10 minutes on one side, then 10 minutes more after flipping, and see how they turned out.  The unburned pieces were very good!

Not so nuts about this one, sorry, I'm not what you would call a sweet potato fan.
They didn't come out as crisp as I wanted and the ones that did were burned on the ends.  HOWEVER: may have been my old oven  which caused the issue.

Came out crispy yet soft inside.  Despite my wood cook stove's temperature fluctuation, the potatoes still cooked in good time.... pleasing my husband immensely.  Will follow this recipe every time! Thanks.
