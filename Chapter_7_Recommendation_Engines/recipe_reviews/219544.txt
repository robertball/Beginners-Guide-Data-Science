The "Swanson Flavor Boost" is a gel consistency, not a powder or liquid, and is an EXCELLENT product...I work part time for a sales and marketing company and I have sampled this product twice and sold out of it at both stores...I highly recommend this product...it is available in chicken, low sodium chicken, vegetable and beef.
 Very delicious and versatile product! Try it, you'll love it!
You are only limited by your own imagination!  :)

Moist flavorful chicken breasts.  Used sweet basil (no thyme), used Swanson's chicken broth (no powdered) and simmered longer to reduce.

I loved this recipe. I cooked fresh sliced mushrooms with the shallots. I didn't have the Swanson broth so I used chicken stock. I added a little corn starch to thicken the broth and white wine sauce and served it with rice pilaf.  Fast, easy meal.

This is now on my frequently used recipes list. We LOVE it!  I love it because it's so ridiculously easy to make.  I was looking for a white wine sauce that would be easy and this fits the bill in the most delicious way possible.  

My husband loves it as well. He likes the sauce over mashed potatoes which is weird cause it's not gravy but it's actually pretty good that way.  

It took a bit to find the Flavor Boost stuff but it's required as it adds lots of flavor with little liquid. I use green onion rather than scallions and add them at the last second.

I only had dried thyme on hand, but this still turned out great! Very easy to make and great flavor.

Made this tonight. Overlooked my chicken, as I had huge boneless, skinless breasts, however it was still delish. Served with thin spaghetti and broccoli. Will certainly make again. Quick and easy

Not good at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was waaaayyyy too salty to eat and the chicken was bland and tasteless.  I will not be making this again, with or without alterations.

A similar recipe is a family favorite.  Flour chicken pieces and brown in margarine or butter.  Pour on low sodium chicken broth (homemade if u have it)  and white wine. Add to taste dry fines herbs, parsley, and garlic powder. Simmer til cooked. Never tried the shallots but probably wouldn't hurt it.

Delicious!! I made this for my son who loves Macaroni Grill's chicken in white wine sauce. He loved this recipe. I used the Knorr reduced stock and I found that I should have made sure it was completely dissolved and blended with the sauce before I put the chicken breast back in. Otherwise we really like this. We'll make it again.

A really good, easy recipe!  I used dried thyme - what I had on hand - and it was excellent.  DH wants me to double the sauce next time so we have extra on hand for . . . sopping?

Loved this, but I can't leave well enough alone.  My variations:
1.  Fresh thyme bundle, chopped fresh oregano, 2 bay leaves, and 2 garlic cloves as my flavor base
2.  Reduced Sodium Better than Bullion so I could control the salt content
3.  Dredged raw chicken in flour, onion powder, pepper, light salt to give it a nice browning when it cooked
4.  Finished sauce with some unsalted butter - cuts the acid of the wine and smooths out the sauce
5.  Threw in angel hair pasta and miscellaneous cooked veggies at the end (I just thawed some frozen faves).  I also stretched the sauce a bit with some pasta water.

These little flourishes did not really add much time to the cooking and they resulted in a really nice dish.

So I did not have shallots or thyme--fresh or dried.  I used Italian seasoning (ground in my palm) and garlic and onion powders instead.  I only made two chicken breasts, but made the whole of the sauce.  I only had maybe a third of the sauce left over, though I may have reduced it too much while waiting for my rice.  I DID have the concentrated broth though, which I am sure added a TON of flavor!  I did find it a bit salty, but I kind of like that sometimes.   My husband was very pleased with this as well, and it is now in our book.

This is a nice recipe . I didn't have any flavour boost so I used about a half  box of Campbells Stock First , had to let it simmer longer . But I think that was a good thing , the chicken took on even more flavour . Only other changes I used dried thyme and used 2 shallots ( 1 I put in with the chicken while it browned up ). Of course I added salt & pepper  . This is a great recipe because it would change to whatever type of wine you used . Might even try this with some rosemary added to it .Served with mashed potatoes & string beans . The only thing I would say to people who don't like the taste of wine you might want to try another recipe . Or maybe use chicken stock instead of wine .

This was a really awesome recipe! I used a tsp. of dried thyme because that's what I had, but it was still great and really easy to make! :-)
