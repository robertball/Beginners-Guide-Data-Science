yummm!!! I really like this fall themed recipe. I live in Germany so apples and sausage is in no short suppy and am always looking for delicious recipes that include both of them. Anyways I made a few little changes I cooked the sausages in beer and then cut them lengthways and turned the heat up high which allows the beer to carmelize and crisps the outside of the sausages. I did the apple onion mixture as directed and served it on top of some mashed potatoes with the sausages on the very top. So so so so good!!

I really enjoyed this but I made a few alterations. I used sweet italian sausages, granny smith apples, red wine vinegar & I was out of brown sugar so I used 5 tbp. red wine vinegar, 5 tbp. sugar & 1 tbp. molasses. I broiled the sausages & then sliced them on a diagonal & added them to the apple & onion mixture for a couple of minutes to coat w/ the sauce. Very good! The flavor of the sauce w/ the sausages meshed together very well. Next time I will double the onions though because they were that good. :o)

I have made this two times. The first time I used bangers and followed the recipe except I split open the sausages before placing them under the broiler. I liked it alot but my husband thought it was too appley. The SECOND time I made it I used brats and 3/4 of the reccommended apples. I boiled the brats in dark beer instead of water and split them in half before placing them under the broiler. My husband loved it this time and the I liked that the brats had so much more flavor than the bangers. A very good German style dish!! Thanks for submitting it!!

A bit vinegar-y for my taste but good. I will add less vinegar next time but I will make again.

Hubbie and I thought this was yummy. I used pre-cooked kielbasa so skipped the boiling and just added it sliced up into the apple/onion mixture after it caramalized.

I thought this was delicious. My husband thought the apples tasted "funny". I'll give it a 4 as an average score. I used a chicken and apple sausage for the dish I also think the apple and onion would go great with pork chops! Be sure to cook the onion and apple mixture at a high enough heat that it caramelizes rather than just boils down. I think mashed potatoes would be a good side with this.

This was so tasty. I was looking for a quick supper and a little something different...did a search for sausages (because that's what I had out of the freezer) and what a pleasant surprise. We really enjoyed this recipe and will make again often. A perfect little weeknight fall supper.

I used a mix of mild and hot Italian sausages because that is what I had on hand; also used honeycrisp apples. I scaled the recipe down to 4 sausages 1 onion & 3 small apples but used the full amount of butter/vinegar/brown sugar. What that saute sauce does to the onions and apples is really good bringing out the best in those honeycrisps! My DH is a big fan of sausages and I'm not; but we both enjoyed this meal. Served it with Pan-Fried Asparagus and Cornmeal Muffins I from this website. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Jayda!

This recipe was good but not exceptional. I used smoked apple sausage that was pre-cooked so I skipped the boiling step and grilled them on my George Foreman. The apple/onion mixture was good but I would have liked more of a sauce. I put the mixture into some hoagie rolls and it turned out pretty good. I'd definitely make this again but will figure out a way to make more of a sauce next time.

I used breakfast sausages because thats what I had on hand and thought this was really really yummy! We had it for dinner but would make a nice brunch dish too. I thought it was sweet enough and wouldn't add additional sugar as has been suggested - maybe that's just me though.

I'd give this 5 stars but my hubby was only fairly impressed so I gave it 4. I used Italian sausage (for some spice) and sliced it after broiling and added directly to the apples/onions and simmered so the sausage picked up the other flavors. Being of Germanic heritage this recipe reminded me of traditional German cooking! The apples and onion really came together with all the other flavors! With all the different tastes going on it's a "busy" flavor - a symphony of tastes... maybe too busy for my hubby's pallet but I LOVED it!

I cooked the sausage in a skillet removed it cooked the onions and apples and put everything together in the end. It was good but not spectacular. I'll make it again although it lacks a wow factor because it tastes good and is quick to make.

I browned the sausage onions and apples added about 1/2 C. beer and cooked down. I put this on top of some mashed baby potatoes. It turned out really good.

I'm not a big fan of cooked apples but this recipe was outstanding! I used pink lady apples and apple cider vinegar along with a beef sausage I cooked on the grill. I didn't boil it first just cooked it on the grill. Excellent!

Super!!! My only changes were to cook the sausages(chicken andoiulle)in a pan with some dark beer and water and then slice them into pieces before adding them to the onions and apples.

I did a search for meal recipes with sausages and this one came up. I also happened to have the other ingredients and decided to try it. I can't say I have really eaten anything that tasted quite like this. The sausages are cooked as any sausage might be but the onion apple combination was very different. I expected more of a sweet apple taste but instead it is more of a vinegar onion taste with just a hint of sweetness. I made mashed potatoes but the apple and onion mixture didn't really work as a subtitute for gravy to go on top. So the potatoes were served on the side but gave a nice balance to the vinegar onion and apple mixture. This seems like a dish that might be served at a German restaurant in my opinnion. One reviewer said to eat this dish with good beer and I think that may just be the compliment.

I make something similar all the time- my husband can never get enough.  I use real maple syrup in place of the sugar, and I like to add a dash of beer or white wine if we have it around. Works great with chicken andouille sausages!

SO GOOD! I used sweet Italian sausage and gala apples and it was just wonderful. The apples and sausage complimented each other perfectly. The vinegar and brown sugar combined to make a wonderful glaze.

Sweet very sweet. I'm the only one in my family of 5 that ate this. Even my husband who'll eat anything only picked out the sausage to eat. It's really sweet & the vinegar leaves an aftertaste. It's good tho(to me:) but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

I'm always on the lookout for quick dishes to make on workdays that aren't boring. This definitely makes the list. I used herbed sausages and cooked them under the broiler I also used red wine vinegar. I would maybe add in another onion next time. Really enjoyed this. Thanks.

great recipe! so easy and very tasty. ive made this many times when i dont have time. minimal easy access recipe easy cooking and Great tasting way to jazz up plain sausages. i noticed one thing: in step 2 it says to poke the sausages Then boil them - this leaks out all the jiuce and sausages come out quite dry. i suggest boiling them without poking holes- halfway through cut the middle with a knife to check readi-ness and continue cooking as driected: (please disregard my rating)

Delicious anmd simple! I only used 1 1/2 onions and 2 apples and there was still tons! I used red wine vinegar and I also added one more tbsp of the vinegar because my boyfriend doesn't like sweet flavor with his meats. He was sceptical but in the end He loved this recipe.

I thought this was a wonderful easy recipe! I made it last night for dinner with some red apples I had gotten from the farmer s market. I also used smoked sausage (halved and cut into links then browned in a skillet over medium heat). I used one large onion instead of the two medium onions the recipe called for. I also had apple cider vinegar on hand that I used in place of the apple cider/ red wine vinegar. It turned out perfect! I served it with the Oven Roasted Potatoes from this site and a nice dark beer. My husband was also pleased with the meal. I will definitely make this again throughout the fall season.

Pretty good a different way to cook sausage. It has similar tastes to german potato salad maybe because I used apple cider vinegar.

This was unusual and good! I served it over mashed potatoes and they went really well together. I thought it needed a little more vinegar and I also wouldn't have used as much sugar in it. Don't be afraid to leave the onions in there a LONG time-it really adds to the flavor that may otherwise be a bit bland. And drink a beer with it preferably a porter or a stout!

An interesting mix of ingredients that makes a nice filling fall dish. I used beef smoke sausage and since it was already cooked I didn't boil it but just cut it up lengthwise and cooked it w/ the onions and apples. Equally after it began to carmelize I added some chorizo sausage which added a nice flavor. Next time we plan to use hot or cajun sausage instead of beef smoke sausage as this would add just the right flavor to this dish. We are giving it 3-stars since it wasn't the best sausage dish we ever had but yet it wasn't bad.

This was really good! I oven broiled spicy chicken sausage and used thinly sliced Bermuda onions - other than that I followed the recipe as written. I recommend Granny Smith apples only because they hold their shape better and don't become too mushy. The spicy and the sweet flavors contrasted nicely and I will definitely be making this again! Thanks...

Good combination. I used apples from our own tree which are really tart and still a little crunchy after cooking that long. I also added about a 1/4 tsp of ground cloves and a little bit more ground sage with the apples. Now I'm going to try to adapt the recipe to the oven so I can feed 30.

I used Granny Smith apples in this recipe. After I was halfway into this recipe I realized I was out of apple cider vinegar but I did have apple juice--I just used apple juice instead of apple cider vinegar. My family loved these. NO leftovers.

I think that the success of the super-sweet onions is to have a spicy sausage. And served over wild rice it's great! I just sauteed bulk sausage then set it aside while I carmelized the onion in the pan fat.

Delish! Both my husband and I loved it - kids wouldn't touch the onion/apple mixture but they ate the meat and liked it. I had to substitute red wine vinegar because I was out of cider vinegar but it was still good. One note: I used apples rather past their prime (waste not want not and all that sort of thing!) and they turned to mush. It wasn't like applesauce but I think it would've been better texture-wise to have firmer apples. Oh and I used Beef Brats but next time I'll use the real ones - tasted a little like a hot dog! So this goes in the recipe box and I'll definitely make this again - with the right ingredients!

Wonderful flavors and very fall-ish! Was looking for something quick and easy... and different... so fruit for dinner struck me!! I used kielbasa from Sam's... I don't know the brand but it is one we go back to repeatedly as it is a little sweet... used full 3 pound package...3 large granny smith apples reduced the onion to 1 (just because I knew my kids would gripe if they saw too many) and then rather than using regular brown sugar used 1 TBSP of brown sugar substitute (like sweet & lo). The flavors melded perfectly (and I am someone who has never been fond of pork & apples). I'm really glad I tried this...the granny smiths cooked up nicely...was not too soggy grainy or sweet! Just perfect for us! A keeper!

This was a great recipe. I made a few alterations. I fried the sausage in a separate pan with apple cider. I then cut it in diagonals and added it to the onion and apple mix. I also added molasses and extra cider to the combined dish and cooked for a couple extra minutes. Delicious. Thank you!

I changed this a little by adding some tomato paste and water to create more of a sauce. I ended up slicing the sausages (after cooking them through) and tossing them through the apple mixture before serving. Great tasting dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Love the flavors of apple onion and bratwurst combined! I simmered the bratwurst then sliced and browned in butter separately. I think thyme is wonderful with the caramelized onions and apples...

This dinner had way more flavor than what I expected. I made this as written using the apple cider vinegar and grilling my non-pierced sausages. The onions caramelized nicely and the apples added a nice sweetness to the entire recipe. My family really enjoyed this meal that I served with a simple lettuce salad and fresh bread.

Very good flavors. I used pulled pork that I cooked in the crock pot for my meat but I used the apples and onions to go on top. Very tasty! Will make again thanks for the recipe Jayda!

REALLY good! I made this with Bangers instead of brats. I'm not a fan of sausage but the apples & onions were a wonderful addition. It would also be good on a pork chop.

I was looking for something to make with bratwurst without potatoes and found this recipe with this curious apple and onion combination that sounded so different but possibly delicious and it really was! So simple and so tasty...slightly sweet and balanced flavors when seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. I used equal parts onions and apples which turned out to be two medium onions and 2 large honey crisp apples. You could easily add another apple. I added some fresh tarragon I had growing but it tasted great without it too. I pan browned the brats on the stove so I could tend to the onions and apples at the same time. It pairs wonderfully with a bold beer for Octoberfest... I had a homebrewed double IPA. Definitely a keeper!

I too found this a very good dish but not out of this world. I think doubling the brown sugar and vinegar would be better. It was a nice change having the apples in there and the combination of flavours was good. I will definitely make this again. A nice autumn dish.

I made this last fall after going apple picking. It was fantastic. It became an autumnal staple. I've been waiting all year for the weather to get cool enough to try it again. Perfect fall food. Especially good served with steamed cabbage and warm pumpernickel.

This dish was the hit of my party. I was generous with the black pepper. I used soft golden delicious apples so I didn't cook them quite as long as I would have a crisper apple. I boiled then broiled an inexpensive smoked sausage and cut them in to pieces. So easy to make. I will make this again!

I chose chicken feta and spinach sausages which I boiled briefly in beer and then finished them under the broiler. I used a cast iron skillet to caramelize the onion in butter before adding a thinly sliced Granny Smith Apple apple cider vinegar and brown sugar. Seasoned mixture with salt and freshly ground black pepper. I served this with Guldens Spicy Brown Mustard on potato hot dog rolls. Really great flavour! Both my husband and teenage son really liked this dish. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night and WOW was it good!! My husband and daughter also really enjoyed it. I used Turkey Sausage (sweet italian style). My husband described it as "different"--in a good way. I used the cider vinegar. Thanks for sharing this recipe--we have 13 pounds of apples to eat after a trip to the orchard last weekend. There are only 3 of us here so it's good to have different ways to use them up.

Quite delicious! I used 3 sausages (about 1 lb) and still made a full recipe of apples/onions and I'm glad I did as they were yummy. I got an apple chicken sausage from the butcher at Whole Foods and it was perfect for this meal. We went apple picking this weekend and I was looking for recipes to use up apples and I'm glad I found this one! Thanks!

Yummy! We really enjoyed this dish. My fiance says six stars. I used pre-cooked Johnsonville smoked turkey sausage so I cooked the onions and apples according to the recipe then added the heated diagonally-sliced sausage to the skillet a minute or two before serving. Other sausages may have been better in this dish but we have to watch cholesterol. The recipe doesn't give a weight - or even type - for the sausages; I used six sausages (one package) total weight about fourteen ounces. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick easy super delicious. I really needed to use up some apples and did this in a lazy do-it-myself kind of way. I didn't follow this recipe but copied the idea (I had google searched "what to do with sausages and apples) and ended up doing the exact same thing anyways... Took butter purple onions (its what I had what can I say) sliced up apples S&P brown sugar put them in a pan caramelized them together. Meanwhile the sausages (mild italian) pre-cooked a bit in the oven. took the sausages out the oven sliced them up put them in the pan and then ate it all with boiled potatoes and white wine. bam. fantastic dinner.

Wonderful! I halved the onions & apples and kept the sauce the same and it was fantastic. As one person suggested I cooked the sausage (italian) in dark beer but not sure if it made a difference or not. I served this with mashed potatoes (made with potatoes 1 C. sour cream and 8 oz onion/chive cream cheese). Fantastic easy meal.

The apples and onions were so good. I followed Imvintage's advice and it worked very well. I used turkey sausages which had a wierd texture and the flavor wasn't that great either. Next time I will use a better sausage. I really loved the apples/onions. I cut the recipe down to 3 sausages and used one red onion and one large Honeycrisp apple and one small mystery apple (from a neighbor's tree lol).

I used the regular smoked sausage in the store because I was short on time and it was on sale and went ahead and just broiled it...yum! Holy smokes it was great! I like my sausage a bit almost burnt so the combo of that little bit of crunch plus sticky of the apples and onions...it was great. It was easy it's FAST and my guests loved it. I served it with fresh bread and side salads to make it a bit more summery instead of autumnal. Moochas smoochas for this recipe!

I made this for my family tonight and it was definitely a hit. I was worried about the onions being too overpowering so I added extra brown sugar and red wine vinegar. I also added vegetable oil into the saucepan with the onions with the butter. All of these resulted in a slightly liquid base but the taste was incredible. Will definitely make it again!

This was really good - but relies heavily on using a really tasty sausage. We used turkey sausage and I feel like it would be better with pork. The apples/onions were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly using apple cider vinegar and everyone enjoyed the end result.

I needed some kind of accompaniment for the plain chicken breast I was planning to serve for supper and have bushels of apples and onions to use. What a good recipe to make up as a side for the chicken! I made no changes except to omit the sausage. I wasn't looking for a sausage recipe anyway just a way to use up apples and onions.

I used apple/maple chicken sausages to go with this recipe but I felt that the whole meal was slightly flavorless maybe because of the sausages. Next time I'll try it with sweet italian sausages instead.

This was good but not incredible. We enjoyed it though. The taste was fairly mild and I couldn't even taste the onions once I was done cooking them.

I just made the apple & onion portion of this to top some pork chops. It was not what I expected. Maybe meant better for sausages.

My family and I really enjoyed this great fall dish. I used sweet itlian sausage like another reviewer though I think a spicy sausage would taste great against the sweetness of the apples. I forgot to peel my apples (granny smiths) but it didn't really make a difference so if you want to save a little bit of time I wouldn't worry to much about that step!

I liked this meal but gave it a 4 seemed to be missing flavor. I will try it with the beer next time.

I used apple juice in place of the vinegar...I also cooked the appels and onions over med-high heat to carmelize better. The outcome was fantastic! A sticky delicious treat. I topped it onto a wheat bun and the entire family enjoyed it even my three year old.

Very good. I used pre-cooked sausage and added it to the apple/onion mixture the last 2 minutes to coat in sauce. My husband said it's 'excellent'.

I thought this recipe was very easy and a delicious way to use up those excess apples. I was out of brown sugar & used white instead & it was still great! Thanks for the recipe. I am going to make this again!

My husband and I both loved it. I only had chicken Italian sausage and added a little liquid smoke and used balsalmic vinegar since I was out of the others but I thought the flavors were divine.

I LOVED this flavor combination. I used a basil/garlic sausage which added more flavor and the apples and onions turned out beautifully. Thanks so much; I will make this again!

Delicious and easy! The only change that I made was to put the sausage on top of the apple/onion mixture and allow the sausage to steam along with the mixture. We will definitely be having this again.
