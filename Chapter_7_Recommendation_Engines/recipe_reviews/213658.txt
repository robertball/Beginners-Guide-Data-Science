This was really good.  I followed the recipe as written, but after it was done I tasted it and it needed something else.  So I squeezed some lemon juice and lemon pepper seasoning.   Next time I will also double or triple the amount of Almonds.

This was incredible easy to make!  I found that using the non-stick type of foil was best to keep the honeyed almonds from sticking to the foil.  This had a delightful flavour, but I would suggest adding about a teaspoon of grapeseed oil, to the dish.

Tasty, but I felt that the amount of honeyed nuts is not enough to add crunch and flavour to the couscous. That being said, we used the zest of one whole lemon and a combination of whole almonds and cashews chopped up. I think a touch (1/4 teaspoon maybe) of lemon pepper might give it some "zing" too. Served this with Rachael Ray's "Grilled Wasabi-Honey Shrimp".

I made this for my family last night to go with broiled fish. It was light and citrusy and the almonds added a nice crunch and some sweetness. My 18 month old daughter LOVED it and also ate all of my almonds. So, next time, more almonds. I am also thinking this might work well with quinoa.

I followed the recipe as instructed and the directions are so poor that my review had to reflect that. First, when I put the honeyed almonds on the foil, they just stuck.  I would recommend putting some spray on the foil first.

Easy and very tasty.  Do not be afraid to add more lemon zest.

I liked all of the components together, but I find the dish to be too bland and underseasoned.

Didn't have slivered almonds so I just crushed up whole ones. This recipe would make for a great breakfast in my opinion!
