Really good recipe and very budget friendly! My husband even went back for seconds. The only change I made was to add 1 tsp chili powder and a pinch of garlic powder. I also used regular rice, not instant.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was very good.  The only change I made was to add garlic powder and basil.(personal preference)  The only recommendation I have is to add a little bit more salt and pepper.  It was a little bland but could easily be adjusted to taste at the dinner table.  My 17 month old could not get enough of this.  Not only did he eat his but then he ate some of his Daddy's too.  The only one who wasn't impressed was my picky 3-1/2 year old but he has been difficult to please lately so I didn't take that as an insult.  My husband absolutely loved it and he is hard to please when it comes to meals that have rice.  This kind of tastes like a one-pan stuffed peppers.  Thank you Bernice for this quick easy and delicious meal!  We will definitely be adding this into our monthly rotation.

Loved it! Easy and quick and cheap to make.  I used exact amounts except I did not have any corn, so I left it out. We are big ketsup fans, so we loved the flavor. Will definitely make again!

We really like this!  One thing I've found is that I have to decrease the amount of salt to 1/2 teaspoon because otherwise it is SO salty!

Spot on! Just finished cooking this for my family and I taste tested it and it was delicious. I did use about half the sugar (I used splenda) and half the salt and I added a can of mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Will be serving this with peas and a salad for an excellent weeknight meal, thanks so much!

Fantastic! My 4 year old is super picky, but she gobbled this up! I used instant brown rice, turned out great. Quick, easy, delicious recipe. Thanks!

I made this to be a quick and cheap dinner.  I didn't expect something 5 star.  It was easy and cheap and pretty good.  I would make it again.  It's nothing that would make my families list of favorite meals, but I didn't expect it to.  I doubled the recipe to have enough for 2 nights for my family, and I used ground turkey for the meat.

Good mid-week supper recipe. It's also good for little ones with cooler tastebuds. I did like another reviewer and added some chili powder and garlic, even threw in some red pepper flake (just a smidge)for some punch.

Really great recipe!  I subtitute hot breakfast sausage in the chub roll, chicken broth for the water, and sometimes a can of RoTel.  I also add minced garlic.

This was quick and easy and we really enjoyed it. I had it with corn and crusty bread on the side. This recipe is budget friendly too.

This was so tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used long grain rice instead of instant.  I found that with this change, I needed about a total of 1.5 cups of water (I gradually added more water as it needed it).  I would suggest using a lean ground beef for this recipe because you don't drain off the fat because you brown the rice with the meat.  A new family favorite!

I added garlic powder.  I would tell you how much, but I don't measure.. Just dump! :)  Good - quick and easy!  Hot sauce would be a good add if you want some extra spice!

I made this last week without the ground beef as a spanish rice side dish and this actually worked well. I did add a 1/2 recipe of the Taco Seasoning I found at this site and skipped the salt and sugar.

This was OK.  Scores high points because it's easy and economical...I had dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, so that's great.  Taste-wise I thought it was boring and a tad bland...perhaps some chili powder, hot sauce or cayenne pepper would help.  I ended up topping it with grated parmesan cheese to make it more palatable.  I may make this dish again if I'm in another time crunch but I certainly wouldn't serve it to dinner guests.

My 2nd review. I used 1lb of beef 2 cups of rice cooked in the rice cooker I added some fresh and a can of diced tomatoes added garlic and some spices. I used an orange pepper instead of a green than I stuffed it into green peppers and baked and top with a tomato sauce/ketchup or cheese. typically I have some left overs by doubling the portion and than eat it right out of the bowel for lunch the next day.

YUM!  I wasn't sure my picky eaters would like this, but they did!!  The only thing I did different was use pureed tomatoes instead of sauce, skipped the green peppers and used cumin and a little garlic powder.  I will make this again.

my husband is a big fan of spanish rice and loved this recipe. first time i made it as written and was very good. the second time i added a small can of V8 juice and a can of stewed tomatoes which i had run through the food processer along with some tomato sauce and the water...this was exceptional..just gave it a little more peppery flavor. i have been looking for a recipe for spanish rice that was similar to one a neighbor made years ago and this is it. thanks bernice!

This was awesome! My picky husband and kids, 1 and 2, loved this. My 2 year old ate his plate, plus half my husbands and mine! My husband and I agreed it needs taco shells or tortillas.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty.  I made it just as directed for this first try, then I may play with the seasonings a bit next time.  The kids were afraid of the peppers, but when I picked them out they liked the flavor of the rest of it.  Maybe if I chop them up super small they won't notice next time.  Nothing sensational, just a quick and easy dinner with some canned fruit on the side.

I have our own version of this that we love. using either hamburger or steak-ums sliced in strips. Stir fry onion, bell pepper then add meat, next add taco seasoning pack and a small can of salsa, with a squeeze of lime and cilantro. Now add enough water to cook rice ( I use Uncle Ben's) and cook till rice is done.  We love this.

My family enjoyed the recipe.  I used regular rice already made and substituted chili powder and garlic powder for the mustard, as another reviewer did.  Will definitely make again.
