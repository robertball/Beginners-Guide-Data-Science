I made these brownies and followed the recipe exactly. It stated to whisk pudding for 2 min. I followed this instruction, and my pudding thickend. There was no pudding in the holes that were poked int the brownies. Not very good. Will not   make these again

Very easy to make, and went over huge at a Halloween party. I made them in cupcake cups and used cheesecake-flavored pudding. If you use the cupcake papers though, only use a little bit of brownie batter in each one, no more than a third full. Also, you might want to consider doubling the pudding because it wasn't enough to cover them all.

I used butterscotch flavor pudding instead of coloring vanilla pudding, and they turned out great.

I agree with Betsy.  I followed the directions to the recipe, I did get the holes filled with pudding, but the pudding was to messy.  I put a cover on it and a lot of the pudding came off on the plastic.  I'm glad I tried it before the party or there would have been a lot of messes!

I didn't care for these.  They are probably ok for kids or a just a kids party, but they are pretty odd looking and people didn't find them too appetizing.  Took them to a October potluck bday party.
