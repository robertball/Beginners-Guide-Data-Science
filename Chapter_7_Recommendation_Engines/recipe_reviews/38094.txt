I made this for the first time, making a  few changes according to what I read in the pervious reviews. I put in two eggs instead of the egg substitute, and I only put in 1/2 cup sour cream. I then added a can of cream of chicken soup, and a chopped jalapeno for added kick. Delicioso!

This recipe is SO good!  I was skepitcal when I put it all together, but it turned out fantastic.  I drained the whole kernal corn (it doesn't say to on the recipe), used a little less butter (6 tblsp), used 2 eggs instead of substitute, my cornbread mix was only 7.5 oz, I used the whole can of diced chiles (about 4oz), fresh mushrooms and light sour cream instead of nonfat.  My family loved this, and the leftovers are great! :)

This was awesome!  My husband said, "I can't stop eating this!," and my two four-year-olds both loved it.  
The way I made it was pretty true to the recipe, except that I substituted a can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed) for the mushrooms, and I did not use the creamed corn.  I prebaked the cornbread base for 10 minutes, and it turned out perfectly, not at all soggy.  The cooking time for the assembled dish was then only 30 minutes.
I will definitely be making this again (and again and again...)!  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

My Fiance and I loved this. I cut it in half since it was just for the two of us. I added one regular egg, used canned white chicken, doubled the green chile peppers, ommitted the mushrooms, added a chopped red pepper, sprinkled cayenne pepper on top and used shredded mexican cheese. Oh, and the best part...I added chopped jalepeno. It was spicy and delicious!! Not bland whatsoever.

Unless you have pre-cooked chicken on hand ... what a pain!  I went to store and bought a chicken, followed "boiled chicken" recipe on this site (by the way, very good recipe); then started this meal when chicken was ready.  At that point had already spent 2 hours on this meal!  Anyway, I took other reviewers advice and changed the following ...  2 eggs instead of egg substitute, 1/2 cup & a big spoonful more of sour cream instead of 1 1/2, added a can of cream of chicken soup, used 2 1/2 tbl of diced green chiles & added a finely chopped jalapeno.  The mushrooms were good, but next time may consider cutting in half.  Unfortanatley, I picked up reduced fat jack cheese by mistake.  Was like shredding plastic!  Used a box of "Jiffy" cornbread mix.  Unless you have helpers, prep time is more like 1/2 hour.  When it was finally out of the oven (3 hours later - cuz of cooking fresh chicken) - was very tasty, but needed something more.  Still can't figure out what.  Anyway, much to my surprise, reheated next day & was the bomb!  Some casseroles just need a day to mesh.  All in all, very good recipe, very inventive & am very impressed!  Just make sure you use whole jack cheese!  Oh yeah, a nice salad & some hot bread would go great with this meal.  Would not suggest a vegetable, rice or anything like that.

Yummie!! Everyone here loved it. I didn't add the mushrooms and used  one can of mexican corn. But I did add the cream of chicken soup, half a can of rotel, shredded cheddar and montery jack cheese. I used regular sour cream and eggs. Thought maybe the cornbread mixture needed some more liquid, but it was browned on the edges and just right on the inside. Would make again...Thanks

This is a great recipe.  Quick and easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to use a cooked chicken.  Family really enjoyed it, serve with a side salad.  Very filling.

I loved this recipe!  I used an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms (sauteed with onion), added about 1/4 cup of olives and sprinkled red pepper flakes in both the chicken mixture and the cornbread mixture (since other reviews said in needed some added heat).  Would definately increase the amount of green chilis next time.  This recipe is going into rotation.

Wow! 13 x 9 disappeared in 30 minutes with only four of us. This was sooooooo good. Don't forget to drain the whole corn. I beat two whole eggs instead of egg substitute. I increased the green chiles because we LOVE these to an entire 7oz can. Use whole so you can drain them, then chop into small pieces. I also increased the mushrooms to an 8 oz. can. With the additions this was an AWESOME meal. We had it as a main meal with sour cream on top. Would also be a great side dish but would leave you wanting more. The bake time was more than the recipe suggested. I baked about an hour befor getting a golden brown crust  on top. I left all the other ingredients as is. Enjoy!!

THIS WAS THE BEST AND EASIEST DISH EVER.  MY HUSBAND LOVES IT. I HAVE MADE IT AT LEAST EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR HIM.  BOTH HIS FAVORITES, CHICKEN AND CORNBREAD.  I USE ALMOST 1.5 BAGS OF DUNKIN HINES CORN BREAD MIX AND THE BREAD COMES OUT A LITTLE FIRMER.  ENJOY ALL!!!

Appreciating a complete meal in one dish, this is something I've made several times. 
To give it a boost in flavor and comfort factor I used butter instead of margarine, a whole 4 oz can of chopped green chilies, 2 minced serranos, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp ground pasilla pepper, 1 tsp ground cumin, 2 whole eggs instead of substitute, normal sour cream instead of nonfat and cups of grated pepper jack. I topped it with the cheese during the last 15 mins of baking so the cheese would be creamier. A 9x13 baking dish makes about 6 servings, not 12, if you serve a large salad with it.

Definitely pre-bake the cornbread mixture for 10-15 minutes and I have to recommend adding the whole tin of chillies.

Okay. I know this must be, like, a thousand calories or something intense. BUT it was soooooooo good. I made it for the first time and by the reactions of my family I will continue to make this regularly. I suggest draining the kernel corn before mixing it with the cornbread mixture in the second step. THANK YOU for submitting this recipe. I really think it should be submitted to make $$ it is that good! I feel like I know a secret or something with this dish. Recommend three times over. YUMMY!

Just made this, with suggested changes of 2 eggs in the corn bread batter, and in the chicken mixture; 1/2 cup sour cream and undiluted canned soup (I used cream of celery soup, what I had) and I omitted the salt, there is more than enough in the soup. Turned out very good. I used about 2 1/2 cups of chopped rotisserie chicken and added 1/2 cup leftover chopped broccoli (only because I wanted to use it up). I may tweak it a bit more next time. Since all ovens do not heat the same it took a little longer to bake, almost 45 minutes in my oven.

The cornbread was great, rich and wonderful texture.  The chicken mixture, however, was missing something.  I knew the small amount of green chile would not satisfy my spice taste, so I added about a teaspoon of chopped jalapeano.  Still the sour cream alone did not complient the chicken--it needed more chicken flavor.  Maybe a cream of chicken soup and sour cream mixture.

This was a huge hit at my house.  Even my picky 2-year-old had a plateful.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I substituted 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute, and I added an extra scoop of chile peppers for a little extra zest.  The cornbread crust is incredibly sweet and delicious.  I wish it didn't dirty so many dishes in the prep, but that's just my laziness talking. :)  All in all it was very yummy and relatively simple, and I am going to incorporate this into our regular recipe rotation!

Since I omitted the onions due to personal preference, I started this recipe a little differently than instructed.  I simply melted 1/4 cup butter with some garlic.  I followed the rest of the recipe, only using fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese.  I really like this and it was easily prepared.  The green chiles give the top a great flavor and I love the corn in the bottom mixture.  Overall, this was a terrific dinner!

This was an excellent dish as long as you make some additions suggested by others (thus the 4 stars).  The additions are the half can of rotel, cream of chicken, and packet of taco seasoning.  Otherwise it would have been way too bland.  Also, used only few Tbs of butter and 2 eggs.  Definitely going to make this again.

I modified the recipe based on a combination of other reviews and my family loved it. I substituted the mushrooms with a can of Rotel, I used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute and I used 1 1/2 cups cream of chicken soup instead of the sour cream and it was great! I'll definitely cook it again sometime.

Would give it 10 stars if I could.  My daughter said, "Momma, you need to laminate this recipe to protect it because we're going to be having it often".  Absolutely the best casserole I've made in a long time.  I used mexicorn for color & flavor, canned chicken for convenience, and only 1/2 cup sour cream + 1 can cream of chicken soup instead of the full 1-1/2 cups sour cream.  I also used 2 eggs instead of the egg subsitute.  Otherwise, no changes.  ALSO, it reheats beautifully!

This casserole is sooo very yummy!  It's sweet, savory and sensational!  I didn't have a clove of garlic so I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of granulated garlic powder.  I used 2 large grade A eggs instead of egg substitute.  For the taste preferences of other family members I also omitted the canned mild green chiles and the canned mushrooms.  I used regular sour cream.  So because of the lack of green chiles this recipe stayed to the sweeter side, but nothing wrong with that!!  I highly recommend this recipe and the leftovers are great and easy for reheating.  It took longer than 40 minutes for it to brown and cook properly, more like an hour, but I kept a watchful eye.  Accompanied with a buttermilk Ranch pretossed green salad..this meal became a 'add on' to our list of favorites.  Thanks Michele.

I thought this was a really creative casserole. I agree that the chicken mixture needed more flavor. We live in the South, and we prefer spice! I also agree that cream of chicken soup could sub for some of the sour cream. Next time, I will add some cumin, and maybe some chili powder. I think the cornbread layer could do without the cream style corn, and add a little jalapeño. My cornbread layer came out kind of soggy, so I am going to take other's advice about baking the cornbread first. Otherwise good casserole, will make again.

Next time I will add a jalapeno and a bell pepper for more flavor. It was good, but pretty sweet, and would benefit from some heat. I'm also going to try baking the cornbread mixture first and then adding the chicken mixture so it gets a little less soggy.

The canned corn should be drained.  I thought the cornbread layer was to runny.  Next time I will bump up the seasonings.  Maybe even another can of green chile.  My husband and I liked it enough to have it again but it needs a bit more spice.  I didn't add the mushrooms.  I thought it just didn't fit the type of recipe it was.

Very good!  I too was skeptical but this is excellent!  I used fat free cream of chkn soup & about a 1/2 c. of sour cream...I use liquid eggs almost 100% of the time anyway so no change there.  When I get a rotisserie chicken and have leftovers I always freeze them and that is what I used for this casserole....about three bag's worth!

It was so yummy! I added the cream of chicken soup with the chicken mix, added jalapenos, used two eggs, one cup of sour cream and added sliced olives to the chicken mix. I had no  mushrooms or green chiles but the hubby and I loved it anyway.  Next time I would add more jalapeno into the cornbread mix and green chiles with the chicken.

Very good, I added some cumin, chillie and coriander leaf to the chicken, and I poured the cornbread mixture on top. I aslo used yoghurt instead of sour cream. This worked really well.

I added a few chopped jalopenas and a dash of chili powder.  Your recipe does not tell whether or not to drain corn or mushrooms, I didn't and the cornbread layer was mushy.  I'd try it again as the taste was good, just not the consistancy.

I used kidney beans instead of mushrooms; heavy cream and cream of chicken soup instead of cream corn; and used almost a full lb of ground chicken.  It was a great combination of bread and savory food!  I'll definitely make it again.

Good...but could be better...I love casseroles like this....I cooked cubed chicken breast with the mushrooms, onions, and garlic. I used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred. I also added some chili powder, cumin and dried corriander to add much needed flavor. I only used 2 tblspns of melted butter for the cornbread mixture with just a can of creamed corn, 2 eggs, and another small can of diced green chilies. I mixed the sour cream in with the chicken mixture and it kinda got sloopey on me me......a little to watery.....My mistake not to drain some of the liquid and I poured it over the cornbread mixture anyway. This took soooooo long to cook....still jiggled in the middle and the center never fully set up. I didnt even add the cheese till the very end.....flavor was good, concept was good....will definately try again. I think 1/2 margarine or butter is wayyyyyyyyy to much and could not imagine 2 cans of corn in that mixture. Just needs some tweaking and otherwise is a good casserole. Thanks !

This had a nice flavor, although a tad bit bland.  I made this following the recipe almost exactly.  I did not have a whole onion, and it needed more than the halfish of a large onion I put in it.  I also put in a whole can of green chilis instead of the two tablespoons.  The cornbread "crust" around the edges was a bit thick for my taste.  Next time I'll use a smaller pan and spread the chicken mixture out more.  I also think I'll add some cumin and maybe some chili powder to the chicken mixture next time for added flavor.  The reviewers speaking to a mushy cornbread I don't think realized that this was not supposed to be cornbread with chicken on top, but rather more of a corn casserole.  And perhaps the recipe could be better named to reflect that, even if "Cornbread Bake" does have a nice ring to it.  A lovely recipe all in all that can be easily altered to accommodate extra spices for those who want something with more kick.  Also to those who say this recipe is a lot of work because you have to cook the chicken, I'm wondering how you're cooking the chicken?  I poached 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts while I was chopping and sauteing the vegetables.  It added maybe 5 minutes to my prep time.

Great for lunch, dinner and even breakfast!  Chopping the chicken to small bit size was helpful for serving and eating, added in chopped spring onions before assembly for colour, texture and flavour.  A sure winner.

I thought this recipe was a strange combination of ingredients. However, my family and I thought it was quite tasty. My one complaint is that it was very salty. I would definitely not add any salt and/or buy low or no salt alternatives. You can always add salt when you eat it.

I LOVED this recipe!  I tweaked it to the degree that we'd almost have to call it something different...but maybe not. I couldn't find a cornbread package of the size indicated, so I got two 6.5 ounce packages.  I also drained the whole kernel corn, and used 3 regular eggs, and probably a bit more onion than was called for (I LOVE onions!). Here's where I got creative.  I cooked 5 chicken breasts and shredded them.  I then mixed them with a container of sour cream, 2c Monterrey jack cheese, and a bottle of green salsa (the mild sort).  I spread that over the cornbread mixture, sprinkled more cheese over the top, baked and enjoyed!! My family loved it, and we'll definitely have it again! The earlier reviewer who mentioned that it's a bit difficult without cooked chicken made a point, I think....next time, I'll probably pick up a rotisserie chicken from the deli and use that.

I cooked 5 slices of bacon well done, cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon grease, and broke up the bacon and mixed it in with the chicken. I didn't have chiles so I roasted a red pepper and mixed in some red pepper flakes for heat. I did drain the corn, but the cornbread was still soggy. This tasted good (especially if you like bacon and corn) but didn't care for the sogginess. Next time I may omit the sour cream and mix the chicken and peppers right into the cornbread.

This was yummy!  I changed the recipe by used regular sour cream, 2 eggs instead of egg substitute, and using the whole can of green chiles instead of half.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred mushrooms.  I ADDED cream of chicken and a can of Del Monte Petite Diced Tomatoes with Zesty Jalepenos.  Instead of using monterey jack cheese, I chose a Mexican blend shredded cheese.  With these changes and additions, the recipe was awesome and very flavorful.

Delicious and so easy to make!  My husband kept saying last night "I can't stop eating this!!!" He did, but took it to work for lunch the next day!  I skipped the mushrooms but put more chili pepper in it.  If you want a higher concentration of chicken, you could make it in a 9x9 square dish and reduce the cornbread mixture a little bit.

Excellent!  I reduced the recipe to six serving and incorporated the recommendations of several reviewers.  I added half a packet of taco seasoning, a splash of hot sauce and about 3/4 of a can of cream of chicken soup to the chicken mixture.  I tripled the amount of garlic in the garlic/onion saute and added a sprinkle of paprika, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin and oregano to the cornbread mix.  Out of personal preference, I left out the chile peppers and canned mushrooms.  It had just the right amount of sweetness with a hint of being spicy.  I'll DEFINITELY make this again!  Yummmm!

The flavor was great, but I expected the cornbread to be more firm. Next time I'll probably use a little less butter than the recipe calls for and I'll cook the cornbread for a few minute before I put the chicken mixture on the top.  It's one I'll definately try again.

This was really good. I chopped the mushrooms finely and used regular sour cream. I also used butter instead of margarine and cheddar instead of monterey jack. I also used the entire can of green chile peppers. I put half in the cornbread mixture and half into the casserole with the chicken. And I used one extra-large egg instead of the egg substitute.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and didn't stop at one inch from the edge of the dish. I covered the top completely and it worked perfecly.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I'll definitely make this again.

I love chicken and cornbread and thought this sounded like a pretty good recipe, but needed a few additions.  To the cornbread mixture I add a couple tablespoons of green chilies and a 4 ounce can of mushrooms, and to the chicken filling I add the rest of the can of green chilies, a packet of spicy taco seasoning and sliced olives, and I use a cheese blend with a little more flavor for the topping.  Without the taco seasoning I thought the filling was too bland.  I made this for my in-laws at a family function and now they request it almost every time they come over! (I've also separated the recipe into 2-8x8 casseroles so I can do one without mushrooms for the picky eaters)

Good recipe and I will definitely make it again.  I added more chicken, more chiles, omitted the mushrooms and substituted Pepper Jack cheese.  I don't think I would have liked it as much using Monterey Jack instead of Pepper Jack cheese.  

Next time I am going to reduce the sour cream and  add more chiles (maybe 8 oz instead of 4 oz) or maybe some chopped jalapenos.

This recipe was pretty good overall,however I did make a few changes:  I used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute; I used full-fat sour cream instead of reduced/no fat; I used shredded Cheddar cheese instead of Monterrey Jack; I used a can of MexiCorn instead of regular corn; I used about 3 heaping tablespoons of peppers instead of 2 tablespoons; and I used shredded chicken breast meat.  This is a surprisingly sweet recipe.  I think it may be because I only cook with real butter as opposed to margarine.  This is not the fastest of casseroles, it took me about an hour in prep time.  Next time I will also add more peppers; their flavor is lost in the corn.  I may also try the Monterrey Jack cheese to see if that changes the taste any.  My boyfriend wasn't very fond of this, he found it to be too heavy with all the cheese and sour cream.  This is a dish I will make, but only occasionally.

This was great!  I told my mom about it and she made it the next day and loved it also.  I spruced up the corn bread with red peppers and onions for kicks.  Next time, I would add more seasonings when cooking the chicken also.  Thank you, Michele!  This will be a staple in our house!

This was a great recipe. I used some of the tips from the other reviews. (such as 1-can cream of chicken soup and 1/2-cup sour cream). It was great. Even my 14-yr-old son ate it and he hates casseroles!!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few changes...used cream of chicken soup and only 1/2 cup sour cream instead of the recommended 1 1/2 cups of sour cream. The cornbread mix I used was only 6.5oz, so I added a bit of cornmeal to the mix.  Overall, I really liked it, but my husband didn't.  He says it wasn't hearty enough and he didn't like the chiles.

True comfort food! I added a minced jalapeno and a bit of sugar to the cornbread and some cumin to the sour cream.  It was a "five" before my additions. After, a 5.5.  There were no leftovers.

I would make again but would make some more changes.  I did what others suggested with the sour cream& cream of chicken soup.  I also added sliced olives, more chiles, and some cumin to the chicken mixture.  I think next time I'll leave out the whole kernel corn.  Nothing wrong with the taste, I guess I don't care for the consistency.  All in all a good recipe tho!

Cooked my chicken with a pack of fajita seasoning and a some lime juice, and I only mixed in 1 cup of sour cream. Everything else stayed the same. Really good recipe, I'll definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe.   Like others, I only used a 1/2 of sour cream and added a can of cream of chicken or cream of chicken and mushrooms soup.  I also used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute (I would like to try it with the egg substitute.). I also drained the can of corn. The jalapeño did add a nice kick but be careful you may not want to add a jalapeño if serving this to kids. No matter what event I make this for the crowds rave about it always. Great, great recipe.

Used others' suggestions 6 tbs of butter, 2 eggs instead of egg whites. Used the whole 4 oz can of green chilis, sauteed the mushrooms, used 1/2 c sour cream and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Baked the crust for a little over 10 minutes before adding the topping.  This was awesome.  Will try adding jalapeno next time.  This is comfort food!

We thought this recipe was easy and tasty. I read reviews and followed some of the advice I found. I used 1/4 cup butter (which was plenty), a can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt instead of using sour cream. I used two eggs instead of egg substitute and I added a can of black beans. It took about 50 minutes to bake and turned out great! We'll make it again.

It was a little strange texture wise -- I don't think there was enough cornbread texture -- it got a little soupy.  I subbed in the two eggs for the egg substitutes (ironic) and I also added some sliced black olives from a can that I drained first -- I enjoy that flavor in my Mexican dishes.  I would probably make again, just because it was a great way of using up some leftover grilled chicken breast that would have been uneaten otherwise.

I have been making this casserole forever... the only difference in this one and mine is that I use a mexican cheese blend instead of the monteray Jack cheese and always add a touch of chipotle chili powder (about 1/4 teaspoon) to the onions as they cook for the cornbread part, and I cook the onions in olive oil instead of butter.  DO NOT use fat free sour cream, spring for at least lowfat... much better.  After all this dish is NOT for watching your waistline.  It also works well if you have a small family -- I cook for only two -- by putting it into 5 ounce custard cups and freeze the extras for later.  It reheats very well in the microwave.

I can't give this a 5 star rating because I didn't care for the sweetness, and everyone wished for a little more heat.  I used a whole can of chopped green chilies and pepper Jack cheese.  I think I will tweak this and not use a boxed cornbread mix next time.  It's worth looking at again because it's easy to keep the ingredients on hand.

This was super delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used an egg instead of the egg substitute.  It made me think of the corn casseroles that are popular around the holidays.  Except add chicken and a mexican twist.  Loved it!  I will definitely make this again with no changes.

So, so good!  Love that it is something very different.  Used less butter, used 2 eggs...baked corn base for first 10 min.  Used drained pinto beans instead of mushrooms.  Next time want to use less sour cream and substitute the rest with cream of chicken.  Also will add cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to both mixes.  Good!

Very rich and filling meal! I used a stick of butter instead of margarine, and also added the cream of chicken soup along with 1/2 c sour cream, and 2 eggs instead of egg substitute. This cooked up golden brown and delish! I think next time I will add more chopped green chiles and maybe eliminate the sour cream all together. if using the soup. Hubby loved this one. Thanks!

Excellent!  I changed the recipe based on other reviews.  I decreased margarine to 6 T, used a whole can of chopped green chilies, decreased sour cream to 1/2 cup, did not add mushrooms, added 3/4 of a can of pinto beans (drained and rinsed).  Next time I would decrease the butter to 4 T, NOT add chicken, but add a can of pinto beans and a can of black beans.

This was delicious, if high-fat.  I used two packages of the Krusteaz cornbread mix, which are the 15 oz size and so really increased the size of the recipe quite a bit.  I used about 5 cups cubed chicken, but just 3 cups sour cream--amount for a double recipe.  I used just one small can sliced mushrooms, which I could have increased to 2 cans.  The biggest difference was that I poured 1/2 of the cornbread mix on the bottom of a 10"x15" glass dish, layered the chicken mixture and 1/2 the cheese over it, then poured the remaining half of the cornbread mix over the top.  It took about 1 hour to bake.  The last 10 minutes, I sprinkled the remaining cheese over the top.  Just a little changing around of the way it was put together.  Anyway, it was delicious, and I would make it again this way.  Might cut it in half for just my husband and me, but was making this for a 92-year-old mother-in-law too, who doesn't like to cook, so made her lots to last a while.  Update:  Made again and substituted 1 cup of yoghurt for one cup of the sour cream and was still really good.  Used two cans mushrooms.  Forgot to put the cheese in the middle, but sprinkled some on top after it was done and was still good.  A little lower fat too. Update #2--used too much cheese in the middle layer--next time avoid that, as it kind of drowned out the other flavors.

I only made a few minor adjustments.  Instead of regular corn, I used mexican canned corn.  I used 2 eggs, we don't use substitute.  It was really good.  We eat alot of mexican food so the spice level was a little low.  Next time, I'll add the whole can of green chiles & probably a jap.  The basic recipie is great!

This is a nice change on a chicken dish. Not sure why they only used part of the can of green chili's. Wish I would have used a whole can - it really needed more flavor and now I have a little bit left over. This dish definitely gets better when reheated. I think I under-baked it a bit the first time, but after reheating in my toaster oven it was better the second time. Like other reviewers I did use 2 real eggs and 1/2 cup sour cream and a can of cream of chicken soup.  Next time I'll mix the cheese with the topping and add a jalapeño for a little extra kick.

I used fresh mushrooms and just 1 cup of sour cream. My family loved it! The leftovers were delicious too. We had so much that I froze some and found that it thawed and reheated fine. I will make this one again.

This is a great dish! Like some of the other reviewers I added a can of cream of chicken soup to the meat mixture and I also baked the cornbread mixture for approximately 10 mins to firm it up before adding the meat mixture. I also added cayenne pepper to taste for added spice and more green chiles. My sister and her daughter said it was the best thing they ever ate!

This is an easy delicious recipe.  I did bake the cornbread crust for about 15 minutes before I added the chicken topping.  I also added a can of somewhat drained chopped tomatoes with chillies and a whole can of green chillies.

I wanted to add my own touches, but I was determined that for once I would actually use the recipe.  The only thing I changed was to make my own cornbread mix (since my husband can't have glutens) and use real eggs.

We really enjoyed this dish; the texture was great.

I could not taste the green chiles, so I will either double the amount or omit.  I didn't think the canned mushrooms added anything, so I will either saute fresh mushrooms or leave them out.

I am going to use this recipe to make an Easy Chicken and Dressing.  2 onions, equal amount of celery, fresh Bay, more spices, no green chiles but lots of fresh mushrooms.

I have fresh farm eggs, so I used 2 of those; worked just fine.  I added a 2 oz jar of pimiento for a little Tex-Mex flavor and color. I think next time I will also add a small drained can of black olive slices.  I, too, used the whole small can of chopped chiles.  DRAIN the whole corn can.  I used a package of 4 cheeses shredded and it was just fine.  I think the appearance is as good as the taste; it really is beautiful when it comes out of the oven.  My cornbread mix also comes in a 7.5 oz box.

The whole family loved this.  I did not use mushrooms & I drained the whole kernel corn.  It does state that this is a "lightly spiced, Mexican inspired" recipe.  It certainly is.  It's nice as is but it would be fun to add cumin, chili powder or even a seeded jalapeño for a little kick!  I will have to experiment.

Per other reviews, I used 1/2 cup sour cream, 6 tbsp. butter, 1 full can green chiles, and 1 98% fat free cream of chix soup and this was great!  Adding the soup definitely made my pan very full though, so I will be sure to bake it in a bigger dish next time around.  I shredded my chicken in the food processor, which mixed it in quite nicely.  If you use the soup, I might also use two packets of cornbread mix, because I felt like the one I bought, that was 16 not 18 oz., did not do the bottom layer justice.  Super yummy recipe that even my 20 month old ate!

I made this yesterday before work (I work graveyard) and didn't get to try it before I left. But, brought it with me and the guys I work with ate it all up lol. I think I was the 3rd person to try it and got the comment 'Wow, you make this better than my wife!!' which of course she had a different recipe :) This was soooooo yummy and it's one of my new #1's! I did exchange and use real eggs instead of the subsitute.

My husband, who is a joker with a weird sense of humor, said when he got seconds, "I suppose I have to eat some more of this  to make you happy.  It's the best  you've ever made!"  LOL!  He also told me I could make it again for dinner tomorrow.

This is one of the easiest, best recipes I've ever found on this site.  After reading some of the reviews the only thing I changed was to use a mixture of cream of chicken soup and sour cream.  I didn't have enough chicken from the last chicken I roasted so I supplemented it with canned chicken.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

Guess who just came back for thirds?  He also said I can print this recipe out and frame it.  All I can say is, "YUM!"

The whole family loved this!  I took the advice and used 2 eggs.  Used 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup margarine.  Added the whole little can of chilis.  I left out the onion (personal choice) and added a can of cream of chicken.  Also used canned mushrooms.  I really enjoyed it and can't wait to have it for lunch as most people said the leftovers were yummy!  Great recipe!

This was wonderful! My husband loved it even though he doesn't care much for chiles. (I used very mild palbanos) The one change I made was that I sauted fresh mushrooms in with the onions and garlic instead of using canned. I also used a cheddar/jack blend on top. I will definitely keep this one on my list.

Just made this for dinner and it was amazing. I hope the leftoevers are just as good. I did make substitutions I used two eggs instead of the subsitute. I omitted the mushrooms, added a can of drained rotel to the cornbread mix, only used cream corn as I didnt have any whole corn. I also added diced jalapenos and taco seasoning to the chicken mix. I prebaked corn bread 10 minutes as others suggested. This was great and served with side of broccoli.

Outstanding! With changes for our tastes, this is a regular meal in my house.  I added a jalapeno and one red pepper to onion and garlic, only used a tablespoon oil to saute them, omitted canned mushrooms because I don't like them, and used more green chilis because I love them (like three whole cans more).  Also good to add some cumin to the chicken and pepper jack instead of jack.  Yummy.  Next time I will use more cornbread mix because it never quite set up.

AWESOME!!!  It was yummy and creamy.  Every bite was different!  Not too spicy but I bet you could use pepperjack cheese to give it a little more zip.  One of the best recipes I've tried in a while!  thank you, thank you, thank you!

While the original recipe is good, I thought that it needed a little more "kick". Try a dollop of green salsa or extra diced jalapenos to keep it from tasting like something served in a school cafeteria.

I wish the creator of this recipe had said whether you were to drain the various cans of ingredients you were to use.  It makes a big difference obviously if you pour a whole can of corn in with the water or leave the water out.  
I feel this is a good base recipe, but we made a lot of changes to it.  We cooked the chicken in taco seasoning for the spice because I did not use the peppers (our kids won't eat them).  I did not use butter to saute, I used 1 tbsp of olive oil and it worked perfectly.  I did not use cream corn because I could not find one that is gluten free.  Instead I added a can of black beans and olives as other reviewer's suggested.  When I make this next time I will use 1/2 the cheese suggested and I will not add it until the last 10-15 mins. of cooking as it got a little too done for our liking.  
With the modifications made it was a very tasty dish, tasted even better on day 2, satisfied our low fat/lo cal dietary needs and our need for a gluten free dish.  We will definitely make this one again.

As other reviewers have said, definitely cut the margarine and sour cream in half and add at least 3/4 can of cream of chicken soup and a jalapeño. I shredded my chicken instead of cubing it. DO keep the mixture an inch from the edge. Go ahead and use the low-fat or fat-free versions of everything (something I would normally never do)- it still tastes amazing. This dish is absolutely fantastic.

I liked the idea of this recipe but not the end result. I made it exactly as stated but I will try it again with some of the changes that were suggested. What we didn't care for was the very, very sweet cornbread and the overwhelming taste of sour cream with the chicken. The cornbread was so sweet and didn't go well at all with the onions in it. The flavors didn't mesh. I would leave them out next time. It was suggested to use cream of chicken soup in place of some of the sour cream and that is what I will do next time also. I always try to make and review a recipe as originally written and this is not one I would recommend as is.

This was good but my cornbread was mushy like some others complained about. I think next time, I'll cook the cornbread first, add the mixture and then bake it again.

I made this for my family and they liked it alot. I added a can of black eyed peas (thought I had black beans, but didn't), and a can of mild rotel canned tomatoes. Also added a little kick with some chili powder, extra pepper, etc. Didn't put the cheese on top but served with some sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good and pretty easy.  I halved it successfully.  Some reviews complained it was not spicy or flavorful enough, so I used the Louis Rich brand Southwestern chicken.  I wouldn't change anything, except maybe to use a little more sour cream.  I think the cornbread and chicken went together really well.  Will make it again.  Thank you.

Per other reviewers suggestions I used fresh mushrooms. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the chicken mixture. I cut back the sour cream to only 1/2 cup but when I make again, I will use more. wwe really like sour cream. I forgot the cheese for the top and it was still wonderful! I drained the corn, and added a whole can of grenn chiles. I also used 2 eggs in place of the eggs substitute. It was a wonderful dish and very easy.

This dish was great!  Even my picky family enjoyed it!  I took the advice of a few others and used the cream of mushroom soup and sour cream (omitted the mushrooms-my picky family HATES them).  Will definately make this again!  Makes a great meal served with a tossed salad.

We like cornbread & we like mexican so I thought this would be a hit at our house.  However, I also understand that sometimes a perfectly good recipe just doesn't make everyone happy. It baked nice, looked good but none of us were crazy about the taste & texture of this dish. I still can appreciate those that post these unique recipes and I only wish that we too could claim it as a hit! Therefore, I can't dock too many "stars" because our dislike for this recipe is simply personal preference only. Thanks anyways!

This recipe was pretty good, however I would leave out the cheese on top.  It got chewy, and made the idea of re-heating leftovers unappealing.

Easy to make, and very good. My husband doesn't like mushrooms, so we eliminated those, and shredded the chicken. A Definite keeper recipe!

This was a hit at a company potluck.  I thought the flavor of the green chiles and the cornbread part was awesome but I would reduce the sour cream and omit the mushrooms. I also followed another persons suggestion of using 2 eggs and it worked fine.  This recipe makes a lot!

Quick and easy!  My kids love it.  I was worried about the chiles at first, but they don't add much spice.  The leftovers do wonderful (don't dry out or get a funky consistency) -- easily make for a main dish Monday and repeat w/ the leftovers on Wed or pack & take to work for lunch.

This came out really good! I used the entire small can of diced chilies and omitted the mushrooms b/c hubby is not a fan and used half a diced red pepper instead.  I used about 3/4 cup of sour cream and it was definitely enough. Came out delicious and hubby had to have a second serving.

really good. for the cornbread mix, I put in two eggs instead of the egg substitute, and I only put in 1/2 cup sour cream. I then added a can of cream of chicken soup because of other reviews. I used frozen corn instead of a can of whole kernel corn. The cornbread part was delicious. My only complaints with the chicken topping is that after cooking the chicken and then cooking the pan in the oven, the chicken got a little overdone. and there needed to be a little more of the chicken mixture. maybe an additional 1/3 of the chicken topping recipe. also didn't add the mushrooms.

My husband loved this and ate almost the entire thing so it gets 5 stars. I didn't care for it so much. I thought it was overly sweet, soggy and way too rich. A few changes I made; I used one egg, 1/2 an onion instead of a whole one, I used regular sour cream and omitted the shrooms. Thank you for the recipe on behalf of my husband. Does it even matter that I didn't like it? nope.

After making as directed the 1st time, it was very good. I learned that the cornbread needed to be baked on its own most of the way through, then adding the chicken mixture until heated through. 
I like to saute a seeded, chopped jalapeno pepper with the onion. For the chicken mixture, I love adding a can of rotel, cream of chicken, and a can of black beans drained and rinsed. My kids don't like mushrooms, so I leave them out. My hubbie requests this and the kids love it!!

We didn't like this.  The chicken topping was really bland, despite me putting an entire can of green chiles and a fresh chopped jalapeno.  The cornbread part dominated the dish, with way too much corn & there was nothing in the chicken mix to balance out the sweetness.  I ended up throwing it all away, such a waste of a lot of ingredients.

I LOVED this recipe, however I did make a couple changes. My family aren't mushroom fans, and I have little ones so I knew the green chiles would be too spicy. Instead of both the mushrooms and the green chiles, I substituted one can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chiles (MILD!) I also topped with cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack and it gave it an extra punch of flavor. This has become a favorite of ours!

This was excellent! I made a couple of changes...used 3 tbs of butter (just couldn't bring myself to use a half stick), two eggs in place of the egg sub, and 1 can cream of chicken and reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I wanted to prep this ahead so that the hubby could just put it in the oven...I baked the bread part alone for about 20 minutes (still not set in the middle) and poured on the rest of the ingredients. Let it cool a bit and put in the refrigerator. The next night, baked it at 375 for 30 mins covered and 30 uncovered. We really enjoyed this. Will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but still going to figure out a way to cut down on the sweetness. I only used a 7 oz. of cream corn and added a can of the chopped chili's to chicken and added some to the cornbread. It wasn't very spicy and had an overall sweet taste. Will have to adjust some things next time.

This definitely gets five stars! My husband is incredibly picky, so I struggle to find things that he will actually eat and enjoy. Tonight was the second time I have made this dish. The impressive part is that the first time I made it was 3 days ago. My husband loves it! 
I made a few minor changes both times though. I used 2 eggs instead of the substitute. I eliminated the mushrooms since neither of us like them. I used 1 cup of sour cream and a can of cream of chicken. I also added a 4 oz can of diced chile peppers for extra kick. This was absolutely amazing! Both my husband and I thank you. I will be making this many more times.

I didn't read the recipe carefully and accidentally combined all ingredients instead of separating out the cornbread from the rest, but it turned out perfect by doing that. The cornbread was cooked throughout. Since many complained that the cornbread can be soupy unless cooked separately, this is the perfect solution and saves on cooking time.

I loved this with reviewers changes.  I boiled a pound of chicken strips.  Prebaked the cornbread mixture for 10 mins....it comes out still a bit liquidy.....but, much sturdier to work with.  I then cooked everything for 30 mins - it was golden brown and perfect!  I also used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 can low sodium crm of ckn.  I used 6 TBS of butter and it was plenty.  I used 2 eggs.  I did not add the salt to the ckn mixture since there was plenty in the soup.  I used regular cornbread 7.5 ounces, not sweet.  Used Mozzarella cheese.  It comes out looking a little soft in the middle....but, it's supposed to be that way.

This is the best recipe! Everyone asks me to make this. For a much faster way...USE CANNED CHICKEN(2 cans of Hormel premium chicken breast is perfect). I think it actually tastes better because the chicken shreds a little and it just adds to the flavor!!!!!!

This was quite delicious! My mother makes a corn pudding recipe that is almost identical to the bottom portion of this recipe so when I saw this I knew we had to make it. I did make a few changes based on our families taste preferences: We used real eggs and full fat sour cream and sauteed portabella mushrooms. The mushrooms did not make a big impression on us so I think in the future we will leave them out. Overall a wonderfull dish!

Very very good, even husband agreed. We will make again. Left out the mushrooms (dont like), used real egg and added cream of chicken soup. It really does help the sour cream from curdling. I cut the recipe in half and still have 1/2 leftover after 2 portions. Yummy!!

Made this for friends and they loved it! After reading other's reviews, I decided to bake this in 2 steps. First I baked the cornbread layer for 15-20 minutes and then added the rest of the ingredients and finished baking the dish. It turned out perfectly!

I thought this was really good.  I normally don't make changes but the few I made after reading reviews were sauted fresh mushrooms with the onions and also added chopped tri-color peppers (red, yelow, green), and a fresh jalapeno I used 2 cans of green chilies.  I used mostly sour cream and added about a half a can of cream of chicken soup.  I'm not a big fan of canned soup.  I think it would have been fine with the sour cream only.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli.  Baked a little longer.  Better the next day!

Super easy and tasty! Instead of just green chilies I use a can of Rotel. Like another reviewer suggested, I bake the cornbread for 10 min. While this is baking, I cook the chicken on the stove with mushrooms, Rotel, and a can of Cream of Jalepeno (from HEB). Then chop up the chicken when the timer for the cornbread goes off and add it back to the pan while stirring in the sour cream. This makes a huge batch and you have plenty of leftovers for lunches the next day!

I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers and made this with 2 eggs instead of egg substitute. Also, only put about 1/2cup of sour cream in the chicken mixture. I, unlike others, did not use cream of chicken soup. I think it turned out great just the way it was! I also made a smaller version of this (my son has a milk protein allergy) with a sour cream substitute and without cheese. It was still great! We will make this one again, thanks!

We really enjoyed this!! I now use 1/2c sour ceam as others suggested. The most recent time I made this, I had some carrots that I needed to use so I finely grated them and added them to the cornbread mixture. We the kids asked what the orange was I told them I added colby jack cheese, which I did. My secret! LOL!

Really tasty and great as leftovers, too.  The prep time of 10 minutes is a joke though.  Try more like 30.

Delicious! Substituted with fresh mushrooms for canned and cream of chicken soup for 1cup sour cream. Also, used adobo seasoning. Prebaked the cornbread mixture for 10 minutes but next time I'll try for 15. Everyone loved it including picky eater stepdaughter who said "That was good. Thank you". A small miracle :-)

I just made this and it was out of this world, yummy!  i did make changes from previouse review suggestions.  less sour cream, can of cream chicken, fresh jalapenos and can of green chiles, plus a little chili powder, and I mixed cheese in with chicken and topped  it too.  Also for those of you who less time to cook, I bought a rotissere chicken and used chicken from that, delish!!!!!  Mine was spicy and cornbread was crispy on edges.  We loved it!  We excluded mushrooms.  A must try!!!!!!!!1  Stephanie Gould

This turned out awesome!  I made a few modifications according to personal preference.  Just needed a couple tablespoons olive oil to saute the onions, and used 2 eggs instead of substitute.  I drained my kernel corn.  My filling consisted of chicken, cream of chicken soup, can of rotel, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 3/4 of the cheese mixed into the chicken, with just a little sprinkled on top.  Baked for about 45 minutes.  Cornbread part is very sweet, but we liked it.  It was basically King Ranch chicken with cornbread instead of tortillas.  We loved it!

Excellent!  As suggested, reduced sour cream to 1/2 cup and added 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Replaced mushrooms for 2-3 tablespoons of chopped canned jalapenos.  Recipe says "serves 12", but I have three men at home, and then ate the entire casserole dish!

This is a delicious recipe!!  I read some of the reviews that said it was bland so I added extra garlic, jalapenos instead of chiles, cumin, chili powder and oregano for seasonings.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  It turned out wonderful and flavorful.  The contrast of the sweet corn bread with the savory ingredients is delicious.  I gave it a 4 star rating as I suspect without the added spices it could border on bland.  Overall a wonderful and different dish that I will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe and thanks to all for the great reviews and suggestions!

Yum, although this was very good and quite easy, it lacked a little flavor.  I prepared recipe exactly except mushrooms because of allergies. I will add some seasonings next time.

Oh my word this was delicious! I was very skeptical about adding the chicken separately on top of the cornbread, but it was such a good idea. The flavors are all so different and yet complementary. I will absolutely be making this again. Only used one egg and followed suggestion to pre-bake cornbread.

Okay Ya'll...I'm one of those cooks...always channging the recipe~  So as amazing as it sounded... after reading the reviews I made some changes and it was AWESOME!!  I used Mexican cornbread mix instead of plain, two whole eggs, both corns and a few chopped onions. For the filling I added onions, chilies, 3/4 cup sour cream, rotel tomatoes(drained) and cream of mushroom soup to chicken and I also added some cheese(mild cheddar and monterey), garlic salt and black pepper. We folks in TX like to spice things up a bit.  After I had baked for 30 min (light golden brown on top) I added about 2 cups cheese mixture on top and baked until bubbly!!  It is amazing!  Took it to church and brought non home~

Both my husband and I were disappointed in the results of this recipe.  I followed the suggestion of several other reviewers and omitted the butter/margarine and instead sauteed the onions and garlic in a couple of tablespoons of oil.  I also used two eggs instead of egg beaters, and the whole can of diced green chilis, and topped the casserole with Pepper Jack cheese.   The casserole browned nicely on the edges and when served, it was mushy in the center and overly sweet from the creamed corn.

I think omitting the creamed corn entirely would be the first thing I'd do different in the future -- if I make this again which is doubtful.  I'd also use a package of taco seasoning to spice it up a bit and give it more of a Mexican flavor.

I only used about 2 T butter, and 2 eggs instead of substitute.  Also left out the mushrooms in an effort to be more kid-friendly.  I still can't say that my picky kids liked it, but they may just have wanted to get back outside and play.  Husband and I LOVED it.

Made this last evening and it was a BIG hit! Added some Cream of Chicken Soup & cut down on Sour Cream per some suggestions and also used 2 real eggs instead of substitute. Kids didn't care for the mushrooms so I'll leave out next time but this is a KEEPER! Good comfort food, thank you!

This recipe has become my go-to favorite and I try to keep the ingredients on hand so I can make it anytime. I've made it several times and I think it's best when you DON'T drain the water from the can of corn.  I also substitute butter instead of margarine, use real eggs instead of egg substitute, and omit the mushrooms - and it still turns out great.  Love this recipe!

My husband was very skeptical as he watched me prepare it, but ended up loving it.  I deleted the mushrooms, and next time I will try pepper jack instead of monterrey jack cheese.  And maybe even a little cayenne pepper too.

Pretty good- Made it different of course! Only wanted for four so had to alter some things. Besides chiken only thing that went into the casserole dish was 1 can of cream of corn, 1 egg, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1/2 box of the cornbread, some splashes of hot sauce, and a little onion and garlic.

i love this dish and make it once or twice a month.  i usually omit the mushrooms and green chilis and use a can of rotel tomatoes instead.  i also use whatever cheese i have on hand, pepper jack, monterey jack, cheddar, even slices of processed american cheese, it all comes out great.

I loved this recipe! I substituted cream of chicken soup for a cup of the sour cream, too. I also used fresh mushrooms which I think makes a huge difference. Instead of adding peppers I added some of the water from the peppers and it gave it a tartness. Also, I used a swirl of grapeseed oil instead of the butter. So, so good!

Better than expected (especially after checking it out after only 20 minutes in the oven - YIKES! - I then baked it the full 40 minutes). I baked the cornbread first to provide a nice crust. It all turned out a little messy. Next time it could use some punch up on the spicy side. It didn't seem very Mexican, but still yummy!

This was ok, alot of work and not very filling. Make sure you bake it long enough, otherwise it will turn ouy mushy. I can't think of what would make this recipe better, but it definitely needs something. It's worth a shot tho.

This was a great alternative to red-sauced mexican dishes that I have tried.  I added a whole can of chiles, cayenne pepper (to zing it up a bit) and used 2 eggs instead of the egg sub. It was a big hit with the family and actually was eaten the next day as left-overs!  A dish has to be REALLY special for my family to eat leftovers!

I used FF yougart instead of the sour creme.  I omitted the creamed corn and added a can of Campbells Creme of Pablano Chili soup.  Topped it with both pepper jack and cheddar cheese.  It came out pretty darn spicy but good.

I like many of you did change up the recipe.  I used a can of santa fe corn and used the whole can of chilis.  Skipped the mushrooms and opted for black olives. And of course, real eggs.  Great recipe

I thought this was great and so did my husband.  The chicken mixture was spicy and creamy and went so nicely with the cornbread.  I didn't have cream-style corn for the cornbread mix, but I used frozen corn and a little cream of mushroom soup. I also didn't have chilis, but chopped up pickled jalepenos instead, and I used cheddar instead of Monterey Jack. Delicious!

It's a keeper. I used the following suggestions: cut butter in half, used 2 eggs instead of subsitute, used sharp cheddar cheese and added olives. Then on my own I used a fresh rotisserie from the grocer and 3 dashes of each cumin, oregano and cayenne in both the corn bread mixture & the chicken mixture. My Fiance thought it was pretty good. Good enough to eat the leftovers tonight!

Yummy!  I cut the margarine in half, used 2 eggs instead of the substitute and it came out great.  I also omitted the mushrooms and used more green chile.  Another reviewer questioned draining the whole kernel corn... definitely drain it.  Mine wasn't runny at all.  This was very flavorful.  The sour cream compliments the sweetness of the corn.

I got excellent reviews on this recipe.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe as others recommended.  I added southwestern seasoning (1Tbsp) to the chicken mixture and used colby/jack cheese.  I would also use half the butter next time for a more low cal dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this casserole.  Although, I think next time I would add alittle more spice to it.  Did have a question as to whether to drain the corn - did not but corn mixture was very runny.  So I added another box of cornbread and it turned out great.

This was good, but I will make some changes next time.  I plan to substitute cream of chicken soup for most of the sour cream and I think cheddar cheese would taste much better.

I really liked this dish.  I took a hint from others and left out the mushrooms, decreased the sour cream to 8 oz, added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and a can of Rotel.  It really is better if you bake it the day before and reheat it later.  It gives the cornbread time to absorb the liquid for a better flavor.

My husband REALLY loved this one.  I did too....
it was easy to make and came out perfect.  After reading other reviews, I too decided to use real eggs, light sour cream, and left out mushrooms and the whole kernel corn, one can of the creamed was enough for us.  I'll be making this one again and again , Thanks Michele!!

This recipe was interestingly tasty! My husband & I both loved it. The cornbread was sweet in contrast to the flavor of the chicken and sour cream mixture. I used 2 eggs as did others. I also used a blend of cheeses instead of Monterey Jack. I will definitely use this recipe again and share it with friends!

I was looking for a mild yet flavorful chicken dish to serve my rather picky 2-year old, who has been rejecting most foods that aren't made of ground beef.  However, this was a hit!  I only put 1/4 cup of chopped red onion with 3 tbsp margarine into the cornbread mix (which was Jiffy, as others used).  For the chicken meat, I microwaved 3 chicken breast halves, which probably made closer to 3 cups of chicken meat.  I also used 2 eggs, a whole can of chiles and probably only put a 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack on top.  For the mushrooms, used a can of Pieces and Stems.  So, it was meatier, not soupy/side-dishy.  I am definitely making this again!  We had broccoli on the side, which tasted good with the chicken.

Very good! This is like a combination of  two different dishes that I make. Chicken Enchiladas and a Corn Casserole. I used Cream of Chicken Soup instead of mushroom, and ommitted the jar of mushrooms. I just thought that sounded better. Also used whole can of green chillies and real eggs. (2) Will make again.

This has become one of our family favorites! I also took other reviewers advice and used 2 eggs, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 c. of sour cream plus 2 heaping T. Also, I left out the can of regular corn and only used the 1 can of creamed corn.

I was really excited about this recipe, but I was a little disappointed.  The presentation wasn't that great and I didn't like the mushrooms in this dish.  If I were to make it again I would use sliced black olives in place of the mushrooms.

Very good!  My husband and I loved it. Due to a scheduling snafu... I ended up baking the corn casserole part while the cut up (but raw)chicken breasts and the mushrooms sauteed in the onion pan with a little olive oil.  I also added a little bit more onion and some garlic to the chicken part as well.  I ended up assembling and heating the sauce on the stove and putting the two parts together with the cheese on top about 10 min before the end.  Scheduling aside, it came out very well and in about the same timeframe.

Enjoyed this recipe very much!! I used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute, I only used Half of the mushrooms it called for, and for the cornbread, I used Jiffy! MMmmmmmm... I have VERY little leftover.  It's basically a corn casserole with the chicken/sour cream topping.  I could have used more chilis.. But, this recipe is a keeper!!! Thanks!

Excellent when fresh, the leftovers don't reheat well. The cornbread gets a little soggy the next day, but my 15 month old and my 2 and 3 year old niece and nephew all loved it!! A keeper, but not one to make mroe than will get eaten!

This was really tasty, I substituted the green chilis with chopped jalapenos for extra spice.  The dish and the leftovers were a hit.

Loved the recipe...since I do not like mushrooms I used a can of rotelle tomatoes with the chiles and it really gave it a great flavor...would make again

DELICIOUS!  Flavorful and a great recipe when you're looking for a change of pace but want a warm comfort food on a cold night.  We found a new family favorite!

Excellent.  I made a double recipe, one for home and
one for the office holiday party.  It was a hit at
work (except for those who don't like mushrooms).  And, at home my husband, one child, and I liked it.
A little expensive, I used real eggs.  I used "Honey Cornbread" mix.  I used a good brand of Non-fat sour cream.  In the future, if I do this for a group or for the children, I may omit mushrooms.  (It is a high allergy and highly disliked food.)  It used about 3-chicken breasts for each recipe.

Yuck.  My husband and I picked at this for a few minutes and then ate leftovers from the night before.  He eats anything, but just wanted to throw it out.  Strange combination of ingredients.

I really liked this.  It is a comfort food with no dramatic flavors yet it really brings a smile and a comforting sigh.  I love having my cornbread and meal in one.  It froze and reheated wonderfully.  I used dark meat and wild mushrooms. Thanks for a great double pleasure.

Have made it about 10 times. Great way to use leftover chicken.  Used more mushrooms and cook them some ahead of time.  Put the corn bread mix in the oven and cook for 15 minutes before adding the chicken mixture.

I've made this recipe as-is and then again with some adjustments. As others have said, it's a bit too much sour cream and could be reduced by as much as half. I like to add in some fresh (or lightly sauteed) bell pepper and cilantro with the chicken and sour cream. I also added red chilli pepper flakes for a bit more spice and kick. 

I did have some trouble getting an even bake on this. The cornbread didn't fully cook in the center for me, but this was more prominent my modified version and I think the added ingredients played a role. I reduced the temperature a bit, spread the chicken mixture a bit closer to the edges and cooked for longer.

I used regular sour cream and eggs, a whole can of green chiles, and liberally seasoned my chicken with adobo seasoning while it was cooking. This smelled so good that I was practically clawing the oven door off while it baked. Absolutely 5 stars!

Great family meal!  Only slight change I made was to add a can of Rotel - fire roasted tomatoes and peppers (drained) in place of the green chilies.  Will certainly make again, and will try to have cooked chicken on hand next time!!

I used the chicken and mushroom suggestion cause I had no fresh mushrooms or can chicken and I added about a 1/4 cup milk. This is delicious! I will definitely make again and share with my church family.

I had left over shredded chicken and a can of creamed corn that I bought mistakenly so I looked at recipes that used both and found this one. I did make a couple of changes after reading some reviews. Plus I only used items I had on hand. I didn't have an onion which is unusual for me but had green onions instead so I cooked those and garlic in 1/4 of butter. . I didn't have mushrooms so I added a can of campbells cream of mushroom soup to the chicken. I had a can of hot green chilis so I added some of those. I also added two eggs to the Marie Calander corn bread mix and baked it for about 10 minutes first then added the chicken mixture. It is good!

Pretty good, but I think I'll use more chicken filling or less cornbread next time.  Too much "crust" for my taste.  I topped it with lettuce, tomato, and avocado and enjoyed the middle a lot though.

I made this with Greek yogurt  instead of sour cream.   I think it would also be good with cream cheese .  I used  vinegar sliced jalapenos  from a jar.  I used cheddar cheese.  I sprinkled chili flakes in the chicken mixture. I baked the cornbread mixture then I put on the chicken mixture. Then I baked until the cheese was melted and the chicken mixture hot.  Contrary to another review I only used one bowl for each step.  I made the cornbread mixture put it in the casserole dish, rinsed out the bowl and made the chicken mixture...Washed out the bowl and made my salad.  ANYWAY....I would make this dish again.  I would not used canned soup too bland and salty.  I would think that cooked hamburger would be a nice alternative to this dish with the same ingredients .

This is what I changed: I used two eggs (not substitute); I doubled the chicken; I added taco seasoning to the chicken; added a can of cream of chicken and halved the sour cream; added a drained and rinsed can of black beans; topped with chopped jalapenos. 

I guess that's a lot of changes, but I think the spirit of the dish was left intact. I really liked it, and my husband did too. I'll definitely make this again. It's Tex Mex comfort food!

I made this for the first time and  used 2 eggs instead of the substitute.  I intended to use an entire 4 oz. can of green chiles, but accidentally added 4 oz. can of chopped jalapenos.  The extra kick was a happy accident--it was a HUGE hit.

Whole family gives this one two thumbs up! I've made this recipe about 5 times now.  I added 1 diced red bell pepper, 1/2 tsp chili powder & 2 pinches cayenne pepper to the cornbread. I also used 12 oz (it only calls for 8.5) of Fleischmann's Cornbread as people were saying that it was too sweet and that box was the only one that didn't say sweet cornbread on it. We tried 1 tsp of diced jalapeno on the topping once and it was OK the first day but got spicer the longer it set in the fridge so we nixed that. It does take time to make it but it lasts several days with my small family so it is well worth the time to make as it heats up easily in the microwave.

This was excellent!  Finally something different for dinner.  I did add a can of Cream of Chicken soup and used only about 3/4 cup of sour cream as recommended by others.  I also added one whole chopped jalapeno.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great!

We loved this recipe! Arguably, I had to make several adjustments, but I think even the original would have yielded 5 stars from us. My changes were: I didn't have any creamed corn, so I used a can of cream of chicken soup, 1 1/2 cups frozen corn and a splash of milk in the cornbread batter. I also used two whole eggs instead of egg substitute. We don't like mushrooms, so I omitted those and added a handful of sliced bell peppers instead. I'm not sure if the texture of the cornbread base is supposed to resemble cornbread (crumbly), but mine didn't. It had an almost custard-like texture to it that was just fantastic. The flavors and textures blended very well together and it was a hit in this house. My husband said, "the green chiles definitely make the recipe." I will definitely be making it again.

I made this tonight & it was fantastic! I made the recommended changes & used two eggs, 1 can cream of chicken soup, and left out the mushrooms because I'm the only one who likes them.  I used a deep casserole dish & would recommend sticking with the 9x13 because mine took about an hour to bake.  It came out like a corn pudding which I actually liked.  I also used a rotisserie chicken to save time.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good, but I did follow other reader's suggestions. In the corn bread mixture, I omitted the can of cream style corn and used 2 eggs rather than the egg substitute. In the chicken topping I used a can of cream of chicken soup and only 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used the whole can of chiles. I also added 1/2 a red pepper.

Great recipe!  Followed other reviews and made these changes: Used two eggs, 7 oz can of green chilis, quarter of 4oz can of diced jalapenos, no canned corn - just one 15 oz bag of frozen super sweet white corn, 1/2 cup of full sour cream, can of cream of chicken soup.  Added garlic and onions to chicken mixture (accident but yummy).  Added 1/4 cup salsa to corn bread.  Also added chopped bacon.  Add NO salt - doesn't need it with my additions. Decadent but a bit spicy.  Less jalapeno next time.

This is truly one of the top recipes I've ever cooked in my life! A fantastic dish. I added turmeric, black pepper and ginger (as I do to most recipes). I reduced the amount of chicken by half which worked out fine. My wife and I just felt like we had died and gone to foodie heaven upon tasting Chicken Suiza. I'm so glad I made a double batch!

I  have had this exact recipe for years.  It is outstanding.  I use fresh poblano peppers that I char, peel and chop, and Marie Callendar's cornbread mix, which isn't as sweet as others.  Freezes well, if it lasts that long.

Amazing and easy! I follow one reviewer and did cream of chicken soup with only 1/2 cup sour cream. Super yummy comfort food and made it all gluten free!

Super tasty! The whole family really liked it. I used the suggestion of 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute. The package of sliced mushrooms I had was 6oz instead of 4. I also used a whole (4oz) can of diced green chilies but would actually use two cans next time. This recipe is going into my recipe rotation.

Add 1 can cream of chicken and a little cayenne pepper for some extra flavor. Try cooking the crust a little before adding the chicken topping so it doesn't meld into a cornbread/chicken mush. Otherwise....AWESOME recipe!!

My family mostly enjoyed this recipe.  I hesitate to leave a review because I made modifications, but I will make this again until I find the way my family will eat this.  I did drain the can of whole corn, I used a packet and half of 6.5 oz cornbread mix.  In the chicken, I added half a can of green enchilada sauce with the sour cream, I might cut the sour cream back and add the whole can of green enchilada sauce.  I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with small diced green pepper since I didn't have any green chillies on hand.  I can't add too much spice to our food (my son has GI issues), but I would've liked to have added a can of drained Ro-Tel to the chicken.  And to cut the cooking time, I would just add onion and garlic powder to the corn mix, that way I'm not doing so much "prep" work that part of the recipe, and it still gives it that taste.

This should have been a 5 star.  If the recipe had made it clear to drain the kernal corn, it would have earned a 5!  I assumed since there wasn't milk in the mixture to go with the cornbread, it must need the liquid from the corn.  Nope.  The cornbread part ended up as moosh even after cooking an extra 15 minutes.  Delicious moosh though.  Loved the taste AS WRITTEN!!!  Well, other than "like" ingredients (2 eggs vs egg sub, light sour cream vs fat free, butter vs margarine).  No need to change the core though.  I will absolutely make this again.....but will drain the kernal corn.

Good! I used fresh mushrooms, cooking them with the onions and adding them to the cornbread mixture. I also used low-fat greek yogurt because it's what I had, but I couldn't tell the difference. A whole stick of butter seemed like a lot so I used 6 tablespoons, and a whole-grain cornbread mix. Thanks!

SUPER SUPER YUMMY!!!!  The first time I make a recipe, I always make it as the recipe states. Which is very good!!  The second time I made this recipe, I changed a couple of things.  I used 2 eggs instead of the egg sub and I used only a 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  The cream of Chicken soup made it so much creamier than the sour cream did.  I also used a whole 4 oz can of diced green chiles, which was still very mild. Served with a salad will serve 6-8 People.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is my favorite new dish. I wish I could give it 10 stars. I will be makin' this at least once a month. I added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the cornbread mixture.And 1/2 cup cheddar cheese plus taco seasoning to the chicken mixture. It turned out great!

I loved this dish! Since I was just making it for me and my daughter, I cut the recipe in half and cooked in an 8 x 8 pan. Other changes: used one whole egg, most of a can of the green chiles (and it still wasn't very spicy), no mushrooms, and mexican shredded cheese. As suggested, I cooked the cornbread mixture first for about 12 minutes while I cooked my chicken in the skillet. I should mention that I did use some of a taco seasoning packet to flavor the chicken while cooking.Also, I'm not sure if you really need the cream of mushroom soup that many have added. I almost added it, but decided to go without and mine turned out awesome! Not soggy at all and a good mixture of sweet (from the corn bread mixture) and spice & flavor. Pretty easy to make and tasted great as leftovers. Definitely adding this one to my list of regulars. A great comforting, filling, yet unique dinner option!

This recipe is 5 star with some changes/additions.  We loved this with a little more traditional spice additions to mimic the enchilada version.  I added the whole 4 oz. can chopped green chiles.  They add flavor, not heat.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and 1 Tbsp. dried cilantro.  I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Don't worry, this is supposed to be creamy.  I also prebaked the crust for 10 min on recommendation of another reviewer.  I topped this off with 2 cups 6 cheese Mexican blend.  Then cooked the whole thing for 60 minutes.  We couldn't stop eating this stuff.  I will definitely be making this again with the traditional mexican spices.

I made this Easter weekend while vacationing with a big family group & it was awesome! It's perfect for cooking easily as a casserole & to keep leftovers (which didn't make it 24-hours, it was so good)! It's very filling so I wouldn't serve anything else but a salad at most to accompany it.

I followed the other comments and used a can of cream of mushroom. I regretted not pre-baking the muffin mix as the result was mushy and appeared uncooked even after an hour. It was a disappointment.

Made this tonight and we (me, DH + my sis) loved it! This would not serve 12 around here - the 3 of us ate half of it and looking forward to finishing off later in the week. I followed the recipe. Only thing I'll change next time is increase chicken by at least half more, and shred or dice much smaller so that there's chicken in every bite. Oh, I also added a whole small can of green chiles. (Only 2 Tbsp? Why bother? LOL) And I recommend sticking with the sour cream rather than soup. This is a keeper - thanks!

I made this for company exactly as recipe stated.  I used jiffy cornbread mix and it was way too sweet for this dish.  I love chicken souiza and I love cornbread and thought this would be a good combo.  I think the creamed corn is a mistake as it added even more sweetness.  The best I can say for it is that it made allot.

This was pretty gross. I threw out the leftovers. It didn't have much taste and even thought I precooked the cornbread mixture, it was very soggy in the middle. I will not make this again.

Tasted a bit bland even with the spices. I love anything but cornbread but I think the ingredients can be jazzed up a bit to add flavor.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I used a whole can of hot chiles, and I left out the mushrooms. I also added some taco seasoning to the chicken when I baked it. I followed previous advice to bake the cornbread mix for 10 minutes first. Easy to make and very tasty! Will definitely make again!

Made this last weekend and fell in love. I added some cumin to the chicken mixture, and I LOVE green chilies so used 2 cans of those. I also used Kraft's Classic Mexican Cheese blend - oh so delish! As far as cooking the chicken, I diced some nearly-frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked them like I would for stir fry, and it didn't take much time at all. I actually ended up using MORE sour cream to serve with it, as the sour-ness of the sour cream seemed to really compliment the sweetness of the cornbread. I also used mexi-corn (it was what I had on hand) and the extra flavor of the peppers in the mexi-corn really added some zip to the cornbread base. I will likely sautee some green and red peppers along with the onion and garlic next time. I will be making this again and again...I'm still eating the leftovers which seem to get more and more yummy with each day. Thanks for sharing!!

I have never been a caserole person but the reviews sounded great so I decided to try it.  It was not only good; it was great and like so many others we could not stop eating it.

This was great! Based on the original Jiffy Spoon Bread Casserole I put 1 cup of the sour cream in the cornmeal mixture and the rest of the 16 ounce container in the chicken mixture. Because we don't like real hot foods, I left out the chile peppers and added chopped tomatoes, chopped bell pepper and taco seasoning. 

I didn't have any margarine, onions, or mushrooms so those got left out, but it turned out fantastic anyway.

The only problem I have is for just two of us, it makes way too much!

Hi,
I made several changes to this recipe (as we all do).  I didn't have a package of muffin mix so I just made them from scratch.  Just used the directions from the corn meal box, but just added the dry ingredients. Used real eggs and 1/2 c milk for liquid.  Also used frozen mixed veggies and the cream of chicken soup.  It tasted great and made a huge amount.  Feed 4 kids and 3 adults and had leftovers.  It tasted great.  If I was making for my family I would 1/2 the recipe.

We had friends over this weekend so I made this as a side dish. I was scared to make an entire meal dependent on a new recipe. It was a huge hit. Everyone including the kids and my hard to please hubby loved it. Next time it will be the main course. Combined with salad it is an easy meal that is a crowd pleaser. 
I didn't have the peppers on hand and so opted to omit. It was still delicious :)

I made the 12 servings for 4 adults and 1 child (11 year old) and there were no leftovers...with the adults requesting more.  So, next time I make this, I will double the recipe.  This was easy and delicious!  Aside from the changes that others had made, which were to use 2 eggs instead of egg substitute, added a can of cream of chicken soup and using the whole can of green chile peppers, I also used mixed Mexican blend cheese instead of Monterey Jack.

I seperated the mixture into two baking dishes and preferred the one without the jalepenos.  I think it just adds the wrong type of spice, the dish doesn't need it.  I substituted the 2 eggs and then added a can of cream of chicken soup.  Maybe next time try it without that and additional sour cream.

This was good except my husband said he could taste the cream corn in the cornbread. I added a few jalapeno and a few shakes of cayanne.

I thought it was very good and EASY!  I used a rotisserre chicken, left out the mushrooms and basically everything as is except used 2 fresh eggs as others mentioned.  I forgot to pre-cook the corn bread first so I let it cook for 50 minutes and it came out great, for an extra kick serve with salsa but I left it as is in hopes that my kids would like it not to spicey. I didn't see the need for condensed soup the sour cream and chicken mixture works fine.

This recipe is incredible.  A very easy and filling down home dinner.  I used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and grated pepper jack cheese instead of cliles and monterrey jack cheese.  I only made these changes because that is what I had on hand.  I had enough to have family over, it feed 8 people leaving enough for my husband and I both to take it for lunch today.  Several people wanted a taste and all asked for the recipe! Allrecipes.com is one of my favorite sites.  Keep up the good work!!

An easy to make, amazing tasting dinner. Must add the cream of chicken soup to bring out the flavor. Used 3 heaping tablespoons of butter instead of half a cup and 1/2 cup of sour cream. husband devoured it!

This is delicious, especially after the first or second day!  I took the advice of some people, and baked the cornbread mixture for 10-15 minutes before adding the chicken mixture.  I also did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 can cream of chicken soup, instead of the full amount of sour cream.  I also used the full can of chilies, added a minced jalapeño, and added a little chili powder because I wanted it a bit spicier.  This was really easy, and a nice thing to make for the week.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great!!  I made a couple changes, used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of sour cream, only put a few jalepenos in cause we have two little boys who dont like spicy food and added some of the cheese to the chicken mixture.  I also split up the recipe between two small pans.  Overall though it was delicious and my whole family loved it!  I have many recipes saved on this website but this is the first one ive actually tried and im glad it was the first :o)

Just tried this tonight and it completely failed my expectations.  Not very flavorful, the mix of cornbread with the spices just did not go well.  Love the cornbread idea but am not happy.  Couldn't eat it.

Took the advice of other reviewers; added the whole 4 oz. can of chilis, replaced a can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup sour cream for the 1 1/2 cups sour cream, sauted fresh mushrooms instead of using the jarred, and added two eggs instead of the substitute. My boyfreind liked this quite a bit, but all I tasted was corn. I didn't NOT like it per say, I just think the corn overpowered everything else, and I also expected it to taste more mexican. I couldn't even really taste the chicken mixure on top at all. I'll try this one more time since my boyfriend liked it, but I'll use more chili's, add some mexican spices to the chicken mixure and omit the can of whole kernel corn.

Wow, this is deceptively wonderful! I would have been content with the all-sour cream original, but chickened out (pun intended) at the last minute to make it more hearty for the hubby.  I don't keep cream of chicken soup on hand, so used a can of low-fat cream of mushroom soup and the 1/2 C sour cream, plus a full 4 oz can of chiles and more mushrooms. I also baked the cornbread mixture for about 10 minutes before adding the rest. So good... and it puffs up almost like a souffle! This is one to share.

This is so tasty! Thank you for the recipe! I did quite few changes though. Since I didn't have corn bread mix, I made one from scratch, using a recipe for sour cream corn bread from this site. I sauté fresh mushrooms with a little bit of butter; didn't use cream-style corn. I had only 2/3 cup of sour cream and it was enough. Turned out YUMMY! Oh, following some other reviews I baked the corn bread for 15 min before I loaded it with chicken/mushroom mix. I think all together it took me about 2 hours, because I also had to cook my chicken. But it was definitely worth to make it! :)

Just finished making this dish and althogh I haven't had the pleasure of tasting it because it's cooling it sure does smell delicious. I did though alter the recipe. First I boiled 3 chicken breast, let them cool and then hand shredded the chicken. (which didn't take much time)  I did what others did with the eggs. Instead of egg substitue I used 2 eggs. I left out the mushrooms because I don't like them and instead used the cream of chicken soup as suggested. When it came to the canned green chile peppers, I used two small cans and they were diced instead of chopped. Before topping the cornbread mixture with the chicken I baked it for 10 mins as it was also suggested from previous reviews.

A REAL SUCCESS!  I used butter for the margarine and omitted the onion/garlic and, of course, used 1 real egg.  For the filling, I used a can of Cream of Chicken soup, a can of drained Rotel and 1" cubed chicken; no other seasonings needed.  Just great. Thanks for the idea.  This will make a wonderful potluck dish.

Very good recipe.  My family loved this dish, and they are picky eaters.  I didnt change anything in the recipe.  Although next time I will change the cornbread mix to a sugar free mix.  Overall this was a very good recipe and I will be making it again.

Overall I give it about a 4.5 for the first time.  I recommend baking the corn bread for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the stuff.  Since the recipe did not mention this, mine came out a little mushy and I did not want to risk burning. I put the green chile peppers into the corn bread mix. Overall, lots of good stuff in it, will make it again sometime soon

Absolutely delicious!  My family devoured it and I was so happy.  To think of topping our favorite corn casserole with this delightful chicken mushroom mixture is pure genius!

EXCELLENT!!  Definitely making again!  Small changes I made were can of fiesta whole kernel corn instead of regular...Used the Jiffy brand corn muffin mix cause it was the only one I could find that was 8.5 oz....added little bit of salsa and deleted mushrooms.  Fed our family of 5 with left overs but all of them ate it up!  Served with broccoli and cheese.

going to give this 5 stars even though i haven't tried it yet only because i love all the ingredients it calls for anyway.  a word of advice...there is a recipe on this site called sticky rotisserie chicken (EXCELLENT), and you make 2 roasters at a time.  use one that night, then cool and take chicken off bone to freeze for a later use.  then, when making this or any other recipe that calls for cooked chicken, all you have to do is defrost it.  it's less expensive and you can add/take away flavor/spices you would like.  i do it all the time and it's a great time saver!!!  UPDATE:  i made this adding a few jalapenos and crm of chicken soup and 3/4 c. sour cream...excellent!  i also made a vegetarian version for my son.  used soy chicken and portabella mushrooms for the "meat" and used cream of celery soup instead of the chicken.  he loved it!

I also added cream of chicken soup.  Next time I might use pepper jack cheese to give it a little more kick.  Overall, quite delicious.

Cooking time is wrong, because you have to cook the chicken first. I followed others advice and added 2 eggs instead of egg substitute. I also waited to top with cheese untill 10 min before cooking time was finished, so it wouldn't burn. I think there was probably too much corn, but it was still very good and I will make this again. great receipe! Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I used 2 eggs instead of a substitute, and the store only had a colby/jack mix, but it was really tasty.  I had some later in the evening, after it had been in the fridge for awhile, and it was even better!!!

My family loves this recipe. We love corn and cornbread and this is so easy to make. I have made it with chicken I cooked in the crock pot and canned chicken. It tastes better with the home made chicken but is good with canned chicken if you don't have the time to cook your own.

This is my new favorite dish!  I add a small can of well drained medium salsa to the chicken mixture and I add the full can of green chilies.  Also, it's important to add the cheese only in the last few minutes of baking, or the cheese will just be crusty.  I use fiesta corn instead of regular corn.  I read that others added creamy chicken soup, but I think that would take away from the flavor.  We like it with the sour cream.

This was good... I halved the recipe, so only used a can of creamed corn. Added my homemade taco seasoning to the bottom layer, and sprinkled some on top before the cheese.

I really liked this recipe. It had alot of potential for added ingredients too!!! I used only fresh corn and added just alittle milk to it. I also used fresh mushrooms  If you like alittle spice I would reccomend using more of the chiles. I used the 2 tblsp and even my 2 year old could handle that. This recipe would also be great with roasted peppers added or sundried tomatoes. Thanks...fun recipe and easy to make

This was a hit!  I used all the chiles and added chili powder, cumin & hot sauce to the chicken - sour cream mixture.  Super yummy, savory and sweet warm cornbread.  We ate it right out of the oven.

I have used the recipe again, and again for pot lucks, birthdays, and family gatherings -  Its easy, feeds a crowd, everyone loves it, and it uses rather common ingredients.  I add cumin spinkled in with Cheese on top for additional flavor.

This is a really good way to use leftover chicken or turkey.  Really tasty with a rotisserie chicken too.  I like how the chicken layer kind of floats into the corn bread while it is cooking, so it's almost like  stuffed corn bread (sounds weird, I know).  Thanks!

Loved this!  I used a pre-cooked deli chicken from the market (chipotle/lime flavor) which made this even easier.  I followed the recipe pretty much but I used pre-shredded 2% Mexican cheese, and very little of it to keep fat and calories down.  It was delicious!

This turned out pretty well.  I made the recipe as written, except I left out the mushrooms.  I think next time I will cut down on the amount of sourcream as others have suggested.  I also found that there was way too much cheese, even though I didn't even use the whole bag. It just made the dish too greasy in my opinion - odd, since I am usually such a cheese lover. It was nice comfort food, though, and with a couple of tweaks, I'm  certainly going to make this one again.

My family enjoyed this and I loved the corn bread bottom but did find it to be a tad sweet.
The criticisms from the family was there wasnt enough of the chicken mix. It was overkill with so much cornbread.
Also, as other reviewers have said, try to keep the chicken mixture away from the sides. Thank you, great recipe.

I used regular sour cream and real eggs.  This is a fantastic dish.  It was so much better the next day.  Highly recommended and my friend who is a picky eater loved it.  Super easy and great leftovers!

Yummm-O! Tweaked it a bit, to spice it up for our tastes: baked chicken seasoned w/chili powder in a foil packet, only used 2T butter to saute, added 1/2 can Rotel to the corn mixture, used 2 reg. eggs; Cooked for 20-30 minutes before topping w/Chicken Souiza (adding a little Colby Jack into the mix to make a little creamier) & more C. Jack then baked for an additional 20-30 minutes. Made what I'm sure was already an excellent recipe PERFECT for my fam!

Excellent!  My husband remarked, "Honey, everything you make with cornbread is awesome!"  I thought it was delicious, especially with the little bite to it from the green chiles.  I did use olive oil instead of any butter.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in about a tablespoon, and sauteed fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) in about 2 tablespoons.  All in all, GREAT meal!  Thank you!

I made a half recipe - and substituted regular eggs for the egg substitute.  Don't know if it makes a difference though.  What I DID do differently though is substitute sweet corn cake mix in place of cornbread.  It was GREAT!

This is delicious.  Would be easier with leftover chicken.  I used the whole can of chiles too.  I found that if you use the "cheapy" store brand corn muffin / bread mix, it isn't that sweet.  Thanks for this recipe.  This is one of very few 5 stars I have given.

My husband and I were disapointed with this one.  Too bad since all the ingredients sounded good together.  We agreed with other reviewers that it was too sweet due to the corn.  It was ok for dinner and I had some for leftovers the next day for lunch but after that it sat in the fridge for a few days.This will not be repeated at our house.

We liked it! Since we have small children, I omitted the peppers to the mix. I also found that a whole 16 oz mix of Marie Calendar's cornbread mix was good, but made it too dry (my daughter poured in the whole mix before I could stop her). :D  I utilized the information from previous reviews and used the 2 eggs, the 1/2 C. of sour cream and a can of cream of chicken soup. I used fresh mushrooms as well. On the side, we used Ortega's mild green taco sauce. It really made it taste like Chicken Souiza. YUM! 4 out of 5 voters in our house said make it again!

We loved this! Of course...with some modifications due to our taste and lack of some ingredients. I used two boxes of Hodson's Cornbread Mix because it didn't look like enough with just one. I used 3 not 2 eggs. I cooked up  and cut up 6 chicken thighs, and poured the delicious juices into the cornbread mix as part of the liquid for the cornbread mix. Since I had fresh corn from the market, I sliced the kernals off 2 ears and used that instead of both canned corns. With that, I also microwaved (rather than sauteing) the chopped onion, several sliced garlic cloves and added a half of a big chopped red bell pepper and a couple of tablespoons of butter. That all went into the cornbread mix. Then for the chicken sauce, I used a can of Special Request Cream of Chicken Soup, about 3/4 (or it might have been more) cup of sour cream, and I tossed in a can of pre-sliced black olives! I did put in the salt and fresh ground pepper, but no jalapenos. I also used full fat sour cream. I found out I didn't have any cheese except cheddar and a bag of feta/gorgonzola chunks, so you guessed it- I sprinkled on the feta chunks. It worked to offset the sweet cornbread because it was tangy. It was not too gooey or anything! I'd make it again! My husband (who doesn't love cornbread) felt there was too much cornbread, so I'll probably try it with only one box next time.

I  had to substitute potatoes for chicken as I am vegetarian and had to skip mushrooms as had none on hand. My husband also liked it even tho he is not a cornbread fan. Found it lighter than it appears to be. Good in spite of my substitutions.

I thought this was quite good.  I only used 2tbsp butter....1/2 cup would have been excessive.  I also used 2 eggs for the egg substitute, and when I cooked the chicken I spiced it up with some cayenne pepper and chili powder.  I used a whole can of green chilies and fresh mushrooms.  I think black olives might taste good with this, too.

This was awesome. I used only a couple tablespoons of butter, and also 3 egg whites. 4oz of fresh mushrooms, too, and sprinkling the chiles on the very top made it look more interesting. I tell you, mushrooms and sour cream were made for each other.

This was really good. I had to make a lot of adaptations because with the exception of corn, my husband is completely anti-vegetable. I also substituted some of the sour cream with cream of chicken soup, and I added a can of enchilada sauce. Then I left out the peppers and mushrooms, and added black beans instead. It was awesome, though. My husband loved it. The flavor reminded me a little bit of a chicken quesadilla Hot Pocket.

This was really good after letting it cool.  I used one egg in place of the egg substitue and a 7.5 oz. package of the bisquick mix in a pouch.  I also omitted the mushrooms for the non-lovers.  It came out fine.  I have left over's today, but, not much.  Worth a try!

I loved this dish.  It cooked as quickly as stated and the cornbread was done, though it has a softer/moister texture than plain cornbread.  I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any, and used 2 regular eggs.  I would consider doubling the mild green chilies when I make it again.

This was the easiest thing I have cooked in a long time!  I had no onion and no whole kernal corn, so I had to leave them out.  I also had no green chiles, so I substituted drained Rotel tomatoes.  My husband loved it!!  Thanks.

This was an excellent recipe.  It was quick and easy and chock full of taste.  Also less than 400 calories for a complete and filling meal!

Next time I may add some bacon!

This was a surprise as I didn't expect to like it.  I was trying to use up some creamed corn, but I don't particularly like cornbread and decided to chance this recipe anyway.  I actually liked it pretty well.  Only a few minor changes, such as leaving out the mushrooms since I hate them, and using real egg.  I think adding the chicken and the Mexican flair (and maybe the sour cream) are what turned dry, boring cornbread into something I actually liked.

Ok I personally liked this one, its not my fave but I liked it but my husband and son did not, I think it was the cornbread mixed, he loves cornbread alone but I guess not in a meal :) but overall I liked it and so did our daugther :)

This is great!  I add olives and omit the regular corn and just use the creamed.  I also use a little more cheese - we like cheese!  I make this for functions and company to dinner now!

I make this recipe a lot. When I make it I end up using more chiles because the flavor is kind of bland. Also I use whatever cheese I have on hand, usually Mexican blend.

Excellent dish!!  I couldn't believe how great it looked when I pulled it out of the oven...the cornbread mixture had puffed up around the edges and the cheese had browned nicely on top.  It was even great as leftovers.

Really pretty good!  Nothing I'd serve to company or anything but good for a weeknight meal.  I put it all together at about 1pm and threw it in the fridge, then baked it at 5pm and it turned out fine.  I took the suggestions and added the cream of chicken soup.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!! The only changes I made is I added a little more chicken and used a whole carton of sour cream rather than just leave out the last half a cup. I used regular sour cream and 2 regular eggs, also tossed in the whole 4 oz can of chili peppers. Otherwise this recipe is PERFECTION! Definitely a keeper and something I will make again and again! My family loved it and we all had second helpings and some even had third helpings!

Good recipie but I used 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute and next time i'm not going to leave the 1" gap around the sides.  I thought it would spread out while cooking but it didn't and the edges were just all cheese and cornbread and rather dry.  Other than that it was really good.

The flavor in this is super!  It reminds me of the corn casserole my grandmother used to make.  I expected the bottom to be a firm cornbread "crust" and it comes out very mushy instead but it was still very tasty.

If I make this again I will use 2 cans of whole kernel corn instead of the cream-style, add seasonings to the chicken mixture and leave out the mushrooms.  The mushrooms and cornbread mixture just didn't 'mingle' for my taste.

Great recipe, was a big hit at our potluck lunch at work yesterday. (I made it the night before and reheated it in the microwave, still delicious). I used 1/4 c. butter, 2 eggs, and a small can of green chiles. People who like spicy could very well add jalapenos to this recipe.

Because of temporary dietary restrictions, I had to make this casserole somewhat bland -- no onions, garlic or chiles.  However, it still tasted quite good.  The bottom is basically a Thanksgiving corn casserole.  I can't wait to try the recipe again with the spicier ingredients.  I think I might try mixing in a can of flavored diced tomatoes with the chicken.

The only thing I can say is it seemed to lack something. I think with the sour cream in it, it knocked out the flavor of the rest.

This was great!  I used ground beef instead of chicken, used 2 real eggs and it was a hit.  I kept out the mushrooms because hubby doesn't like them and it was still awesome.  Definately a keeper!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  My husband liked it, but most of it is still in my fridge after a couple days.  I thought it was rather bland and way too much corn.  I thought the bottom was going to be more like a cornbread and it was more like a corn casserole.  My husband can make this for himself in the future if he likes it, but I won't be making it again.

I really enjoyed it.  My husband did not.  The chicken mixture was delicious, and I LOVE creamed corn AND cornbread... so I'll make it for me, but not him again.

This is an awesome recipe that I have made with the regular sour cream and egg (instead of egg substitute.  It is great for a crowd and has got rave reviews every time I have made it.

Very good overall.  Is a good sidedish, but not as a maindish.  I would use less onion and garlic next time.
