I used plain doritos since the recipe said any flavor. It was very easy and I made it for a friend's family since she is in the hospital. I also made an extra one for my family to freeze. I used shredded cheddar instead of cheese slices since that's what I had on hand. It looks great but since one is going to another family and the other is going in the freezer I haven't had a chance to taste it. It looks and smells marvelous though!

This is OK. It is fast and easy and all of the ingredients are usually things I have on hand. Next time I will add a can if diced tomatoes and some onion with the ground beef/turkey.

My family loves this recipe. I use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. I also add a small can of diced chilis to the meat mixture. My kids ask for this all the time!

I like this recipe it reminds me of one my mom made all the time only instead of the cream soup and milk she used evaporated milk. The reason being that it added the creamy texture and thickening qualities without the added chicken or mushroom flavor. We always used nacho cheese Doritos too. It is really good that way. She always served it topped with diced tomatoes/onions and sour cream. Over the years I changed it a bit by adding a can of refried beans to the mix and using cheddar cheese when I did not have velveeta. Also I guess because of the evaporated milk we always cooked it for about 20 minutes and then added more cheese on top for about 5 more.

My teenagers absolutely loved this! I tried a bite and it was good but it isn't friendly for my diet. My kids said I should make it often and actually asked for it again a week later. They also asked if there were any leftovers which there weren't as they ate the whole thing the first day. It was very easy to make especially on a busy weeknight.

It was just ok. I used ground turkey and cooked that with my homemade taco seasoning. I followed the rest of the recipe except I used shredded the cheese on top. The flavor was good but it needed a crunch. I think I will try it again but bake the doritos on top.

So unhappy with our dinner tonight. I wish people wouldn't rate the recipes that they changed from the one offered. I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was completely bland.

Made this a couple nights ago and it was a big hit with my 3 teenagers & toddler. Everyone wanted seconds and I was shocked when the kids wanted it as leftovers for lunch yesterday. I never get my kids to eat leftovers. I used cool ranch doritos next time I'm going to try the Enchilada doritos. Very easy and yummy.

I used an 11 Oz bag of Doritos and still thought it was too much. I also used a yummy Mexican shredded cheese blend. My kids thought it was okay but pretty bland. I agree. If I were ever to make this again (unlikely) I would use fewer chips more burger mixture and top with lettuce tomato and sour cream as a previous reviewer suggested. I would also consider wrapping it in a tortilla.

Made this last night and we loved it. I did make a few changes I added frsh garlic and onion taco seasoning chili powder and garlic powder. I also topped it with green onions and freshly shredded cheese (as opposed to processed cheese slices). Turned out amazing and my boys went through the whole dish!

This is a really good base recipe. I added Lawry's seasoning salt and black pepper to the meat mixture to give an added flavor. My kids loved this dinner served with a side of corn.

It was okay. Not a huge fan but it was good enough to make every once in a while. I added green chilies to the meat and mixed some corn into the mixture before putting into the oven. I also used both jalapeño Doritos and spicy nacho. Added shredded cheese too rather than just the sliced. Make sure to add some extra seasonings.

Doubled hamburger and made in 10x21 dish. added rotel chopped onion and substituded 1 1/2 cup of shred. colby jack tor milk. 2 cans cr. of chicken..put shred. cheese on top as well as more Doritos and put it under broiler for 3 minutes...Still felt like it needed something pretty bland. If I make this again I would add taco seasong garlic and jalapeno...in which case would make it taco pie..I would use sharp cheddar next time as well.

We doubled the recipe and used green enchilada sauce (since the recipe didn’t say which kind to use) and also added a chopped onion. This was super simple and very good! We’ll definitely be making this one again!

I cooked the beef with a packet of taco seasoning. Baked it for 15 mins then another 5 with the cheese (Colby-jack). Very good and VERY easy!

Only used 10oz Doritos and was too much. They got all mushy. And how could anyone really eat this alone? Had to put this mushy mess on a tortilla.

I was in the mood for enchiladas, so I substituted flour tortillas for the chips and added refried beans to the tortilla. I was looking for a non spicy dinner and this worked for me.

Taste is good but it's more like a dip than a casserole. Next time we will try putting it on top of tator tots.

This was only OK. For me it was like eating some sort of meaty cheese dip with the chips already mixed in. Not one of my favorite things.

i made this and i didnt turn out as i had hoped. it may have been that i used too much of the cheese on top but it turned out more like a rotel dip than a casserole dish and the doritos on the bottom were soggy and an unnecessary ingredient. ended up using it for burrito stuffing but will not make this again.

It was fast and easy! My husband ranked it a 7 out of 10:) That's good for him! I added 1 can rotel and used jalapeno Velveeta cheese slices on top to add some spice.

This dish is good! Reminds me of the old days of Hamburger Helper. Cost me all of 15 for the whole meal and Id say it could feed 4-6 people all eating content. Only thing I did different was add some refried beans! I may end up putting this in a tortilla sometime to try that out??

I wasn't to sure about this recipe but I tried it and it was awsome my daughter who hates meat ate half a plate! I didn't just put Doritos on the bottom though I sprinkled some on top too enough to cover the meat and then put the cheese this will b a regular dish in my house now!

The recipe went well. I usually hate going with processed cheese but it worked perfectly for this specific recipe. I did season the meat a little bit just to give it a little more flavor but it stands on its own without that.
