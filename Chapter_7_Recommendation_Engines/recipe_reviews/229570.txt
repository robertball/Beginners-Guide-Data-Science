Very tasty, great dish!

Only change i made was to add some sliced red peppers and some dried red pepper flakes.
Do not skip the whole almonds fried in the oil - these really give it the taste.

This is a good basic Chinese recipe. I used beef instead of chicken since that is what I picked up at the meat store today. I added the red pepper flakes as suggested - if I hadn't it would have been WAY too bland for me. So kudos to whoever suggested that! I also added bean sprouts - they added some good crunch which I like. I used sesame oil instead of peanut - will try again when I have peanut oil. Instead of rice - I used Udon noodles which was amazing with this recipe. Play around with the veg as much as you like - you won't  go wrong! oh-- I also added some garlic!

Not much flavor, and I consider myself pretty lenient as far as blandness is concerned.  Maybe if I would have added red pepper flakes like others had suggested then it may have been saved.

This recipe was awesome! I kinda strayed from the recipe a bit, but the end result was amazing! I didn't have peanut oil, so I substituted with sesame oil which gave it intense aroma and flavor. I also added broccoli, carrots, sweet peppers and pimento peppers (I'm from Trinidad so we get these full flavored peppers without the heat - you can use jalapenos also). I seasoned the chicken breast before adding to the oil, using salt, black pepper, Mrs. Dash all purpose seasoning and Worcestershire sauce. (I read some reviews that said there wasn't any flavor, so I made sure that mine was gonna be full of flavor). When I turned the stove off I decided to just add about a half teaspoon of home-made pepper sauce. I'm from the Caribbean so we love to add our Caribbean flair to everything! The end result was an amazing full-flavored succulent dish that I served over basmati rice. Can't wait to do it again :-)

My entire family really liked the flavor of the recipe.  I used broccoli instead of bok choy simply because already had it.  We burned the almonds, so be 
careful.

Great basic recipe. I did omit the salt having made this before and it made it way to salty for my taste. For vegies I added carrots, cabbage, celery and onion. I also used white pepper as it added a little more heat to it.

Top honors. We made this and loved it. Much to my shame, I was out of ginger (can you imagine?) So I used Chinese Five Spice. I always do my best to make the recipe exactly as the chef prescribes. When I isn't possible I look forward to the next time I make it to the creator's instructions. Still, this is a very flexible recipe that is delicious, open to additional veggies and flavors, and a delight to consume. Definitely a keeper for us. Hope you enjoy this soon.

I made this after work tonight and it was a great meal. I upped the chicken to two chicken breasts and just eyeballed the soy sauce until it was a beautiful color. It turned out great and made 4 full meals. I added just a few dashes of salt, but that was way too much.

Good flavor. I added carrots for color and used significantly more vegetables than called for as they cook down so much. To make it SCD I omitted the water and flour combination at the end. Served on a bowel with a spoon to eat the broth at the end. Next time I would like to use fresh ginger. The peanut oil and Bok Choy give it a Chinese flair.

Pretty much followed the recipe - I didn't read the reviews before I started.   My husband and I felt that it did lack flavor.  I will try it again but will use some of the suggestions from other reviews.   Nice meal to make after working all day.   Came together quickly.

I used fresh ginger. It went together quickly and everyone had more than one helping.

This was great!  I didn't have peanut oil, used olive oil.  It tasted like I had ordered it from the local Wok place...which was what I wanted!  Thanks

We loved this!  I left out the ginger and used three chicken breasts.  I also doubled the bok choy.  We don't eat rice, so wanted more leafy vegetable and chicken to make it more filling.  It was great!  I'll definitely make it again!

Wow this was swooningily delicious!  My family loved this and my 11 year old son said he likes mushrooms due to this recipe ( a major achievement).  I had to use canola oil instead of peanut because I thought I still had oil but sadly did not and I added an extra 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and admitted the salt all together.  Also, I used unsalted slivered almonds that I found in the health food bulk section of our supermarket to imitate restaurant Chinese food almond chicken and I had to use a drained can of chicken noodle soup for the chicken stock as this was another ingredient I forgot to buy at the store. Amazingly with all these changes the end result was fantastic. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. awesome, awesome, awesome!!!

This one's a keeper.  The soy sauce seemed to make the dish a bit too salty.  Some added carrots make the dish appear a bit brighter.

Good, easy to make. Simple flavors. I didn't have peanut oil (used canola) and that may have perked up the flavor. I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and dash of red pepper flakes, but that wasn't enough. I would also use a little bit less almonds next time. This recipe is very healthy w/lean chicken, fresh veggies and heart healthy fat in the almonds and I appreciate that part.

This was a great dish. My picky husband who usually will not eat Chinese food liked it.  I made this recipe as is, except for the bok choy and it was great.  I could see adding different veggies to this dish which would make it just as yummy.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.

Delicious!  I just added extra baby corn and sugar snap peas as I love my veges,  but this was very yummy!  No excuse to be lazy and order Chinese take-out.
