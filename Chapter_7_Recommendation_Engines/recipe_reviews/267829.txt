This is without question the best cornbread recipe I have ever made!  I added 1/2 can of Sweet Corn, a small can of Mild Green Chili’s and 5 slices of Candied Bacon which was chopped up. I used a 12” Cast Iron Skillet and cut the time down to 22 minutes at 400 with the oven set on Convection. Serve it with Honey along side of my homemade Chili.  Wow!!

It was very easy to make! I am used to a very southern cornbread, not sweet, but I have to say  the honey was good and everyone loved it!  I'd make it again!

I added canned Jalapenos and Monterey Jack Cheese and Cheddar Cheese and sprinkled some on top before baking . I am from Texas and this is how we always made it .   Really scrumptious.

This gave me the cornbread I was looking for. Dense, not crumbly. Easy to pick up and eat out of hand.

This is a scrumptious REAL cornbread recipe.  It is not the yellow cakey sweet cornbread that some restaurants serve, it is a real, corn-mealy cornbread.  It is delicious as is, or with the addition of chopped jalapenos or corn or whatever.  The cayenne adds flavor, but not heat. Don't leave it out. Well done, Chef John!

Not so great!

It was an ok texture and consistency but definitely missing something. I would add a can of creamed corn or something else to sweeten it up.

The only thing I would change is the not adding the cayenne pepper. I didn't really like the spiciness.  Otherwise, I loved it.....it wasn't dry at all. I will make it again.

I added 1/2 can of corn, lightly chopped, which added nice pops of flavor. Still, this recipe was a bit dry for my taste.

I didn't like it that much. I followed the recipe exactly the 1st time and then a second time with changes. I used a cup and a half of cornmeal and a half cup of the self rising flour the second time. I mixed all the melted butter into the wet ingredients and then mixed this into the dry, poured into the skillet and baked. My changes made it only slightly better. I liked the flavor, but not the texture. I thought my changes would improve the texture. They did, but only slightly. I would definitely try it, different tastes for different folks. I just like other recipes better.

Followed the recipe as C. John outlined.  This was delicious and fun to make.  4 instead of 5 starts because the leftovers became hard and inedible.  So if you make it, eat it all that first night!  :-)

YES I'll make it again! It is DELICIOUS!! 
Now I gotta stop eating it...there won't be any left for dinner.

I only had "salted" butter so I reduced the salt in the batter to 1/4 teaspoon. Nor did I have honey so I used  MAPLE SYRUP  instead. I had some SHARP CHEDDAR I needed to use up so I added about 1 cup. 
And it's true, the cayenne didn't make it spicy just added a touch of flavor.

As a Southerner, while this cornbread was good, it was a bit sweet for me. However, my husband and son LOVE, LOVE, LOVED it. Quite easy to make. Definitely cook in cast iron!

I used powdered buttermilk in place of fresh and added about 4 tablespoons of honey. I also added about 1/2 cups shredded cheddar to the mixture and then topped it in the pan with a handful more of cheese. The texture was just moist enough to not make a mess of crumbs and cooking it in a 10-inch skillet created a nice, chewy crust.  May sound awful to some but I loved it.

Agree with reducing the amount of butter as mentioned in the notes.  But an otherwise easy/handy recipe.

I made this! Its not bad instead of buttermilk I had to use evaporated milk  and dilute then add 1&1/2 tbsp white wine vinegar to get to buttermilk. Everything else is the same minus the addition of a 1/2 tsp of baking powder because I don't have self rising flour. I'm not sure what the cayenne is playing at but I think the addition of jalapenos chucks may be decent.
Also I next time I am going to add all the dry ingredients together and then add the buttermilk then the eggs whisk and let sit for a bit like 5 minutes then add in that butter mix and pour right back into that cast iron. 
I would make it again because of how easy it is to prepare
