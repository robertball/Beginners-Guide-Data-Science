I have made a similar recipe like this for years, but instead of smoked sausage, you MUST try this with Italian sausage (hot or mild).  I start this off by heating a little olive oil in a skillet and start cooking my potatoes.  After the potatoes have a good start, I add the hot sausage, cut into cubes as well and cook that.  This gives the potatoes a WONDERFUL flavor.  I then add sliced red and green peppers and sliced onions.  I put a lid on it and let it cook so that the potatoes get soft.  YUMMY!  This is great on a buffet for a party.  I haven't made this for a while, but writing this review has made me hungry for it, and now I know what tomorrow's dinner will be!

A small hint about cooking potatoes: If you like your potatoes a little more firm, salt when you start them to cook. If you like them softer, salt when they are about half way done or when finished cooking. Has always worked for me :-)

Very good and easy to make. My boyfriend in particular thought this was the cats meow! I cooked the sausage seperatly as others have mentioned, added garlic, onion powder and 2 TBLS chicken broth when sauting the potatoes. In addition, used 1 red/1 green bell pepper for more color and variety and sprinkled some shredded cheese overall. I would make this easy & economical meal again...esspecially on busy nights! Thanks Jennifer.

I have been cooking this for a few years now, only I fix a much lower fat version using turkey sausage and pam cooking spray. As far as the potatoes go, I find it easiest to cook them in the microwave first and then fry them in the pan with the onions and peppers. It's much faster that way than to cook the potatoes raw in the pan. Just stir it a lot so they don't burn. I also add a lot of pepper and Creole seasoning, then top with torn up 2% cheese slices. Everything gooes together and it's soooo good, without being 800 and some calories a serving.

My family loved this & I'm not sure it can get much easier (excluding a crock pot meal).  I cut the vege oil to 1 tbsp. & used lite smoked sausage & it wasn't greasy at all.  I did add garlic powder... but next time, I will add minced garlic.  This is great & easy, thanks Jennifer! ;)

This is Soooo yummy and Sooo fast.  It's Perfect just as was submitted.  A previous review to use the leftovers the next morning as a sort of hash topped with an egg is a great idea!!!  Folks, on a aide note it's frustrating to see a reviewer either get nasty and degrade the recipe or worse the submitter is just childish. Secondly, don't change the recipe entirely then offer a bad review.  Just submit your own custom version - that's why allrecipes is good enough to offer you that choice. I'm mean really!!!    To finish, this is great man food your sweetheart will be in heaven!

Very good basic recipe....I used Andouille sausage and added some hot sauce, garlic and Cajun seasonings. The leftovers make a delicious breakfast fry up the next morning, just toss in a skillet with eggs for a good meal in a pinch.

Good side dish with eggs Sunday morning! I grated the potatoes, used 1 pound of sliced kielbasa (cooked separately because of the grease), cut the peppers to one and added garlic powder and a touch of salt.Yummy!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I used fresh green beans instead of the peppers though.  Also, I had to cook the potatoes much longer than the suggested time.  Maybe I cut the potatoes bigger than I should have.  It was more like 25 minutes and I added the green beans for the last 15.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to use a lighter sausage but I will definitely make again.

This was great!  I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning for kicks.  I think maybe next time I will cook the sausage seperately, drain it on paper towels and add it in the last 1-2 min of cooking.  I used turkey smoked sausage and it still rendered a lot of fat!  Great recipe though, with great flavor!  Thanks!

this recipe was simple and great for sausage and peppers lovers.  I added oregano,rosemary, salt, pepper, and garlic to give it more flavor.  The potatoes do take a little longer to cook than it says, but really it's very easy and fast.

Had a ton of potatoes I was trying to finish off and this was perfect.  I used a chicken sausage I got from Costco that really enhanced this dish..

Yum! Loved it. A little greasy if you cook the sausage in the same pan, but I didn't mind- great flavor! The second time I fixed it, I cooked the sausage first, drained on paper towels & then cooked the potatoes in the same pan, omitting the olive oil.

I make this same recipe but I do it in the oven!  Cut the potatoes bite sized, as well as the sausage and add the peppers and onions.  Put in casserole dish, sprinkle with black pepper and paprika and cover.  Cook at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, uncover and bake an additional 15 minutes.  Delish!

My husband and grown son loved this dish!  

The only thing I would emphasize is to use a NON-stick pan.  It needs to be a very big pan too.

Made this today using skinless turkey smoked sausaged (lower in fat) and didn't add ANY oil.  Cut up the meat and veggies using a food chopper so everything was the same size.  Put potatoes in the microwave for 7 minutes to soften.  Cooked everything else in a skillet - the veggies made enough juice so the mixture didn't stick and I never needed any oil.  Added the potatoes the last 5 minutes. Seasoned with salt, pepper, and a dash of hot pepper for kick.  We love this dish!!!

This was pretty good and fast and easy. What I will do next time is brown potatoes first then remove them then brown vegies then brown sausage. Then cook together. This way everyting browns and cooks evenly or just the way you want it to. It avoids mushy-ness and bad texture and color.

Very good and I love how quick and easy it was to make. I microwaved the potatoes before stir-frying as suggested by others. Also added about a tbsp of Pepper Steak Seasoning (it's a lot like montreal steak seasoning, but less salt), about 3 tbsp of fresh jalapeno pepper (seeded) and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese. Thanks for the tasty recipe:)

My version makes a little less than this but includes 5 red potatoes cubed with skin on, 1 lb smoked sausage sliced, 1 onion cubed, 1 red bell pepper cubed, 1/2 cup water give or take and one package of Lipton Onion Soup mix.  Brown sauage a bit, throw in onions, pepper, water, and onion soup mix, cover and cook until potatoes are tender.  The pototes release water as they cook so don't add too much water.  When done, let set for 5 minutes for broth to thicken.  Yummy!!!

This was very simple yet very satisfying.  The potatoes did take a lot longer than noted in the recipe.  I added 2 onions cuz we love onions.  I did not have fresh peppers so I added some roasted red peppers from a jar and it was perfect.  Today, we are eating leftovers with cheddar-jack melted over the top and some hot sauce.  I would def make again.

This is yummy and easy to make.  I've used O'Brien potatoes (with onions and peppers) when I don't have peppers on hand or don't want to peel potatoes--delish.  I've also started adding a package of mixed veggies and my family likes it.  You can use turkey sausage too.  Sprinkle with shredded cheese at the end--yum! Great recipe to make to your family's liking.

We really liked this recipe. I added chopped garlic  to the sausage and peppers. i added 
Louisiana Hot Sauce and seasoning salt to the potatoes. I cooked them separately as suggested. This will be a good "comfort" recipe for the winter cold months.

This was very tasty! I threw in some garlic with the potatoes for added flavor and used a chicken & turkey sausage. It was healthy, delicious and not at all greasy! Unfortunately, there were no leftovers.

This was ok. My husband liked it. It would be a lot better in tortillas with some scrambled eggs for breakfast.

I had a little trouble with browning the potatos, they really wanted to stick, then everything felt a little mushy at the end.  I think it would be better to cook the sausage and veggies first, or all together with the potatos, to let them brown a bit too.  It turned out okay, but I would make it my way in the future.

This recipe is really simple, and overall, fairly good. We had only one real complaint: it was a little flavorless. The recipe called for no salt, no pepper--in fact, no spices at all! For people like us who love flavor, this was a little too bland (and I did add some salt and pepper). I think we would probably make this again, but we would add some spices, like basil or cumin

My Mom made this for years! We just called it "that Potato, Sausage and Pepper stuff," when I was younger. There are lots of different versions on this site but this basic recipe deserves the FULL 5 stars due to it's simplicity. Don't over think this recipe, you'll appreciate the flavors more in the end.

A healthier take.   I put the unpeeled but cubed potatoes and Italian sausages drizzled with olive oil in a hot oven for 15 minutes. Then add onions, peppers, garlic, parsley, S & P to taste. Bake uncovered for an additional 1hr. 15 min.  stirring occasionally.  Don't let it get dry.  Add more olive oil if necessary.  Just as tasty and not fried!!

I roasted the potatoes.  It made them more crispy and then added them to the finished sausage and onions.

This would be a 5 star recipe with the following changes: SEASONING! I added a BIG spoonful of minced garlic, and several good shakes of Creole seasoning, and fresh ground black pepper. DELICIOUS! I added the potatoes first, then the onions (which got nice and brown), then the peppers, and finally the sausage and garlic. I just added them to the pan as I got them chopped. This worked perfectly.

Hubby loved it! I was hoping to have the leftovers for lunch the next day - there weren't any. Even our two daughters liked it and they usually don't like fried potatoes. Definately will fix again.  Maybe as a side dish at breakfast with scrambled eggs. YUM!

I say use the following ratio instead: 16 oz fully cooked smoked sausage, 2 medium size onions, 3 large potatoes, and 3 green bell peppers. To use one pot for this is a bit ambitious. You can, but by the time you stir everything around enough for the onions and bell peppers to cook up nicely you've somewhat mangled the potato cubes. I suggest cooking up the potatoes in a large pot and at the same time basically stir frying your sausage, onion, and bell peppers. Also, if one gets finished before the other you can turn it to low that way and avoid mushy veggies. Honestly I put just a light sprinkling of salt on the potatoes twice, and the recipe tastes great without any additional seasoning!

I needed something quick tonight & this was great! I agree with others that it needed to cook a bit longer. I also used a red bell pepper, mild yellow pepper and a jalapeno straight from the garden. I'm also a garlic nut & used several big cloves toward the end of the cooking time with a big splash of fresh ground pepper. This worked great with some Johnsonville Turkey Sausage with Cheddar Cheese that I had on hand.

I use Turkey Kielbaa to cut the fat. Also, I precoook my potatoes some so they don't take so long to fry. Love this recipe been using it for years. Very good on a cold winter day.

I have made a similar version of this recipe using potatoes that were shredded.  I liked the addition of the green peppers.  It has always been a favorite of my husband's.

Potatoes were bland and should have had some kind of seasoning.  The rest of the ingredients brought very good flavor though.  Will try again.

This dish was a hit with my family although I had to make a few changes. First, my husband is allergic to bell peppers, so I had to leave them out. I added fresh rosemary and about 5 cloves of garlic (we love garlic). I used 1/2 vidalia onion and 1/2 red onion. I served it with shredded hot pepper jack cheese on top. Delicious!

This dish was really great, but I had a heck of a time with the potatoes sticking when I tried the initial "browning" step.  I  eventually transferred the ingredients from my stainless skillet to a teflon wok and all went well from there.  I also added cracked pepper for a little more zip.  Excellent!

This is a great meal, but I think adding sliced apples makes it even better. I generally also add chopped carrots, rosemary, thyme, salt, & pepper, and serve with steamed cabbage and a good dark beer.

I make something similar to this, except I add garlic and saute it with the onions and peppers.  I also like to top it all of with shredded cheddar cheese.  this is requested often at my house.

Did you ever have a favorite recipe that you've forgotten about over the years? Well THIS is one! What a fantastic meal! OMG! I have to admit that I've never made it with smoked sausage, just Italian sausage. Now I cant wait to make it, and I'll be trying it with smoked sausage too. Did I just hear my tummy growl? You bet I did!!

I thought this was delicious. However, I found it to be quite greasy even though I used non-stick spray to fry the potatoes. Maybe next time I will cook the sausage (or try using a turkey sausage, or low/no fat sausage) seperate and then mix in with potatoes, onions, and peppers. Also, I will probably add more onions, some garlic, different spices and some hot sauce.

All in all in all this was a hit.The smells of the dish as it cooked were heavenly. The presentation was quite pleasing when it was all done. The leftovers, few that they were, were out of this world reheated the next day. This dish was very easy to fix, a wonderful comfort food for the cold winter months to come. I think it would wonderful with a thick crusty bread and perhaps some spiced apples, etc to accompany it.

This is definitely a keeper that will be fixed again in our household.

For anyone who enjoys sausages, onions, potatoes, and peppers, give this a try. I think you will be quite happy!

Thanks Jennifer for an easy to fix, inexpensive, delicious recipe.

Amazing how well 3 items thrown together can taste.  Neither my husband or myself can eat onions, but we didn't miss them in this dish.  The peppers and sausage had enough flavor.  Only thing I did differently was instead of using oil, I used a little bacon grease for added flavor when browning the potatoes.  This is one of our favorite quick meals.  Serve with some applesauce and salad, and what more do you need?  Great recipe.

This is a delicious recipe. The first time I made it, I made the mistake of using regular beef sausage so the dish had no flavor. When I made it again I used Italian Sausage and it was way better! Thank you Jennifer

This was a great recipe.  I love potatoes and we just happen to be sausage eaters.  My husband loved it and we will make this again.  Might want to add salt, pepper, and garlic to taste for additional flavor.

This was great! My husband and kids loved it. The sausage really gave flavor to the potatoes. We love potatoes and sausage so this was perfect!

This dish took much longer to cook - those quantities are large even for a large skillet. I could tell it would be bland so I added seasonings as I went. This is a nice simple dish when you don't want to complicate things.

I loved the simplicity of the ingredients for this dish. However, that was also the down-fall as it seems to need additional flavor. I added salt and pepper to liven it up a bit.

This is also delicious using Italian hot or sweet sausage.  A little Italian eatery near me makes this and it is one of their signature dishes.  I think using the Italian sausage, with its seasonings, really enhances this dish.

I added 1/2 c. chicken broth to the pan when I put in the potatoes. I added some onion powder, salt and ground pepper. For the sausage, I used 1/2 Andouille (sp?) and 1/2 Three Cheese Sausage. It smelled so good while it was cooking! I'm so glad I saw this quick and easy meal for those nights when it's crazy.

This has been a staple in my home for years.  If you cook the potatoes like the recipe states, it takes longer than 10 min. and uses more oil than necessary, which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.  I have always microwaved the potatoes just until tender.  Use a little olive oil and saute the onions and peppers with a clove of garlic until tender.  Then add the smoked sausage and potatoes.  I use red potatoes (which are smaller) and only 1 pound of sausage.  Then salt and pepper to taste.  Quick and tasty meal.

Love this recipe!  I cook the potatoes about 20-25 minutes and add chicken stock, worcestershire sauce, and italian seasoning.  Everything simmers in the juice and gives it an amazing flavor.

Great technique to get tender potatoes with so much flavor.  I think I liked it best the next morning spooned into a flour tortilla with a scrambled egg on top with shredded cheddar cheese.  Now THAT was delicious.  I'd make this ahead and just heat  some up for breakfast during the week.  It's that good.

Great. What's easier than a one pan meal that goes from start to finish in about 20 minutes. In my version, I used cabbage and green beans instead of green pepper, and added several cloves of minced garlic. For three generous portions, I used 3/4 lb. smoked andouille sausage, 2 onions, 3 medium red potatoes, and lots of thyme, cajun seasoning, s&p.

This is great for a quick, hearty meal or for when you are short on cash, as it's fairly economical. I remember my mom making this for us when we were little, sometimes subbing hot dogs, which were even cheaper, but still very good, for the smoked sausage. I still make this today, sometimes making the substitution as well...It's comfort food! :)

Hilarious how such a simple dish could be such a hit with the family! When I read the reviews I thought it was strange that people were commenting on how much their diners enjoyed it. Sure enough, my husband and five-year old BOTH were going crazy over it and requested that it become a regular dinner! 
I used Turkey Italian Style (sweet) sausage and red potatoes. I did add garlic powder, salt and pepper and used some chicken stock. I gave them shredded cheese to add as they wanted. I also threw some in a frying pan, the next morning, with a fried egg and it was fabulous!

I love this recipe!  It has become my go-to quick meal on a busy weeknight!  I half it and only use 1 lb. of sausage, one pepper and about half an onion.  It still makes enough for the four of us and the whole family loves it!

I make this all the time as it is something that my husband loves and when there isn't much time to prep something more elaborate for supper. One thing I do when we are really in a time crunch is I use a bag of Potato's O'brien, comes in very handy .. all the potatoes, peppers and onions are already in there. Makes for a very quick fix!

Awesome!  We were destined for this dish.  I got green pepper, onion, and potatoes in my veggie CSA bag this week and had just happened to order smoked sausage links that had been flavored with green pepper & onion from 1 of the farms in our co-op. Then I got this recipe in the Daily Dish and thought perfect.  Cooked very close to recipe except substituted olive oil, added a couple cloves of garlic when I added ingredients to potatoes, and cooked potatoes ~10 minutes extra before adding other ingredients to soften potatoes. Everyone loved this! Even my picky son.  I'm sure it would be good with the Italian sausage or healthy version with turkey sausage. Thanks.

When things are tight, we have made this with cut up hot dogs. Start with a little Olive oil & butter, cook the potato's until tender, add a bunch of onions and stir up good. Add the cut up hot dogs and brown them somewhat and dinner is ready. Everyone loves this. We call it poormans meal. I hope you enjoy.

Have made this dish several times in different forms - this one is very good but prefer the zip of either hot Italian or sweet Italian sausage.  Also I add some garlic becuse we love the stuff.  Thanks for remininding me to start making it again.

I've been making this for years, but sometimes cheat and use southern style hashbrowns (cubed in a bag - cooks lots faster) and I mix 6 scrambled eggs (uncooked) and 8 oz shredded cheddar cheese in a few minutes before I take off stove. Serve with salsa.

Great dish simple and to add a bit more flavor I added Mrs Dash and had precooked the potatoes a bit to do better on time.   This will be a winner for my hubby that is for sure.

I used fresh farmer's market miniature red potatoes and added minced garlic and salt and pepper.  There wasn't one bit of leftover hanging around after this meal!  I will definitely make this again.

I had alot of sausages (mild italian, sweet italian, and turkey kilbasa) leftover from yesterdays dinner so this was perfect for me. I added galirc powsder and onion powder and some barbecue sauce just for flavor and my kids are obsessed with hot dogs so I added some cut up hot dogs. I had to cook the potatoes a bit longer but I might have just cut them too big because some of the smaller ones were cooked first. It was delicious and I great hit.

Simple and satisfying meal. I added a can of drained green beans. I think the recipe submitter wanted this to be seasoned however you like. I used salt, pepper and basil.

I fried up the sausage and potatos in olive oil first and added a tablespoon of garlic salt. Also I used red potatos and just cubed them. Then added the onion and green pepper. When it was almost done I added 3 tsp of butter melted in. This was a very good meal and I've made it 3 times in the past 2 wks!

This was a great recipe.  Very easy. I did drain the potatoes on a paper towel and wiped out the excess oil in the pan before adding the other ingredients. This cut down on the greasieness.  It was very easy and something I will definately make again.  I also added spices for flavoring.

Great one pot meal.  I boiled the potatoes until almost tender, then tossed them in the pan with a little oil.  Kept the onions and peppers in good-sized chunks.  Sprinkled everything with garlic powder, creole seasoning, salt and pepper.  I used lite Hillshire Farms smoked sausage.

Hubby made this for us.  He did add some spices to it and didn't use the oil and it worked great.  He used some leftover potatoes that were already cooked so that saved a little time.

I've been making this since my children were young ones. Only difference was I baked it in a 350 oven. I used italian sausage. Stir mixture occasionaly for even browning. Cooked until sausage was browned and potatoes are tender and crisp. Does make a messy oven dish to clean though, but very good. Thanks Jennifer!

i took the advise of other reviewers and cooked the sausage seperately ( i broiled it, after having marinaded it and the onions in some teriyaki sauce) and added other spices to the potatoes as they were cooking.  They took 20 min to soften and even then they weren't as soft as i'd like them.

This recipe is excellent! Many times when you read the reviews you learn what works even better and this recipe is NO exception. I cooked the potatoes separately in a toaster oven...cooked the sausage in an electric skillet and then added the peppers and onions when the sausage was 1/2 done...then added the cooked and browned potatoes to the skillet, covered and let cook on very low for about 10 minutes before serving. OUTSTANDING! the melding of all the flavors made this an awesome dish. Will most definitely add this to the "rotation"!

I've been wanting to try this recipe for quite some time. Tonight, I needed a quick and easy recipe, and this was certainly it. I used some thawed, left-over chicken sausage I'd had in the freezer and threw this together in less than 30 minutes.

This is such a great idea for a quick dinner. Never thought  to put these ingredients together until I saw this recipe! I cut it down to serve two and microwave the potatoes first to cut down cooking time. We always have extra pieces of kielbasa in the freezer and the other ingredients on hand. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I thought this was alright. I do like that it is really filling. To make the potatoes cook quicker, I peeled and sliced them 1/4" and boiled them in some water in the microwave for 10 minutes. Make sure to have a big pot. I used a pan with 3" sides and could barely fit all of the onions and peppers. I also had to cook it with a lid, after adding the rest of the ingredients, for about 25 minutes. The only other change I made was using garlic and mozzarella chicken sausage to lower the calories and saturated fat.

Oh....my....word!!  We loved this, with only a few changes.  I only made half for my husband and I, and it was still plenty.  First I used smoked turkey sausage to cut the fat.  I roasted baby red potatoes but seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and some basil.  While they were roasting I cut up everything else.  I kept that the same but I added 2 cloves of garlic. After that was fried I added the potatoes.  It was one of the best dinners we had in a while!  It quickly became a favorite....i took leftovers for lunch today and it was still just as wonderful.  Thanks sooo much :-)

This was excellent and went well with scrambled eggs. I used chicken sausage. I would reccomend seasoning the potatoes though. Obviously, salt and pepper but I also used lots of Penzey's Forward spice and that gave the potatoes a great flavor. Also, 15 minutes total cooking time for potatoes??? Maybe if you like them raw...Cooked mine for about 45 minutes and they were perfect.

This was great, and so easy!  I used 2 russet potatoes, sliced thin.  I browned the potatoes and onions for about 5 minutes before adding the bell peppers (so that the peppers didn't turn to mush), then added pre-cooked lean Jennie-O brand turkey sausage, sliced, and heated until warm.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy, filling, cheap, and delicious recipe that you can easily make your own with a few additions. Using a red and yellow bell pepper instead of green, and red potatoes with the skin still on made it even better. Cajun seasoning also compliments this really, really well. Will definitely make again.

This was good and comfor-foody. My husband really liked it too which surprised me. Very Yummy. Oh and I used venison sausage. It was a nice way to use up the venison because I don't really like it by its self. Thanks for the recipe!

I also made this recipe for years using sweet Italian sausage. I took the sausage out of the casing, cut it up and put all the ingredients in a microwave safe baking dish with a lid. I put everything in raw, also used red peppers added a little pepper and garlic powder and one half cup water. Cover on med high till done. My kids and husband went crazy over it, it was so flavorful and so easy. I haven't made it in a while but will try it this stir fry way. Hatfield sweet Italian sausage has virtually no fat.

This dish is absolutely amazing. The second time I fixed it I couldn't remember the name, but everyone in the family knew what I meant: The PEPPER STUFF!! It is so easy and tasty. It just has a taste that makes my tongue giggle! Serve it with a lettuce and tomato salad and homemade french bread and a winner is had by all! Thanks so much for the submission.

I made this last night.  Ended up not having bell pepper.  Used three packages of Nolan Ryan sausage and quite a few tators (didn't measure).  Next time I'll cut the tators down as hubby prefers meat.  I did throw some cheese on it to help camaflouge the onions.  Hubby and his best friend ate it up!

I made this last night for dinner. It was DELICIOUS! Everyone gave me props for it. But I did make some adjustments to the recipe. Since we were 8 persons I doubled the amount of potatoes and oil to cook 'em. I only had 1.5 pounds of smoked sausage but it was ok. There was still enough to not being overshadowed by potatoes. Only used 1 bell pepper and an onion and a half. Oh, and I added a pinch of seasoning and salt and black pepper for a hint of spiciness ;). I'll probably repeat this weekly!

Easy one skillet. I made tweaks to the original recipe - substituted sweet potatoes for white potatoes, and Italian turkey sausage for regular sausage. Made for a healthier meal. I do agree with others that the recipe would be quite bland if you do not use your seasonings of choice. I used garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper and a smidge of thyme.

Delicious...I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top right before serving. Even my picky children who don't like onions or peppers said they liked it. I cooked it a bit longer so the vegetables were very tender and sweet.

We make a variation of this often and my family loves it.  It is very versatile and forgiving if you want to change up the seasoning or substitute the type of sausage or some of the vegetables.

We make this outdoors while camping. In a cast iron skillet on a wood flame, and oh my gosh there is something to be said about a recipe being even better cooked outdoors! We use Echrich Keilbasa and do not change a thing!  Oh and I forgot most of the time we fill flour tortillas with this and add some cheese.

I've made a version of this and agree about using hot and mild italian sausage - really adds a zing!  But what puts it over the top is adding cherry tomatoes toward the end of baking (I bake mine.) Gives it a pop!

I use less sausage (6-8 oz per serving is too high in my world) and switch up the sausage for a chicken or turkey sausage.  I also use 1-2 tsp olive oil to further reduce the calories.  Will throw in extra veggies like sliced mushrooms and quartered frozen artichokes to bulk up the healthy factor.

Try putting these ingredients (sub the oil for 1 pat of butter) into a foil packets and grilling them. They are delicious this way!

Toss in some scrambled eggs and cheese! We keep these items on hand for a quick meal anytime of the day. Frozen Potato O'Brien works well in a pinch!

My family really likes this recipe and it is very easy and quick to make. This is very good with turkey smoked sausage also.  I do cook about 15 - 20 minutes after I add the sausage, onions and peppers just to get it a little more browned.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think most families make a variation of this recipe. We didn't have any potatoes so we ate it with some crusty bread. I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt & pepper, some water to help create a sauce, a large onion onion, two huge green peppers, four Merguez sausages instead of a smoked variety and tossed in a roasted red pepper dying to be used from the fridge. Definitely used more vegetables than meat to stretch the small pack we bought. Makes a great meal, definitely would've been more filling if I'd had potatoes. Great dinner for when you need a quick meal during the week.

This is always so good. I just use some garlic salt and pepper- fry it all together. There is something so comforting about this dish and it always reheats well.  For our family, Polska Kielbasa works best! Delish!

Great dish-terrible name.  I added garlic powder, cajun seasoning, and a little lemon juice to really perk up flavors.  Left uncovred when I added the turkey smoked sausage, onions and peppers so they would all brown and not steam.  This is a great basic skilletyou can easily adapt to your tastes.

I thought this turned out GREAT!  I cooked it in an electric skillet using a little olive oil and butter in the bottom.  Cut the potatos into bite size pieces and let them brown in the skillet.  Then I added an orange bell peppter (no green ones on hand), some onion, some green onions with the green stems, garlic, and some whole mushrooms I had cut in half.  Then we used beef polska kielbasa.  I let it heat through.  The kids enjoyed the kielbasa and the potatos while we enjoyed the rest!

Very good and so easy!  I cubed up russet taters and let them brown in olive oil with some kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  Then I added minced garlic, diced onion, a yellow pepper, a red pepper, and sliced smoked turkey kielbasa.  For some additional flavor, I added garlic salt and onion salt.  It tasted great.  Hubby said it would also be good to add eggs and make a scramble.  Maybe next time!

This is great when mixed and put on the grill until the veggies are to your liking.Sometimes I cut everything up, sometimes I leave in larger pieces, either way it is wonderful. Guess what I'm having for dinner tonight?

Delicious! I used my non-stick electric frying pan, sprayed with no stick spray. It worked perfectly and cooked quickly with the potatoes cubed small. I did add salt, pepper and minced garlic. This will become a regular at our house!! Thanks Jennifer for posting this great and easy recipe.

Although the recipe was a tad boring the meal was pretty good. My husband and I kept trying to think of something we could have done to jazz it up. No ideas as of yet, but we'll try it again later.

I used Southern-style hashbrowns and Birdseye frozen stir-fry mix to save time. With a little salt and pepper and venison smoked sausage, this is delicious!!!

This makes a huge portion.  It filled the pan to the brim.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to soften them up before frying, cut back to 1 1/2 green peppers since we aren't big fans of them and used Beef Polska Kielbasa.  I also made cornbread casserole on the side (from this site).  This was excellent.  Next time I will cook the green peppers in with the potatoes so they get cooked more.

This recipe was great! It is so quick and easy! I let it cook a little longer than it says, that way the potatoes were a little creamy. Husband approved! A perfect "after work" meal.

Very tasty and so easy to make. I used Andouille sausage,  and a dollop of sour cream (to calm down the sausage). I make this often, it’s great for dinner and the leftovers make a wonderful hash with our farm fresh eggs.

Very similar to the one I'm used to. Some differences though: my mom and I throw in everything at once, helps with flavor I think. Also add lots of cajun seasoning while it's cooking. It was the only way to get me to eat some veggies as a kid :)

Delicious! A family favorite. For our taste preferences, I add garlic powder and seasoning salt, and use turkey smoked sausage for a little less grease.

I did one green pepper, and one pound of kalbasa, and it was perfect. I also added a little ancho chili pepper which gave it a nice kick. DELICIOUS!

Awesome, easy comfort food...being slightly lazy and always busy, I make it even easier and will use a bag of frozen potatoes o'brien with peppers and onions. Sometimes add eggs, always add hot sauce!

I used red bell pepper instead of green, and added some Cajun seasoning.  It was too salty and the potatoes got mushy.  It was edible, but not my favorite.

I had high expectations based on reviews, but I found this to be a monumentally boring dish. I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and rosemary, but it was still just meh.

I've been making this recipe for years now, both as written and with various modifications. It’s always our first dinner meal to make on our Northwoods WI or MI cabin trips. It’s easy to make, quite tasty, and perfect for a quick meal on a cold night. I always use 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper (we don't care for green peppers). I find that adding salt to the potatoes and stirring them around a bit seems to result in less mushy potatoes. Add the remaining ingredients when potatoes are just starting to get tender. The sausage will take longer than 5 minutes to cook through. Just stir the potatoes, onions, peppers, and sausage every now and then. The potatoes will finish cooking by the time the other ingredients are done. I will note that I have never gotten the potatoes to brown as shown in the picture, but perhaps that can be accomplished if you cook the potatoes separate from the sausage, onions, and peppers and mix together at the end, resulting in potatoes not becoming mush. VARIATIONS: Try seasoning potatoes with salt, black pepper, garlic powder (or even 1 clove garlic, minced), onion powder, paprika, and herbs such as basil, parsley, oregano, thyme etc. I’ve also lightly salted/seasoned each layer of ingredients (i.e. potatoes first, then a little more seasoning to onions, peppers, and sausage). Be careful not to over salt as the sausage already has a higher salt content.

A go to dish,  quick and easy, one dish to clean and we always have these things in our kitchen.  We usually add some minced garlic and dried red pepper; have used fresh jalapenos as an add-in,  a pinch of rosemary or halfed cherry tomatoes; have eaten in a flour tortilla wrap.  Thank you.

Really good and simple dinner.  My only add on was to throw some kale into the skillet and wilt it with other ingredients. Add red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I will add this to our line up of mid-week dinners as it doesn't take lone to make.

We have eaten this for years and we love it. I add some frozen corn during the last six to seven minutes of cooking because my kids always loved corn but not many other vegetables. What could be better than fried potatoes and onions? Fried potatoes, onions and smoked sausage! I buy the sausage every time it's on sale for a really thrifty supper. My husband always says he can smell it from the garage when he comes home from work and is immediately excited about the meal!

Five minutes was way too short to cook - the sausage was still raw.  The sausage should have been fried prior to adding to the pot.  The potatoes didn't brown like the photo.

I made this tonight for dinner.  Husband loved it, and it was easy!  The hardest part is stirring it in the pan, and even that isn't too bad.  Tomorrow I am using the leftovers for breakfast burritos. 2 different meals from one dinner...it doesn't get any better than that.

This is an extremely good dish ... While the potatoes were cooking, I seasoned them with garlic pepper. In another pan, I cooked the the red peppers, onions and sausage. I added minced garlic, a pinch of salt and pepper.... When serving, sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.... The next morning, we mixed the leftovers with scrambled eggs and cheese.... Made an "Out of this World" scrambler....

My husband doesn't care for bell peppers so I tried green beans as another reviewer had stated.  So good!!!  Reminded me of the red potato with green beans and bacon that my aunt used to make.  I did cook the sausage first, then removed it and cooked the onions and potatoes in a little chicken broth.  I didn't have fresh green beans, but I opened a can of green beans and put the sausage back in and yum.  I also added some garlic powder, black pepper and a little bit of Italian seasoning.

My mom used to make this back in the 70's and I loved it then.  This recipe is exactly what she made.  I made this last night and it was a huge hit... stunk up the house really well too!  I will say that there is no way those potatoes are going to cook to tender in 10 minutes.  You can certainly microwave them first to cut down on cooking time, just drain them well before you put them in hot oil.  This is probably one of the easiest dishes to make when you are short on time.  Everyone loved it!

This is a good starter recipe.  I followed someone else's suggestion to bake in the oven. I did brown the sausage in one pan and the potatoes and veggies in another...it gives a greater flavor.  I added a lot of garlic powder, black pepper and a jar of Ragu double cheese sauce for my personal preference.  Baked covered in greased casserole dish on 350 for 30 mins. Thank you Cowboysjenn for this recipe!

Pretty good as is.  I rated this recipe based on the ingredients listed. This morning I wanted to make a breakfast casserole so I took the leftovers and put them in a casserole dish (don't forget to spray it with cooking spray) sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese over the top then scrambled some eggs in a bowl with some black pepper, then poured it over the top.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  This made it a 5 star dish!  Will make this again.

I was in search of a recipe to use up these exact ingredients that I had on hand.  Wasn't expecting more than to just get by in a crunch but was pleasantly surprised.  This was so much better than expected...quick and easy, too!!

Pretty good, I used fresh made pork bratwurst.  I cooked the potatoes separately, set aside then cooked the peppers and onions. I put the peppers aside in a dish then cooked the sausage. Don't clean out the pan, the browned stuff just adds flavor.  At the end I returned everything to the pan and added 3 crushed garlic cloves.  Yummy!

Simple and good. A little high in calories, but not too bad. Just a suggestion though. Do not use an cast iron skillet. I made the mistake and even with the oil, the potatoes were sticking to it really badly.

This was really good.  I'm not a huge potato fan but this was great.  We make something similar without the potatoes and it is also good.  They both have different flavors.  I expected this to be bland but it wasn't.  The meat flavors it well.  I crisped up my potatoes quite a bit but in the final cooking, they became soft so it didn't look nearly as pretty as the pictures but it was definitely good.  My husband had 3 helpings and all of the kids ate it too!

Fantastically simple and tasty.  I did add salt, pepper, garlic and italian seasoning.  I'm rating it a 5 because even though I added to it, it was simple to do.  Based on comments about the potatoes, I decided to roast those separately in the oven with oil, salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  I sautéed the onion, pepper and garlic with salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  I added the sausage next just long enough to heat it, then the potatoes.  Kids ate it up and went for seconds.

I added tomatoes since I love tomatoes and it added the colors too!  And I used both bratwurst sausages and mild sausages instead of smoked sausages.  It tasted surprising good with only salt added on the potatoes!  All flavors come from the rest of the ingredients! Definitely will cook this again!

Made for dinner, was an easy one skillet meal. I added garlic powder, garlic salt, and a little onion powder as well. We used hot sausage instead of smoked sausage and still turned out well.

Very tasty, although for our taste, we didn't use 2 pounds of sausage, only 3/4lb for us and it was fabulous.  I did cook the potatoes for probably 20 min and they were about 1/2 cubes.  Loved this and so did my children.

took others suggestions and added minced garlic, salt, pepper, cooked as written but let it sit covered on low an additional 15 mins while baking dinner rolls and it was DEEEElicious! So quick and easy and even my picky kids loved it! Definitely a keeper!!! Thank you! :)

This turned out pretty tasty.  I agree the potatoes need to be cooked a little longer.  I halved the recipe and added a sliced jalapeno for a little spice.  Good the next day too!

I added jalapenos and used hot sausage. It's quite good, but I feel it's missing something. I didn't use any spices other than salt, however, any suggestions?

It was very easy to make, ingredients I always have in my fridge, but lacked taste. I'd be willing to try again, but would need to add spices or condiments to make it more flavorful.

This is like my recipe for Smothered Potatoes and Sausage, but I tried this version and found it didn't have that "down-home" flavor that I prefer.  Maybe if you added a bit of garlic...

Comfort food!!! Rated it 4 out of 5 because although I grew up eating a dish very similar to this and now make it for my family, I have never had it with peppers.  We add a can of corn instead.  DELISH!!!  and SO easy!  Worth keeping and extra sausage or Kielbasa in the freezer for a quick dinner.  We will definitely have to try it with the peppers!

Quick version, use frozen steak fries, fry or bake & add at end of recipe !I use a mix of Italian sausage  or hot dogs & cut my vegs. in wedges. I serve this on Ital. rolls or in Pita .  Sometimes I make this with boneless chicken thighs & add a splash of wine vinager before serving. Great base recipe that you can  play with & make your own !!!

I have made a similar dish for years, calling it my quasi German dish.  I add garbanzos and cabbage and make a glaze from vinegar, mustard, and corn startch.  Since I make a large amount for the whole family, I saute things one at a time, boil the cabbage, and then combine all and add the glaze.

I use Italian sausage, cut into medallions then cook sausage and potatoes at the same time. Once the peppers and onions are lightly cooked, I top with cheddar cheese and crushed buttery crackers and pop it under the broiler. Yumm!

I didn't care for this recipe. I used red pepper instead of green because i prefer red pepper and used hash browns because i didn't have any potatoes. I'm not sure how/why it got such high ratings.

Excellent! I used the sausages we had on hand, and used red and yellow peppers (again, all I had on hand).  This recipe was great.  Even the kids liked it!  Will 100% make again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is a great recipe. With small children in the house, I eliminate the onions and peppers. I also slice the potatoes thinly and fry in vegetable oil with seasoned salt. A true "meat & taters" meal! You can also cook the original recipe in a deep casserole dish w/ half chicken stock, half water and use as a side dish!

I added a little garlic and some creole seasoning because of other reviewers' suggestions.  I also used a red and yellow pepper instead of green peppers.  My SO thought it was wonderful.  I thought it was pretty good.

This was really good!  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I first diced the potato small and cooked it in a bowl of water in the microwave for 5 minutes first.  That didn't seem to get them at all soft so I gave it another five.  While that was going I sauteed the turkey sausage and a few onions in some olive oil (the turkey sausage didn't give off enough grease of its own).  My fry pan is quickly going downhill and the sausage and onions ended up getting stuck all over the bottom.  When I threw in some water and scraped up all the stuck bits it made its own heavenly smelling sauce that coated everything!  I threw in the drained potatoes, some creole seasoning, some Monterey Jack cheese and put a lid on it. SUPER easy, super good!  Would have given 5 stars if I had a cast iron pan and had been able to get it a little crispy!

I liked this recipe.  It had lots of flavor, but I added some seasonings as other reviewers suggested. I used turkey sausage and reg. smoked sausage but did not use a full 2 pounds and it was plenty. I did not like the green pepper flavor in this, which is why the 3 stars.

Very nice, BUT, with a little help. I used some very strong beef bouillion (about 1/3 Cup water per cube instead of the usual 1 cup)and added just a little to the pan (not too much or you'll be "steaming" the dish)and let it cook off and form a yummy glaze on the ingredients. Also made this with bowtie pasta instead of potatoes....a nice variation.

This wasn't bad, just missing some seasoning.  Next time, I'll probably season the veggies before adding the kielbasi.  I used hot links, which added nice flavor.  I'd probably make again, but would just season more with some garlic, etc.

So Yummy.  I used a combo of smoked sausage and italian sausage.  I added some chopped garlic, seasoning salt, and a little bit of basil and parsley. It was a little greasy, but I found that draining in on some paper towels (the same way I do fried potatoes) soaked up all the excess.  I will definatly make again!

This was a good base recipe, but I think it needed some kind of spices.  It was a bit plain.  Next time I will try adding some and maybe some different vegetables too.  It was nice and quick to make and the clean-up was pretty simple as well.

This was fairly good...I'm not a big fan of smoked sausage.  A little greasy, but in a good way.  I too boiled the potatoes a bit to hasten cooking, added plenty of garlic powder, a little salt and pepper, and dinner was fast and easy.

This was so good and so easy to make.  I added a little garlic this time and may add a little more salt next time.

This was okay, I used Turkey Sausage to cut down on fat/calories, but I think we missed alot of flavor using it. Hubby didn't like it, don't think I'll make again. Sorry, it sounded/smelled delicious!!!

This recipe was okay.  Good for a quick & filling dinner in a pinch but it didn't get rave reviews from my family.  I might try it again & use some additional seasoning on the potatoes.

I use this recipe with either deer sausage, or cooked, sliced Italian sausage.  I add a little red pepper oil to a pan, saute gr. peppers, onion, add the meat to brown, then toss with little more oil to cooked scroodle noodles, excellent!

Very yummy. I added some garlic to the potatoes and used venison sausage. Right before it was done I sprinkled on some feta cheese. No leftoves for us, they gobbled it right up!

This was good and easy. I cooked my potatoes mostly in the microwave so I could use less oil. I added red pepper and some hot sauce to zip it up. I added cheddar to it at the very end. My husband and I both liked this a lot. I'll be making in again soon.
