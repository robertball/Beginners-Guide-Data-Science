I doubled this recipe for a potluck barbecue. It is delicious! I added a little of the pickle juice along with the vinegar, and used a little more mayo than it called for. Keep an eye on the potatoes and don't over cook, which is really the secret to a good potato salad.

This definitely is "Classic" American-Style Potato Salad! And it's a great base to put your personal spin on. Potato salads definitely are "classic" picnic food and no matter what your personal preference potato salad is always a hit! I add more eggs and use white wine vinegar vs. red. For the dressing I cut the mayo with sour cream, used a mix of dijon and yellow mustards and always mix the dressing part separate then add it to the potatoes and veggies so it doesn't get mushy. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe! My only "carb vice" is bread. I'm not into potatoes, rice or pasta, however, this salad is very good and found myself having seconds. My family is German/Austrian and we normally make our potato salad the European way. I've had "American Potato Salad" many times, but this was just a little different and very enjoyable.

This is really good.  Having grown up in the South, this is the potato salad that I remember from potlucks and family get-togethers.  Next time, I'll add a bit more mustard to spice it up a little more and some of the pickle juice to give it more of a pickle flavor.  Better the next day!

I omit the pickle and double the mayo.  I often use white vinegar and yellow mustard.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  I guess maybe I just prefer the potato/mayo/celery-type salad, but I know that the texture of the sweet pickles (which I VERY finely chopped) was fairly disturbing.

I just made this; exactly as written, except I used dried parsley and Vidalia onions. This has a nice tang to it. It does taste like classic salad that you might get in the deli but, of course, with a homemade boost. I would have liked my potatoes a little softer but I always prefer to err on the side of a little firmer over mushed potatoes. It is very tasty while still a little warm. I will serve it to hubby later and he’s going to love this one. He likes these mustard pickle type potato salads. I always made my potatoes for salad by boiling the cubes I had pre-cut and have never been thrilled at my results. I thought it kind of sped things up but it doesn’t really. Maybe cutting them up first boils some of the flavor out of them. There is something different about the taste of the whole boiled potatoes cut up and mixed with the mayonnaise while still warm.

Truly a classic.  Used small red potatoes, cut before cooking.  Used white vinegar in the water resulting in nicely firm (but not hard) pieces.  Used Duke's mayo (a southern brand) which is a bit tangier than Hellman's.  Mixed all the dressing ingredients separately, substituting olive oil for milk.  Then dressed the salad.  Skipped the pickles.  INCREDIBLE.  Thank you for the post.

We like trying new and different recipes.  This was great, just the way it was.  Ok we had to add a little garlic since my family loves.  Thanks for the post.  Will be making it a lot this summer for family dinner.

I would make this again - but I think I would cut back on the vinegar.  I did pour it directly on the potatoes as others suggested so that may be the reason it was so strong.  Thanks submitter.

perfect!  This is truly a classic potato salad with the perfect blend of ingredients.  Only changes were red onion instead of green out of necessity and I like color.  I only had apple cider vinegar and used that instead.  An old Sara Molton trick (Sara's secrets Food Network) is to immediately put the vinegar on the potatoes when they are hot and they absorb the flavor.  I halved the recipe because I was afraid I would go hog wild.  I found the amt. of mayo almost perfect.  I added just a dollop of f.f. yogurt for a bit of tang and not add extra fat.  My potatoes were red butter potatoes and they were perfect in this.  Lovely recipe.  I like this and the "summer potato salad" recipe from this site.  Thanks for the perfect recipe.

I really liked this potato salad. I did not add in the sweet pickle because that seemed too strange. I used 1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard and 1 tablespoon (plus a little more) yellow mustard. I also used 5 hard-boiled eggs. I added paprika for color. I feel like there is something missing to make this a five-star, but I'm not sure what it is (more vinegar maybe because I took out the sweet pickle). My husband really liked this.

I seldom write a review but after making this for a birthday party celebration I had to.  I am known for making good potato salad and have a special-private version that is often requested.  I wanted something different so decided to take a walk on the wild side and settled on this.  Wow!!! It was delicious.  I did make some changes but I don't think anything that drastically altered the outcome.  I left skins on red potatoes.  Used rice vinegar instead of red wine. Replaced relish with finely diced bread & butter pickles. Dried parsley instead of fresh.  When I first tasted it (right after final mix) I did not like it and thought oh boy what did I do.  But after refrigerating and letting everything meld together things only got delicious from there.  Do make this....you will not regret it.  Excellent!!!!

I made this exactly as written.  I was skeptical about the sweet pickles, but man, was the whole thing great!  Even my hubby who is particular about potato salad raved.  I've tried several potato salad recipes, but this is my new go to recipe.  Thanks!

Perfect recipe for the classic summer party potato salad......minus the eggs!  (just my taste) all I do besides no eggs, is add 1 more tbsp of red wine vinegar....because I think if its made the night before, it needs it to give it that kick back after sitting & soaking the flavors....thx for sharing!!

I made this exactly as written except my potatoes were young russets - so not very starchy. My husband asked for an all American potato salad like he remembers as a kid. This got a five star rating from him - and I like it a lot as well, though I am not usually a big fan of mayonnaise type dressings.

Found this to be too bland.....added cayenne, chopped onion with celery; plus lots of dill and celery seed...also some spike along with minced garlic and paprika to enhance the eggs. Used relish as opposed to  chopped pickle.

I don't eat potato or macaroni salad but this got polished off quickly.  I think I used more mayo and celery but kept everything else the same.

This was really good.  Traditional, but with some extra little kicks (like the Dijon, which I love).  Plus, I love that it doesn't make enough to feed an army- my small family doesn't need that much.  We still ate it for 3 days in a row.  I'll make it again.

I like a more adventurous potato salad, personally, and over the past few years I've made many potato salads that I have loved. Unfortunately, my husband has always disagreed. This time I went hunting for the perfect potato salad for his less adventurous tastes and found it. It's good, easy to make, and although nothing fabulous, it certainly deserves the name "classic."

I made this today to take to a BBQ and everyone loved it. I used less mayo than the recipe calls for and it tasted just fine.  I would make it again for another occasion!

Best potato salad ever! I've made my own for years and never been quite satisfied. I did add bacon because we already had some crumbled. To make it even better we had potatoes right out of our garden.

DE-LICIOUS. I have never made a potato salad with eggs and red wine vinegar. Or scallions for that matter. I used to make it very basic, but ALAS! This is fantastic. I went a little heavy on the red wine vinegar, but otherwise it is heavenly. I also chopped my potatoes up a bit smaller since I don't like big chunks. I will make it again and again and plan on toting it to a BBQ ASAP.

I make Potato Salad for home every once and while but I was making it for my son's first birthday party and wanted a good, no-fail recipe - this is exactly it!  I added a little more mayo than the recipe called for.  It was very good, I got lots of compliments.

This is recipe makes wonderful potato salad. I changed the servings to 30 because I was making it for a baby shower at work. The calculations said to use 10 pounds of potatoes!! Made a little bit too much, but that's ok because it is sooo good. I didn't use red potatoes because they were really dirty and I forgot the scallions (green onions) at the store and I used sweet pickle relish. These were the only changes I made. Everyone at work thought it was so good. I had several people request the recipe.  Will def. use this recipe when I am making potato salad for a crowd! Thanks so much.

Great potato salad. I'm teaching myself to cook thibg other than using the microwave. I overcooked the potatoes slightly, I might have have got the wrong parsly I got the kind they us as a garnish. I couldn't find scallions at the store, some one told me ther were green onions. I think it turned out pretty good.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good.  1/2c of mayo is definitely enough if you are only using 2lbs of potatoes as the recipe specifies.  Also, use Duke's mayo for optimal results!  I'll be making this again.  :)

I made half the recipe and followed it exactly (except I didn't have a sweet pickle so used sweet pickle relish against the recommendation of the recipe) and it turned out great. Wonderful flavor. Will make it again.

This is a very good recipe. I personally don't like sweet pickles in potatoes salad; however, chopping them myself and not using relish helped (less sweet juices). I didn't chop overly fine either. The only real difference I did was to season the layers with plain salt and the used celery salt at the end to taste. All celery salt is too much, but that hit at the end worked.

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the pickles, and wasn't sure which ones to buy. I got the small, whole sweet pickles. I must say, this was a very good potato salad! The only changes I made were: I added 1 extra Tbls. of the Dijon mustard and a bit extra mayo.  Definitely a keeper!

I didn't have sweet pickles, so I had to use sweet pickle relish, which worked just fine. I like it! It has all of the ingredients of a classic American style potato salad, just like the recipe title states. Can't go wrong with that.

I didn't really measure anything but just threw the ingredients together as I prepped them. This recipe is just like my Gramma makes only she doesn't measure anything either lol. I'm insanely picky about potato salad- I really only like my GrammaRegina's. It came out AWESOME!! My man said it's the best he's ever eaten!! LOVED IT!! I used russet potatoes because my neighbor gave me about 20 lbs of them I must use up, and I did add a little pickle juice as well as switch the dijon for good ol' yella mustard. I ate two bowls of it before dinner was even ready. It was amazeballs.

I used yukon gold potatoes instead of the red potatoes and doubled the amount of celery for added crunch. Next time I'll omit the pickles just based off personal taste. I also seasoned with paprika. Great classic recipe!

This is an excellent potato salad recipe, and a real crowd-pleaser. This is not a bland, mayo and potatoes kind of recipe. I add Miracle Whip and different kinds of mustard, and probably more red wine vinegar which makes it extra flavorful. Great recipe.

This was very good. Me and the hubs loved it. I didn't know how I was going to feel about the mayo, dijon, and red wine vinegar but it was very pleasant. I substituted regular onion for the green onion since I didn't have it on hand. Also, I nixed the parsley since I was out of it.

This is the second time I have made this version of potato salad. It is the best I've ever made. I agree with another critic - I tasted it right after putting it together and didn't think I liked it very much.  But after chilling for several hours, it was great. I pretty much stuck with the recipe as written except I didn't measure veggie ingredients exactly (celery, pickles, scallions) and probably added a little more than called for. I would give even more stars if I could!
Update - I made this again - used 1/2 of a white onion chopped instead of scallions and more salt (personal taste)- also used 2/3 cup of Hellmann's Lite Mayo instead of regular mayo. It was still great and reduced calories a bit.

I love this salad with one exception..I detest sweet pickle. If you use dill pickle instead it is just wonderful! Thanks!

I have made so many different types of potato salad - some good, some not so good.  This one is PERFECT.  It can't get any easier or more delicious.  This is now my "go to" potato salad.  Everyone in my family loved it and went back for more.

Family enjoyed the taste, I however did not cook the potatoes long enough....some were a little hard, not to earth shattering since I made 5 lbs., and they ate half of it!
