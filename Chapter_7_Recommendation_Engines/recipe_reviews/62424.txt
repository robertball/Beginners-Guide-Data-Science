Liked this salad very much.  I did add a little bit of vinegar to give it a zing.  Also I substituted half the mayo with plain yogurt to lower the fat content.  My family liked it and didn't notice the yogurt.  I liked the color, it makes an attractive salad.

Made this recipe several times and keeps coming up a winner.  To keep it new with old guests, I added a tablespoon of fresh ground ginger.  Surprisingly, nobody could name the taste, but loved the enhanced flavor.  We will keep making this one.

The dressing for this coleslaw is the best!  It provides the perfect amount of tartness--something I could never achieve using pickle juice.  I made the slaw using green cabbage and only one apple and it was great.

I was worried about serving this at a BBQ since it was a little different and had no reviews at the time I made it.  I had nothing to worry about though.  It got rave reviews from my guests.  I enjoyed it as well.  I did, however, leave out the onion & added some grated carrot.  I am not a fan of raw onion.  It still turned out great...and the flavor was good.  I may try substituting yogurt next time, like the previous reviewer.  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Made it for a New Years Eve party and had rave reviews. Like others have said, this slaw was enjoyed by cole slaw   fans in addition to those who don't normally like slaw. I made this exactly by the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  There is definitely more prep time than a jar of Marzetti's and a bag of cabbage but it's well worth the time and effort for something different and very tasty that will probably become one of your favorite way to make slaw.

This was very good.  Everyone enjoyed the taste, and liked it much better than the typical coleslaw.  I also thought it was pretty, which was a plus. Very easy to make.

This cole slaw was delicious!  It's surprisingly not as fruity as I thought it would be, with 2 apples in it.  Served it with ham.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Yum!

The dressing is wonderful and the fuji apples add a nice zing.  It was great even with green cabbage, which is what I had in the house at the time...my mom raved about this recipe!

Yum!
Don't like coleslaw and have never made it, but I may have changed my mind....

Added some citrus champagne vinegar (had some in the cupboard), about a tablespoon to my doubled recipe, and it's fabulous! Gives it a little zing with the sweetness. I also cheated, bought the pre-chopped purple cabbage packages, But I did cut my apples into matchstick-like pieces.

This was delicious - I'm not a coleslaw fan, but I really liked this.  I brought it to a function and it was the only thing gone.  I'll be making this again soon (to use up the red cabbage!).

I made this the other night with a beautiful head of organic cabbage, a couple of organic braeburn apples, and a sweet organic florida onion.  I sustituted 2 Tablespoons cider vinegar  for the milk and used slightly less light mayo.  Nothing gets finely diced or minced in my house so their were nice chunks of apple and sweet onion to compliment the cabbage, which I sliced instead of shredded (because I like long cole slaw).  It was fabulous and I'll definitely make again!

Fantastic and simple. Didn't have lemon juice so I went with apple cider vinegar, and next time will likely try it with Greek yogurt instead. 

Sounds odd, but my husband put some in a container and mixed in some canned tuna to take to work for lunch and he said it was great.

Delicious!  Great flavor and surprising pink sauce.

Made the mayo in the blender then added the rest of the sauce ingredients sans milk. Skipped the onion too...

This is one of my all time favorites. Great with hot dogs/hamburgers and once made it as a side w/ stone crab claws. YUM! We like Gala apples, but the green apples look best.  For the dressing, I have used vinegar instead of lemon juice in a pinch, and that's good, too.

i have made this slaw over the last 2 years for every BBQ & it's always a huge hit.  The only thing I add is a few handfuls of golden raisins (my hubby says is a necessity to any cole slaw).

This is very good. I used a whole head (small) of purple cabbage and after tasting the dressing, I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of sugar. Didn't have lemon juice so I used apple cider vinegar. I'll make this again. It came together in minutes.

This was yummy. Made it with green cabbage and left the onion out (hubby doesn't like raw onions) but kept the dressing as is. Very good, and a nice change from the typical "southern" slaw we always make.

Great decorate color, but very bland. I have always added apples to slaw, but left the peeling on for extra nutritional value. I use a blender or food processor, which makes it easier to prepare. I added vinegar (about 1/4 cup) and additional sugar (about 1/2 cup). Tasted better.

My fiance hates coleslaw and any mayonnaise based salads... and he ate every last bite.  I used 3 small pink lady apples and sweet onion - it was, as someone else mentioned, not as sweet as you would expect (which was a good thing!).  It was such a unique and amazing flavor plus a great decorative color. Love it.

I chose to make this for a dish to pass for a church dinner - and everyone loved it, including a fussy husband! The onions were omitted, with carrots substituted instead. The other substitution was 1/2 cup plain yogurt for the mayo, as the other reviewers suggested. My husband says 5/5. Nice flavor!

Great twist on traditional coleslaw!  I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg for some extra flavor.

This is wonderful, fast and fresh and delicious. I have made this a half dozen times already because we enjoy it so much. I made the recipe as is, though now that I've read the other reviews, I might try a few variations.

This slaw is not only easy, it's delicious and a refreshing take on the traditional coleslaw.  Make sure to choose mild onions and chop them pretty small.  I also added dried cranberries...yum!

We thought this was really good, and we're not huge coleslaw fans (I only made it because I had cabbage to use up and didn't know what else to make!) :)  I did add extra apple (1/2 of a green one, personal preference) and a little more cabbage just based on how thick the dressing appeared.  One thing to note-maybe this is obvious, but we ate it a few hours after it had been prepared, and the flavors hadn't blended quite as well as I would have liked yet.  We both thought that it was much better today!  (a day later)  I may put a little less mayo in next time, but that's just personal preference.  I also used plain green cabbage, and it tasted wonderful as well. Thanks for an easy recipe!

This is one of those recipes you will make over and over again for bbqs, potlucks, Wednesday night dinner. I sometimes will make mine with a high ratio of yogurt to mayo just to add bite to the recipe.

I've made this twice.  Didn't last long either time.  I grated the apples instead of dicing. Great way to use the recently harvested red cabbage from my garden and freshly picked apples.  Might add some grated carrots and celery next time for color.

This was excellent!  I used a bag of shredded green slaw instead of purple (it was what I had in the frig) and followed the rest of the recipe.  We liked it the first day better than the second.

This was great!  I made it for a bbq at my in-laws.  My MIL is VERY hard to please, and looked very skeptical about this dish.  And then she ended up keeping ALL of it.  I was happy b/c she is so picky, but I wanted to take some home! ;o)

The high ratings caught my eye so I decided to make this for a holiday lunch celebration at work. I made a recipe and 1/2--I used 1 yellow  onion instead of white because that is what I had on hand as well as gala apples.  I also added a  box of raisins (medium)and some  about 1/2 cup of leftover strawberry cranberry sauce.  I guess I liked it fruitier!  Not too keen on the taste of onion and will next time not add it.

so good. I didn't have enough mayo so I added a bit of half and half to the jar and shook it up to make the the dressing. It was a bit lighter I'm sure but the combo is really refreshing. The apples are not overpowering.

Sweet, tangy and delicious. I bumped down the mayo a bit (~2/3 cup) and it was still excellent. Make sure to properly salt and pepper. Yum!

I made this around noon today, and by the time we had it with dinner about 7 hours later, the flavors had melded quite nicely. I'm sure the leftovers will be even better tomorrow. The only thing I changed was to add a little more onion, as that's how we like it. Thanks, Starflower!

Don't be afraid to try this one!  This is excellent.  If you like cole slaw even a little bit, you'll love this recipe.  Don't skip the onion, and ANY crisp, flavorful apple will do - you don't need Fuji's.  You won't be sorry - everyone will love it!!!  Give it several hours to blend the flavors.

loved the apples in the slaw.  decided to go a little lighter with the mayo, and a little heavier with the lemon juice.  also added napa cabbage and shredded carrots.

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe! I have made this recipe several times and have made it with the listed ingredients, with apple cider vinegar (as I didn't have any lemon juice) and with green onions instead of regular onions - ALL with fantastic results. Thank you for a terific Slaw recipe, it is soooo good!

Unusual, but absolutely delicious and received rave reviews at two parties. So much prettier than a regular bowl of slaw as well. Last time, I used Granny Smith apples and they were great too. Enjoy.

I am reviewing the dressing only.  I really enjoyed the dressing.  I had run out of my store bought stuff and whipped this one up.  I used a prepackage cabbage salad, and added a bit of green onion.  I was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

Almost every reviewer gave this a 5 and my guy loved it so I will give it a 5 at his request. He really loved it.  I did not like this AT ALL!!  Many reviewers said they do not like coleslaw but loved this.  I love coleslaw and this does not taste anything like coleslaw so maybe that is why I had such a distaste for it.

Loved this salad! The dressing tasted very light and the whole thing was really easy to put together. I've made it twice now. Instead of chopping ingredients, I shredded fresh cabbage (resist the urge to use pre-shredded, bagged cabbage because it is often dry and flavorless) and slivered  the apple. The result was a tender, light tasting  salad that is very pretty.

Have made this several times, and I love it every time. Make sure it's a crunchy apple, is all I can recommend.

Replaced half the mayo with plain Greek yogurt and used honey instead of sugar.  Left out the onion only because I didn't have one.  And used 1 Granny Smith apple.  My family loved this slaw.  Served it with simple grilled pork chops.

I made it with fat free yogurth instead of mayo and added celery and red onion.  Turned out the chopping was tedious and Ended up using a processor which was a disaster!!! Baby food that tastes sour

Made this slaw tonight with pulled pork sandwiches. It was awesome! The apples were a great compliment to the pork and it looked beautiful on the plate. Also served our favorite Bush's baked beans. No chips or other potatoes needed in my opinion due to the crunch of the apples in the slaw. I did not change any of the ingredients, just made it by taste and site of the consistency that suits our family. Some users said that they added vinegar but i did not as i thought the onions gaved it just enough bite but did not overwhelm the sweetness of the apples if that makes any sense. If anyone is interested i made dr. Pepper pulled pork in my big dutch oven so it cooked all day and this slaw was the only thing i had to really prepare and it only took minutes to cut up and mix. Fabulous dinner was on the table within 30 minutes! Thank you for a new slaw recipe to have in my recipe box!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was so simple, fast, and good! I changed a few things; doubled the white onion, added a can of drained chicken (from Costco), used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 a squeezed lemon, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, and a hand full of raisins. I ate it on top of a bed of lettuce topped with silvered almonds and crasins, my husband and 18 month old ate it like a chicken salad sandwich. I also only used half of a small head of organic baby red cabbage and we still have more for tomorrow. My 10 year old daughter loved it and had thirds and my husband and 18 month old had seconds, and my picky 12 yer old daughter took onebite and turned her nose up at it.

Ended up eating a ton of it. Probably one of the better slaw's out there. Switched the milk out for a non-dairy alternative and left out most of the sugar because it seemed unnecessary.

Used 1/2 cup of light mayonnaise instead.  Really nice combination of flavors.

Made as written and liked it, but I wouldn't make it a lot.  But it was a great way to get red cabbage into the diet.

I only had one apple, it was a granny smith - so I diced it very finely so it would spread out further. Worked very well. We will have this again. Oh and I added finely grated carrot, lest the  King protest.
