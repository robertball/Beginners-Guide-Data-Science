FANTASTIC!!! Excellent for a warm summer night when you want to cool down. I was skeptical about mixing milk directly with vinegar in the dressing because I thought the milk would curdle, so I combined all the dressing ingredients *except* the milk, stirred it well, then added the milk. The dressing tasted just like what I've had at good Thai restaurants!!! I made one addition to the noodle mixture: fresh cilantro. The results were so fresh and yummy! I'm glad the recipe made a lot of noodle salad because I'm looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow.

I was a little disappointed.  I would completely change all the veggies, no cucumbers, and use extremely thin noodles.  Using speghetti just is too heavy.  The dressing isn't bad, but it lacks something.  I will try to modify this to get it to work.  I will let you know when I figure out the missing ingredients.

I substituted linguine for the udon noodles, and it turned out well.  I feel the texture of the bean sprouts detracted from the salad, so next time I'll leave those out. Otherwise, a very good, flavorful salad.

the presentation of this salad is very nice!  i think next time i would try another type of noodle...the udon noodles were a little too floury and bland for our taste.

This is a great recipe.  I added lots of vegetables to it (bean sprouts, pea pods, shredded carrots, diced celery) and it was a hit at the family party.  I also heated up the left overs the next night and had a hot pasta dish for dinner.  It was great cold and hot.

I LOVED this salad. My boyfriend "really liked it". He didn't love the whole udon noodles - works best if you cut them into bite-sized pieces. Also he requested more bean sprouts and that worked well when we tried it a second time. I also addes a tiny bit more peanut butter b/c I  love it! Next time I want to try it hot without the carrott and cucumber!

When I read the receipe I was so excited. I love Thai food, especially receipes with peanut butter. But....this salad was terrible. I spent all afternoon making it and wound up throwing the whole thing out!!

I made this over the weekend for a cookout and it was a big hit.  I used twice the amount of udon called for and I think only 1 package (8oz) would have been way too much sauce.  One other note - this is much more like a pasta salad than a green salad because it is a mound of saucy noodles on a bed of lettuce (at least the way it turned out for me.)

Very tasty noodle salad.  I substituted spaghetti for the Udon and it still tasted great.  Also added water chestnuts for more crunch.  Especially good on second day.  I added a touch more soy sauce on second day to maximize flavor.  I recommend trying this!

This is my favourite recipe!  I've made it for several parties and even asked my fiance to cook it on my birthday.  It's delicious and a great way to show friends that I don't eat twigs and leaves.  (I'm vegan - and soy milk is a great substitute for regular milk in this recipe.  Also, soba noodles rather than udon are an interesting variation.)

I followed the recipe as exactly as I could although I did have to do a little guess work here and there. I used unsalted old fashioned peanut butter and, although it didn't specify, I used unseasoned rice vinegar. My noodles were quite sticky so next time I will add a little sesame oil to them after I rinse them in cold water. Will also add a bit more red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit more. All in all, a very nice recipe with lovely flavor. Thank you.

This was good.  I liked the sauce the best.  Even though I don't usually use red pepper, I used it in the sauce and enjoyed the zing.  I used ramen noodles, rinsed and oiled, because our grocery store had not Udon.  I thought it worked okay.  Also added red bell pepper in place of carrots. Oh, and I also added thinly sliced cabbage(coleslaw mix). I thought it workded well- a good luncheon dish.

The is a very good salad, even my somewhat sceptical bf liked it.  I used rice vermicelli noodles instead of the udon and extra veggies like julienned red pepper, radishes, snow peas, Also added a little extra garlic and ginger.   Make this a meal by adding grilled chicken or beef.  Left out the red pepper flakes as I can't eat spicy food but next time I will have to add a wee bit give it some zig.  Excellent

I scaled the recipe to 10 servings for my bible study group and it worked very well. It is a very tasty salad and you can make it a hot as you like with the red pepper flakes which is good. I also used the linguine paste instead of the Undo noodles as it called for. I will for sure make this again.

Excellent, excellent!  I found it also works very well with the thin, translucent Thai rice noodles.  The peanut dressing is very tasty, and I think kids would like it; don't have any, can't say.

We didn't care for the peanut dressing or the "fat" noodles. I think that some of the other modifications mentioned might make it better, but still probably not something that I'd try again.

Excellent!  Loads of flavor.  I doubled the recipe, followed the directions exactly, using the Eden brand Udon noodles and served for a luncheon. It makes quite a bit. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It was a perfect combo with Cold Cantaloupe Soup. Thanks Jessica!

This was very good.  I doubled the noodles.  My udon noodles were already cooked and would not have served 6 - 8.  I don't know if I got something different than the recipe specified and that is why I had to double the noodles or what.  In any case, we enjoyed it.

I have to say.....I was so disappointed with this recipe! I cook a lot of Thai food, so I was excited to try a cold noodle salad. I might have used the wrong noodles, maybe that was the problem. I used clear Thai noodles that you use for Phad Thai. They got all pasty and sticky. The whole salad tasted like flour or rice. I don't know what I did wrong, but usually I know how to make a good salad!

the dressing for this is wonderful.  I added a bit more ginger to it though for a bit more bit and a little more red pepper for spice and omitted the udon noodles for the thinner stir fry noodles.  Tasty!!

yummo!  i was looking for something comparable to the thai noodle deli salad you can get at save-on or safeway or wherever.  i made a few changes ie veggies chopped smaller, no bean sprouts (kids just won't eat it if they're there), less cuke, added red pepper, chow mein noodles instead of udon.  but its the dressing that makes it!  this salad doesn't even make it to the bed of lettuce.
thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent and easy. Just a bit time consuming with regards to prep, but thankfully my food processor did most of the work.

It makes a TON - which is awesome because I'll have lunches for work for the next few days.  The package of Udon noodles I had was 10 ounces, but I used them all and still had a nice proportion with the sauce.  The instructions said to boil for 13 minutes (rather than 5), so I'd recommend checking the instructions on your package rather than relying on the ones in the recipe.

Also, my only additions were chopped cilantro and cooked shrimp. I also only added about half the mint it called for as I was worried it would be too powerful.

Hubby said, "This is restaurant quality."  That's one of the best compliments I can give this meal. Would like to try with grilled chicken next time.

I had never tried to make anything thai before and this turned out pretty good. I wanted a pasta salad for the weekend, so I made this and left out the lettuce. Used carb smart speg. noodles. Hubby said it needed a bit more "kick" so he added more soy sauce to his. I will try again. It was something new and fun.

I thought this recipe was lacking 3 key thai ingredients...lime juice, fresh cilantro and fresh basil, so I added them (1/2 cup each for a doubled recipe). I also added some red bell pepper for color and sweetness. I also think the key to this dish is tossing everything right before serving. I used thai rice noodles because I didn't have udon (too lazy to go shopping) and they worked out fine, but again, I wouldn't recommend tossing this head of time with anything but udon. Other noodles will get gummy.

I just made this for a potluck at work and it was a hit!  I added about 2 tbsp. of brown sugar and I was pretty liberal with the ginger.  It turned out great!

This was ok - I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the noodles (didn't have Udon - used linguine) but I thought it was too much. I would've liked to have had it saucier. Plus I only had 2 T of soy sauce but it really needed the 3 T. I ate it cold but my husband wanted it heated up without the lettuce. I'm not sure I'll make it again but it was good to try.

I used leftover Ramen noodles to make this for lunch today. I loved it Jessica and didn't change a thing. Thanks!

Made this for lunch and turned out well.  I personally did not care for it but my husband loved it.  Used half the recomended mint and would probably use less sesame oil next time my advice on the oil would be to add half and taste before adding more.

quite enjoyed this salad - I would cut the udon noodles in half and use less sprouts next time - the mint adds a refreshing taste!

I was broke and starving in the middle of the night last night and totally butchered this recipe using top ramen and leaving out all the vegetables and it still tasted great. I'll try it this way after I go shopping :)

I used different veggies (snow peas, carrots and red bell pepper) and almond milk instead of the dairy to make it vegan ... delicious!

This was great!!! We didn't have enough peanut butter so we added half almond butter and doubled the pepper flakes. Next time we will try coconut milk. Next time will be soon.

This is one of my favorite salads to make in the summer.  I love it!  It doesn't keep that well in the fridge, though.  The cucumbers get kind of icky and the salad goes watery.  Best to make it not long before you serve it.  Also, refridgerating can affect the consistency and make the dressing and noodles kind of stiff.  It still tastes good, it just doesn't look as pretty and is harder to serve.

I loved the dressing!!!! The best thai pasta salad I have ever had! I opted not to do the Romain lettuce. I added seseame seeds and cilantro. I did not use cucumbers but I used green bell peppers and peas. Yummy!!!

My husband and I were disappointed in this recipe...from the ingrediants, we thought we would love it! I made it as written and I think that it could use a lot of changes to make it a hit! But, it does have potential. Cilantro and basil added to the salad would be terrific and lime juice added to the dressing would be great as well...maybe even a little lime zest. Also, I think it would be better as just a noodle salad without the lettuce. I think I'll try this again with a few changes, but, as written I wouldn't suggest it. Thanks, anyway!

This sald was OK-it didn't live up to my expectations. It was definitely missing something. After making it for my family, I added some red pepper, ground ginger, and a terryaki dressing to give it a "kick" and some tang and it tasted a little better. It was just kind of bland. I'm taking the "improved" version to work for a pot luck tomorrow so we'll see what kind of reviews it gets.

I agree, this one's a keeper. I added 1/8 tsp of Splenda to the dressing and a bit more crushed red pepper. I also added thin slices of red peppper and snow peas to the salad. I also chose Peking Noodles (they don't need to be boiled) over Udon noodles. With these modifications, this salad was crisp 3 days later.  I mean it, it's a keeper!

I'm not an exact proportion kind of gal, and typically use recipes as a guide for what I have on hand. Having said that, this was really good - and we have a lot of experience with Thai food. I used rice noodles vs udon; and I added cilantro and sliced chicken breasts that I had simmered in Thai spices. We put extra red pepper flakes on the table, and lime juice too. I'd make this again, possibly even with zucchini "noodles".

This was good, but we felt it was missing "something."  Not sure what would give it the element is was missing, maybe a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar.  Will try it again.  Def needed salt added.

great salad! I used oat milk instead of cow milk, worked well. I left out the sprouts. More salt was also needed.

While I enjoyed the flavor of this dish, my guests would have preferred a less "earthy" taste.  Next time, I'd skip the sesame oil.  I also left out the ginger and the mint, but only because I'm not a fan.  Otherwise, this was a fun dish to serve and was a refreshing addition to our summer BBQ - a cold noodle salad on a hot afternoon is always a hit.

I thought this salad was great! I made a few changes, but nothing that made a big difference from the original recipe. I used soba noodles instead of udon and I used light coconut milk instead of regular milk. I also cut back on the amount of sesame oil - I find it too strong of a taste to use a whole tablespoon.

I had an issue with the amount of noodles.  I made the sauce ahead of time and chopped all the veg's.  However i used pre-cooked udon noodles 8oz and there was not enough compared to the amount of sauce and veg's.  The flavor was only okay.  I thought it was kind of weak.  Something was  missing.
