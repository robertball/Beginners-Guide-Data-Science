Didn't have pineapple juice so used white wine. Plus I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 11 min. Then sprinkled the dish with parsley as none of us like cilantro

I actually substituted dried peaches for apricots and the flavor was wonderful. 6 hours is way too long to cook, however. 3-4 hours on low would have been much better - my meat was a little tough. Will make again!

I used pork tenderloin that I had in the freezer. Turned out a "winner..." in our family. A little sweet. Next time I will use less pineappple juice.

I liked this, but halved the amounts of everything for 2 pork chops. This included halving a 6-in. cinnamon stick. I cooked it on High for 3 hrs, but lowered it to Low for the last half-hour. Our local bulk food store sells regular dried Turkish apricots as well as "pitted tart apricots", which is a more firm, candied-like apricot. I used both in the recipe, for comparison, and found that the regular apricots were almost mush by the end of the 3 hrs, while the tart apricots still had some firmness to them. I would use the tart ones again next time, or else toss some additional regular dried apricots in at least an hour before the end of the cooking time. Not a big fan of cilantro, so I omitted it.
