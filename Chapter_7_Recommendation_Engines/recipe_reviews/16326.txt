I baked two different kinds of pumpkin pies to compare...one was this recipe, and another recipe used Eagle's condenced milk. As a result, my boyfrind and I BOTH liked the pumpkin pie with this recipe! Using bourbon and crystalized ginger makes this pie very unique, and it remain moist, creamy and flavorful for days. This is our favorite pumpkin pie recipe now.

This is the best pumpkin pie I ever made.  The ginger and boubon give it such a zing! It was such a big hit at Thanksgiving, I have been asked to make it again for Christmas!

This is a simple pie to make that has good body and texture.  It could use a little more oomph of flavor, possibly by adding a bit more sugar and spice.  Added rum as a suggested alternative and it gave it a nice punch with the ginger.  Hubs absolutely loved it, so I'll be making it again.

Amazing flavor, especially with the crystallized ginger.  I use baharat instead of allspice just to give my baked goods a little different spin, and it goes perfectly here too.  If you parbake your crust, even for just 5 mins at 450, it will stay crisp under this custard. No other reviews seem to mention how long this needs to bake, so I will.  15 mins at 425, and then up to 1 hr 15 mins at 350 (no fan).  It takes quite a while for the custard to rise all over, then you know it’s cooked through.  Agreed with others, don’t use a deep dish.

I followed the recipe as written , but I used brandy instead because that's what I had . It's  the best pumpkin pie I have eaten, and it's even better the next day.

Made this pie according to the recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. It is delicious &easy to make. Ginger & bourbon gave it just the right amount of zip.

Love the filling.  But took another reviewer's advice and used deep dish...DONT DO THAT.  Not sure what she did maybe used a gigantic can of pumpkin, more than called for but I went by directions for filling to a tee, and used bourbon (my preference), and now have a giant gap which i will fill in with homemade whipped topping but not everyone likes that and really wanted a plain pumpkin pie that people could top however they wanted.   Lesson learned, not every reviewer knows what they are talking about when it comes to alterations.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  Made a double recipe.  But should have bought deep dish frozen pie crust instead of standard size as all of the filling did not fit in a regular pie crust.  Also, ate after cooling and it was too soft.  Chill in the fridge for few hours and the texture was much better.  I would serve the next day after chilling in the fridge.  Tastes great.  Tried rum in one and rye whiskey in the second.  Rye whiskey seems to meld better with the pumpkin taste than rum.  Will try cognac next time.  Very easy to make in a mixer.  Could leave out the chopped crystalized ginger as I am not sure it added anything to the flavor.

Love this! The crystallized ginger is a must! It softens in the baked custard and becomes these delicious chewy little nuggets. I subbed a decent brandy for the cognac and could taste it’s subtle flavor—wonderful!

I made the recipe as written. I didn't have any trouble finding the crystallized ginger and I'm glad I used it with the cognac! I made 2 of these pies for Thanksgiving and they were loved by all!

I have made this pie twice now in less than a week. The first time, I followed the recipe as written (except for the candied ginger cuz, I didn’t have any) using a refrigerated pie crust that I pre-baked. I used cognac. This turned out pretty well — my husband said he really liked it. I thought the cognac tasted stronger than I liked, so the second time I made this pie, I only used 2.5 Tbsp Cognac. I liked this version much better. My husband says to hold on to this recipe — it’s a keeper.

It was good.  I could not find candied chopped ginger anywhere and this is Orange County CA so that’s a hard to find item.  I used powdered ginger instead and courvoisier cognac. I still prefer pecan pie but the wife doesn’t like nuts.

I made this pie yesterday and ate some with whipped cream this morning and WOW, best pumpkin pie I ever tasted.  I didn't have any crystal ginger so I had to substitute and put a teaspoon of powdered ginger in the filling.  I usually do anyhow when I make pumpkin pie.   I also used a Pet-Ritz crust that I baked in advance.  This crust is just as delicious as homemade lard crust.

Response to Hungrylawyer 1141:
I love pumpkin anything, too! You could try using a sugar substitute  like Splenda instead of sugar in the pumpkin filling and in the whipped cream topping. Be aware that crystallized sugar is boiled in, then coated in, sugar and the alcohol has sugar content. Only you can decide if this recipe is OK for you or if a traditional pumpkin pie using Splenda would be a better choice.
