Nice change from the everyday. I took the advise of other reviewers and used about 1 cup of shredded carrot. I also doubled the brown rice. ( that rice sure had a nice flavor simmered in the vegetable broth ) I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Next time I will mix montary jack cheese and cheddar. My family enjoyed it, and will make it again

This was delicious!  I'm giving it five stars based on how good it would be even without my changes!

Omitted the mushrooms and carrots (didn't have any), chicken broth instead of veggie (what I had), probably doubled the cumin and used chili powder instead of the peppers (I'm a hot-spice wimp), and added a can of (well-drained) petite diced tomatoes.  I also halved the cheese -- 1/2 C mexican blend mixed in, then maybe 1/2 C on top -- to watch my middle!  (If anyone else tries with tomatoes, I made sure to spoon off the 1/2 C or so of liquid that they released.  It would have been soggy otherwise!)

My boyfriend LOVED IT, and I will make it again and again!  The best part is -- only $.60 a serving!!!

Very tasty...I'm already looking forward to having leftovers for lunch today!  My husband really, really loved this.  I liked it a lot as well, but would probably change up a few things in the future.  First, it's called a brown rice casserole, but I didn't think there was nearly enough rice.  I'd double the rice amount in the future.  The carrot is also lost...not enough for flavor or even really color.  I'd either added far more or omit entirely in the future.  The swiss was good, but I think I'd like to try this with cheddar instead or in addition.  Lastly, I think the chicken could be easily omitted to make this a vegetarian meal if so desired.  This recipe is great as written, and I think it'll stand up to customization as well so I'm excited to try it again with my own spin.  Thanks!

Very good. Tried it on the basis of the good reviews it received.  I needed a good casserole recipe to take to a friend's house.   Very pleased that I picked this recipe.   When my husband saw it cooking, he said "That's girl's food." (Because of all the veggies in it.)   However,  I gave him a dish of it and he really thought it was good. Tip:  If you use canned black beans,  be sure to rinse them thoroughly - otherwise the sauce that the beans are in can "discolor" the casserole.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

This recipe was absolutely scrumptious.  We did however spice it up a tad bit more by adding 1/4 cup minced garlic, and using the shredded "Mexican Four Cheese" packs that virtually all cheese makers sell instead of using Swiss, plus we added extra cumin and cayenne pepper, and put sour cream on the servings.  Aside from the cheese, this is not only a filling meal, but healthy.

My husband LOVES this!  And I have a harder time getting HIM to eat his veggies than I do with our 3 yr old.

I love the flavors, I love the blending of such different ingredients...and when I first saw it, I really thought it might be weird.

The only part I didn't like was the prep work.  I suppose if I used leftover chicken from another meal, that would considerably shorten my prep time.  But I tend to cook for EXACTLY who needs to eat, with very little leftovers.  And I really couldn't see there being 2 whole leftover breasts from any of our meals!

I am actually pregnant right now & have been directed by my midwives to have some sort of hearty meal with plenty of protein & complex carbs (yay for brown rice!) ready to eat after I deliver.  I am going to make this & freeze it.

I wish there were MORE stars to rate with!!  It is TRULY a fabulous blend of food groups & flavor!

This is very tasty. I did make a few modifications due to personal tastes, but kept pretty much the same ingredients. I used a lot more zucchini and mushrooms, left out the cheese entirely and cut back on the chicken. I then added the mixture to whole wheat tortillas with some salsa and made some healthy veggie/riec/bean burritos for lunch. Very good and it made lots. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't sure if I liked this at first, but it really grew on me the second day.  Added lots more vegetables than called for.  Also used the mexican cheese, as suggested by others.

This was really, really tasty. I subbed just over a cup of sliced bell peppers that I sauteed with the chicken instead of the zuchinni and mushrooms (no decent zuchinni around here in Jan. and I don't like mushrooms). I did closer to 2/3 cup of carrots and did a mix of cheddar and monteray jack cheeses. The end result was great and I will definitely make this again

I usually won't touch zucchini with a ten foot pole, however, in this recipe it was very good.  My husband, who dislikes rice, beans, and chicken really enjoyed this recipe!  I will definately be making it again.

This was a nice meal. My husband rated it with a "make it once every other month". I did not put mushrooms in because we do not care for them. I increased rice to one cup and made it with chicken stock. I also didn't have green chiles so I bumped up cayenne. I increased the carrots to about 3/4 cup and used cheddar instead. There is nothing wrong with the original...these changes just worked for our family and cupboards. :) Thanks!!

This was really easy. I left out the chicken to make it vegetarian, and added a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the can of green chiles. When I tasted, I decided to add a bit of taco seasoning as well. It was very filling, and I used the leftovers to make enchiladas the next day. Easy recipe to adapt!

I used instant brown rice and instead of using water to cook it in I used free range chicken broth and added salt, cumin, pumpkin spice, and chayann pepper. (I don't measure too much sorry). I chopped up chicken tenders and cooked in butter half way and added a can of black beans mostly drained and tossed in a can of chipotle tomatoes (drained the juice in the rice). tossed in some fresh spinach and shredded carrotes and seasoned with onion powder and cumin. tossed it all in a casserole dish and tossed and topped with colby jack shredded cheese. Came out very good

Ever read a recipe, reviews & think "That sounds good!" & as you're putting it together, change your tune competely?  Here's one.  It's not that it was bad, just not good.  Main reason I chose it was to use up some ingredients included in the dish.  It used them, but they still didn't get eaten. Too much trouble for such a less than average dish.

I was so excited to try this (even though, as a rule, I'm generally averse to "casseroles") and wanted to LOVE it, but just didn't.  Mr. LTH claimed to really like it at service, but *forgot* to take leftovers for lunch.  I liked it ok at service and thought maybe I'd enjoy the leftovers better for lunch/breakfast, but some are still languishing in our frig.  I'm not sure why we didn't love, though.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, simply subbing chicken broth for veggie and cheddar for swiss out of necessity.  The black beans were my favorite part!  This is def worth trying, as it is a nice change of pace for usual casserole/hot dishes!  THANKS for the recipe, LYSLW!

Terrific, easy, and pretty kid friendly. Great weeknight meal, especially if using left over chicken. When I'm cooking something like rice, I always make more than I need, then portion and freeze the extra. Makes it easier to put into something like this. The leftovers also made a great lunch the next day. The only thing I would do differently next time is use cheddar or a mexican cheese blend instead of swiss.

Nice, healthy recipe.  I added a can of mild Rotel  tomatoes with green Chilles and some fresh diced jalepenos to the sauteed veggies.  I also seasoned the chicken breast with southwest seasoning before I baked it.  Also, used a Mexican 4 cheese blend instead of Swiss.  It just seemed like a better choice.  My casserole had a nice spicy kick. Easy to make and not fussy.

I was surprised by how yummy this is!  I omitted the cheese and increased the brown rice to 1.5 cups cooked.  Our 13 month-old loved it!

Yummy!  I was looking for a way to use up some ingredients I had, and this recipe popped into my inbox.  I made a couple of changes based on available ingredients..I used a home-canned spiced soup starter (peas, carrots, onions, peppers) in place of the zucchini and I used chicken thighs  as it was what I had on hand.  I also used a rice mix (long-grain, wild, brown) whch added a nice bit of texture.  I served this to my family, fully expecting that at least some of them would pronounce it mediocre...but it was a unanimous hit!  I should have tripled the recipe instead of doubling it!  this seems like my favorite kind of recipe..the kind I can tinker with based on the ingredients at hand.

I was really skeptical about this recipe. Sometimes casseroles end up tasting and looking like a big blob of mush, but this was wonderful! I omitted the zucchini and mushrooms (I'm the only one in the house who likes zukes and none of us like mushrooms), and I subbed diced green peppers.  I increased the amount of shredded carrot like others suggested and I used chicken broth since that's what was in the cupboard. Oh, and I used cheddar and monterrey jack since we don't like swiss.  I served this with sour cream and salsa and tortilla chips.  I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I'll probably wrap them in a tortilla.  An easy dish that has lots of protein and good carbs that really tastes good!  Plus you can easily cater it to your personal taste. Thank you!  This will become part of my regular meal rotation.

I'll probably try this again at least one more time...Good taste but it was a little dry.  I'm not sure how that happened; maybe I cooked my chicken a little too long.  This is not a "quick" meal in my opinion, with all the things that need to be cooked separately before assembling. As such, I cooked my chicken and rice the night before.  Easy peasy...rice in the rice cooker and chicken in the slow cooker.  I doubled the amount of rice as per other reviews and used a 4 cheese italian blend instead of swiss.  I was also very liberal with my use of cumin and cayenne.  I also added some roasted garlic and tomatoes.  All told it is a healthy meal that is fairly easy with some pre-planning.  Thanks!

I didn't think this was going to be as good as it was!  We loved it!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis for the can of green chili peppers and I doubled the rice and broth.  Yummy healthy meal.

This is a keeper.  I made it without chicken for a vegetarian friend.  Of course I tried it out first.  It was a hit.  Like others, I used 4-cheese Mexican blend.  Instead of green chiles, I used 1/2 can store brand "mild"diced tomatoes and green chilis.

To be honest, I really didn't make this recipe but I was inspired by it and used what I had on hand.   I took 3 cups of cooked brown rice, 1 family sized can of drained black beans, and mixed them with onion and zucchini that I sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with cumin and garlic powder.  I put in a casserole pan and topped with cheese.  It was absolutely delicious.  So do this recipe even if you don't have everything on hand.

This was so good.  And it made great leftovers.  We added it to burritos the next day.  You could also add it to eggs in the morning and make a breakfast burrito.

Excellent.  My husband, who hates veggies, loved this recipe.  I used western style chili beans instead of black beans, omitted the mushrooms and served with sour cream and salsa.  It was a big hit at dinner tonight.

This is a decent starting recipe, but the resulting casserole is rather bland. Considering the recipe barely calls for seasoning or spices and uses mildly flavored ingredients, I'm confused by all the five star ratings. I'll make this again because it's a veggie-packed version of beans and rice. However, I'll definitely add a Mexican seasoning mix to it to kick up the flavor. And I might try it with chicken thighs instead of breasts to add even more flavor. 

The changes I made: I chopped raw chicken and boiled it shortly in broth before adding the brown rice to the pot, as I didn't have cooked chicken on hand. I doubled the brown rice to 2/3 cup and upped the broth to 1.5 cups to compensate. I kept the rice cooking time the same. I also doubled the amount of cumin, onion (1/3 cup just seemed too small to add flavor) and carrots (as other reviewers mentioned they couldn't taste the carrots; doubled I still couldn't taste the carrots). I used sharp cheddar cheese as I don't like swiss and because many reviewers said to try this substitution.

Yum! I keep looking for new reciepes to use the zucchini from our garden.  Wow the veggies in this dish!  I did not use the cayenne or chilis because I have little ones and didn't want to risk a turned up nose.  They LOVED it! I used Mexican blend cheese instead of swiss because I had it.  I had cooked a chicken in the crockpot yesterday so the meat was nice and juicy - highly recomend! Thanks for the recipe!

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I added a few things. I think it would have been delicious either way. I added a can of chipotle corn and some sun dried tomatoes. I also used Monterrey jack cheese instead of Swiss. I didn't use sour cream. My family loved this and I make it again.

I LOVE casserole recipes that do not have a "cream of something soup" as one of the main ingredients. This was outstanding. Followed recipe except as others suggested cooked 1 cup of brown rice and used pepperjack cheese. It not only tasted amazing, but looked beautiful! My husband usually rolls his eyes everytime I try a recipe that has whole wheat or brown rice as an ingredient, but he loved this. He even brought some to his mom (who used to be a cook) to try. I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you for sharing.

I loved this for a couple of reasons.  First, I had everything on hand except for carrot.  Second, my whole family cleaned their plates.  Third, I pureed the zucchini and green chilis so my picky husband got his veggies and didn't even know it.  Fourth, this is very versatile.  I tripled the rice, doubled the zucchini and mushrooms and did 1 1/2 times the chicken.  It was so easy and yummy.  Thanks for this recipe.

This is a fantastic dish. It's tasty, filling, not rediculously unhealthy AND it makes great leftovers. I substituted fresh green peppers for the canned chilis, and used colby and monteray jack cheese instead of swiss for the sake of my picky husband and it worked well.

[2/12] 2x brown rice, 1 cup carrots, omitted mushrooms because didn't have, boiled chicken thighs, and used cheddar cheese.  Good, though would probably reduce cheese to 1/2.

This got four "yums" from my family.  It was healthy, easy and delicious.  There were no leftovers here  ;-(  The only changes were that I used colby cheese instead of swiss and cooked the brown rice in chicken broth.  We call this "Burrito Bowl Casserole" since it reminds us of a burrito bowl from Chipotle.  Everyone ALWAYS asks for seconds of this dish.

This was great! Satisfying and complementary flavors. I only made minor changes: 1) used wild rice and 2) used a Mexican cheese blend of cheddar and and m. jack. Both worked well giving it a little kick and good texture. The next time I might add half a can of diced jalapenos. My husband added, "that's a keeper."

This is very tasty and has healthy ingredients. We made this for a large crew of construction volunteers for lunch. Some without chicken for the vegetarians. They all loved it and it became a regular item on the menu over a period of four months. It is quite cost effective and easy to make. My husband and I enjoy it for a weeknight dinner from time to time.

Very good.  I didn't have any mushrooms or carrots, so I replaced them with fresh tomatoes and a can of corn.  The cheese that gets mixed in, I used colby jack.  The cheese that goes on top, I used a fresh cheese that is made locally because I didn't have any colby jack left.  My boyfriend really liked it, esp. the zucchini.  I will  more rice next time.
Over all, it was very very good and I am going to be sharing this recipe with my friends and family.

This was delish!  I loved the combination of veggies and spices.  I tripled the rice, used cheddar cheese (that's what we had) and added more carrots as per other reviews.   When I served it I had chips and salsa so my husband poured that on and said it was even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

All in all this was a great starter recipe. I ended up not adding the mushrooms, onion or the zucchini but added a can of corn instead. I quadrupled the recipe since there are five people in my family. I left the spices alone and added not quite a teaspoon of salt to it and about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. I think that it needed a little more of salt and pepper than I added. I think that the cumin was awesome! Though I probably should have added some to the chicken as it was cooking. This is the first recipe in awhile in which I have not added garlic, but a tiny little bit probably could have been added. no more than an 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder though. The recipe was delicious! We substituted the Swiss cheese for a mixture of Cheddar and Mozzarella though Colby Jack would suffice (I didn't have any in stock). I give this recipe a thumbs up... good and healthy (if you don't overdo it on the cheese!) Thank you for sharing this recipe! My kid loved it!

I have made this recipe a number of different ways and it is always good.  I usually double the rice, add yellow squash, and double the carrots.  You can make this totally vegetarian and it's still so delicious and filling.

Very tasty casserole. I did make two substitutions based on ingredients on hand. I used chicken broth as I had an open quart, and cheddar/jack cheese instead of Swiss.

This was delicious, everyone liked it. I used chicken broth, cheddar cheese, and ham, and baby broccoli instead of zucchini. Because ham is saltier than chicken, I added only 1/2 tsp of salt. I left out the cayenne pepper and only added a tablespoon of green chillies. I thought that the proportions were spot on, but really this recipe is so versatile. I baked this in the 10" cast iron skillet that I used to saute everything.

This recipe ROCKS!! We are trying to go veggie, which is difficult for us after 30+ years of being omnivores. We loved this. I made a few changes, based on what we had on hand. Doubled the rice, broccoli instead of zucchini, pre-cooked lentils instead of chicken, mozzarella instead of Swiss. Holy YUM!

From previous reviews, it seems that this recipe  lends itself to an endless number of variations. Tonight I used it for the basis for a vegetarian Mexican casserole.  I followed the basic steps but used the following ingredients: ! cup brown rice cooked in chicken stock, 1 sm onion, 4 cloves garlic , chopped yellow and green pepper (one small each, could use any color), one chopped fresh jalapeno (we like spicy!) cumin, chili powder (1 tbsp)  zucchini, canned diced tomatoes,  black beans, 1 1/2 cups pepper jack cheese.  It was so good my husband and I ate almost all but one modest serving of it.  Thankfully, it's reasonably healthy.      Next time I'm going to go in a different direction, with brown rick, chicken, onions and garlic, zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, cannelli beans, tarragon or sage, and gruyere cheese.  But I'll definitely be coming back to the one we devoured tonight--it's a keeper!

This recipe is awesome!  I skipped the chili peppers, cooked the rice in chicken broth, added a can of corn and used cheddar cheese.  Excellent flavor!!

This is delicious and healthy.  I think you could add or subtract quantities as desired and still have a nice casserole.

I enjoyed how healthy and yummy this was.  My husband hates black beans, but he still liked this.  This recipe is easy to tweek to your liking, adding more or less vegetables.  Will make again

This is a solid recipe and may be great for those who like milder flavours. We found it too bland for us. Next time I would add some kind of enchalada sauce and maybe some red peppers/garlic.

I added 2/3 rice, more onion, carrot, strained diced tomatoes, and a couple of garlic cloves, as well as cheddar cheese. This was delicious, I didn't anticipate it to turn out so amazing! Will definitely make it again.

There are a lot of healthy ingredients in here and it tastes great!  The little amount that was left I used as breakfast the next day and it was even better!  I will definately be making this again.  Even my kids liked it.  Made it exactly as written!

Very disappointing. With all the veggies & cheese I was expecting more.  Very bland even though I more than doubled the spices & was very heavy with the cayenne pepper.  It just lacked something.  However Hubby thought it was good.  The most redeeming quality of this dish is that I took the leftovers & made enchildas with them as suggested by another reviewer.  As enchiladas they were better.  I doubt this will be on my "keep" list.

Very good.  Made with about an extra cup of zucchini & an extra cup of shreded carrots, and used spicy jalapeno beans.  Next time, I will try making it with chicken breast halves added when I put it in the oven (not boneless) to make it a more hearty meal.

FANTASTIC! I too added a 1 cup of carrots, 1 cup mushrooms and 1 cup rice. Next time I might try black eyed peas. Omit the salt, the cheese and veg. broth are plenty salty.

I neither disliked or liked this dish.  Something about the dish didn't taste like it belonged, or meshed well or something.  I have a similar dish that we call quesadilla casserole from mccormick and it is much better than this.  I would suggest going to your local spice aisle and get mccormick's recipe packet(with pre-measured spices included) for quesadilla casserole instead.

I loved this recipe!  Aside from making some slight variations,such as, Adding pepper/jack cheese to the mixture and topping it off with cheddar/jack and substituting chili powder and paprika for the cayenne pepper.  The most beneficial advice I can give is; to pound (tenderize) the chicken to a 1/2" thickness before cooking it.  And I also chose to peel the zucchini before quartering it and chopping it up.  Overall I am very impressed with this recipe and would like to thank LYSLW for the inspiration.

I made this mainly for my one-year-old who eats like a bird, so I am always looking for recipes that include the most amount of food groups. I doubled the carrots, zucchini, onion and brown rice and was able to freeze half for future meals for her. As for my husband and I, it was very bland, so we each added salsa on top. Would make again, but should be served as a side because it's not very exciting.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the rice, used 1 cup of carrots, used the preshredded mexiccan 4 cheese pack (light), and I also used the larger can of black beans.   My husband loved it so much, will definitely become a staple in this house!

This was good.  I don't typically like casseroles, so it was nice to find something I would eat!  I added a lot more rice (used 1 C dry) and more carrots (1 C shredded).  I also used a bit of cayenne pepper instead of the green chiles (didn't have any on hand) and cheddar instead of swiss. I mixed part of the cheese into the casserole and the rest I put on top.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder as well. 

This will go onto our regular menu plans, I think!

Delicous! A great combination of tastes and textures. I doubled the rice and add a tiny bit of red pepper with the veggies,  and separated into two casseroles, one for my non-chicken eating daughter who also won't eat mushrooms - I just split up the veggies before adding the mushrooms and chicken. Both casseroles turned out awesome.  I used a mixture of swiss and low-fat cheddar for the cheese.

Made this and it was a huge amount so froze it after we ate on it.   When it was thawed in micro....it still tasted fresh and you would never know it was frozen.  This is a keeper.   Next time add more brocolli and more beans....as a lot of rice in this casserole.

This was so yummy!  It doesn't seem like it would be full of flavour, but it is.  I had to make a couple of changes because I did not have certain ingredients.  I chopped half of a canned adoboe chile in sauce in place of green chilies (which gives it a bit of a bite!)  and I used monterey Jack cheese instead of swiss.  The only thing I found was there was not quite enough liquid for the rice, next time I will do in the rice cooker, comes out perfect every time.  I will make this again, thanks.

WE LOVE THIS!  The only change I made was doubling the rice (and vegetable broth).  I like to follow the recipes to a tee (almost) and then adjust from there.  I will make this again and will add an extra zucchini and more mushrooms, just because we love them.  Thanks for a great healthy recipe!

As per the suggestions of others, I doubled the rice (and the broth), and I used sharp cheddar instead of Swiss. For the chicken, I used a package of pre-cooked, grilled, refrigerated chicken strips - I cut them into tiny pieces (almost shredded), and I did not need to add them to the pan when I sauteed the veggies. I omitted the carrots and used a mixture of bell pepper, zuccini, and mushrooms. I meant to add about a cup of frozen corn, but I forgot about it. (Next time I will use bell pepper, mushrooms, and corn for the veggies). I also added much more cumin than this recipe called for, some chili powder, dried cilantro, and cayenne. None of the spices were overpowering. I thought the spices would blend better with the rice, so I added them to it while it was simmering. I served this dish with salsa, Frank's Red Hot Sauce, sour cream, and tortilla chips. Delicious!

Delicious! Very easy. I added some chopped garlic, and instead of just green chili's I used Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chili's. I also used cheddar instead of swiss.

This is very good. Did make a couple changes to it. Didn't use mushroom because of allergies. Used a tsp of Chili powder instead of cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt. Also used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Served with tortilla chips.

Great recipe I too doubled the amount of carrot and rice, and I used a cheddar/jack cheese. Definitely adding this to my recipe box!

Delicious...I doubled everything since the recipe seemed a bit small and I'm glad I did!  The flavor was just right. I didn't have any carrots on hand but added some red pepper with the onions and mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this the first time I ate it, but oh does it improve with age. I ate the last leftover today, 2 days after it was made and boy was it good. My son ate a full plate of it last night and also seemed to enjoy it more the second go around.

Good flavor but dry and crumbly. So dry it fell of the fork!  It needs a sauce to hold the ingredients together.

This was delicious....with quite a few variations. I decided to go with a southwestern theme by using yellow peppers and corn instead of zucchin-mushrooms/carrots. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil (olive oil becomes a carcinogen when cooked), doubled the rice, doubled the onion, added a large clove of garlic, cut up 2 fresh serrano chiles instead of the canned chiles, and used a jack/chedder combo instead of swiss. I didn't measure the cheese, but I'm sure I used more than 2 cups. But hey, I added more rice, so I had too.

Very nice filling, nutritious comfort food. I used 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tbsp. cayenne with very little salt. I added about 1/2 cup frozen corn and replace the peppers with 1/4 cup pickled pepper rings. Served it with grilled tomato wedges, which was a very nice side. Next time I'd simmer the chicken and veggies with spices over the BBQ to give it a different flavour and make the house not be quite as aromatic.

Very yummy! Finally a casserole that is good for you! I have made this several times now - I don't add the mushrooms, sometimes add broccoli instead of zucchini, and cooked diced potatoes instead of rice. It is a really flexible recipe. The green chilies make it, I think.

Made as directed and this was bland.  Really, really, really bland.  Adding more pepper gave it a bit of a kick, but it lacked any depth of flavor. It seems like a nice healthy starting recipe, though. I just need to figure out a way to spice it up and add some complexity before I would consider making again.

easy, tasty , but as with the others I did tweak it a bit, I only used one chicken breast, steam in the bag browm rice. I used tex-mex cheese ,only about a cup and a half and chili powder instead of cumin, This is a keeper,next time will double the mushrooms. The green chiilis make this dish perfect.

I felt that this was a lot of work for not very much flavor. Maybe I did something wrong but next time I will up the seasoning. Also, the zucchini was over cooked so I will add it right before I put it in the oven instead of cooking it before hand. Thank you for the recipe!!

Very good recipe!! I didn't have any zucchini, so I substituted it with asparagus and 1/2 a green pepper and used tex mex cheese instead of the swiss cheese, and it turned out great! My husband and I really enjoyed it! Definately will make again!

This was such a hit in my house!  I left out the zucchini and mushrooms, but added yellow and orange bell pepper instead because that's what I had.  It seemed to be taking on a Mexican flavor, so I altered the seasonings with extra cumin, red pepper flakes and garlic.  I topped it with sharp cheddar and served with salsa, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Love the basic idea, I bet you could make this casserole 10 different ways and it would be great every time!

This is wonderful and healthy!  My 2 and 4 yr old children devour this dish.  It is so easy, I make it the night before and then pop it in the oven after work.  I have used variations such as more rice, less cheese, added carrots, celery, etc. and it is always good.  I have used both store bought rotisserie chicken and canned chicken instead of cooking chicken breast and it is so easy. I have also made it with cheddar. Very good recipe base that is hard to mess up and always delicious!

This is a good casserole. I doubled the rice, added a tsp of chili powder and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss and reduced it to one cup. Next time I'll add a can of drained tomatoes and some diced peppers to get more veggies in it.

I love it.  This is a recipe that doesn't really need measurements.  Just throw everything in, it's going to be good.  I used a lot more rice - probably a cup - and cooked it in the rice cooker with chicken broth.  Used two jalapenos instead of the canned chiles because my jalapeno plant has gone wild this summer.  Put the jalapenos, onion, and a huge clove of garlic together in a chopper and then sauteed those with the chicken, then added the other veggies in.  Cut the cheese by probably half, and used a mexican cheese mix.  I love how delicious AND healthy this is. ** 2/21/11: Just wanted to add that my sister in law, who is a personal trainer, gives my version of this recipe to her clients and they love it! It really is a very nutritious, well-rounded meal.

I LOVED this recipe.  I did, as mentioned by other users, upped the spices, and switched the swiss cheese to cheddar but wow!  It was so good.  I will certainly be adding this to my dinner repertoire.  In the future it's the sort of thing that I think if I had chicken breasts some other night of the week I might make two extra just to have them for this later on in the week.  It really wasn't that big a deal though to toss two chicken breasts in the oven for half an hour, just a matter of time management.

This is wonderful with some alterations.  I doubled the rice, 1 C carrot, at least 2 zucchini, omitted the mushrooms, used Mexican cheese and added 2 C salsa.  Everyone loved this and asked for the recipe.

Mmm, good!  I didn't have just green chilies,  but did have a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, so I used that(drained).  I didn't have Swiss cheese either, so used colby jack instead.  Oh geez, I guess I subbed chicken broth for the vegetable broth, too.  Anyways, whatever I did, it turned out wonderfully and it's a keeper.

I added extra rice to the recipe, as per other reviewers' suggestion, but I found that the casserole didn't want to hold together and was very dry.  I also didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I used chili powder instead.  There wasn't a lot of flavor as a result.  I think that when I try this again (and it's worth another shot) I will add a can of Ro-Tel or diced tomatoes.  It seemed to me that this recipe was screaming for some tomatoes.  Overall, a yummy combination of flavors.

Nice casserole.  Being a vegetarian, I'm always looking for hearty dishes like this. I followed others suggestions and used more than 1/3 cup of rice. This will be a repeat in my kitchen!

This was excellent and it turned out much better than anticipated.  We are trying to eat healthier and my husband said he could eat this every night.  Changes I made were to add garlic and a diced jalapeno in with the onion.  I left out the mushrooms (hubby won't eat them) and added yellow squash and chopped spinich and a couple tablespoons cilantro.  I also used reduced fat mexican cheese blend instead of the swiss.  This is and excellent base recipe to mix and match with what you like.  Thank you!

I was skeptical at first, but this was really good!  I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss and pinto beans instead of black beans.  Next time, I'll increase the amount of veggies.

My ENTIRE family had seconds including the kids! They re-named it, "I can't Believe it Tastes Good!" casserole. I used cheddar instead of swiss and left out the chicken, adding more mushrooms and carrots. I'm still amazed we loved this so much. As meat eaters, we were pleasantly surprised!

Excellent recipe to fill the house with a delicious aroma.  All of my family enjoyed it (even the 2 year old).

This was not as good as I had expected, given the reviews. Me and my family were a bit disappointed. In reading the ingredients I expected more flavor but it lacked depth and nothing really stood out.

Very good!  Used two cans of hot chiles so very spicy.  Would only use one hot next time.  Was better the next day!

This was delicious! The only changes I made were to add fresh garlic and extra shredded cheese. It was a hit and will be added to the regular recipe cycle!

Yummy!  a little time consuming.  Add garlic, 1 clove, with onion. Use Mexican, jack or cheddar cheese combo. Use about 1c carrot.

I was skeptical about this one, not for myself, but for getting my family to eat it. So instead of slicing the zucchini, I grated it, which hid it well so they didn't even know it was there. My youngest child liked it so much she asked for seconds!  That was quite a feat not just because of the hidden zucchini but she usually refuses to even trying anything with beans in it. Very impressed!. I used mozzarella because it's what I had on hand, cooked my own black beans from dried and made a 2:1 mix of brown rice and quinoa of which I used about 1.5 cups (cooked). This is a winner!

I do not generally leave bad ratings, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why this recipe is rated so highly.  This recipe might be an ok base for something better, that is about all it is, at best.  NOTE:  I DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS RECIPE - MADE IT AS IS.  As is, this recipe is bland and not worth all of the pans it takes to make it.  It is relaltively healthy, I will give it that.  It needs some serious kick.. I travel quite a bit for work and my husband (the leftover king when I am out of town) does not even want the leftovers.

Wonderful recipe, although the flavors are pretty bland, so I've been experimenting with ways to spice it up a bit. Still bland, but still good! Modifications tried so far: fresh jalapeños, cilantro, grill the chicken, grill the veggies, 2% Mexican cheese blend instead of swiss. I've never added the carrots, and as I've upped the jalapeños, I've omitted the cayenne. I always use more rice than called for. Bottom line: inexpensive and healthy dinner option.

Based on other reviewers, I doubled the rice, mushrooms, and onions. I omitted the chicken (we're vegetarian) and used cheddar instead of Swiss. I also added about 1/2 cup of salsa. I think without this, it may have been dry? Regardless it added nice flavor. I plan to make this dish regularly.

I did not have the vegetable broth, black beans, or zucchini.  So I substituted chicken broth and a can of pinto beans and omitted the zucchini.  It was still outstanding!  This will be a regular in our house.

Wow! I'd been eyeing this awhile, thinking it would be good but I'm really pleased with just how good it turned out. I had some shitakis, a cuke, and some teriyaki chicken to use up, so I went with this and am glad I did. I left out the carrot, and used plain brown rice and it still had a really nice flavor even without the rice cooked in stock. Definitely going into the rotation.

I was searching for recipes under the indredient list b/c i had some leftover rice and black beans from a catered office lunch and came upon this recipe and had a lot of reviews and decided to try it!!  It was delicious!!!  I did however make a few changes because my rice was already cooked, so it would be good to use up any leftover rice and veggies.  
I sauteed the onion and carrots in the oil till almost done then added the zucchini & mushrooms.  When the mushrooms were almost done i added all the other indredients and mixed.  I felt like it needed a little more flavor so i added about 1/2 tsp or more chipotle chili powder & about 1/2 cup of salsa.  PS the more cheese the better but if you are trying to keep it healthy oh well :)  i also topped with a little sourcream.

I really enjoyed this dish. Kiddos werent crazy about it, but I think cutting the veggies a little smaller next time will make it easier/more likely for them to eat. Used a mixed cheese from TJ's and only about half. Added double the carrots, more mushrooms, and garlic. Left out green chiles. Served with Salsa, sour cream, and chopped olives..pretty yummy!

Very flexible menu that you can customize depending upon seasonal availability.  Like most others I used double the brown rice to have left overs.  Grated a couple of carrots and added brussels sprout leaves before into the final mix.  The leaves gave a nice crunchy texture.  Used cremini mushrooms as they are more flavorful and not as expensive as portobello.  Next time I might julienne some bell peppers or even a jalapeno.  Family loved it.

Double (or maybe even tripled) the rice, vegetables, & chile. Substituted red pepper for zucchini, shrimp for chicken. Only used 1/2 the cheese (and used Cheddar instead). AMAZING flavor!

Very wonderful but with some changes. My family very much dislikes mushrooms,zucchini, and carrots so I left those out. I used 1 1/2 tsp Cumin and 1 tsp Cayenne because my family LOVES both. I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss but I'd love to try it with mozzarella. My 5 yr old and 2 yr old both hate chicken and they both asked for 2nd's and 3rd's!

It was an interesting textural combination to have the zucchini, and it's nice to get more veggies in. I would make it again.

This was great- and very healthy! I took the advice of others and used 1 cup  carrots (instead of 1/3), used reduced fat mexican blend cheese, and used 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (I like things spicy!).  And to decrease the prep time- I used microwave brown rice instead of making brown rice with vegetable broth.  It was great and I'll make it again!

WOW! My family loves this casserole. We made a few adjustments. We don't like the flavor of chiles so I added a half can of diced tomatoes. Also sauted fresh garlic with the onion and added fresh cilantro after baking. It is healthy and filling.

I did ingredient search for zucchini and found this recipe. It sounded healthy and good. So I tried it. My husband liked it and I could taste it even though my taste buds are way off due to chemotherapy. The changes I made was I thinly sliced baby carrots instead of shredded. I thought I could taste them better and I did taste them a bit. I didn't have Swiss cheese so used chedder. And I only put a sprinkle of Cayenne because I can't eat spicy at this time.

Pretty good.  Left out peppers and mushrooms (personal taste).  Definitely had to double rice.  Should have added a little more cumin.  Used monterrey jack and cheddar instead of swiss.

I love eating hearty meals that are also healthy! This was packed full of nutrition and taste.  Next time I would substitue part skim swiss cheese to cut down on fat calories and use slightly less of it.
This will be a regular in our home.  Just like another reviewer stated... I cannot wait for leftovers!

My family thought this was great!   I doubled recipe and at the end only added green chiles to the adult half, and left the children's half without.   Everyone was happy.   Although I could have gone with even more spice in the adult portion.

This is yummy stuff.  Did as other folks suggested.  I doubled the amount of rice, used cheddar cheese.  The leftovers are great for lunch the next day in a flour tortilla with shredded lettuce.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some left over chicken and this was terrific.  To lessen the prep time I purchased the pre-cut match stick carrots and increased the carrots to 1-1/4 cup.  As suggested, I added a can of diced tomatoes (drained), added a bit more rice and used mexican cheese.  I put the left over's in the freezer for another night.  I will be making this recipe again for sure.  Thank you for submitting this great recipe.

Thank you for this very tasty recipeé  It is, indeed, a keeper.  I used Parmesano Reggiano for cheese, and a homemade blend of taco seasoning.  That really hit the spot!

This dish was delicious!  I adapted it a little by cutting out the mushrooms (I don't like them), decreasing the cheese to 1 1/2 cups, increasing the cumin and carrots, and adding a can of creamed corn.  I think the corn caused it to be a little liquidy, but it was still delicious served with tortilla chips.  I will definitely make this again, maybe with frozen/canned corn instead of creamed corn.

I used green bell pepper instead of green chile peppers, used sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss and added a few tablespoons of Trader Joe's black bean and corn salsa to give it a little kick.  This was SO good and I can see where you could use many different vegetables in it.  Will definitely make again.

This is delicious!  Some changes: I used 1 cup of rice (white rice because that's what I had in the house) and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I doubled the carrots, onions and cumin. I also threw in a clove of chopped garlic with the chicken and zucchini.  Next time I may use 2 cans of black beans since I made more rice.  I normally don't like zucchini but loved it in this! Healthy and tasty!

Delicious!  I took other reviewers suggestions and used a cup of rice.  I put 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin into the broth to give the rice more flavor.  Word to the wise follow the directions on the rice rather than the recipe.  I put my rice in with the broth before boiling the broth and got mushy rice.  I re-cooked following the directions on the rice bag which said to boil the water/broth before adding the rice and got perfectly cooked rice.  I also added cilantro since rice, black beans and cumin are just begging for fresh cilantro!  I used fat free cheddar but honestly, it was totally unneccesary.  It was better without it.  I ommitted the chicken to save calories.  Next time I will skip the cheese and the extra baking and just add the chicken back in.  4 points on Weight Watcher per serving for anyone interested.

Excellent...vary flavorful. This time I omitted the chicken, doubled the rice and carrots, and added some chopped tomato and 1 clove garlic for a vegetarian version. Also used cheddar instead of swiss and liked that better.

We really enjoyed this dish. Will definitely make again but next time, I think I will use pepper jack cheese to give it a little more flavor. We topped with salsa and a little sour cream. As easy as this dish was to put together, I have a feeling it will become a staple in our house.

Thought this was an excellent recipe! Loved by all in the house including picky DH and 3 yr old DS. It will definitely become a staple and I will probably start to double the recipe to freeze. Took others advice and doubled the rice and used extra carrots. Also, did not have cumin, but didnt' feel it was lacking. I cooked my chicken in Adobo in the oven, so that may have helped. Also did not use swiss, but an italian cheese mix that I had on hand. Probably used less cheese than it called for just to help our middles, but still thought this was great! Too bad hubby beat me to the leftovers the next day grrr

I cannot say how much i LOVE making thsi casserole.  I've made it many times and each time I try something a little different.  I usually put in as many veggies as I can: mushrooms, frozen brocoli, cauliflower, etc., carrota and of course zuchini.  It tastes great with any of these cheeses:  Monterrey, Mozarella, Cheddar, but I like it most with the Mexican Blend.  I also sometimes use White (northern beans) and it tastes GREAT.  Great leftovers, too!

I didn't use green chile peppers because I didn't have any on hand and instead of swiss cheese I used a mexican blend shredded cheese. I liked it but my family didn't.  I'm giving 4 stars because it wasn't outstanding but I'd make it again if at least one person in my family had eaten from it.

Fun recipe but I did change it up quite a bit.  Like others said it didn't seem to have enough rice so I used a full cup (uncooked).  I also omitted the mushrooms and carrots but added yellow summer squash, corn, a couple diced tomatoes, black olives, some chopped cilantro and sprinkled crushed tortilla chips on top with the cheese.  I also increased the cumin to closer to 2 tsp and used colby jack instead of swiss (swiss seems an odd choice for this recipe).  My husband and daughter loved it.

Great casserole; this is a pretty healthy meal.  Made it ahead of time and cooked it the next day - what a relaxing way to entertain.  Added  one more chicken breast, another small zucchini, 1 C carrot, can of stewed tomatoes (drained), and doubled the cumin; no mushrooms.  This would not serve 8 - maybe 6.  I had my husband and two of his friends for dinner - they all enjoyed it.

This was a delicious change from the usual black bean dishes I cook.  The combination of flavors really works!  My husband is on a low-cholesterol diet, so I cut the amount of cheese in half and substituted a dollop of reduced fat sour cream on top.  I also doubled the veggies and black beans and eliminated the chicken.

this was so good. i also put it on a tortilla with salsa and sour cream  and ate it like a fajita. delicious! i didnt see much need for baking it, cooked everything first then bake long enough for the cheese to melt, or just sprinkle on top. i also didnt need to boil the rice for 45 minutes, i believe mine was tender at 30.i also added more rice and black beans, more zuccini. and no carrotts. so delicious!

Made it without the cheese or cayenne, added crushed garlic and used red bell pepper in place of zucchini. With some pico and sour cream for condiments, this was delish. Looking forward to leftovers!

Fantastic!  I can't imagine this recipe with anything but cheddar.  Lowfat cheese makes this dish an outstanding healthy option for our family! Try serving with a spoonful of salsa and dollop of fat free sour cream.

very yummy and easy! I'm vegetarian so I did mushrooms, onions, carrots and green pepper. the great thing about this recipe is you can tweak the ingredient levels for what you want. I doubled the rice, trippled the carrots and mushrooms and halved the cheese. Will be a great dish to have all week long.

I made a slightly different version of this recipe, because I didn't have all of the ingredients.  Here are my changes, based on what I had on hand:  I substituted some frozen broccoli florets for the zucchini, and a red bell pepper for the canned green chiles.  I omitted the mushrooms (didn't have) and the chicken (to make it a vegetarian meal).  Instead of Swiss cheese, I combined what I had in my cheese drawer, which was mozzarella, Mexican blend, and even some crumbled feta.    It all blended together wonderfully, and made a very colorful and tasty meal!  I'm pleased with the flexibility of the recipe, and the number of veggies packed into it, plus the whole grains from the brown rice and fiber from the black beans.  I will definitely make this a part of my regular recipe rotation.

This recipe turned out great.  I used my food processor to shred the onion, carrots and zucchini. It is one of those recipes that you know is a healthy meal.

I followed the instructions and it came out pretty well, except the shredded carrots were still a little crunchy.  It threw off the texture of the dish.  Other than that it was good.  It will be better warmed up (carrots cooked through more).

When I saw this recipe, I just was not sure about the taste. I have way too much brown rice from a gumbo recipe and I just needed to use it up. I was quite surprised with the results. I doubled up on all the veggies and it tasted great.

Good for a little something different. I made it without chicken, added rice and some veggies...basically used it as a guideline. Would be good as a taco filling.

This is a great casserole, very tasty.  The first time I made it, I took the other reviewers' advice and double the rice.  It turned out wonderfully.  The second time I made it, I forgot to double the rice...it was still yummy. Brown rice and black beans  -- so good for you.  And it's all held together with some gooey cheese.  What more can you ask for?

5 stars because this is quick, easy, and cheap, as well as nutricious,versatile, and DELICIOUS! I didn't have any zucchini, so I used half a box of frozen chopped spinach, and no swiss, so I used the cheddar I had on hand. My picky children didn't pick anything out!

Wow! This is an awesome dish. Chuck full of all the things we are 'supposed' to eat and delicious at the same time! I'll be making this regularly. I did swap red bell pepper for the carrots and extra sharp cheddar for the swiss. I also added a clove of minced garlic and doubled the rice.

I love this recipe so much, I make it at least once a week and take the leftovers for lunch.  Even my 3-yr-old son likes it, and he doesn't like healthy stuff.  

The only suggestion I have is use Cheddar and/or Parmesan cheese instead of Swiss.  I also added black olives and frozen peas.

I increased the vegetables as others suggested, added more cumin, kept the rice to the amount shown, used a Mexican cheese blend instead of swiss, then finished the dish with some crushed tortilla chips added when I took the foil off.  Kids and husband loved it!  Will make again (and again)

This dish is simply delicious! I particulaly love the fact that it is such a healthy meal. As other reviewers have done, I used (and definitely recommend) cheddar cheese, we found it really complimented the flavors whereas swiss (the one time we used it) seemed to overpower them. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. We changed it up a bit and made it into burritos instead of casserole. I also added cilantro, cayenne peppper, green pepper, and jalapinos. I did not bake it but mixed the veg, beans, and rice together then filled tortillas and topped them with cheese. Very tasty.

This was a fun way to use black beans. Instead of carrots I put in some summer squash and I used sharp chedder cheese instead of swiss. I'd say it makes a better lunch than dinner.

I thought this was just okay, but my brother thought it was great so I gave it 4 stars instead of three.  I made more rice to serve on the side.  Left out the carrots.  Used a mexican blend cheese instead of swiss.  My brother added hot sauce as a condiment.  This would make a good dinner for a family because it's very filling.

This recipe is very unique and my husband and I loved it.  It's kind of unusual on the first bite or two, but really grows on you after that.  I would say it is probably not for everyone, though as it has a very distinctive blend of flavors.  After reading the reviews, I did leave out the carrots.  It is a fair amount of work, but worth it if you aren't in a hurry or can make it up ahead of time.

This is a keeper.  We tried it as is, and it was really good, but we're going to add some chedder cheese next time, as well as more rice for burritos.

This was very good.  I left the chicken out and used 1/2C of rice and added a whole C of carrots instead.  To cut calories I used 1/2 fat free cheddar and 1/2 regular cheddar.  I also added a couple of T of low fat sour cream to the rice mixture before baking.  No way does this make 8 servings-4 at the most.

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe but was pleasantly surprised.  It just seems like an odd mix of ingredients and I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was sort of like a rice bowl with a slightly Mexican flavor (from the chiles and cumin.)  I doubled the rice, mushrooms, and carrots and I'm glad I did or it would have been too heavy on the zucchini.  I also used cheddar cheese because I don't like swiss.  I'm not sure I'll make this on a regular rotation, but it was tasty.

Both my boyfriend and I were extremely impressed with the recipe.  The ingredients were not what we usually eat, so we were fairly skeptical, but it was a pleasant surprise.  We will definitely make this again, and often!

Good, not great.  I chopped up a few jalepenos instead of chilis, added a chopped clove of garlic while sauteeing, and added 2 Tbsp sour cream to the casserole.  It was a little dry.

I love this combo and have made it several times.  My husband dislikes swiss, so we use provolone instead, and I definitely added more carrots (one cup coarse grated) to the mix.  Used some green jalepeno sauce vs the peppers, and it really had a wonderful taste with the smokey cumin.  yum!  Thanks for sharing.

Although this recipe doesn't look that appetizing, it tasted great!  My husband compared it to Rubio's Chicken & Rice Bowls.  I added more rice and swiss cheese than recommended.  I am also in agreement that not enough carrots were in this recipe to be significant.  Either add more or leave them out.  This is super good and nutritious and very flexible as a vegitarian dish too! Great for leftovers the next day.  The tortilla wrap is a great idea for lunches!  I used Trader Joe's 'Brown Rice Medley' and made the rice a day in advance so the casserole was simple to put together the day we ate it.

My whole family loved this casserole. My mom asked for the recipe and I have emailed it to my sis-in-law. Just be careful not to use to much cayenne. If you do just add some sour cream. It helps make it not so hot. I also just used cheddar cheese. This will be a recipe that I use over and over. Happy cooking!!!!  Thanks Lyslw

I made this dish when having friends over for dinner and wow!  I didn't think the recipe looked all that delicious, but it was good!  I added in garlic and more cumin than the recipe calls for, otherwise followed the directions.  Everyone loved it!  The second time I made this, I didn't have any mushrooms or zucchini on hand so I added in extra carrots and black beans, it was still super yummy and I like that it's  relatively healthy dish.

Oh my gosh! This dish is sooo good!  It was a lot to prepare, but well worth the time and effort. I had planned to put some up in the freezer for later, but my husband and I ate all of it by ourselves at 2 meals. I plan to make this often.

My husband and I thought it was delicious. Because there was only 2 of us I cut the recipe in half but still put in the whole can of black beans and the whole 4 oz of green chiles. The green chiles made the dish! Far more flavorful than I thought it was going to be.

I really didn't think this recipe would work, but it was suprisingly good! I have made it a few times now - I leave the shredded carrot out and only bake it for 10-15 minutes to make a faster meal. Always a hit!

This is great except I made a mistake I added the wrong chillis and made it wayyyyy to hot.  So I am going to get some sour cream to maybe cut the heat on the left overs.  It made me sad that I did this because it was really good.  I surved it was corn chips.

Great recipe.  Very tasty.  The only change I made was using mozzarella cheese instead of the Swiss cheese, 'cos that's all I had.  My husband and two year old daughter both loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was a great guideline for the dish I made ; )  Like many others I increase the amount of rice & veggies & used Mexican mixed cheese. I also ended up using green chili sauce instead of the canned green chilies.  The only drawback was the amount of prep time needed.  I do think I'll make this again, just not when I am pressed for time.

A great recipe, although I changed it a bit. Omitted the cumin and green chilies and subbed mexican cheese blend for the swiss. Added 1 16oz can of stewed tomatoes, a lot of garlic powder and a dash of italian seasoning. My picky eaters really liked it.

I read the previous reviews added more rice as suggested and used Monterrey Jack cheese, added lots of carrots, zucchini, broccoli and mushrooms. My husband said it was "really, really, really, really, good". I think it's yummy too.

We loved it.  I made a few ingredient changes because I did not have  everything.  I used chicken thigh instead of breast and cheddar cheese instead of Swiss cheese.  I did not use onions or garlic because I cannot eat them.  Did not matter!  It was delicious right out of the oven and as a warmed up leftover.  Great recipe.

good staple meal, saves well if you want to make it ahead for the week. to save time: rotisserie chicken and minute rice.  this does bring up the price per serving a little bit, but also turns this into a meal you can easily prepare after work or school. 

as others have suggested, replace swiss cheese with a mexican cheese blend or queso quesadilla, use more shredded carrot, and use a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. 

to make it fancy: slice up a few flour tortillas into small bite-size pieces, coat by tossing with a bit of olive oil and salt, pepper, and a bit of cayenne, and toast in the oven for a few minutes alongside the dish til crispy - use as a crunchy topping.

Very easy and quite tasty. I made some exchanges to use ingredients I had on hand: peas instead of mushrooms, white instead of brown rice, Monterey Jack instead of Swiss. I also doubled the carrots. This is a keeper, and easily modified to suit what you have on hand.

Used chicken broth instead of water. Used twice as much cumin , 1 1/2 zucchini and just under 2 cups of shredded carrots. Rice takes a long time to cook-1 hr rather than 45 min and even then, I was concerned it might be too al dente, but I think the 40 baking time afterwards finished the job so the rice was good. Husband loves it and suggested putting leftovers in a wrap with Frank’s hot sauce (he prefers the kick of  that), add some lettuce and there’s a healthy lunch.

We liked it. But I think I would use this as a recipe to clean out the fridge. ex - to use up leftover rice, cooked chicken etc. It would be super fast that way. Otherwise, for me it took more time and dishes than I like. But maybe I am a bit lazy....

Wonderful easy recipe!!! Added minced garlic a little dried cilantro and a can of corn. It turned out great. Will definitely add to my meal rotation.

Great recipe.  Substituted veggie crumbles for chicken breast and 3/4 cup of sweet corn for mushrooms.  Added 3 tsp chopped garlic.  My vegetarian husband loved it.  Couldn't help thinking that this would also be a wonderful burrito filling.

This is one of our favorites. I have made a bunch of changes though to add flavor and make it more kid friendly.
My Changes:
-I use 500g of chicken breast
-I use light mozza cheddar or double cheddar cheese (instead of swiss) and mix 1 cup into casserole and put 1 cup on top.
-I mix up OXO chicken broth (instead of vegetable broth) (2 tsps broth: 2 cups water) and then cook my brown uncle ben's rice as per package instructions to get 2 cups of cooked rice (but I substitute the amount of water for chicken broth to add flavor).
-I do 1 cup carrots shredded/grated
-Added 1 cup rinsed frozen corn 
-I omit the green chili peppers to make it more kid friendly but it does taste great with them too.
-I add more black pepper and cumin then the recipe calls for and I also add minced garlic (fresh or dried is great).

Loved it! Used Trader Joes soy sausages rather than chicken & shredded cojack rather than Swiss. Plus 1 cup brown rice as others suggested. Could have used 2 cups rice - so many veggies. Awesome!

I love this recipe because it is so versatile. Use whatever you have and throw it together and have something a little different each time you make it.

Followed the recipe exactly only replaced zucchini with cucumbers and chopped carrots instead of shredded. Came out pretty uneven with texture as some ingredients were great on their own while others took away from the whole. This was pretty bad as an end result. It looks nice though.

Great for weeknight cooking... I left out the Squash just because I'm not that fond of it but you can pretty much put what ever vegetables you want in it or leave the chicken out all together if you want to go meatless... very versatile recipe... the whole family loved it. Very good.

This was easy and pretty tasty! I made my own black beans so used about 2 cups of that. I cooked 1 cup of dry jasmine rice (out of brown rice) so whatever they amounted up to I threw that in there. Due to being in a hurry and tired I totally bombed the instructions lol but it turned out. Used about a cup of shredded carrots and follows instructions for other veggies. Couldn't even taste the mushrooms, which is great for the kids sake. I could've thrown another chx breast in there but it was good as is. Poured a splash of veg broth over dish before sprinkling cheese on top. Used a 13x9 pan and it was as perfect. Think ill make less next time though. Used cheddar and Monterey cheeses. Turned out excellent! Maybe will try an extra zucchini next time. I would make this again. Will update when kids tell me what they think. Gotta try it again as a vegan meal with brown rice and no chx.

This is a great recipe. I omitted the chicken and a can of corn (along with the zucchini, mushrooms, onion), a little garlic and a pack of taco seasoning that was recommended in a review. It was so delicious! My 3 and 5 year old boys loved it and so did my vegetarian husband. A great way to sneak in those veggies! A must add to my recipe box

I found this recipes and made it because I had all of the main ingredients.  It turned out great.  I made a few changes to use what I had on hand and my substitutions were tasty.  I had Pepper Jack cheese and used that and a can of mild Rotel with green chilies. I forgot the carrots, but honestly didn't miss them.   I can imagine using the Swiss cheese and carrots and getting quite a different taste, but the Tex-Mex taste was very good as well.

this was very good after some modifications.. i didn't have any brown rice so i used some leftover white rice that had the drippings from Ramjam Chicken (on this site) so that gave it a great base flavor.. i used a yellow squash for the zucchini and diced it up instead of slicing thin.. and sliced the onion (half of a small) instead of dicing.. used 1/2 lb of italian seasoned ground turkey for the chicken.. left out the mushrooms.. probably doubled the cumin and used half of a green bell pepper for the canned chiles.. shredded three carrots and used 1 cup of cheddar.. after cooking the veggies i stirred everything into the pot and served inside corn tortillas with a bit of salsa on top.. bf loved these.. ty for the recipe

I've made this a million times - always a hit. Last night, I substituted a drained can of Rotel tomatoes for the green chiles, and it was the best version yet. (I also always double the rice, broth, carrots, and zucchini.)

If you Would like just a little spicy this is perfect.  Next time I would add more heat.  I didn't drain the beans. I think it gave it more flavor and Moist. I did do 1 cup of rice.  I'm on simply smart program for weight watchers perfect

My husband loved it. He is a gourmet chef and I am always afraid to cook for him, since he can out-cook me,and he raved over this casserole. Said it was better than his mother's and had to give samples away. I was so proud. I used homemade black beans and added 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes w/o juice and used cheddar cheese. VERY DELICIOUS!!!

Used chicken broth, added petite diced tomatoes and garlic, omitted mushrooms, zucchini and carrots (didn't have any on hand) and added frozen corn and topped it off with salsa. My kids (ages 10, 9 and 3) loved it. This is in our regular dinner rotation. Thanks for the tasty recipe!!

This is a great recipe- so easy to adjust to what you have on hand. I had raw chicken, so I cooked it with the spices above with some diced carrots. I used cooked rice in a bag (just one bag). I didn't have onions, zucchini, or mushrooms, so I threw in a half cup of frozen corn. I also used cheddar cheese.   Everyone had seconds.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and loved it. I thought it was very tasty. I don't understand how anyone could think this was less than average. I took the suggestion of a reviewer and put it in tortillas, used four cheese Mexican blend instead of swiss and, since I am vegetarian, used quorn tenders to substitute for the chicken. I think this recipe lends itself nicely to any changes you want to make.  I might add sliced black olives next time or some jalepeno.  Thanks for the great and pretty easy recipe!

For my first time making this, I did it as written. I was very happy with how it turned out and got many compliments from the party I took it to. I'd love to add more rice to this in the future and maybe some more spices too. For health reasons I think I'll add less cheese next time too. A great recipe.

Wish I could give it more stars.  I really enjoyed it.  I made it almost as written except I used mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss because non of us like Swiss.  I thought it had good flavor partly because all of my ingredients was fresh from the Amish community.  The reason I can't give it a better ranking as the kids did not enjoy it.  One didn't like it at all and didn't eat it.  They said it was too plain and dry.  It was a little dry.

I omitted the chicken, doubled the rice, used cheddar cheese and added Southwest seasoning and also augmented the spicy factor with two sliced serrano peppers.  YUM!!!

Following the advice in some of the other reviews, I increased the rice, decreased the chicken, and added a can of drained diced tomatoes. I also used Mexican cheese blend and low-fat Colby Jack, because that's what I had on hand. I added chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder, as well. We thought it was pretty darn good.

Not a bad casserole but not worth nearly 2 hours of prep and cooking.  if you had chicken and brown rice left over from a previous meal, this is a good "clean up" recipe but I don't think I will go out and buys all the ingredients for this recipe specifically again.  Made according to directions except I used colby - jack cheese because it seemed to make more sense with the other ingredients.

Based on reading the other reviews, it seems I erred in actually following the recipe exactly, as we found this dish to be underwhelming.

Wow!  Delicious keeper!  I omited the chicken to make it a side dish with tequila lime bbq shrimp & substituted mozzarella cheese to use up what I had on hand.  Family friend raved and he even asked for the recipe so he could make it for his kids.  Try some cilantro sprinkled on top to add some color and deepen the flavor.  Thanks LYSLW!  I'll be making this for years to come!

Yum!! Added extra carrot, mushroom and zucchini and lowered the amount of meat or meat can be left out. I also increased rice to one cup- used instant brown rice. This stuff is awesome.

Tasty and easy and healthy! I did substitute shredded Red. Fat Mexican cheese to cut fat, and 2-3X the amount of rice as others suggested. Makes great leftovers for lunch!

Made it without the chicken.  Very good.  Took advice from comments and doubled the rice, broth and carrots.  Would be great in a wrap.

This is one of our go-to dishes. It is easy to make and is super delicious! We love how it has veggies in it and has that southwest flavor. We usually end up doubling the recipe and keeping one batch in the freezer for future use. Yummo!

I have made this several times and it is a winner!! Great all around meal that includes all of the food groups! I call it chicken casserole, I think the title might skew some people but it's yummy and makes great leftovers! I made as the recipe stated but since then I did not include the carrots or mushrooms because I never have those on hand.  I have made it with other veggies and diff types of cheese and it's still great. Def a casserole that you can dump all your leftovers in. My only complaint is the prep time is a bit long but dont skip!

i just tried this recipe tonight (sans meat) and it's wonderful.  the brilliant part is cooking the rice in the veg broth.  gives it a much richer flavor than it would be with rice cooked in plain water.  and, like others that have reviewed here, i substituted swiss cheese for cheddar and monterey jack (a cup of each).  yum!

Ez, tasty, and nutritious! I went ez on the spices by just using a pinch or so it was enough to give it a tad bit of kick without overwhelming. I'll definately make again but might use 1/2 chicken breast, 1/2 chicken thighs.

I had some brown rice, a can of black beans, and left over chicken to use up.  I also love swiss cheese and fresh mushroons, so I thought this would be a very good recipe to try.  I was wrong, although it was edible, didn't care for the combination at all, and no one else in my family would even try it.

I love this recipe.  Its a great way to use up zucchini from the garden and makes a healthy meal.  I don't change anything except substituting cheddar for the swiss cheese.  Fun to make because it gives me a reason to get out the mandolin!  I think its the fear of losing my fingertips that makes this tool so much fun.  I have made it with canned tomatoes and fresh cilantro for a really nice twist.  I've also added red pepper with the onions a few times just for color.

Excellent Casserole - Easy to make and is very tasty in my opinion.  I stuck to the ingredients called for and I will try the modifications suggested by other reviewers the next time I make it just to see if it comes out any different.  I recommend this recipe, it is a very good way to get brown rice and black beans into your meals.

I used chicken broth instead of veg. broth because that is what I had on hand.  Family really liked it.  It was a little dry for me.  Hubby wants it in the cooking rotation.  Easy to make.

My whole family LOVES this (17months, 6yrs, 8yrs & mom and dad). My take on it: I used fresh spinach, doubled the rice and carrots, used a can of corn instead of zucchini and mushrooms, and used pimentos instead of green chile peppers, lastly I used cheddar instead of swiss. This was scrumptious this way, wowzers.

Excellent! I never seen kids eat so much. I will have to make double for next time. I did make a seperate dish for myself with hot peppers in it and for the main dish used green and red regular peppers. Absolutly loved the rice in the veggie broth. So much flavour. Will leave out the zucchini as I have a child who hates them as well as the mushrooms.
Thanks so much for this!

This was excellent! Definitely agree that it needs more rice, veggies and rinse the beans first. Does anyone know how to convert this recipe for the crock pot?

The whole family loved this recipe! Nice healthy meal. We wrapped it up in whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit hardier. I will definitely add more of the brown rice the next time I make it however.

This was pretty good, but nothing special. I made it exactly as written except I added chopped tomato & replaced the can of green chili peppers with regular fresh green pepper. 
I used the leftovers as burrito filling & sprinkled with more cheese served with salsa & sour cream....this was a little better than the 1st time around! But still not anything special

Brown Rice BB Casserole Haiku: "Could use some color. Tasted good, looked kind of blah. Tomatoes or corn?" We really enjoyed this easy dish, and the only thing that I did differently was to dice and saute the carrots w/ the onion, add a generous TB of "Taco Seasoning I" (win!), and swap Swiss for Mexi-cheese blend. But the appearance was somewhat dull, so I think it could benefit from the addition of diced tomatoes or corn, for some added color and veggies. I'm not sure that cumin, cayenne and salt would be enough to flavor this, so I suggest either adding extra spices, or be bold and try the amazing "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from here too for added oomph. I ate mine w/ cilantro on top, and my husband wrapped his in a warm corn tortilla w/ sour cream and salsa. Great way to blend lots of great veggies w/ healthy brown rice and beans, and it's a recipe that I would make again.

So good! I omitted the carrots and instead added more mushrooms just because I love them and dislike carrots. Don't leave out the chillies they really add a lot of flavor!! Thanks so much!! :)

This has great flavor!  I am not a huge casserole maker but we really enjoyed this!  As others I didn't use swiss I used a combo of monterey jack and pepper jack cheese.  I used cremini mushrooms in this as well and YUM!!!

This can be adaptable according to the ingredients you have on hand. I did add more spices, like a couple dashes of garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, more cumin. and I think it needs some kind of liquidy base mixed in to prevent it from being dry, for instance sour cream and milk or a tomatoey base (marinara sauce or tomato sauce?)  I doubled the rice and broth though, that is a must. I also used monterrey jack instead of swiss.

Delicious! Based on past reviews, I made a few changes. Use white rice rather than brown (what I had on hand), used 1/2 cup of rice rather than 1/3 cup, added 1/2 a diced green bell pepper, bulked up the shredded carrots a bit, and used reduced fat marble jack cheese rather than swiss. Sooo good! I could have eaten way more than one portion in a sitting!

I made a vegetarian version of this simply by leaving out the chicken.  I didn't have mushrooms or carrots so I didn't add them but I used everything else in the same measurements as stated in the recipe.  Its a fantastic dish and it makes a lot; i thought swiss cheese was a nice addition but I do want to try it once with a monetery jack blend.  thanks for the recipe!

This is a terrific springboard for a variety of bean/rice/chicken casseroles. My latest version: leftover black bean potage, leftover cooked rice, leftover cooked chicken, shredded carrots, Monterey Jack cheese, and the cumin/cayenne listed. Yum yum yum

Great healthy & delicious meal!  Used Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (pre-cooked, just microwave for 90 seconds) to save time.  Threw in all the veggies plus peppers and canned tomatoes (draining first as suggested by others).  Both my husband and I loved it... looking forward to leftovers for lunch.

Yummolischious! I didn't use the carrots and subbed canned chicken for fresh and used a fresh jalapeño instead of cayenne... I chopped up all the veggies small enough that my kids couldn't tell what they were... Everyone loved it and it was super easy to make too!

We liked this. It turns out a little bit like a chicken enchilada (not surprisingly) I used less chicken and more rice and zucchini than called for. I also substituted cheddar for the swiss and used fresh chile instead of the canned. While I did get carrots, DP was snacking on them while I was cooking so I nearly forgot. I shredded a few on top which added some color but not much flavor, and I don't think the recipe needed it especially with the zucchini so I would probably just omit it the next time unless I had carrots on hand I needed to use.

SO YUMMY!! I was a little skeptical when making this, as the reviews had been SO good but it seemed SO weird ingredient wise - it's awesome! A total keeper in our house. I did change the swiss to jack and added a small red pepper. My husband added some sour cream to the top of his as well as some salsa chips and said it was great that way.

This is sooo good-love it!! I didn't measure any of the veggies, just used 1 carrot, a bag of shredded zucchini I had in the freezer(probably 1-1 1/2 cups, 4 mushrooms, chopped & 2 green onions. I also used a little extra cumin (cuz I love it) & no salt! I also used monterey jack & cheddar cheeses-swiss just doesn't seem right w/these ingredients?! My only complaint is that the brown rice soaked up the 1 cup of broth before it cooked completely so I ended up just leaving out the rice altogether. This would be great in a wrap or a Mexican-type eggroll!! Thank you!!

I can't give this a fair rating.  It would probably be good (my husband enjoyed it), but I tried a shortcut.  I thought I could not saute the onions and zucchini to save some time.  I thought they'd cook in the oven, but they didn't cook enough.  The onions especially were too raw/strong.  I will be trying this again...following the directions next time!  I just thought I'd share my experience so you won't make the same "dumb" mistake.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe but it turned out to be very good.  I left out the chilis and carrots and used a Mexican cheese blend instead of Swiss.  I also doubled the rice.  It's good as is or, for another option, it's also great in a tortilla.

It seemed lite on the rice compared to the other recipes. I made it as stated with the omission of the carrots simply as I wasn't feeling like shredding any. It was good but not that interesting to me. My husband loved it, the kids not so much. Would perhaps attempt again with more flavorings and adding more rice, might change up the veggies also.

This was very good - I used frozen pre-cooked brown rice instead of cooking it separately, and just tossed it in with the other sauteed ingredients with a little stock, and some chopped fresh jalapenos instead of the canned chilis, and I tossed in a chopped tomato.  I probably used about 2 tsp. cumin. I only had one chicken breast, but between that and the beans, this was still a very filling meal. Thanks for sharing!

This was a really good recipie. I followed some of the advice of the reviews and it turned out great. I want to just keep eating... I agree could have easily cut back on half the cheese to cut the caloris and have a nice balanced meal. Will make again and again. But I would agree not enough rice in origional recipie. leftovers were great too.

I enjoyed this one, but it seemed like it was missing something.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added shredded carrots, and canned corn as well as doubling the rice.  Also I only used cheddar cheese.  Couldn't quite figure out what was missing though.  Maybe garlic? I did realize after the fact that I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  Maybe that did it. I'd make it again though.  Everybody liked it :)

I left out the oil and mushrooms, and I used cheddar cheese and dried minced onion instead of fresh.  It was so yummy!  I love how healthy and delicious this meal is!  Definitely a keeper in our house!

A great all-in-one meal.  I doubled it and made 1/2 without cheese for the gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free people at the table... I'm looking for easy, complete allergen-free main dishes and this one works!!  Definitely a bit of prep but a food processor helps with the carrots.

I didn't want to rate the meal since I made so many changes, but... It was wonderful!!  I didn't measure anything and know I used more rice and carrots than called for and had to leave out the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  Also used a tiny bit of mexican chilli powder since I didn't have a can (and I don't like hot spicy food), and regular black pepper instead of cayane.  Used leftover thigh meat instead of breasts.  My 18 month old mainly just picked out the beans to eat (loved them!).  That was a big improvement over last night when she wouldn't eat any of our dish at all (including the parts she usually loves).   We will definitely be trying this again, hopefully with some mushrooms.  Thanks for an awesome starting point with this dish!!!

It was ok, will try again. I didn't have cumin or enough brown rice so I used white rice. I think the lack of those two ingredients might have changed the result. I think next time I will make true to the recipe except leaving out the chicken and I will use this as a side dish.

Good recipe but tweaked it: Sauteed garlic with the onion until soft, added the zucchini, mushrooms and cumin, cooked for 5 min(omitted the chicken to make it vegetarian for lent); added 2 cups of vegetable broth, brought to boil, added 1 cup of brown rice. When broth was absorbed, added the carrots, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 cup cheddar jack cheese and 1 cup frozen corn. Before baking I spread the remaining 1 cup of cheese on top. Put in covered baking pan for 20 min and uncovered for 10. Omitted the cayenne pepper and chile peppers for a less spicy dish. YUM!!

This recipes was great and has so many foods that are good for you in it!  I did do a little substituting only because I didn't want to go to the store, but I will definitely be making this again.

Just loved this dish.  It was a lot of work, but I enjoy cooking and didn't mind the prep.  The best part of it all...my boyfriend went back for thirds and since I made it 3 weeks ago, he has asked me to make it 4 times since!  I made it just as the recipe states, and I wouldn't change a thing!

My only changes - substituted a bit of canned corn for the mushrooms, did not add carrots, and used water instead of broth.  Also used leftover instant brown rice, and cheddar instead of swiss.  I really liked this.... it just needed some TANG!  So I served with sour cream and it was still missing something.  Frank's Red Hot made it so much better.  I would make this again.

Great recipe! I also doubled the rice, made it vegetarian by omitting chicken and adding lots more mushrooms and zuccini. I think you could reduce the cheese (and use cheddar!) to reduce calories and still have a great meal. We topped with sour cream and served with wheat tortillas! Great meal!

This turned out better than I thought. I used up some leftover brown rice I had in the frig and I also added a can of corn. I shredded the carrots on the fine part of my grater so they were small and cooked up tender and I cut the zucchini into small strips (hubby isnt a big veggi eater). Other than that I followed the recipe. Very good!

We have this recipe quite often, as it is one of our favorites!  We use what ever cheese we have on hand and usually substitute corn for the zucchini since my husband isn't a fan of that vegetable.

I thought it was really good, but the only thing I would recommend would be to skip the carrots.  They are nice for color (otherwise this is a bit bland in color), but I even sauteed them to try to make the contrast in consistency go away (as compared to the other ingredients) and they stuck out like a sore thumb.  Maybe my carrots were too thick--I don't know.  Other than that, fantastic, and very healthy.  I used the "mexican" blend of cheese with 2% milk as well.

I liked this recipe a lot.. I did do a few things differently:  I used orzo instead of rice (I didn't mark my canisters correctly & had lots of orzo to use up...oops) I added red bell pepper, I didn't use the zuchini.  It came out great this way & I'm sure it'll be great when I do follow the recipe exactly next time.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I have to be honest that I was leary about it, even while I was prepping, but wow!  So yummy! I stuck to te recipe pretty closely except I changed the serving size to 4 (since it's just my husband and I), I doubled the rice amount, and the veg. broth too of course.  I added more shredded carrot based on another reviewer's recommendation.  And also took the advice of several by using Mexican Cheese blend instead of swiss.  I greased a very deep dish 9 in pie pan and baked how the recipe said.  It was awesome, definitely going in my recipe box.  Best part is, I finally found a way to get my husband to eat more vegatables!!  Thank's so much for sharing this recipe!!

My husband I both thought this was really good.  I followed advice from other reviews and doubled the rice (and broth) plus added 1 tsp. salt to the liquid when cooking the rice.  It took longer to cook rice than indicated.  I also added bell pepper, 1 cup mushrooms, 2 zucchini and more cumin.  For the cheese I used pepper jack because we like things on the spicy side.  Can't wait to have it as leftovers.

It's not visually appetizing, but this was really yummy! I made a few changes to suit my taste: I left out the cayenne and carrots but added a little fresh garlic to saute with the onion. Then I used cheddar and colby instead of swiss. My husband and 7 yr old liked it too. And even my picky 5 year old ate it. But I did have him taste it before he saw it.

This recipe is easily affordable and adaptable and tasted great.  I used shredded pork and mexican cheese blend (what I had on hand).  The leftovers were a great filling for wraps too.  Thanks!

This is classic and delicious comfort food. Due to what I had on hand, I made the following changes.

1 cup brown rice instead of 1/3 cup
1 cup water with chicken and garlic bouillon instead of broth
At least 1 cup of onion
Added 1 can petite diced tomatoes, completely drained
Substituted Mexican cheese for Swiss and used less
Added 1/4 tsp. garlic power and Greek seasoning

Omitted cumin, zucchini, chicken, peppers and carrots

This was absolutely delicious!  I used Colby Jack instead of Swiss and increased all my vegetables except the beans.  I also used a little yellow summer squash with the zucchini.  I didn't have add the chicken since I didn't have any and it was still yummy.  This would make an excellent veggie burrito filling!

We liked this!  I made only a couple of modifications.  I couldn't find canned green chiles, so I bought some picked ones and rinsed them well before using them.  I also used Mexican cheese as did some of the other reviewers.  I'd like to try it with Swiss cheese, though - I expect it would give a very interesting flavor.

I was surprised. This was pretty good, but it wasn't that "casserole-ish". I used cheddar instead, but I didn't have that much, but it was still good and creamy. And I used chicken broth instead cuz that's what I had, and I used squash instead of carrots. We liked it and will probably make it again. Oh and I liked the amount of rice in it and wouldn't change it, but I could see why some people would want more.

I was very suprised by how good this was. It was a little more work then I had anticipated but worth it. Next time I am going to use more veggies and less chicken to make it a more balanced meal.

Great recipe!  I used 1 of the little Success precooked brown rice containers to speed up the process and swapped the swiss for reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend to cut back on fat and calories.

I had my doubts, but this was great!  I excluded the onions and carrots, and used shredded jalapeno jack cheese instead of swiss.  I also added some onion powder and minced garlic.  This was very flavorful and I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious!  I was skeptical at first about the relatively small amount of rice, but it was perfect.  I also cut the cheese by about half an it was still very satisfying.  Added some chopped fresh cilantro too, nice touch.  Thanks for a good hearty recipe!

The flavor was very tasty, sortof Mexican, but I felt it was missing something.  Maybe some salsa or sour cream on top would be good.  I also thought the carrots were out of place.  The mushrooms and zuccini seemed odd, but weren't too bad.  Overall, I'd make it again, but add my own toppings.

My family LOVED this dish!  The only thing I didn't have was the swiss cheese...I had mozzerella and cheddar, so I used it.  This will be a keeper for sure!  Great served with salsa and sour cream.  Even my 15month old ate it up!  Thanks!!

I, too, am not a huge fan of zucchini or black beans.  However, this casserole was really tasty!  Really nice flavor with lots of veggies.  I used minute brown rice to save time and hubby enjoyed his portion with some salsa and sour cream on the side.  Thanks for this recipe, it's a new favorite!!

I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but it sounded interesting and healthy.  The entire family loved it!  It did take a lot longer to make than noted, but still worth it.
