I threw in a can of Budweiser left over from last summer, some thyme and rosemary,  green pepper, and some brine from an olive jar. (Most things I make end up Stone Soup.)  I browned the chicken in turkey grease from thanksgiving, which I keep in the freezer; it gives chicken dishes a nice flavor.

I goofed a bit with the order of adding the potatoes.  I had made my own veggie stock and used that which is always a good thing. I added a beefsteak tomato that was sitting in the fridge along with a about 3/4 cup of frozen peas, then a 10 oz can of petite cut roma tomatoes with its juice. Last, i added  a whole can of premade biscuit dough. i cut  each one in fours and topped the soup in the last 10 mins so we had cheaters dumplings.  SOOO good!!

This is a very simple, and very good recipe, that I believe is easily tailored to how you like your chicken soup. Making the recipe as-is, it still tastes great. However, I like my chicken soups a bit more 'herby' so I added in some dried thyme and rosemary. Other than that, I made as written. The potatoes are a great addition--they really add a nice flavor and texture to the soup. I would definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!
