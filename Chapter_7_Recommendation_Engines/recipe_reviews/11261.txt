Guess what? If you think it is strange to put Tang in a cookie - trust your instincts. These just taste weird and chalky. Skip the Tang and use fresh OJ and orange zest for orange cookies.

Not sure if I did something wrong when I made these, but the batter was quite runny. Looked more like cake batter than cookie dough. I ended up making one pan of bars and one dozen cookies. Despite the weird consistency, these tasted delicious. I would probably make them again.

The orange flavor is too strong.  If I make them again, I will cut the amount of Tang in half or at least by 1/3.

Also, this didn't have any impact on the taste or texture of the cookie after it was baked, but the dough was unusually dry as opposed to the usual stickiness of cookie dough.

If you like Dreamsickles, you will like these cookies!

I tried these cookies right after making them and I didn't think they were that great.  I tried them the next day, and for some reason, they tasted better.  The cookies were okay but I probably won't make them again--I'm not a huge fan of orange and white chocolate.

Tang cookies were one of my boyfriends favorite childhood treat so I've been looking for a recipe for some time.  I've tried a few others but this was by far the best!  They are super soft and moist.  I'm not a fan of tang and even I liked these.  I didn't make the glaze but thought they were great without. I make half with the white chocolate chips b/c thats how my bf remembers and loves them.  But I make the other half with regular choc chips b/c thats how I like them because they aren't quite as sweet and taste like those chocolate oranges!

Absoultely yummy! These cookies came out very soft and moist. They do taste a lot like an Orange Creamcycle icecream bar! It is something different from your basic flavors of cookies (peanut butter, chocolate chip, sugar). I totally recommend these!

I made this for my nieces, but my mom and sister liked them better.  I thought they were a little sweet, but I was told, "That's what makes them so good!"

I HATE Tang, but these were actually pretty good.  My husband thought they were the best of the 6 different kinds of cookies I made for his work party.  I thought they tasted like baby asprin, but what do I know?  :-)

These cookies got lots of compliments. I found the glaze to be too sweet, so I left it off.

VERY sweet frosting. Go light on top. Quite the surprising hit! I was a bit apprehensive with this recipe and even after they came out of the oven, but couldn't stop eating them myself! Kids'll love these!

Everyone liked this cookie, to me it was a little to sweet.  I am not a big fan of tang that could be why.  Next time I would subsitute tang for Kool Aid.  Celia

My daughter loved these and she is very hard to please!  She said these are the cookies she wants me to send to school on her birthday.

These are incredibly soft, incredibly sweet, and incredibly good.  A professional baker who tasted my batch hailed them as the best cookies she's ever had, and she's adapted the recipe to fit her repetoire.

A little to sweet for me.  The white chips make it a little to sweet.  Next time I will use less.
