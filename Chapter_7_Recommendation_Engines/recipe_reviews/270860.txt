Rather than frying it I baked it at high heat on a pizza stone.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.  browned nicely.  Flavor was perfect.  Used it for appetizer base.

Delicious!  Be sure to roll thin enough. My first couple were a bit thick.  They bubbled and charred beautifully!  So good!

The second piece I cooked turned out good. High seems like it was too hot on an electric coil stove. I ended up with charred spots that are similar to the ones pictured when I turned the burner down to medium.

I think that 1/2 recipe of the garlic butter is the right amount for the bread in this recipe.

Delicious and chewy! Although high heat is too hot for making this on a cast iron. My first few ended up burnt due to the instructions to heat my pan as hot as possible. Medium high is perfect for some slight charring. Also I used just regular flour and rolled some chopped garlic in with the cilantro to add even more texture and it turned out very yummy! Thank you chef John!

This was so much better than store bought.  It takes a little patience to fry them up in the skillet, but so worth the wait!  Followed directions exactly!  I was impressed at how good this turned out on my first try at making Naan bread.  Will add this to my regular bread making recipes!  (served with his creamy cashew chicken curry)

Apparently high heat on a glass electric cook top is way too hot.  The first one was scorched in seconds and the others just cooked too fast.  Everything else was awesome.  The flavor and smell was spot on and indeed the more I made, the better they got.  This was mainly because my skillet needed to cook a bit.

This is a very easy-to-follow recipe. I substituted sour cream for greek yogurt, and it worked great.  It's delicious fresh, or later, and I have used it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Thank you for an amazing recipe.

I am slowly conquering my fear of yeast breads - this was a bit time-consuming, but it came out so delicious, and in the end it was so so so easy!

I used a cast iron skillet, it worked very well for the bread.  My first time trying making naan. This was easy to follow and very happy with the results.  I will be enjoying it with my experimental Indian vegetable stew. I ususally make chicken tikka masala, but thought I would try something different.  Thank you for sharing.

OMG!!  I never thought I would be able to make this at home.  I used my cast iron skillet and heated it up super hot.  Follow the directions and you will be eating and enjoying this beautiful Naan in no time.

Very easy recipe to follow and the video made it much better to watch Chef Johns recipe.  Loved the term “shaggy dough”

Wonderful bread! will have to say I had to sub sour cream for yogurt, wife ate the last of the yogurt, doh! Did roll a bit thinner than 1/8" but cooked up to about  1/4". Reminded me of a pancake, soft, but had a wonderful chewy side to it. Can not have enough butter and garlic in one's life!
