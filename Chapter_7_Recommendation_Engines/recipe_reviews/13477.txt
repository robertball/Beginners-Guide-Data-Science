This cheesecake tasted just like the pumpkin cheesecake we used to serve at a 5 star restaurant in washington d.c. years ago.  Their head pastry chef made it every fall to run through the holidays.  I did have to make a few changes to make this recipe more of a creamy cheesecake that most people are used to.  I used 3 8oz packages of cream cheese instead of 2, added 1/2 cup of sour cream (Fold the sour cream in after adding the eggs), and increased the pumpkin puree to 1 8oz can. I also had to adjust the spices a bit for my taste (added 1 tbls of spiced rum to the pumpkin mixture and a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon).  I baked this in a water bath at 350 for 1 hr (till the middle jiggles like jello), then turn off the oven, prop the door open and let the cheesecake sit for another hour, I promise you it will not crack at all. I used a 10in springform pan and a shortbread cookie crust.  I used one of the caramel sauce recipes from this web site and poured it over the cheesecake to give it a caramel glaze like the one at the restaurant had.  It was fabulous!!!  I took it to work, went to answer the phone, came back 10 minutes later and the whole cheesecake was gone!!!  I couldn't believe it!!  Now I have to make another one so my boyfriend can get a piece.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!!!!!!

Revamping this review ----
I've been making this recipe since Thanksgiving of 2002. Since then, its made its way to work potlucks, holiday dinners, and various gatherings I've attended.  I always like to find shortcuts in the kitchen and these are the few alterations I've made to this recipe, which in my opinion is a good base.  :)  First, instead of using the pumpkin puree and all the spices...I simply used a can of pumpkin pie filling...Libby's or the cheap store brand (which i used). I use  3/4 cup.  It boosts the pumpkin flavor overall.  Make sure your cream cheese is room temperature. It blends better. 3/4 cup of sugar.  1 tsp vanilla. 1/2 tsp cinnamon. You can stop there if you're using the filling.  OR..you can continue (even if you're using filling) and add 1 pinch of clove, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. I carefully layered 1 1/2 cup of the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of the crust.  Then added the pumpkin mixture on top carefully.  Make sure your crust is not cracked or out dated when you get it from the store.  Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 50-55 mins or until center of pie is set (center will spring back when touched).  Thanks to Stephanie for a wonderful recipe.

Instead of buying pumpkin puree, I bought pumpkin pie filling that has all if the spices already in it (the puree doesn't). So, if you don't have all of those spices seperate listed in the recipe, you don't have to buy them just to make this pie. The can of pumpkin pie filling is quite big and you won't use the whole thing (I used 3/4 Cup), but it can be frozen for three months or kept in the fridge for upto a week.  I didn't have a  graham cracker crust on hand, I used a 9in DEEP pie shell and it turned out good and completely filled that shell up. I cooked mine for about 55-60 minutes before it was done. One last thing, on the plain cream cheese layer you put on the bottom, I used a little over a cup of that to make it more pronounced so you could see it better when it was cut..I think you could even go 1 1/2 cups and it would be fine if you want more of a cream cheese flavor. I took this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My mom said all she wanted for Christmas was another pie all for herself!

LOVED it!  I made the following adjustments in order to fit in a springform pan:  3 (8 oz.) cream cheese (MUST be at room temp!), 3/4 cup white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream (add after the eggs), 1 heaping cup pumpkin puree, 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I made my own graham cracker crust and pressed into a 10-inch springform pan.  Did NOT bake the crust prior to adding the cheesecake mixture.  Poured 2 cups of plain batter into bottom before mixing in the pumpkin.  Baked with pan of water on bottom shelf at 350 for 1 hour and then turned off heat and propped the oven door open for another hour.  Had one small crack in it but I didn't care because it tasted amazing!!  Will make again and again!  Side note: graham cracker crust: 1 1/2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup white sugar,  6 tablespoons butter, (melted),  Mix and press into bottom of springform pan with waxed paper.

I made this recipe three times.  The first just like the recipe is printed and it was very tasty but it wasn't like a cheesecake.  So the next time I doubled the recipe.  I made one batch of filling and added that to the crust and then made another batch and added the pumpkin and spices.  This was really like a cheesecake but I had a few lumps.  The next time I made sure the cream cheese and eggs were at room temp. and made it the same way as the second time and what a differance.  I will be making this over and over.  I also made a different crust and cooked it in a springform pan.
Thank you so much!

I made this recipe as directed the first time and it was wonderful; although, it is more of a cheese pie than a cheesecake.  To make it easier instead of using all the spices individually I used pumpkin pie spice, and I used lots of it.  The second time I made it I made several alterations for a more elegant cheesecake.  I made it in a springform pan with a crust made out of crumbled gingersnaps.  I added more to the cream cheese layer and used more pumpkin for a more pumpkin flavor.  For an elegant top (can also cover up cracks), I bought a folded frozen pie crust and used tiny leaf shaped cookie cutters to cut out leaves which I brushed with butter and cooked separately, and once the cheesecake was cooked I placed the leaves all over the top and then drizzled with carmel.  I left out whipped topping all together.  It was very elegant and still tasted just as good.  However, with the spring form pan and extra cream cheese layer, I had to cook it much longer.

It was GREAT!!!! After reading other reviews I used pumpkin pie filling (instead of puree w/ all the spices). I also added some extra cinnamon, sugar and vanilla. To make it ever better I melted together a bag of caramels and a can of evaportated milk to make a caramel sauce. I drizzeled the caramel sauce over each slice before serving with some whip cream...YUM!

Have to admit I'm flummoxed by all the rave reviews. I love pumpkin and I love cheesecake but this didn't do it for me. It was ok. That's about it. Oh and I love the people saying they bought pumpkin pie filling instead of "having to measure out all the spices" or whatever. What? How lazy are you? There's three spices!

A very tasty dessert!  For cheesecake lovers, you may want to double the amount of cream cheese mix.  Or, atleast add 1/2 more because the pumpkin pie layer is thicker than the cheesecake layer.  It's very rich, but definitely worth it!  Gobble, gobble.

According to my cookbook for this recipe, which has this recipe in it verbatim except for one problem, you are supposed to mix the 1/2 cup puree w/ the 1 cup of plain batter and set THAT aside. The remaining plain batter goes in the bottom, making the thicker layer the white layer. That takes care of people feeling the need to add more cream cheese mixture--it was just supposed to be mixed up differently to begin with. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit over the holidays!  I also made a few changes by combining some suggestions from previous reviews.  first off, I made a gingersnap/shortbread cookie crust in a 10 inch springform pan.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream(as suggested in a previous review).  After putting in the first layer I added almost a whole can of pumpkin puree and added more spices than the recipe called for and 1 tbsp of spiced rum suggested in a previous review. I cooked it in a water bath at 350 for one hour and it didn't crack at all.  I served this with a homemade cinnamon whipped cream.  Everyone loved this cheesecake and I will definitely be making it again!!!  Thanks for the great recipe and for all the great reviews!

I made this cheescake for 'Happy Friday' at work and EVERYONE loved it!!!! I added another 8oz brick of cream cheese, a full 8oz cup of pumpkin and I have a really good recipe for graham cracker crust so I used that. I topped of cheesecake with chopped walnuts mixed in sugar and caramel topping. OMGosh!!! It's 10:20am here and the cheesecake is almost gone. This recipe is outstanding and perfect for the holidays! FYI - the crust recipe is: 1 cup finely crushed graham crachers, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg and 5 tablespoons melted butter, I use salted. You can't go wrong with SOUTHERNBELLE0908's suggestion and this crust!!! Thanks!

it was good except i had to bake it for an extra 20-25 mins because it didnt have the cheesecake texture. Besides that, it was good.  And to avoid having cracks on the cheesecake, I put the pie on a baking sheet filled with a little bit of water.

I made bars instead of a cake/pie. I lined an 8"x13" pan with wax paper, sprayed with Pam, and pressed in the graham cracker crust (2 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar, 2/3 cup butter). I doubled all of the ingredients for the filling and spooned into the crust as directed. I baked at 325 for about an hour (until the center felt set when I lightly poked with my finger), turned off the oven, opened the door, and left it to sit for a few hours before transferring to the fridge. When it was cool, I was able to lift the entire thing out of the pan with the wax paper and easily cut into bars -- which were a HUGE HIT! This is definitely my new go-to recipe for a fall/holiday/winter dessert for potlucks, get-togethers, etc. Yum!!!

Updated: I have made this recipe following the original recipe and the modified version from the highest rated review and here is what I found. When making this cheesecake from the original recipe you get a more firmer cheesecake faster and it tastes sensational. Now when going with the modified "5 star restaurant" review recipe I found that you have to let the cheesecake chill at least overnight in order to not end up eating pudding and you have to cook for much longer than the original recipe states-twice as long in my case. Once the cheesecake has chilled overnight it is less pudding-ish and more like an overly creamy cheesecake. The modified recipe is also not as sweet as the original though I'm not sure that is neccessarily a good thing. I think that in the future I will stick with the original recipe only making extra ( 1 1/2 of the recipe total) to generously fill my pie crust.

I pretty much followed this recipe exactly. Everyone loved it. I did make a minor change, I made mini cheesecakes instead of 1 big one. I took crushed graham crackers and butter and lined the bottom of cupcake liners and then followed the recipe as directed. I added some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor.

Ahhhhh....visions... that with this amazing recipe and my amazing culinary skills, I could open up my very own cafe and be just amazing......This is truly how FANTASTIC this is!! I did make my own base with graham cracker crumbs, butter and brown sugar, set in a large spring form pan. I added another cream cheese brick to the mix to make sure there would be enough to reasonably fill up the pan. With that, I did add another egg, a bit more sugar (about 1/4 cup), and 1/2 tsp more vanilla. Because I wanted it very "pumpkin-y" I increased the amount to 1 cup. I also used pie filling instead of puree. I did add more spices too. So delicious, maybe one day I WILL open a cafe and this will be the first thing on my menu! THANK YOU!

I make this recipe at least 5 times every fall, it is a must have!  After pouring in the first layer of cheesecake mix, it helps to put it in the freezer for a couple minutes until the rest of the batter is done.  That way they don't mix and you get a more defined double layer.  I also use pre-mixed pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices, and I usually sprinkle some cinnamon on top just for show.

Gorgeous. I prefer to use a spring-form pan for my cheesecakes, so I doubled this recipe to accomodate using a 9-inch spring-form pan. I also baked it in a water bath at about 250 F for approximately 90 minutes (or until the edges are firm but the center still has a slight jiggle) then turned off the oven and opened the door to let the temperature slowly drop and prevent the top from cracking. If you're using a water bath, be sure to wrap the outside of the pan in tin foil so you don't get a soggy crust. Once cool, I piped a cinnamon buttercream boarder and garnished with pecans.

Great Recipe! I'm on Weight watchers, so I substituted Splenda for Sugar and Low-Fat Cream cheese for regular cream cheese. I baked it in a low-fat pre-made graham cracker crust. It is absolutely wonderful, and only has 5 points per serving! I will be making this again for Thanksgiving!

My guests and I loved this.  The only change I plan on making is to increase the plain cheesecake filling; it was barely noticeable.

This is really good, a few notes however, DO NOT use a stand mixer for this recipe, it will not reach all parts of the cream cheese and will leave chunks. 
Also I read others used pumpkin pie mix instead of the puree, I did this by accident and the person buying it no longer liked it, the pie mix has condensed sweetened milk in it and adds too much liquid and makes the top more a pumpkin pie over a cheesecake, make sure that is something you want before doing that, if you use the pumpkin puree both layers with be a cheesecake consistency but the top one will taste like pumpkin, everyone I've made it for loves it this way and didn't like it with the pie mix.

This is a wonderful cheesecake recipe! I doubled it and made two. Somehow, I wound up with too much filling so I used my leftovers to make little mini cheesecakes. I had enough to make 6 and my kids went crazy over them. I placed a nilla wafer in the bottom of the cupcake liner, and baked for 15 minutes. Simple to serve and a perfect portion!

Yummy, I followed the advice of others:
1) increased cream cheese to 2 1/2 packages 2) increased sugar by 2tbsp 3) increased content of pumpkin 4) made my own graham cracker crust (1 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of sugar, 6 tbsp of butter, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon)- bake crust for 10 minutes prior to adding cheesecake mixture. Like others,I did 1 1/2 cup of plain cheesecake on the bottom and the rest on the top. I lined the bottom of spingform pan with parchment paper, I would cool in the oven with the door closed for a couple of hours before placing it in the fridge to prevent cracking. I baked for 50-55 min. I placed a pan of water on the shelf below because I did not want to place the actual cake in the water as per other reviews and fear of water seaping into cheesecake. Enjoy :)

I make this cheesecake every Thanksgiving and my husband raves about it to his friends.  I do make a few changes to make it a little healthier but it comes out perfect every time.  I use 1 package light cream cheese, 1 package fat free cream cheese, 1/2 cup splenda, 4 egg whites, and fat free cool whip.  Thanks for the great recipe.

UPDATE: I just made this with a gingersnap crust and it is sooooo delicious. I knew I was going to want to try it so I made a mini cheese cake with one of my small glass Pyrex bowls. It was the perfect size for a snack (this gives me the idea to make half a batch and bake them in those bowls for a treat!) Anyway- I basically made a graham cracker crust only I found gingerbread graham crackers and used those instead. The extra flavor from them made this cheesecake out of this world delicious!!

 This cheesecake was AMAZING!!!! I've been wanting to try making pumpkin cheesecake so I decided to give this recipe a try based on the great reviews it had. I followed the recipe to a t (minus adding a little more pumpkin and following others suggestions of putting more "plain" cheesecake on the bottom- for more even layers. I also used pumpkin pie spice since I had that and not all of the individual spices). Anyway- it was great, fabulous, amazing! I absolutely loved it!! I'm making it for both Thanksgiving's I'll be going to this weekend. I'm also going to double it and put it in a cake pan to bring for our holiday potluck at work! I think this is the best recipe I've found on here! If you like pumpkin pie but LOVE cheesecake you'll be sure to love this recipe!!!!

This was a MILLION times more successful than I anticipated. I saw all the incredible reviews, but not a one did the recipe justice. I made two pies, one for my family and one for my boyfriends family... the first pie was with a homemade graham cracker crust, and the second was store bought... both were given the highest praise... and both my family and my boyfriends family told me they would come after me in my sleep if I even dared take their slice away :-P. This is DEFINITELY going to become a yearly for me. There isn't a recipe out there that can beat this one. Oh, and the best part... I was the one that was given all the praise :-D Thanks for this wonderful prize-winner Stephanie!

I made this for a men's fellowship dinner this past weekend. Very good! 
 I doubled the recipe (added a little more spice and pumpkin to boot) and made a thick Graham cracker crust in a 10" spring-form pan. I also decided to bake it in a water bath. Took 1 hour 15 min to bake but NICE! At the end, I added some allspice, cinn. and nutmeg to the whipped cream and dusted it w more allspice. Oh boy!

DELICIOUSSSSSSSSS! Raves upon raves for this one. I have never been a fan of Pumpkin Pie and yet I wanted to serve a dessert for our Thanksgiving meal that would be *pumpkin-ish* and this is PERFECT! So attractive with its layers, and the flavour is delicious! **Note: Make sure you use just a little whipped topping on top (preferrably the spray kind). I used a little too much of the frozen whipped topping on top, and it seemed to be a bit too runny over the sides when i served the slices. But either way, DEEE-LISH!! The best pumpkin dessert I've ever tried. QUESTION: WHAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TOPPING THAT I COULD USE INSTEAD OF WHIPPED CREAM (TO ADD AN ATTRACTIVE TOP, BUT ALSO TO HIDE ANY CRACKS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE BAKING PROCESS. THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY IDEAS!

I have never baked before in my life.  The closest I have come is making cake from a box.  

I've made this pie 3 times, and all 3 times have been a huge success!

This recipe was fairly easy for a first timer.  The only frustrating thing was that those pre-made graham cracker crusts break easily (I accidentally broke 2 of those darn things).

I altered the recipe slightly:

-1 teaspoon vanilla extract (instead of 1/2)
-3/4 cup Libby's pumpkin puree (instead of 1/2)
-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (instead of 1/2)
-1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg (instead of 1/2 pinch)

It wasn't bland the other way, but this way if much preferred.  I also made my own whipped cream, it was really easy and the texture and taste exceeded store bought whipped cream significantly.

This pie took 50 minutes to cook.  I would suggest checking it after 40 minutes, just to be safe.  But at 35 minutes, it was clearly not even close to being done.

Overall, this pie had a good texture, flavor, presentation, and is an overall crowd-pleaser!

This recipe rocks.  People actually argued over the last piece.  I was forced to make 2 more pies.  I deviated from the recipe a little by making the layers more equal, and by using more pumpkin (and spices) than it called for, so the top was more pumpkiny.  Even people who hate pumpkin pie loved it.

Wow!!!! First time ever making cheesecake and this was beyond good. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but my husband is and he was going on and on at how good it was. I did use three packs of cream cheese otherwise kept recipe exact. I layered the cream cheese filling with 1.5 cups so it was more pronounced. I baked it in a water bath and when it was finished I left it in the oven with the door ajar for about an hour more then popped it in the fridge for about 24 hours prior to serving it to my guests. Father-in-law raved about it too. Presentation was something like you'd be served up at a restaurant. My husband couldn't believe I'd made it - lol. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, which, will stay in my recipe box for all time.

It was very yummy and didn't last 2 days at our house.  I used Ivins Famous Spiced Wafers (classic philly ginger snaps) for the crust and it definitely increased the yum factor.  I tend to like my cheesecake a little bit sweeter so i added a smidge more sugar, but if you like cheesecake the way its "supposed to be" (according to my mother) then as written is great.

Really enjoyed this one.  Brought it to a work potluck and it was devoured first.  I made my own crust using cinnamon graham crackers and ginger snaps.  I doubled the recipe to fit better in my spring form pan and also evened out the layers so they were more equal.  I piped whipped cream swirls around the edge and added a homemade praline (recipe from this board) on top of each one.  Very elegant and very tasty.  I will definately make this again.

I used a 9 inch spring form pan and made my own crust from grahahm crackers.  I increased all ingredients by 1/3 and added a/3 cup sour cream.  Like several reviewers, I used 1.5 cups od the mixture(w/o pumpkin) for the bottom.  I have made this cake on 2 occasions and both times everyone like it.  I increased the cooking time to 55-65 minutes.

My first pie that I baked in my 20 years of life and it came out perfect! Its so yummy. I am a BIG cheesecake fan and this made my tastebuds wild! I used pumpkin pie mix instead of puree, but i still added the spices to give it an extra kick. I will make more to share with others, my family loved this! Woohoo! God Bless!

Very tasty, however baking it at 325 for 40 minutes is not nearly long enough. I baked it like that and it was not even close to being done. After reviewing many other recipes I have found that the most used baking temp is 350 for one hour. I did this for my second cheese cake and it turned out wonderful!! I also added just a little more than a pinch of nutmeg and cloves...

Awesome recipe!  Used 1/3 less fat Philly brand cream cheese.  Still was a pretty filling.   Took wife's advice and 'let it cool' in the oven for about 4 hours after turning it off.  (I guess that's supposed to stop the top from cracking).   Very tasty.   Will do again in 4 weeks for Christmas.

This is fantastic!  I made some alterations, as follows:  Increased the non-pumpkin batter to 1 1/2 cups, increased the sugar to 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp., increased the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon, instead of the various spices, I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, as well as 1/2 tsp of additional cinnamon, added 1/2 cup low fat sour cream to the batter to make it creamier, and the biggest change was that I baked it in mini-graham cracker shells, for individual cheesecakes, for approximately 20 minutes.  They came out looking great!!!  I am going to serve them with a dollop of whipped topping, with a little sprinkle of cinnamon, and then some caramel sauce swirled on top.  I can't wait for my party tomorrow!!

There should be 10 stars available for rating this recipe.  I have been using recipes from this website for 2 years and this is the best one I've ever tried.  I've made it for Thanksgiving the last 2 years and it's always the first one gone.  It's nice to have a pumpkin flavor without the overpowering taste or mushy texture of pumpkin pie.  This is easy, delicious and you can make it a week ahead of time (as long as you hide it from your family in the back of the freezer!).

The best pie ever!  Only problem is I have to make too many every holiday.  Once I make it I am asked if I will make a whole one for many people who try it.  I did make a couple small changes to the recipe to taste but the recipe is pretty perfect as is.  Thanks you submitter very yummy!

Without a doubt the easiest and tastiest cheesecake I have ever made!  The double layer effect is nice and the pumpkin flavor is mild.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and the result was a creamy textured and delicious dish.  Got lots of compliments on this one, it's a keeper!  Ammended 11/2005...Cutting back on sugar this year, I made this recipe with 1/2 cup of Splenda baking sweetener, it is a mix of sugar and Splenda.  It is just as good and the texture was not changed at all.  I'm happy to have this recipe to satisfy my sweet tooth during the holidays without having the dreaded sugar crash!!!

A good recipe for thanksgiving!  I adjusted the spices to my taste and increased the nutmeg (1/2 t) and cloves (1/4).  I also used the whole can of pumpkin puree!  I didn't know what to do with the other half and I doubled the recipe so it worked out well!

This is a very, very good cheesecake.   I used finely chopped pecans and gingersnaps for my crust and the combination was the perfect complement......ummmmm, good!

Just a hint to those who've ever had their Cheesecake crack:
Place a cake pan, half filled with boiled water in bottom of oven while cheesecake bakes. I helps keep the oven moist & cheesecake is less likely to crack!

Good luck & Have a Happy Holiday!

Delicious, you MUST make this! I added 1/2 sour cream. I do this with cheesecakes, as I think it adds to the texture and I think the tartness blends the flavors well. I also added a dash or two of extra spices to appeal to my tastes. The cake baked up PERFECTLY in a wet oven and took ~50 minutes. I opened the oven door and let it cool for 1 more hour, before letting cool on the counter for about 1 more hour then fridge. It looked perfect, NO cracks.

Made this for Thanksgiving at my in-laws this year. Huge success. Used a 10" spring form pan, ginger snaps to make crust, 3 - 8oz packages of cream cheese and pumpkin pie filling instead of the pumpkin puree. Was able to omitt the spices since using the pie filling. Follow directions for asembly and bake on a cookie sheet to help prevent drying. Remove from oven and let cool before removing pan sides. Will definately make again.

A good starting recipe.  I followed the advice SOUTHERNBELLE0908 posted in her review and made a few tweaks of my own.  I increased the vanilla extract to 3/4 of a Tablespoon and I folded in 1/2 Cup Sour Cream after the eggs were added and increased the pumpkin puree to 1 Cup.  I also omitted the individual spices and substituted 2 Tablespoons of 'Spice Island' Pumpkin Pie Spice.  If using McCormick or Tone's, I suggest using 3 Tablespoons.  Immediately after the puree and sour cream are folded in, pour the filling in to a 10" springform pan and place it in a water bath with boiling water half way up the springform pan.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree F oven for 50 minutes to 1 Hour or until center is jiggly like jello.  Turn off oven and open oven door and let sit for 1 hour.  Transfer to refrigerator and let sit 3-4 hours or overnight.  Serve with warm caramel sauce or vanilla bean ice cream....Yum!  Enjoy!

Just one quick question.  If I want to bake more than one cake at a time, should I change the temperature and/or the cooking time.  I want to bake two cheesecakes at once.  Thanks!

I hate pumpkin pie, but my husband likes it.I compromised with this on Thanksgiving and it was delicious.Almost tastes like the new pumpkin spice latte's at Starbuck's!Must be good - caught hubby eating it out of the pan for breakfast the next day.I made it with a ginger snap cookie crust - that really set it off.Will be an annual Thanksgiving dessert at my house!

The entire family LOVED this dessert! Even those who aren't typically pumpkin lovers said it was one of the best desserts they'd had! 
It's definitely more of a cheesecake than a pumpkin pie, the pumpkin is very subtle, and provides a nice spice to it.

I would certainly make this again for holiday dinners!

Well, I've made this recipe about 4 times in the last 2 weeks.  NEVER had one complaint, only non-stop compliments!  I tried it with both reduced fat and regular cream cheese and I've learned that it tastes exactly the same either way!  I use 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of each individual spice and pumpkin pie filling instead of puree'.  At the advice of another reviewer, I placed the cheesecake layer in the freezer while I prepared the pumpkin layer in order to get a more pronounced double layer.  I also found that the cheesecake should bake no less than 50 minutes; I didn't have any problem with a cracked top.  
Several people told me that they are not pumpkin pie fans but found the lightly "whipped" taste of the pumpkin-cheese mixture quite tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It will definitely be a regular during the holiday season.

This pie is delicious!  I used canned pumpkin topping (Libby's) but still add the spices to make it extra flavorful.  I also put more of the cream cheese frosting in the bottom layer.  A tip--don't let your cream cheese get too soft or the pumpkin layer will sink into it.

AWESOME!  I made a double recipe of this for two seperate get-togethers this weekend.  I was handing out the recipe BEFORE I had even tasted it!  THANK YOU for this great recipe.  The only modifications I made was to add a total of 1 cup of pumpkin for more pumpkin flavor, and 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, in addition to the other spices.  Everyone loved it!

This is a very good and very easy recipe.  I used Libby's canned pumpkin for the puree and it worked great.  Be sure the cream cheese it at room temp or the cream cheese so that it blends well.  A delightful taste!

This is a GREAT cheesecake.  The only thing I would add is cook it a little longer and handle it very gently to avoid cracks.  Also adding more cream cheese helped too.  YUM!

I made this for a Christmas party pot luck and it was such a hit! I followed another viewer's changes for it to fit in a springform pan and it came out deliciously! My crust wasnt nearly as thick as I wanted to be, but next time I'll just use more graham crackers (besides no one seemed to notice it at all except me). I wanted a thicker layer of cheesecake so I used 3 packages of cream cheese. I also let it bake for  an hour, then turned the heat off and cracked the door and let it sit in the oven for an hour. After it set over night, it was perfect for travel. I cannot express how much I (and everyone else at the party) LOVED this recipe. Anyone, even for myself, who's a novice baker, could make this. I'll definitely make this again (: Thank you!

Amazing!!! I changed it to 12 servings and baked it in a 9" springform pan. But I changed the cooking time to 1 hour and that was too long, it cracked! But I covered the crack with whip cream. My graham crust was: 1 1/2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 regular smart balance (melted). Processed and press into bottom of springform pan. I didn't pre-bake it! I just poured the batter on top & it was the crispiest, best graham crust I've ever made! It was either because of not pre-baking or because I used regular (instead of light) smart balance. I also tried to have the layers be the same thickness, I just eye-balled it.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a 9 in premade regular pie crust.  I folded in 1/4 cup of sour cream after adding the eggs and doubled the amount of cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg.  I baked mine on top of a cookie sheet with a bit of water in the bottom to prevent cracking.  Also, I let my pie cool in the oven with the door open for about half an hour before removing from the oven.  I then cooled it for an hour or so on the kitchen counter before refridgerating.  I had no cracks but when I went to try a piece exactly 3 hours after I put it in the fridge, it was still slightly warm.  You will need to refridgerate for at least 4-5 hours before its the perfect temperature to dig in.  I topped mine with store-bought caramel sauce and whipped cream - yum!!!!

Truly a great recipe. The only switch was that I added cinnamon to the cream cheese right in the beginning and I used pumpkin pie filling instead of the fresh pumpkin. Turned out to be very delicious!

I received such great comments from this cheesecake... friends were raving and one even asked to take some home! my husband is not a cheesecake fan but he thinks it tastes great! the 2nd time i made this i made my own gingersnap crust using a springform pan... tasted great but i should have increased recipe by 50% so that it's not so thin/flat, looks like a flan to me!
Also both times I omitted the cloves and whipped cream topping and used 1 tbsp less sugar (i find my homemade pumpkin puree sweet enough), turned out great! Great recipe, thanks Stephanie!

A huge hit at Christmas parties. I swirled the pumpkin into the mix instead of 
blending it in completely, this gave it a nice marbled look.

Very good! Mine turned out a little softer than expected, but still very tasty! I let it sit in the fridge for 5 hours and it's extremely good, I just like my cheesecake to be a little thicker and richer. But this is very light and airy, perfect for after a big meal!

For Christmas 2011, this pie single handedly restored my reputation after the sweet potatoe pie fiasco of 2010.  Baked perfectly without a crack. Thank you.  I made a few changes thanks to the reviews:
1. Eggs and cream cheese were room temperature
2. Put 2 c. of cream cheese batter in crust.  
3. I used the Libbys Pumpkin Pie filling rather then pumpkin puree. 
4. I added an additional 3 tablespoons of sugar to the batter.  
5.I used the water bath method for baking (cookie sheet with water placed pie pan on sheet).  
6. I backed for an additional 20-25 minutes.  
7.I let the pie cool in the oven with the door open and the oven off of course.

I was disappointed in the way this turned out--probably partly because I made the pie in a larger than normal graham cracker crust, and so the layers were thinner.  There was too much crust in relation to the filling, and so not enough of a "cheesecake effect".  Also the filling didn't seem sweet enough.  It was good but just not really good, as I'd hoped it would be.  I didn't even put it out at our Christmas Eve party, as I didn't think it measured up to what I'd hoped it would.  I don't think I'd try it again, as there didn't seem to be too much potential for a really great dessert there.  If I did try it again, I'd make it in a smaller graham cracker crust and add 1/4 cup sugar to the filling. I might even 1 1/2 time the filling.

It turned out very good with some alterations.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese, upped the sugar by another 1/4 cup, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was perfect for a glass pie plate I used with a homemade graham cracker crust from this site.  Wonderful.

At a very beloved, traditional Thanksgiving at my in-laws last year, I brought this as the pumpkiin pie.  Everyone wanted an extra piece and asked for it for next year!  Love combining the cheesecake and pumpkin pie.  It is not as heavy as a regular cheesecake and has great balance with the pumpkin.

I love cheesecake, but I don't love pumpkin. I was eager to try this for the holidays to please some pumpkin pie lovers and the cheesecake lovers in one. I must say, I was very impressed with this. I used a fresh pumpkin, and added very little sugar to my crust. It was very very very great. I've recommended this recipe to many of my friends, and this will be a new holiday tradition for the fall in my family.

Didn't have much flavor. I was expecting to taste both cheesecake and pumpkin pie but it tasted like a watered down or diabetic pumpkin pie. 

Also increased the cooking temp to 350 degrees like everyone else recommended and still required a full 1 hour to cook.

Made it with a homemade cinnamon graham cracker crust,  No one eat the regular pumpkin pie.  'Nuff said.

AMAZING!!!  I made this several times and everyone has loved it.  I always let the cake rest for half an hour before I put it in the oven.  I also bake it in a water bath and it hasn't cracked yet.

Couldn't be easier, couldn't be better.  Only difference I made was not to spoil these lovely flavors with Cool Whip - whip up some real cream!

Excellent!  I used a springform pan, made my own graham cracker crust.  I took the above suggestions and increased the pumpkin to about 1 can for more pumpkin flavor.  Layered about 1.5 cups of cream cheese first, then the rest is the pumpkin mixed with cream cheese layer.  I baked at 325 for about 45-50 minutes in a water bath, with the springform wrapped in foil to prevent water seepage.  After it was the right jiggle factor, I turned off the oven and let it sit inside the oven for 1-2 hours.  Take it out and let sit on the counter for a couple hours then refrigerate overnight.  No cracked cake!  Thanks for the recipe!

I am a huge fan of pumpkin cheescake, and I've tried a few of the other recipes on this site....but this one was the BEST!!

I made the following modifications:

I used 3 8oz packages of cream cheese, and I used 4 medium eggs. I used freshly ground spices, which made all the difference.

Also, I chose to marble the two colors together, rather than to layer them. Personal preference, but it was absolutely beautiful when I pulled a toothpick through to make swirls.

Thanks for such a great recipe....it will become a classic in this house!!

this is a perfect holiday recipe, especially if you go to big family gatherings where everyone brings the most traditional desserts.  it provides great variety.  i had a hard time imagining what pumpkin cheesecake would taste like; it was fabulous.  i, unlike many of the reviewers, adore both cheesecake (although it is not a dessert to eat every day or even week due to fat content and richness), and pumpkin pie (though it's sometimes difficult to enjoy pumpkin recipes other times of the year). so, this recipe combines both of those delicious qualities without being very similar to either one independently.  i added extra pumpkin, nearly doubliing it, and used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice because it was on hand and i enjoy that flavor more than the individual spices.  highly recommended!  this will be a new staple tradition, especially for the holiday season...

FABULOUS!! I put in extra sugar & lots of vanilla, quite a bit extra pumpkin & used pumpkin pie spice for all the spices. It made enough for 2 deep dish pies. 
(The second one just not as thick)
Also used pumpkin that's already ready for pies --not the solid pack pumpkin.
This is so good --you won't be sorry if you make it.

Simply excellent! When I served this to my husband and one of his friends I told them that it was a new recipe and I couldn't vouch for it as I hadn't tried it yet. After his first bite the friend said "You should vouch for it! You should definitely vouch for it!" and my husband told me to replace the traditional Thanksgiving pumpkin pie with this recipe.  Thanks for an outstanding addition to my recipe box. Don't change a thing.

I love, love, love cheesecake and for Thanksgiving I finally decided to give it a try. OMG.....was it good!! But instead of the pumpkin puree, I made a sweet potato puree. I boiled about 2-3 sweet potatoes, and all the ingredients you use when baking a sweet potato pie. 
No complaints from the family, so that means I have more to bake every year....lol!!!!

We use real whipped cream with a touch of maple syrup. I gave this recipe to my fiancee who works in a restaurant and it is the best selling item there. They make their own nut crust with walnuts and it's amazing.

Always a favorite even for the picky eaters or those who don’t like pumpkin pie.  I have also substituted the pumpkin puree with sweet potato and it worked great.

EXCELLENT!!  I made it for dessert on Christmas and everyone LOVED IT!  
I ended up baking it for about 50 minutes then turned the oven off, cracked the oven door open and the let the cheesecake cool in there- doing so prevents it from cracking on the surface and the center does not cave in.  Also, instead of adding cloves and nutmeg I added 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  It turned out great, I will definitely make this again!

I made it a little lighter using a reduced fat graham cracker crust and reduced fat cream cheese. It tasted great and was easy to make!

I'm not a big cheesecake fan but my husband and daughter are.  They loved this.  It was incredibly easy to make.  I used pumpkin pie filling instead of puree, otherwise everything else was as recommended (I did even add cinnamon and nutmeg not knowing if I should---probably shouldnt have because it was already in pie mix).  Had to cook this about 55 minutes and it was still a little jiggly in the middle but had a big crack so I figured it must be done.  It was.

Amazing, and SO simple! I loved this recipe. Just make sure to chill it for at least a couple hours. Mine was still a bit runny at 3 hours, but perfect the next day.

Very Yummy, But Not as Good as I Expected it To Be.

I thought that a pumpkin pie/cheesecake combo like this one would be even better than plain old, stand alone pumpkin pie or cheesecake.  I was wrong.

Although this is a delicious recipe that's worth trying, I found it to be a bit of a let down.  But I guess it's hard to improve on pumpkin pie!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  It was easy to make and delicious.  I garnished it with cool whip, caramel, and pecans so that it looked as good as it tasted.

As others suggested, I made two batches of the cream cheese filling, one pumpkin and one regular.  This is not a very dense cheesecake but it was still great.

the filling was pretty good and it was very simple to make but the pie took almost 50 minutes to bake and the prepared graham cracker crust was a little burnt.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was divine. Used 3 packages of cream cheese instead of 2 and baked it for about an hour in a water bath. This will be made every year for Thanksgiving from now on!

Loved it! Everyone at my party thought it was great, not too sweet but full of flavor! I did not have cloves to add to it but it still tasted great!

FANTASTIC!!! Read a lot of other reviews, and from those came up with this. Made it in a 8X8 glass baking dish so it looked more like a cheesecake instead of pie. Used 1 1/2 cups crushed cinnamon grahams, 3 Tab cinnamon sugar, 7 Tab melted margarine for the crust pressing it in the bottom and up the sides. I spread about 1/2 of the cheese mix into the crust instead of only a cup. This made the appearance of the cheese balance better with the pumpkin.  I increased the spices in the pumpkin mix to 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also mixed 2 Tab sugar into these spices before adding to the pumpkin to help the spices blend better with the wet mix. This avoids lumping of spices. I had a major oopsie and this still came out beautifully. I forgot to turn the oven back on after baking pies. After 35 minutes in a cooling oven I discovered my mistake. I left it in the oven and turned the oven back on. Came back 20 minutes later and the cake was done perfectly. What more can you ask for in a recipe? :o)

This was my first cheesecake ever, but it was easy and got rave reviews! Many reviewers have offered changes, but I would argue that you don't need to change a thing about the ingredients (except maybe to use pumpkin pie filling in place of the puree and spices - it's easier and still tasty). Also, keep an eye on consistency; my cheesecake was still liquid after 40 minutes, but it was perfect after 55 minutes, as others have recommended.

Pretty dank but I agree it is more pie-ish than cake like. But I prefer it that way. I used the honey graham cracker recipe and then used them to make the graham cracker crust recipe. With a little tweaking it turned out brilliant.  Also a pie crust cover is a good thing to invest in.

This tastes amazing! I love cheesecake & pumpkin pie.  Anything that combines these 2 flavors is just brilliant!  I made a few changes as suggested by others..  Used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, almost a whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and was generous with the spices.  Dont even need whipped topping, excellent as is.  Will definately make for this year's Thanksgiving & try the fat free/splenda version.  Yummy!!

RAVE REVIEWS!  We had a houseful of guests for Thanksgiving dinner and this was a perfect dessert for the holiday. Looking back at the recipe, I realise now that I reversed the directions!!!  I removed the 1 cup of batter and added the pumpkin, etc., to the 1 cup and spooned that on top -- too funny!  Anyway, it turned out perfectly so if anybody wanted to try that.... it works!! Intentional adjustments that I made:  increased pumpkin to 3/4 cup, omitted the cloves (didn't have any) and increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  I'll definitely be making this for Christmas - Excellent!

I found this recipe three or four years ago and tried it out for our Thanksgiving potluck, using some of the suggestions from others.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a springform pan, cooking it in a water bath.  It was a huge hit and I make it at least three times every holiday season now, always getting asked before parties if I'm bringing it!  It's really easy to make and so delicious.  I use half low fat cream cheese and half regular.  The first couple of times I made it, I had trouble getting even layers so now after pouring in the first layer, I put it in the refrigerator while mixing the second layer.  When I'm ready, I spoon in the second layer to keep it from being too heavy in any one place.  I find that I always have to cook it for almost an hour and a half, but it's worth it!!

This recipe is wonderful and easy to make.. I wanted a swirl in the cheesecake, so I took 1/2 cup of the cheesecake mixture and saved it for the swirl on top.. it was beautiful and if you can make your own graham cracker crust, please do it.. it makes a difference .. I did bake it 5 min longer than it said and it was perfect..

This has become a family favorite!  Very, very tasty...and a little twist on the traditional pumpkin pie.  I always make the filling 1/2 and 1/2, and add extra pumpkin and spices.

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and it was a snap to say the least!  It was by far the "hit" at Thanksgiving!  I'll definitely be making it again for Christmas.

After allowing my friend to read the recipe as I made it, and having him forget to tell me to take out a cup of the mix at the beginning, I made a pumkin/cheesecake hybrid, that was still very good.  The second time, after taking matters into my own hands, the pie turned out perfect and looked and tasted great!!

I often make this recipe during the Fall to take to Halloween and Thanksgiving parties. People love it. I add another brick of cream cheese to the mixture so I can have two cups of the "white" layer at the bottom so it evens out the layers a little. When pumpkin pie filling is available I just use that instead of the pumpkin puree and spices. I prefer the flavor of the filling since it already has all the right stuff spices in it.

Amazing!! This was the first cheesecake I made so I wanted it to be perfect..after reading other reviews I changed some measurements and made my own crust as well. I wanted to have a disguised cheesecake   flavor and texture along with a delicious pumpkin layer.. The changes I made were: 3 8oz packages of cream cheese, added 2T more of sugar, 1/2t more of vanilla, 3 eggs and 1 heaping cup of pumpkin puree. I baked it in a spring form pan for a total of 78 min. Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving and I will definitely be making this every year!!

**Homer drool** If anyone can picture that, that's what my family did when this landed on the table for Thanksgiving...it was delicious! Since making it exactly as the recipe stated, I actually substituted the pumpkin puree with an equal mixture of egg nog and the flavored (white chocolate) cream cheese and again...it was heavenly. Thank you so much for this recipe. We'll forever be grateful :)

I loved the recipe, I did make my own graham cracker crust, but It needs more cream cheese filling, I will make this again, but will add more cream cheese filling.

Instead of making multiple layers, which is really difficult, I just mix it all together to make a regular pumpkin cheesecake.  Great, strong cheesecake!

Yummy!  I may double the plain layer next time, though.  It nearly disappeared when the pumpkin layer was added.

Best ever!  Used the water under the pan tip and also the turn the oven off and let the pie cool gradually inside tip and it came out perfect.  I used a little less pumpkin as i personally dont like too much of it.  This is by far one of my absolute favorites!

This recipe is delicious.  The only problem I had was that it was very thin in my spring form pan, so I doubled the recipe the second time I made it.  Had to cook it for longer, but I've gotten better at telling when a cheesecake is done

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  This is the best of both worlds and always turns out perfect.  After making this last Thanksgiving, my family no longer wants a regular pumpkin pie.  This is our new Thanksgiving dessert each year.

Delicious!!  Really easy to make and everyone LOVED it!  This will be replacing our pumpkin pies and our cheesecake for the holidays!  I personally like a little more of the regular cheesecake layer so next time, I will make that part a little thicker and I also used a little more pumpkin puree....

This was a favorite at Thanksgiving.  I did follow another reviewer's advise and added pumpkin pie filling, an extra cream cheese, sour cream, spiced rum, and extra spices.  I am going to make it again and make my own crust with graham cracker crumbs and cashews (really good crust).  I also drizzled melted butterscotch chips over the pie and that really added a fabulous punch.

Amazing. This is the first cheesecake I have ever made, and I made 3 of them in one weekend. The first one I made disappeared before I could even taste a bite! My entire family raved over the texture and the light taste of the pumpkin. It's not too dense and it's not an overwhelming flavor of pumpkin = perfect! 

The next two I made also disappeared quickly - from my coworkers and another for my family. 

For those who said it didn't set - try cooking it in a water bath (so it can cook evenly and not crack). Honestly, this was not hard to make... at all. I don't even have a mixer, and mixed it all by hand. Easy!

Was a little intimidated by all of the changes that were suggested, but I made this with only a few tweeks for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! I increased the pumpkin to 2/3 cup and also increased the cloves and nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon each. I also made my own graham cracker crust. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  I have made a pumpkin cheese cake using a diferrent recipe from this sight...A far more complicated recipe.  Thie cheesecake is equally delicious and far far easier.  I made my own graham cracker-pecan crust  and used a springform pan.  Perfect.  10 stars!

A very good change-up from the regular pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. Made my own graham cracker crust, which I think improved it a lot.

This was just average. The pumpkin flavor is too subtle in my opinion thus causing the cheesecake to be a bit bland. We ate it but I won't make it again.

I would give this a 5 except that since I don't like cheesecake I can only give feedback, secondhand.  I made two of these for Thanksgiving and everyone who ate them raved about them.  I doubled the recipe for 2 pies and tossed an extra pack of cream cheese and an extra egg into the mix, based upon other reviewers.  I served with Redi-Whip, you know, cream vs. oil.  : ).

Fantastic.  My sister said it tasted very close to the one at The Cheesecake Factory.  I had to make an adjustment to the spices, because I didn't have nutmeg, I used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice, omitting the cinnamon and cloves, since all those ingredients are found in pumpkin spice. This recipe was so easy and the taste so creamy. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I will definitely be making this again! We made on turkey day, and I followed the recipe near exact and it couldn't have turned out any better.

I made my own graham cracker crust, and used all of the ingredients, except I added some pumpkin pie spice to the second layer (not sure if that was needed at all - did it more so to make the layer a darker orange color). I placed it on the center rack, and the pie center wasn't "almost set" as the directions stated until close to 45 minutes. That was in a standard Wilton pan.

Every bit was gobbled up, and it was the star of the dessert table! I will be making this recipe again - before next Thanksgiving!

I tried this recipe for thanksgiving to the T and it turned out PERFECT. It was so amazing. Everyone loved it. I had 2 peices. It is so good and easy to make. I had never made a pie or cake before so I was shocked at how simple and delicious it was! :)

This was good but not great. I was expecting to love it, but it was underwhelming. I probably wouldn't make it again.

The best thing I've ever made. I made a gingersnap-pecan crust, sprinkled extra crust bits over the top, and drizzled on a caramel sauce. Absolutely delicious!

A huge hit this Thanksgiving!
This does not make the super-dense NY style cheesecake, which makes it much better after a big meal.  I did make two small substitutions: I made gingersnap crust (2c gingersnap crumbs, 1/3c sugar, 1/4t ginger, 6T melted butter, mix well, press into pan and bake @ 350 for 5 mins), which I think gives a better flavour than plan graham cracker crust, and I used a blend of pumpkin pie spices as my family prefers a richer spice flavor in desserts.  Unlike others, I did not have any problem whatsoever with my cheesecake cracking upon cooling.
This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this 2x the week of Thanksgiving, and once I one and a halfed the recipe!!  I followed another reviewers suggestions added more cr cheese and added sour cream.  For the one and a halfed recipe, it made two cakes in the premade graham crust.  I used 4 1/2, 8oz cr cheese and 3/4 cup sour cream.  Everything else I just one and a halfed it.  I baked 50 minutes, then turned off the oven and put a pot holder, holding the oven open, for an additional 10 minutes.  Wonderful recipe:)

Very tasty!  I used a ready-made graham cracker crust and added another 8 oz cream cheese to make the bottom layer thicker.  I also used 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 eggs and pumpkin pie filling instead of puree and spices (I couldn't find puree or even pie pumpkins at the store).  I also put a rectangular glass baking dish filled 3/4 with water on a rack just below the pie (carefully, in an electric oven).  I know cheescakes are normally done in a "water bath" but nobody explained the process to me so I went with my own "humidifer" and it worked just fine...no cracks at all.  It wasn't quite done at 35-40 minutes, it was more like 45 minutes.

WOW - I wanted an alternative to pumpkin pie and I am so happy I found this.  I did add an 8 oz package of cream cheese and increased the pumpkin to a cup.  Made a homemade graham cracker/ginger snap crust and made it in a 9" Spring pan.  I also made the layers equal portions.  I did have to cook it closer to an hour but this was a HUGE hit and a definate keeper.  Served it with a simple homemade whipped cream on the side.  Oh my!

I made one yesterday, tried it this am, 1 day before Thanksgiving.  I sent out for another crust to make another one. It was perfect. I used 3 8 oz cream cheese packages, and placed 2 cups of the prepared spread. I doubled the pumpkin puree. I used Keebler's extra large crust with the extra servings. Simply divine.

I love a good thick cheesecake,but I've always been scared to make my own. I follwed SouthernBell0908 "s directions exactly except i used about 10oz of pumpkin pie filling,I wanted a rich pumpkin flavor. For the crust i made the almond graham cracker crust from (Phoenician's Key lime Pie )recipe for another twist of flavor. SouthernBell)0908 also suggets a waterbath to prevent cracking which I never have done but, worked out great.** 1 tip to have a smooth professional apperance is to smooth both layers with an offset spatual. So happy I tried this out! Thanks!

I made a couple of changes when making this. I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the main batter and then put 1 2/3 cups in the lower layer and added a little less than half a cup of pumpkin to the upper. It was perfect for a thanksgiving pumpkin pie (especially for those that don't love love pumpkin pie)

I think this was a GREAT recipe.  Made it for my family and they LOVED it.  My mom gave me some advice along the way,and the only flaw was it was REALLY jiggly when I took it out of the oven, so I would say cook it longer.  Everything else is great!!  I hope you found this useful.

Best pumpkin cheesecake ever! Here are my changes: I make my own crust using cinnamon graham crackers, butter, and a little sugar. I used 3 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs. I used more of the regular cheesecake batter on the bottom (about 1 1/2 cups). Turned out great!

I made this per request of my husband who LOVES pumpkin pie.  Took it to a potluck, where it won rave reviews and someone took quite a bit of the leftovers home (We had a small turnout!)  Anyway, I'm not as into pumpkin as my husband, but even I thought it was an excellent recipe.  I did follow some of the others' advice and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  Thank you for sharing your special recipe!!!!!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was pretty good, but not worth quite as much work as went into it. I had wanted to see and be able to taste the two layers, and in my cake you couldn't do that. I will likely switch back to a regular pumpkin cheesecake next year, but thanks for the great recipe!

this doesn't have a really strong pumpkin flavor, but it's a delicious cheesecake. went over incredibly well at thanksgiving. if you're looking for something like a pumpkin pie flavor, this isn't the right recipe, but it's a great twist on cheesecake.

Tried this with splenda and a lowfat crust  Awesome and great for people on low carb diet and need their dessert.  Used lite cool whip as well and got great reviews from all my book club members. Hubby wants it all the time. Great recipe.

This turned out just okay for me.  Unfortunately my hand mixer broke midway through so I will blame the taste on that.  It just was too much cream cheese for my taste.  It was cream cheese and pumpkin pie not, pumpkin cheesecake.  I will make this again with a new mixer, but will cut down on the cream cheese and perhaps increase the pumpkin.  As is, it is 16 ounces of cream cheese to 1/2 cup of pumpkin...that is wayyyy too much cream cheese.  I'll add less of the cream cheese, whip it a little longer so it gets fluffy and then add a bit more pumpkin

Phenomenal cheesecake!  Huge hit at Thanksgiving!  It was gone in a jiffy.  I highly suggest making with a graham crust with a hint of cinnamon!

This was wonderful.  My family all enjoyed it and my daughter has requested that I make one for her to take to work for her birthday in January.  I did make a few changes at others suggestions because we can't resist sour cream.  I used a 9" spring form pan, 3 (8oz) pkgs cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp each ground cloves & nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon.  For the crust I used 1/2 graham crackers & 1/2 ginger snaps.  It was my first cheesecake from scratch and with suggestions from others (1 hr @ 350º in a water bath then turn oven off and let it set another hour), it cooked up perfectly - not a single crack.

This is very good! I added the half cup of sour cream, another cream cheese, and a cup of pumpkin like other suggested. I also made my own graham cracker crust from a recipe on this site. It's not too heavy, and the pumpkin flavor isn't overpowering at all.. Delicious!

Really good.  Was a hit at Christmas.  Increased the puree to 3/4 cup and added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, as we really like the taste of pumpkin.  This is my third time making this.

Very good and very easy, made my own whipped cream with heavy cream and sugar and it took the cheesecake to the next level.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you couldn't tell at all! The nice thing about this recipe besides the ease, the cheesecake it not that thick it is one inch instead of 2-3 and cheesecake is so heavy to begin its nice that it is thinner.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Creamy, rich, and just enough pumpkin flavor...plus the double layers made it look so pretty!!  I made my own graham cracker crust and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the seperate spices.  So yummy...i will be making this one time and time again!!!

My husbands absolute favorite... I had to find pumpkin puree in August to make it for his birthday. I'm not a fan of pumpkin flavor but it isn't overpowering in this recipe and I agree this cheesecake is to die for.

I LOVED it! I love cheesecake and this is the perfect combination of cheesecake and pumpkin. This is the first pie I've ever made and I was pleased with how easy it was.  Like other suggestions to simplify this recipe, I used the can of pumpkin pie mix so I didn't have to add the spices.  I will make it again!

I just didn't care for it. I thought it was kind of bland...maybe not enough contrast between the cheesecake and pumpkin flavors? My family seemed to like it, though.

This was fantastic. I made it for Thanksgiving and loved it. I followed the recipe almost exactly except i used pumpkin pie spice (1 tbs) instead of the spices the recipe uses. I baked it for 50 mins, and then turned the oven off, and left the oven door open halfway to let the cheescake cool for a hour. I found that it never cracks if I cool it that way first. Thanks for sharing this one is a keeper.

I have never made a cheesecake before, so I was a bit nervous about making this. This is a super easy recipe to follow. It was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!! I will be making this every year instead of regular pumpkin pie.

AMAZING!!!  I used my own recipe for cheesecake and poured half of it into my gingersnap crust, then mixed the remaining half with canned pumpkin pie mix and carefully poured it on top of the first layer.  Very delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving and served it with warm caramel sauce.

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake and it was a success! I followed others' advise and these were my changes:  I added 1 extra 8oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of sour cream, left out the cloves but added a bit more vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste)  I baked it in a water bath at 350 for 1 full hour, then turned the oven off and left the cheesecake in the oven for another hour. I had a lot of left over batter though so next time I will buy an additional graham cracker crust and split the batter between the two. I used regular whipped cream as garnish. Delicious!

I have never made anything from scratch. This was very easy and turned out amazing!!! Wanted to test this out before Thanksgiving and I think I'm going to make it every year, its THAT good!!!! Followed others advice and used 3 (8oz) cream cheese packages, and instead of the spices, added 2 tblsp pumpkin spice. I also didn't know what pumpkin puree was so I just used a can of pumpkin. Made my own whipped cream and spread over the top of the entire cheesecake. I did use store bought crust (which was good) but maybe next time I will make that too! *NOTE* the filling makes plenty for 2 pies if using shallow store bought crust, so buy 2 crusts and make two!!

Oh my goodness!  Amazing and so yummy!!  I used a baking pumpkin and it was SO easy!  I have tried it in the 9 in. crust, as well as the individual personal size graham cracker crusts that come in a 6 pack at the grocery store.  Both were wonderful!  I LOVE this recipe and I actually froze pumpkin puree this year just so we can keep making this recipe with the fresh garden puree year round!  LOVE IT!

I've been making something very similar to this for many years. One thing I do different is top the cheesecake with about 1/4 inch of caramel or butterscotch.

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was even out the layers, so that there were equal parts cheesecake and pumpkin. I'm a cheesecake fan, so I didn't want the pumpkin to over power the cheesecake flavor. It turned out perfect!

I completely forgot to add the eggs, but it still came out marvelously!  I'm definitely going to make it again for thanksgiving this year, with eggs this time.

I made this for a co-worker for his birthday. Many people in the office said that it was the best pumpkin cheesecake they had ever had. I agree.I also used a homemade graham cracker crust and added a pinch of cinnamon-amazing!

I needed a nondairy dessert, so I substituted the cream cheese with Tofutti cream cheese. The consistency is more light. I also used Libby's pumpkin pie filling (3/4 cup) and I think next time I'll also add the spices. I also poured 1 1/2 cup of the plain cream cheese mixture to have a thicker bottom layer. I thought this was really delicious and I'm making it again for Thanksgiving! ~UPDATE~ I made this again last night with real cream cheese and realized that with the tofutti, the batter is VERY runny!! The taste is fine but it will not be as beautifully "layered" as when using the real thing.

Made this in a spring form pan with extra cream cheese and added sour cream. Read the reviews before making, I wanted more of a cheesecake than a pie and it was great!! Everyone LOVED it.

Like other reviewers, I used a homemade graham cracker crust pressed in the bottom of a 9" springform pan. Also increased the cheesecake layer by 1/3 and used Libby's pumpkin pie filling. Baked for approximately 60 min. Topped with candied pecans and caramel sauce. Turned out better than I could have imagined!

Outstanding recipe!  I made life easier on myself and used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree and the spices.  I did double the vanilla and added extra cinnamon on top and in the mixture.  When layering, I put 1 and 1/2 cups of the cheesecake mixture on the bottom to make the bottom layer a bit thicker, and then placed it in the freezer for five minutes before adding the top pumpkin layer.  Delicious and easy, will definitely make again!

Very yummy!  Easy to make. My husband said it's the best thing I've ever made.  Instead of the whipped cream, I made a dizzle topping of 1c heavy whipping cream and 3/4 c maple syrup beaten with mixer for 3 mins.  and drizzled on top, SO GOOD!!!

I love this filling in a gingersnap crust.  I also use pumpkin pie filling instead of the individual spices.  I drizzle with caramel ice cream topping an whipped cream, spinkled with toffee bits.  Fabulous!

Very good!  I wouldn't add anything to it, it's perfect as written.  If you add extra spices it will overpower the cheesecake portion.  
Very Yummy!

Easy and delicious. I added an extra 1/2 cup of pumkin and I think it is tastier using canned pumkin with spices as oppose to prepared pumkin pie mix.

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving and my 4 year old has asked me to make it again over 5 times now. My 2 year old, sho is just starting to talk a few words at a time echoes his brother by saying "punkin cees ake". So, it is a hit! Also, like to add that it was especially good with whipped cream and a little maple syrup. Excellent!

WOW!  This was awesome!  I made my graham cracker crust and I used 3 blocks of cream cheese instead of 2.  After I put the 1st layer down on the crust, I added one can of pumpkin (instead of 1/2 cup)to the remaining mix and an extra egg.  I also added extra of all the spices- we like a lot of spice :)  Baked it for an hour in a springform pan and it was wonderful!  My cheesecakes always crack, but when it is covered in whipped cream, no one's the wiser.  Very good recipe for the Holidays.  Thanks!

I am not giving this recipe any starts yet.  I can't wait until tomorrow to eat it!  I wanted to start my review now because I am so impressed with the way this looked when it came out of the oven.  No cracks!!!  I took SOUTHERNBELLE0908's suggestions and added 8 oz more cream cheese, 1/2 C more pumpkin puree, 1/4 tsp more cinnamon, 1 pinch more nutmeg and 1/2 C sour cream (added to the plain cream cheese mixture after the eggs).  I baked it in a water bath at 350 for about 45 minutes.  I used a springform pan.  I also used a gingersnap/graham cracker crumb mixture for the crust.  I will post when I eat it and assign my rating!  If it tastes as good as it looks it will definitely be a 5 star recipe in my book!

UMMMM, UMMMM, GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!  This recipe is so good and so easy to make.  I made it for Thanksgiving (for crew of cheesecake lovers) and it was gone the second I put it on the table. It was so good that I made another one the very next day.  One comment/suggestion, though - the second time I made it, I DOUBLED the recipe because, as is, the cheesecake makes very little batter and it comes out very shallow and not much of a substantial "cake".  So, just double the recipe and follow as is.  It'll only take an additional 10 minutes to bake, but use your judgment since all ovens vary.

P.S.  I didn't use a store bought pie crust, as the recipe suggested, instead I used a springform pan and made my own.

A good recipe for thanksgiving!  I adjusted the spices to my taste and increased the nutmeg (1/2 t) and cloves (1/4).  I also used the whole can of pumpkin puree!  I didn't know what to do with the other half and I doubled the recipe so it worked out well!

I think this is an excellent recipe.  I'm not much of a cook but this pie made me seem like some kind of culinary master! HAHA!!  Anyway, surprisingly enough my husband enjoyed this pie as much as I did and he's not easily pleased.  The only down-fall I would say is that it wasn't cream cheesy enough and it wasn't very sweet ( I guess which is good for some people!).  I actually put more cream cheese filling than it asked for the 2nd time around and that helped it a lot with the cheesecake taste I wanted!

Great recipe!  Definitely needs to stay in the fridge longer than 3 hours, though.  My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe (the queen of baking, herself!!!)  Will make this one again for Thanksgiving Day!!!!

I made mini versions w/the Keebler mini crusts for New Year's Eve and everyone loved them.  It's a good thing I made extra, or a fight might have ensued!  Very easy...a little too easy.  It made me think they wouldn't be very good when I was making them because they were so easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe Stephanie!

Everyone loved it! I loved it! Didn't have any ground cloves, so added a pinch of allspice instead and it was yummy. I baked 25 degrees lower and for an hour instead, and I found it turned out just perfect. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I made this for a post-football-game party, and it was a hit!  Everyone enjoyed it, and it was gone within a matter of minutes.  I topped it with a pecan half on each slice and a dollop of fresh whipped cream (real, not cool whip) and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Really fast to make, bakes easily, chill overnight and serve the next day.  I think room temperature is best.  Thanks, AllRecipes!

This reminded all of our family (13 of us) about the wonderfully delicious Pumpkin Cheese Rolls my mother used to make for us when we were small and underfoot.  MMMMMMM.... The best recipe I have found yet!

Fabulous! Every time I've made this dessert, someone has requested the recipe. As others suggested, I increased the pumpkin puree,  otherwise the flavor is very subtle. I also copied another reviewer's recipe for the crust: 1 cup graham crackers, 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg and 5 tablespoons melted butter. I use freshly grated nutmeg for both the crust and the filling. Absolutely amazing...

My primary complaint is this lacks oomph. Not enough tart flavor on the cheesecake portion and it lacks that dense, cheesy richness. Tasty- but in a sweet whipped type of way. Not enough pumpkin flavor on the second layer.  Made as-is there is nothing wrong with this recipe- still tasty and simple. But there are a LOT of 5 stars reviews here from people who made significant changes- which I think skews what you expect. I make cheesecake once a year and I want "wow". This is good, but not 5 star.

I add 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 1/2 C and 3/4 C sugar.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of separate spices.  I've made this the past 3 years and everyone loves it!

Perfect! I usually hate pumpkin pie, so I made this for Thanksgiving instead. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I loved the flavor and texture of this cheesecake and how the pumpkin wasn't overpowering at all. I actualy made this the day before Thanksgiving, but we couldn't wait so we ate it today. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING once I made a few alterations.  Thanks to TRindell for her awesome graham cracker crust recipe!  I added one extra 8oz pkg of cream cheese, added extra vanilla (1tbspn), nutmeg, cinnamon and increased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Add 1/2 cup sour cream after the eggs and increase pumpkin to 8oz, using the puree can mix.  This was so delicious I ate half of it myself!  Then my boyfriend ate the other half!

This recipe is excellent.  It is almost always regarded with skepticism at first but so far, everyone that has tried it has requested I make it again in the future.  It has become a holiday staple with us for the last several years.  My only alteration is that I never use store bought cracker or dough crust.  I have learned that crust flavor is very noticeable when it is made from scratch, while packaged crusts seem to be ignored in favor of fillings.  When I make the crust for this, I follow a standard graham cracker crumb recipe while adding roughly 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of both cloves and nutmeg.  Multiple people have mentioned the tastiness of this crust and it seems to emphasize the spices within the pumpkin cheesecake mixture.  I also serve this with real whipped cream as opposed to whipped topping.

SO easy. And had rave reviews. This is definitely the easiest cheesecake I've made, and was told by people who have had my other specialty cheesecakes that they loved that this one was their new favorite. Definitely a fun way to spice it up from a simple pumpkin pie.

Ive made this the regular way and got rave reviews. HOWEVER- if you'd like a low carb version of this recipe, nix the crust (or find an almond meal alternative), substitute Splenda, add 1/2 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup pumpkin puree. It's about 2-3 carbs per serving and you arnt sacrificing flavor!!

I don't like pumpkin pie at all, but my husband begged me to make this for him, so I gave it a shot - wow! Even I like this very much indeed. It's nice and light and flavorful, and so easy to make. He was so crazy about it that this is now on my permanent list of Thanksgiving desserts.

i really enjoyed the flavour but i prefer a lighter cheesecake.  For the cream cheese mixture I mixed 500 g of room temp cream cheese with 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 eggs.  I put 1.5 cups in the bottom of the crust.  This ended up giving about a half and half layer division.  For the pumpkin misture I added 3/4 cup pumpkin puree with 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of cloves, a pinch of nutmeg and 1 tbsp of spiced rum.  I baked the cheesecake at 325 for 50 min, turned off the oven and opened the door but left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour.  I then refrigerated it.

This is easy and everyone loves it! In addition to the original version, I made a vegan version, substituting fake cream cheese and egg replacer. It turned out great, and my vegan daughter loved it for Thanksgiving!

This was a great Thanksgiving dessert.  I used an extra 4 oz of cream cheese, an additional 1/4 cup of pumpkin, and increased all the spices.  I made my crust in a 9 inch cake pan.  Baked in a water bath at 350 for about 40 minutes.  The plain cheesecake layer was a little too small to really taste.  Next time I will use gingersnaps for the crust and will reserve the plain cheesecake batter to make a pumpkin swirl cheesecake.

This was very tasty considering how quick and easy it was to make, thats why it gets 5 stars. BUT, i've had better with homemade crust. So, in a time crunch this is 100% the way to go. Very tasty.

I have never been a big pumpkin pie eater, so this Thanksgiving I decided to try something else with a pumpkin flavor. My family is all for the original cheesecake so they were a bit pessimistic about trying this. Once they did this cheesecake was gone in about an hour! The only recommendations I would make is that if you prefer more original cheesecake, and less pumpkin flavor, that you should make the bottom layer deeper than the top layer ( which is the layer that has the pumpkin flavor). I think that’s the only change I’d make in the future, as well as making my own gram cracker crust. Either way I think it’s a great cheesecake!

Great recipe!! My favorite cheescake yet and I make them all the time since cheescakes are my husbands favorite.  I did use 3 packs of cream cheese like others had recommended, and added 2 tbs of sugar to the 1/2 cup, I also added a bit more cinnamon.  I decided to make a ginger snap crust with pecans it came out great!  Adds so much to the cake.  Crust: 1 1/2 cup gingersnap crumbs, 1/2 c crushed pecan, 3 tbs melted butter, 1 tbs brown sugar.  Mix all ingredients and place into bottom of spring pan, bake for 5 min at 350f then let cool, place in freezer to completely cool.

This was very good.  Though this was not my first choice (I usually bake my cheesecakes in a springform pan) but it turned out just fine.  My only complaint would be that maybe a little more cream cheese would be better.  I'm not a huge pumpkin fan and it was a little too much for me.  Everyone in the family that loved pumpkin thought it was fabulous.

This is very yummy! I used Libby's pumpkin pie mix instead of adding all the spices separately. I used 1 cup of it which is more than other people suggested but I like the pumpkin flavor. :)

My family loved this! First cheesecake I've ever made and it blew everyone away. I followed other suggestions to use Pumpkin Pie filling instead of the puree. I also made the cheese layer thicker than the recommended amount. The layers were perfect and I can't wait to make this again!

I have never made cheesecake before so was pretty nervous to have my first attempt be for Thanksgiving but after reading all of the reviews and tips, I decided to go for it.  HUGE SUCCESS!  I used a springform pan and made a gingersnap crust.  I upped the cream cheese to 3 packages.  I used 3/4 c. of pumpkin pie filling rather then the puree and all of the spices.  I love pumpkin flavor so I added about 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I cooked for 55 minutes at 325 degrees, then turned off the oven to cool down.  I left it on the counter for another hour and then to the fridge it went.  Not one crack.  My in-laws, who aren't big pumpkin or cheesecake fans asked me to leave them the pie and we could take the turkey leftovers.  They loved it as did my picky son and husband.  It was so easy!

This is a good pie. If you like cheesecake it is really good. I felt like it didnt have enough pumpkin flavor so next time I am going back to the layer of cheesecake and the layer of pumpkin pie. If I put in more pumpkin on the top layer I would have liked it even more. However, everyone else loved it so it was still a big hit. I covered it with whipped cream then sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on it for decoration and it looked great!

Absolutely amazing! I followed SOUTHERNBELLE0908's suggestion of more creamcheese, pumpkin, and added sour cream. I also added 1 tsp rum extract.  I lightened the calorie load a bit by using 2 fat free cream cheeses and one 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Also used fat free sour cream and milk. Still good and creamy and thick. I also used reduced fat cinnamon graham crackers for the crust, omitted the extra sugar and decreased the butter to 3/4 of a stick. Light whipped cream tastes exactly the same as regular in my opinion, and this cheesecake absolutely deserves 5 stars. Thanks for sharing it with all of us!!

Im not a fan of pumpkin pie but I LOVE cheesecake. I had a few jars of pureed fresh pumpkin in the fridge that I needed to use so I decided on this recipe. I made a crust with gingersnaps and added a bit more pumpkin to the top layer than called for. As of last night my son and I were the only two to have tried this and we LOVED it. Will definately make this again, but next time will double the filling so the layers are a bit more equal.

This was a really great recipe. I made a few adjustment suggested by the first reviewer. I put in three (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream as well as I added an extra half a cup of pumpkin puree. It turned out really creamy and flavourful. I made a homemade caramel sauce--butter, brown sugar and whipping cream--for a topper. It was so delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe. Use half and half for the layers, much better when there is equal amounts of plain cheesecake/pumpkin layers.

Also try using gingersnap cookies instead of graham crackers for the crust.  Either way it still gets 5 stars!

I made this when hosting a small group from our church the other night.  It was great!  I made a home made crust, added 1/2 cup sour cream after the eggs & increased vanilla & cinnamon to 1 tsp. I used a water bath & made sure the cream cheese & eggs were room temp.  This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe several times now, for both my family and some of my college friends.. and every time I make it..it is a huge hit!  What is amazing is how easy it is (but everyone thinks you worked really hard)!  It is a little dense so you can only have a small slice :-)

An excellent recipe!  Because our family is primarily lactose intolerant, we substituted the cream cheese with a non-dairy variety which turned out perfectly!

I made this for Christmas Eve at the in-laws & it went before the pumpkin pie.  I took some advice from others & used 3 8oz blocks of cream cheese, 1 1/4 c sugar and I used an entire small can of the pumpkin pie filling.  I also folded in some sour cream & added a little extra cinnamon & nutmeg (after taste testing).  I just eyeballed the cream cheese filling the pie crust about 1/2 way.  Then I put the pumpkin flavor mixture on top.  It ended up being about 1/2 & 1/2 which was perfect for our taste.  I made a topping favorite in our house which is 1 cup brown sugar & 1 cup heavy whipping cream simmered together to thicken and let them put it on top themselves.  I have some of the pumpkin flavored mixture left so today I will be making a cheesecake in a springform.....can't wait!

I didn't really like this.  It just didn't have much flavor to it even after I added extra pumpkin.  It looked cool, but it wasn't what I hoped for.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Excellent!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only alteration I made was to double the spices and cook in the water bath.  Tasted great and had no cracks.

this was absolutely amazing!!! definitely a hit at thanksgiving dinner. i had extra filling so i made a second pie by layering the first layer with the pumpkin cheesecake filling and then the top layer was just whipped topping. they both came out amazing.. the double layered cheesecake was good for cheesecake lovers and the pumpkin cheesecake with whipped topping pie was a great alternative for relatives who prefer a not so heavy cheesecake. great recipe.. oh i also used pumpkin spice and i upped the cream cheese to 3 packets.

I made this gluten free by crushing GF cookies to make the crust with. The pumpkin flavor is mild and the texture is cheesecake smooth. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is so good. I did use 1 c. of the chhesecake filling on the bottom layer & the rest was mixed with 3/4 c. of the pumpkin puree. I used 11/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Baked it at 350 for 1 hr. It DID crack ,but that is not a big issue. The flavor was just so good. I never made a  cheesecake before so I was very impressed. tHANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE.

I never made this cheesecake following the directions. I am on my third cheesecake and it is a work of art. First you need to buy gram cracker crumbs and make the crust. Firmly lay it down in the bottom of a well-greased springform pan. Next you need to put 4 (8 oz) containers of cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and begin to beat. Add sugar and Vanilla (same amount as the directions) after you have a smooth texture add the 2 eggs. Once you have the eggs in add an ENTIRE can of pumpkin pie filling. Then add cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and a tad bit of allspice. Cook about 45 min at 325 leave cheesecake in oven (turned off) while still warm for an hour. Will not crack. This is the perfect cheesecake, promise!

The cheesecake needs more sugar, and it does not have enough pumpkin flavor. It was ok for us, nothing out of this world. I will probably not make this recipe again, but will try to alter it to find a better flavor and consistency.

This cheesecake is delicious!  My entire family loved it.  The graham cracker crust is a nice counterpart to the creamy pumpkin cheesecake filling.  I will definitely make this again.

I LOVED this recipe!!! It was so amazing that I personally think it is much better than just a plain old pumpkin pie. The only thing we do differently is instead of a graham cracker crust we used a ginger snap crust. 1 1/2 cups crushed ginger snaps, 1/3 cup sugar and one stick of butter. It made the flavors really jump out! This is my favorite recipe on here : )

I'm only giving this a 4 because I haven't actually tried the cheesecake yet - I'm saving it for my family dinner tomorrow. Wanted to give some input on the prep though - I used a pre-made Keebler deep graham crust. I took everyone's advice and added a 3rd 8oz cream cheese, 3/4c sugar, still only 2 eggs, 1/2c sour cream, and added the pumpkin and spices to taste. It was too much! I actually made 6 full cupcake-sized  mini cheesecakes using what was left over (I crumbled crushed Oreos on the bottom of the cupcake papers for crust). The minis are quite delicious, I think the cake will be too! But if you plan to use a pre-made crust, I would follow the original recipe, with the addition of the sour cream.

I TRIPLED THIS RECIPE FOR OUR THANKSGIVING LUNCHEON TODAY.  AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!!! I DID TWEAK IT CAUSE I'M A SWEET POTATO PERSON.  I USED A 28 OZ CAN OF SWEET POTATO PIE FILLING INSTEAD.  I ALSO ADDED A PINCH OF ALLSPICE.  I ALSO FOLLOWED A REVIEWER AND SCOOPED OUT A CUP AND 1/2 OF THE CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE TO SPREAD IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CRUST.  AND BECAUSE I WAS MAKING A SPICE CAKE THAT WANTED MY EGGS TO BE ROOM TEMP, I SAT MY EGGS FOR THIS OUT TOO, ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE AWESOME OUTCOME OR NOT.  I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY COPIES OF MY TWEAKED RECIPE I HAD TO HAND OUT TODAY!  5 AND COUNTING!!  I WILL BE MAKING MANY MORE OF THESE NOW RENAMED "DOUBLE LAYER SWEET POTATO CHEESECAKE"!!!

Very good, but instead of graham cracker crust (which I only use for apple cheesecake), use gingersnap cookies.  Crush them up like you would with the crackers, add the butter the same, and press into the pan.  So much better and adds a sweet crunchy texture that is just amazing.

Since making this all my friends have required this as their birthday cake. If you're making this, really, why not make two? A tip is that if you're going to increase the pumpkin to a full 15oz can MAKE TWO. I made the mistake of making one with the whole 15oz (as suggested by another reviewer) but I ended up with 1.5 pies, which doesn't really work out. Next time I used the 15oz of pumpkin and added one extra package of cream cheese - worked out perfectly.

this was a easy cheese cake to make and was very tasteful.  I always cut back on the sugar in all recipe and did with this but ,I did think the full 1/2 cup of sugar would have been better. I think next time I will use a pumpkin pie filling so I dont  have to have all the seasoning and since I like the plain cheese part better then the pumpkin cheese I will be mixing the 1 cup with the pumpkin and using the  rest of the cheese mix on the bottom

Yes, it is as good as they are saying.  It is easy too.  Delicious.  I make pumpkin cheesecake every year for the hubby's birthday.  This is the best recipe I have found.   *hint* It tastes better with a ginger snap crust.  Just make it like you would make a graham cracker crust, only with ginger snaps.

DELICIOUS! This is the 1st time I made this cheesecake & my whole family raved! Now they want me to make it for our Thanksgiving dinner! I ended up baking it for 1 hr. instead of 40 min. Maybe my oven doesn't bake as well.

I followed the recipe as is and it was delicious. To get that double layer look, I followed some other reviews and refrigerated the crust and bottom layer for about 10 minutes which didn't give it enough time to really give it the double layer look but it was absolutely delicious regardless.

We loved this recipe! However, we did make some changes....first off we used a gingersnap cookie crust (the ginger complimented the spices in the pumpkin cheesecake wonderfully). Then we decided to make mini cheesecakes and just put the crust in muffin tins. We spooned a heaping teaspoon of original cheesecake batter for the first layer into every cup. For the pumpkin cheesecake layer we added twice as much pumpkin and spices-but add a little bit in a time and taste as you go so as not to add too much! The result was a beautifully vibrant orange pumpkin creamcheesey goodness that was basically Autumn in a fluted cup. Cheers :)

This was a great cheesecake! based on what other reviewers said, I used 3 packages of cream cheese, rather than two, a small container of sour cream, about 8 oz. of pumpkin and I added more sugar to taste. People said it wasn't as firm as regular cheesecake--and it wasn't, it was more creamy, not as stiff. It still had that rich, cheesecake vibe going, and because of the pumpkin element people didn't mind.   Thanks!!!! I'll definelty keep this recipie around!

When I make this I don't bother separating it at all.  I just blend it all together to pour into the crust.  I also buy the keebler graham cracker crumbs and follow the recipe on the box for their crust.  By doing the crust this way it's much richer and everyone raves about it.  Sometimes I will take caramels and evaporated milk and melt them in the microwave and spread the sauce over the cheesecake once it's cooled as well.  Either way it's fabulous!

Really a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I read the other reviews and did as some suggested.  I added a package of cream cheese and used 1 cup sugar instead of 1/2 c.  I also used about a cup of pumpkin pie filling.  Also made a graham cracker crust.  Wonderful.  More of a cheesecake flavor with a bit of pumpkin pie on the top.

Absolutely amazing! I did add a tad bit of rum extract to the pumpkin filling, and added one more cream cheese than called for, so then I upped the sugar to 3/4 cup.  also added sour cream in with the cream cheese which gave it an authentic cream cheese taste.  Added a little more pumpkin as well. Used all low fat products.  I hate altering recipes and then rating them 3 or 4 stars.  But because I think this pie would be good without my alterations as well, I am giving it a 5.  My pie didn't crack, it looked beautiful!  DELICIOUS!

This was my first ever cheesecake and was a bit hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  I did take the suggestions and doubled the amount of bottom layer, addded 3/4 c sugar, 1/4 c sour cream, and 1 c pumpkin and more spices.  I made a homemade graham cracker crust in a springform pan.  It turned out great.  Next time i think i'll add the extra cream cheese because the top was rather large.  It was excellent and did bake a full hour.  Yum.
UPDate(1/20/12): I made this for Thanksgiving and added another pkg of cream cheese and 1/2 c of sour cream.  I also took another's advice and used an oven bag around my spring form pan to protect it in the water bath--and it was genious!  I had no cracks this time with the bath.  THANKS!

This was oh so good!  I added 1 cup of pumpkin because I had so much pureed pumpkin in my house and then just doubled the amount of spices.  I also added an extra 8 oz of cream cheese because any time that I have made a cheesecake with less than 3 boxes, I just haven't cared for it.  So for personal preferences, I added.  I am sure it would have been great without any additions.  I did the water bath and NO cracks! :)  It was a VERY good cheesecake!

Delicious!  I changed it up a bit, just one package of cream cheese and a whole cup of pumpkin.  It set really nicely and was one of the best desserts I have ever made.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was very good and very easy.  The only change I made was to make my own crust.  I used 1 3/4 cup crushed cinnamon graham crackers combined with 1/3 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup sugar and presed it into a spring form pan.  For Halloween I topped it with black icing in the form of a spider web.

This recipe is ridiculously easy and super delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and served with caramel and whipped cream.  I don't normally like cheesecake, so I appreciated the mildness.

A few years ago, I found a similar recipe from this site (I can no longer find it), that had directions to make your own crust with 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 crushed pecans and 2 tbps butter.  Bake in the oven 10 minutes.  It's a great crust!

Honestly, I only used the "idea" of this recipe. I used my own cheesecake recipe & added pumpkin and spices to half the batter to make the two different layers. Then I topped the cake with candied pecans & carmel sauce,recipes from other reviewers. It was delicious!

I love this recipe.  It is not at all difficult.  The spices are fine for adults but I use less spices when I serve it to kids.  I always turn off the oven and keep the door closed to allow it to cool slowly whenever I make cheese cake.  This is a great recipe especially in the fall!

Just not impressed. The pumpkin layer and the cheesecake layer had no real flavor. It was simply bland. I even added extra spices.

This was a great tasting cheesecake but I also think a few changes needed to be made.  First, to reduce the fat content, I used low fat philly cream cheese and there is absolutely no difference in taste.  Second, add an extra nuttier taste to the crust by brushing it with whipped egg white and baking it in the oven at 375 for 5 min.  Last, I added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla to punch up the taste, especially in the pumpkin layer.  I followed the recipe to a tee the first time and found it just a tad bland but after I added an extra pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves, it tasted much better.  If I could give 4.5 stars, I would've!  Bon appetite!

I used this recipe to make mini cheesecakes. I followed the directions in terms of ingredients (except I used a can of pumpkin pie filling instead of puree + spices), but then I put paper muffin cups into muffin tins, packed a little granola crust into the bottom (graham cracker crumbs mixed with butter until it can be patted down and stays in place, not crumbly), added the cheese filling until the muffin cup was 2/3 full, and then carefully spread some pumpkin pie filling over the top until the filling came to just under the edge of the muffin cup. Then I baked them for 15 minutes at 350F. They turned out awesome and didn't even need whipped cream. :)

I made twelve of the mini cheesecakes and still had batter left over so I mixed the remainder of the can of pumpkin pie filling with the remainder of the cheese filling, and poured that into muffin cups (I didn't bother doing a granola crust). Those took about 13 minutes to bake (350F) and were excellent too. :)

I left both tins in the oven after they were done cooking (turn off the heat and crack the door open to let the heat escape) to cool for about an hour before transferring them to the fridge.

Do not mess with this recipe! It is perfect as is. The only changes I made was to omit the ground cloves, since I didn't have any. If you would like to save a few extra calories, you don't even need to add the whipped topping! It's just as good without it. The only negative thing that I could possibly say was that the top "cracked" after I took it out of the oven. But who cares how it looks, the taste is what matters! YUMMM!

Really good spin on plain Jane pumpkin pie. Not too sweet, not too tart. Really good. One thing I did different was sprinkle a little brown sugar on the top before baking it. This gave it a pretty marble effect.

This was very easy to make and came out wonderfully. I used 3 packages of cream cheese, and did have a bit left over (enough to make 6 cupcakes). Next time I'll stick to 2 packages. The cheesecake was rich and moist. However, I followed the reviewers comments and used 1 1/2 cups of cheesecake on the bottom layer, and I felt like the overall cake was lacking in pumpkin flavor. I think I'll use the recommended 1 cup cheesecake batter next time. All in all, delicious!! I wish I could eat this all the time!

This is a great recipe! I'm always being asked to make it again, especially by my husband. I also used real pumpkin and kicked up the spices (adding a dash of salt kicks up all the flavors)I also baked it in a water bath. I make it with a gingerbread cookie crust which also adds some spice!

This delicious! I have request for this cheesecake over the holidays. Last year I actually sold a couple because so many people asked me to make them! I actually add one cup of sugar and one cup of pumpkin puree. I like to really taste the pumpkin. I also don't make a double layer, I just make it all pumpkin.

very fast and easy. I had a ready made crust that was a bit bigger than the 9" the recipe called for (a new product;it said it had two extra servings and is by Keebler)...so I used a whole cup of pumpkin. I took the pie out of the oven when it was done, and it immediately started to crack. I put it right back in to cool, left it for 2 hours, and the cracks healed.  Should have listened to other reviewer.  Very delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe and the review page is full of very helpful tips. This has got to be the most succesful cheesecake I have ever made. I did the water bath and cooled it with the oven door cracked open. I also made this cheesecake sugarfree with sugarfree shortbread cookie crust, which is store bought sugarfree cookies crushed in the food processor and a few tablespoons of splenda and butter, and splenda for all other sugar called for in the recipe. Truly wonderful thank you.

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I am making it again for Christmas. I loved it and so did the whole family. I think I will take 1/2 the batter out this time to make the bottom layer of the cheesecake more distinct but other than that A+++

Made it this thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  They barely touched the regular pumpkin pie because everyone wanted to try the cheesecake.  Used a water bath.  It came out pretty good, but next time I think I'd let it cook an extra 10 minutes or so to be a bit firmer.

This was great. A friend reccomended it after I was complaining that everytime I made pumpkin cheesecake, it was pretty "blah". I opted to make my own crust out of gingerbread graham crackers, and used a springform pan so it would take the shape of a cheesecake instead of a pie.

I love this recipe because it is so easy.  I get so many compliments everytime I make it.  The ingredients are inexpensive.  Everyone who tries it is always amazed that it only took me about 15 minutes to whip it up.

Wow, I can't believe my opinion is so different from the majority here. I can't even give this an average rating, let alone five stars. I love pumpkin pie and I love cheesecake; but NOT this one.

This is a great recipe. I crushed shortbread & ginger snaps together with melted butter for the crust and it was out of this world. This is the second time I've made this and it's both simple & delicious. Enjoy!

I have had way better. The cream cheese layer wasn't really a good layer. won't make this pie again. I made it for my boyfriend's mom's birthday and she loved it. But I have made better.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used can pumpkin pie mix (which has all the ingredients in it.). I melted white chocolate wafers and painted the chocolate on the backsides of leaves. When the chocolate dries you just carefully peel the leaf off and you are left  with white chocolate leaves to decorate your cheesecake and plate with. Yummy and very chic looking.

oh my gosh...this cake scored me major points with my mother-in-law at Thanksgiving.  She loved it, and so vicariously loves me even more.  I brought this to a party and got major phone numbers...this cheesecake has magic powers.

So wonderful!  I just found this recipe again.  I used it for a Thanksgiving two years ago when I was responsible for dessert at my boyfriend's family dinner.  Naturally, I was nervous, and I had never made a cheesecake before, but this was pretty easy and really delicious.  I can't wait to have an excuse to make it again.  It looks so wonderful too, it's a great show-off dessert.

This was WONDERFUL!  I did add a 1/4 of brown sugar and in turn lowered the amount of white sugar added. I made the crust--crush about 20 grahmam crackers mix with white sugar (to taste) and 1/4 cup melted butter.  Press into pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  Homemade crust makes a big difference!  After the pie has baked 40 minutes, turn oven off and let cool in the oven with the door closed for 30 minutes..then cool completely on wire rack before chilling in fridge over night.  Your family and friends will BEG for the recipe! =)

This was so good!! I've never been a fan of pumpkin pie but like cheescake. I also used pumpkin pie already spiced, and was out of vanilla. I added a little extra cinnamon. I took to my bunko group and it was a hit, my husband was upset because he did not get any so i'm making again tommorow and for Thanksgiving

I made this cheesecake the other day. This recipe is a little different than the one I usually make around this time of year. I was suprised to see how well the prepared graham cracker crust did in the end. It was cracked all over when I poured the filling in. The results were fabulous. I will make sure that I spread my first layer on the bottom a little more evenly so that you can see both layers in each slice. I didn't even need the whipped cream!

I made this for a death in the family because I wanted pumpkin pie flavor, but I didn't want to use whipped cream.  This was the perfect solution.  All of the taste with no real need for the whipped cream.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe 2 years in a row now, and EVERYONE loves it.  There is rarely leftover pieces.  I add about 3/4 cup of Pumpkin instead of the 1/2 cup to make it more pumpkiny.
Try it you wont regret it.

Was easier than a lot of pumpkin pies, would increase recipe by a third perhaps, not enough filling.

This has been the best recipe.  I made it over the holidays and now anytime family get together they want my cheesecake.  I also change the pumpkin w/ blueberry pie filling and it is fantastic.  Try it, you'll love it!

Thank you Stephanie! Thanks a whole bunch. :) I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I made it with my boyfriend who is not that experienced with baking/desserts and we had a blast. It was pretty much fool-proof, and it came out perfectly. 

People who don't care for pumpkin loved it, kids loved it, picky people loved it...I will be keeping this one and making it again and again. This recipe rocks. I can't say enough. If anyone has a doubt about trying this...doubt not, make it and you'll love it too. :)

Made it exactly as written over a gingersnap cookie crust (2 cups ground gingersnap cookies, 6 tbsp melted butter, mix them together and press into the bottom of pan, baked in water bath at 325.  It was so easy to prepare and tasted amazing. Great recipe

I expected more based on the other reviews. I thought that it was lacking flavor and that the texture was a bit to be desired. Once the pumpkin and spices are added, it isn't really cheesecake-y at all. It was super easy, but it definitely fell into the "ok" pile for me. I'm going to keep searching and probably won't make it again.
One week later... I'm revising my review. I froze the pie and took it out to eat a week later. After sitting for a while it developed a much better flavor and texture. I increase my rating from 3 to 4 stars and will probably make it again. I also made homemade crust - so easy - 10 graham cracker sheets, 7 Tbsp butter 3 Tbsp sugar.

I tripled this recipe, to fill a springform pan as well as 12 large cupcakes.  For a crust in the cupcakes, I dropped one Nilla Wafer cookie into the bottom of each cupcake liner.  The crust for the springform pan was crushed Nilla Wafers with some melted butter stirred in, and pressed into the bottom of the pan.  BATTER ADAPTATION:  Tripled basic recipe as is, pouring bottom layer.  Then added a WHOLE CAN of pumpkin puree, (no leftovers!), plus one additional egg.  A bit heavier on the spices than the recipe calls for.  I made fresh whipped cream with a pinch of vanilla and a wisp of powdered sugar.  Can't abide by the MSG-laced, fake-o whipped topping route.

With these adaptations, this recipe is a keeper!

Amazing taste. I added one extra tablespoon of cinnamon, also used fresh pumpkin puree. Love the simple and easy recipe.

EDIT: I have now made this several times and it continues to be a hit. I have increased the pumpkin puree to 3/4 cup because we love more of a pumpkin taste. Also I use full fat cream cheese, love the creamier texture.

My first cheesecake. It turned out great! I am at a high altitude (10,000+ ft) and wasn't sure what changes to make. I didn't time it. I just cooked it a little more than 40 min til it looked done to me (someone who never cooked  cheesecake before). But, it turned out great.

This recipe was easy enough to make but wasn't  a hit. It didn't have enough pumpkin flavor and was really "cheesy" and less like cheesecake. If I make it again I will add more sugar and twice as much pumpkin and seasonings.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out amazing! I've made cheesecake in the past, and I could never get it to turn out right, but this recipe was so simple. I have made this cheesecake 3 times since I found the recipe, and it gets devoured every single time.  This is a great substitute for the typical pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. I will definitely continue making this for years to come.

This was the first pie I have made- ever- and it turned out delicious! It was easy, yet still impressed my friends! I followed the recipe exactly- but followed one reviewer's advice to freeze the cream cheese layer while preparing the pumpkin layer. I will definitely be making this one again!

I read the reviews first, and made a few alterations. It came out AMAZING. 

What I did:
- Use 24 oz cream cheese
- After adding eggs fold in 1/2 cup sour cream
- Used (1) 15 oz. can of " Libby's Pure Pumpkin"
- Used approximately a tbps of Pumpkin pie spice in the pumpkin mixture, and added a little more cinnamon.

I made my own graham cracker crust:
-1 1/2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs
-1/3 cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons butter; softened/melted
- Mix and press into bottom & sides of springform pan

I baked the cheesecake at 350 for 1 hour, and propped the door open after to allow it to cool for an additional hour before putting it in the refrigerator. I also instead of using your "standard" water bath filled the bottom of a broiling pan with water and put it on the rack under the cheesecake. I've always done this, and It always seems to work great & is far less time consuming than wrapping your spring pan up.

All in all loved it!

First time I made this recipe I split the ingredients in half and made 6 mini cheesecakes in a decent sized muffin pan. with a little whipped topping it looks too cute!

This was really good, but next time I'll need to decrease the time a little I think, cuz it turned out a little dry. I followed the recipe except for using pie filling rather than the puree.

Yummy!  This was a bit of work but so worth it in the long run.  Despite my best efforts and all the suggestions, my cheesecake cracked.  I let it cool overnight and was able to press the cracks together.  I topped mine with caramel sauce and mini-graham cracker squares and the cracks weren't even noticeable. It went for $30 at our office holiday food auction.

My first cheesecake, and it was pretty good! Maybe it's just me, but it didnt seem to have alot of pumpkin taste. Actually, I dont mind because pumpkin isnt my all-time favorite, but if you really like pumpkin, maybe add more spices, and/or pumpkin to the recipe. Also, I had to cook mine for about 65 minutes, no big deal, but good thing I had the time and wanst in a rush. 
Definate two thumbs up for the presentation, I love the double layer look!

This cheesecake is absolutely AMAZING! IT was a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner last night.  I doubled the recipe to fit in a springform pan (filled to the top)and made my own graham cracker crust using the ingredients found in another comment (2 c graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c crushed walnuts, 6 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp ground nutmeg, 10 tbs melted butter - mixed everything together and pressed firmly into the bottom and sides of the butter-greased springform pan; then baked it for 8 minutes at 350). I poured 3 cups of the plain filling in the prepared crust and then mixed the pumpkin in the remaining batter.  I increased the cooking time about 15 minutes, watching carefully, and it came out perfect... no cracks, nothing overcooked.  The cooled completely before putting in the firdge.  I made it 2 days before thanksgiving and kept it in the springform wrapped in clingwrap until last night when it was ready to be presented.  It looked so BEAUTIFUL - so professional looking! I wish I had taken a picture myself so I could share.  Mark my words! Double the recipe but don't change a thing, use the crust recipe above (I cannot take credit for that at all) and use the butter-greased springform.  It will come out absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I promise!

Yummy!  Easy and quick to make.  Wanted a change and made this as "practice" for Thanksgiving....this'll work.  Light and tasty not too sweet.  Keeper...thanks.  Made exactly as written.  Will probably go heavier on spice next time.

I thought it was really good but it did need more cheese cake flavor if you ask me. Still, My husband loved it.

Everyone loved it! Making it again this year for Thanksgiving.  I used our own pumpkin puree from our Halloween pumpkins and Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, because I had it on hand.

I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. This was too in-between for me to love it, not enough like cheesecake or pumpkin pie. I generally made it as the recipe described but, based on some reviews, used a larger size graham crust, which was not necessary. A regular size crust would be fine. I put a little more than 1 cup of the cream cheese mixture in the bottom layer, and added more pumpkin to the top layer. I topped with Cool Whip and toasted walnuts. It was fine, and my guests liked it, I was just underwhelmed. I probably will not try this one again.

Wow, I don't even like pumpkin, and this was so good! I made modifications suggested by Southernbelle. I used 3 8-oz blocks of cream cheese and added 1/2 cup light sour cream (add sour cream BEFORE the eggs; once you add the eggs  you want to mix as little as possible to not beat in so much air - that's one of the things that can make your cheesecake crack). I upped the sugar to 3/4 cup since I used the extra cream cheese and added about 1 teaspoon vanilla. I made my own graham cracker crust and pressed into bottom and halfway up sides of 9-inch springform pan. I put just a little over half the cream cheese mixture in the pan, then added nearly an entire 15 oz can of pureed pumpkin to the remaining filling with the spices (far more than the recipe called for: at least 2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg and cloves, and another teaspoon or so apple pie spice, which as allspice in it too). I baked in 325 oven for 45 minutes, then turned oven off and let stand in there for another hour, cracking open the over door after 20 minutes or so. The cheesecake didn't crack at all, and it was moist and creamy and not too "pumpkiny." Perfect fall dessert!

Soooo yummy! I made the following alterations: 3 packages of cream cheese, 1 cup of pumpkin purée, and a few extra tablespoons of sugar. I split the mixture about half and half and it turned out great! Soo creamy and delicious!

Absolutely delicious. Always a hit around the holidays. Like others have suggested, I used 2 cups instead of one cup of plain cheesecake mix at the bottom to make the layers more pronounced

Just an FYI...followed recipe exactly and when it came to spreading the cheesecake mixture on the graham cracker crust...HA...not happening. The crust kept coming up from the bottom and stirring into the cheesecake mixture. There was no way it was going to "spread". Had to "dollop" it on and hope for the best. Its been in the oven over an hour now and the whole thing is still very jiggly and unset. Will need at least another 30 minutes to cook.

I love this recipe but made some of the changes suggested including upping the cream cheese, pumpkin puree, and making my crust from scratch. I also like sour cream on my cheesecake and cool whip on my pie so  made a fluff topping using powder sugar, sour cream, and cool whip mixed together. Once topped, I cooled it in the fridge for an hour before serving. This way has become such a favorite that I am making multiple for each of ym thanksgivings this year!

I have made this cheesecake for the last couple of Thanksgivings. If you love pumpkin pie and cheesecake, then you will love this recipe. The only thing I don't do is the bottom layer, I just mix it all together. Make sure the cream cheese is room temperature so it mixes well with the other ingredients.Enjoy!

I baked this cheesecake last night and it was fantastic. I made it almost exactly as is, even though I did add a little more of the spices (I like my pumpkin desserts pretty spicy) and an extra 1/4 cup of the pumpkin, since some people commented it was too mild. It turned out great. Allow a little more baking time if adding more puree (5 extra minutes). This is my new holiday fave!

This was superb! And soooo easy to make. I reserved a little extra of the cream cheese mixture and set it to the side, then dropped by spoonfuls on top of the pumpkin layer and swirled through to make a nice presentation. I left out the whip cream on top.

My 15 yr old made this last night and we loved it. With five kids it was gone in a flash :) The only changes she made were minor..She used the canned pumpkin pie mix that has spices already, so she omitted the spices. She cooled it on counter and then put in freezer to cool quickly so we didn't have to wait the 3 hours...waited more like one (during a game of Pictionary). It was delicious, easy and pretty. Will make again for sure!

This has been a staple at Thanksgiving in our house for 3 years now. Make sure your ingredients are brought to room temperature and let the cheesecake cool for an hour in the oven after you turn it off. I tend to like using 3/4 cup of pumpkin pie filling instead of the pumpkin with spices. I do, however, add some pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and cinnamon to my pumpkin pie filing. I bake 55 minutes at the recommended temperature for the correct doneness.

It was good, but lacked a strong pumpkin flavor. I added more spices, 1/4 cup sour cream for the cream cheese part and made my own crust.

This recipe is delicious!! After reading some of the other reviews, I followed the suggestion of using 3 packages of cream cheese instead of two. The texture and flavor turned out perfectly!

I made my own graham cracker crust as well as homemade whipped cream, which only made the cheesecake taste even better.

I couldn't finish the entire cheesecake so ended up freezing part of it - still tasted delicious!

I like to use 1 1/2 cups of plain filing on bottom so the pumpkin isnt over powering. I also used a 1/2 cup of pumpkin filling instead of the puree and spices. I have to make two because the first is gone as soo as its cool enough to eat.

Delicious!!  I used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to avoid buying more spices and that worked fine.  Also added a tablespoon or 2 of sugar to the top layer and a little extra pumpkin.  The next morning I added the leftover pumpkin and some spice to pancake batter - got rave reviews on dessert and breakfast!

YUM! Best pumpkin cheesecake I've ever made, and so easy to make too! I love the fact that the flavor gets more "pumpkiny" the longer it sits in the fridge. I was pleasantly surprised each night I went for a slice that the pumpkin flavor had gotten more distinct.

This is absolutely the best pumpkin cheesecake recipe I have ever  made.  In fact, we have a good friend who doesn't like pumpkin and won't eat pumpkin pie but agreed to a taste of this and the next thing we know, he had a huge piece on his plate!!!

I didn't have any cloves on hand so just used a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. It came out great. Also, I didn't have graham crackers on hand so I made my own chocolate cracker crust from scratch and came out phenomenal! Made it for Christmas Day dinner and was a WINNER. At first I thought that the pumpkin didn't seem like it was enough or a lot but it was light and creamy. Very good will try it again in the future. I didn't do a water bath but it never cracked. =)

Fantastic! Superb! Their aren't enough positive adjectives to describe this lovely pumpkin cheesecake.  I used some of the modifications listed, 1/2 cup of sour cream after adding the eggs. 1 cup pumpkin pie filling. Since we used already spiced pumpkin pie filling no need for extra spice (added a dash of extra cinnamon anyways). A dash of extra vanilla extract.  We used about half of the mixture for the first later to create a more defined layer. Also used a 10 inch graham cracker crust (bigger cheesecake and it all fit!)  Took at hour to bake two of them side by side. Must do the water bath to avoid cracking.  Refrigeration (preferably overnight) is a must before serving.  Topped with frozen whipped topping. Everyone was impressed.  So good, thank you for sharing this is a winner!

I made this twice.   I made my own crust because I don't like presenting anything in store bought stuff.  I added my own spices that were a little heavier than the recipe called for.  It is a wonderful pie idea and tasted great.  My neighbors get all the left overs and they really enjoyed this pie.

Excellent recipe! We took it to a potluck, and the host kept raving about it, so we left most of the pie with them. We went home and tried it, and I still crave it now - after eating all of it. We'll just have to make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was the first cheesecake I ever made so I was nervous about getting it right.  But it was actually really easy.  The only thing I did different was to use pumpkin pie filling instead of all the separate ingredients.  I also set aside 1.5c of the cheesecake batter and spread the rest into the crust.  This made the layer of cheesecake about the same as the pumpkin layer.  This got rave reviews from my family, including my brother who doesn't like sweets.  I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I didn't try it myself but everyone seemed to like it and a few loved it.  I made a graham cracker crust myself since all the ones at the grocery store were broken.

Amazing! I have done this recipe quite a few times, and the only change I made was that I added a bit more vanilla, but only b'c I love vanilla not b'c it needed more, It's very easy, and everyone loves it! Even the picky ones I have that don't like pumpkin! Doesn't ever last long!!!

Delicious -- a huge hit at Thanksgiving, and a relatively simple recipe. One quibble: I found the recipe produced too much for one pie crust, but not enough for two. I had extra, so made a half-batch of "step 2" and then had enough for a second pie crust.

I had originally planned to nix all pumpkin desserts from my Thanksgiving menu, as hubby isn't a fan, but a friend insisted that her fiance loves this cheesecake despite disliking pumpkin. Hubby was very pleasantly surprised and told me it was delicious. I had fought the urge to add more pumpkin than the recipe called for, as it didn't seem like much, but it was perfect. A light flavor without being overwhelming. I'll make this again.   P.S. Dog owners: dogs LOVE canned pumpkin. If you opened a can for this recipe and don't know what to do with what you didn't use, consider giving them a treat. They'll love you for it. :)

This was my first cheesecake Ive made and I'm glad I made this recipe. I made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  My husband does not like cheesecake but he had it twice. It has a nice pumpkin taste but not overpowering because of the double layer. I will make it again soon. I loved it.. It did crack a little when it came out of the oven but it settled after it cooled down...

This cheesecake had everyone excited to try it. As soon as they heard it was on my thanksgiving pie list, I had so many people asking me to save them a slice. It turned out delicious, was super easy to make, and I cheated and used the pumpkin pie filling too, but I used a lot more than the recipe called for and I used a thicker layer of cream cheese filling on the bottom. Turned out great, was a big hit, added to my recipe box and will make again!

This is a definite keeper!! I would recommend doubling the cream cheese as suggested by other reviwers - to make it more cheese cake like. Also the pumpkin pie filling works just great in place of puree. Next time I will double the amount of cream cheese filling on the bottom layer and also add a layer of the cream cheese filling to the top to give it a triple layer effect. yummm thanks so much for the recipe!! AMAZING.

Pretty basic and delicious. I would've added more brown sugar and perhaps a bit more cream cheese as well. Tasty though!

AMAZING! This was actually very simple to make and turned out PERFECT.  I made this for the first Thanksgiving I prepared for my family.  It was a huge hit.  No one even touched the regular pumpkin pies I made.  I followed the recipe exactly, only prepared mine in a spring form pan and made the crust.  I baked it in a water bath as suggest on this site for baking cheesecakes.  Thank you so much for this great recipe....and making me look like a great cook for my family :)

This was fantastic! I ended up making it at 2 in the morning the night before Thanksgiving, and fell asleep once I put it in-It ended up being in there for about 55 minutes, and STILL turned out amazing! I put two big pans full of water in the oven while it baked though, so I'm sure that was a big saver.

This was fantastic! I ended up making it at 2 in the morning the night before Thanksgiving, and fell asleep once I put it in-It ended up being in there for about 55 minutes, and STILL turned out amazing! I put two big pans full of water in the oven while it baked though, so I'm sure that was a big saver.

Super yummy and easy to make!  Pumpkin taste is not too strong so for those who don't like pumpkin pie, they will probably still like this!

In a word... perfect! Didn't change a thing (except using 1/3 less fat cream cheese).  A big Thanksgiving Day hit!

This was amazing, but I did add 4 more oz of cream cheese to make it more cheese-cake-like. WHEN I make this again, I think I'll do an entire 3.  It was the perfect texture and had a great pumpkin pie flavor.  I also used a chocolate crust instead of graham, but that's my preference of mixing chocolate and pumpkin.  So good!

This was my first cheesecake ever, and it was remarkable.  I decided to take this to work and it was done in 10 minutes.  I used the canned pumpkin instead of the pumpkins itself. I used a water bath for one hour at 350 degrees and then cooled it in the oven with the door open for another hour. This recipe I will be making much more often.

Unbelievable!!!  I debated on which pumpkin cheesecake recipe to try, and this one will DEFINITELY be the one to keep.  My family loved it!  I ended up making a second one a few hours later to give to my sister because it was so good.  It is SO easy to make, and once it chills for a few hours, it is DELICIOUS!   Not too sweet, and just the right amount of pumpkin and spice, and cheesecake flavor.  WONDERFUL!

I made this the other night to see what the boys (hubby & son) thought of it.  Well as you can see by the rating it was a hit.  It all disappeared in less the 24 hours.  Also very easy to make, which makes me happy.  Thank-you for sharing.

Super easy and yummy!  I used a 15 ou can of pumpkin and an extra cream cheese based on other reviews but I ended up with quite a bit of extra, so plan to make some mini cheesecakes today.  I brought this to a "Friend's Thanksgiving" and everyone said it was great!

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe but doubled the spices and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as well (personal pref. to have it spicier). Also used cin. graham crackers to make crust. The only concern I have is using the 9" spring form pan ended up with thin layers. Next time (this week) will be a smaller spring form or doubling recipe as some have mentioned doing. The taste and texture cannot be beat, it's wonderful.

Delicious!  Great texture and great flavor.  It has a nice underlying spice but the pumpkin isn't overpowering.  I followed the recipe exactly (used reduced fat cream cheese) and it was SO quick and easy.

This recipe is so yummy! My 5 year old LOVES this dessert. She's normally not a big fan of pumpkin recipes. I follow the recipe as suggested. Every time I make it there's never left overs:) Would highly recommend.

This was an amazing recipe. I have been meaning to rate it earlier but I never got around to it.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner for dessert and it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe but I didn't share it... I want this to be my secret weapon every year!   Thanks for the recipe!

WHooops!  Almost popped it in the over and forgot to add the eggs.  I scooped it out and mixed the layers with the eggs.  Wasn't 'double layered' but WAS AMAZING!  Used an Oreo 6" premade shell  (still followed ingredient mesurments and it was the perfect amount of filling) and topped with carmel.  Used puree pumpkin and added 1/2 tbs McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the individual spices and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it and asked of the recipe.

This is my all-time favorite pumpkin cheesecake recipe! I have been making it for three years now and it never disappoints. It may just be my oven, but I've found I have to let it cook at least 45 minutes for the center to set properly.

This one got RAVE reviews from my mother-in-law! What's better than that?! I took other reviewer's suggestions. I used a premade 9-in graham cracker pie shell & the pumpkin pie filling. I kept the spices the same (as the filling already had spices). I put the pie shell & cream cheese layer in the freezer while I made the 2nd layer. This kept them separated perfectly. Also I found that 1 cup of the cream cheese was enough on the bottom & I had too much pumpkin mixture left over. Even my father-in-law who's not a pumpkin fan LOVED it!  * * * * * + Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so simple and it tastes great.  I have made it several times.  Plan on bringing extra copies of this recipe if you take this cheesecake to a party because you will be asked for it.

This cheesecake is very good.  I followed the first review under "most helpful"and used a springform pan, baked at 350 in a water bath (1 hr), then cracked the oven door open (turning the oven off) for an additional hour.  I made it the night before and moved it from the oven straight to the refrigerator.....it turned out perfect.  I made my own graham cracker crust, drizzled caramel over the top and served with whipped topping.  It was a hit!  I also used the same ingredient amounts as indicated by that same review.  Great for the holidays or a fall dessert!!

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner last year.  Everyone loved it and no one even touched the regular pumpkin pie.  One of the guest said she didn't normally like any kind of cheesecake except plain, but she loved this.  Definitely going to make it again this year!

This cheesecake is phenomenal. I made this at Thanksgiving, and it was such a hit that I also made it at Christmas. It was gone in about an hour. I think I'll have to make a couple of cheesecakes next year. If you like pumpkin and cheesecake (which really, who doesn't?) make this cheesecake.

I never made cheesecake before but it was easy and everyone loved it! I would recommend adding more of the cheesecake layer, maybe a 1/2 cup more to have a more even layering with the pumpkin. I added choc. chips to the cheesecake layer too! delicious!

I used this for a base recipe.  When I make pumpkin pie , or any other pie for that matter, I use a 10" pie plate.  Why go to all that work and not make a big pie?  What happens is I always have filling left but not enough to make a 9" pie.  What to do with the filling???  I poured my pumpkin pie filling into the crust and baked for about 6 mins till it was not runny any more and then poured the cheesecake part of this recipe on top.  It was amazing!  There were 3 pies at the party, a pumpkin, apple and my pumpkin cheese cake.  Mine was gone first, then a little of the pumpkin, no one touched the apple.  I have never liked pumpkin cheese cake before, just not my thing.  This was the best of both worlds and used up my extra filling!!

I made several changes, but I'm glad I did, because this cheesecake was so good I was told it was Cheesecake Factory worthy. First, added a 3rd package of cream cheese.  Increased sugar to 3/4 C. Folded in about 4 ounces of sour cream after adding the eggs.  Used a whole can of pumpkin. Doubled, if not more than doubled, the spices with the pumpkin. I was worried that with all the increases, it would not fit my crust, so I bought graham crackers just in case. Let me tell you, when you're standing over the trash can with the pre-made crust laying shattered amongst the rubbish because you were an idiot and tried knocking the crumbs out, and it's 8:00pm on Christmas eve, you are VERY glad you bought that box of graham crackers. I was also very glad when it was so much pie it almost over flowed my springform. So probably could have made two pies using a regular store crust. Used about two cups of the plain cheesecake for the bottom, the rest mixed with the pumpkin and the changes I noted, and cooked for about an hour. Like I said, "Cheesecake Factor worthy." Thanks for the recipe and thanks to all those whose changes I stole!

You can't go wrong with this cheesecake! Nearly foolproof and has a classic pumpkin pie flavor to it. Delicious! I made it exactly as is, baked 35 minutes, it turned out beautifully, not a crack in sight on the top either.

This was good!  I put in almost the whole small can of pumpkin, added pumpkin pie spice.  Followed other viewers, and added more of the cream cheese on the bottom.

I did this one for thanksgiving, and I wasnt able to find any pumpkin puree, so I boiled and pureed a sweet potato as a substitute, and added 1/4 cup of white sugar more.  It was a hit.  For my graham cracker crust, I blended walnuts w/the crackers...Yum.

not as rich and sweet as i was expecting.  for the topping i whipped heavy whipping cream with cinnamon in it and it think that was the sweetest part.  there was also WAY more of the pumpkin layer than would fit in the crust.

In short, change nothing, this is great... even for a beginner.  I've never made a cheesecake before and this receipe was very easy to follow.  Having a pumpkin pie loving family, this seemed like a great one to try.  Family reviews were great.  Everyone was impressed with the accomplishment of the double layer look - "professional looking."  As a novice cheesecake maker, I continued baking for a little while longer than suggested because I wasn't sure that it looked done when the suggested time had elapsed.  It still came out great.  Next time, because there will be a next time, I would like to try just a little more pumpkin; and I'll after reading some of the other reviews, I will try cooling the pie in the oven after the suggested baking time has elapsed (because I did have one small crack in the middle and I'm not sure if it was due to overbaking or not).  P.S.  I used fresh pumpkin, so this may be the reason why I feel like I would like to try to add more because I feel fresh pumpkin naturally has less taste than canned.  Again, though, it not necessary to change anything in this receipe.  Thank you, another holiday tradition started.

I have made this for the last 2 thanksgivings, and it is always a hit. It is definitely easy to make with great results! I was originally looking for a pumpkin pie/cheese cake layered pie, and came across this, this is more of a cheesecake with a pumpkin pie flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie and it was such a hit!  I increased the cream cheese to 3 8oz packages and the pumpkin to 8oz.  The cheesecake was rich and creamy and the pumpkin layer has a yummy pumpkin flavor to it that wasn't over powering (from a girl who is not a pumpkin pie fan).

Delicious! my second time making cheesecake and this recipe was SO easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used one package of 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and one package or regular.. in an attempt to make the recipe a little healther. Still tasted delicious and no one could tell! Will definitely be making this again!

To me, this recipe is pretty bland as written. However, after making some modifications, the end result was delicious. I doubled the amount of pumpkin puree that is called for in the recipe and added quite a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I just kept adding spices and tasting the batter until it resembled pumpkin pie filling. It was a hit with our family - even my extremely picky sister liked it!

This was pretty good.  I only gave it 4 stars, because I followed the recipe and baked it in a pre-made graham cracker crust, and the texture of the cheesecake was different from those made in a springform pan.  Also, I did not think that the bottom "plain" layer stood out - it might as well just have been blended with the pumpkin.  Also, this makes a lot of filling, I ended up overfilling my pie crust (because I only had one and I didn't want leftover filling), which left cracks on top.  I wasn't too worried about the cracks, I just added a dollop of Cool Whip on top and no one noticed (that being said, I did not cover the whole thing with Cool Whip because I think that would have been too much).  Still a good recipe, and may be great with a few alterations.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving, and I had all my family members asking for more.    As for the recipe itself, for the most part, I followed it very closely.  Except, I didn't have cloves so I excluded those.  Also, I doubled the amounts for cinammon and nutmeg.  Perfect!  THank you for this wonderful recipe!

I love love love Pumpkin Cheesecake!!! I did use this recipe for the filling, but used another recipe for the gingersnap crust and followed some tips provided by this site for cooking cheesecakes. I made a gingersnap crust with 1 1/2 cup ground gingersnap cookies, 1/3 cup melted butter, and 1/4 finely chopped Pecans--Mix well and press into 9 in pie shell. The only other thing I did was add more pumpkin pie seasoning ( its fine without adding more But it is my Personal tastes I like it spicy) I Have a BEAUTIFUL and YUMM-O Pumpkin Cheesecake in my fridge, thanks a ton!!!!!

Recipe is so easy and it came out amazing. 40 minutes was not enough for me though. For those looking for somewhere to shed calories, I used lite cream cheese and it still came out delicious. Also, make sure you blend it at a low speed.

This was an excellent recipe but I did add an extra 8 oz cream cheese as suggested and used pumpkin pie filling rather than puree. I would make this again for sure~

LOVED this! I love pumpkin, but for some reason, not pumpkin pie (too moist, I think.) This was the perfect solution - so creamy! Only thing I changed was make the bottom layer a bit deeper as some suggested. Also, it needed to cook about 10 to 12 min more for me. Great recipe!

I had to edit my review and let everyone know how I won a "Gold Medal" at my Parks & Recreation's Department's Annual Baking Contest with Stephanie's recipe. The only changes I made were using 1 and 1/2 cups of batter for the first layer (it evened out the layers equally, making for a prettier pie) and I also made my own home made crust. I had a tiny pitcher of caramel sauce and some whipped cream for the Judges to try along with it. This is a wonderful and easy recipe. It has such a nice mild pumpkin flavor. We had it for the first time last Thanksgiving and it will now be a part of our desserts every year. Thanks Stephanie for a wonderful recipe!

This came out fantastic...i prefer to make my own crust (1 cup crushed graham crackers, 1/2 cup toasted and then ground pecans, sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin pie seasoning and 1/4 cup melted butter). It layered beautifully(mine was not quite as dramatic as the pictures because I used homemade pumpkin puree and wasn't so orange, but tasted great.)  I cooked it a bit longer and used a water bath, didn't crack.  Topped with store bought caramel icecream topping. Perfect.

Delicious! I have made this with separate layers, and also mixed everything up. It was gone quickly both ways!

This cheesecake was AMAZING!! I don't think I will ever make plain ol' pumpkin pie again! It is very light and tasty!! The only changes I made were to use a little extra pumpkin and spices.  This was even a hit with my son who normally won't even look twice at a pumpkin pie!

Too easy & too yummy!  I too used canned pumpkin pie filling (3/4 cup) and omitted the spices, aside from the dusting of cinnamon I put on the whipped cream.  I also made a homemade graham cracker crust with cinnamon grahams...everyone at home and work loved it, one for the recipe box!

All 17 guests loved this!  I have to make it again for tomorrow by request for another family dinner!  I took some advice and used pie filling instead of the puree and spices but otherwise followed recipe to the letter.  Thanks for this one as it has already became tradition in our home.  Happy Thanksgiving Canada!

Excellent Cheesecake and quite easy to prepare.  I used a combination of a gingersnap crust and graham wafer, it was a good mixture.  I followed a few modifications as referred to in other reviews; 3 pkg of cream cheese, 1/2 sour cream after the eggs and I also added 1T of Kahlua to this bottom layer only.  I topped with some pecans and a caramel drizzle.  This was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I always bake my cheesecakes in a water bath, if you are worried about the water getting into your crust, I invert a tin pie plate in the water bath lifting my pan about 1", but I also use tin foil just to be sure.

I love this recipe and so did my family. I have made four pies within two days, by request of my step daughters.

If this recipe could get 10 stars it would.  If you like pumpkin pie you will love this, it is so creamy that I didn't even need to put the whipped cream on it.  I made it for my bridal shower in a 9x13 pan (doubled the recipe) and by the end of the shower I only had 6 one inch pieces left.  So yeah amazing is the word, this is our new pumpkin pie for thanksgiving!!!

I've made pumpkin cheesecake once before and this one was really delicious. I tried experimenting by adding a little rum extract but it overpowered the pumpkin taste. It still tasted good, and it looked nice with the two layers. I did what another user did and put the pan in the freezer after putting the first layer over the crust. If you add rum or rum extract, be very careful!

Very good recipe. It's a little different from the regular pumpkin pie. I used Libby's pie filling. I did add more pumpkin filling to the cream cheese mixture to suit my taste.

I hate pumpkin pie (the texture just grosses me out), so this was a wonderful alternative for a Thanksgiving dessert.  Only change -- I used a touch more pumpkin filling than the recipe called for.  Next time, I think I will just skip the Cool Whip -- it doesn't need it and Cool Whip is sort of creepy anyway.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was amazing!  I used 3 bricks of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream to get the real creamy cheesecake that I love. I also used a cup of pumpkin pie filling and then omitted the spices as they are already in the filling.  Delicious!!

Before starting comments on this recipe, I wanted to say one thing I liked the best about it is that I believe that this could be modified to do all kinds of two layer cheesecakes.  Basically, since you are using the same filling for the top and bottom layers, instead of adding pumpkin to the top layer batch, I plan on trying out different variations:  chocolate, lemon, mocha, the list is endless.  I don't see any reason why this couldn't become a wide variety of two layer cheese pies!
NOW, THE REVIEW:  After trying another 2 layer recipe from this site last year, I followed the high ratings and chose this one. 
It was very good and flavorful.  I did follow the suggestions and used pumpkin pie filling to save on spices.  The layers had a nicely defined separation-  there were two very clear layers.  The filling was creamy and smooth but not overly dense or dry as some cheesecakes can be.  Be sure, as with all cheesecakes, to take it out while the middle is still wiggly- it will set considerably after cooling and refrigerating. Cooking on this low heat and watching the time carefully so as to not overcook is KEY.  Be sure you have the BIG pie crust as it totally filled up my large pie pan -- to the rim!  If you use 8" pie pan, you will not be able to get it all in.

I can't really rate this because there wasn't any left for me at the end of the lunch hour!  I piped some cream on the top (combo of cream, maple syrup, cinnamon), and it seemed to complement the cheesecake.  I got rave reviews but I do wish there was SOMETHING left for me to try.  :)

This was the first time I have ever made cheesecake, and I must say it was easy and delicious.  I followed the reccomendations of one of the other gals, and used 3/4c of pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree and other spices.  I used 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2c + 2 tbsp of sugar.  It was very good.

Made it twice.  IT ROCKS.  I made it originally for my neighbors.  They don't like pumpkin pie, and they said this was the best, moist-est, yummiest pumpkin cheesecake they've ever had.  They raved about it so much that I ended up a little embarrassed and my husband was angry that I didn't make him any.  Thus, I have now made this twice.  Be sure to have milk on hand.. this is rich stuff.  :)  will make again.

This Pumpkin Cheesecake is absolutely fantastic! I made it for a dinner party and no one would believe me that I made it myself. Next time I make it, I'm going to put a cup and a half of pure cheesecake mix into the pie crust before I add the pumpkin and everything, to get more of a half-and-half split of pumpkin/regular cheesecake. I like it to be a bit more even, and last time it was mostly pumpkin with a hint of cheesecake.

This pumpkin cheesecake is wonderful! This was actually the first cheesecake ive ever made , but it was pretty easy and very tasty! I took some of the advice of others to make my pie. I actually added a half cup of libbys pumpkin pie mix out of the can and half a cup of pumpkin puree out of the can to my cheescake mixture. I decided to add the pumpkin puree so that it would add a little thickness , because with just the libbys mix its a little runnier. The libbys mix gives so much flavor tho it really is great to use.Then I added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Turned out great! loved it!

This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My husband actually asked where I bought it from!  I've made it several times and the last time I mixed it all together.  I think it had an even better taste, although you don't get the pretty presentation of the layers.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  This is replacing regular pumpkin pie at our Thanksgiving dinner from now on.  I took other people's advice and increased the cream cheese and pumpkin, but in the end it didn't all fit into the store-bought graham cracker crust, so it was a waste.  Next time I'll just follow the recipe as written.  FYI, I gave this recipe to my sister-in-law, and she said she used the reduced fat cream cheese and it worked fine.

I followed the recipe exactly, but increased the cheesecake layer to 1 and a quarter cup like others have suggested.  At first I didn't think there would be enough of the pumpkin layer, but after baking  it -- the distribution between layers was perfect. Very very good recipe and very easy. Just make sure cream cheese is at room temp so it doesn't get clumpy.

So good! Made this to serve with X-mas eve dinner. My mother and grandmother both loved it. The second half of the pie was devoured by my boyfriends family. This was one of the most simple pies to make, and the end result was great.

If this rating had more stars I would have given it.  This is by far one of the best pie/cake I have had.  My two favorite desserts combined into one! I took the others suggestions and doubled the cream cheese and put more of the pumpkin filling in first for a more dramatic difference.  I also used 1/2 cup of sour cream in this for extra creaminess. It was fantastic. I had many requests for the recipe so far and will continue making this...YUMM

I make this every year! The only difference I would suggest is making your own graham cracker crust. It's easy and makes a more "homemade" impression. I'll continue making this one for years to come.

My attempt at this recipe turned out delicious and was very easy to prepare. I used two short cuts- an already prepared Nilla wafer pie crust and pumpkin pie spice. In the future I would add more of the first cheesecake layer so it is more noticeable when sliced. I am definitely going to prepare this dessert again. Thank you!

This was great! I used a cup and a half for the bottom layer, and the layers turned out even. I also used pumpkin pie filling (with all the spices already in it) and just added a little cinnamon. This is a really good and easy recipe!

LOVED the taste, but it didn't set up completely in the 40 minutes of bake time.  I might try again and bake it a little longer.

Fabulous recipe!  We normally do the traditional pumpkin pie but wanted a change this year.  This double-layer pie gives you the best of both worlds -- pumpkin pie and cheesecake!  Simple to put together and the two layers gives a spectacular appearance on the plate.  We garnished each slice with real whipped cream rather than covering the whole pie, and drizzled with caramel ice cream topping as someone else suggested.  I also added a bit more pumpkin than called for and doubled the spices.  Great recipe... this will be a new Thanksgiving tradition!

Extremely simple and cheap to make, I added extra cloves to add some zip.  I don't think you need the caramel sauce, it's already very rich and doesn't need extra sweet stuff.

I love this recipe. I am pregnant. So I have been craving this type of cheesecake. Now I can make it myself without having to buy a slice at a time. Even my picky 3 yr old called it delicious(she has a large vocab).

Absolutely delicious!  I used fresh pumpkin puree, and it was tasty.  I have made it many times since the first time, and it is asked about/for and gets thumbs up every time.

This is very good - and very easy to make.  However, I'd only give it a 3 star until to totally cools and has been refrigerated for a day - the texture thickens up a lot and tastes much better.  Great for making in advance for turkey day:)  Thanks!

Yummy!  I used the graham cracker crust from "Chantal's New York Cheesecake" recipe on this site to make my own crust.  I used one package of 1/3 less fat and one package of fat free cream cheese, but it still set perfectly.  For a Halloween party, I saved an ounce of the cream cheese and made a cream cheese frosting to pipe into a spider web pattern on the top.  Then I decorated it with plastic spiders.  It looked great and tasted even better!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a hit for thanksgiving!  I will definatly make this again.  I did a couple of things different by combining some of the suggstions that were given.  I used 2 1/2 pkg of the cream cheese and added about 1/2c up of light sour cream after I added my eggs.  I did add a bit more spice, but not to much more because those sort of spices flavour up after they have been baked.  I ended up cooking it for and 1hr and 10 min at 325.  When serving I cheated and bought a carmel sundae topping and added it to the top of the pie with a dallop of whip cream.  YUMMY!  Thank you so much, definatly will be making this again!

FANTASTIC!!! This combines my 2 most favorite desserts! This is now my most requested dessert. I have to bring it to every function at during the holidays. During the last Christmas season I even had to make it just for my husband and son about 5 times. I used all organic ingredients and it really enhanced the flavor!

Very good!  My first attempt at making a cheesecake and it was VERY easy...  Next time I will make the cheesecake layer a little thicker.  It was a little more "pumpkin pie" tasting than I had hoped, didn't get to tase the cheesecake as much as I would have liked.

This cake was heavenly. I added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe calls for as well as 1/2 cup of cour cream.  In addition because the pumpkin seemed to dilute the batter a bit I added about 2 tbs of flour since I like my cheesecake to be smooth and thick.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so so so good!  My husband loves Pumpkin pie but I'm not very fond of the traditional kind.  This pie makes us both happy.  I follow the directions exactly and it turns out great.  The pie gets spicier the second day so I make ahead of time for a more blended taste.  Best recipe tried!

Made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and it was unbelievable.  I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and followed other reviewers comments in adding a little more pumpkin pie filling and spices.  My boyfriend loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This one's a definite hit. Everytime I've made it, I have people ask me for the recipe. Follow the instructions exactly and its just about foolproof. It tastes like you've done a lot of work when in fact its rather easy to put together. I even served it once to someone who disliked pumpkin and he thought it was fantastic. This one's a holiday tradition now in our house.

I took the advice of SOUTHERNBELLE and increased the cream cheese, pumpkin, spices and added the sour cream. I made a double recipe graham cracker crust and baked it in a springform pan. Took a little longer to bake, but was beautiful. I piped whipped topping on it and sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice on top. It was the favorite at Thanksgiving, No leftovers!!!

Absolutely delicious.  My family went crazy over it, even the picky eaters.  I followed some of the advice from other reviews, baking it in a spring form pan.  I added a honey ginger whipped cream recipe from this site and it worked wonderfully.

It's easy to see why this recipe has five stars - tastes great and is a much better dish than just plain old pumpkin pie!  I would recommend whipping the cream cheese for 6-8 minutes - makes the cheesecake lighter.  Thanks!

I have made this for the last couple years.  I LOVE it!  I make my own graham cracker crust instead of the store bought.  It tastes better.  I also use the canned pumpkin 3/4 cup.  It gives it more flavor.  35 min and it turns out great.  Don't overcook it.

This is wonderfull. I followed other reviewers sug, and used 3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree.  Except that I followed rec to a T, baked for 35 min, worked out great. If you are not sure about your baking skills you can make Double Layer Pumpkin Pie from this site which taste to me the same but with no baking trubbles :)

Followed ideas from Southernbelle0908...
springform pan, 15oz can of pumpkin (love pumpkin)...1 & 1/2 the rest of your recipe and gave it a water bath. I've never made a single cheesecake until this recipe..and I've made it twice in the 3 weeks of finding it. FANTASTIQUE!!!

made for Thanksgiving & had so many compliments and requests for this recipe (& I even used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, a reduced-fat crust, and Splenda instead of sugar).  will definitely make again!

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was my first attempt at cheesecake and it turned out perfectly and looked beautiful. I don't even own a spring form pan (is that what it's called?) and it didn't even matter..it came out so perfectly. I love this recipe because I'm a brand newbie to baking and it made me look and feel like a PRO! thank you sooo much for sharing such a great recipe!!!!!!! I wish I could give it more than five stars!!!

I don't even own a spring form pan (is that what it's called?) and it didn't even matter..it came out so perfectly. I love this recipe because I'm a brand newbie to baking and it made me look and feel like a PRO! thank you sooo much for sharing such a great recipe!!!!!!! I wish I could give it more than five stars!!!

This recipe was way too easy. My family loved it! I too used the small can of pumpkin instead of just 1/2 cup, and it was perfect. This will be in the holiday box of recipes made every year.

Very yummy!  I took it to my holiday dinner and work and one or even two wasn't enough to go around--first dessert on the table to vanish.  I loved it myself and it was definately easy to make!

I followed the advice of SOUTHERNBELLE0908 it turned out great..  I asked my co-workers what their opinion of it was...They ask if they could have another to taste test..LOL  I used a quaility carmel bought at a store due to time constraints.

This pie was fantastic.  For those that like pumpkin but maybe don't LOVE it, this is your recipe.  Just a hint of pumpkin to make it appropriate for the holidays.  Everyone devoured it - I should have made two.  Thanks Stephanie!

This is similar to pumpkin pie only with a lot more calories!  You can't really taste the cheesecake much and it's a bit lumpy on the bottom layer.  I gave it a three star only because I've had much better.  Sorry :(

Great!! Super Easy, the only thing I would change is making it the night before your occasion, it tasted even more heavenly the next day!! I substituted Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the individual spices. This cheesecake received rave reviews (even guests who NEVER eat dessert had a piece), next time I'll make two. I will be making this one again before Christmas!

This is the ultimate pie for any Thanksgiving dinner!! I made it last year (and what month are we in? Sept) and I am already looking forward to making it this year for my family and soon to be inlaws. Wouldn't change a thing about the prep for this recipe, I would also recommend "Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie" by Anita L. Both make for a lovely selection at the desert table. Enjoy, I know I will :)

I made this for Thanksgiving it was the hit of the party. Everyone was surprised that it was a home made cheescake. I did alter the recipe a little. My family doesn't like cloves or cinnamon that  much so I omitted the cloves all together and put only a pinch of cinnamon and increased the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. Eveyone loved it because there was just a light pumkin flavor. Super easy to make.Thanks Stephanie!

Very good! I used a 9" prepared graham cracker crust, and the filling was just right for it. I did follow some recommendations and used 1 1/2 cups of "plain" cheesecake filling in the bottom instead of just 1 cup.

This is a great recipe. I use 2.5 pack of cream cheese and 2 cups of pumpkin puree. Since I was making a single layer cake, I just mix everything together. The result is a light and delicious cheesecake, great for summer!

Very good.  I put pie plate on cookie sheet filled with a little water to prevent cracking.  I drizzled melted chocolate over top-was a big hit.  I will keep this recipe in my permanant collection!

Ridiculously easy... and UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS!  I served 2 desserts at Christmas dinner tonight - this cheesecake and a gorgeous, bakery-bought chocolate cake...  I am proud to say that while the chocolate cake had just a wedge taken out, I'm having to scrape the empty cheesecake pan just to get a taste.  (Also made it with "Graham Cracker Crust III which was also fantastic).

This recipe is the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever had. I did use 3/4c sugar, 1t vanilla, and next time will use more pumpkin. But it was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner. I made two desserts from AllRecipes, and they were the only ones that were eaten. The other 3 storebought desserts remained untouched. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

For those who are looking for an alternative topping to whipped cream, try using caramel syrup.  You can get it at the grocery store by the ice cream toppings.  Smuckers has the best.  It adds the perfect taste and texture.

Took it to work for the guys and their comments were "I'm not into cheesecake, but that was great!"  The ones that were into cheesecake loved it!!!  As for me, well it was exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for sharing!

I got rave reviews with this recipe this Christmas. Even my husband, who didn't think he liked cheesecake, loved it.

LOVED IT!! I added honey to the cream cheese in the first layer.  I also used light cream cheese which turned out great.  Came out perfect the first time.  Well written instructions very clear and easy.

All I can say is, this pie ROCKS!! It's very easy, all you do is mix the ingredients, pour, and bake! And the taste is great! When you cut it, it looks very cool with the thin layer of cheesecake on the bottom. I was asked to make it again! :)

This didn't come out quite as good as I had hoped.  The taste was good, but I think that the pre-made crust detracts from the overall flavour.  Also, it needed to cook for a good 20-25 minutes longer than indicated.  Next time I will make a quick graham cracker crust and, for the first layer, I will put more unseasoned batter in before i mix in the pumpkin.  My first layer was pretty undefined (there just wasn't enough of it.)  I have to say it was very creamy and the pumpkin layer was very well seasoned!

Ok, this is about the best thing that has ever come out of my kitchen.  My son LOVES it, I LOVE it, it is fantastic.  I did bake it for 40 minutes and it still probably could have used another 5 minutes but other than that, it turned out perfect.  I can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving.

I used low fat cream cheese, sugar substitute, one teaspoon lemon rind (instead of vanilla), canned pumpkin, and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spices (instead of the three spices listed).  I skipped the whipped topping.  The result was a really delicious low fat, sugar free, alcohol free pie.

Changes as follows:nI made my crust using 1 1/2c graham crackers with 6 T melted butter. Used 3 8oz cream cheese, 3/4c sugar, 3 eggs, 1/2c sour cream, 8oz pumpkin puree, 1 t. vanilla. Reserved an additional 1 c. plain cheesecake to swirl on top. Baked at 350 for 1 hr 5 minutes using a waterbath. Allowed to cool in closed oven for 6 hrs. Came out PERFECT! This blows Cheesecake Factory out of the park! Also made a homemade caramel sauce to drizzle

Fantastic cheesecake. Light, creamy and delicious, and very easy to make. I took the advice of others and increased the amount of mixture by 1/2 cup to the bottom layer. Definitely a keeper. Thank you.

I read many of the other reviews which on many other recipes is very helpful but with this recipe it seemed like the changes people made pretty much should’ve been a brand new recipe so I decided to stick to the recipe and it was a major hit! Will definitely make again!

Made exactly per recipe and came out delicious. I used the recipe for "Graham Cracker Crust I" for the pie crust  and the cinnamon went great with the pumpkin flavor.

I've made this a few times over the years and it is wonderful!! My husband and sons favorite! Each time I make it people compliment and ask for the recipe. It is one that has been in my recipe book and is my go-to pumpkin pie (since it's better than a basic pumpkin pie ) recipe .

Thought August was a little early to make a pumpkin cheesecake but then heard a Starbucks commercial for Pumpkin Spice Latte and decided that pumpkin cheesecake would totally be legit then. Lol! Tripled the recipe for an event I signed up to bring desert to and it was a big hit! Followed the recipe to a "T". Everyone loves it!

I don't even like pumpkin, but this is really good. I used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree. Great dessert for a holiday meal.

This recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I loved the ease with using the pre made crust. The batter is simple and sets up great with no cracking.

I was so confused as to what went wrong when I made it. It wasn't what I was expecting, it was bland. I followed the recipe exactly :(. It was a great idea but I don't know what everyone else did to make it tastier than mine.

Made it just as the recipe called for but I used a 10" crust and added a lot more pumpkin than the recipe suggested. Covered the whole pie in fresh whipped cream and it was the biggest hit of Thanksgiving dinner. Such a nice change from plain old pumpkin pie. I'll be making it again next year.

This cheesecake is ridiculously easy to make, and SOOOO good.  It really has a nice cheesecake flavor and a great texture.  I took other's suggestions and bought the pumpkin pie filling, as well as increasing the amount of bottom filling just a bit to even out the layers more.  It doesn't get much easier than this for a fantastic dessert, with such a high quality of flavor.

Mmmmmmm! I made a graham cracker crust and used a springform pan and it both beautiful and delicious. Didn't bother with a water bath or anything, just baked for 45 minutes and it had no cracks. A half cup of pumpkin seemed way too little so I used 1 cup and I liked that ratio. I also used 1 tsp cinnamon and since I didn't have nutmeg I added a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice. Oh this will be made again, that's a guarantee!

Because I live in a different country, it is difficult for me to find the necessary ingredients. So i used what I had available. Instead of Vanilla extract (which i couldnt find) I used some vanilla sugar. I dont have access to sugar pumpkins so i used a different pumpkin. we dont have graham crackers but we do have a similar tasting biscuit. the spices were a challenge so i had to grind my own cloves (i think i used a bit too much), no  nutmeg i found in my area. I am not a sweet eater. But I LOVE to bake! i really enjoyed this recipe even though it was a little difficult to direct for me. I have made cheesecake before. However,  Including my indulgence of clove, it was actually quite tasty. This a good foundational recipe for those who cant find the proper ingredients.

This is definitely the best thing I've ever baked, and I just followed the recipe word-for-word. This is a great, relatively light cheesecake with lots of flavor. The vanilla extract and cinnamon just make it sumptuous. I made this in my dorm on Sunday, and it's Wednesday and there's only one tiny slice left because no one can stop eating it! I plan to make it again for Thanksgiving because cheesecake is my brother's absolute FAVORITE thing, except for pumpkin pie...so perfect!

Made this for my mom's birthday and we all loved it!  The only thing I did different was to increase ingredients slightly for a 10" pie crust. Put in the fridge over night and it was perfect!  Thanks for recipe.

I don't like pumpkin pie at all, so I was very hesitant to try this recipe. BUT...I'm extremely glad I did. My sister-in-law always has a large (20-26 people) family Thanksgiving and most everyone brings something. Since everyone who comes loves pumpkin pie, I thought I'd give this "kicked up a notch" recipe, a try. It was easy to make, and since it does require chilling, I was able to make another dish. When dinner was over, I went to collect my remaining dishes only to find the Cheesecake Pumpkin pie plate was empty! Off all the desserts that were brought, it was the only one which had NO left overs! Thanks Stephanie, I think! I would have liked a few bites to take home with me!

I had some pumpkin purée left over from another recipe so it was a perfect time to try this recipe. It was easy to assemble and fit perfectly in the store bought crust.  This was my first time making cheesecake... Next time I would let the ingredients come closer to room temp before mixing, because I had a few small lumps. But my husband went back for seconds so it must have been just fine! Layers aren't even but it still looks nice and I'm not worried about changing it.

Nice to find a cheesecake that doesn't require a springform pan!
I increased the amount everything by a little bit because I had a 10 inch pie crust and I wanted it to be quite full.  It came out well.  The texture of my filling was slightly grainy but had a great taste.  Make sure to soften the cream cheese completely so it mixes up well.  
The top cracked a bit, but when it was cool it looked pretty nice.  The bottom layer is pretty short, I'd like to get the ratio more to half and half for a nice visual.

I made this tonight and it didn't seem sweet enough so I added a full teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 tbls. more sugar, and twice the vanilla. It made it much better for our taste. It creams so well, and the flavor is very Fall. I was asked to make it for Thanksgiving - so it's a Hit.

Fabulous!!! We rave with every single bite!  I normally don't like to rate recipes after altering them, but I have to on this one because I trust either way it comes out amazing!  I took the advice of many others and because I wanted a thicker plain layer, I added an extra 8oz of cream cheese, increased sugar to 3/4 cup, increased vanilla to 1 tsp, and added 1/4 cup sour cream. My daughter commented that she doesn't know why we would ever go to a cheesecake restaurant when we can get the best cheesecake at home! Winner! Thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend and I had a slice of pumpkin pie cheesecake at a restaurant a few days before I tried to make this. I liked it so much, got on here, and I found this recipe. This recipe is great and I make it exactly as written! Its almost as good as the one we had at the restaurant! Yum yum yum!

I made this cheesecake for my husband. He loves cheesecake but I hate it. It looked so delicious after I made it  that I had to taste it.  With the pumpkin mixed with it I must say that it was absolutely delicious. My husband and I was fighting over who would get the last piece. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way I didn't change a thing.

This was so delicious! I made it for Boy's Day, and everyone in my family loved it. I once used a prepared graham crust for a key lime pie and it tasted terrible, so now I always make my own. Here is a recipe for a perfect graham cracker pie crust: a little bit less then 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, 1 1/2 cup crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Preheat oven to 375 degrees, melt butter, and crush graham crackers by putting about 12 crackers into a plastic bag, sealing it, and rolling a rolling pin over the crackers. Combine in a bowl or food processor, then press into a 9 or 10 inch pan. Make sure it is evenly spread, with no gaps or holes. Bake for 8-10 min., or until the edges become slightly brown.  Let cool before filling.  I made my pie in the morning and ate it that night. It was delicious, but the next morning it was even better!

I've made this a few times at the request of friends and family. It's excellent. I like to use gingersnaps for the crust instead of graham crackers or add pie spice to the graham cracker crust mixture.

This cheesecake was really easy to make. Everyone in my family liked it. .orgThe pumpkin filling was so rich but yummy at the same time. The cheesecake part was ok. I thought the cheesecake was a desirable dish but I didn't care for the cheesecake part. I would've added a little bit more spices to the pumpkin. This cheesecake is better than store bought though.

GREAT RECIPE! I used 3 packs of cream cheese, added a half cup sour cream after the eggs, and increased the pumpkin to 8oz just like another persons who left a review before me. Turned out awesome! I also wrapped my pan in foil and baked in bath of water at 350 for an hour until the edges started to separate from the sides of pan, and jiggled like jelly to light touch. Kept in oven off for another hour then moved to fridge until next day. I added a scoop of fresh whipped cream. YUM!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone absolutely loved it! I found it slightly thick like a New York cheesecake but also pumpkiny like pumpkin pie. Great for anyone who loves good cheesecake and pumpkin pie too! I drained the pumpkin puree as advised in the reviews. I put the pumpkin pieces on paper towel over a colander which worked perfectly. A lot of the pumpkin juice was drained out and reduced the liquid in the batter. Draining the puree is vital. I'll be making this next Thanksgiving for the cheesecake lovers in my family!

I have made this countless times over this holiday season alone.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all.  Everyone who tastes it says it's delicious. I have given friends and family this cheesecake, and they all have loved it. Thanks so much for your recipe.  It's a keeper in my book of recipes.

Super easy! I found that one cup of plain cheese cake on the crust bottom was not enough to have a balanced layered look. I think at least 1.5 of plain cheese cake is needed if you are looking for the half/half look. Taste is creamy and smooth, not dense. Still prefer just a plain pumpkin pie but can't fault this cake for what it is, just a cake that tastes nice, looks nice and is easy!

Really good!! I made it twice. First I didn't have much cheesecake part but the pumpkin part is actually cheesecake too. I made it on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I don't know what -terry is talking about that it was horrible. Must have made the recipe wrong.

Well-received but exhausting!  I did take quite a few of the other reviewer's recommendations and came up with the recipe that worked the best for me and was to my and my families taste.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese, 8 oz. of pumpkin puree, 1.5 cups of shortbread cookie crumbs (for the crust) and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  When making it, I folded in the sour cream right after adding the eggs to the batter.  To bake, I placed it in a water bath for 1 hour and then propped the oven door open and left it inside for 1 hour more.  Cover it with a caramel glaze and you are in business!  It does take a lot of time- but people do seem to enjoy it.  :)

This wasn't as dense as a Cheesecake Factory dessert, but after Thanksgiving dinner, do you really want a super-heavy dessert? Garnished with whipped cream or sour cream sauce (sour cream, vanilla and sugar.) Followed the recipe. Nice results. I'll make it again.

I changed this up to follow my low carb diet by adding stevia instead of sugar, actual pureed pumpkin, and made the crust out of almond flour.  It turned out fantastic.

This cheesecake was a winner at my Halloween party this year. Everyone love it and kept asking about the recipe. Its very light and delicious and not too sweet. I made the puree from a pumpkin by myself instead of the canned one in the recipe.

This was a fun and delicious alternative to pumpkin pie. I really liked the two layer aspect of it. I would not recommend using a store bought graham pie crust though - they are not usually good quality and will totally take away from the finished result. I needed a gluten free crust anyway, so chose to go with a home made almond crust which is basically ground whole almonds and butter. It was a fabulous complement to this wonderful cheesecake. Just a dollop of unsweetened real whipped cream is needed on top to keep it from being too rich overall. A tip for avoiding a cracked top on your cheesecake- use room temp cheese and eggs, and don't over beat while mixing. Also, when the cake is done, turn the oven off and leave the cake in with the door ajar, until the oven cools. You can also run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan. Then, refrigerate. Cheesecake is also best best made the day before serving.

I have been making this cheesecake for thanksgiving for the last 4 years everyone loves it. I do make two minor changes, i use a gingersnap crust instead of the gram cracker and i use real whipped cream with a pinch of cinnamon instead of frozen topping.

Amazing recipe! Its the perfect blend of cheesecake and pumpkin; without any overwhelming each other. I make it every year for Thanksgiving and always get asked to make extra for Christmas.  Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature so it blends well. Also, make it a day in advance so it can set well.

wow! just made this recipe and was fantastic.  Followed southernbelle 0908 tips and turned out delicious.  I also was able to divide it into pies.  Only down side was that there were a few minor cracks....Going to try it again and see if I can prevent it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this, couldnt wait for it to be fully cooled and it was still deliscious! I added 1/4 cup extra pumpkin puree, about a tsp of vinilla and used two different types of gramcrackers for the crust. Everyone raved about it! Will make this again!

This was so easy to make and we absolutely LOVED it!  My mom is NOT open to new things and she said she doesn't know that she'll ever make regular pumpkin pie again.  Now THAT'S somethin!  And my dad immediately asked where we got this amazing pie.  People were pulling pieces of it out of the fridge and walking out the door with them with no plate...  That's how you know it's good...

I have made this multiple times and every time I do everyone loves it! I use 1/3 the fat cream cheese, Splenda and fat free cool whip and no one can tell the difference! Other than that I follow the recipe and it is perfect! Light, refreshing, and full of wonderful flavor!!

I don't care for cream cheese, but this is AMAZING. The bottom layer of the cake tastes like pure vanilla, with the texture of cream cheese. Could have ate the whole cake myself. Will make again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out good but not quite as I expected. The crust burned slightly probably bc I had to bake it much longer since I made it thicker by upping the recipe by half - put in 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 3 eggs, used 3/4 cup pumpkin puree, etc. Otherwise it would have been a thin cheesecake. It looks pretty but I think I'll stick to the regular non-layered pumpkin cheesecakes.

I have never made cheesecake before so I was a little nervous about trying this with my in laws coming over. I followed the recipe and it turned out great! Everyone loved it and I decided to make it again a few weeks later. The second time I used pumpkin pie filling with the spices already mixed in and it was just as good and a lot easier! I LOVE this cheesecake and will be making it in place of pumpkin pie on thanksgiving for years to come!

It was pretty good. I made it for my Thanksgiving-birthday party. I doubled and made 2 cakes. I should have triple for 2 cheesecakes because they came out very thin.

This recipe is awesome!!! I made this for a potluck at work at it turned out wonderful! Everyone loved it and wanted me to make it again. I brought a couple pieces home for my husband to try and as soon as he bit it, he was like "AWWWW SOO GOOD". My picky son liked it to.  I looked at all the reviews and decided to make it into bars with the 8x13 pan and wax paper on bottom as Jodi stated.  I used the same recipe above and doubled it to fit pan, but for the spices, I used the spices and amounts listed (did not double those), then added 1 heaping teaspoonful of pumpkin pie spice.  I did double the vanilla extract too to 1 tsp! I used Mrs Vela Ela Ela's graham cracker crumb recipe without nuts instead of store bought.  I cooked mine for 60 minutes on the dot, left the oven door open for 20 min (it was almost midnight, so tired), then left in the refrigerator till the next morning. I will always make this recipe forever!  Thanks!

Delicious and simple to make. I made mi own crust with Nilla cookies and butter and lowered the temp. to 300 so the crust wouldn't burn while the cheesecake baked. i also made it all pumpkin and the taste is just delicious.

Cream cheese flavor was a bit overpowering. I added two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and it was a bit blah. Not impressed, definitely better recipes for this type of dessert.

Thanks for a really great recipe! I brought this to a pie party (exactly what it sounds like) and it was gone in 10 minutes, even though there were 15 other delicious home made pies there that the guests could eat. I followed Southernbelle's suggestion and topped the cheesecake with a homemade caramel sauce. Definitely a hit.

A tip for getting the cream cheese to room temperature for impatient people like me: place the tin-foil cheese cake packets in a bowl of hot tap water for about 5 minutes or until soft. Dump the water and dry the bowl with a dish cloth and you can use it to mix the batter without another wash. To further improve the texture, I whipped the cream cheese with a fork to insure that even the middle of the block was warm and soft before adding the other ingredients.

I can't wait to bring this to Thanksgiving! Mom's pumpkin pie has some competition this year.

this recipe is DE-LI-CIOUS!  I used some tips from Southernbelle908-I used the ingredients listed in the original list but cooked in a water bath for 1hr instead, then propped open the oven and let the cheese cake cool for about 2hrs before removing it to prevent cracking.
I also modified the whip cream by making my own - 1/2 pint heavy cream (light will not work), 1 1/2TBS sugar, 1tsp vanilla.
Took this to a meeting and everyone LOVED IT! Adding this one to the box!

OMG!  Pumpkin pie WAS my favorite.  This is even better, if that's possible!  Love it; didn't change a thing except I made my own crust - next time I will not bake the crust by itself and then again with the cheesecake.  I'm thinking this will replace the traditional pie at Thanksgiving!

This cheesecake was the best pumpkin cheesecake ever.  Not to sweet or heavy. I followed the receipe (for the most part). I did not use the pumpkin pie filling(store was out)the receipe was very simple to follow and make. I also used Light Cream Cheese instead of regular and instead of using the graham cracker crust, i purchased Keebler's shortbread prepared crust.  It was so good, my family finished most of the pie in one night.

My mother loves pumpkin flavored desserts and this is, by far, her favorite. She always asks me to make it whenever I can. I always use fresh pumpkin puree made from scratch. I use a japanese squash called kabocha that is very similar to a pumpkin and it has a very sweet, fiberous flesh. You can usually find it in asian supermarkets during the fall season. I cut it into quarters, bake at 400 degrees in a water bath until the flesh becomes tender and you can stick a knife into it (about an hour or so). Then I scoop out the flesh and puree it with a hand mixer. It's more work but so very worth it!

Really good, just a little denser than a typical cheesecake.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and it was delicious.  Would definitely make again!

i just made this recipe and it was amazing! i took the advice from another review and added a touch more sugar and more vanilla and a bit of cinnamon and it turned out great! also i used a can of pumpkin pie filling instead of the pumpkin puree since i had that on hand and just skipped adding the spices since they are already in the pie filling.  My sister said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had!

I made this exactly as the recipe is written.  The filling is absolutely delicious and it came out great.  I had to give this only four stars because of the crust.  I wish it stated a homemade recipe for the crust. There must be one on this website, however I used a store bought one and it turned out to be a bit thin and hard and tasted a bit overdone.

I made this using 3/4c pumpkin, 1/2c sour cream, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and used splenda instead of sugar. I baked on a cookie sheet with water at 350 for 45 mins. I was hoping I'd love it, but it was really just okay. It wasn't creamy at all and was very strong tasting of cream cheese, which makes perfect sense since there is 16oz of it in the recipe. I'm not sure what could be done to this to make it better.

I followed the suggestions of SOUTHERNBELLE0908. This was incredible. Absolutely the best pumpkin cheesecake I've ever eaten. The only thing I might do differently next time is add a tablespoon of additional sugar or maybe a pinch of salt to balance out the addition of the sour cream. It was just a touch sour. I used a crushed gingersnap crust instead of graham cracker (which I highly recommend) and 3/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice + 1/8 tsp ground cloves.

I liked this a lot- but it tasted more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake. I think next time I would do a larger percentage of plain cheesecake with less of the pumpkin flavored layer. It was still absolutely delicious but I was just disappointed in how similar it was to a regular pumpkin pie. Also, keep in mind that I like a dryer, New York style cheesecake so this light, fluffy version isn't quite what I was hoping for.

I followed recipe to the T, but there wasn't enough pumpkin flavor for me. Maybe add pumpkin spice and cinnamon or maybe even more pumpkin? I probably wouldn't bother with this recipe again it's just not worth it. Also,the crust is soft and soggy the next day which is kind of gross!!

I really liked this recipe. I read a lot of the reviews first and I ended up going with the pumpkin pie filling. I consider myself a beginner when it comes to cooking/baking, and this was not a hard recipe to follow. My kids loved it.

Oh. My. God. This stuff is amazing! I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (since I didn't have the separate ingredients on hand) and I used brown sugar instead of white. Amazing. I don't forsee any more pumpkin pie out of my kitchen!

By the way, this is GLORIOUS when paired with a cup of hazelnut coffee :)

Very pretty layers and a great way to incorporate pumpkin into the cheesecake without being too "pumpkin-y". Thank you for a great recipe! Edit: highly recommend to double the "filling". As is the entire cheesecake comes up to about an inch in height. We prefer a thicker cheesecake.

This was amazing! Everything I expected and more. I made my own pumpkin puree and base which added to the recipes charm. Normally I'm not a fan of cheesecake but this has been entered in to my recipe book meaning it will be made again. Very important to serve with cream as it really topped it off. Simply amazing!

Used probably half of the mixture in the bottom layer before topping with pumpkin layer. (Also - did use puree pumpkin with pumpkin pie seasoning instead of individual spices.) Made with pie crust instead of graham crust. Good but not spectacular.

I made this for my mom's birthday. Made with a graham cracker crust. I was nervous as I tried the creamcheese batter before putting it in the oven and to be honest I was underwhelmed. I bought a back-up pecan pie, just in case. Well I was pleasantly surprised to see everyone ranting and raving about the cheesecake (even my step father who doesn't like sweets). The store bought pie went virtually untouched. My mom called a few days later to say they were fighting over the last few pieces! Will make this again!   :)

This cheesecake was really good but I would of liked a more pronounced pumpkin taste. So the next time I make it I think I will add an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin. As I was making it I looked at the recipe and saw it only called for 1/2 cup pumpkin, and I had to double check it b/c that didn't seem right to me. But that is my only complaint. I brought it to work for a Thanksgiving dessert and my co-workers love it! Thank you!

This was delicious, but I gave it 4 stars because I found a way to make it that we like even better than the original recipe. Instead of putting half cheese cake on the bottom and half pumpkin pie mix on the top....if you just mix it all together and make it the same it's SOOO YUMMY! We really do like it better that way, but hardly. Try it once and see how you like it!

Easy and delicious! Beautiful presentation. I think I added a bit more of the spice than the recipe calls for, but I supposed it's a matter of preference. I used a store-bought crust, but I may try it in my springform pan next time. We will definitely make this again!

I just made this recipe last night and serious...DELICIOUS!! I didn't put a layer of whipped topping on once it was finished becuase I personally like lots and lots of it so I set the container aside for people to add as much as they wanted. Also, instead of the three different spices, I used 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Plus I baked it in a spring-form pan. It turned out perfect and tasted just the same! Thanks for the recipe! :)

I really liked this recipe, but I did modify it just a bit:  Increased the pumpkin to 8oz, used 1 tsp vanilla and increased the cinnamon, clove and nutmeg (just kept adding until it tasted right to me).  I think that next time I'll also increase the sugar a bit, just to cut the tangyness of the cream cheese layer a little more.  OH--also I used 1/2 cup egg beaters instead of eggs and it turned out just fine.  Very good cheesecake!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Just made this recipe with a few changes.
I made it in a 9 inch springform pan w/ my own graham cracker crust on the bottom.
Read some reviews and based off of those, used 3 8ounce packs of cream cheese, 1/2c sour cream and used pumpkin pie filling w/ spices already added (1cup).
I added in the cinnamon. Baked on 350, foil wrapped bottom set in a baking sheet w/ water.
Baked for about 55mins. A little too long so the top cracked slightly, but I don't really care about that.
Made homemade whipped cream and YUM! Tasted delicious!

My son and daughter-in-law kept asking me if I bought this dessert... They took one that I made to a party and everyone was raving how good and nice it looked, so this lead them to believe I had to have bought it!  Serve with whipped topping and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

Brought this to two different dinners, and I got loads of praise at each one! I've already been asked to make this several more times, and my family's friends have been asking for the recipe! Definitely will make this again

I did exactly as southernbelle said, water bath, 350, extra filling and I got a completely cracked cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly as it was and it came out beautifully. Thanks Stephanie for giving me a PERFECT recipe :)

I added more cream cheese and pumpkin as others suggested.  I also added more sugar, at what I thought was proportionate to the rest.  It really wasn't sweet at all.  Was kind of blah.  For all the time that went into it, very disappointing.  But, this could have been cook's error.  It certainly looks beautiful.

These were awesome.  I made them in cupcake form and used pumpkin pie filler because I was lazy.  I also topped with sour cream topping to give it that tang.

WOW is all I have to say!! I made this over the weekend and my family was threatening to eat it before it cooled. It was even better the next day after being in the fridge overnight. Will def make again, I did however forget to add the egg on the bottom layer of the cheesecake but it came out wonderful anyway.

I and my family LOVED this recipe.  I made one change... I made it 3 layers.  After putting in the cream cheese portion, I then mixed a portion of the pumpkin and cheescake together, then put the pumpking alone on the top.  It comes out so good, rich and beautiful.  Thank you Stephanie for this delicious recipe.

I give this 4 stars for tasting quite good and for being extremely easy to make.  However, this doesn't compare to a real cheesecake that you bake totally from scratch and put in the water bath.  Still...if you have a sweet tooth, are impatient and have the ingredients on hand...make it.  Your mouth won't be disappointed.

So good. Used a water bath, baked the crust before putting the cheese cake in it, and quickly ran a knife around the cheesecake to separate it from the pan when it was done. No cracks, and it tasted great. Would have liked the non-pumpkin part to be thicker. Will make again.

Very good made it for my familys thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it! It was a nice change from the tradicional pumpking pie. I think I overcooked it though because it came out kind of flat. I will use other reviewers advice and add more cream cheese and sour cream next time but it was still rich and delicious as it is.thaks Stephanie

Pretty darn good! I did what one of the reviewers did and added one extra cream cheese, 1 cup of sour cream, and additional spices. I also put 2 cup of the cheesecake mix in the bottom and added a sprinkling of brown sugar to the pumpkin part and added a total of 1 cup pureed pumpkin. I also made my own crust with graham crackers, butter, and white sugar. It tasted like candy after it was done and my husband was singing my praises! I made it for his birthday and he was so excited! Great recipe- doesn't even need whipped cream. Will totally make again!

This cheesecake was so so. Nothing really that special. The family really really liked it, but I think I'll add more to the bottom layer next time. And a different topping to spice it up a bit.

This was absolutely delicious.. My entire family loved it. I did read some of the other reviews and added more of the cream cheese mixture so there was a much thicker layer and a little bit more pumpkin. I did have to use a deep dish pan but it came out excellent.

Wow, this was so good! I bought the "Keebler" prepared graham cracker pie crust and as an option, I followed the directions on their packaging to brown the crust first.  For the pumpkin puree, I bought the 'store brand' pure packed pumpkin. I used all 3 spices in the recipe(all McCormick brand), but I substituted 'ground nutmeg' for 'pumpkin pie spice.' Also, I baked my cheesecake at 350 for about 1 hour.

I don't usually like cheesecake, but this was wonderful!  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  I baked it in a 13 in graham cracker pie crust, and implemented all of the suggestions by SOUTHERNBELLE0908.  Also, I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice.

After reading a few reviews, I decided to make this pie for Thanksgiving and it was GREAT!! Creamy and rich and what I considered a perfect cheesecake! I did, however, take a few suggestions from previous users. I used pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin puree, and increased it to 1 cup and added a tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg. I also added a 3rd cream cheese. Used a deep dish graham cracker crust and it was great too. I took the suggestion of cooking for 1 hour then propping the oven door open and letting the pie set for one hour, NO CRACKS! So pretty! Excellent and will make every year from now on!

I made this cheesecake according to recipe. I liked it, but the pumpkin layer seemed to lack a little flavor. I think I'll add a few additional spices next time or use fresh pumpkin instead of canned.

Oh my was this good.  I made this twice in 3 days.  The first one was slightly underbaked but still great, but this one is amazing.  It needed about an extra 15 min in the oven.  No cracks!  I used pumpkin pie filling, 3/4 c sugar and pumpkin pie spice-about a teaspoon, instead of the other spices.  I also doubled the cinnamon.  I let it chill for 24 hours.  It was totally worth the wait!!!  I will definitely make again soon.  Next time I want to make my own crust and use my springform pan, though.

this was so amazing.  i brought it for thanksgiving and it was just delicious,  i ended up just using a premade grahm cracker crust and the pumpkin pie mix because cloves were expensive and i'd probably never use them again.  it was incredible, it tasted better than my aunts pumpkin cheesecake, it was more cheesecakey in my opinion with a pumpkin undertone. ughhh to die for.

This is absolutely terrific and very easy to make.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spice ingedients, and followed the advice of another reviewer who recommended adding a bit more plain cheesecake to the pie.  I would also categorize this as a triple layer dessert because if you are doing it right, you will make the whipped cream nice and thick and as important as the other two layers.  Very yummy and will make over & over.

I made this pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit! I baked it in a waterbath so there were no cracks and it was extra creamy. I also used suggestions and added 1 and 1/2 cups of the cheesecake mixture to the bottom of the crust before adding the pumpkin cheesecake mixture on top. Delish :)

This recipe was a big hit at my familys house on Thanksgiving. I took the original recipe here and then took some of the customs forms of the recipe and put it together. Like I first doubled the recipe using a 9 inch spring formed pan and that was a perfect thickness. Then added more pumpkin actually a whole large can of pumpkin puree and added double the amount and a half of the spices.  Then the one part of the recipe I changed was the crust.  I bought Ginger snap cookies the real good ones, Stauffer's they are the original and the best and made that the crumb crust. This just was the best I have ever made!!!  Thank you so much everyone for sharing!!!

Made it for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. By reading previous reviews I made some changes. I used organic pumpkin filling and did not add the cloves or nutmeg. I added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar. When pouring the layer for the cheesecake I did 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup, that way you can really see and taste the cheesecake. I baked it at 350 for 1 hr and left it 1 hr in the oven so that the crust would not crack. This is great for people who are not really into pumpkin pies.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dessert...and it was a tremendous hit.  So much so, I didn't even get to try a single slice, so now I'm going to have to make it AGAIN...just to be able to try it! There wasn't a crumb left in the pie tins, and I doubled the recipe! I added real vanilla beans to the mixture, a little smidge extra cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg...increased baking temp to 350 and baked in a water bath and ended up with perfection! Awesome recipe...no more regular pumpkin pies in our household - ever again!

I was not overly impressed with this recipe.  First, as other reviewers have stated, you need to add a lot more spices to have any flavor.  I doubled the spices called for and still could have used more.   Also, if you are making in your own 9" springform pan and not using a premade "tiny" crust from the store, you will need to double the recipe overall.  I used double ingredients and still came out with a pretty thin cheesecake.    For the bottom layer if you want a nice white layer to show, you'll need at least two cups of the pre-pumpkin / cheesecake only mix to start.   I used Splenda instead of sugar and found the cake was hardly sweet at all.  My parents liked this as they prefer non-sweet desserts, however I would have prefered it to be much sweeter.   Overall it was an okay recipe, but nothing that the family will be begging me to make again.

We made this because it sounded interesting and we love cheesecake.  Everyone loved it!  I added a pinch more of the spices, but pretty much just followed the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Just made this for thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Had the perfect amount of pumpkin to cheesecake! Refrigerated it overnight which really helped it set.

This is an EXCELLENT pumpkin cheesecake recipe! It's easy to follow and quick to prepare. I recommend using pumpkin pie filling and adding extra pinches of cinnamon & nutmeg. It's flavorful and you aren't playing the guessing game in terms of how much of each spice to add in. From personal experience, I usually bake mine for about 1 hour, let it sit to cool and then refrigerate overnight.   It's an all-time favorite--I've made this cheesecake for the last 3 years and everyone loves it!

This chessecake was great and very easy. My family loved it. One thing the pumpkin mixture wouldn't become smooth on the top of the chesse batter and it looked like a tye-dye.

I made these in tart form using texas sized muffin tins - what a hit!  I used the  Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe for the crust.  People were coming back for seconds and thirds!  Next time the only thing I will do is make more filling - the filling puffed and then fell a bit when it cooked - I thought it would stay a bit higher than it did.  Taste was awesome though!

This was awesome! I made a few changes. I used the pumpkin pie filling as previously mentioned but also used the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. I also added in a 1/2 c of light sour cream and folded it in after the eggs.  I was able to use Philadelphia cream cheese with 1/3 less fat and my cheesecake set up well. Lastly, I used a water bath to cook it set at 350 degrees for an hour and then let it cool with the oven cracked for an hour. I forgot to put the cool whip on but it was gobbled up regardless!!!

My two older brothers said I didn't need to make this because neither of them like cheesecake. They LOVED this pie!!!!!!  I too, make a bigger cheesecake layer to better see the definition of the two layers.

It was like eating a bar of cream cheese. Very thick and heavy. Might have been better with more seasoning but I won't making again.

Great recipe! I made a graham cracker crust with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. I made a few changes the second time around and it came out even better. I used the entire can of pumpkin puree, doubled the spices and vanilla extract, and beat the mixture until it was lump free and very smooth. I mixed everything up instead of doing the double layer and it came out much more like a real cheesecake. Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious! I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and double the pumpkin.    The frozen whipped topping is whipped cream, like cool whip. I didn't put any on mine, I think it is fine without it!

This was my first time making a cheesecake, let alone a pumpkin cheesecake. It came out sensational! My bf and I can't stop eating it.  I bought the puree but used pumpkin spice instead of buying spices separately. It made the process easier. I didn't have time to make my own crust, so I bought a prepared crust baking pan. Still came out great.  You definitely need to set the cream cheese at room temperature.  30 minutes wasn't enough time for the pie to bake fully. I left mine in the oven for 45 minutes. Very tasty. Will be making this for thanksgiving!

So yummy! Next time I will use a smaller pan so that it's taller. I used a 10 inch springform and the cheesecake was really shallow in it.

Fantastic! I made it once exactly as the recipe states and it was great. The second time I made it I added a little more pumpkin and it was even better. Everyone who has had a piece wants the recipe. This is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this.  I gave it 4 stars as I made it exactly as written, and after tasting the pumpkin filling before pouring it into the crust, had to add another 1/4 cup of sugar- it just wasn't sweet enough and tasted a bit off.  I personally like traditional pumpkin pie the best, and other flavors of cheesecake.

Yummy!  Awesome recipe and easy to make.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree and spices.  I also used the leftover pumpkin cheese cake mixture and baked them in mini graham cracker crusts.

I am not a cheesecake fan and I thought this was pretty good.  I used 1/2 cup plus 2tbs of sugar and cooked it for a total of 36 minutes.  The last minute I turned off the oven.  I will make this again.  Update: Instead of 1/2 cup of sugar I used 3/4 cup and baked the pie for 40 minutes.

Absolutely devine! Just what we were looking for because we don't like that strong pumpkin taste. It probably need a little bit more spices.

Took this to church for pot luck and had everyone raving! Personally, I thought it could use more "kick" like cinamon and nutmeg, and next time will add more of that to get a more pumpkin taste. Other than that, loved it!  Thank you!

Yum!  Used a gingersnap cookie crust (homemade cookie dough with less oil & sugar) & added more than a "pinch" of cloves & nutmeg.  Serve with the real whipping cream; it's cheesecake!  Just don't make gingersnap crust too thick at lower edge; powerful flavor.

I made this for a work potluck and it was completely devoured.  It was very easy to prepare (I did it without the electric mixer by hand once the cheese softened to room temp) and it's not overly sweet as some pies/cakes can be.  I highly, highly recommend this recipe for any dinner, you will be a complete hit at the party!

Made with no modifications and it was GREAT! Just THIN. I will probably double the recipe next time. I made two single recipes - the first batch made 12 cupcake size singles, the second made a thin 9" spring foam. Used Graham Cracker recipe from this site.

I used a store bought reduced-fat premade graham cracker crust. For the filling I used one package fat-free cream cheese and one regular. I did use about 3/4 cup of pumpkin rather than 1/2 because I really wanted to taste the pumpkin. D*E*LISH!!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! The only changes that I make are to increase it slightly to fit my spring form pan better. I make a crust from 1 inside pack of cinnamon gram crackers, 1/3rd cup sugar and 6 tbsp of butter. It is a really thick crust and tastes wonderful! I add in my homemade caramel sauce and whipped cream and it is irresistable!

I made this cake as our only dessert for Thanksgiving.  My Fiance who is not a fan of pumpkin LOVED this dessert and so I'm making it again right now.  It was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had and definitely the best I've ever made.  Plus it was super easy.  I made the crust myself though, buying one was more expensive than buying graham crackers, tins and butter.

Delicious! I used candied yams instead of pumpkin puree (couldn't find any) and it tasted just like a good old pumpkin cheese cake! However, I would suggest using a bit more yams than pumpkin puree since they don't have quit as much flavor.

Love this recipe! It was the first cheesecake I ever tried. Everyone in my family loved it. The only thing I've changed over time is adding more of the white filling to the bottom and adding more pumpkin to the top.

Wow this was really really good and very easy to make. Only thing I did was add more of the spices. It seemed kinda bland befor. I made 2 and my daughter put her name on one and my hubby who does not eat many sweets had 2 pieces! Soooo GOOOOODDDDD!

This is amazing, I make it every year at the holidays as my alternative to traditional pumpkin pie which I feel like everyone eats but no one really likes.  Then I started using this as a base recipe with different flavors ... I used this same idea but substituted strawberries and it was fabulous.  So I'll continue to try other flavors, but will still always use this as my pumpkin pie recipe.

This was easy to make and tasted great! I'm not a fan of pumpkin but my boyfriend is, and so I gave it a shot and I ended up eating more of it than he did! I did what a lot of people suggested and used pumpkin pie filling and sprinkled some pumpkin pie spice (comes in a little tin box) on top. The aroma was amazing. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't sure how "pumpkiny" it would taste, but it was delicious! Smooth, creamy, and the cloves and nutmeg give it a delicious warmth.

This was so delicious. I made a homemade graham cracker crust, & I think that it made it even better. I will leave the whipped topping off next time . I thought it took away from the taste of the filling.

I gave this 5 stars because it is SO easy to make, not too time consuming and tastes great!  This is a solid recipe to take to a picnic, party or for a holiday.  It's not a gourmet recipe; but, it is a definite crowd pleaser.  The flavor is nice and light and the whipped topping really adds a nice touch.  I used Cool Whip and have been adding the topping just before serving a slice as I made this for the family and it is being eaten over a few days time.  I will definetly make this one again!

My boyfriend said it was the best cheesecake or the best pumpkin pie he's ever had. It's a winner in both categories! I used pumpkin pie filling as well and skipped the spices.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  The pie was creamy and soft but not overly rich.  It had the perfect texture and the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't change anything and my roommates ate it in one sitting!

I have to say that this is one of my favorite cheesecakes to make, especially for the holidays.  When I make it, I like to melt about 3 tbsp of butter in a pan (on low heat), add about 8 oz. of chopped walnuts, sprinkle with about 1/4-1/2 cup of brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon, and brown for about 10 minutes.  Add half of this mixture in between the layers of the cheesecake, then put the rest of the mix on top of the cheesecake after about 15 minutes of baking...AMAZING.

I LOVE this recipe and have been making a similar cheesecake for years now. My only suggestion is to crush up ginger snaps and sprinkle them over the whipped topping, then lightly drizzle with a caramel sauce. Delicious!

OK, based on the superb ratings, must be something wrong with me, but we didn't care for this!  I made this for Thanksgiving'09. Didn't seem like a true cheesecake to me and we just didn't like the blend of flavors.  Not sure what we could do to improve it; probably won't try it again.  Just not our cup of tea, I guess.  Sorry.

I followed the advice of others and used pumpkin pie filling.  This turned out to be a very easy recipe, and it tasted great.  I will make it again next Thanksgiving.

Great and easy recipe! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! All other desserts were ignored. The boyfriend even requested this for his Christmas present! I used the pumpkin pie filling as suggested. From the 1 lb can I used 3/4 cup and i still had leftover batter. This pie will puff up while baked but it will settle down once it cools. Highly recommend!

used about 2 1/2 C of crushed grahm crackers (in the blender), then added about 1/4 C of sugar, then 1/2 C melted better, mixed it all with a fork, then used that for my crust. Yummy!

This is SOOOO good! For those who are having a tough time thinking it is enough batter...just use a beater and beat it well and it will get puffy and fill more than enough for a pie crust. It makes it light and creamy that way! Great recipe! Thanks!

This recipe was sooo easy.  This was my first Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his extended family, and they said that my dessert was the best out of all of them!  I did use 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of the 1/2 teaspoon that the recipe calls for.  It also needed to be baked 10 minutes longer in my oven, but otherwise, I didn't change anything.  I will definitely make this again.

My favorite dessert by far. I've made it probably 10 times this past year, and everyone who eats it loves it (even those who don't really like cheesecake or pumpkin pie)! I bake it on a cookie sheet with a little bit of water in the pan so that it doesn't crack. I also add a little bit more sugar and vanilla like others suggested. It's the perfect recipe!

Ah, This is a really good cheesecake. I was sure to use room temperature cream cheese and I actually made a homemade graham cracker crust out of Trader Joe's thick cinnamon graham crackers to go with it.  I had to bake this around 50 minutes before it was finished. Then I let it sit in the oven for a while, then the fridge over night. What amazed me was as the week went on, the taste got even better and better and soon it was SO DELICIOUS i was amazed I had even baked something so good! Around the third day!  Another plus about this recipe was how easy it was to bake... The whole thing (making the crust, and making the cheesecake) only took about 20 mins!!! I am making this again for Christmas dinner with family.

This is the recipe. Everyone loved it. I took some of the suggestions to increase the amount of cheesecake placed on the bottom.

I followed the suggestions of SouthernBelle0908 to add a third package of cream cheese and sour cream to the recipe and increase the pumpkin to a full cup.  It was so rich and creamy, and the pumpkin wasn't overpowering.  I've never been a fan of pumpkin pie, but this was absolutely delicious and a perfect ending to our Thanksgiving dinner this year.

I am always on the look out for low-sugar recipes since my husband and I both have had gastric bypass surgery.  I substituted 1/2 cup Splenda for the sugar.  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and increased the cream cheese to 3 pkgs and added a little more pumpkin for flavor.  Next time I might use the less fat version of the cream cheese to lower the fat content a bit.  I also baked it sitting in a cookie sheet with water and it turned out great!  Next time I'm thinking of trying different flavors in the top layer using sugar-free instant pudding...perhaps banana...chocolate?

This was yummy, but it did take quite a bit longer to bake than directed. I just kept a close eye on it until it looked set. The only other thing I might do differently next time is to make my own crust and bake in a springfoam pan. I just hate to use pre-made crusts because it doesn't look as nice in the aluminum pan, however it did taste good.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year instead of the standard pumpkin pie.  It turned out very good.  It is not a very sweet dessert, especially compared to the other desserts I made (pecan pie and chocolate chess pie.)  After taking a bite of one of the other desserts and then trying the cheesecake, the first bite or two of the cheesecake tasted almost sour in comparison.  So if you are looking for a sweet dessert, you may want to try something else, or add more sugar to this one.  I ended up with more pumpkin layer than I could fit in my pie pan, so I think I will try making a crustless pumpkin dessert next weekend with the leftovers.  It was simple to make and a nice change from the standard pumpkin pie.

I made my own graham cracker crust in a 9-inch springform and put it in there. I wish I had taken the suggestions to make it thicker, I wanted more! This was so creamy too! It made a beautiful cheesecake, no cracks at all.

Even finicky husband like this. Usually doesn't like to stray away from the typical pumpkin pie, but enjoyed this so much he had seconds. Was very good. Set well. There was more than enough to fill the 9-inch pie pan so made a small one on the side but other than that..great.

This turned out wonderfully and I received rave reviews. I did make a few changes: I made my own graham crumb crust, which included some pecans, I just 1 cup of pumpkin and twice as much cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla (I forgot the cloves altogether). I used 1.5 cups of cream cheese for the bottom layer. I ended up with slightly too much for a 9 inch pie crust. I baked for 40 minutes, in a shallow pan of water, and then let the pie sit in the oven (with the door slightly open) while the oven cooled down...no cracking at all. I sprinkled the top with crushed gingerbread cookies.

Excellent! This was my 1st time making a cheesecake and it was fool-proof. I made mine in a 9.5 inch spring form pan and it was a little flat. Next time I will double the recipe and maybe do 4 layers.
Mmmmm!

EXCELLENT Recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of all of the individual spices, I put 1 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice Blend... may put in a tad more next time... I also left the cheesecake in for about 10 minutes longer cooking, and then turned off the oven and left it in there for an additional 40 minutes. EVERYONE loved it... my boyfriend even yelled out "Why haven't you been making this the whole time?!?!?!?!" (-;

Great recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and added a pinch of ground cloves and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the pumpkin mixture. I used a gingersnap crust. This cheese cake had the perfect blend of spices and awesome flavor.

Wonderful!  I love pumpkin and cheesecake and this was the best of both worlds.  A perfect holiday dessert and quick and easy to make.  My husband HATES pumpkin and took a bite to humor me, his response- "That' is  good", followed by him slicing himself a piece.

Oh wow!! What a fantastic spin on cheesecake and on pumpkin pie! This had just the right amount of both. I added a bit more cream cheese (about 5 ounces?) than called for, and I thought it was perfect. I used fat free and reduced fat (a little of both) cream cheese, and you could not tell any difference. I added a layer of reduced fat Cool Whip, but I could take that or leave it - it didn't have much affect. I made my own graham cracker crust using a recipe from this site, and it was superb. I may try a mixture of graham cracker and gingersnap crust next time. I baked this in a 9" springform pan at 350F in a water bath for 60 minutes and then turned off the oven and opened the oven door and let it sit for an additional hour in the water bath. It was cooked perfectly throughout and did not crack. This sat in my refrigerator for 3 days before consumption, but the quality was unaffected. I will make this time and time again, I'm sure!!

Easy & Delicious pumpkin cheesecake recipe. I tweaked it a little bit. add 1/2 tsp more vanilla extract , 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon,  1/4 cup more of sugar, 1 cup more of pumpkin puree and 1 more package of cream cheese. Also, this made for 2 cheesecakes. So i used 2-9inch prepared graham cracker crusts.  Baked it for 1 hour. turned the temp off, opened the door and let the cheesecakes sit for 30 minutes. removed them from oven and let sit on counter for 1 hour. Then refrigerated for 4 hours. No cracks! beautiful presentation with the 2 layers..and soo freakin good! will be making more often not just thanksgiving. A must try!!

omg.  Made this last night and set to chill for Thanksgiving dinner this evening, but my husband HAD to "test" it this morning (how embarassing, so there will be ONE piece missing when it's served, but that's find because it will show the layers).... and I should have made TWO because I could eat all of it myself! it was so delicious!  Like another reviewer said, I will never make regular pumpkin pie again!  For beginners (like me) just use 3/4 cup Libby's pumpkin pie mix instead of the puree + spices. Makes it much easier! I did also increase to 1 tsp vanilla and the 1/2 cup PLUS 2 TBS sugar - of course after reading most of the reviews.  Can't wait for dinner tonight!

Perfect! Everyone at work and my husband LOVED it! I follwed recipe and it turned out perfect. I did cook a little longer, but I used the Graham Cracker Crust Recipe on this website. I had to chill the crust an hour before cooking. This may be the reason for the longer cook time for myself! A++

Excellent!  I made it by the directions the first time this weekend and it was gobbled up without me even getting a slice.  So I made one today to bring into work, this time I used a bit more cheesecake on the bottom layer to even out the layers since the pumpkin layer was so thick on the first one, and used a whole tsp. of vanilla and a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon.  Next time (thanksgiving day) I am going to try it with Pumpkin Pie Filing and see how it works.  However, for pumpkin pie lovers and cheesecake fans this is a delicious recipe and I am sure I will be making it for years to come, it was a hit!

Really good recipe. I used 3 egg whites instead of the 2 whole eggs. I also ran out of cream cheese I only had 12 oz of cream cheese I substituted the other 4 oz with ricotta cheese. I used fat free cream cheese. I added a layer of pecans. For some reason at the grocery store I went to the whole pecans were less expensive than the chopped. I chopped them up at home. I then drizzled caramel topping onto to it and a layer of whipped cream. I used the caramel ice cream topping. It came out delicious.

I made this recipe into mini-cupcake cheesecakes, just to try something different.  They came out really well.  The traditional cheesecake layer is much denser so it worked well for the bottom.  The pumpkin layer has a light, almost whipped texture.  This is not my favorite cheesecake recipe, but the pumpkin is fun for the season!

This was very good. I enjoyed it very much. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my husband said he didn't like it. I can't figure it out. He likes pumpkin and cheesecake. Oh well... all the more for me! Thanks.

Very tasty.  I'm not a huge pumpkin fan but I was able to handle this since it was more of a cream cheese flavor.  I did add an extra thing of cream cheese but since my pie shell wasn't a deep dish I had WAY too much filling.  I'll just save it and make another one soon!

Finished texture is a little egg-y, but it tastes like great pumpkin pie. I also would tend to go with others who said they want more regular cheese cake. I think you wouldn't need whipped cream if the proportions were a little more even.

Yummy and very simple, esp using the libby's easy pumpkin pie filling like I did. Next time I think I will bake it a little longer because it was a little runny.

My sixteen year asked me not to making "boring pumpkin pie" for our Cdn thanksgiving....so I tried this one for a change.  We all loved it.  The graham cracker crust was a great variation, and I used Epicure pumpkin pie spice...it was wonderful.

Soooo good!  I made some changes as per previous reviewers.  1. I used three blocks of cream cheese 2. I added all-spice, lots of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of sugar to my pumpkin puree 3. I added 1/2 cup of sour cream after I added the eggs.  Instead of the white layer on the bottom, I swirled it on top.  It looked and tasted soooo amazing!  So creamy and rich my family was convinced I bought it.  I also made my own crust (a box of ginersnaps and 1/4 cup of melted butter.  Baked in the oven for 10 minutes.

Really good! I used a 10 inch springform pan which made it quite thin. I also added the whole can of pumpkin and it was fabulous I wouldn't make it any other way! (The whole can = about 1 cup and 1/4 c). Topped with caramel sauce and pecans!

Great overall, and well received by folks of all ages.  I substituted ginger for nutmeg which gave it a nice flavour. I found it a bit soft overall.  Perhaps I didn't bake it quite long enough.

Great recipe.  Easy and quick to make.  Used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.

Excellent Recipe...made in a gingersnap/hazelnut crust..I also used 3 packs cream cheese and 3 eggs plus 1 cup of sugar...only so it would make a larger cheesecake.  Also used pumpkin pie puree with spices already added!! My neighbors loved it!! One said I should enter it in a contest!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was wonderful. I might just skip making pumpkin pie on holidays now, and make this instead. The only thing I think I will do differently in the future, is bake about 10 more minutes, the very center was just a little too soft. Thanks for a great recipe!

The biggest hit at Thanksgiving and have been asked to make it again this year.  I don't like pumpkin pie so I was very hesitant to make this, but it's just a nice amount of the flavour.  Yum!

Fantastic!  I used a spring form pan and had excellent results.  There was little evidence that the cheesecake had ever existed.  Next time I'll try a gingersnap crust.

Fabulous!  This has replaced our traditional Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie.  My only suggestion is don't use whipped cream cheese.  No fault of the recipe submitter, I flubbed that one.  So block cream cheese it is from now on.  Great recipe Stephanie!

This is the best Cheesecake ever!  I modified it a little just because we don't like cloves so I left those out but I kept everything else the same and it was delicious! It gets better as it sits too.  It was at it's best on the third day! Definitely going to make this again!

I made this in a 9" springform and it was a bit flat. Still delicious, but next time I'll use a smaller pan or double the filling to get a thicker cheesecake.

Wow!  Easy, super delicious...a recipe to keep and use over and over and over again!  I made no substitutions apart from making my own crust using a recipe from this site (Graham Cracker Crust I...which was also a great recipe).  I can't wait to make this pie/cheesecake for my friends!

I love this recipe. I made it for two family gatherings over Thanksgiving and got rave reviews both times. The only thing I did different than the recipe was take out more than a cup of the plain cheesecake batter for the bottom layer. I probably did 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 of a cup to get a little thicker bottom layer.

I made these for thanksgiving and they were a hit! As a young newlywed who had NEVER cooked thanksgiving dinner everything turned out great and I had 4 people ask me for the recipe for the pumpkin cheesecake.  The only thing that I changed was using pumpkin pie mix instead of puree because it already has all the spices mixed in.  I will make it again!

Delicious!!! I have made this several times on a 14x11 glass pan to serve more people. I use a whole box of graham cracker crust and follow the directions to making the crust. And for the other 2 layers I just double everything else. However, on the seasoning i still use a pinch of Nutmeg and a pinch of Ground Cloves. A lot of people don't seem to like the strong aroma.

Thank you very much for this recipe.

Yummy!! This cheesecake was great! Lots of people asked for the recipe. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet, like some cheesecakes can be. I also added pumpkin pie spice. Thank you!

My first attempt at a cheesecake and wow. Since I had a 1/2 extra block of cream cheese in my fridge, I added that too (for a total of 2.5 blocks). I cooked it for 43 minutes and it came out perfectly (no cracking). Delicious result even without whipped topping.

I was excited to try this recipe, but the result was a cheesecake that still tasted like a brick of cream cheese.  Very bland.

This was a huge hit!  I doubled the recipe to make two of them and used 5 cases of cream cheese and wanted more of a cheesecake layer, so spread a cup and a half of it on the first layer.  I also used the pumpkin pie filling instead and it came out soooo delicious and perfect!

My husband requested a pumpkin cheesecake this Thanksgiving. After search many recipes we decided to give this one a try. It was delicious! Everyone loved it! And looked so great when sliced. I'm not a pumkin pie fan but this was wonderful! It's already been requested again for next Thanksgiving.

This pie is a "wow". I'm so glad I made it! Now that I've had this, there's no going back to plain ole cheesecake or traditional pumpkin pie! After looking at some of the other reviews, I just doubled the spices and baked it in a water bath. It came out perfect.

This turned out so creamy and delicious! I used 3 packages of cream cheese as suggested in reviews and used a cup and a half of it for the bottom layer, then added my pumpkin to the rest. I used a 10 inch spring form pan and it was just right.

Give it at least three days in the fridge. The flavor and texture improve significantly.

OMG!! This is the BEST Pumpkin Cheesecake!! I made it for our Thanksgiving potluck at work and it was gone literally in minutes. In fact I was asked why I didn't make two of them. Everyone wanted the recipe, so I had to print it off and make copies for everyone. I will make this again over and over. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was fabulous!  I did make a few slight changes - I increased the spices and added 1/3 c. of extra pumkpin puree (but only because I was making 2 and I just split the can of pumpkin between the 2 batches).  I also followed the advice of the others and let my ingredients come to room temperature first and only ended up with 1 little crack in one of the cheesecakes.  At the request of my family, I will be making 2 more of them tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Bf adores cheesecake, so him liking it is a no brainer.  He liked it; so did I (I'm not a cheesecake fan at all).  I revered the directions a bit; I really didn't want a tiny bit of cheesecake layer with a large pumpkin layer, so I mixed about 1  cup of the cheese filling in with the pumpkin mixture and put teh remaining cheese mixture on as a layer.  I ended up with about equal layers.  My layers were very small bc I used a springform pan, but that's okay.  The way the bf eats cheesecake, it's probably better to have smaller slices!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I increased the cheese cake layer and the amount of pumpkin and spices.  I also made a crust out of ginger snaps which was yummy.

Very nice recipe. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and used real whipped cream for the topping with a pinch of cinnamon whipped in. Had it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.

Very good!  I like to add more then 1 cup of the mix at the bottom because it's not enough to give it the layered affect.

I have been making this cheesecake every Thanksgiving for the past few years and it is sooooo good! Everyone in my family loves it...including those who don't like traditional pumpkin pie. My sister even asked me to make one for her to take to her in-laws with her last Thanksgiving. It is definitely a winner!

WOW!!! I did the same as most and made a thicker layer of cheesecake on the bottom. I love pumpkin pie and I LOVE cheesecake so this was perfect. My dad loves pumpkin but doesn't like all the spices in pumpkin pie, so I had him try this and he loves it. Theres just enough pumpkin to taste. I also had an ice cream topping of caramel that i drizzeled on top...mmmmmm my boyfriend and family loved it.

We have made this several times, in fact, every time we find cream cheese on sale at the store we bake this cake. There was a tip on here (that I found the first time I made this) that was very helpful. Due to all the praise this cheesecake deserves it has dissapeared into the masses. The center will not crack if you use eggs at room temp. Thanks- whoever you were- and thank you Stephanie P. for this awesome recipe!!!

My entire family loves this great cheescake. It's so easy to make but looks like it took hours, and the taste has every family member during the holidays request it again for next year. Add a big dollop of  French Vanilla Cool Whip and you've got a deelish dessert.

Amazing recipe! Even folks in my house that aren't partial to pumpkin fell in love with this cheesecake. I followed SPRING1ONU's advice and used pumpkin pie filling. I used a regular 9 inch graham cracker crust and added 1/4th teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning to the pumpkin mixture for a wee kick and bumped up the vanilla to 1 tsp. It tasted fantastic! I will absolutely make this again.

I'm not a cheesecake fan but I found this recipe pretty good.  Everyone that tried it loved it. I did make a few changes.  I didn't use a prepared graham crust; I made my own grinding honey graham then adding melted butter (Graham cracker crust 2) is the recipe that I used.  I also used 1 cup of pumpkin puree and half a cup of sour cream to ease the saltiness in the cream cheese.  I served my cheesecake with whipped cream and an amazing sauce taken from(Pumpkin Cookies V) recipe which in that recipe is the glaze.  That gave it a nice kick.

Very good cheesecake. It came out very "flat", so next time I will add 3 blocks of cream cheese and use a smaller springform pan.  I did add 1/2 cup sour cream which made it light and baked in a water bath.  Served with homemade whipped cream (heavy cream, sour cream, vanilla and confectioner's sugar).

This was a good recipe but not great. It was more pumpkin pie than what I consider a good cheesecake. If you like no-bake cheesecakes and ones that whip up real easy, this is something for you however, if you're like me and want the baked more New York tasting cheesecake this is not it. For what it is, it is good though.

Great cheesecake. I doubled the amount of pumpkin and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. Nice flavor, and not too cream-cheesy. I didn't feel the layering was a necessity, but it makes it look really nice!

This is a new family favorite. I made it with shortbread crust and brown sugar sauce on top of baked cheesecake. Cool whip layer completed a delicious Christmas 2007 dessert.

This was SO good and SO easy.  I cheated and used a prepared crust.  Batter was not quite enough, might need to increase it by 1/3 or so to fill up the pie pan - if I had made the crust from scratch and used a springform pan, would have needed to double it probably.  I cooked at 325 for about 40 minutes and then allowed it to cool in the oven (off) with the door open for an hour.  Then allowed it to completely cool before refrigerating it.  The center should jiggle like jello and the pie should be firmer on the edges - done!

this recipe is fabulous! I made a few small changes...per previous reviews.I used the whole can of pumpkin,added an extra 4oz. cream cheese, 1/2 c. sour cream, also added 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the crust. Baked in a 9" springform pan and it came out wonderful!! It was a very light cheesecake..didn't give us that "stuffed feeling". Thanx for sharing!

Cheese cake is always wonderful, as was this one.  But there just wasn't much "pumpkin" flavor...  I did use fresh mashed pumpkin vs. canned...  maybe that was the difference.

I didnt make this or even tasted it, but my 14 year old daughter made this to bring to her dads on Thanksgiving. It was the first pie to go and people who never eat pie or cheesecake loved it. So given the ease of the pie and the reveiew its a 5 star....

This is OK. I bumped up the spice quantities considerably to suit my family's tastes in addition to using pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin puree, and I still found it to be a little bit "blah".  Also, I cooked mine for 55 minutes and I felt that it would have benefited from a few more minutes of bake time once I sampled it.  I like a really firm, dense cheesecake though, and this was my first attempt at making anything like this.

This was fantastic!! I used the suggestions of Southernbell, and added an extra package of cream cheese and sour cream at the end. I also added an additional 2 TBSP Sugar. I had planned to bake this in a water bath, but found out too late that my 10 in Springform wouldn't fit in my largest baking dish. I ended up baking as written, and although it cracked on the top, after adding the whipped cream topping, no one noticed. 
My mother-in-law (who is not know for offering compliments) thought it was great and even asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful, although I did change it.  The filling I made 1.5 times the recipe, added more pumpkin than called for and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 allspice instead of cloves.  I also used a gingersnap cookie crust with almonds which I felt went better with the pumpkin flavor.  Then instead of layering it I pulled out the plain as said and I used it to marble it to make it look prettier.  I filled the crust with the pumpkin and then dropped spoonfuls of the regular and dragged a butter knife through it.  I baked for 55 minutes then turned the oven off and left it in to cool so that it wouldn't crack.  It was beautiful and tasted phenominal.  Big hit at our Thanksgiving party!

This recipe is fantastic! I manage a kitchen at a college and I made this for our Thanksgiving meal. I multiplied everything by 10 and it fit perfectly on a sheet pan. It was the perfect consistency and it disappeared as soon as I put it out! Best Ever!

Very good recipe. I made mine mini versions in cupcake tins and used crushed cinnamon graham crackers as the crust for an added touch. I used prepared pie filling but also added the additional spices.Baked for thirty minutes and when cool, placed in the freezer for three hours or so. They came out perfect and everyone loved them!Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Excellent! I was a little concerned that the pumpkin flavor would be lost in the cheesecake since so little pumpkin (1/2 cup) is used in the recipe. However, it ended up being a great combination. I baked this in a gingersnap crust, which added some extra spice and was wonderful. We served it for Thanksgiving dessert topped with Cool Whip and it was a favorite!

This was my first time making a cheesecake, and I must say it can out wonderful! It was so incredibly easy and delicious. My pie layers were distinct and beautiful. I am very proud of myself. The next time, I will follow Southern Belle's suggestions and bake in a springform pan to make a more dense cheesecake. I also followed other suggested reviews and added 2 more TBLS pumpkin pie filling and increased the spices. Thank you so very much for sharing.

I made this to take to my in laws Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit!  Very easy to make and it turned out perfectly!  I followed some of the tips from others and used 3 8 ounce packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream added after the eggs are beaten in.  It is definitely a cheesecake with a mild pumpkin flavor...so if you dont like cheesecake, don't try it.  I got some Cool Whip to serve with it, but it really didn't need it.  Wonderful texture.  My husband is not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but he thought it was delicious.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe I will make again and again.

This turned out really good.  I had trouble deciding whether to make regular pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake so I added a lot more pumpkin to this recipe (with the spices).  It was really good and I found that it only got better with time.  I would refridgerate it at least overnight.

YUM!  I followed this recipes with the exception of using canned pumpkin pie and adding the extra spices.  For alittle decoration on the top I swirled a tsp amount of left over pumpkin pie mix in 4 or 5 different spots.  My husband commented that they looked like leaves.  I wouldn't put too much in one spot as it can lead to cracking.  This dessert did very well in my son's boyscout auction!  I also made one for our family with a regular pie crust and it was very tasty.  DO TRY!

I'd make this with all pumpkin next time. You can use pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual seasonings. I added ginger to the batter.

after reading many reviews i had to try this. i made mine using vanilla wafers for the crust instead of the graham cracker crumbs. i also used more spices in the pumpkin mixture and spiced up the cream cheese. i added sliced almonds to the top before baking. i loved this. my husband is the type who only likes tried and true recipes, but even he loved this one. i will make this again. great for the holidays.

I thought this was okay - the texture wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  It almost looked undercooked - I prefer a more solid feel.  It definitely tasted better the second day.  I might try it again using a springform pan - I used the pre-made crust as directed to save time.  It was okay, just not as great as I expected based on all the reviews.

This was good, probably better if I added the nutmeg or allspice, my kids have nut allergies and I do not want to take a chance.  But the family loved it and it looks great with the two layers.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to throw together for those last minute guests you may have (provided you have pumpkin puree on hand, that is!)  I used low fat cream cheese to cut down on fat, but then reloaded it back on w/making a homemade graham cracker crust from this website, and topping it w/whipped topping.  Oh well, it was worth it!  Husband and in-laws loved it.

What a delicious and easy cheesecake recipe!  I added a cup of sour cream to the batter and used 1 cup of fresh pumpkin.  I topped the cool cheesecake with a butterscotch glaze (1 cup melted butterscotch chips with a few tablespoons heavy cream) and it was SO GOOD--the guests at the dinner party completely devoured it.

I made this for a big party and everyone went crazy over it. While I loved the look of the double layer, next time I will make the whole cheesecake just the pumpkin mixture. I also increased the pumpkin in the recipe.

This cheescake is delicious if you love pumpkin pie and cheesecake, however I have a few suggestions.  Rather than using a regular pie plate (I made my own graham cracker crust), I would use a springform pan and more pumpkin cheescake filling.  It came out rather low for a cheesecake (despite the picture), maybe an inch high.  I didn't read many reviews before baking, but I am sure people have mentioned soaking the pie, still in pan, in a warm water bath to help release it when slicing. It also takes quite a bit of time for actual eating so I recommend baking it the night before eating.  Other than time and cake height, it was quite tasty.

This is a winner.  I've made it a couple of times since Thanksgiving and each time it was a hit!  Sometimes I make it in the ready made pie crust and sometimes I make it as a traditional cheese cake in the springform pan.  Either way - fantastic - thanks!

This was pretty good.  It was thin but tasted good.  I live in the UK and nobody eats pumpkin pie so I thought of pumpkin cheesecake.. but nobody looked twice at it, other than me...  I liked it though.

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was really great. But what I also did was make a carmel sauce that was served hot and the pie was served cold and it made it even better.

I really do not like pumpkin pie but I wanted a traditional pie for our Thanksgiving dinner. My sister e-mailed me this recipe and said I should try it since it got 5 stars and so many people reviewed it. Anyway, I made the cheesecake and it was a big hit! The cheesecake was completely gone within 20 minutes of taking it out of the fridge. =D And the best part is I loved it which is amazing since I don't like pumpkin at all. Anyway, try it. You won't regret it! =P

I love cheesecake, and I enjoy all the warm fall flavors of pumpkin pie, so I thought this would accomdodate all of those. It was very pretty, but it lacked something, I'm not sure what. I even added extra pumpkin according to other's reviews, added more spices and it was still a bit bland.

It was VERY easy to make, took about 5 minutes.  I increased the baking time to about 1 hour.  The family liked it on Thanksgiving, but it wasn't "AWESOME!!", it was "That's pretty good."

This was even better than I was expecting. It tasted great and was extremely easy. It deserves 6 stars. I did like others suggested and used 3/4 cup pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree. This allowed me to leave out the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. It turned out so good that noone remembered to put whipped topping on it.

I made this as an alternative to the standard, dense pumpkin pie.  It was very light and fluffy, and quite tasty.  I used 'Baking Spice' in place of the cinnamon, and still used the other spices.  It was perfect.  It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor with such an airy texture.  It was also very easy to make.  It was hit!  I will definitely make this again.

I used a 10inch pie crust and it was FULL! A 9 inch would have probably overflowed! Of course I did use a little extra pumpkin...it was a HIT!!

I must have undercooked this or didn't refrigerate for as a long as i was supposed to-- it was much too soft. i liked the cream cheese layer on the bottom but it was otherwise an ordinary tasting cheesecake. the pumpkin layer was very mild. i would add more pumpkin puree and  almost double the spices...maybe even add some ginger.

I made this recipe and it was a disaster - but I think it was mostly my fault. First - I didn't have canned pumpkin so I used real pumpkin to make puree and the overall product was too runny, inconsistent and the overall presentation wasn't that nice. I also followed the cooking instructions and the bottom was burnt black so it was unedible. Next time I'll use canned pumpkin, double the middle and turn down the heat.

DELISH!  I usually don't like anything pumpkin.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese and one can of pure pumpkin.  Then after it had cooled for an hour with the oven door open, I pour a caramel sauce from this site over the top.  I served with whipped topping and my guests thought they were in heaven.  It's not too 'pumpkiny' so don't be afraid to make it if you aren't a fan like me.

This was so easy and so good - I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved the result (in fact, I think I'll keep making it, Thanksgiving or not).  This was the only dish I made that didn't yield any leftovers...

This turned out really good.  The consistency was perfect.  I used fresh pumpkin and added a little more than the recipe called for to get more of a pumpkiny flavor.  This cheesecake is not overly sweet so if you like really sweet desserts, add more sugar.

This is a pretty good and easy recipe. But, I definitely think the pumpkin mixture needs more spices. Where it says "a pinch" - figure on using at least 1/4 tsp. if not more. I would also recommend wiping the knife blade in between each cut you make when serving so that the layers don't smear and it makes for a nicer presentation.

I've made this recipe the past 4 Thanksgivings and it is always a hit. My brother inlaw says I have to make every year from here on out. This year I think I will sub a gingersnap crust to add a little bit extra.

I made this instead of the traditional Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie last year, and it was a BIG hit.   I had to make more the day after Thanksgiving: there'd been no leftovers to bring home!

OMG was this delicious!!! I thought I had a great recipe for a pumpkin cheesecake, but this one made mine step aside. Not only did it come out perfectly, but the consistency was smoother than smooth - creamy beyond creamy. I could have eaten the entire pie in one sitting. The only thing I did differently was add 1 tsp. of vanilla (instead of 1/2 tsp.)and used pumpkin pie mix in lieu of the pumpkin puree and individual spices. I will definitely be making this again...and again!

Awesome!  Perfect for families like mine, where some find regular cheesecake a little too rich.  This is really easy to make, and the result is consistently great!

I love this but I do up it by one third and this time I used a gingersnap and graham cracker crust which gave it a little zest. Wow it was so good.. no whipped topping, only fresh whipped cream in dollups.

I love this pie, I have made it 2 years in a row.  It is a wonderful change from the normal pumpkin pie. But since I normally make a regular pumpkin pie...I pore more of the cheesecake mix in the bottom and just top with the pumkin mix.  Its a hit!!!!

I have making this recipe since Thanksgiving 2000.  My brother requests this as his birthday present.  Family, friends and coworkers LOVE this cheesecake.  I will often add more pumpkin.
I found that softer the cream cheese the better it blends together.  I also add a dash of pumpkin pie spice

The prep was super easy, and the taste was fantastic, but I think a good cheesecake needs to be cooked longer at a lower temp. This one didn't set as well as it could have. I will definitely make again, but I will adjust the cooking time and temp.

This was a great cheesecake recipe!  I drizzled caramel ice cream topping in the bottom of the crust before I put the first layer of cheesecake in.  It baked up perfect and added a praline taste to the perfect pumpkin flavor.  Great recipe for fall.  Will make over and over.  This one is going in the recipe book I use all the time.  I did use pumpkin pie spice, and it was just the perfect combination.  Plan on making this one for Thanksgiving at my mother's.  Thanks Stephanie!

This is the easiest and most delicious alternative to traditional pumpkin pie around.  I made it even easier with the advice from a fellow reviewer by using pre-made pumpkin pie mix in a can instead of pumpkin + spices.  Plates up nicely too due to the stunning contrast of the layers.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This cheesecake was gobbled up for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe.  I replaced the spices with pumpkin pie spice as I didn't have any gnd cloves on hand.  The spices were just right.  I will definitely be making this again.  It is a nice change from the typical seasonal pumpkin pie and very EASY to make (especially with a store bought graham cracker crust)!

I used ginger snaps to make the crust, and it turned out really well even though I've never made cheesecake before. I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it. Definately a keeper. Oh, and I didn't change anything in this recipe besides the crust.

This turned out great! It looked flawless with a bottom layer of cheesecake and a top layer of pumpkiny cheesecake! It cut perfectly, tasted smooth and creamy and EVERYONE loved it! I also made a glazed apple cream pie and a pecan sweet potato pie but no-one has even tried them yet because everyone was so busy wolfing down this cheesecake!

I work in a nursing home and we have a big family Thanksgiving dinner every year.  This year I made this recipe and I got raves... I increased the recipe to feed 200 people and it turned out so well.  I did put it in a homemade graham cracker crust, but everything else was per the recipe...Easy to do...

Cheesecakes have always been one of the toughest deserts to make (in my opinion).  This one was pretty easy and turned out great tasting, but was a little hard to cut neatly... maybe I didn't cook it quite long enough?  The top cracked, but it still looked good.  It has a consistency somewhere between a pumpkin pie and a cheesecake.
I thought about making it in my springform pan like others suggested, but opted for a regular 9 inch pie plate.  The batter filled the pie plate and then some, so there is definitely no need to multiply the recipe for more thickness.

Yummy and SO easy!!  I used Fat Free cream cheese (so the filling was fat free) and it turned out wonderfully.  I also used a regular pie crust, because I had it on hand, it made it taste more like a creamy pumkin pie and less like a cheese cake, but it was still great.

Awersome! My entire family including in-laws ask me to make this pie even in summer time! Try it - you will not regret. I use more than a pinch of spices, and also add allspice.

This was my first attempt at baking a cheesecake, and it came out pretty good!  Next time, I will use a full can of pumpkin.  I used light cream cheese and it came out great.  It would have likely been richer with regular cream cheese.  Also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted apple pie spice.  I was a little more generous with the vanilla as well.  I am trying to save some for the family, but I may have to make them another.  I also topped it off with the squeezable caramel--fantastic!

I am not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, but for Thanksgiving I feel like I have to make one for everyone else.  This was a wonderful alternative.  My young children loved it as much as I did.  This will be a standard Thanksgiving pie at our house.  Thanks for sharing!

I used the gingersnap crust instead of graham cracker crust to give it a bit of a kick.  Only one daughter preferred pumpkin pie over this because she didn't like the cheesecake texture.  I gave a piece to a neighbor from South Africa and she thought it was "exquisite" and wants the recipe! Will definitely make this again.

Very good.  To help set I placed the pie in the fridge after adding the cheescake portion, I left it in the fridge only long enough to mix the rest of the toppings into the cheesecake mixture.  this was a big hit with my guests

I also made this for Thanksgiving. I followed another reviewers suggestion and made the bottom layer a little bit higher with just the cream cheese mixture. I made this in a gingersnap crust and it was absolutely delicious! Even my 1 year old baby loved it. I will definitely be making this again and again!

It doesn't get much better than this.  This recipe is so easy and is sooo good.  I topped it with homemade whipped topping and little swirls of carmel ice cream topping.  This pie is a new Thanksgiving tradition.  Thank you so much.

My family loved this cheesecake. I followed another reviewers tip and baked the cheesecake in a "water bath". I used a cookie sheet and filled the bottom with a layer of water. The texture was perfect and smooth.

very tasty and creamy, lighter and way less dense than a normal cheesecake.  i did 3/4 sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  boyfriend said "not pumpkiny enough" and he might "make regular pumpkin pie mix" for the top layer somehow next time.  regardless, will make again and is 5 stars because of how simple this recipe is.

Thank you so much! This recipe rocks and it was so easy. This was my first time making any kind of cheesecake. I did use 3/4c sugar, 1t vanilla, and 1c of the pumpkin for more flavor as suggested by others. I did have to bake for about an hour though. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving and I was asked to make it for Christmas. The best pumpkin cheesecake recipe.

This recipe turned out great! I made a few varriations to cater to my families taste by using a home-made gingersnap cookie crust with chopped pistachios, which really added to the flavour. We didn't add the third layer of whipped cream, it really wasn't necessary as the pie was good enough by itself!

This was delicious, and really easy to make!  It did taste a little funny, but I think it was either because I microwaved the cream cheese to soften it, or because I used fat free generic cream cheese.  I will make this again, this time with brand name light cream cheese, and I'll let it soften at room temperature.  Very good, easy, and pretty dessert!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It was the first anything I've made from scratch and it was so easy.  I will be making this for every Thanksgiving.

Awesome!  Imagine my surprise when my 9-year-old nephew (who never likes ANYTHING) had TWO pieces.  I used canned pumpkin and a store-bought crust to save time, but it still came out great!

This is a wonderful alternative to a "traditional" pumpkin pie. You get all the wonderful flavor, but not the same texture. It's especially wonderful for those cheesecake lovers out there like myself. My family loved it and I've been asked to make it anytime, not just on Thanksgiving.

This recipe was fairly easy to make.  My husband thought it was very good.  He did say that it would taste even better if you used a thicker crust that was more flavorful than the graham crust.

This cheesecake was a hit for Thanksgiving!!  I have never got so many compliments in my life on something that was very easy to make....made me feel almost guilty.  I used 1/3 less fate cream cheese and didn't miss it at all...neither did anyone else.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made.  I thought for sure without a water bath that it would crack, but it actually didn't have any cracks at all.  I made it in my food processor so it really didn't take a lot of time, and it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Everyone including my pumpkin-hater father-in-law loved this.  It is a sure winner.

I really loved this. I normally don't like pumpkin pie but the cream cheese took that pumpkin "edge" off and it was delicious. My husband didn't like it as much because he didn't think it was "pumpkiny-enough"; however, he still said it was good. My kids (aged 5 & 2) also ate it and seemed to like it.

Great holiday recipe.  I’ve used both store bought graham cracker crust as well as making my own crust and they both turn out awesome.  I've also subbed out the pumpkin puree and spices with pumpkin spice mix and it still tastes great!

I made this according to user BonnieJo Roberts suggestions - adding 8 ounces of cream cheese and 1/2 a cup sour cream  and leaving cake in oven with oven door open for 1 additional hour after baking - and it turned out PERFECTLY.

A delicate and delightfully refreshing flavor with a simple assembly and clear instructions.

Made one to take to a family get-together and it was gone almost before it was sliced up. I enjoyed it so much I made a second one just to have at home, and it didn't last very long either.

100% do recommend.

This recipe was such a success with my husband, that I make it as his favorite special treat now. He even asks me to make it every year for his company’s annual holiday dinner. 
I love how easy it is...much easier than a typical cheesecake!

I usually make this perfect but this last time i bought cheap cream cheese instead of the good stuff and it turned out horrible. My advice, don't skimp on the brand you use. The recipe says. Cook 40 minutes which is never long enough. This time i cooked it too long though. Also, mix in eggs slowly. Mine turned out like a quiche texture. Awful.

This is a simple and delicious dessert!   I've made it several times now always to rave reviews.  There's enough pumpkin flavor to add interest without being overbearing and the overall cheesecake texture is excellent.  It doesnt even crack despite not using a waterbath!

So good. Brought this to Christmas dinner. Loved the taste of the spices. Pumpkin taste without being overly pumpkin-y. Even my cousin who doesn't like pumpkin pie liked it.

I don't like cheese cake or pumpkin pies, but this recipe combines both to make a more pleasant flavor and texture.  The marriage of the two, make it a very desirable dessert for all.  I didn't screw with the recipe like most people feel that they need to do. and it was excellent.  I made one in a glass pie plate and one in a spring form and both were equally awesome!

Awesome recipe! I’ve been making it for over 10 years as one of my staples for holiday gatherings. My father-in-law looks forward to it every year and my mother has asked me for the recipe to bring to other gatherings. I have used the pumpkin pie filling as well if I’m shopping at a store with a smaller selection for the reason of it having the seasonings already included and don’t find much of a difference in taste to using the purée

BEST PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE EVER!  The recipe is very easy. I used a slightly bit more pumpkin pie puree and I did add the spices despite using pumpkim pie puree which already has the spices. I sprinkled pumpkin pie spice all over the top of the pie. It was sooo good.

I made this with some minor tweaking of the basic recipe.  I used my basic New York Style Cheesecake and incorporated the elements of the Pumpkin Spice recipe.  I have to say this was the best cheesecake I ever made.  I have had requests for Christmas already.

I bought a can of Libby's pumpkin and used half of the spices on the can save for cloves. i subbed allspice. One can is plenty to make 2 pies. other than that, I followed the  recipe exactly. I served this at my Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE loved it! In past years I bought a pumpkin cheesecake at Bob Evans. No more! this recipe is super easy!

I took the advice from another reviewer & added 3 packages of cream cheese + 1/2 cup sour cream & upped the spices a bit. Made my own 10" ginger snap crust & topped with a caramel sauce. Impressive presentation & people "raved" about the taste...said it was high end restaurant quality.

We were disappointed in how little pumpkin flavor pie ended up with.  Would put in a little less cream cheese and a little more pumpkin. Still ate the whole pie !!!

This pie won Thanksgiving. We had a pumpkin pie, apple pie, cherry pie, and this pie. Everyone had a piece and all were gushing over how delicious it was. There was none left over. 
I used a pre-made graham cracker crust but will probably make my own next time. I made fresh whipped cream which was also a hit. The spices weren’t too much, but you could taste all of the flavors dancing around your mouth with delight. 
Next time I will make two.

Big hit with my family!  It was smooth and creamy and just the perfect mix. I did add more pumpkin to the pumpkin mix to have a stronger pumpkin flavor.

This was delicious and so easy a cheesecake novice like me could do it!  I made it in a springform pan I thought was 9", but may have been bigger?  The cheesecake layer wasn't super thick, so I might make 1.5x the recipe for next time.  With only 1c of the non-pumpkin layer, it was so thin you almost didn't see it.  No matter, this amazing cheesecake looked gorgeous, didn't crack (seriously, I didn't do anything special), and was devoured at Thanksgiving.  It's not overly pumpkin-y, so the anti-pumpkin spice crowd still enjoyed it.  Make your own graham cracker crust from the recipe on here.  I also made my own pumpkin puree by baking a small sugar pumpkin and then pureeing it.  It may have added a little extra moisture that kept it from cracking, I'm not sure.  I just can't say enough how delicious this turned out.

This pumpkin cheesecake was great!  Made it for my son who is on Keto so I did substitute the regular sugar with Swerve and made a pecan pie crust using the same sweetner.

Used 1 cup pumpkin instead of 1/2 cup which made it a little more dense. I baked it for an additional 3 minutes

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate spices listed in the recipe. This pie is super easy, makes a great presentation and was so delicious! This will be a favorite for sure.

It turned out beautiful I did tweak it a bit though I used three 8 oz cream cheese and I also used the pumpkin pie filling because I was on a budget and I used the mini crusts. I’m so happy with the results

Despite what your better judgment is...don’t let your significant other boil the cream cheese before putting it in the crust.

Made it today, only what I changed is pumpkin mix. I bough whole pumpkin after Halloween, it was on sale 50 cents. So instead of buying a canned pumpkin mix ( found out on the news it's not really a pumpkin mix it's just different zucchini's inside with pumpkin mix seasoning). So I cut pumpkin in half, scrap all the seeds out and bake at 350° cut sides down on baking dish covered in foil for 40 minutes. let it cool. Then I scrap all the pumpkin insides out separate the skin and blend it with hand mixer, ya can use food processor if ya have any. Then I used 1/2 cup of it in this amazing recipe. The rest I just put it in the freezer in plastic bowl for maybe a pumpkin pastry, who knows it yummy dishes. The smell is amazing and used all the baking pumpkin as a substitute for canned pumpkin in this recipe.. also I'll be making my own coconut whipped cream on Thanksgiving to top it on my pumpkin pie. You can find coconut whipped cream on all-time recipes too. This pie is heaven, I took a small bite, my hubby loves it too. This recipe is amazing and easy to make. Will make it again. ??

Great recipe! I added 1/2 cup more cream cheese, 1/3 cup sour cream, 1/4 more pumpkin, and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. I've found these modifications elevate the cheesecake texture and the pumpkin-pie flavor. Both times I made it I got tons of compliments and it really came out beautifully.

I made sure all ingredients were room temperature, mixed until just blended, baked with a water pan beneath the cheesecake, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven with the door slightly open until it cools. This ensured no surface cracking and perfect texture!

Batter was good and smooth and del
This is my first time ever making cheesecake and I love pumpkin cheesecake. It's our first Thanksgiving in our first house and our youngest son's Thanksgiving and the first time we're hosting Thanksgiving, so we're excited! Batter tastes delicious. (No, I'm not tripping off of salmonella...I'll be fine).

Super delicious and tasty! Definitely need to let it refrigerate 24 hours! Could have used 5 more minutes in oven. I also used 3 packets of cream cheese, extra egg, extra sugar and extra spices to taste. Had enough for 2 pies.

I think this is my favorite cheesecake recipe, ever! I upped the ingredients a bit since I had 3 bricks of cream cheese. I added the extra brick of cream cheese, another 1/4 cup of  pumpkin and one extra egg. I made the bottom layer a bit thicker before I added the pumpkin since I had more batter. I also used pumpkin pie spice to taste as I was out of cloves. Thanks so much for the great idea! Everyone loved it!

this is now a tradition for Thanksgiving dinner. I did change it up a little. Graham cracker lined in a spring form pan. then the cream cheese mixture minus a little bit for decorating the top,  then I use pumpkin pie filling carefully not no mess with the layered effect,  I swirl the remaining cream cheese filling on top.  bake 325° for 1 hour and cool in oven overnight.  total awesomeness

Great pie, easy to make and taste delicious. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Made it both ways and found no difference.

I made this layered pumpkin cheesecake and it was SO DELICIOUS! Not difficult to make, but like with any cheesecake, be careful not to over-bake it. You can remove it at the same you would a normal cheesecake.

We LOVE this recipe. My daughter requests it every year for Thanksgiving. Just because it’s easier, we use Libby’s pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin + spices.

So easy! My 16 year old son made it according to the recipe, made no tweaks and it was delicious!  I want to try it again for thanksgiving in a springform pan and use some of the ideas given to enhance the flavor and increase the volume.  I’ll let you know what happens!

This was the first cheesecake I had ever made. They turned out great since they are fool proof. Being put into an already prepared pie crust makes this an easy recipe to make. Plus, they're small and don't require the use of a water bath.

Wow! This recipe is a keeper! I did as an earlier reviewer suggested and mixed 1 cup of cheese mixture with pumpkin puree, and put the remaining cream cheese mixture into a baked Graham  cracker crust (homemade using cinnamon Graham cracker crumbs). I also doubled the pumpkin puree for more pumpkin flavor.  Baked in a water bath and then shut the heat and opened the oven door a crack to let temperature slowly return to room temp. There were no cracks in the top.  The layers displayed beautifully and guests raved about it.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

So I used this recipe and I stead of pumpkin, I baked sweet potatoes and puréed those.  It turned out fantastic.  The longer it sits, the better it gets!  I had to do a trial of it before the holidays so I knew what I was getting into.  In my sweet potato mix, I did add all spice to it, so it’s a whole different flavor profile than o can imagine the pumpkin is.

This is the second year in a row I have made this! This time I’m doing double portions because it ran out so fast last year. The cheesecake is very moist and creamy, and the cloves are not over powering at all. Overall, great recipe!

Great cheesecake! I made it with the bain-Marie method and came out great. Cooked it for an hour. I would just add a little more sugar next time; maybe add a sauce perhaps. Loved the texture and flavor though. I accidently got water on my crust, wrapped it with 3 layers of foil. Don't know if I need a better springform pan.

Look no further. This is it. No changes needed, but take a few minutes to make your own whipped cream. Its so easy and so much better than canned or cool whip. Thanks for uears

I made this in the Instant Pot in a cheesecake pan, it came out beautifully!! I took the advice of the first reviewer and added an extra package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, and extra pumpkin. I saved some of the bottom layer and used a pastry bag to put drops on top, then ran a toothpick through them to make hearts. I covered, then put in the IP for 30 minutes NPR.

This was soo good! This recipe seemed way to easy to taste this good but I love it!  I would definitely let people know it is not a sweet cheesecake. It is a classic taste and it’s awesome! If you want the touch of sweetness the cool whip or rediwhip is a good touch. All in all 10/10!

Made it in a Pyrex pie plate with fresh pumpkin puree from a cooking pumpkin.  Used a cast iron pot with water in it to keep the oven humid.  Very rich, of course.  
The pumpkin layer was nice but I don't think that the plain cheesecake layer did anything for the dessert and I probably wouldn't make it as a double layer cheesecake in the future.  

The cream cheese tends to overwhelm the spicing and I would therefore increase the spices another time.  

Summary:  Double the pumpkin, double (at least) the spices and make as a single layer dessert.

It was easy to make, but we couldn’t keep the pumpkin top layer from bleeding into the cheesecake bottom layer, so you didn’t get the effect we should have.  Plus the pumpkin taste was too strong.  You didn’t get enough cheesecake taste.

I followed suggestions and added a third brick of cream cheese along with some sour cream and a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added a little ginger in with the pumpkin mixture for a little more kick.

Very easy to make. Made one for my coworkers and it was a hit all across. Baked it for an extra 10-15 minutes since it was still very gooey at the suggested time - didn't hinder the recipe at all. Will definitely make it again!

I made this in a 9” spring form with a ginger snap crust and everyone went wild. I used the suggestions of other users, using 3- 8oz  cream cheese, added spiced r upping spices, adding 1/2c sour cream (after the eggs) and baking in a water bath at 350 and propping the oven open for another out. I served with warm caramel and homemade whip cream and it was perfect.

I added a full can 15 oz of pumpkin puree. Also I didn't do two separate layers, just mixed it all together. My family loves it.

I used 3 cream cheeses (8oz), added an extra egg, and more vanilla and sugar. I took out one cup of the plain batter and added it with one cup pumpkin pie filling plus some pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. I then took out a tiny bit of the plain cheesecake batter maybe 1/3 cup and put it into a small ziploc bag. I filled a 10 inch pie crust with the remainder and stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes, then topped gently with the pumpkin batter. I cut the tip of the ziploc and piped circles on top then used a toothpick to drag the batter. Baked for about an hour sitting in a sheet pan of water. Let it cool with the door open and oven off for another hour then stuck it in the fridge for a couple hours.

It was excellent.  I used yogurt for the sour cream and more spices as others suggested.  I made it as a cheesecake in a springform pan and swirled the cup of cheesecake without the spices and pumpkin and it was beautiful.  I will make this again.

Very good. I made this and a pumpkin pie for Christmas dinner and the pumpkin pie did not get touched as this was the big hit! I thought it could use more of a cheesecake taste to it though as well as more spices. Would probably buy the premade pumpkin mix next time. I made the graham cracker crust myself and definitely worth the effort and easy to do.

Turned out great, always make sure the wet ingredients are room temperature or you'll get lumps, I made 2 shallow 8 inch pies with this recipe, put an extra pie pan half filled with water on the second rack to keep the cheese cake from cracking!

I have made this twice and have gotten rave reviews each time.  The only change I made was to use ginger snaps in the crust instead of graham crackers.

This was a decent dessert. It wasn't an actual cheesecake but a "cheesecake like" dessert pie. Still good for not a lot of effort.

Used TRindell recipe to a point.
I made Gluten free double layer cheesecake.

2 1/2- 3 cups Pamela's Gluten Free Graham crackers( you can use any gluten free brand, but these taste the best)
About 9 Tbsp butter (melted).
1/3 cup white sugar, 
1 tsp Cinnamon.
Press mixture into 10inch springfoam pan. Place in freezer until ready to use.

Full big pan with 1 inch water place on bottom rack. (So the water heats up with the oven)
Preheat oven to 350°F

3, 8oz cream cheese blocks (room temperature)
3/4 cup white sugar (heaping)
1 Tbsp vanilla, 
3 Large eggs (beaten in a separate bowl) slowly added to mixture,
1/2 cup sour cream (room temperature, add after the eggs).
Pour 2 cups of batter into springtime pan.
Then mix
1 heaping cup pumpkin puree,
1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice. 
To remaining batter.
Pour into pan.
Beat againt counter to level.
Wrap bottom of  pan with foil so water won't get in.
Place into water bath. 
Bake for 1 hour (maybe and 1 hour and 20ish minutes. I have a fear of things not being done.)

Turn oven off and prop open oven. And cool for 30 minutes/to an hour
Place on counter and cool until pan is cool.
Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
I left mine in all night (about 12hours)
Then I unclipped pan and took cheesecake out.
No cracks!
The cheesecake was delicious! Perfect balace of pumpkin. 
I will definitely make this again. It may even become my holiday staple.

In my time, I've made all sorts of cheesecakes. While looking for something different to serve for dessert at Thanksgiving, I came across this gem of a recipe. Loved it so much, I'm making several for Christmas gifts tonight. The only thing I'm going to do different is add more plain cheesecake batter and more spice to the pumpkin. Otherwise, this is the best and easiest cheesecake out there. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit.  I did use fresh pumpkin instead of the canned pumpkin puree. Since I discovered how easy it is to use fresh pie pumpkin I have found that it does taste better than the canned pumpkin.  Other than that I followed the recipe precisely and was begged to make it again for Christmas.

I use this same recipe minus the pumpkin and spices when I want to make the original version. It's fluffy, lite with just the right amount enough sweetness. I added a 1/2 of sour cream as suggested  and let me tell you it makes a world of difference.  I love to add a cherry sauce on top to make it the perfect dessert.

I used cinnamon graham crackers to make my own crust.  I would recommend that you not use the cinnamon grahams - it did not compliment what would have been a great pie.

I make this every year and it's a favorite even with people who don't like pumpkin pie, but I did make changes based on others' suggestions.  3 (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese, stir in a 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 (8 oz) can of pumpkin puree,  1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, slightly more sugar, but not 3/4 cup, then I doubled (or tripled depending on the taste) of the ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg. I didn't have cloves so I used ground pumpkin pie spice. I baked it in a water bath about 1 hour in the oven, then opened the over door and let it cool for an hour. No cracks!  I made my own crust of 1 1/2 cup of gingersnap cookies, 3/4 cup hazelnuts (all ground up in processes), 3 tbsp of brown sugar, 6 tbsp of melted butter and pressed the mixture into the bottom and side of the pan (greased and floured).

Way better than I would have ever imagined. Great recipe!!! Easy to make a super duper hit at Thanksgiving. Give your pumpkin pie some oomph by adding cheesecake. Tastes like a specialty dessert from a high class restaurant. Definitely will make this one again.

I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan but I love cheesecake and thought this would satisfy everyone as a perfect Thanksgiving dessert! I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the nutmeg (it's actually toxic, look it up!) and I had to cook it an additional 10 minutes. It was absolutely delicious!! So easy to make and so so good. I have to say, the leftover pie tasted even better after being in the fridge another day or two. It's the perfect fall dessert and the perfect balance between cheesecake and pumpkin pie flavors. I will definitely make this one again.

I’m not a baker or cooker. I always come to this site to look for something to make. This was such a big hit for me.  So easy to make and the only thing I changed was i used the pumpkin filling and added extra cinnamon. Delicious!  I’m making this again.

Made twice. One dry run, which came out excellent. The second one I brought to my "sister-in-law's" Thanksgiving. Will definitely make again! Only omitted the whip cream.

This was a hit on Thanksgiving, especially with the kids who ignored the brownies I also made.

Amazing dish! I was skeptical about exchanging my traditional pumpkin pie for this, but decided I wanted to try something different this year and I was so glad that I did. Well worth it! I doubled the recipe to make two pies and added a little less nutmeg, as I am not overly fond of it and it turned out perfectly. New tradition? I think so!

Meh. This really didn't do it for me or my family. It's a dessert with a personality disorder -- it's not really a cheesecake and it's not really a pie. It doesn't know what it wants to be and winds up being mediocre. There's about as much pumpkin flavor as if you'd just waved the pumpkin can over the mixing bowl, but not added any. I nearly doubled the amount of pumpkin and it was still hugely disappointing. Not a keeper if a pumpkin dessert is the goal.

Wow, totally incredible. My whole family absolutely loved this, said it was the best they had ever tasted, even better than the cheesecake factories.

This was surprisingly sweet for only half a cup of sugar.  I think I'll use a third of a cup next time.  This recipe is nice and easy to put together, however I feel like the bake time is wrong.  Mine took 15 additional minutes, for a total time of 1hr at 325.  I actually had to throw away the first pie I made because it was too undercooked.   But aside from it being a touch too sweet and needing longer to bake this is a good pie that everyone loved at Thanksgiving dinner.  I will make it again, only tweaked.

I’ve made this many times as instructed with total success and this now followed Bonniejoe, what a mistake. Quadrupled the foil on the pan. Cooked as she suggested minus the sour cream because I forgot, pulled out a mush mess. I will never tweak the original recipe

For ease (because I was asked to make desserts 30 hours before the event) I used leftover sugar pumpkin and added a little sweet potato to make the full amount. I also did not bother to layer the pie as I didn't have time to fiddle with it.  Baked as written in a GF cracker crust and after 45 minutes the pie and the filling sample were still goopy. As I was raising the temp for the next dessert to 400 already, I popped both back in for 15 more minutes as the temp raised. Perfect! As the pie fell with overnight refrigeration, it gained a more cheesecake like texture over an airy souffle. Both were great. I'd serve this hot OR cold.

I made this cheesecake last year for thanksgiving and it blew my family away.  I don't think I added the cloves though.  Only thing is it was a little softer in the middle so it took a very...very long time to settle.  I intend to bake this longer this time.  I will change my review after this one.  I was told to bake it until it cracks?  Hm.  I'll try that.

made 2 cheese cakes with a 9" and 10" cheesecake tin. tripped all of the ingredients except for the sugar inside the cream cheese mix and I loved it!

make sure you wrap the pan with foil and cook them in a bath! this prevents the crust  from getting to hard

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I did make my own graham cracker crust instead of the premade kind. Also, I did a water bath to bake it in and left it in the oven after baking with oven turned off.  Everyone loved this definitely a keeper.

As with anything pumpkin, I added a dash of allspice and some ginger for kick.  This was super easy and tasted amazing.  Highly recommend

We all loved this! Followed the recipe but added extra vanilla (1Tbsp.), used pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices ( probably 2tsp., didn’t measure it), and used whip cream in a can instead of whipped topping. It was easy to make, was pretty with the two separate layers and delicious! Mahalo for a great recipe!

This Pie was just Cream cheese and sugar plus a layer of pumpkin flavored cream cheese and sugar. Disgustingly overloaded. It was an easy cake to make and came out awesome looked delicious but you will get Diabetes eating this

Really lovely flavour. I made mine in a 9” springform but would recommend a 10”. It baked for 45 mins then I turned the oven off, left the door ajar and cooled it before chilling.

I doubled the filling and added 1 heaping c. Pumpkin purée and 2 tsp. Pumpkin pie spice. I did a ginger snap crust. Will post a pic.

Used a 9” springform pan and baked about 55 mins before it was jiggly but kind of a stiff jiggle. Let it rest and the doneness was perfect. I used about 1/8 tsp of the clove and nutmeg and made sure not to whip air into the filling. The pumpkin flavor did not dominate the cheesecake and the texture is definitely cheesecake. My 2 yr old couldn’t get enough! While I would have preferred a thicker filling because it was so good, I think the 1” thickness worked out well.

I have made this a few times now and love it. I end up doubling the recipe and using a whole can of the pumpkin, it will actually make 3 pies that way. If you don’t want to double, I still recommend adding way more pumpkin. It adds so much flavour

Easy to make and delicious! My store didn’t have the premade crust so I bought raw crust and cooked the pie by the recipe. It turned out great, I would recommend this recipe.

I don’t like pumpkin, however I have made this pie every Thanksgiving for the past five years, and the family loves it.  I even make one for my coworker, and her kids love it so much, they fight over it.

My family requests this every Thanksgiving, that says a lot. I did it exactly as the recipe said, and everyone loved it. I made it again tonight with homemade blueberry sauce in place of pumpkin puree, and people just love it. Minus the pumpkins spices too of course.

Oh my! I saved this recipe awhile ago and just made it today. This was delicious! Everyone loved it! I prefer this over a pumpkin pie, and I do like both. I used almost the entire 15oz can of pumpkin purée. I didn’t have cloves or nutmeg but I did have pumpkin spice. So I used that instead. I also didn’t measure the cinnamon but know I added more than the recipe called for. Thank you so much! I first tried pumpkin cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory and was sad to learn it was seasonal. I don’t need them anymore. ..

I used this recipe in a cooking lesson for my grandkids.  They wanted to make a cheesecake and I had several cans of pumpkin in the pantry, so this recipe fit the bill.  They made the recipe exactly as stated.  We chilled it overnight and had it for dessert the next day.  Everyone was amazed at how good it is.  It really is like something you might get in a restaurant.  This is a recipe that we will make again.

This is one of the best pumpkin cheesecake recipes I have found anywhere!  My wife does not like cheesecake in general but loves this.  The one major change we made was to use crushed ginger snaps for the crust instead of the normal graham cracker crust.  I highly recommend it!

I made this a couple of days ago. I was using up some of the pumpkin puree that I had frozen. Followed the recipe and the result was delicious with no changes. Will be making again for sure. Thank you for a lovely desert.

I'm not a recipe follower.  They are guidelines for me.  I changed the crust to ginger snap and pecan, but everything else is mostly the same.  I did use a bigger can of pumpkin pie mix and had to bake about 20-30 minutes longer.  All in all it was a hit for Christmas desert.  Thanks for the idea.

This was so Creamy and rich! A great pie to share with friends.  I wanted to fill my deep ceramic pie plate so I changed the amount of all ingredients as if I was making 1&1/2 pies so it would fill the plate. I baked for the same time and it was as perfect.

Delicious! So good I made it for Christmas (night before) then I made another one (again a day in advance) to bring up to my mom-in-laws. I followed others instructions and added 1.5 cups of cream cheese mixture with 1 tsp of vanilla (3 bricks total) at the bottom, then used 1 cup of pumpkin with more of all spices. I used a spring form 9” pan, baked for one hour at 325 and left in oven until cool. Still cracked a but was perfectly cooked. Left overnight in the fridge and it was restaurant quality the next day when served (as per my family) Yum! :)

This cheesecake is really good. It’s creamy, and the baker controls the pumpki-ness and spices by using puree instead of the pie mix. I live in GB, so I made some alterations for convenience. I used digestive biscuits, which are similar to graham crackers, and I used the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe on allrecipes for the crust. The cream cheese comes in 300g tubs, so I used a total of about 20oz of cream cheese and three eggs (they weren’t very big) for the filling. I measured out 1/2 c of pumpkin puree, considered using more and decided against it. DH thought it was less-pumpkin-y than the first time I made the recipe and liked the flavor better. Also, I don’t have ground cloves, so I use garam masala whenever ground cloves are called for. I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas. It’s a keeper recipe.

This recipe has been a major hit with my family and the inlaws during Thanksgiving and Christmas for years. Some of my inlaws won't eat pumpkin anything and love this! My mother in law was so jazzed that this dish will be at the table this year! Easy, tasty, and a crowd pleaser!

Yep, it's good! Huge hit with everyone I know. 
I also make a topping of 8oz Cream Cheese, 1 Cup Vanilla Yogert, 1/2 Cup Sugar, and 1/8 cup milk (blend liquids in slowly) - Whipped.

Followed the recipe exactly. Everyone enjoyed it as there was not a piece left. Not overly sweet as some cheesecakes can be. I will be making this for Thanksgiving from here on.

Cheesecake is cheesecake, so I rated it 3 stars as it was still "good"; however, it didn't layer like I expected. Instead, the pumpkin part made the underlying cheesecake part a bit splotchy. I will probably make it again, but play around with the thickness/consistency of the layers. I made my GF, so was able to offer it to others with food allergies! :)

Loved it! very easy recipe and quick too! Dangerously delicious! I cheated and used a pre-made graham cracker crust, but it was still delicious! She was right in the video when she said, "you may never want to separate these two pies again!"

ACCIDENTALLY added half the amount of sugar and it was still perfect. Maybe even more pleasing to some!


(I like spice so I doubled it that part, did the water in pan trick and the top was flawless. Added 20 minutes to the baking time. AMAZING! This is a keeper!!!)

Turned out very good.  I used about 1-1/2 cups of cheesecake batter for the bottom layer.  I made one cheesecake in a 9 inch pan and another in an 8 inch pan.  For this amount of batter, I liked the thickness (1-1/2") of the 8 inch pan better.  In my opinion the 1" thickness in the 9 inch pan was too thin.

This cheesecake is so good. I use the exact same ingredients, but I swap the layers just because I prefer the white on top. Everyone who has it loves it. I've been told that I should sell it and the word "phenomenal" has been used more than once!

This is my new favorite holiday pie recipe! It still gives me the traditional pumpkin flavor but it is enhanced with the luxuriousness of cream cheese. It's totally irresistible! Super easy to make and incredibly satisfying. Everyone wants to take a piece home so I always make two pies to be sure I get to keep some too!

Turned out perfectly.  I made my own crust using a recipe on this site....didn't measure ~used a pack of graham crackers as reader suggested.  I also refrigerated the bottom section for a few minutes while preparing the top mixture.  I did not take a picture.

I have made this twice--the first time, exactly to the written recipe (I decided this needed modification); the second time was absolutely wonderful.  What I changed--3 8oz packages of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of sugar (I used Stevia), 3 eggs added in one at a time, and a teaspoon of vanilla, beat throughly.  Put approximately one cup each of this mixture into 2, 9 inch, pre-made graham cracker pic crusts.  Then add one 16 oz can of pumpkin puree + spices, and mix again.  Divide this into 2 equal parts, and top the pies with this mixture.  Bake as instructed.  This method made a much firmer pie, more like a New York Cheesecake.

I made this exactly as written, grating my nutmeg from a nut, and taking the berries from the top of whole cloves and grinding it myself using a mortar and pestle. Using these totally fresh spices might be why this is MOST DELICIOUS pumpkin cheesecake I have ever tasted. My neighbors want me to make some for them (and pay me for them) so I just printed the recipe and gave them that instead. This is SO EASY to make, and so impressive. This is the best recipe I've tried from this site, and believe me I've made a lot.

So, I saw this recipe and wanted to try it for the guests I was having over tonight. I had all the ingredients but no time. I had 45 min til I needed to leave the house. No graham crackers or graham cracker crust, so I quick-smashed a bunch of vanilla wafers, melted some butter and mixed it in the pie pan, not nearly enough butter but kinda shaped it into a crust. Speedily mixed up everything else and somehow managed to get in in the oven in 13 minutes. Had to pull it out right at 30 min in the oven and threw it straight into the fridge. Pulled it out to eat (without whipped topping) about 7 hours later and it was perfect! Maybe a tad bit softer than it should have been, but it tasted amazing!!!! This recipe is so forgiving. Still can't believe how quickly it pulled together! Only suggestion is to add a bit more pumpkin. SO delicious!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! I used crushed gingerbread cookies for the crust. I don't like  gingerbread cookies, but I loved this crust.

I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe. The second time I used 2tsp vanilla instead of just 1/2 tsp. I also used the pumpkin pie flavored pumpkin instead of the puree, and my family preferred that. It was wonderful and even the small children loved it. For now this is my "go to" pumpkin dessert.

This went down well in my house for thanksgiving. I increased the amount of cream cheese used in the recipe to give it a creamer texture, And I think next time I will add more because I wasn't super keen on the texture of the pumpkin layer. I made it with a digestive biscuit base as is traditional for an English cheesecake, and I topped it with caramel. Got great reviews so I will make it again. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star and not 5 is because of the texture.

Loved the taste of this and it’s quick and easy to make. The only issue was that it came out too soft! Not sure if it should have been cooked for longer. I didn’t know what it meant “until the centre is set.” Can anyone recommend how to make this more firm so I can make it again for Christmas?

This was excellent. However, if you live at high-altitude, this will not be done in 30 minutes. I turned up the heat to 375, and cooked for nearly double the time.

I only had a premade chocolate gram cracker crust I wanted to use up. I normally make my own.  Also I had some left over  regular gram crackers and enough cheese cake batter so I made a small cheese cake as well in a small pyrex  dish.  I liked it a lot but I would have added more pumpkin puree for more pumpkin flavor.  I did like the chocolate crust better  as well so try it.

I made this for the second time yesterday. It's a great recipe that needs minimal changes. I made my own crust using a recipe from this site, fresh pumpkin purée, a little less than 1/2 cup sugar and a rounded 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice since I was out of the individual spices.  I prefer it without whip cream and bake it a little longer. No water bath or anything special needed.

This was perfect! All the extra effort me and my husband put into this was worth it! My kids loved it, and when they left to bed me and my husband eat the rest. It wasn't too rich or sweet, it was perfectly designed.

This is an awesome recipe! One step I added was to stick the pie into the freezer after the first layer, until just firm to help create an even layer and easily spread the pumpkin layer. I also added a bit more vanilla and a bit of ground ginger. The first time I made it the crust was a little crisp, so the second attempt I placed it in a shallow pan with a hot water bath. Even better result. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

This tasted pretty good, but unfortunately for some reason I was the only one that ate it for Thanksgiving.  Everyone else preferred the classic pumpkin pie.  The only thing wrong was that the cream cheese would not smooth out with the mixer.  There were little chunks of cheese throughout, which made it a little less attractive.

I made this and it was my first time making a cheesecake. I love cheesecake it's my fav dessert so I believe I know a good one when I taste it. I changed a few things I used 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup pumpkin purée, 1tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp apple pie spice. It was delicious and not too sweet I had an extra 2oz of cream cheese as well. Smooth creamy and no cracks. I would definitely make again. Everyone in my family ate 2nds and 3rds there was no cheesecake left.

Came out perfect, will make this often! Thanks for the great recipe!
Oh, I did not want to save any leftover pumpkin, so mixed up the whole can in the top layer,  with extra spices. Had to fill a ramekin with the extra, so the pie did not overflow. That was a sweet little extra!

I've made this about 5 times and it's always such a hit. People love it even more than regular pumpkin pie. I always make my own crust and add closer to 3/4 or 1 cup of pumpkin. Delicious!

This is easy to make and delicious!  I added a streusel topping (brown sugar/pecans/butter) and also changed the crust to a vanilla wafer because I don't care for graham cracker crust.  This was the HIT of our Turkey Day meal!  I will make this every year!

Superb! Used the original recipe x 1.5 and the larger Keebler graham cracker crust.  Put more of the cream cheese in the bottom before adding the pumpkin as others suggested. Used a whole can of pumpkin purée and it turned out perfect!

Great option for the traditional pumpkin pie.  I made both, and this one went first.  I will be adding it to our Thanksgiving menu from now on.  Thanks!

I made my crust, instead of a store bought one. A delicious light flavored pumpkin delight. Definitely make this one again.

Yum!! Used 2.5 packages of Greek yogurt-style cream cheese (had 1/2 package left over from another recipe), added about 1/2 cup sour cream after the eggs, and this gave me enough filling to have 1.5 cups of vanilla filling in the bottom of the graham cracker pie crust. Then, after it was all assembled, the key was to cook the pie at 325 deg F for about 40 minutes, or until the temperature of the filling was 150 degrees (measured on a digital thermometer in the middle of the pie).

We really enjoyed this pie!  Not a fan of plain pumpkin pie but this is a winner!  Even cooked a neck pumpkin to make it as homemade as I could.  Will make again.

I actually ah a couple of issues with this pie, although it was well received. I found the cheesecake to be somewhat dry, and the pumpkin a bit overpowering. My only change was to make an oreo cookie crust, as i like the combo of pumpkin & chocolate.  Worth a try, but some adjustments may be needed based on your particular tastes. I would probably not make this again.

I made it exactly to the recipe. I will definitely make it again. I would suggest adding a little more of the spices as it could use a bit more flavor, but  I made 2  and they were inhaled. Easy to make, and delicious.

Made this for thanksgiving. Easy to make! I do think I will try a homemade graham cracker crust next time, but the packaged time does save time. I appreciated it didn't need to be baked in a water bath but didn't crack on top.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving (2016) & it was a huge hit!  Absolutely delicious...the cheesecake was light (which was great following a heavy dinner) and the pumpkin flavors shined through!
After reading a number of reviews prior to cooking, I ended up adding  more than the 1/2 cup of pumpkin purée...using closer to a cup....I also used a heavy amount of Pumpkin Spice mix along with cinnamon. The overall taste was more Pumkin Pie than Cheesecake...simply divine!
[I also garnished the top with a dollop of whip cream, from a can..and then a sprinkle of cinnamon on top of the cream.]
Have a feeling I'll be asked to make this recipe again, and again, and again :)

Good alternative for those of us that don't like traditional pumpkin pie. I would suggest a bit more sugar & a bit more of the cheesecake on the bottom before adding the pumpkin. Maybe 1/4 cup more sugar & 1/2 cup more filling for the bottom

Absolutely the BEST double layer pumpkin pie cheesecake I've ever made! This is my favorite holiday desert and I thought the recipe I used before was good, but this one was even better! It's thick, rich, creamy and you'll melt with every single bite!

To the person who left one star. Sorry but you simply do not know how to bake!! If you make this correctly it is a smash. Always the favorite dessert where ever I bring it or serve it and I been making this for years now. I do add one teaspoon of vanilla, but always add more vanilla in all baking recipes, and TS of cinnamon and a little more of the nutmeg as well. A smash hit. So again anyone who gave this a bad rating you simply are doing something completely wrong. And if you can not make this simple recipe and get 5 star raves for years like I have you need to give up baking all together. It is really good with some caramel poured on top with cool whip. Makes it even better served that way and served ice cold. :)

I love making this recipe with homemade graham cracker crust. Lately, I have been making Pumpkin CheeseCUPcakes instead of pies. They are always a hit and easier to distribute :) One pie makes about 24-26 cupcakes.

I subbed in dairy free cream cheese and it turned out well. It's now my go-to Thanksgiving dessert.

I made this last month and my husband and his family LOVED it.  So much that I've been asked to make it again for thanksgiving dinner.  I like it because it's pleasantly mild; not too sweet (only 1/2 cup sugar!), not too spiced...just perfect.  Also, so simple to make.

It was pretty good.  I doubled the amount of pumpkin because I like pumpkin flavor. It filled an extra large Keebler pie crust to the brim. The cheesecake part was delish. I would make this again.

Followed the recipe to a T and it tasted good! It was so easy to make too.  Next time I'll add more "pumpkin spice" to up the flavour. This recipe is not too sweet, which I prefer.

This recipe is a keeper!  I can't eat sugar, so I substituted 3/8 cup agave and it tastes great.  I also used duck eggs instead of chicken eggs.  It is so light and fluffy. I am at 4000 feet altitude, so I baked it for an additional ten minutes.

This is a very easy recipe! Everyone always loves it!!! I just saved a little bit of the cheesecake filling to make a really nice design on the top of the pumpkin, by placing a line or two at least 1 inch apart, then used a butter knife to draw lines horizontally across the white cheesecake lines to create a very pretty pie.

Very disappointing. The cheese part overwhelms the other flavors and it feels like you are just eating cream cheese straight out of the package. I don't know if the amount of cream cheese is too high, the sugar too low or not enough pumpkin but it's kind of bittersweet. My coworkers didn't like it.

This was delicious! I made my own graham cracker crust, and used real whipping cream in place of a tub of frozen whipped topping.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a definite hit! Thanks Stephanie for a fabulous recipe!

I was worried after reading posts about using springforms, potential cracking, making a bunch of adjustments. I made mine per recipe for most part. I used shortbread premade crust. Okay, I used pumpkin purée and threw in a dollop extra. Okay, I also threw in a pinch more cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg but I couldn't taste a big difference from original purée mix. I

This cheesecake turned out really well and was a huge hit. I personally thought it needed a bit more flavor so I would suggest that you double the cinnamon and add extra nutmeg and cloves. Other than that the texture and everything was perfect. I would make it again for sure with that minor adjustment.

marvellous. i used the pecan crust recipe from allrecipes.com, instead of gingersnaps. i also used a real (mini) pumpkin; cut it in half, cleaned the seeds and strings and put in the oven for 15-20 mins in 400 degrees. all homemade and delicious.

Delicious! I'm not a huge plain pumpkin pie fan, but I do love any flavor of cheesecake and this one is perfect for fall. I have made it several times and it has been requested by family a few times. I am now really into using my pressure cooker and it makes cheesecakes so easy and they cook perfectly even. I use a Pyrex 7 cup dish and cook it on high in my pressure cooker for 25 minutes and then let it sit for 10 minutes to let the pressure release  before I take the cover off. Super fast and easy!
For the crust I just use 5 graham crackers, 1 tbsp of sugar, and 3 tbsp of melted butter.

Family requests this every year. I have been making it as per the recipe every year.  I usually roast and make purée from a fresh pie pumpkin and freeze to make the usual pies and cheesecakes for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This year will be the first using a pumpkin grown in the garden.

This was an easy recipe to use and it was absolutely delicious. It was gone, then people said, "I guess I'll have some pumpkin pie". I did cook it longer though as I used fresh made pumpkin from my garden.

Looked at some of the suggestion before making. Used 3 packages cream cheese, 3 eggs and the 1/2cup sour cream.

This is such a great idea. I did change it a bit since I have another recipe I use alwas for cheesecake. 3 packs cream cheese. 1 can condensed milk...3 eggs.  I used 1 cup of pumpkin and spiced it myself. I wanted it with a little more pumpkin flavor. When I added it to the cheesecake batter...omg...explosion in my mouth. It was divine. Thank you for this recipe...God willing I will use it at Thanksgiving.

Really Good! I did do some modifications such as using a whole 15oz. can of pumpkin; pinch of ginger; tsp. pumpkin pie spice as well as the listed spices according to the recipe. 2 1/2 bricks cream cheese and rest according to directions. I didn't 'blend in' the pumpkin; I used the mixer. Came out with a MUCH thicker consistency so, naturally I was worried it wouldn't turn out. Baked for 50 mins.; let rest in oven; cooled on wire rack; refrigerated overnight & voila! it came out great. Not too sweet, good consistency. I'm glad I used the whole 15 oz. can because the cream cheese seemed to overtake. I tend to cook/bake according to taste. My family like it & their tough ;)

I have made this pie many times over the last several years.  I usually make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is very tasty and different from the regular pumpkin pie.

I made this using the suggestions for one review since I was using a springform pan.  I used 2 cups of the cream cheese mixture in bottom of pan.  I should have put some in another 8 inch pie pan.  There was more than enough filling to fill a spring form pan and the 8 inch pie pan.  Great recipe.

I made this the first time exactly as written. we all loved it. So quick and easy. 2nd x I used the pie filling as some was accidentally bought and opened and I wanted to use it up. Great again. 3rd time I couldn't find a recipe to use up some very over ripe bananas so instead of pumpkin, used 2 over ripe bananas, changed the vanilla to almond and maple, added some cinnamon and gently swirled in some melted peanut butter careful not to go too deep so the bottom layer didn't get mixed in...OMG what a fantastic and versatile easy cheesecake recipe. They all turned out amazing and were gone before I could say "want a piece of..."

This is a great recipe! I turned this into individual cheesecakes by dividing everything into muffin tins. (I made a graham cracker crust also from this website) and baked them for 25 minutes. The only thing I added to the recipe was a squeeze of lemon into the cheesecake batter (before dividing and adding the pumpkin and spices).  The flavor was amazing and my family loved them! I will definitely be making these again!

Absolutely fabulous. I had been looking for an easy pumpkin cheesecake and this one fit the bill since it only used 16oz of cream cheese. I threw in extra pumpkin and and spices for more flavor and it really worked out well.

Whenever a dessert has more than one layer, people are impressed instantly. With a couple of ingredients and a few steps, you can create a very delicious pumpkin cheesecake pie with... Not one, but TWO layers!

This was a tasty cheesecake and very easy.  I followed TRindle's advice and made it in a 9x13 pan, doubling the filling.  Don't repeat my mistake: I misread TRindle's use of waxed paper thinking "yeah, I can just lift the whole thing out of the pan if I line it with waxed paper first".  It did not lift out, and now I know that TRindle meant to say to use the waxed paper to press down the crust.  At any rate, this was a delicious cheesecake and I made the batter just as listed.

Hmmm... not sure what I did wrong, but the 9" pie crust was way too big for the ingredients -- the layers were very thin. The taste was fine but if I made it again I would double the pumpkin layer ingredients and add some sugar. Also had to bake it for a lot longer than the recipe says at 325.

The reviews were overwhelming. I stuck to the original recipe without making any changes and this cheesecake lasted 10 minutes after dinner. I did need to bake it for an extra 20 minutes though. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake! Served chilled with whip cream

Let me start off by saying that taste wise, this recipe is 5 stars. The recipe instruction really needs to be clarified. This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, so I followed the recipe exactly, even buying the expensive spices separately instead of using pumpkin pie spice like other reviewers stated they've used. I placed it in the middle rack of the oven for 40 mins, and it was not nearly enough. it looked watery and way too jiggly, so I kept it in for 20 more mins. I let it cool then put it in the fridge overnight, and it turned out fine, no problem with cracks or anything. Will definitely make again!

AAAAHHHH-MAZING! My first homemade pumpkin pie / cheesecake! I made this for a Thanksgiving birthday cake and everyone loved it. There were absolutely no left-overs.  I took many reviewer's changes into account.  Used 3 packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 3/4 cup Pumpkin Pie Mix.  I preferred a more cheesecake taste so that's why I added more cheese and less pumpkin.  It was not too pumpkin-y nor too rich. Just perfect! I also made a delicious caramel topping which was a great addition! I would definitely recommend drizzling caramel over the top rather than a whipped cream topping. Will be making again and again!

Amazing! I made this for the first after never having pumpkin cheese before but hearing about it at work. It sounded good so I found this recipe and it's great! My crust didn't turn out the best but that one was my fault (misjudged my butter amount). I plan to make another one of these for the family for Christmas. No cracking or anything! It did end up taking slightly longer to cook for me though.

I really liked the recipe! I agree with a lot of the other reviews, you should buy  pumpkin pie filling. I was a bit disappointed because I usually make really good desserts and the filling I made didn't meet my personal standards. Despite that, everyone I made it for loved it! There was leftover cheesecake filling but I just ended up making a cheesecake and this. I really really liked it at the end of it all. Would totally make again!

Everyone I made this for LOVED it! Took notes from other reviews: upped sugar to 1 cup, vanilla to 1 tsp, pumpkin puree to 8 oz, cinnamon to 1 tsp, nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. Used 1 pkg of normal cream cheese and 1 pkg of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and texture still was fine. Family said they were a fan because it was lighter than normal cheesecake, not too sweet even with added sugar, and could taste the pumpkin flavor. Baked it for 50 minutes (had small cracks at the top)

Definitely will be my go-to contribution for anything n autumn because of how quick and easy it is to make.

i changed the amounts a little but nothing to drastic so I assume its pretty much how its to taste.
 I used three packages of cream cheese and upped the sugar to 1 cup and the pumpkin to 3/4 cup and a touch more vanilla.  then I used pumpkin pie spice with a little bit of added cinnamon and sprinkled cinnamon on top before cooking. It made a large full pie and it tasted great!  topped with homemade whipped cream. I will make this from now on.

Tastes better than these $30 double layer pumpkin cheesecakes that go like hotcakes every fall at a farmer's market in NY.  Now I can make it myself!  Prior to making this recipe, I only made cupcakes out of a box for my kids' birthdays.  I read about 60 reviews and incorporated a few repeated tips that resulted in a tasty masterpiece.  I kept the recipe exactly as printed with the following tweaks: (1) to the 16 oz of cream cheese I added a half cup of whipped cream cheese (all I had in fridge); (2) I added larger quantities of flavor, i.e.,  2/3 TB of vanilla extract, 2/3 cup pumpkin purée, 2/3 tsp cinnamon, 2/3 cup sugar.  It was a hit at dessert time on Turkey Day.  My days of trekking to the faraway farmer's market for a $30 9-inch pumpkin cheesecake are over! Incredible recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and I will definitely be making it again next Thanksgiving. The only change I made was to add 1/3 cup sour cream, this makes the mix extra silky! I also made my own crust using 1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers, 6TBS melted butter, and just a sprinkle of the pumpkin pie spices; really pulled it all together!

Loved it!  So did the whole fam, young to old.  The changes I made, and want to remember, are as follow:  after placing the pre-pumpkin batter over the graham crust in spring form pan, I added an additional egg, as well as one-half cup heavy whipping cream in addition to the pumpkin.  I blended the mixture on high, longer than I would have without the cream, until soft peaks formed.  At that time, I poured it over the other mixture.  Baking took an additional 20 minutes past the time in the recipe, until the middle was nearly set... nonetheless, the result was beautiful, with zero cracking.

I was pleasantly surprised by how great this turned out. Much more like a cheesecake than a pie. I made the following adjustments: 2 and 1/2 packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, a heaping cup of pumpkin, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I made my own graham cracker crust in a deep dish pie plate. I put a scant 2 cups of the cream cheese mixture in the first layer and mixed the pumpkin with the remaining mixture for the top layer. It took at least an hour to bake. I took it out when it was just a little jiggly in the middle but firm on the edges. It did crack but I don't really mind that. Delicious!

It was pretty straightforward.  I used regular cream cheese and not low fat.  I didn't think it was sweet enough.  I thought it was just OK.  I would add more sugar and maybe a bit more spice.

Love, Love, Love this! So easy and delicious. I did leave it in the oven for an hour, and added a little more nutmeg (only because I love the flavor).

This has become a Thanksgiving staple. It's great for people who like something pumpkin but don't want pie. The proportion of the two layers are perfect.

This is a really good and easy recipe. I made the crust from one of the other recipes here and it went very well with this pumpkin dessert. My advice---DO NOT BUY THE ALLSPICE pumpkin!!

Use each one of the spices it asks for individually!! It makes such a difference. That pumpkin all spice stuff is not very good. I made one with and one without. NOBODY liked the allspice one. Said it tasted fake.

That's the beauty of working with spices. 

Anyways--I am not a fan of pumpkin but I did try this and it was yummy!!! Not too cheesecakey-not too pumpkiny. 
A good balance of both.

We really liked this pie/cake. Don't think that I'll be putting whipped cream on top, it was half gone as soon as it was cool enough. Only changes were 1 tsp of vanilla and used pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices.

I love this recipe. I make it just as the recipe calls, or, just use pumpkin pie spice instead of all the other spices. Either way, it's delicious. My husband and daughter say they wait all year for it!

Perfection!   I tried this one and loved it! Only thing is I always find myself doubting the cheesecake to pumpkin ratio, I'll have too much mix leftover and am too afraid to fill the pan to the top.  I just set it aside or use the extra in a small French onion bowl to bake a separate mini pie.  Regardless in the end the pie always turns out great.

I was rather unimpressed with this pie. I was really disappointed after all of the great reviews. It just felt like something was missing. I followed the directions exactly and it came out nice and moist but it just needs a little more spice to it or something. I probably won't be making this again, there are so many other more flavorful pumpkin dessert recipes out there.

The taste was amazing . I was a little disappointed that the bottom layer of regular cheese cake was much thinner than the top layer of pumpkin. When I make it again, I will probably increase the amount from 1 cup to 1.5-2cups.  That way the layers will be even. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was reading the comments while it was in the oven and got a little worried since I saw a lot of people saying it needed changes. It didn't. It was amazing. I left it in for about 40-45 mins because it was still a little jiggly then let it cool for about an hour and refrigerate over night. It was better than pumpkin pie but tasted almost just like it. It was more rich but not too sweet. Must try.

Made it for the fam... They don't all like pumpkin, but they ALL love this when I make it. Tastes much better with homemade pumpkin puree, but that's just my opinion - I added pumpkin pie spice to give it more pumpkin pie taste.

I accidentally forgot to mix the egg with the bottom layer and instead just mixed one egg with the top layer and it came out amazing. Next time though I will make sure to do it right.

While this was good, it wasn't pumpkin-y enough.  I tasted the spices more than the pumpkin.

Love it! Very light and creamy. If you don't like pumpkin too much, maybe a little less pumpkin layer. Overall, great recipe! Super easy!

Delicious! I used low fat cream cheese for a slightly lighter version and I skipped out on the whipped cream. I also added about 2 tbsp of plain yogurt to add a bit of creaminess though I'm not sure if it actually helped. I doubled the cinnamon because I like a bit more spice. Definitely will be making this again and next time I will drizzle a little caramel on top as another user suggested.

The only change I made was per a previous review, set the 1/2 cup pumpkin puree with one cup batter aside and put the remaining batter in the bottom of crust (for white layer). Came out great.

Made this recipe using 12 serving adjustments instead of the 8. I did add sour cream after the eggs, but other than that didn't change anything else. This was a tasty cream cheese dish.

AMAZING!!! I actually halved the recipe, not to change the recipe but because I only had 1 pack of cream cheese. I loved it! I think all of the negative comments are from people lacking common sense if you want it tasting more or less like pumpkin then adjust it to your liking! that simple!. I left it in the oven for a bit longer than suggested, and added more sugar to the pumpkin mixture. Fabulous recipe!! Thanks from New Zealand :)

Everyone loved it! I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it just didn't have as string of pumpkin flavor as I would like. So with that said, after reading the reviews, I will make again and add a full cup and see if that will work. Otherwise it was fast and tasty. Also, the hubs LOVES nilla wafers so I made a nillacrust instead of store bought cardboard gram crust. Sublime!!!

I followed what others suggested and used 3 packages of cream cheese and put extra pumpkin in. I made a gingersnap crust and used a springform pan. I did have to cook closer to an hour and let rest with oven door open. Made a caramel sauce to go on top. Absolutely AWESOME! This one went in the family cookbook to be saved.

Great recipe. Came here to share a tip that can be used with all cheesecakes--

Bake one cheesecake at a time, on the middle rack, and put a shallow glass dish 1/3 full of water on the rack below it.
Superfats the 'skim' layer with water and keeps your cheesecake from cracking during the last 10 minute and during the refrigeration process. Refrigeration removes moisture from the air, and that's the cause of the infernal perfect cheesecake cracking.

I've made cheesecake before and so after reading all the reviews, I went for the adjustments to get more pumpkin flavor and cheesecake texture. The result was perfection on the first try! I used a regular cake pan and it still worked out fine. (first slice a little tricky though). Check out my crack free cheesecake photo with a slice in front. I piped homemade whipped cream and sprinkled cinnamon on top. It looked amazing. PS. I did use almost all organic ingredients just because I prefer it. Here's what I did...

Followed recipe basics, yes I used puree and added spices.

Changes:

-Used about 3/4 to 1 cup of puree and a little more of each spice.

-Increased sugar by adding 1/4 c. more.

-Used 3 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs at room temperature.

-Folded in 1/2 cup sour cream after beating in each egg. I sat the sour cream out for about 30-40 min. so it wasn't super cold.

-Made my own gram cracker crust. 1 1/2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup whit sugar, 6 tablespoons melted butter. Mix and press to bottom, no need to prebake.

-Poured about half of white batter on the bottom to achieve more of a pronounced cheesecake layer.

-Baked for 1 hour at 350 in water bath that went half way up side of pan. (I placed my pan in a rectangle glass dish filled with water).

-After the hour, I opened the oven part way and let in cool down in there for another hour. Finally, it sat on the counter for 30 minutes before it went in the refrigerator over night.

SCRUMPTIOUS!

I had never made cheesecake before, so my review may be a little biased. I was worried because I had just enough time to set it for three hours, but it turned  out fine. I added pecans for garnish, and it looked very pretty, but tasted just okay as far as cheesecakes go.

I made 2 of these tonight for thanksgiving tomorrow! Came out delicious!!! I made sure eggs and cream cheese were at room temperature. I also added more of all the spices and about 1/4 cup more of sugar. I baked them in water baths at 350 for about 45-50 min. I made a pecan graham cracker crust using 1 3/4 cup

Awesome, easy recipe! A new "go-to" for sure. We had gluten-free guests for dinner recently, so as a pre-Tday test, I made this with a GF gingerbread crust I found...yummy!! Can't wait to try my own spin using ginger snaps.

I have been using this recipe since about 2002, when I made my first thanksgiving dinner. I do some small changes though. I always save a little of the cream cheese filling in a snack bag to help decorate the top once I add the pumpkin mixture. I also put more like 3/4 cup of pumpkin, a little brown sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice in the mixture. When the pie has about 10-15 minutes to finish cooking, I pull it out and add a pecan streusel around the outer edges. I let it cook the rest of the way and cool as instructed. I also don't use any whipped cream. Thanks so much for this recipe, my family and friends will not let me enter any holiday gathering without the pie in my hands!

It was definitely not sweet enough at all. Would recommend adding more sugar like at least 3/4 cup sugar.

Absolutely stunning recipe I am a cheesecake lover. when I heard about this I had to try it and I'm am glad I did. The cheesecake part turned out fantastically with the contrast to the pumpkin part overall 11 out of 10 for this one. Plus whipped cream makes everything better

I really don't like anything that is pumpkin but since it's thanksgiving I thought I might give this a try..and so I followed exactly what's on the recipe how it's cook and all. Let it chill overnight and oh my gosh I ddn't expect it would taste sooo good. I will definitely keep this recipe and will make it again. Thankyou so much for sharing

This is really good! Made my own crust though. It doesn't make a very tall cheesecake so if that's what you're looking for you have to make more batter. (Double it maybe? I'm gonna do that next time and see how it works out)  just as is it's very very good. My husband was in heaven when he tried it. I will be making this again!

This recipe is the best.

I doubled up on the recipe, but I used pumpkin spice instead and I baked in a springform pan and made my own graham cracker crust.
(crust on bottom only)

bake at 325 for 1hr and 20min let cool in oven
with door open for 30min then chill overnight.

Made it all with the pumpkin. Cooked it longer and it still didn't cook all the way in middle. Did not taste like a cheesecake more like a cheese pie. Wont be making again.

This recipe was easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was disappointed while making it because I didn't think you'd really notice the layers but you did once it had set.  Rave reviews on this one - people asked for the recipe - I will make it again.  I used a storebought pie crust but I think I might make a homemade crust next time and make it in the springform pan to show off the layers.

I don't think it came out as "pretty" as the picture. The seasonings were strong and overbearing to the cheesecake.

I don't have much baking experience except for making some things that come out of a box. But I do have considerable experience eating at high-end restaurants, and let me tell you:  I made this cheesecake because it looked divine (and it was time for me to grow up and get some baking/culinary skills.)  so I made it last weekend. Wow!  By far, the best cheesecake I have ever had. My partner and I devoured it. Today, I have the chocolate chip cheesecake (on this website) baking in the oven as I type this review. Kudos to the originator of this recipe. Six stars out of five!

Have substituted chocolate chips for pumpkin(and spices) with the same rave reviews!

Made for the first time today. I didn't change a single ingredient, however, I used a "Cheesecake Moat" to augment the baking process.the moat is a pan within a pan. You put boiling water in the moat. It adds a deeper consistent penetrating heat while keeping moisture in the air. The pie was done in thirty five minutes. Our guests couldn't believe that I made it at six this morning. It is simple and provides a fantastic dessert for family and guests.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It had a great flavor and wasn't too "heavy".  I made two substitutions to make this a bit healthier:  I used 1/3 light cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and 1/4 cup Domino blend (sugar/stevia combination) instead of 1/2 cup sugar.  I will make this again!

DH made this one; I have only eaten it.  As an eater, let me vouch that it is simply wonderful!!  Hubs doesn't stray from recipes; he made it as written. ...Well, once he pressed graham crackers & butter into the pie plate, otherwise he uses store-bought).
Don't waste your time with Cool whip - top with freshly whipped cream (it's WELL worth it - whipping cream, sugar & a little vanilla to taste, whip until peaks form when you pull out the beaters).

Use all the ingredients listed but use regular pumpkin pie filling instead of puree. That punches up the taste to another level. I like Polar pumpkin pie filling but at times it is hard to find. It comes in a 15 oz can so there is little waste of product.  Making one now for quests tonight with Polar.

Update: Oct. '15  I used 1 pkg of pumpkin cream cheese in lieu of a regular 8oz Philadelphia CC.  Trader Joe's have this in their stores in the fall mons.  Very nice addition.

This recipe is amazing!  I was looking for a pumpkin cheesecake recipe when I came across this one.  I didn't bother separating the layers.  After taste-testing (before I added the eggs), I decided to add some pumpkin spice to add a little bolder flavor.

I made a change with the crust when I tried this recipe (my husband and I don't like graham cracker crust).  So, what I did was set my oven to 425 degrees then use my traditional crust, rolled out, floured the pie pan, laid the crust out, cut the excess, pinch the edges and poke holes in the bottom with a fork.  Then I make the filling according to the above recipe, layers and all.  After getting the second layer on I place the pie in the oven for 10 minutes.  When my timer sounds I turn the oven down to the 325 degrees it calls for and cook for the additional 30 minutes.  Test with a toothpick and viola!  Pumpkin Cheesecake out of the oven to cool and you look like you spent all day!

Delicious! I even tried subbing flax seed for one of the eggs to increase the healthy factor and it was still incredible!

Love this recipe! I personally HATE pumpkin pie, and this past Thanksgiving was asked to bring a pumpkin and apple pie (I made the grandma Ople apple pie which is amazing!) Since I hate pumpkin pie so much I thought, I'll see if I can find an alternative to that boring old pie! Then I found this. Store bought or home made, the crust goes so well with the pumpkin and cream cheese filling. The high school boys fought over who got the last slice and now I make it for them when they get straight As on their progress reports and report cards. I've made this several times and the only change I have made is using pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, but I only do that because I don't have cloves or nutmeg and have a ton of PPS.

Happy eating!

This was wonderful!  Not an intense pumpkin and spice flavor, which I love, but a really delicious smooth cheesecakey pumpkin with some spice.  Very lovely!  It'll be on our table regularly!

This recipe produces a wonderful cheesecake. Double layer idea is easily applicable to any flavor of cheesecake if the ingredients are adjusted.

Oh I loved this recipe! It was all around fun for me, the ingredients were easy to gather and everything pulled together nicely in the end. My friends couldn't keep their sticky little fingers out of the cheesecake and needless to say, I didn't even get a big slice for myself. Obviously I'll be making TWO of them the next time.

I use this recipe all the time! I usually make a crust though, using one of the graham-cracker-crust recipes on this site. Without altering anything except bake time (30 min), this recipe can be used to make mini or bite sized cheesecakes in cupcake papers, half regular flavor and half pumpkin. Or, instead of adding pumpkin , you can add half a cup of Nutella for a change.

DELICIOUS! I have made and brought this pie to numerous functions and is always gone within minutes.  Only thing I did differently was I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the clove,cinnamon and nutmeg.

It was my first time making cheesecake, and this was amazing.  Everyone loved it, and I'll definitely be making it again and again.  I used pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree, and I cooked it between 50-55 minutes because it was not anywhere close to done after 35-40 mins.

I thought it needed to be cooked longer, I checked it at 35 and took it out at 40 but it could have used another 5-10 minutes, it was too runny.  But it tasted good and was eaten at our holiday party.

I have made this recipe three times and never had a single complaint or even an indifferent remark! It is easy and delicious! Making it again this Christmas and looks like a new holiday favorite with requests by my family. I didn't change a thing.

I love any recipe that makes me look like I can do a dessert!! This one is yummy! I tried it to make sure it would turn out for Xmas and this is it!! It's smooth, pumpkiny without overpowering with that clove flavors. I didn't think I could pull off a cheesecake but this recipe made sure I could!

Made this cheesecake yesterday with the help of my 9 year old son and it was absolutely amazingly insanely delicious!!! Better than most store bought cheesecakes, no doubt.  And this is the first time I ever baked or made a cheesecake. We did have a few minor adjustments.  We did not have a prepared graham cracker crust, but we did have graham cracker crumbs so we made our own crust following instructions on the box (easy and delicious!).  Also, added 1/2 cup light brown sugar to the pumpkin portion of the cheesecake and skipped nutmeg and cloves as my son does not like those. :) It did take a little longer than 35-40 minutes to bake, but that is probably because our oven is older. Other than that, followed this recipe step by step, and voila! The cheesecake was mostly gone in 30 minutes! :) We will be making it again next weekend.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it! The only changes I made were to add 1 cup of pumpkin pie filling and cooking it for about 45 minutes. This is going to be a new go-to dessert. It was amazing and simple!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was so popular with everyone that I've been told I have to make it every year now.  I do go with other suggestions and made the cheesecake layer thicker  than the pumpkin...great!

This deserves at least 10 stars. I made it for the first time for my church and everyone loved it! It was devoured in seconds. People again and again come up and ask me to make it again! Myself being a big fan of cheesecakes of all kinds was astonished! The great part about this was that it was so light and fluffy, the texture was amazing and you can make it the night before! This is a definite keeper that I will be pulling out again and again, not just in the fall!

This was great!!  And so easy -- I made two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving - this one and a traditional baked pie, and this one was gone immediately.  I made a cranberry topping to drizzle over the whipped topping (just a cranberry syrup, really), and it really jazzed it up!  This recipe is definitely a permanent addition to our Thanksgiving dinner.

I'm not one to write reviews; however thought this recipe definitely was worth it.  I've made it the past 2 Thanksgivings with rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception...I used 1.5cups of the cream cheese layer for the bottom layer.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I have tried several recipes for pumpkin cheesecake but this one is of the best. But instead of layering it i just mix it all together. This one is a family favorite.

Love this recipe. I first made this in 2005, my first cheescake of any kind and it is so simple and delicious! When we lived in the states I made it every Thanksgiving.. with cream cheese being so expensive in China, we are missing it so. Great recipe!

This was AMAZING!!! I baked 2  of these since my family loves cheesecake.  The pumpkin gave  the  cheesecake a decadent delicious twist. I am definitely making this a  must-have during holidays,  gatherings, etc!

Made this for my dad's birthday since he's a huge fan of both pumpkin pie and cheesecake - I think he nailed it when he said it's the "best of both worlds!" As some had suggested I was generous with the pumpkin and topped it with pecans and whipped cream on the side, of course.  Great, rich flavours and nice and creamy.  Will definitely make this one again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I did use a water bath and turned the oven off, leaving it in there for about ten minutes with the door cracked. Will make again throughout the holiday season.

This is a great recipe! I did use other reviewer suggestions to make it more cheese cakey..lol I added 1 extra brick of cream cheese, 1/2cup of sour cream after the eggs also 1 extra egg. I made in a springform pan 9in. With Graham cracker crust. My family said we needed to add this to EVERY holiday menu! My bf and I are fighting over the last piece. Hehe he thinks he stands a chance.. Lol pumpkin and cheesecake are a matched made in Heaven!

This recipe was a hit - I made it into cheesecake bars.  I made the graham cracker crust I recipe from this site and doubled it.  I used about 3/4+ to make a 1/4 inch layer in a glass 9x13 pan and baked as directed, but for 11 min.  Then doubled this cheesecake recipe and followed exactly for a doubled recipe and poured on top of cooled crust.  Baked at 325 for about 50-55 min when outer 2 edges were set and the inside jiggled slightly.  Let cool on the counter and then finisehd cooling in the fridge.  Then cut into bars.

It was very good but like other reviews have said, it's more like a pie than a cheesecake. I think it needed more than a pinch of ginger and cloves. I'd maybe add some nutmeg too.

I've made this pie every thanksgiving and people never eat any of the other pie available because  its so good. Some hints: use a large double layer crust because the normal ones don't fit all the batter, use a blender to mix after every step to decrease lumps,  bake in a water bath (optional it helps so the crust isn't too dark), don'the open the oven too much  while baking the reduce cracks. I also like to freeze it for a couple hours to set, and I cover it with cool whip and sprinkle cinnamon on the top.

I made this for the first time last year and my husband just loved it! Now he doesn't even want me to make regular pumpkin pies.  Most definitely a recipe to keep!

I read the reviews and tweaked the measurements a little, and now I need a deep dish pie crust so the filling will fit, but I don't mind. :-)

Fantastic! I used a lil extra cinnamon and a pinch of salt in the pumpkin mixture. Forget about the whipped cream for the top, this is so rich and delicious, it's not needed.

LOVED IT, i am no cook/baker and this was easy...really dont know where others may have gone wrong, probably didnt soften the cheese enough??? the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is that i want a thicker cheese cake layer, so for thanksgiving i am doubling the recipe, using a larger pie crust and using the left over pumpkin mixture to make bite sized snacks :)

My first crack at pumpkin cheesecake was a huge success!  Like some of the other reviewers, I chose to add an entire can of pumpkin, more sugar and pumpkin pie spice (in addition to cloves and cinnamon) to the recipe.  It's tough to mess it up if you taste as you go.  I took it to work with me; I set it out at 9am and it was gone before 10.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't make any changes other than to make 1.5 times the filling and using two prepared graham cracker crusts. I found that doing this left me with just a bit of canned pure pumpkin, so I went ahead and used the remainder of it in the filling and added an extra dash of the spices to accompany it. The texture of the cheesecake was light yet creamy at the same time, and I had no problems with cracking. I placed a pan of water on the bottom rack just to be safe. When the timer went off, I checked them then turned the oven off and left the cheesecakes for about 15 minutes. When I removed them, they were perfectly set and beautiful. Everyone at my church was impressed with this dessert! Thanks for a keeper that will be added to the Autumn rotation!

It's good, but too creamy for my personal preference. I would have liked it to be more dense. Of course, this is my personal preference and not the recipe's fault, so it's still a 5-star recipe. Next time I will make it more dense. I used crushed Golden Oreo cookies for the crust (the hubs raved!), used three blocks of cream cheese, a whole can of pumpkin pie filling, and added a tablespoon of Frangelico to the pumpkin pie filling, as well as a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg.

Amazing!  Way better than I expected.  The only change I made was I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cups of pumpkin as I saw suggested in some comments.  It was great!

Giving it 4 because I used this recipe as my inspiration... I've been making double layer pumpkin  cheesecake for years now and it's everyone's first holiday request.  I double the ingredients, use canned pumpkin pie mix, and make a home made gingersnap crust. I use my spring form pan.  Done this way, it looks professional.  It's taller and thicker and when you slice it you can see the contrast between the dark crust, white layer and orange pumpkin on top... it's very pretty and just as delicious!

Made this last Thanksgiving. We instantly deemed this to be a new tradition going forward. I made this by the recipe and it was easy and tastes amazing.

This came out great! I increased the pumpkin to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, which I would recommend. The only change I would make would be to pour half of the cream cheese mixture into the pie shell, then mix the pumpkin and spices in the other half so that the pumpkin taste would be stronger. My cheesecake was perfectly done in 35 minutes in my convection oven.

Making cheesecake for the first time, this was definitely easier than I thought it was going to be. Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe to make to make two cheesecakes. I used someone else's advice and just got the pumpkin pie spices to avoid buying each individual one and just added a little extra. It turned out perfect. I will definitely be making this one again.

I added half a brick of cream cheese and it turned out great. Definitely needed more than 40 minutes in the oven though.

Made this twice already. It is delicious! The first time I made it, I only had one package of cream cheese, so I improvised and added a little sour cream to add volume. The batter was also a little runny because of that and I ended up creating a marbled pumpkin layer (it wouldn't stay as a separate layer). Nonetheless, this was a FANTASTIC way to enjoy both pumpkin pie and cheesecake at the same time. Love it, thanks for sharing!

I don't eat cheesecake, but everyone I've made this for so far love it.  In fact, the one I made last night, I forgot to put the eggs in at first.  I only got 1 egg into the pumpkin mixture part.  I don't think anyone noticed.

I did something more chocolate-y!  I used Philadelphia CHOCOLATE Cream Cheese.  I basically divided the recipe in half.  For the first cream cheese layer, I used 1 egg, 1/4c (4 tbsp) sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 250g Chocolate Cream Cheese. Creamed everything together and placed in a pie crust.  For the pumpkin cheesecake layer, I wanted more pumpkin flavour so I used less regular cream cheese and more pumpkin. I modified using only 3/4 portion of a package of cream cheese along with 1 egg, 1/4c of sugar and 1/4tsp vanilla. Then I used 3/4c of pumpkin puree along 3/4tsp of pumpkin spice and 1/2tsp of cinnamon because I like mine more cinnamon-y!  I baked it a bit longer since I had more pumpkin maybe by 5-10 mins.  It was a big hit with the chocolate layer especially!  Everyone thought it tasted like chocolate pudding!  I also used real Oreo cookie crumbs dividing the two layers and a chocolate graham crust and it was sooo good!

I really loved this recipe.  Think the next time I will increase the pumpkin flavour and add a little more spice. My daughter just raved and we will make it again and again.  I also used the pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree. Yummy

I substituted fresh roasted pumpkin for the canned and it turned out fabulous.  I also used a home made vanilla and cinnamon spice whipped cream.  It was a HUGE hit!  I will make this again on Thanksgiving for sure.

Hi, I made this (can't cook) and my family loved it.  I used pumpkin pie filling, added more spices & more pumpkin.  Doesn't need topping but the carmel is a great idea.

Delicious! I modified the recipe a bit and put it in a springform pan. I used 2 packages of cream cheese and one 300g package of ricotta, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup of pumpkin puree. I also changed the spices up a bit, I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp ground cloves. For the crust I used 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 6 tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp ground ginger and a pinch of salt.

Very good, made as directed, next time pour more of the orig batter so it's more 1/2 and 1/2. really good though, probably doesn't need whipped cream

I have made this recipe for several years now and always get requests for extras so they can bring to their family thanksgiving dinners. I love pumpkin pie but sometimes get overwhelmed with too much "pumpkin" flavor. I think this cheesecake is perfect, not too much pumpkin but just right.

made it. love it. i think i should have used the smaller size graham crust though- i was afraid it would be too much filling for the smaller crust, but it would have been perfect and the layers would have been more obvious

Very good, my husband who hates cheesecake loved this. I used fat-free cream cheese expecting it to not be as good, but it still worked very well. Love the pumpkin flavor.

ABSOLUTELY DELISH!! Brought this to work to our Halloween party and I'm still getting requests for it!  I didn't have pumpkin purée so I used pumpkin pie filling and skipped the nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon.  Will be making this again and again!!

It looked great, the flavor was just ok. The pumpkin layer didn't really have that pumpkin taste I was looking for. Maybe I will add some more pumpkin spices and sugar next time I make it.

My boyfriend loved it- but I'm not quite sold on it. There was no detectable pumpkin taste. I even used ginger snaps for the crust and the cream cheese taste completely overwhelmed them.

I cheated and used prepared pumpkin pie mix from the store.  Far easier to make.  Don't skimp on the crust though...make that from scratch because it's much better tasting and simple to make.

Thank you for this recipe.  It is such a good marriage between the cheesecake and the pumpkin pie!  Yes, the cheese part isn't so "cheesecakey", but it really is so tasty.  Next time I will place 1 cup and a half of the cheese part (white part) instead of just a half of a cup because I like the taste of it and you will notice the layers better that way.  I will also add a lot more spices because I like extra spicy pumpkin pie.

This is a really good desert but I need to work on the presentation some because the top keeps seaming to crack on me. the overall taste is really good though. I do plan on making it again. I used pumpkin Puree and it turns out really well. I left out the cloves, I was afraid of that overbearing taste.

I`ve made this recipe numerous times, and it always gets eaten right away.  I put one cup of cream cheese mixture aside to mix with the pumpkin, and use the rest of the cream cheese for the bottom layer.  I also increase the amount of pumpkin and spices.

Very good.  I served to someone who doesn't like pumpkin and they ate two pieces of this. If using a springform pan use an 8" as a 9" or 10" makes a thin cake.

I made this a few week ago for a bunch of my husbands friends and their wives. Men are not like women, they dont run to the dessert table like we do. So I am not sure how the men felt, but I do know that the women we head over heels in love with this cheesecake! And so am I! Actually I take that back, my husband who isnt a cheesecake fan really enjoyed this. I am making it again tonight for my sissy in law who is having a mini new years eve bash at her home. It is so easy to make and its not too sweet. Happy New Years everyone! Wishing you all the health and happiness in the world!!! And most of all....

HAPPY EATING!!

I just tried this recipe for the first time. It was so easy to make! All of the ingredients were on hand. (I love recipes where you can find most, if not all of the ingredients in your kitchen and don't have to go out just to get the one or two items that you'll rarely use for other recipes.)
I followed this recipe exactly. I baked it for the lesser of the suggested times. At 35 minutes the pie came out a tad dry. but my family gobbled it up saying they didn't notice it being dry. I'll bake it for 30 minutes next time. And there will be a next time! It's a simple, yet impressive (two layers!, delicious cheese cake pie. It gets a five! The dryness could be attributed to oven temperament,weather, (it was raining) or altitude (sea level).Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe once two years ago and my hubby was hooked.  This is now his FAVORITE dessert ever(he says).  I am so pleased.  He asks for it on his birthday instead of cake and at Thanksgiving and Christmas. :-) I follow the recipe as it is EXCEPT that I do make my own crust (cinnamon graham crackers, butter, brown sugar). Makes this dessert twenty times better, I swear.  I hate store-bought crusts...

Also, the ground clove is a must.  It adds the most enchanting, exotic flavor.  It's worth it.

Excellent. We love cheesecake and the addition of pumpkin makes it perfect for the holidays. Made it for Thanksgiving and making it again for Xmas...  Like others, I poured a bit more of just the cheese cake, making the layers more even.

Made this recipe for my family from all homemade ingredients and it didn't even last through the night. It's a little sweeter than expected, but still an amazing recipe. I will be making this again in the future

This cheesecake is spectacular!  I made it for my family at Thanksgiving thinking that it wouldn't go over well, but it was the first pie gone!! Now I am making it for Christmas supper with my family by request!! Definitely worth making! Also to make the recipe just a little easier, I used a can of pumpkin pie mix, and it tastes just the same!

This is now going to be served at our house every Thanksgiving. I did listen to what other people said in their review and added 1/2 cup sour cream. The entire cheesecake was gone by the end of the day. Will have to make 2 next time..

Use a graham cracker pie crust instead of making a crust. recipe doesn't make enough filling to make a pretty spring-form cheescake.

My family loved this.  It is so easy and so delicious.  This one is a keeper.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used more cream cheese and added 1 cup sugar, and 1/3 cup sour cream. The texture was great and even with a deep dish pie crust, there was enough filling left for a second pie.  I did add enough of the cream cheese mixture for at least an inch for the first layer. I think that makes it more interesting.  I also used pre-made pumpkin pie filling, the whole can.  It was great.  Will definately be making this again.

I have made this cheesecake a few times now. Make sure you mix the pumpkin well or else you get lumps on the top layer. I get so many requests to make this for Halloween and Thanksgiving!

this recipe definetly needed some tweaking after I made it the first time. The cream cheese was definetly over powering you couldnt even taste the pumpkin. So, I decided to add 1 cup of sugar, instead of just a 1/2 cup. I also decided to add a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree. I think the adjustments worked perfectly, it turned out alot sweeter and you could taste the pumpkin a lot better.

Excellent - and my husband LOVED IT!  Tastes like cheesecake, but so much easier to make.  I doubled the recipe and made one "pie" without the crust in a loaf pan so my gluten-free friend could enjoy.  She ate it for breakfast!

So much tastier than your average pumpkin pie.  I added 4 oz cream cheese to beef up the 1st layer a bit.  Poured 1 and a half cups in the pie crust, then put it int he freezer while I mixed up the remaining ing.  I went a but heavy on the spices and pumkin as another reviewer suggested.  When I 1st tasted the pumpkin mixture I was worried- it wasn't great on its own- thought I went overboard on the spices but the end result was fantastic.  i think the cream cheese layer is meant to mellow the flavor of the pumpkin layer.  This went over really well at Thanksgiving.  Will definitely make again. Edit 11/2016- make this the Tuesday before Thanksgiving= that's the perfect amount of time for the flavors to come together. Use the bigger pie crust and beef up the cream cheese layer with an additional 4oz cc and add extra pumpkin and seasoning (easy on the nutmeg.  Top with cool whip and sprinkle with cinnamon.

Instead of a tired old graham cracker crust, I used the recipe on here for Molasses Sugar Cookies-placed the cookie dough in the bottom of my pan and baked for about 10 minutes. When I pulled the pan out of the stove I had the cream cheese layer ready to pour in, placed my pan back in the oven for 10 more minutes while I readied the pumpkin layer.  Once the pumpkin layer is in, I allow the cheesecake to bake undisturbed until the center doesn't appear glossy anymore. As soon as that sheen disappears I cut the oven off, allow the cheesecake to sit 10 more minutes then remove. We could care less about cracking, but it's minimal anyway. The molasses sugar cookie crust makes this cheesecake over-the-top and compliments the pumpkin beautifully.

Yay! Takes the pumpkin flavor of pumpkin pie and adds the dense-ness of cheesecake. :)

It was a huge hit and this will be on my menu every year! This cheesecake was delicious! I made it in an 8" cheesecake pan so The only negative was there wasn't enough batter. I also used 1 cup of pumpkin instead. Next time i will double the recipe. I prefer to make my own crust with 1 pkg smashed graham crackers and 3/4 stick melted butter. It's more cost effective and you never have to worry about the crust breaking as with the premade ones. Just go buy a cheesecake pan if you like making cheesecake!

Very good. I didn't use a crust to save calories & didn't add whipped topping for the same reason, other than that, made as directed. Next time I will use pumpkin pie spice. Thanks for the recipe.

WOW this recipe is amazing. Everyone loved it. I read a lot of the reviews and used the suggestions.
I used 3/4 cup pumpkin pie mix and 1/2 tsp cinnamon
and upped the suger to 3/4 cup.
Right before serving I drizzled it with caramel. 

AMAZING. I will make this every Thanksgiving. Plus I've been asked to make it for my brother in-laws bday this year.

This is SO GOOD! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was polished so fast. Even my sister's boyfriend who normally doesn't like anything pumpkin loved it. The only modification I have is I added a pinch of pumpkin pie seasoning. Such a great pie, I will make again next year (or maybe next week...)

My new go-to take along for holiday gatherings!  Just be sure not to undercook the cake.  I undercooked my first one and it was a goopy mess (still tasted good, though).  Since I wasn't sure what was meant by "the center is almost set," I use the springy to the touch rule.  If none sticks to your finger and it feels a bit like a cooked warm cupcake, it will be be good.

This pie was so yummy!!  I burnt the top of it trying to get the center done more.  I would adjust your temp. so that you can bake it a little longer so you do not have the same problem.  Other than that it was very good!  I added whipped topping and sprinkled cinnamon on top to give it a pleasing look. Have been asked for this recipe already!

This is REALLY good! Just be warned you will have a really cheesecakey taste, with slight pumpkin.  I used fat free cream cheese and eggbeaters to reduce the fat and calories.  I increased the sugar by a little bit to overcome the fat free cream cheese. It was awesome!

Yummy! This disappeared faster on thanksgiving than regular pumpkin pie.  IF I made any changes, it would be to add more spices as it is mild.  But it was such a big hit I'd think hard about changing anything.  Very easy to make.

Made one last year for Thanksgiving and it was gone in minutes after dinner.  I  made 2 this year and they lasted "slightly" longer.  Absolutely delicious...everyone wanted the recipe.  Amazingly simple to put together, especially with pre made crusts.  For last year's pie I had some extra Steenstra's almond cookies which I crushed up to make the crust...yum.  This year I just used ready made crusts and the pie was equally as good.

Made these for Thanksgiving this year.  Looked at the original recipe and then looked at the reviews, and then started baking.  Used the ginger snap crust someone recommended and then made one filling batch without the pumpkin and put in crust and then made another batch adding the pumpkin to it.  Then baking for about an hour plus.  Magnificot!  My family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed everyone's suggestions.  Did an extra brick of cream cheese, extra egg, and the whole can of pumpkin. Took 50 min to bake, let it cool in the oven... It was fabulous!

Phenomenal! Made with homemade graham cracker crust (also found on this site) it worked fantastically. Pretty easy and quick to make. Instead of using individual spices I used pumpkin pie spice. Family favorite for sure!

My family loves this super easy cheesecake! I use a springform pan and dust cinnamon leaves on the top with a stencil for decoration.  If I don't have pumpkin puree I just use pumpkin pie filling and omit the spices.  I will be making this every year!

Made this for thanksgiving. I have never made a cheesecake before (probably because I have never liked them) but my husband is a cheesecake fanatic. He can't get enough of it, I even like it! Will definitely be adding this to my permanent recipe collection.

This came out beautifully and it was quite easy to do! It has the classic taste of pumpkin pie but the cheesecake gives it a little elegance. Wow....this Is going to be a thing on my menu every thanksgiving from now on!

This is a great recipe. It's very easy to make; my non-cooking roommate made it with no issues whatsoever. It's also, of course, delicious.

Is the temperature a typo? I have tried this recipe twice, and both times the cheesecake was extremely goopy and undercooked. The second time I increased the temperature to 350 and cooked the cheesecake for over 60 minutes to no avail.

Oh my goodness!!! This is the best recipe ever!! I decorated it with cool whip that I colored. I made it for an event I was going to and it won 1st place! It really needs to be cold though. If its not it doesn't taste as good.

I tried this today and LOVED it! I am definitely going to be making this again in a few days to take to my parents' house for Thanksgiving! Just enough pumpkin taste to make me happy, but also some cheesecake to satisfy that craving. Perfect!

I've been making cheesecakes for a little over a year. I have stuck with that recipe until now! I think this was an amazing recipe. I loved it, the only thing I did was added more pumpkin ;). It was awesome!

I'll start by saying I am NOT a fan of pumpkin pie.  But I love this.  Much smoother, and a much richer flavor than regular pumpkin pie.  If you are looking for a way to kick it up a few notches, this is it.  EDIT: 35-40 minutes is NOT enough time.  Probably closer to 50 minutes.

I followed the recipe somewhat. I added 8 oz. more cream cheese. I also made sure there was more of the plain mixture, equal to the pumpkin mix. I used pumpkin pie mix, and added cream cheese frosting to the top. it was better than the original recipe.

Tried this, was my very first cheesecake.  The only issue I had was I added a whole can of pumpkin (i really love my pumpkin flavors) and the outsides of the pie was thick, just the way it should be, but the middle was still gooey.  Baked it the full 40 mins, and refrigerated it 4 hours before consuming.  The next day the middle was a bit more thicker, but not by much.  Still loved the flavors though!  Didn't use cloves or nutmeg, pretty much used the cinnamon and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice.  Also found a difference recipe for the crust, which turned out amazing!

This is an easy recipe to make, I used brown eggs and they made it taste better than with white. Very creamy, though I would prefer more pumpkin taste if/when I make this again.

I did not think this cheesecake was quite sweet enough!  I made my own crust, maybe that's the reason.  Next time I will add 1/8 cup of sugar.

Loved it!  This was my first time making cheesecake ever and was surprised by how easy it was!  I used pumpkin pie mix instead of puree to cut steps and it turned out really good.  I've made this twice already and I can't wait till I make it for parties!  And I was confused with those that said there wasn't enough cheesecake when the whole recipe is pumpkin cheesecake!

I didn't have a spring form pan so I improvised and used cupcake tins, they're not the typical size - slightly smaller but not as small as a mini muffin tin would be. Anywho, I also didn't have a crust, so I used store brand cinnamon graham crackers (that I pulverized with a crude little 'underside of a small flat bowl' trick :D ) mixed with butter - lined the bottom of the cups with that and proceeded with the recipe. They came out AMAZING. I brought a tray to work with a can of whipped cream and a bottle of chocolate syrup - they were all gone by lunch time! I will ABSOLUTELY be using this recipe again. It was simple, creative and looked like it took far more effort and much longer than it did in reality. Work smarter, not harder! My kinda recipe!

This recipe is AMAZING. I read many of the reviews before making it and followed the suggestions of others and used an extra 8oz block of cream cheese and about 3/4 of a can of pumpkin. For the spices, at first I used the amount the recipe calls for but it was a little bland and very pumpkiny so I added a little more of all the spices. I did not bake in a water bath so it did crack a lot while cooking (which took about an hour), but who cares it still tastes the same! My boyfriend and I were getting antsy to try it so we put it in the freezer for a couple hours to speed up the cooling process and it turned out so good! I also made a caramel sauce to drizzle on top (from food network titled "easy caramel sauce" - it's delish). My boyfriend took one bite and said, "This is f***ing amazing. I am speechless." WIN!

Tried this for the first time for our Thanksgiving (Canadian). I personally found it really rich and cream cheesy tasting but it was a hit with the rest of the family! Will definitely make this one again.

AMAZING! After reading great reviews I was convinced to make this for Thanksgiving this year, and am I ever glad I did. It was a hit with everyone. The pumpkin taste was perfect, and was delicious. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

I made this cheese cake according to SOUTHERNBELLE0908’s recommendations and loved it!
my only suggestions would be to make the day before u plan on serving. Letting it set over night really brings out all the flavors and makes it taste totally different compared to right out of the oven.
I will definitely be making this again!

Super easy, super delicious, super fun to make. I skipped the whip topping because I didn't like it and replaced it with vanilla ice cream instead. It was a hit with everyone. LOVED IT!!!

Very Good.  Made a trial run on this as a possible dessert choice for Thnksgvng.  Added a little sour cream to the cream cheese mixture, and more like 3/4 c. pumpkin.  Super easy! Deifinately going on the the Thxgvg menu this year!

This was so easy to make and tastes amazing! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 3/4 cup pumpkin pie filling rather than the pumpkin puree, nutmeg and cloves. I will definitely be making this one again and again.

I love this recipe. It's my go-to fall dessert. It is so simple and delicious. I follow the recipe exactly, baking it the recommended amount of time and then leaving it in the turned-off oven until set.

Got rave reviews!  I made a couple alterations.  I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream to the cheesecake mix, extra cinnamon, and a teenie more vanilla.

This pumpkin cheesecake was PERFECT!!! I only added 2 TBSP of extra sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also used the can pumpkin pie mix because it has the spices already mixed in....this cheesecake was awesome and it only lasted for 1 day in my house. I will be making this at least 3 times a month!!!

This was delicious, but the pumpkin layer didn't turn out as firm as the plain layer.  It was my first cheesecake, though.  So hopefully it'll turn out better next time.

I love this recipe! Most pumpkin cheesecake recipes I have tried turn out to be pretty much like regular pumpkin pie, very dense and very pumpkin which my husband and I don't like. This recipe was awesome! It is creamy and the pumpkin and spice is very light and not overwhelming. I will be making this again and I am actually going to make a couple of them for gifts for the holiday.

Yum! I have made other pumpkin cheesecakes in the past and no one has touched them. But with this recipe I had no leftovers at Thanksgiving! Can't wait to make it for Christmas!

This is such a good easy recipe! I was really nervous, I've never made pumpkin pie or cheesecake so I followed the recipe to the T. It turned out perfect!! It did have one tiny crack in the top, but I think next time I'll try the water bath like others did. I can't wait to make this again at Christmas! I will probably make it before then too just because it's so yummy.

Made this pie because I ate a pumpkin cheesecake pie from the cheesecake factory which was delicious and I wanted to see if this was comparable! Well it is and it was delicious! Made this for my husbands potluck at work and it was gone quickly! Made it also for thanksgiving and it was the favorite pie. I made it with pumpkin pie mix due to prior recipe suggestions,  best pumpkin pie substitute ever!

AWESOME!  This pie was easy and quick to make (1/2 the time it took for a fresh pumpkin pie) and tasted rich and delicious like it was from the Cheesecake Factory or something.  Everyone loved it.  It is extremely rich however, so a smaller piece is appropriate and I think I'm going to try a lower fat version.  What a phenomenal recipe!

Made this for thanksgiving today and got RAVE reviews! Everyone said it's the best cheesecake they've ever tasted :)  My only gripe:  the recipe needs to be doubled because this comes out really thin and more like a pie.  As a result I cut them into bite sized pieces so it would look better

Got tons of compliments on this recipe! The only thing I changed was instead of nutmeg & cloves, I used half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and I used fresh pumpkin. I have a feeling I'll be asked to make this again!

Super easy to make!  Since I didn't have a mixer, I did it all by hand.  I added an extra splash of vanilla extract into the plain layer and sprinkled a lil ginger on the store-bought crust.

This is the best pumpkin I have ever made. It has a real Fall comfort feel to it. You have to make this at least once. Oh, and I didn't change a thing.

I messed this up, but still salvaged a great cheesecake out of it. We forgot to take out the first layer and beat it all together. In order to make it richer, I added another half a cup of sugar, half a cup of pumpkin, and half a tsp all spice. It was enough for two nine inch crusts. Baked per directions, they were fantastic.

This was good, I added extra cream cheese and sour cream as recommended by SouthernBelle, I think a bit more sugar and extra spices would have helped even out this addition. Overall the flavor was very nice.

I won my company bake off with this recipe. Everyone loved it. I made a spider from black licorice and made a orange web with frosting.

Super simple!. I used a pie crust instead of graham cracker crust. I used Pumpkin pie spice instead of the listed ingredients. Next time i will use more spice but it is still so yummy!

This was easy to put together and very tasty.  I'm not big on cheescakes without some type of chocolate involved, but this was pretty tasty.  The pumpkin had just the right spices to make it very tasty.  Will probably make again for future holiday gatherings.

This is a great pumpkin filling.  I tripled the recipe, omitted the nutmeg and added a pinch of ginger.  I baked this in a 9 x 13 pan with my own oatmeal crumb base on the bottom. Baking time about 60 min.  It served up easily in squares and was positively delicious!

Overall, a pretty good pumpkin cheesecake. Texture was great; dense, yet creamy. I would definitely add pumpkin pie spice as the flavor was lacking a tiny bit. Next time around I will double the recipe, but still use a 9 inch pan. It shrunk to just over an inch after baking. I prefer thick cheesecake. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good.  I discovered that (cheaper) cracker crumbs worked just fine, even tasted like a "gingersnap crust" when I added ginger and sugar. Other than that, what an incredible recipe!

The perfect fall cheesecake.  I made my own crust with graham crackers, brown sugar and cinnamon.  I also used some reduced fat cream cheese in the filling.  Served with fresh whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg - yum!

This came out great and was so easy.  Instead of using a graham cracker crust I made a cookie crust using organic chocolate creme cookies (about 25 cookies and 3 tablespoons butter)

This "cheesecake" was pretty good. It did taste a lot more like a cream cheese pie then. I did what a lot of people mentioned and used pumpkin pie 'mix' which is basically filling, I did use a little less then 1/2 cup of sugar, and half of the seasonings since its already seasoned, but i wanted a little extra spice. Its really hard to blend completely smooth so mine DID end up getting clumps in it, make sure you blend it really well. I didn't get much of a "layered" affect either, but that didn't matter. It took 3 hours to solidify enough to cut. The flavor, texture, and crust was really good. Overall, 5 stars.

Made this with Graham Cracker Crust I (recipe found on allrecipes) and family LOVED it.  The only changes made were I put about 2 cups of the plain cheesecake mix on the bottom and added about another 1/2 cup - 1 cup of pumpkin for the top layer, but that was a personal preference.  I REALLY wanted a cheesecake bottom with more of a pumpkin pie topping.  Served with whipped cream, and family absolutely LOVED it!!! Only complaint is that it is really rich and heavy after a big meal, but was a very nice day after Thanksgiving leftovers!!! Thank you!!!!!!

I made it like a few of the other reviews recommended - with an extra 8oz of cream cheese, extra pumpkin pie filling, and 1/2 C of sour cream.  I made a graham cracker crust and put it in a springform pan, which I wrapped with tin foil before putting it in the water bath.  I've never made a cheesecake before so was just following instructions for that part.  The cheesecake floated in the pan, which I thought was weird, and despite two layers of tin foil it leaked water onto the filling.  It's cooking now (without the water bath) so it remains to be seen if this can be salvaged.  Does anyone have any suggestions for making sure the water doesn't leak in?  I was doing so well up to that point!!

I made this for an open house at work and it was the hit of the day!  (And there were many tasty pumpkin treats to choose from.)  I was worried that it wasn't going to turn out because it still seemed quite "jiggly" when I took it out of the oven (even after giving it the full 40 minutes plus another 5 after I turned the heat off), but it turned out well.  A very nice, moist cheesecake.

Very nice pumpkin cheesecake. However, I don't think I'll make it again. Maybe it could use a little flour in it or something maybe.

This is the most amazing cheesecake ever.  I love to make it as much as I can during the Thanksgiving season.  It is so much better than regular pumkin pie.  Its so easy and I didn't change a thing.  Now I should learn how to make homeade whip cream to go with it.

Oh baby this was so delicious. I made my own crust and modified the recipe by using healthier and natural ingredients. I hate to say this because I feel like a glutton but a bit more sugar is needed in the pumpkin mixture.  I did not have crushed cloves so I tried to use my own. Not a smart idea. Other than that it was a  very delicious treat. Thank you for sharing that recipe  it was  a fun challenge!

I have a lot of family members on weight watchers, so I always look for modifications without losing the taste. I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar, made my own crust with reduced fat graham crackers, and used neufchatel cheese, and it still tasted fabulous! I also kept a pan of water below the cheesecake while baking. I baked for closer to 50 minutes. Was a huge hit and will be making this one over and over again!

It was okay. The flavor was fine. I did add more pumpkin and spices. I think i prefer cheesecake and pumpkin pie separate. Very easy and very pretty pie to make. It looks impressive.

So easy.  I didn't even have all the spices only the cinnamon and it turned out great.  I might consider baking it longer but will have to see how firm it gets after being in the fridge for a few hours.  Really if you like simple, easy, and good recipes this is a keeper.

I made this for Christmas Desert, and it was a hit! I'm not a baker, but it was easy to throw together, and with the two layers everybody was SO IMPRESSED!!! I was even surprised at how good it turned out! I used the ready made pie crusts, but next time I'm going to try using a graham cracker crust!

My family adored this and so did I . . . after I got over the idea that it's much less pumpkiny than pumpkin pie.  It's much more like cheesecake with a pumpkin undertone.  It's a nice, mellow, yummy, creamy flavor, and the pie did not last ten minutes on my table (serving only four people that night).

I live in NZ so no graham crackers let alone store bought graham cracker crust, I used digestive biscuits, butter and a little lemon zest and juice to make a crust. Also no pumpkin in a can so I roasted some pumpkin and pureed that.  I results were good, everyone like it, and it looked really pretty with the 2 layers. I thought the cheese layer was quite heavy and dense, had good flavour though, perfect for introducing a pumpkin flavoured dessert to people that haven't had pumpkin pie before.

This was fantastic!  And not difficult at all!  The pumpkin flavor is great, not overwhelming.  And the creaminess...my family loved it!  Also, it was beautiful.  I had no issues with cracking.  Just be sure not to overbeat it. I made mine in regular 9-in pie pans, which is not ideal, but it worked out just fine.  Here's a tip: I made two this time, and I only had one pan to do a water bath.  The one that sat directly on the oven rack turned out nicely, and tasted great, but had a lump here or there on the surface.  The one in the water bath, however, was had a flawless surface and texture (in comparison with the other one).  Use a water bath - it's easy and it makes a significant difference.  Great recipe - I'll be using it again.

We are not pumpkin pie fans so not sure why I decided to try this but it was great!!  I to used an additional block of cream cheese and added a little more sugar.  I also used pumpkin pie filling and added the spices to that.  I found a large graham cracker crust and it was the perfect size. Drizzled caramel topping on each slice and with a little whipped cream.  YUMMY!!

SO GOOD!! Be sure so have the cream cheese very soft before making, otherwise you will have nasty chunks of cream cheese in it and the texture will be off.

this cheese cake is GREAT, i used the pumpkin pie filling instead of buying all the spices. I also used more cream cheese layer. Next time I'm going to try mixing the top layer in with the cream cheese flavor the only complaint I had was the texture. That will fix the texture issue.

As other reviewers have stated it is a bit on the thin side which can be an easy fix with a little more cream cheese.  All in all, a smash hit with family and friends!

I LOVED this recipe and it was so incredibly easy. The only things I changed: Used a little over 3/4 of a cup of pumpkin pie filling, but still used the spices. In the future, I may change the sugar to 2/3 of a cup. Delicious! It also took my oven a while to cook it. About 55 minutes, turned the oven off, opened the door, and let it sit for an hour.

My husband begs for this recipe around the holidays. I followed someone's suggestion the last time I made it - I doubled the cream cheese mixture and pumpkin mixture. It turned out great! I will make this year after year if my husband has anything to say about it!

This is very easy to make and tastes good. A homemade graham cracker crust and the use of whipped cream rather than cool whip would make it a four star recipe.

this went over very well this thanksgiving. in the past, i've made a pumpkin pie every year. my family doesn't particularly love pumpkin pie, so there was generally a good amount left. i made this cheesecake this past thanksgiving instead, and the entire thing was eaten!

OMG this is the best I have made this recipe two years in a row and it is a big hit! The first time I made it I sat it out and before I was able to get a slice it was gone!   Also I made a double batch for my husband to take to work but used the small graham pie crust, it made 18 individual pies and one regular size too! Great Recipe! Definitely a keeper! And you better get your slice first or it will be gone!

Used pumpkin pie spice, but should have used a lot more.  Not much pumpkin pie spice flavor.  Good texture, used a regular pie crust.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!  This is such a great and easy recipe.  We all loved it.  I made my own crust to save money but either way it is one of my favorite recipes that I have gotten from this site.  Thank you.

Wonderful recipe.  I tried the suggestion of adding an extra 8oz of cream cheese as well as canned pumpkin pie filling--I ended up tasting and adding additional spices.  Tastes great, but I had a bit of a scare waiting as it was baking.  I was not aware that cheesecake remains extremely liquid-like around the center so I overcooked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. (I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie) It's not too sweet, and not to much pumpkin flavoring.

I have made this several times, including this past weekend for Thanksgiving.  I like to use a little more of the cheesecake to make the bottom cheese cake layer, but other than that, this is an excellent recipe.

This was fantastic!  I followed the advice of some others and used Libby's pumpkin pie filling rather than plain puree + spices.  I also added an additional 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese, and made a homemade graham cracker crust rather than a prepared crust.  I put the batter in a food processor to get out all lumps and air pockets, and baked it in a water bath.  It was so smooth and creamy, I got tons of compliments on Thanksgiving!

This cheesecake was amazing!  The only changes I made were: a) I cooked it for a little longer and b) I added a little cinnamon and sugar to the graham cracker crust.

OK I tried to make this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and I attempted to make it exactly according to the instructions. I am only going to give this 3 stars as the baking time is ALL WRONG!!! The taste was pretty good but be sure to check your cheesecake thoroughly before taking it out. I made this mistake (following the directions) and it ruined the whole dessert. Just be careful and I am sure it will come out fine.

Absolutely delicious! I varied this a bit by using a gingersnap and pecan crust- (1-1/2 c gingersnaps, 1/2 - 3/4 c pecans, 6 T butter and 2 T brown sugar) and put it in a springform pan.  I also added more spices since I like a more pronounced flavor.

Very delicious but a bit too cream-cheesy and not enough pumpkin as-is. I would probably use only half of the second cream cheese package and a full cup of pumpkin puree next time. Also, cheesecake is generally better when fluffier, so I separated the eggs, put the yolks in like it says to put the eggs in, and then whisked the whites until they formed peaks and then folded them into the final batter mixture. Otherwise, AMAZING!

Made this last night and chilled overnight for 24 hours....everyone RAVED about it today!  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had regular pie crusts on hand, and I added a bit more vanilla and cinnamon.  Next time I will try the graham cracker crust.  My guests loved it so much, I had to give the recipe to four people!  I finally found my go-to Thanksgiving dessert....thank you so much for sharing!

Very tasty and easy! I baked mine in a water bath at 350 for 1 hour and cracked the oven door when it was finished. No crackage! I used caramel sauce--- definitely a nice touch!

I made a ground pecan crust instead but this cheesecake is so good. It was easy and turned out perfect, not a single crack. So creamy with just the right amount of pumkin and spice.

This was wonderfull! I loved the flavors together. I did add 2 more packages of cream cheese and a 15oz can of pumkin the second time I made it. The first time it was very small for a cheese cake.I like it big so I just doubled it. Allways a hit at thanksgiving! Thank you for this Wonderfull recipe :)

This is truly the BEST pumpkin cheesecake EVER.  Better than the ones any well-known restaurant would serve and you get to make it yourself!  Just follow the instructions as is and you really cannot go wrong.  Don't be intimidated like I was.  I made my own crust using this site's "Graham Cracker Crust 1" recipe.  Do try it!  20 stars! :)

Excellent! This is an amazing twist on traditional pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dessert, and a great balance if you have family members who aren't so hot on the pumpkin-y ness of regular pie.

Yet another recipe that has become a yearly request for our thanksgiving dinner.  A great seasonal twist on a traditional cheesecake that adds just a little pumpkin flavor to a common dessert.  Very quick and simple to make.

Great!  I've made this several times.  I use a butter cookie crust because I don't care for graham, and mix the two layers instead of separate. Great!

Wonderful recipe - I've had neighbors call me three times to ask if there was any left...big hit!  I'd agree that you could increase the cheesecake layer by about half for more of a cheesecake flavor, but it's also perfect just the way it is!  I also cheated and used pumpkin pie mix, still great results.

This cheesecake is amazing!  My mother and aunt broke out into applause at our family dinner when they found out that I made this cheesecake.  My aunt asked me to make it every year!  I followed the directions almost exactly as written except that I had to bake it longer (45 minutes at 300 degrees in my convection oven). Plus I made my own graham cracker crust instead of using one that was already prepared.

This was good, I think it needs a little more spice, next time I might make it with the libby pumpkin pie filling to see if that gives it more spice.

This cheesecake was wonderful. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out excellent. The only adjustment I made was I added a little more pumpkin to add to the flavour. Overall, delicious! People were fighting over the last piece.

We thought this was good, but was missing something (just can't quite put my finger on it).  It was my first time making cheesecake, so maybe it was just me?  I followed the recipe to the letter, so maybe next time I'll try it with the recommendations of other reviewers.

It was a pretty good recipe. everyone really liked it. But I did make some changes after reading reviews. I doubled the cheesecake part and added more pumpkin. I wanted a thick cheesecake.  I forgot to spray the sides of my pan and it pulled the cake and cracked it.  I also cut the remaining cake in pieces and froze them separately, they thawed well and tasted great 2 weeks later.

I used pumpkin pie mix to aviod having to buy spices, which made the top a little sweeter. By far the best cheesecake I've ever made( well, this is my second) but I was disappointed in the lack of pumpkin-ness. Maybe 3/4 cup of pumpkin instead? Yeah, I got cracks, but they don't bother me...as long as it tastes good. What made it special was that I used a homemade gingersnap crust and served with sliced mangoes. Be careful when blending the cheese...when I stuck the blender in the two blocks, the two beaters broke from their attachment points...man, I wish I had a KitchenAid.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck last year. It was so good and easier than I thought.I was worried since I didnt use the springform pan. It did crack a bit on toop but no one seemed to mind. Definitely give this recipe a try!

This recipe is a welcome change to the typical pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving.  I added crushed gingersnaps as a garnish on top of the whipped cream.  This was very quick and easy recipe and my guests said they loved it.

I thought the intensities of the flavors needed to be kicked up a bit.  The cheesecake didn't have the intense almost-pucker-your-mouth cheesecake flavor, nor did the pumpkin have the rich pumpkin pie taste of holiday pie.   So this recipe did not reach excellence in either taste, but it was still tasty.  I will not make it again, however.  I used room temp cream cheese and eggs.  I increased the amount of vanilla to 1 t. and in addition to the 1/2 cup of sugar, I added 2 T.- 3 T. more sugar.

This turned out pretty well, the guests loved it, but I thought the filling was a little soft. I think next time I'll use a recipe that has just a bit of flour in it, to make it a tiny bit more cakey. I substituted gingerbread crumbs for graham cracker crumbs for the crust.

Excellent pumpkin cheesecake. If you don't have the separate spices, you can use 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead and it tastes great also.

I love this recipe!  I crush the prepared crust and line the bottom of my springform pan with it, then set in a water bath to prevent cracks while baking.  I used prepaired pumpkin pie filling(to make it easier) and cut out the additional spices so the pumkin doesnt overpower the cheesecake layer.  My family requests this every year for holiday meals!

This recipe was alright, I made the adjustments from a reviewer though and made it more cheesecake. I served this for Thanksgiving dinner and people wanted more of a pumpkin pie taste, and this tasted more like cheese cake, was kind of dry too but still had an alright flavor.

This recipe was incredible!!  At first glance it seems intimidating and a bit difficult, but it was super simple. I brought this over to my boyfriend's parents house for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  His mother even asked me to make it for a family event this weekend :)  I made this recipe a bit healthier by using 3 boxes of 1/3 less fat philadelphia cream cheese, substituted splenda granulated for white sugar, egg beaters instead of whole eggs and used sugar free cool whip.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added 1 1/2 cups of the cream cheese mixture instead of 1 cup and baked for 1 hour.  After 1 hour, I turned off the oven and propped the oven door open for another hour to cool and to prevent cracking.  Thank you for a great recipe I'll be making again and again!  Pictures to follow :)

Love this. I use pumpkin that I prepare right out of my garden. Makes such a huge difference in flavor when use home grown pumpkin. I cooked the pumpkin using an easy recipe on this site. Followed everything just as is but always add a little more vanilla to all my recipes. My partner & our families love this. The best way to have this is with caramel drizzled on top with cool whip. YUMMY!

I love this recipe I did it for thanksgiving and it turned out great! Everyone loved it and it was so rich and creamy. I really did the recipe exactly like it was but I did a taste test on the layers before I put the layers together and decided it needed a little more sugar. The only thing I would recommend is that you make sure your pie has time to settle in the fridge cause you cant rush it and it took more than an hour for mine to set

Brought this to Thanksgiving instead of making a traditional pumpkin pie only to have it overlooked by the Mrs. Smiths pumpkin pie that the reletives bring. It was a HUGE hit! I made it in a spring form pan and doubled the pumpkin part to make it a little thicker. Super easy and what a treat! Will definitely add to my arsenal!

This is the easiest cheesecake I have ever made!  I love it! I goofed and mixed everything together. Delicious! The second time, I did it the right way and it was delicious. Either way is great!  I cooked it in a water bath for 30 minutes. Turned off the oven and left it in the oven for one hour. Beautiful! No cracks! Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure what I did wrong here. Followed the recipe exactly. I tried making this for Thanksgiving and it came out "okay" except for the acutal pumpkin layer that was surprisingly light in color and almost too liquid/creamy. Had to bake for an additional 15 mins as it was still too runny.

I was so excited about this recipe but I live in Japan so things are a bit different.  They sell cream cheese (expensive cream cheese) in 200g blocks and this recipe calls for 450g so I only used 2 blocks (400g) instead.  I don't know if that is why, but it was a bit too sweet.  It was very easy to make and I had a good time making it with my 4 year old.  I would like to try it again with less sugar and see how it turns out.  Since there is no canned pumpkin here in Japan (not that I have seen anyway) I usually use fresh kabocha squash however I had a bunch of acorn squash that I had never tried before and my wife was reluctant to use for anything so I used them.  One acorn squash was enough but the color is a little less than desirable.  The acorn squash left some barely noticeable stringy fibers but no one in my group noticed them.

This was delicious and so easy to make!!  My only suggestion is to add a bit more pumpkin in the mix (I really like the pumpkin taste).

Love this recipe and it was my first time making cheesecake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use cloves because I didn't have it.  I made it last week and this week I already am making 2 more.  Yum!

WOW!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and got praises from every single person who tried it!!! They cleaned the plate and it really was outstanding. I followed a reviewer's recommendation: to use pumpkin pie filling rather than pumpkin and the corresponding seasonings. The layers came out so nice and clean. One of the best desserts I've ever made. The same day I was asked to make it again. Will do. Thank you!!!

Fantastic taste!! My husband did comment that it looked more like a torte than a cheesecake in size. It definately wasn't very tall. And I will play with the recipe in regards to the layers, the cheesecake layer was very thin. But overall it was a great tasting cheesecake and satisfied everyones pumpkin craving on Thanksgiving.

I tried this recipe exactly as it reads, and it was fantastic!!  Next time, I'm going to take the advice of another user and try making my own crust of gingersnaps and use more of the plain mix on the bottom for a thicker layer & bake in my springform pan.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!  Thanks for a great new Thanksgiving dessert.

This was fantastic!  I, too, used pumpkin pie filling instead of canned pumpkin.  I also added a dash of pumpkin pie spice for my own taste.  I cooked it for about 50 mins with a pan of water in the bottom of the oven and it turned out perfect.  No cracks at all.  Everyone raved about it and liked it better than the usual cheesecake I make that is double the work.

This was a very good recipe.  I am not a huge fan of pumpkin but this was a delicious cheesecake.  It was a big hit for Thanksgiving and was not overly sweet.   I did do as other reviewers have posted and took out 1 1/2 cups of the cream cheese mixture for the bottom layer.  Then for the second layer added a bit more pumpkin puree (maybe 1/3 cup).  It turned out great.   After cooking, let cool in the oven for a while, then with the oven door cracked just a bit.  I did not have any problems with the cheesecake cracking.

Absolutely wonderful!!! I followed the advice of SOUTHERNBELLE0908 and used 3 8oz packages of cream cheese instead of 2, added 1/2 cup of sour cream (Fold the sour cream in after adding the eggs),increased the pumpkin puree to 1 8oz can and added a bit more nutmeg & Cinnamon. Bake in a water bath at 350 for 1 hr (till the middle jiggles like jello), turn off oven, prop the door open and let the cheesecake sit for another hour then refrigerate. Use a 10in springform pan and shortbread cookie crust. Use  caramel sauce & pour over the cheesecake. You will not regret it if you make this recipe it is amazing!!!

yum yum yum!!!  I made this for thanksgiving and it was the one dessert everyone ate and they ignored all the cakes and pies!!  It was gone by the end of the night.  I made a gingersnap crust but that was the only thing i changed.  Next time i will increase the recipe by 50% because it didn't make as much as i was expecting.  Also, i found that the spices in this recipe were dead on.  It didn't taste bland at all to me.  I guess if you prefer spicier pumpkin then maybe....

This is a new seasonal favorite!!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I put it in a 9" springform pan - very easy.  I put a small glass dish of water in the oven rather than a water bath and it turned out a great. No cracks on the top either!  It is not as sweet as I expected, so I may put caramel sauce on top next time to serve.

I normally make cheese cakes in a springform pan.  This was SO easy and quick.  We had about 5 pies this Thanksgiving and this one was the first to be goggled up.  I wipped it up the night before in no time.  I did use the graham cracker premade crust.  However I used over 1 C. of the Libby's Pumpkin Pie filling only added a dash of extra cinnamon.  I also bought the individual size premade graham crusts and and I got 1 full size pie and 5 small crusts (so the kids got their own pie) They thought that was so cool.  I baked the small ones for 35 min. but the 9" pie took 55 min.  I used Hershey's Dulce de Leche carmel topping and drizzled it over the pie and then topped with whipped topping and a pinch of cinnamon for show.  It looked like it came from a fancy restaurant and it was so good!  This is defintly a keeper!  I had to send out the recipe to several relatives.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! We really enjoyed it. I did adapt it to fit a springform pan. I used the Graham Cracker Crust 1 from this site. I made one batch of cream cheese, white sugar, vanilla and eggs as written in the recipe for the bottom layer. Then I made another batch and added the pumpkin and spices to it for the top layer. For a pinch I used 1/4 teaspoons. I accidentally added 1/4 tsp of ginger. I used 3/4 can of pumpkin, but next time I think I should use the whole can. I also made sure that my eggs, cream cheese, and mixing bowl were at room temperature. I baked it at 250 for 90 minutes, turned off oven and opened the door. I let it sit for an hour, and it came out beautiful! No cracks. No water bath. I let it cool completely before I put it in the fridge. I chilled overnight. Don't forget to run a knife around the edge of the pan before taking springform side off. It turned out very thick and rich, so serve it in small pieces. (They can always get seconds.) It is great for serving a crowd. For Thanksgiving it took care of my cheesecake and pumpkin pie craving.

This was my first cheesecake and my first thanksgiving (I am from the UK). An Aunt was bring her famous pumpkin pie so I made this as a second option. I added a tiny bit more pumpkin, about a 1/3 cup. I didn't even get a slice of the cheesecake as it went so quickly and the pumpkin pie only had one slice taken! It got rave reviews even from people who are not cheesecake fans. A definate tradition now!

I LOVED this cheesecake! I made it for Thanksgiving and what a hit. I took the person's advice that used the pumkin pie filling instead of trying to get all the spices. This worked out really well but don't forget you have to bake it for about 30 min longer inorder for it to set. Also I suggest you pour more of the plain cheesecake in the crust before making the pumpkin layer. If not there isn't much of a contrast.

Pretty darn tasty! I managed to not *quite* finish baking it in the center, but it wasn't runny--a bit like pudding pie. It was all around lovely, though I think I"ll make the non-pumpkin layer bigger next time just for the sake of symmetry.

if you follow this recipe you might have a little extra filling but thats ok. i made 3 pies. first pie i used 3 packages of 8 ounce creame cheese and 1/3 cup of sour cream and i had extra filling so i filled half of another pie shell. on the first crust i bought a pre made graham craker crust but drizzled it with butter and put crushed giner snaps on it. then i did the regular layer then then pumpkin layer..cooked it for about 45 mintures in a water bath. came out a little undercooked but once i put it in the fridge good to go. i sprinkled graham cracker and ginger snap crumb on the top. for the second pie i used a vanialla wafter crust with the same butter drizzle graham cracker and gingersnap bottom. i reduced the amout of cream cheese to 2 packages and added a little less sourcream. after i did the regular layer of the cake i did a think layer of the crust before i put the pumpkin layer one it. i had a little extra too so i topped of the 3rd pie from the early extra filling. i again sprinkled the mixture of the crust and inside layer on top and covered with homemade whip cream and sprinkled pumpkin spice on it. the 3rd pie was just pumpkin cheesecake from the leftover filling with a chocolate crust. i cooked the 2nd too about 45 mintues and they were just right. and then i let them cool on the rack and then put them in the frige until serving time. my family ate some of the first pie, i gave away the chocolate crus

This is always a huge hit at the holidays. It's been called "epic" by some co-workers who experienced it at a potluck.
I don't change a thing - follow the recipe to the T. It's perfect!

This cheesecake is great!  My whole family who doesn't really care for anything with pumpkin loves this pie.  I followed the recipe but increased the vanilla essence to 1 teapsoon, increased the sugar and used Libbys pre mix pumpkin and it turned out great. Wonderful recipe.

Love this recipe!  I use a little less pumpkin and keep more just the plain cheesecake.  But, that is just my preference.

I wanted something quick that used a purchased graham crust; I made it pretty much by the recipe. My mom and husband loved this and it was gone the next day. I would have preferred the pumkpin to be mixed instead of layered, but we enjoyed it.

It was a hit! Made it for my husband's birthday cake on Halloween.  He loved the layers. For the crust I used a chocolate premade crust, but dumped it out into my springform pan. Worked great. What a time saver!

Made this last year. Perfect holiday cheesecake. I used 3/4 cup pumpkin, added 1/4 cup of sour cream and a touch of extra spices. Very easy and everyone loved it. I'm making it again this year.

This one is a keeper! I made it for the first time last Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, so much in fact, that they requested me to make it this year too. The recipe has amazing flavor. I will definitely be making this one for many years to come.

Absolutely delicious. I changed a few things at the suggestions of other reviewers below (e.g. using a bit more sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie mix), and it turned out fabulous! 

Note: I also did use a water bath and let the cheesecake sit for an hour in the oven afterwards at the suggestion of others, and I had no cracking whatsoever.

Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is great! It was my first time making cheesecake, and although you can definately tell by looking at it (it cracked and sunk), it still tastes great! I bought E.D. Smith's pumpkin pie filling and it tastes great without the extra work. I will definately make this again.

This is by far one of the best and easiest cheesecake recipes I've tried.  I've made this for a couple of different work functions and everyone loved it!  Even now, I already have people requesting it for this upcoming autumn.  The only thing I changed slightly, is I added a bit more cheesecake to the bottom layer - fantastic recipe!

This recipe is fabulous.  I made it for a party and my best friend who hates cheesecake asked for the recipe.  Close friends are beginning to ask for this as their birthday cake.  As I have made it though I find that I care for more spice than the recipe calls for.  I include ginger, cloves, and nutmeg when mixing in the pumpkin.

Another hit!  I use a gingersnap crust (food processed ginger snaps, white and brown sugar and butter - cook for 5 minutes).  the gingersnap crust is a must with this cheesecake.

I am not a cheesecake fan and I love this recipe! My husband is a cheesecake lover and he thinks this recipe is very very good! I've made it at least 5 times so far for different people and it's a hit!

Wow, good.  Sweet n' spicy, I loved it.  Makes a lot of mix so if you wanted to make a deep dish 10 inch you could.  Used more pumpkin mix than called for to give more flavor, also used more of the spices than called for, for same reason.  Could try less sugar, but this amount was very good.  Next time I will make this with homemade whipped cream, but ran out of time this time and used Cool Whip.  ***Warning: only problem I had was I was surprised by the amount of pumpkin-haters I came across at my Thanksgiving dinner.  And they equally did not like this, so be aware.

My 6-year-old daughter made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit.  2 people even asked her to make another one for them.

This was excellent!  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  I did make a few modifications to make it 'lighter'.  I used 1 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 1 8 oz. 1/3 cream cheese.  I also used 1/4 cup splenda blend and a 9 oz. reduced fat graham cracker crust.  As other reviewers stated, I too usd 1 cup of Libby's pumpkin and a tsp of pumpkin spice.  Great recipe and w/o a lot of fat.  We surely enjoy...thank you!

Not that this recipe needs any more rave reviews than it already has....but, I love it.  It is very creamy but not too rich.  The pumpkin flavor is definetly there but it is not too overwhelming.  The two layers of pumpkin cheesecake and cheesecake leaves a beautiful presentation.  This recipe has become one of our thanksgiving traditions.

I used  pre-made graham cracker crust, (3) 8 oz containers of  fat free cream cheese, with half for the cream cheese mixture (also added 2 extra tbsp sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tsp cinnamon before splitting it off)  and half with canned pumpkin. I took off a star because I think with an extra 8 oz of cream cheese you need to adjust the pumpkin (which I didn't). This made it REALLY cream cheesey. I would use 1 cup of the pumpkin pie filling next time. Also, don't try sneaking a bite before it's been refrigerated overnight. I did and honestly it tasted terrible. Next day it was WAY tastier! Easy recipe, thanks for sharing!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was such a big hit that it was requested again for Christmas dinner. Make this low carb by using splenda and pecan crust from this site.

Excellent. This was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner. It replaced the pumpkin pie and was requested for next year! I made the following changes: I used a homemade graham cracker crust, used canned pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and I baked it for 50 minutes. I also left it in the oven to cool after it was done baking.

This was so easy to make and my boyfriend loved it!!  Cheesecake and Pumpkin go amazing together.  I took the reviewers advice and used the pumpkin pie filling.  However, i still added a little bit of Nutmeg and Cinnamon to the recipe.  :0)

This was really yummy. I gave it only 4 stars because I found it didn't have that much of a pumpkin taste. It very well may have been my pumpkin puree.

So easy for such a great reward. I used extra cream cheese and pumpkin as per other reviewers and had enough to put 
1 1/2 cups of the plain cheesecake on the bottom so the two layers can really be seen. Everyone raved about it.

Family and co-workers all loved this one. It's become my favorite new dessert recipe! I had a request for "real" whipped topping at the last party I brought it to. It was a worthwhile bonus if you have the time to make both the cake and the topping.

Fantastic if you want to wow everyone at that upcoming get together or christmas party. I made one and took it to work and everyone just ate it up! It's easy enough to make on a work night. I left out the cloves cause I didn't have any. Much, Much better than plain ole pumpking pie!

I did it exactly the way SOUTHERNBELLE0908 suggests except I just had the carmel sauce drizzled on top after serving on a plate instead of all over the top. It turned out awsome I loved the shortbread crust  I thought it tasted perfect with the pumpkin flavor. Also the sourcream, extra creamcheese and spices made it creamy and delicious with tons of flavor. I had tons of compliments on it Thanks for all the wonderful tips SOUTHERNBELLE0908.

I adjusted the spices to my taste and it turned out great.  I also like the fact that it does not make a huge cheesecake like some other recipes that call for 3 or 4 packages of cream cheese.

This cheesecake was SO good! I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! It was so easy to make too--I did make some adjustments after reading previous reviews.  Instead of the plain pumpkin puree and the spices I simply used 1 cup of pumpkin pie filling. Using a whole cup made it taste more like pumpkin and it was out of this world! I will definitely make this one again.

I don't even like pumpkin pie generally, but this was tasty.  I liked it better than my home made apple pie that everyone raves about.  It must have put at least 5 pounds on me but they were worth it.

Nice change from standard pumpkin pie. I added a lil more pumkin puree to the cream cheese for a richer color. Good enough that my mom asked for the recipe and my DF was bummed we didnt have much left overs:)

I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing and it came out delicious. Be aware this is a more creamy version of cheesecake, but we loved it. My husband loves cheesecake and it just wouldn't be thanksgiving without pumpkin pie. So put them both together and (waolah) pumpkin cheesecake. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Really nice recipe.  You get all the rich pumpkin pie flavor mixed with the sweet, creamy creme cheese filling.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first thing people tried even before the regular pumpkin pie, pecan pie or cookies.

Awesome recipe.  I used a generous amount of pumpkin pie spice and also added it to the cheesecake layer.  I used extra in the bottom cheesecake layer as others suggested and used sour cream as stated in the first review.  I used a pie crust but next time I will double it and use a spring form pan.  The layers need to be thicker but there just isn't enough room in a pie crust.

Big hit at husband's office party.  Used 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves for spice.  Lovely with chopped  pecans sprinkled on top.  (No cracks with 1 Tsp cornstarch added with sugar).

All I can say is... "whoa".  This was too delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving exactly as stated and it came out perfect.  The taste is exceptional.  The perfect mix between a traditional cheesecake and pumpkin pie. Thanks for this amazing recipe.  I have to make it every year from here on out, I've been told.

everyone loved this, though personally, I think it should have had more of the pumpkin filling in it, tasted more cream cheese than I would have liked, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it, so it gets a 5!

This was AWESOME! My whole family loved it! I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the cream cheese and added a few extra spices. This will be a regular around my house!

Double the cheesecake layer & it will be a 5 star recipe.  This pumpkin cheesecake & the sourcream lemon pie was the hit for Thanksgiving this year.  We had never had so many compliments.  Tons of pies & none left over for the next day.  If you make the sour cream lemon pie, double the lemon.

Cheesecake is one of my alltime favorites, so this recipe was the best!  I am not much of a baker, so I was a little nervous when I first decided to attempt this for Thanksgiving but it was a definite hit.  Very simple (even for a non-baker like myself) and tastes just like cheesecake you would order in a restaurant.  I will definitely make this again--you can't go wrong with this one!!

This was awsome!  I made it with a healthy graham craker crust recipe from this site, and used half low fat cream cheese to decrease the fat a little.  I think it turned out wonderful, thank you for this recipe.

I am not personally a huge cheesecake fan, but this was pretty good.  Took it to a company Thanksgiving meal and it was gone in no time!  Everyone loved it.  The layers were very pretty and it had a perfect consistency.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a fan of cheesecake (I made this for my sister) but this recipe won me over!  I followed others advice with putting 1.5 cups of filling instead of 1 cup for the first layer and it was beautiful when cut.  Also, I probably used about half of a 16oz can of pumpkin puree.  Then, baking in a water bath was a good idea for this type of recipe.

My sister-in-law made this for dessert the other night and it was amazing! I tried it for Thanksgiving and it wasn't as good. The center needed to set up a bit more. I think that I just needed to bake it a little bit longer. Neither of us used the whipped topping. It really wasn't needed. Delicious without it. I'll try again for sure. Great recipe. Thanks

I made this cheesecake the other day for Thanksgiving as a fun alternative to regular Pumpkin Pie, and it was gone before the regular pie was touched!  Went over very well- very light and fluffy for a cheesecake.  I added a teaspoon more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe required, and it gave it a nice flavorful bite to the pumpkin flavor.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Absolutely divine!  It was fluffy and light and had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect! Disappeared within minutes on Thanksgiving.

Excellent cheesecake!  I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I can't ever leave a recipe well enough alone. :o)  I made my own crust using cinnamon graham crackers & pressed it into a 10-in springform pan.  I also added an extra 4 oz. cream cheese and an extra egg to the batter, plus an extra 1/2 c. pumpkin to the pumpkin layer, in addition to using pumkin pie filling with extra spices rather than just pumpkin puree.

My cheesecake cracked something fierce (didn't have anything big enough to stick it in for baking in a water bath), so I ended up making Cinnamon Cream Syrup (from this site) and pouring over the top to disguise the cracks.  It looked a little bland, so I crushed some butter toffees and sprinkled the crumbs over all.  The cheescake was spectacular, and the added toppings were just guilding the lily, so to speak.  This recipe (or my version of it) will be on my holiday menu from now on!

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had!  I followed the advice of some here and used 3 bricks of cheescake, plus 1/4 cup more sugar.  I also toasted some pecan pieces in a saute pan with sugar, and sprinkled half of them over the bottom of the pie crust before adding the cheesecake mixture, then the rest of them over the top layer. We were also baking a pumpkin pie, so I had to remove this from the oven right away and let it cool on the stove top.  I didn't bake it in a water bath, either, and was worried it would crack badly.  Despite these two things, it hardly cracked at all.  Everyone loved it.  I'll be making it for everyone for holiday gifts.  Thanks!

Can I just say....wonderful!! My brother-in-law said that it was by far the best pie he had this Thanksgiving, and someone else had made a pumpkin cheesecake too, and he liked mine better!! It was very creamy, and good. I made it mostly for my husband. He loves cheesecake, and he loved this one too!

This cheesecake was rich but not so rich that I couldn't eat more!  It had just enough pumpkin flavor and spice to feel festive.  I am not usually a big fan of pumkpin but this was great!  Without the cool whip it probably would have been a 4 and a half star recipe, so don't forget it!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was soooo good. I was surprised at how easy it was. I used pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin and I baked it in a water bath at 350 for 45 minutes. It came out perfect and everyone loved it!

This was my first time making cheesecake and it came out great!!  I did only bake it for 35 minutes and even though it didn't look done I decided to take other reviewers' advice and take it out anyway. After it cooled I could tell that it was definitely done. I made two pies and they were the only pies touched last night at Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely be making it again!

I made this cheesecake the day before thanksgiving using the pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree.  Turned out great.  Guests loved it and it was so easy to make.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very good! I did what a number of the reviews said and added 1/2 cup of sour cream, did 1.5 cups of the white for the bottom, and doubled the pumpkin and spices, and added ginger (1/2 tsp).  Very tasty!

Okay. Could use more spice. The only thing that saved kicked this pie up a notch was a homemade graham cracker crust and caramel sauce.

This was absolutely one of the greatest deserts I have ever made! I made a mistake and forgot to add the eggs, so I had to scoop out the batter from the pie shell and mix them all together so it wasn't layered. Everyone loved it! I will make this one over and over again. YUMMY.

This was a HIT at our Thanksgiving table tonight!  Like other reviewers, I added more pumpkin then the recipe called for (started w/ 1 cup and then added more till I could really taste it).  I cooked it the night before Thanksgiving in a water bath and let cool in the oven before putting in the frig.  It was PERFECT today!  The pieces did not cut perfectly but the taste was too die for, and that's all that counts w/ family!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good - used a ginger cookie crust (Anna's Ginger Thins - crust was awesome!) and doubled everything and used a 9" springform pan.  I basically split the batter in half and used half plain for the bottom layer and mixed the pumpkin and spices into the other half, and got two perfect thick layers.  Took about 50 minutes to bake, then turned the oven off and left it until cool.  Very attractive and tasted good too (I even used low-fat cream cheese)

I served this dessert today after Thanksgiving dinner. It was a big hit. I received so many compliments on how fantastic it tasted. It's hard to believe something so easy to make could be that wonderful. The only thing I left out was the pinch of ground cloves only because I did'nt have any, but I don't think it affected the outcome at all. Thank you Stephanie for sharing your recipe and making our holiday dessert extra special.

This is the best thanksgiving dessert I have ever made by far. I made the following adjustments: per the directions on the crust packaging, I brushed the crust with one egg and baked by itself for about 5 minutes at 425. This gave the crust an even richer taste. Per other comments here, I used a pumpkin pie filling can rather than pumpkin puree. I still did add some additional ground cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon, about 1/2 t each, and will actually do more next time, I like the spice. My cooking time was significantly longer than the 35-40 minutes listed in the recipe: I used the "jiggle test" until it acted like set jello, and that took at least 55 minutes (I was cooking 2 pies in a small oven). Another reviewer here suggested turning off the oven at the end of the cooking time, and slightly propping the door open to stop the cheesecake from cracking. I have no idea if that made a difference, but I did that for about 45 minutes and it did not crack at all. Instead of whipped topping I made the glaze in the recipe from this site called "Apple Harvest Pound Cake with Caramel Glaze" with lots of added cinnamon and put it on the cheesecake after the 45 minute in-oven cooling period. That was a perfect addition, it really made it a 3-layer cake. I recommend serving this cake straight from the refrigerator, it is great very cold.

This is the best thanksgiving dessert I have ever made by far. I made the following adjustments: per the directions on the crust packaging, I brushed the crust with one egg and baked by itself for about 5 minutes at 425. This gave the crust an even richer taste. Per other comments here, I used a pumpkin pie filling can rather than pumpkin puree. I still did add some additional ground cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon, about 1/2 t each, and will actually do more next time, I like the spice. My cooking time was significantly longer than the 35-40 minutes listed in the recipe: I used the "jiggle test" until it acted like set jello, and that took at least 55 minutes (I was cooking 2 pies in a small oven).

This does have good flavor if you want something on the light side.  It is not a heavy decadent cheese pie.

I used the store bought shortbread keebler pie crust but I felt that there was not enough crust. I would have liked 3 times more pie crust. I used 3 8oz cream cheese with 1/2 sour cream folded in and it was yummy but I didn't bake it longer to account for the extra ingredients and also the top of this pie needs something other then just whip cream.

Oh my god---this cheesecake was AWESOME!!!!! I followed it to a T and it turnes out perfectly. The hardest part was waiting the 3 hours for it to come out of the fridge, but it was well worth the wait. Even my 9 y.o. son who isn't keen on either pumpkin pie or cheesecake absolutly loved it and couldn't get enough of it. I'm definitly making this for Thanksgiving.

This is pretty good, although I didn't think it was quite as good as some of the other reviews seemed to think. Its a nice cheesecake, not too light, not too heavy. But I'm not sure its better than having a good pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving/Halloween!

Delicious recipe. Made it for dinner (home made pot pies) with the in-laws who "LOVED" it. I kicked up the spices quite a bit. I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also had to bake for about 5 extra min. Well worth it! Going to make it again today for dessert.

Oh boy, did we ever love this one! My 3-year old 'helped' me make it as it was very simple to make. I can't believe how good it tastes! I allowed my son to measure out the spices so I would say they were easily on the heavy side and it still tastes fabulous. Definitely a keeper, thanks so much!

i was disappointed in this dish. i followed some of the suggestions regarding sour cream and pumpkin pie filling that other members suggested. the cheesecake looked great but tasted ho-hum. it just needed a bit more spice or oomph to make this fantastic

Not bad, but i've tried better. I'll give it another chance but tweaking it a little bit. Maybe i'll try adding some rum to the filling or something. Thanks anyways.

Not bad, but i've tried better. I'll give it another chance but tweaking it a little bit. Maybe i'll try adding some rum to the filling or something. Thanks anyways.

I discovered this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and I love it!! I also made this for Christmas for various family members, and it has quickly become my family's favorite holiday dessert.

My teenage boys said this was "Ok".  The younger one loves pumpkin cheesecake in season from Olive Garden, so I made this for him.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly firm with no cracking. The taste was smooth and kind of bland, not very pumpkiny.  Also, my layers didn't turn out distinct, like the photo, even though I took care to layer them.

I took the advice of others and used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree. I also added about 3 tbs more pumpkin than it called for. I baked it for at least 55 minutes and it still ended up a little under cooked in the middle but if I'd baked it longer the outside would've been too done. I'm not sure what went wrong. It tasted good though.

This was absolutely fantastic! If you really love pumpkin, add in extra. The first time I made it I didn't think it had enough pumpkin. I brought it to a large event around Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! It was the only dessert that was completely gone.

I made this for a Thanksgiving bake sale at my office.  It was a huge success.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I did not have cloves or nutmeg so I added a little extra cinnamon.  It was great!

Excellent recipe. Did everything exactly as is, except instead of cloves I used allspice. This was my first attempt at making a pumpkin cheesecake, and also my first time even tasting one. Delicious! And simple. Will definately make again!

This was a nice suprise.  The pumkin layer cuts the richness of the cheesecake nicely.  It's a good compromise for those who don't care for traditional pumpkin pie.  (that would be me!)

Very good recipe. I followed directions but had to leave mine in the oven for about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. This was a hit on Thanksgiving. I will be saving this one.

This is good, and my guests liked it. The texture of the cheescake resembles a jello cheesecake mix more than the dense, rich cheesecake you get at restaurants though.

A great compromise for a tradional favorite and way too easy!!!!   Very creamy, very tasty.  I added two heaping teaspoons more of pumpkin. Next time I will add a little more for a more pumpkiny taste.  Also I would love to try the ginersnap crust for something a little different. Otherwise AWESOME!!!!

This cheesecake was a HUGE hit at my Thanksgiving meal!  I made a homemade Graham Cracker crust rather than using a store bought one, it was much better.  I would make this again for sure!

This had a very good flavor but I was expecting it to be a little less soft like a regular cheescake or pumpkin pie. It is more soft like a mousse. I may have just undercooked it.

I added extra pumpkin and spices as recommended by other reviewers and skipped the whipped topping.  Its turned out great every time I've made it and won a contest at my work.

I've made this twice for people who thought my only cooking knowledge was pouring milk into a cereal bowl. Then after my husband brags that I made this they look astonished! It really is an excellent substitute for traditional pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. I did use pumpkin pie filling, adding a little more than recommended for more pumpkin flavor. I would spring for the brand name cream cheese though, as when I used a generic the second time I had lumps that would not go away.

I made this recipe for christmas and I loved it! It was very simple to make and didn't take a lot of time. I recommed making two, because the pie went very quickly (no seconds =[) Next time I make it though I am going to add more pumpkin for added flavor. And make some homemade nutmeg whipped cream to top it off, cause regular whipped cream didn't do it justice.

I love this recipe.  It's easy, delicious, and there is very little clean-up!  Everyone loves it!  We usually drizzle a little caramel over the top but we also love it with whipped cream or french vanilla whipped cream.

Awesome!  I made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I did it in a 9 inch springform and 1 1/2ed the recipe.  I read the reviews and added some extra spice and a little bit of pumpkin pie spice and it was perfect.  I will make this again I'm sure.  Next time though I may use the pre-made graham cracker crust since it would be faster.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

I thought this was really delicious and a nice change from pumpkin pie. I increased the spices for my spice-loving audience. My  only quibble was that I couldn't really taste the pumpkin; maybe adapt the recipe to use a cup or more of pumpkin puree?

Turned out beautifully! My layers were very defined and everyone enjoyed this pie with a huge squirt of Reddi Whip on top! The noly thing I'll change next time id I will make a gingersnap crust-that would go wonderfully with this cheesecake. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This is the most amazing pie!!  I had never made a pumpkin pie until this one.  I do not really like the taste of pumpkin; however, this was one of the most delicious pies I have ever eaten.  I also used the pumpkin pie mix, and it was so incredibly easy.  I took it to a fall festival at church, and everyone said that it was the best one there.

This is a perfect Thanksgiving/Fall dessert.  In search for a recipe that was not overly sweet, it hit the spot.  I made a double batch as I had two dinners in a row.  Per other reviewers' advice, I  increased the bottom cream cheese layer  to balance the flavours.  Also substituted splenda for the sugar.  Top with 'real whipped cream' spray for a nice presentation and ease!  I was surprised at the compliments from guests!  Will be making this again this weekend for the next dinner party.

Thanks for this recipe, I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law "told" me I was bringing it for Christmas.  I also made it for treat day at work and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks again!

Delicious!  My son, who can be quite picky at times, loved it so much I had to make him another one.  I served this at Thanksgiving and my relatives loved the variation from regular pumpkin pie.  Next time, I would like to try a gingersnap crust.  I did use more than one cup of the batter for the bottom layer, which I would suggest, but other than that I would not change a thing about the recipe.

I used squash puree for this due to an error in purchasing, added a little more spices and it came out good.

Taste was great but the layers were not apparent whcih I think woudl have added to the visual appeal. Perhaps it was something; the first layer sort of absorbed teh second when it was added.

This is a wonderful cake! So simple to make and so good to eat. I took the recommendation of others and made the cream cheese layer a little thicker and it turned out fabulous! My friend said she could die happy eating this cake. =) Thanks for sharing it with us!

I tried this recipe to take to my parents for the holiday. Everyone loved it! I also served it with a side of "gingerbread" ice cream and it was a delight.
