These are really easy to make, very festive and are a nice balance of salty and sweet.  I'd probably add a little more peanut butter next time, but I really like the honey nut cereal in these.

I made these for a Halloween treat and they were simple and had a good balance of salty and sweet flavors.  I would advise to eat within a few days as the cereal became stale.

Such an awesome and fun treat for both kids and adults!
I did add a lot more peanut butter...about 1/4 cup.  Made it for Halloween and will again for Thanksgiving.

These little bars were gobbled up in one evening by my husband and two teen daughters.  I did add more peanut butter (probably close to 1/4 cup) which made them a little soft for cutting into bars, but the taste was spot on.  I didn't have candy corn, so I topped it with the peanuts, M&Ms, and mini peanut butter cups from Trader Joe's.  This is a great recipe for using up your leftover candy.  I'll be making these again over the weekend for when their friends come over.  Quick and easy treat.

I really like this variation on a crispy rice bar!  The only change I made was to double the peanut butter to 2 tablespoons, which seemed to be just right.  Very festive and tasty!
