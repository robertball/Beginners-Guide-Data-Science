This cake is good.  In order to cut some fat and calories, I only used 1/2 cup butter and added 1/2 applesauce to make up for it.  I also cut the sugar in half to only 1/2 cup.  I didn't have buttermilk, so used light sour cream instead.  I also used mini chocolate chips and left out the nuts and coconut.  I still thought it was yummy and even my picky boys ate it.

Oh my. Soooo good. My husband and I can't get enough of this. We left out the coconut and walnuts and it still turned out beautiful--great flavor and texture. After mashing 3 bananas, I had a quarter cup more than is called for but I used it all anyway. Worked great. This is a new family favorite! Thank you.

Turned out great!! Knowing a teen boy would scarf all of this down fast, I made a few healthy subs...1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup light margarine, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 1/2 cup non-fat yogurt, 1/2 cup ww flour, 1 cup old fashioned oats and I used milk choc chips (what I had on hand).  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

This was really yummy! I used half the butter, and replaced the other half with fat free vanilla yogurt to lower the fat a bit.  I only had a cup of chocolate chips so I used the in the cake part and sprinkled brown sugar on the top instead.  It was really good and gave it a crunchy-sticky topping.  Next time I will sprinkle the chocolate chips and the brown sugar on it. Will definitley make again!

Phenomenal!  Such a moist and delicious cake.  My alterations were minor, and only because I lacked 2 ingredients.  Instead of buttermilk, I used regular milk and a splash of lemon juice to curdle.  Instead of walnuts I used sliced almonds, which were fabulous in the moist cake and mixed very nicely with the coconut.  Finally, I added about 1/4 cup of milled flaxseed just to give it a little healthy kick.  mmmmmm!

this is a very good recipe. i like the chocolate chips in it, but the added chocolate chips on top is too much for my taste. definatly will be making this again, without the extra chocolate on top.

This is a great cake for a twist to the traditional banana bread.  I made this minus the coconut and nuts and it was super!  Yummy!

This was seriously horrible.  I expected so much from it.  I think it just had too many ingredients/conflicting flavors.

Moist, nice flavor and perfect for a simple summer dessert.   Perfect as is, but I love nuts and coconut so may double both the next time.

I altered the recipe a little bit.  Like others, I only used 3/4 cup of butter.  I had four bananas on their way out, so I used them all.  I was running short on chocolate chips, so I added cocoa powder to the dry mixture.  And, I'm out of nuts.

In the end, they are delicious.  I love this recipe!

Absolutely delish!  Used dark choc chips so it wouldn't be so sweet. If you want to turn it out onto a wire rack for cooling or icing, do not put choc chips on top. Will be making this for son's birthday cake and icing it with lemon creamcheese icing.  What a suprise it will be when it's cut - not the usual choc or vanilla cake inside!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I only had one large ripe banana and I only sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top and then, as another reviewer suggested, I added a light sprinkling of brown sugar to the top.  It was delicious!!!  An excellent recipe that I would definitely make again or bring to an office or coffee meeting. Thanks for sharing!

This was soooo good! I was looking for a different way to use ripe bananas and found this recipe. I made it as is, only omitting the nuts, as we're not fans.  All of my children loved it and so did my husband and I. Moist, flavorful and delicious! Will be adding this to my repertoire:)

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  It has an interesting texture and all the flavors compliment each other.  Good body and makes a good lunch box cake.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I cut the recipe in half and used a 8 x 8 pan. Still used the 350 degree oven but left it in for 40 minutes. I skipped the coconut and added a little more walnut.

Very tasty.  Felt like baking so I made this and took it to work.  Subbed Crisco for the butter (just wanted to use up some baking sticks), and also used milk with lime juice, pecans, and milk chocolate chips instead of the listed ingredients.  My guinea pigs (co-workers) enjoyed it and I was even asked for the recipe.

Really moist cake. Great flavor. We couldnt wait for it to really cool from the over seeing it smelled so good! We followed the recipe exactly, well maybe added a bit more banana but that is because we had so many ripe ones!

I halved the recipe, omitted the nuts and coconut. Added in just a few tablespoons more of the oats. Baked in an 11x7 pan. I didn't eat it. But my husband said it was good. Looks really moist, although he would prefer less chocolate chips next time, unless they were milk chocolate. lol

This cake was just ok. It wasn’t bad in any way, but it wasn’t a cake that left you wanting a second slice. I expect more from a dessert than what this delivered.

Outstanding, easy little cake — I whipped it up after work for a weeknight dessert. I halved the recipe and baked it in a square pan, used pecans instead of walnuts, and left off the chocolate chips on top. I’ll be making this one again and again!

A deliciously dense snacking cake.  I made it for my teen boys who have bottomless appetites so I didn't alter the sugar or butter....because frankly they need the calories (they are very active).  I love the texture and taste of this cake.  The only downside is that I am soo tempted to eat it myself!

This is great for when you have those extra bananas, and you don't feel like making banana bread and kids love it. And it's easy and quick. I've done this for cookies, i just use a coffee grinder to grind the oats up a bit and i had more bananas so used a little less butter. Like some of the alterations some people made, so will be trying flax seed. And use about half the amount of coconut (have some coconut haters.) This is one of my favorite recipes, and love that you can play around with ingredients.

I just pulled this recipe out of a binder I have, basically full of recipes I printed from allrecipes like a million years ago (this one says November 2009). I have only made it once, in 2009 apparently, but today (Feb 2018!) I made it again. I halved the recipe and made it in to muffins which turned out beautifully. The coconut is a nice addition to my regular banana oat recipe, which is quite similar to this one. I skipped the nuts as these will go to school.

This was very good, and I will definitely make again.  If I would make one minor change, it would be to put fewer chocolate chips on the top.

So good! I served in my seniors coffee time, and it was a hit!  A few additions, deletions, it did not hurt it a bit!  I sprinkled a touch of brown sugar on top to add the finishing touch!

I made this today abd it is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I used sour cream instead of buttermilk, and sprinkled coconut along with chocolate chips on top. So yummy! I used 3 bananas which came to about 1 1/4 cups. The house smelled amazing while it baked! It only took 28 minutes to bake in a 9 x 11 pan. This one is a winner!! The pic is only half the cake. Can't upload the whole pic for some reason.

I ended up with some ripe bananas after being away from home for a few days and I wanted to make a snacking cake.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I subbed 1/2 c coconut oil for half the butter.  I didn't have buttermilk but I always have buttermilk powder so I used it (2T plus 1/2 c water).  I used mini morsels and only about 1/2 the amount called for.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan and didn't want chocolate to overpower every thing else.  I ended up baking this for a full 40 minutes which was a bit too much as it is slightly dry.  My fault.  I'm glad there is an actual banana measurement instead of a banana count because they vary in size so much.  I used three which was just a bit more than 1 cup.  I like the addition of coconut and nuts (I used pecans).  I will make again.  Thanks!

I wanted to lighten and make it healthier. I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 applesauce, whole wheat pastry flour, truvia sugar blend. I then baked in a bundt pan sprayed with non stick spray and sprinkled with sugar in the raw. I also left out the chocolate chips due to personal preference. Thank you for a great recipe to use up ripe bananas.

This recipe was so good. My family loved it. It was a nice change from the regular banana bread. I didn't add the nuts or coconut. When the cake came out of the oven I did get a knife and spread the chocolate chips over the cake, like a frosting.I also used soymilk instead of buttermilk and it turned out great. Thanks for this great recipe.

What a great recipe. My only changes were that I used soy milk, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips, and extra coconut flakes and banana. So tasty!

My gang loved this recipe!!  I didn't use real butter, used Country crock light spread, also used splenda in place of the sugar. And I used milk and 1 tsp of lemon juice for the buttermilk, and for the chocolate chips, 1 1/2 cups.

My family really liked this cake.  It is sooo good, very moist.  But I did make a lot of changes.  First we can't have dairy.  So I used soymilk and added a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to sour it. And of course non-dairy chocolate chips.  I only used a little more than 3/4 cup in the cake itself and none on top.  I also used only 1/3 cup coconut.  Instead of eggs I used eggbeaters.  One cup of butter was WAY to much so I used 4 TBSP + 3/4 cup of applesauce to make up for the rest of the lost butter.  I completely left out the walnuts.  I know what your thinking, this is a completely different cake, well yes but it still has the same feel as the original.  I really enjoyed this cake and cant wait to make it again.

This is awesome and has all the things in it that I love.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips and will probably only use 1 cup the next time.  I increased the coconut to 3/4 cup and added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract.  I also left out the nuts since many of the people I know can't eat nuts.  I also used shortening instead of the butter.  Wonderful tasting treat!

Wonderful, full of flavor.  I can't keep my husband out of it... I keep telling him if he'll let it cool the banana flavor will come through even more.  My kids love it as well.  I had about 1/3 c extra banana so I cut back on the butter by 3 T.  I also sprinkled in a bit of cinnamon.  Will become a regular in my house.  In the future I think I will use just 1 c of choc chips and not put any on top.  Also I plan to try w/ butterscotch chips.

This is a very good and a very quick cake and was enjoyed by all. I used 1/2 cup marg. and 1/2 cup applesauce rather than the 1 cup of butter. Next time I'll only use 1 cup of applesauce rather than the butter. I also added a touch of cinnamon which was nice. I added the coconut to the dry ingredients and skipped the walnuts as we are a nut-free classroom.
My twin 7 year olds loved it and I will definitely be adding this cake to my "school baking" list.
Enjoy!!!!

My family loves this cake, it's never around for long.  We put all of the chocolate chips in the cake -- none on top, but I do top with some nuts.  Easy to make.
