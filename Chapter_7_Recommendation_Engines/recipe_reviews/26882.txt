I made these for a party and everybody loved them.  I didn't care for them as much due to the crunchiness of the peppers.  I'm not a huge bell pepper fan.  Perhaps next time I'll try sauteing them first.  A big hit with everyone else though.

Make these all the time!! I used 8oz cream cheese, 2 cups of cheese and all other ingrediants the same (omitting the olives). Very good. This may sound odd but this also makes for a great cheese ball for cracker spread. We all love this stuff! A nice spicy (not hot) treat!!

I made these for my Christmas party and everyone loved them!!  They all disappeared within minutes of putting them out.  The only problem I had was getting the rolls to stay together.  It didn't look quite as pretty as the picture but they were delicious!

Took these to a Coffee social and I believe they
went quickly.  Nice flavor but I could not cut them as pretty as the picture.  Overall I think the flavor was more important than appearance.

One word - AWESOME!  I was a little skeptical at first, but these came out great!  I didn't quite get 24 servings out of it, but I guess it depends on how big or small you cut the tortillas.   I got tons of compliments on these at my party!  I will make these again for sure!

I left off the bell peppers and for the cheese, I used the new Jalapeno shredded cheese from Kraft.  They were excellent!

These tasted pretty good, they got a little soggy after sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours.

Take this to any party and they will all be gone in minutes. I have made them several times now and I am not allowed to bring anything else. EVERYONE wants me to bring these. AWESOME!!
