Great tasting recipe. It would be helpful to know approximately how many won tons this recipe makes; I had a lot of filling left over not knowing how many wrappers to buy. But that was o.k.; I added it to my fried rice.:)

I replaced the pork with canned breast of chicken meat drained well. The won tons were a huge hit at the Super Bowl party. Well worth the effort - best I've ever tasted!

These are unbelievable. Who is this Mr. Kirk character anyway -- I want all of his recepies and I would like to enter him into a competition with the Iron Chef. They turned out just a bit crispy and delicious. Well worth the effort and the best I have ever had. Won Tons forever!

Very good receipe. There may have been too much vegetables. Try adding a little more pork to make the wontons more filling.

These were really yummy!! I added some chopped shrimp and a little extra soy sauce and they were extra good. This recipe makes a LOT of filling. I used a whole package of wrappers and still had filling left. I made up all that I could and froze the ones I wasn't using for dinner. I have used the frozen ones for a last minute appetizer and they came out great a month later!

These are amazing! My hubby & I made these together & had a lot of fun! They are time consuming but recipe makes a lot of wontons. We had some trouble with folding which thankfully doesn't affect the taste! With only the two of us eating we froze quite a few. They freeze & re-heat quite well. Can't imagine eating store bought ones anymore!

Didn't have good flavor and seemed to be too salty. Perhaps it was the choice of ingredients but in any case we will not be making them again.

These are wonderful! They are a lot of work but well worth it. I've made these a few times with great results each time. The first time I made these I was asked by friends to bring won tons to their stir fry meal. I had never made won tons before and found this recipe. I took the made up won tons and my fryer and cooked them at my friend's house. A few other people brought other appetizers but these were eaten up right away...and that the best compliment.

These are wonderful! After frying a few and tasting I thought the filling benefited from a sprinkling of dried ginger. They freeze and reheat nicely.

Loved them with minor changes...flavor needed a little more pop...doubled the soy sauce but eliminated the salt so they did not get too salty with the extra soy and added 1.5 tsp of fresh ginger.

These took FOREVER to make but watching my 4-yo wolf 'em down made it worth it. It could just be that it was my first time with wontons though: ) I substituted ground turkey for the pork and left out the bok choy and they were still fantastic. There was a lot left over but just stirred in some cooked white rice and a little more soy sauce and fried it up and that was good too.

These were the best won tons ever! Overall they were better than any restaurant! My husband and I both filled them so the prep didin't take as long. Now I will have to make these ALL THE TIME!! I thought the balance of veggies and meat was perfect thanks Mr. Kirk!

Still looking for the perfect won ton recipe; this is far from it. Not that good.
