My wife had never tried grits, so I made these for her.  I used half water, half milk and stirred in crumbled bacon bits at the end.  Not only were they fantastic that day, they were even better the next day when I formed the leftovers in to patties and browned them in some melted butter.  Not the healthiest thing in the world by any means, but  tasty!

I make grits all the time but found out that using velveeta cheese is way better than using cheddar cheese.  You can put anything in grits, even some salsa, veggies, salmon... almost anything. This is a real southern dish that will warm you up!

My two year old loves grits this way.  They are the best.  You can adjust the seasoning to taste and I recommend you try different types of cheese for variety.

I grew up watching my grandmother cook grits and her were always so creamy and perfectly prepared (be it with a little butter, S&P or cheese).  Her trick to add milk (she never measured it but my guess would be 1/4-1/2 cup), the milk makes them even creamier.  I've made what I call "Breakfast Succotash" by mixing cheese grits, a scrambled egg and bacon or sausage, mix thoroughly and serve with toast...a happy childhood memory for me!

My husband is from Charleston SC, where grits rule!  This recipe reminds me of an Edisto Island, SC, resturant's one!  Oh!  The savory memory is alive!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! My husband grew up with grits & eggs as a breakfast staple, and I'd never heard of them before we got married! This is a much easier and more reliable method than the instructions on the package, too.

This is really good.  However, instead of water, I used 2 cups 2% milk and 1 cup water.  And a splash of 1/2 and 1/2.  I've also made grits using reduced sodium chicken broth and milk and they are also very good.  Thanks for the recipe!  These grits were thicker than my other go-to recipe and I like that.  Not as soupy as before.

I found some GMO free grits at the store and was anxious to make some cheesy grits. This is the first recipe I tried and there is no need to look at any more! This is wonderful!! I had chili and grits for supper. Ahhhh...life is good!

Cheese grits are OK, but they are better without. I prefer quick grits that cook in 5 minutes. 4 cups water to 1 cup grits.  In either case, best recipe is on the box. For variety, the yellow corn grits/polenta is outstanding.

Made this recipe because I had made Shimp and Grits from a different recipe last night and we finished the Grits, but still had the shrimp and sauce left over.  I wasn't too fond of the other grit recipe because it was too rich (cooked with heavy cream - bleh!).  This was perfect, I cooked with half low-fat milk and half water.  Loved it thanks.

I bought grits at our local farmer's market and had no idea how to cook them.  This was exactly how I wanted them to turn out.

This gal can cook grits!! Have you tried adding some chopped up boiled shrimp? If we have any left over from our low country boils, I'll peel them and chop them up and add them to the grits about the last five min of cooking. My wife likes to add a half can of salmon(deboned of course) to her grits. That doesn't even sound good to me but,, she likes it, maybe some else out there will too.

I’ve only had grits one time before when visiting Charleston, SC.  BTW the gardens are as beautiful as described in garden magazines.  I know because I had absolutely no pride peaking into people’s gardens.   But I digress.  I always heard that grits were awful but I tried them just out of curiosity.  I really liked them and thought I’d try them at home.    I thought this dish was very good but not as good as I remembered having in Charleston.

Perhaps I should have focused on some coffee this morning. I didn't see the butter in this recipe, so I didn't add it. That said, I still think they turned out beautifully! I didn't add the cheese into the entire dish; I figured I could add the cheese at my discretion. I had a bowl with about 1tbsp of grated cheddar. Added some chives and served an over medium egg on top. They were delicious! Perfect consistency!

I can't believe after eating grits all my life I never tried cheese grits before. This dish is so good, and a step up from my butter, s & p. I could easily see adding some garlic and a sprinkle of cayenne. I used quick grits and still cooked them for about 12 minutes covered. Grits should be thick enough to eat with a fork and these were perfect. Thanks Jen, these were great!

Absolutely delicious. I use only milk and it comes out so creamy. I can either make it savory by adding a pat of butter and parmesean cheese, or sweet by pouring maple syrup on it.

Delicious! I did not like plain grits at all. These were so much better. It's amazing what a little cheese and butter can do.

While making breakfast this morning I decided to cook up some grits as well. I made it just like the recipe called for and then added crumbled bacon that they wife didn't want to finish. This recipe is so delicious that I've been eating grits all day long!

First time I've ever made grits at home. Turned out very good. Served it under a layer of Jambalaya. Great meal.

I made just regular grits, but if you like more lumpy grits, wait a little to stir them when you first add the grits to the water. Cream-ish grits you would stir right away.

I made this as a breakfast side. I didn't add salt and I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water. It was delicious!!!

Funny, this "recipe" is exactly what's printed on the bag of grits. :)

This was literally my first time making or eating grits.
We all thought they were very bland and flavorless.

Maybe it's an acquired taste?  We'll try again.

I made sweet breakfast grits for my husband that has a huge sweet tooth. I substituted coconut oil for the butter and I added a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon topped with blueberries. It turned out great.

I had never tried grits before - so I thought this would be a good recipe to start out with. It was pretty good. I would use this recipe regularly. I might add some sausages or something to be extra fancy next time, but this is a quick, easy, and delicious recipe for those busy mornings.

This was a hit! I was lowkey nervous making this because it was my first time making this for me and my boyfriend. I didn't measure the amount of cheese I added, I just kept adding until it had the desired cheesy effect I wanted which worked for me. Next time I might add something to it, maybe some bacon bits or sausage.
