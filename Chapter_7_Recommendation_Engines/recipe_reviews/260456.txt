Great taste... But next time would leave the chicken marinade in the oil/ lemon mixture for a few hours. Thanks for sharing

So delicious. I didn't have a whole chicken so I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I always have on hand so I shortened the cooking time accordingly but otherwise I followed the recipe and it came out great.  I will definitely make this again and next time I plan to add some carrots to the baking dish with the potatoes. Simple for a night when I don't feel like standing over the stove yet still delivers on great flavor!

I was looking for something different or non-traditional to do with chicken.  I can actually say that I am not used to the flavor, but the family really likes it.  Make sure your potatoes are fully covered by the sauce and drippings or they will be tough.  I used halos instead of an orange and it worked perfectly.
