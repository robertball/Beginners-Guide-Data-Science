What delicious mini cupcakes! Really fantastic! The cupcakes are some of the lightest and fluffiest I have ever had! Truly great with a strong chocolate-stout flavor and a perfectly soft texture. I think next time I make them I would use 1 cup sugar because they were just a touch sweet for my tastes. I also only used 3/4 cup softened butter in the cupcakes---1 1/4 cup just seemed like a lot to me (especially with only 1 1/4 cups flour in the recipe too). They turned out great, and I would definitely use 3/4 cup butter again in the future. The frosting was also pretty tasty! A bit sweet, but I added some salt to it, and that helped. I also didn't have quite enough to generously frost the 64 mini cupcakes I got out of this recipe, so I made another 1/4 batch and that covered them. My only minor ding to the recipe is that I wish that they were called "Chocolate Guinness Mini-Cupcakes" as I originally thought the recipe was for standard cupcakes. This really doesn't make much difference to how fantastic they are, but it would be a more helpful, in my opinion. I found they also needed 11-13 minutes to bake depending on how full you filled the mini muffin cups. Either way, great recipe! Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly but baked them in full sized cupcake tins in paper liners  and they were very good. It made almost 2 dozen. The cake portion didnâ€™t hold together as well as I had expected but they were still yummy. Way more frosting than needed to frost them tho.
