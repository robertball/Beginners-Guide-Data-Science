I had to throw it out! I should've trusted my instinct when I questioned the 2 tablespoons of baking powder. It left a bitter taste.  I think maybe the recipe should have read teaspooons.

Scaled recipe  in half and ued an 8 x8 glass dish.  I used frozen blueberries and mixed them with a small amount of flour before adding to batter so as not to break the blueberries. I also reduced to temp to 350 for 40 mins.  This smelled delicious coming out of the oven.  VERY, VERY GOOD! Not a dense coffee cake but very light.  Will definately be making this again soon!

Very good coffee cake.  I did reduce the baking powder to 2 teasp. and lightly flour the blueberries before adding to the cake mixture as other reviewers had suggested.  I put it in an 8" x 8" baking pan and used some of the mixture in a six cup muffin pan.  The muffins took 20 min. baking time and the cake took 50 min.  They smelled so good while baking, I had a hard time waiting for them to cool off enough before trying one.  Delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe Eunice.

This was an EXCELLENT coffee cake.  Made as is with no changes- except adding another handfull of berries to the top of the cake before sprinkling topping.  It just made it look prettier.  This won't disappoint. :)

DELICIOUS!!! I only made half a batch and made a few alterations. Smart Balance instead of butter, Splenda and sugar mix instead of just sugar, and brown sugar for the topping. Going to make a full batch next time, half just didn't last long enough!

This was EXCELLENT!  It was perfectly sweet, light, and moist.  I have it with a hot cup of tea in the morning as a nice treat.  I might try making it as muffins.  I will definitely make this again.

This was so good!  I had to make 2 changes.
1.  I had to bake it about 15 extra minutes
2.  The recipe didnt call for enough topping so I had to make about 50% more than it called for.  Very good thank you.

This was amazing!  I made this for a family gathering, and it was such a huge hit, I've made it 4 more times since then for others who have asked me to make it.  I did make a few small changes - I went with the suggestion of others and used only 2 tsps of baking powder.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and for the streusel topping I mixed regular sugar and light brown sugar.  I served it with a side of fresh whipped cream.

I'm not sure of what happened, but I cooked it according to directions and the middle remained uncooked. Regardless, the edges were delicious! My picky eater husband even ate 2 pieces.

made with 2 teaspoons baking powder this was outstanding! the batter seemed a bit goopy and thin in the pan, and took an hour to bake at 375, but the results were a tall, light and moist cake that was absolutely delish!

I thought this was a great recipe. I loved it!!! The only thing i would change is the cook temp. I read some reviews after i baked it, and i totally agree that it needs to be on 350 not 375. I followed the directions stated on the recipe and my came out a little dark on the top and not fully cooked in the middle. so i had to turn down the temp and let it cont to cook. But other than that simple change...it was yummy, and i will be making this one again.

this wasn't a bad recipe, but it was overpowered by blue berries and not a very crunchy streusel.  i ate it and tasted great but i probably wouldn't make it again

Very good recipe. I didn't have enough milk for 1 1/2 cups, but did have some buttermilk on hand. I used a little over 3/4 c. of buttermilk to make up for the shortage of milk, and it came out wonderfully. Very moist and tasty. Thank you for submittiing this recipe!

oh yum!  This was quick and easy, and the first thing I have ever baked that turned out edible!  I used less baking powder than the recipe calls for as per advice of others, but that was the only change I made.  The butter sugar topping melted and made more of an icing, but great tasting all the same.

5++ Delicious and not dense at all.  The center is nice and moist (the way I like it) and the edges are crispy (the way my husband likes).  I get so many compliments each time I make this.  My children love it.  I did read the reviews before I made it and reduced the baking powder to 2 TEASPOONS.  I used frozen blueberries and coated them with some flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  The cooking time for me was closer to an hour.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  So good with a cup of hot coffee or tea!  As I am writing this review I think I need to go downstairs and have another piece.

Coffee cake is good overall.  I went with the recommended 2 tsp instead of 2 tablespoons of baking powder, and it still tasted a little bitter to me.  I might try it with just 1 tsp next time.  Also, I had to bake mine for almost an hour until it was done.  Overall I don't think it was a total waste of my fresh blueberries and I'll probably make it again in the future.

I cut the recipe in half & baked it in an 8'x8' pan. It was light, fluffy, and delicious. I used fresh blueberries & cut the baking powder to teaspoons instead of tablespoons.

DELICIOUS! I took the advice of reviewers and did not add as much baking powder (1 tbsp not 2), and the cake was a hit! Even my vegan aunt couldn't resist the sugary crust! Some advice to those who use salted butter: don't ignore the tsp of salt just because of that. Though the cake was delicious, I could tell that it would have had a much fuller taste wit some salt added.

This seemed like a great recipe for a snowy morning and it was!  It is incredibly moist and delicious.  Just make sure you cut the Baking Powder from 2 TB to 2 tsp, I missed that until it was too late.  Still came out great though!  I did bake it for 50 mins.  I did not have a problem with the frozen blueberries going to the bottom but I added them right before it went in the oven so maybe that helped.  Highly recommend!

This cake is excellent.  I made this cake and took it to work and people were fighting over it.  I bake all the time and was told that it was the "best" baked good I have made.

What a fabulous way to use up my frozen blueberries from our garden! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly (using 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of the tablespoons typo). I skipped the streusel topping and when the cake cooled frosted it with a mixture of melted butter, vanilla extract, orange extract, powdered sugar, and milk. This is going to become a staple year round in my house. Thank you for the recipe!

Reallly, Really Good! Only used 2TSP baking powder. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It did take about 50-55 minutes to bake fully.  It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Everyone loved it!

I have made this several times now and my family just loves it. I took the advise of others and used 2 teaspoons, and rolled the frozen blueberries if a bit of flour. My daughter loves it so much she wants me to make it for her 7th birthday, insted of cake!Thanks so much for sharing it.

I've made this twice now, and I love it. It makes a generous size pan which is great when having company over. I used frozen blueberries and coated them in flour per the other recommendations. Worked great. We heated the cake up and served with ice cream. It was delicious!

This recipe is wonderful. I actually didn't use blueberries when I made this cake. I split the batter between two pie plates and made an apple coffee cake along with a chocolate chip coffee cake. This recipe has great vanilla flavor and I look forward to experimenting with it some more!

This is absolutely delicious.  Like others have mentioned use 2 tsp not tablespoons of baking powder.  I used frozen blueberries.  Baked at 350 and had to bake about 15 minutes longer.  It is moist and loaded with juicy blueberries.

I made this in a oval deep dish and had to increase the time to over an hour and reduce the heat a bit to 350. I checked the middle every 5 mins with a toothpick after the 45 mins mark.

This was delicious! The only thing I didn't expect was that the blueberries all sunk to the bottom while cooking, but it turned out great. A nice crispy golden crust, cake-like middle, and a nice squishy sugary bottom. Yum!

This is an AWESOME coffee cake recipe. I did change the amount of baking powder to 2 tsp. and added a bit of flour to the fresh blueberries before adding to the batter. Otherwise, this is the best and I will certainly use it alot.

Very good cake! I had to make a small change do to running out of milk. I used 1 cup sour cream and half a cup of vanilla soy milk. Came out SO tender and rich. My new favorite recipe for blueberries.

I had higher expectations for this from how it turned out.  It does taste very good, but I found it to be very crumbly.  I too had to cook it for about 50 minutes and it was darker in the middle than the edges. I did use the two Tlbs. of powder because I hadn't looked at all the reviews yet.  I guess I don't know enough about cooking to know the difference.

Not very good. I had 2 cups of blueberries and that was plenty. Seemed too sugary and got really wet/moist the day after. Took about an hour to cook. Probably won't make again.

This was delicious!  I followed other reviewers advice and added frozen berries just before baking so it didn't all turn purple, and I kept them in the freezer until I needed them.  Also used 2T of baking powder.  This didn't last a day in my house because we all had second and third helpings.

I made this for our annual Christmas breakfast.  There was not a piece left.  I had to email this recipe to several people.  The only change that I made was to add pecans to the topping and increased the cooking time.

One of hubby's favorite new recipes. Each time we have it he comments on how good it is.  I split the sugar with splenda (half sugar/half Splenda). I also didn't have enough flour on hand so used Bisquick mix in place of flour, baking powder, and salt. Delicious!!! Thanks, Eunice!

Amazing coffee cake I altered mine a bit with using Becel and then I added bananas that were super ripe. It is so moist and tasty.
