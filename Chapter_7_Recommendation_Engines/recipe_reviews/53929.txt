I started out with good intentions when I stopped to pick up crawfish tails to make this recipe.  However, after being delayed in traffic on an empty stomach, I decided to just eat one or two of the already cooked tails.  Well one or two led to just about all of them!  So, once I got home, I used shrimp that I had in the freezer.  This is a quick, easy, and delicious recipe.  I sauteed the onions and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the cooker before adding any of the other ingredients.  I didn't use butter. Also, rather than add the green onions at the beginning, I stirred them into the rice after it finished cooking.  A very good recipe.

I was skeptical about cooking all this in my rice cooker, and that everything would be cooked all the way through. Rest assured, it works great.   In addition to working as-is, it's a fine base recipe for variations depending on what you have on hand. The crawfish is good, but you could make it cheaper (save money on pre-peeled crawfish or time on peeling it) with shrimp, tilapia, catfish, etc., etc.

We substituted shrimp for the crawfish tails, but left everything else in the recipe the same. It was outstanding! Very easy recipe & the best part is that it only gets a cutting board and your rice cooker dirty - almost no clean-up! For the cajun seasoning, I used the creole seasoning mix here on AllRecipes. Both my husband & I agreed that it was some of the best food we've had in a while - and the easiest.

My first recipe in my rice cooker, it turned out great! My cooker is 3quart, had a little bit of liquid run over the side after it started cooking. Spicy flavor just right to warm you up on a cool rainy night.  Will definately make again. Thanks 8 )

I omitted the bell peppers and added celery.  I also do not have a rice cooker, so I just sauteed the onions and celery in the butter until soft, then added the everything else to the skillet, covered, and simmered until the liquid was absorbed.  After tasting, I decided to add some garlic powder and turmeric.  It was excellent, and I will make again.  Thanks!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I sautéed the onions and bell pepper in butter before adding to the rice. I also added half of a small jar of Velveeta Cheese Whiz to the mixture. Added a cheesy taste (which we LOVED). Served with garlic Texas toast. I expected leftovers for my lunch the following day...no such luck! My hubby went back for seconds!

I think it needed more Cajun seasoning and I had to add more broth because when it was done it was still a bit crunchy. Used shrimp. I will make it again with 50% more seasoning.

I sauteed my onion & green pepper first before adding to the mix. I also added my green onion right before serving. I also omitted the margarine. This was my first time cooking something other then rice in my rice cooker, turned out really good!

Love this recipe!!  I have never been able to pull off a jambalaya type recipe, which is what this recipe resembles.  It came out perfect!  I plan to try it using chicken and andouille sausage next time!!

This recipe, made exactly as written, was too bland.  It does have potential though.  Doctor it up with some garlic and extra creole seasoning, maybe some Tabasco or La Hot Sauce.  I love the one pot cooking aspect of the recipe.

I made this recipe with a couple of modifications based on what I had on hand. I substituted diced tomatoes with garlic and a chopped fresh jalapeño for the Ro-Tel tomatoes & green chilies. The rice was still undercooked after one cycle in the rice maker so I transferred it to a Corningware dish and placed it in the oven (preheated to 400 degrees) for about 30 more minutes. The flavor was nice but I did also add a dash of celery salt to the finished product.

Very good! Made it on the stove top since I don't have a rice cooker.  I sauteed the onions and peppers first then threw the rest in.  And topped with green onions when it was done cooking.  Quick and easy!  Will definitely make it again.

This is an awesome recipe. I just mixed up everything in the rice cooker itself. We like everything spicy spicy so I added a small can of original Rotels and the rest in diced tomatoes. Everyone will love this! You could make it with a pound of shrimp, too. I diced up my crawfish tails. Sa c'est bon!

I am making it again, tonight, for a church supper! They will be so impressed!
