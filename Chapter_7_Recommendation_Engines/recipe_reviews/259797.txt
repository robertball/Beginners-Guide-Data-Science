I used the instant pot to sauté the onion in the butter then switched to the slow cooker. We thought this was was yummy.  I added 1tsp of  rouge pimento and a 4 ounce can of mild diced Chili’s.   I put the crumbled bacon on the table to add as each person wished vs in the soup.    This way it added needed texture.  
I was worried the soup would be grainy but it was really smooth.  I’ll make it again. Easy, delicious and with a loaf of hot bread and a fresh green salad I made everyone happy!

While red potatoes would be ideal, russets was all I had so that is what I used. This turned out really good and was full of flavor. The one change I would make next time is to make extra bacon to set aside for garnish. I usually do this and just forgot. The additional texture and color would make this even better. Plus, you can never go wrong with more bacon. This is a good soup and one I would definitely make again!

This was absolutely wonderful - made 6 bowls / 2 meals and my family asked for it again the next week (highly unusual)!  I added chopped, marinated / jarred chili peppers to the toppings of bacon, cheese, and spring onions - yum.

When heating up the leftovers, I added 1/4 cup more chicken broth and 3 Tbsp more half and half to thin out the leftover soup as it thickened a bit in the refrigerator.  Plus, of course, I cooked and crumbled 3 rashers of bacon and shredded about an ounce (total) more cheddar cheese for topping the 3 remaining / reheated bowls.

WOW!!  Delicious!!!  I made 1  1/2 batch in my crock pot using russets and 48 oz chicken broth (didn't have anything smaller). I also cheated and used a pkg of the real bacon crumbles ~ it didn't take any longer for it to cook and came out AMAZING!  I will definitely will be making this again!!

Yum.  The only change I made was to saute the onions in the butter before adding it to the slow cooker.  It was filling and delicious on a cold winter's day.

I mashed the potatoes, onions, etc partially which gave the soup more texture.  Great recipe, everyone loved it.

Love this recipe! Made one shortcut change and used frozen hash browns, either shredded or diced. Cooked up the same and was terrific! The husband, who isn’t usually a fan of creamy soups, had seconds, ate leftovers and asked if this could become a “family favorite”!

I started out making this soup just as the recipe said, except I sauteed the onions and a minced garlic clove in the bacon grease before adding to the crockpot. When all was done, I felt the soup wasn't quite cheesy enough, so I ended up adding another 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and also another dollop of sour cream. At that point it was really delicious and my family enjoyed it. I'll definitely make it again!
