This is a really yummy recipe for hot chocolate.  Cinnamon is among my favorite spices and it gives this drink a really good flavor.

This is the real deal. Rich, frothy, great aroma. Just what I was looking for.
I served this with home made marshmallows. A real treat that will warm you up right down to your toes!

What a wonderful treat! I love mixing this up on a cold evening to sip while I'm reading, sewing, or browsing online. I used some cheap cocoa, I can only imagine how wonderful this would be with some top notch quality cocoa!

This was great!  I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened.  It came out perfect - the cinnamon flavor really added to it.  Just a bit of whip cream on the top - it was irresistible.  We didn't drink all of it so I refrigerated the rest in a plastic pitcher - it heated up great this morning in the microwave.  Love it and THANK YOU

I found that the chocolate never completly melted so the hot chocolate had little chocolate grains in it.  Perhaps, a different kind of chocolate would work.

This is an extremely rich recipe - which was too much even for my kids who love chocolate.  The adults did use some of it with our coffee for a mocha which was nice.
