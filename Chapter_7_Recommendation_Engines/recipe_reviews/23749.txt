These are great, I used regular (not natural) peanut butter which works better, and I used 2 cups of chocolate chips. Delicious!

A great quick and easy desert! I would recommend using a bit less peanut butter-maybe 1 1/2 cups, and a bit more chocolate. All of that peanut butter made it a bit too rich.

Very good! I took this to our New Year's Day dinner, and it was a huge hit. It tasted like a mixture of a reese's cup and a butterfinger (with the crunch from the rice cereal). 

I really didn't measure, but I used one stick of butter, creamy peanut butter and powdered sugar, mixed by hand, then added the rice cereal until it came together. Poured the chocolate on top and stuck it in the fridge. Too easy.

it's a little hard for kids to mix it but they have fun putting all the ingredients in
...3 cups of rice cereal is a little much, i would stick to 2 to 2 and a half cups
it got a little crumbly with 3.

Make this recipe, and people will ask for more.  It is one of the best desserts I have ever had.  I noticed that these bars are best served chilled.  They seem to get a bit messy when they get to room temperature.  However, it doesn't matter because THEY ARE SO GOOD!

Delicious! A few changes I made: I added chocolate chips in the batter instead of melted chocolate over top. I love it this way. Also, after I refrigerate if for a bit, I cut it into squares and put them in baggies to freeze them. That way it lasts a lot longer and I like the frozen treat. I don't know if others will though. I eat one of these a day; I'm addicted!

Love the addition of the crunchy cereal.  It really gives the bars a nice texture.  I had to use my hands to get the dough to come together, but then it was easily pressed into the pan, and easily cut into squares.  My kids and husband loved these!

I can't believe how easy this recipe was to make! I made it before work in about 35 minutes. It got rave reviews by all my co-workers. I didn't have quite enough sugar (about 1 2/3 cup), but I think it turned out just fine. Not too sweet, but with an intense peanut buttery crunch!

Delicious! A very quick, simple recipe. I scaled it to serve half as much, and it still turned out perfectly. I'd definitely make this again.

I made these as a kid for multiple county fairs - always got a blue ribbon.  We didn't use the chocolate.  And we used to shape them into logs, but I like the bar idea better.  The key to keeping them from being crumbly is to mix REALLY well.  It takes a while to mix in the powdered sugar.  Also it makes a big difference to use your hands instead of spoon. Now I get to share these with my kids!

My husband really loved these bars.  I thought they had a good taste, but were hard to cut and were very crumbly.  I may try this recipe with a little honey mixed in next time to keep the bars together.

I made 160 bars for our Boy's and Girl's Club in Memphis.  They were crazy over these...adults too!  I will make them again, but reduce the peanut butter a bit & add more cereal because they did get pretty gooey when they became room temperature.  Great recipe!

I like this recipe because it was very easy and didn't require a lot of ingredients.  I thought it was good but gave it four stars because I'm not so sure about the semi-sweet chocolate on top.  It was a little too sweet for me.

I had Cocoa Pebbles and margarine on hand so I substituted them in addition to chunky peanut butter. I added vanilla because the mixture seemed too dry but the final product was still crumbly, likely due to the margarine and difference in cereal changing the texture...still delicious as it is hard to make peanut butter and chocolate taste bad together!

I am limited on what I can bake with being on a gluten free diet so I decided to try this one out.  Easy ingredients but super hard to stir.  I decided to just use my hands to stir the cereal into the peanut butter mixture which works great.  A bit on the sweet side but delicious!

This recipe is similar to one we used all the time growing up.  We use 1 c. peanut butter, 1 c. granulated sugar and 1 c. light karo instead.  Also, we don't add the peanut butter until after the mixture has come to a boil and been removed from the heat.  And we use 6-8 cups of rice krispies.  The key to keeping them from crumbling is "proper compaction" as my father would say.  Then we melt the milk chocolate chips directly on top of the bars using a hair blow dryer.  I know that's really odd, but that's how it's done at my house.  Put in the freezer for 20 minutes to properly set.

My family really liked this recipe & will be making it again soon. I used a mixer to mix the first 3 ingredients. Added the rice cereal then divided that between 2 8X8 pans. I put 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate in one pan & 1 cup of milk chocolate in the other pan. I warmed the knife under hot water before cutting which helped keep the chocolate from breaking. I definitely think you should double the chocolate as I did. As far as which kind, I think that is personal preference. My family was 2 for semi-sweet & 2 for milk. I hope this helps! Thanks for the recipe!

The chocolate hardens and when trying to cut the bars, it cracks and is messy. Then the bars were still squishy hours after being refrigerated. Needless to say, I was disappointed in the recipe, it tastes okay but is really rich in peanut butter and seriously lacks presentation.

Very good treats. Took them to work and they were gone in a flash. Simple to make, and i found that using my hands to mix was easier than a spoon.

The taste was very good, not too strong of any one flavor.  My only problem was that they were so crumbly when cut.  I lost almost half of each bar in crumbs.  I don't know if I did something wrong but I don't think I will make them again for that reason.

They were rather soft when out of the refrigerator.  I added more rice crispies the second time and it was better, but I don't see how you could take them out as an easy snack; still a little messy.  Yummy flavor.  Husband loved them.

I am absolutely OBSESSED with these! I use all the ingredients, but toss the choc. chips into the mix at the end instead. Just made them again, but as I doubled the recipe I left out 1 stick of the butter.  Have them in the freezer, hope this batch works lol.

I made modifictions, for a nearly sugarless recipe!

I used 100% peanut butter, crunchy. I

 replaced the confectioners sugar with 2 cups Splenda & 1 cup Rice Dream drink. You may use soy milk or whatever. This  makes a gooy chewy bar. 

Obviously, there is some sweet here! But it is super reduced. 

I also used Rice Dream drink in the melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, until it was smooth. I daringly used 2 cups io chips; but, you can also use unsweetened, or cocoa/cacoa. Cocoa/cacoa needs thickening; I think. So, to save time, I used chips. 

I also added some sea salt - since there was none in the peanut butter.  It is nut necessary.

This worked out to be a killer treat! Super delicious! Much much healthier! 

You can also cut as much butter as necessary. Substitute butter with pumpkin or fruit puree. 

Next time, I am going to use pumpkin, which does NOT taste like you brain thinks it does! LOL If you do that, be certain that your liquids balance, asand butte contains a bit of water.

I forgot to add the crispy cereal, and I didn't have the chocolate chips so I used Dove Dark Chocolate. This recipe is good, but I felt like I didn't have enough of the peanut butter mixture or the chocolate. The  taste was delicious, but I will definately have to find the measurements that work. I was also expecting the peanut butter mix to be thicker.

Oh my gosh, my family and friends went crazy over this bar cookie/dessert.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to up the crispy rice cereal to 4 cups.  I really needed them up set up and cut nicely.  The four cups worked perfectly for me and that is how I will make them again.  I wanted the bars thinner than what a 13x9 pan would make, so I spread the mixture on a cookie sheet.  The trick to cutting the bars without the chocolate breaking is to let it partially set up, cut, but don't remove from the pan, until the chocolate has set.  I let them rest 15-20 minutes before cutting.  My son and DIL were visiting from TN.  I sent a container home that I had froze for them.  About a week later, I received a phone call asking what 'freakin' amazing' dessert I had sent home with them.  I guess it was a winner with them, too.  This will definitely be made again in our house.

Kind of disappointing actually.  I'd recommend more Rice Krispies.  The Pb layer is mostly peanut butter, so it feels overly rich.

I was bored and was looking for an easy recipe to whip up kinda quick and this was the perfect thing! It was not only easy but it was also DELICIOUS! The creamy peanut butter pairs perfectly with the crispy rice cereal and you indulge in every bite! Will definitely be making this again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a touch less sugar and a touch more chocolate. They were really yummy, and fine right out of the fridge....but they got really mushy and messy after sitting out a while. Maybe I should have added more rice krispies. But the were tasty and quick, so I'll likely make them again. For me, its hard to go wrong with anything chocolate and peanut butter!

Made these for a party; got rave reviews.  Used 1 c homemade crunchy PB and 1c skippy low fat.  1c of chocolate chips is a bit on the low side, would probably do 1.25c next time.

Note that these are more "crunchy peanut butter bars" than "peanut butter flavored Rice Crispie" bars.  When looking for the recipe I was originally imagining the latter, but happy the way these came out.

These were good.  I did alter the recipe based on the other reviews and I received good feedback.  And I added chocolate on top.  The next day, they were soggy, though.  Oh well.  Still good.

These were absolutely delicious. I refrigerated mine for about 3 hours before eating them. The only complaint I have is that the peanut butter mixture really didn't solidify like I thought it would, it was more mushy. The chocolate on top was very hard and I found it difficult to cut through it. The taste of everything was awesome though.

To make this a five star recipe I would use Hersh milk cholate rather than the semisweet chips, and mix 1/4 cup honey in the peanut butter.

This one got rave reviews from everyone!  I used about 2-1/2 cups cereal per other reviews, but it would work fine with 3.  The key is to make sure they are very well chilled and solid when you cut them.  Since I used natural peanut butter, I added an extra 1/4 cup or so of sugar, and it came out perfectly.  I also increased the amount of chocolate chips for the top per other reviews.

These turned out to be very tasty. I used a healthy 2 1/2 cups of rice krispies. I think it may be better with milk chocolate, but got no complaints as is!
