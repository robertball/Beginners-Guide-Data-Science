This recipe is awesome!!!! Not only does it look exquisite, but it tastes wonderful!!! It is also quite easy to make. I buy a premade Oreao crust though. Everytime I make it people ask for the recipe. This one is definately a crowd pleaser!!!

Yummy!  Very chocolatey! I didn't have heavy cream so I used "dream whip" instead and it turned out really nice.  Less calories too!  : )  I also substituted pecans for the walnuts.  Great for a hot summer day.  I will make this again.

A bit disappointing given all the great ingredients.  The various textures (chocolate chips, nuts, marshmallows) distracted from the creaminess you expect from a cheesecake.  I thought this would be good for kids and adults alike.  Several of the kids didn't finish and, as an adult, it wasn't worth the calories.

I chopped up the marshmallows before folding into the cream cheese mixture and added 1/4 cup of marshmallow cream instead of gelatin its what I had on hand, came out perfect. I finely chopped the walnuts and used them as a garnish as I served each slice as well as extra marshmallows.
