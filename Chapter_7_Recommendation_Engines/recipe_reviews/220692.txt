Very good, will be making again for my husband and I! I couldn't find the herb and garlic cooking creme so I simply used the garlic version I found. I added some sea salt before serving without realizing how salty it was naturally so I won't be doing it again, but that was my mistake and overall I highly enjoyed it!

Great recipe for the sauce. Didnâ€™t have the garlic herb cream cheese so I added herbs to regular cream cheese. It was still very tasty and creamy. Cooked my salmon from frozen (last minute dinner with what we had) but no matter it was very good.

I couldn't find the cream cheese spread indicated in the recipe, so I substituted with Alouette's garlic & herb cheese spread.  What a mistake!  The sauce did not complement the salmon.  I will try the recipe again once I track down the recommended cheese spread.
