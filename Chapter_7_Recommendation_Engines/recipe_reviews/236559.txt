These cookies are pretty tasty. If you make them larger than "walnut-sized", increase baking time by at least 5 minutes. Adding chocolate chips makes them even better!

I love avocados. I had a lone one chilling in my house and wanted to use it in a creative way. I spotted this recipe a while back and felt that today was the best day to try it. However, I really do not like these cookies. 

I followed the recipe, so that wasn't the issue. I think it'a my tastebuds. I took one bite into the cookie and thought they tasted very weird. Avocado naturally has a subtle yet unique taste. It's fruity yet buttery, savory yet sweet. In this recipe, a new side of avocado is displayed: one that isn't overshadowed by eggs, bacon or toast; one that isn't mixed together with tomato, lemon, red onions and more to make guacamole. I'm used to avocado being the palate, not the star. In these cookies, they are the star, and paired with the butter, they seemed overwhelming to me. Like really strange butter cookies. 

I really wanted to love these cookies - the color is beautiful, making them was fun, and they smell great. But I am not a fan. I am a fan of the creativity behind this recipe, though!

What a surprise find!  I was looking for a different cookie and ran across this unique ingredient cookie.  I happened to have one avocado that I needed to use it or lose it.  I made it as written, but did dip the tops in turbinado sugar before baking.  Using my small (3-bites for me, 2-bites for DH) cookie scoop, I got 74 cookies from a single batch.  That is enough to share with several people.  The cookies took 9 minutes in my electric oven and baked up crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  The flavor is very gentle with this cookie, kind of reminds me of a sugar cookie.  Definitely not an avocado, but kind of like a creamy texture of an avocado.  I know that sounds really weird, but they are very good and you should try them for yourself to really understand what I'm trying to explain.

I used a whole avocado and added chocolate chips. These were fluffy and delicious and mine ended up being green (perfect since I made them at Christmas time). The dough smelled almost like pizza dough but the cookies taste like regular, delicious, fluffy cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe! Super easy to make - I love that the bottom of the cookie turns out slightly harder and the middle is soft! I added semi-sweet chocolate chips. Everyone I've made them for loves them.

Yummy!  I wasn't sure I was going to have any dough left to bake cookies as I couldn't stop eating the dough!!!  (Yes, I know you're not suppose to)  I love the taste and I don't think anyone would ever guess that these wonderful cookies are made from avocados.  I would have given it five stars, but they are hard.  I put half of them in an airtight container and other half in ziplock bag.  I highly suggest the airtight container.   I just dipped mine in my  coffee and thoroughly enjoyed them.

I followed the directions exactly  and they were good. I thought they needed a little something so I added chocolate chips to the next batch and they were delicious. I think I will add walnuts next time just to try something different.

Added ingredients ,1/2 cup chopped walnuts, chocolate bar chopped, 1 tsp all spice. Used mixer with whisk attachment when eggs are incorporated for 3-5 minutes. Makes the cookies lighter and lift. Roll walnut size balls onto parchment lined cookie sheets, don’t press them to hard keep the air in them.   Mash down cookie with frosting spreader or butter knife crisscrossed to about 1/4 inch thick. Bake 12-15 minutes rotate pans. Slide off baked cookies to cooling racks, makes 40 cookies

Loved this recipe!  I came across it when I was looking for a way to use up some avocados that were on the verge of going bad.
They are easy to make and take little time.  My family devoured them.

I had a couple avocados that were getting close to being to ripe to use and saw this recipe. I decided to give it a try and glad I did. I don't normally like it when people say I did this recipe but made these changes, but in this case I will mention my changes. I thought maybe instead of butter I would try coconut oil. I used the same amount as the recipe called for butter and chilled it a bit first. The only other change I made was I decided to add lemon juice to the mix. I love these cookies and am going to try it again as soon as the snow clears so I can get more avocados :-) . Next time I am going to make one batch just as I did this time and one batch exactly as the original calls for. Can't wait.

I thought these were very tasty. The other reviews on here honestly made me laugh with their details. I did have to cook them a little longer than the time stated in the recipe and I also only used 3/4 cup of butter because I hate how so many recipes call for a ton of butter and it's not needed. Cookies were very soft and didn't have much of an avocado taste, but that's okay, they were like soft sugar cookies

My family found these to be soft and fluffy.  I added white chocolate chips and pistachios.  Quite delicious!  I put dough in  fridge as suggested for 30 minutes, and I made larger cookies, baking them 12-14 minutes.

Not sure what I did wrong but the cookies all murged together to make a flat gooey mess. the outside is cooked but the inside is still raw. Very disappointed as I was expected to try a new recipe to get my family excited for "healthy" food.

They are pretty good, but I give it just three stars because by the flavor, you cannot tell it’s avocado. But everyone liked them, even people who “doesn’t like” vegetables.

These taste pretty good and an interesting way to use up avocados.  I used two avocados to get 3/4 cup mashed without any waste.  I made my cookies bigger and adjusted the time accordingly.

I'd give this ten stars if I could.   Awesome.  Made 1/2 batch using 6 T. mashed avocado which was one large.   Only change I made was I rolled them in sugar before baking.  My walnut sized ones took 10-11 minutes...and I got almost 3 dozen.  you do need to chill the dough before scooping and in between batches - IMO that is crucial.

in so-cal we're all about making things healthier.. avocado=healthy, hence why i wanted to make this.. unfortunately i wanted to make this even healthier than it already was and maybe that's why this didn't turn out the way i had hoped for (giving it the benefit of the doubt).. i cut this down to 9 servings.. for the 1/2 egg i used an egg white.. subbed 1/3 of the flour with soy flour.. i subbed 2 tbsp of margarine and 1 tbsp of olive oil for the 1/4 cup of butter.. i used half white sugar and half brown sugar.. and kosher salt for the sea salt.. i wanted to indulge a bit so i crushed a bag of peanut m&m's and mixed them in and added a bit of almond extract.. the end product came out more like a scone.. bf and i both agreed this needed much more sugar.. which was very different for us as we don't like overly sweet foods.. i think amberlou is spot on with the fact that this is a subtle flavored cookie and not overly sweet.. i'm puzzled at the fact that  i seem to be the only one who had a bad review of this.. but i need to keep in mind "healthy cookie"

I substituted unprocessed coconut sugar for the white sugar (1 1/4 c) and whole kamut flour for the white flour. 

Even with the whole-grain flour, they are light and fluffy with a little crunchiness around the edges, as described by others who followed the original recipe. Mine are a little on the dry side and not very sweet--almost more like little scones than cookies. 

Best right out of the oven. After a few hours, they got hard. Still good with some coconut milk.
