A truly delightful pork pate!  I did make one addition to the written recipe however. I decided it needed just a small 'kick' to it. Hence, I added 4 tbls of "finely" crushed corriander seeds. (A clean coffee grinder works a treat for this opration. A mortar and pestle works just as well, but is a time-consumming opera-tion and can cause cramping of your hands.).  I be-lieve that the coffe grinder is the easiest and fastest mode to use.  I also let them sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours and gave them one final stir before per-manent storage.  This allows he flavours to meld.  A real gem to present to your guests with your drink of choice whilst the dinner is merrily cooking away in the kitchen. +David

i have been making creton this way for over 40 years ….the only thing missing is 1/8 cup of duck fat…it marries well with the lean ground pork…and a pinch of cinnamon  i like mine a little on the salty side…i make the same batch every sunday and in most cases its all gone by tuesday…
 the best creton should spread like peanut butter and leave the knife moist.

You pretty much need to season this to taste including the allspice.  Everywhere I look they are saying it's prounounced Gor-ton , this is incorrect.. trust me it is pronounced Ca-tons.
this is an excellent recipe.
