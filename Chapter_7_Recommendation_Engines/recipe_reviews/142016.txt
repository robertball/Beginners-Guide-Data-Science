WOW.  I think I died and went to heaven.  After a dry run last week, I made this cake again with a couple of small changes, which I think improved it, even though it is an AWESOME cake just as it is.  First, I added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the batter, and the biggest and the best change was that I made a cream cheese frosting, adding the coconut extract.  I always slightly underbake my cakes and I suggest you do the same...

don't know what i did wrong, but this cake did not impress me. i bake for a living and was not happy with recipe. followed recipe did not experience the coconut aroma mentioned and cake was not real moist as promised. icing called for 7 cups of sugar, i used 5 and that was plenty..was still very sweet. will not be making this again.

A friend and I made this for a Hawaiian party and it was fantastic. You can cut the icing recipe in half, though, if you don't like thick frosting.

I am a coconut-aholic, but this was just too sweet for me.  The cake part was moist and good, but would be better with an icing that's toned down a bit.  Very pretty, but just way too sweet.

I am a coconut fanatic and try a new coconut recipe every week.  This is by far the best coconut cake I have ever made or tasted.  It got rave reviews and recipe request with our small group Bible study last night.  The frosting recipe definately make too much.  So I used my leftovers on a second cake a week later.  I bulked it up with a little more coco milk and powdered sugar.  Stored it in the fridge while cake cooled.  I whipped it up with the beaters again when I went to frost my cake.  Everything seemed fine, but as I was frosting, it started melting and sort of turned into a big mess.  Not sure what happened there, but still delicious and no complaints!  I will make this recipe over and over!  Oh, I couldn't find "instant" coconut cream pudding in our store, so I used the "cook and serve" variety in the recipe the same way.

Okay..I loved everything about this cake! The icing on the other hand..was not so crazy about! It didn't seem to pair well with the cake and I wish I hadn't added it to the cake after all was said and done. It was too sweet and I wasn't crazy about the texture or taste. I would DEFINITELY make the cake again but I will look for another icing recipe to use in place of the one listed.

I made this cake on Sunday morning and it truly does smell divine! The cake is easy to whip up although I did have to use regular coconut pudding mix as I could not find any of the instant kind.

The cakes were VERY moist, so much so that I cracked one taking it out of the pan. I will know better next time.

One other thing that I did was make less frosting. I used about 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup coconut milk, 1/2 tsp coconut extract and 2 cups icing sugar and there was just enough frosting to cover the cake.
Everyone who tries this cake, loves it! Not to mention, it is very light tasting.

I made this cake for work.  It is a wonderful cake with coconut flavor bursting throughout.  All of my co-workers raved about it.  I am going to make one for home now, but I am going to soak the left over coconut milk into the bread like my mom always did on her coconut cakes.

Followed this recipe almost exact, except I couldn't find a cake mix without pudding already in.  I put a box of pudding mix in anyways, and this cake turned out so moist!  I didn't have any coconut extract, but wasn't looking for a super strong coconut cake.  I also added a little sweetened flake coconut to the batter.  I checked my box mix baking time, and it was only about 25 minutes, so I undercooked by a few minutes.  I could have taken it out even earlier, but it was fine.  I used the party cake topping recipe from this site, but substituted coconut cream pudding mix and coconut milk.  YUMMY!  This cake was inhaled by my coworkers!

My review is for the CAKE PART ONLY: The cake part is 5 stars. I used another frosting. I don't see how anyone got a bad result out of the cake part of this recipe. I WILL say, though, that I did add liquid to the cake batter. In my case I added buttermilk, but I would've used coconut milk otherwise (I had already measured it out and frozen the remainder of the can). I didn't like the texture the cake batter was getting as the pudding "developed". It was probably fine, but it was giving me a distinct pound-cake impression, so I loosened the batter with buttermilk, around 1/4 cup or so, just a splash at a time. There's not much else to say -- it smelled great, it tasted great, it was moist, and tender like all box cake mixes. Thank you for the tasty coconut layer cake recipe!

I made the cake part as directed by the recipe.  The icing I had to kind of wing it since I was trying to make it with Splenda.  The Splenda did not disolve in the butter and was very grainy so I had to add 8 oz of cream cheese to smooth it out.  This cut down on the sweetness of the icing considerably.  Next time I will probably just use a basic cream cheese icing and add the coconut extract and coconut milk.  Anyway, the final result was probably one of the best cakes I have ever made!

Followed the recipe as written. Cake is AWESOME! The icing however, although good, is so sweat it is almost painful! Will make the cake again but will use a different icing!

I'm rating for the cake part only as well - I wasn't able to follow directions exactly as I was rushing to use up some coconut milk, but the end result was so good, I simply had to thank you for recipe.  I didn't have coconut pudding, so used French Vanilla, nor did I have the coconut extract (omitted).  I added 1/2 c of coconut as others mentioned - deliciously moist!  Baked in bundt pan apx 50" and will probably serve tonight with fresh berries, bananas, and whipped cream and garnish with toasted coconut.  Note to others, I panicked after seeing calorie count and ran a quick check on a program I have - the frosting itself (using 10 person guide which I think is quite high - 16 more like it) has 532 calories pp.  Omitting it would drop your calorie count for a huge slice to around 425 +/-.  Cut by a third and you're down to around 300

This cake was not moist at all, and the cake part really didn't have much coconut flavor, the cake mix overpowered it.  Everyone that ate the cake said it was good, but thought I only put coconut on the outside of the cake.

I made this cake in a bundt pan, so had to cook about 50 minutes. Also used a bit more toasted coconut to completely cover the cake. Sent to work with  my husband, so I never got to try it - but I heard it was a big hit!

This is excellent!  You would never guess it came from a cake mix--I used a French Vanilla cake mix. Between the layers I used the blueberry sauce and coconut cream cheese frosting--both from this site.  I can see it with strawberry and many other possibilities!  Thanks so much for sharing this outstanding recipe!

I can't believe the rave reviews I get for this cake. You have to try it to believe it. I add a little less sugar to the frosting (about 6 cups) but that is all the change I made.

I found this recipe the week of mother's day....my mom's favorite is coconut cake.  Recipe is super easy. It was gone in one sitting and everyone LOVED it!  Since then I've had to make it 4 times!  For memorial day, I colored coconut red and blue and added in plain coconut.  Everyone is exited about this cake!

I've been using this recipe for 3 years now and it is AMAZING.  I don't change anything, other than omitting the pecans.    My husband loves coconut, so I made this for his birthday.  This cake is moist and SO full of flavor!  My kids loved it so much that now they ask for this cake as well.  It just doesn't get any better than this!

Fabulous coconut kitchen when cooking! I used a hand mixer for 5 minutes and after baking 30 minutes at 350 the cake was above the sides on both pans. After cooling 15 minutes they both fell. As you see from my photo they still looked good frosted. This is a gift so I'll have to wait for the birthday girl to tell me if it was cooked through. I halved the frosting as suggested by another reviewer and added a few extra teaspoons of additional coconut milk. Perfect amount of frosting. The frosting is so pure white that I skipped the toasted coconut which would dress it down. Wish I knew how to make roses!!

If I could give this cake 10 stars, I would! I have never heard my relatives rave on and on about any dessert I've made as much as they did about this cake. I actually set out to make it following the recipe exactly, but discovered last-minute the store did not have any coconut instant pudding...and I discovered I was short on a few ingredients. Oy! So I substituted French Vanilla instant pudding and it worked great. Then, instead of SEVEN cups of powdered sugar, I found I only had FOUR. (panic time!) but the frosting turned out SO lovely - I can't imagine it with seven cups of sugar! This cake was to die for and is a new annual tradition in my family!

This only  needs to be refrigerated if you use fresh coconut.  My cake fell, but it did taste good.  I used half the frosting.  It is very sweet.  Also, I used Almond flavoring because I could not find coconut flavoring in my area.  It gave it a nice taste.

This was not a BAD cake..just was not very "Coconutty". As another reviewer, I did NOT achieve any coconut aroma...it scaresly tasted like coconut. Cake was moist and tasty..but lacked any real coconut flavor. Also, I should have read all the reviews (or at least paid heed to the ones I did read) that the frosting was horribly sweet. I frosted between the layers with a chocolate frosting to break up the icky sweetness. I will not be making this cake again. Less than impressed.

Okay, so I made the cake and was trimming it in preparation to frost it, and I was nibbling the trimmings the whole while.  I thought the flavor, texture, and moistness of the cake was *fantastic.*  Then I frosted it and decorated it.  Frankly, the cake tastes *way* better than the frosting.  It has a very pleasing, mild coconut flavor that other cakes have failed to deliver.  However, the icing is achingly sweet (I did leave out the coconut) and, I think, doesn't pair well with the cake (just my opinion).  That being said, the kids loved it and it's completely gone two days later.  Five star cake, three star frosting.

My mother in law wanted me to make her a coconut cake with sugar free Pillsbury yellow cake mix.  Was so happy to find this recipe.  It was a hit. I did make a few changes. I used my own recipe for coconut buttercream. I torted my cake and filled it with the buttercream and unsweetened coconut. Did not use any pecans. It was so delish and the coconut flavor was on point. Thanks!=)

Made this for the first time today for a Mother's Day barbecue.  Lots of coconut fans there.  Everyone loved it, but I expected it to be much more moist.  I did add a 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the cake batter as one reviewer suggested.  I made half the frosting which was plenty sweet but did not cover the entire cake as I'd hoped.  Next time I'll underbake it just a few minutes and make the full amount of frosting.  This was an easy recipe that yielded no leftovers.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe for the cake but made the frosting from the Coconut-Cream Cheese Frosting recipe on this site to go with it. I couldn't find an 18.25oz box of cake mix so I bought two 15.25oz  boxes and added a little extra cake mix from the second box. The cake was really moist and the cream cheese frosting was delicious. I'll definitely make this cake again.

Baked for Easter, my sister says it tasted like really good wedding cake. Followed cake directions completely, frosted with coconut flavored 7 minute frosting & topped with coconut.

This was really delicious. With all the coconut ingredients, I thought the flavor would be overwhelmingly coconuty but it wasn't at all. The whole family loved it. On a side note this cake was impossible to frost without getting cake particles all through it but the toasted coconut disguised  it perfectly.

This is a very good recipe. The only thing I did different is I made a small batch cream cheese frosting added coconut extract instead of vanilla and used coconut milk. I used this in between the layers. This cake is super moist. I will definitely make it again!

I almost didn't submit this review because of some changes I made to the submitted recipe. I made the cake and used Publix buttercream frosting.

I made this for my father n law who is nuts for coconut. Everyone raved about the cake, and no doubt I'll make it again before he leaves. I was very surprised at how light this cake is, with the pudding I expected a very dense cake. 

I don't know if others have encountered this issue, but I could not locate any 18.25 ounce box mixes and ended up using what seems to be the new standard, a 15.25 instead. Although I like the flavor of butter, I swapped it for vegetable oil, which I think makes a moister cake. Also, I used regular coconut pudding as instant wasn't available. As another reviewer noted, when the pudding blooms, the batter becomes very thick. I added 2-3 tablespoons of coconut milk to thin it out some. Finally, for reasons too, too long for this review I used two 9x9 pans to make my layer cake. Those worked fine and cut down the cooking time. I checked after 20 minutes or so and the cakes were done. 

I assembled by slathering icing on the bottom layer, adding toasted coconut and repeated for the top. The only problem was the layers tended to slide apart.

The icing is terrible! Way too sugary
