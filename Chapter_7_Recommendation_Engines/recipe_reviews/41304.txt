I made this for a party I had last week. My only regret is that I did not double the recipe. The dip was gone almost immediately!

This is easy, but lacked interest.  I'm not even sure what would have perked it up.  Everyone tried one celery stick of it and then it remained untouched.

Everyone loves this dip!  I use it a lot to bring to parties and always double it.  It all goes!  The best part is it is low in calories and fat!

was a little disappointed.  I did not want to get picante sauce for just 1 Tbsp so I used several drops of hot sauce but it still was just a little tasteless.

Tasteless...I guess I expected more. No one ate it! Sorry
