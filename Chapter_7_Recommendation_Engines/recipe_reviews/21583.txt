Since the majority of people were baking this 1-1/2 hours, I did the same.  
I also added for flavor 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of 
ground ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinamon to make it taste so 
much better.  These ingredients were used in other recipes so I just added 
it to this one.

The recipe is wonderful, but I had to cook it at 350 degrees for about 1 2/2 hours to get it soft-set and custard-like.  Baked according to directions it was really really soupy.

Excellent recipe. You can change the 2 cups sugar to 1/2 or 1 and so its not so soupy, cook in a bigger baking dish.  Other then that its very very good.Thanx

My grandma used to make rice pudding all the time, and this recipe tastes just like hers did.  It was great, although the baking time takes longer than 30 minutes.  About an hour and 1/2 was how long I cooked it.  I used this recipe with left over rice, and it was perfect.  The kids had never had rice pudding before.  They loved it.

Wonderful recipe.  I omitted the raisins.  I baked it for about an hour and a half to get it to have the right texture.

Rice Pudding is usually easy to make.  We left out the raisins, but it was just too sweet.

I loved this recipe but lowered the caloric content.  I used all Splenda instead of sugar and 1% milk instead of whole milk.  I added the cinnamon as recommended.  That was a great touch.  I too had to bake it for 1 1/2 hours to get the desired consistancy.  Delicious and virtually guilt free~

Didn't taste too bad, but the texture didn't work for me (too eggy).  I will keep looking.

This recipe was a tad too much. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, (It still may take a little less sugar ¾ or ½ cup may suffice.) the milk to 2 cups and the egg amount to 3. I kept all of the other ingredients the same. It cut the cooking time down also. I cooked in the oven for a total of 35 minutes stirring every 10 min to keep the rice from burning and sticking to the bottom. I also added 2 cinnamon sticks while cooking. This way so far it turned out perfect! I then added cinnamon to top and refrigerated it.

This recipe is flawed.  First, although there is no mention of water in the ingredients list, the first step of the directions instructs you to "bring water to a boil".  What water?  I just used the amount of water recommended for cooking the rice, but then when it turned out so soupy I began to wonder if I had used too much.

Unfortunately, I did not read through all of the reviews before I made it and therefore did not know I needed to bake it for 1-1/2 hours.  I let it go for 1 hour before the bottom started burning.  The end result is a (sickly sweet) soupy mixture with clumps of gooey, partially burned rice.

Oh yeah, and it could use some cinnamon.

I'll try another recipe next time.

The flavor was great, but the mixture ended up dry and the rice was mushy.  I will not be making this again.

This recipe was simple to make, but definetly needed to be cooked for at least 1 hour. Next time I make it I will cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Original recipe was way to sweet. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.

As written, this recipe is deficient. It was soupy and the bottom was overcooked. A larger shallower dish or longer baking time at a lower temperature might have fixed it. I will try again

Great! I reduced the milk and omtted the flour and used Splenda (1 cup). Still great but faster and lower calorie

I always try to make healthier lower calorie versions.  I used splenda instead of sugar and brown rice.  I also used skim milk.  As well I replaced part of the rice with chia seeds to add some protein.  I didn't tell my husband and he said it was just like his mom used to make lol!

The rice pudding was good on its own but I'm knocking it down to four stars because the instructions for cooking it are completely wrong!
 I had to turn my oven up to about 375° and I baked it for about an hour .

I never made rice pudding before, but I will def. make it again! I added a little nutmeg. Also, because the reviews said it's too milky, I cut the milk to 3 cups  and cut the suger to 1 1/2.  Also, he rice was leftover from dinner at an Indian restaurant  so it had a great taste!

Loved it!  Like others, I stirred it once during baking, turned the oven up to 350, and cooked it for over an hour.
