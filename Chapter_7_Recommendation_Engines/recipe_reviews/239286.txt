Simple, sweet and delicious cake.  I made this in a gluten free version (subbing 1/3 cup of all purpose GF flour and 1 Tbsp sweet rice flour for the wheat flour).  Didn't have any amaretto so I used 2 Tbsp of Vin Santo and a few drops of bitter almond extract. It has a delicate texture and sweet taste.  I baked it in a 9-inch porcelain tart dish and it was baked throughout in 23 minutes.  The lack of baking powder doesn't make it heavy by any means.  This recipe renders a light and delicate cake perfect for a mid-afternoon snack with light tea.  Thank you for sharing.

Mmmm so good! I can't wait to try it with berries next time. I replace the amaretto for Grand Marnier. The other reviewer is right this is a very light delicious little cake. Thanks for sharing your recipe eatcookdream!

Happy to be the first reviewer of this recipe, and even happier to be able to give it the 5 stars that it deserves! What a fabulous cake! I made it exactly as the recipe states, no need to make any adjustments. I love the ground almonds and amaretto in here. My husband is not a big dessert eater, but I know he is going to like this, as it is not overly sweet. Thanks for sharing your recipe eatcookdream!

So I was the dumb head that doubled the recipe and put it into a Springform Pan. And then...... baked it and baked it and sweated bullets and baked it. I THINK it was an hour total between the peaking, sweating, and praying to the kitchen gods. 
Moist, delicious ,rich, pleasantly textured cake that melts on your tongue. Only thing I did different was to use whole almonds and blanch them myself. Well that and the tempting of the ratio fates. Gorgeous recipe! Thank You eatcookdream and the kitchen gods!!!!!

BAKING Time is too Long! Check at 15 amd 20 mins, burns easily. 
I didn't have amaretto but needed a quick elegant dessert so I used merlot wine. Worked nicely although a but pink! :) added almond slivers and half a diced pear to batter as well. Of you add, use parchment paper, fuit tends to stick on bottom. Tasty outcome even though almost burned.

This is good but I think it will be better the second day. I will make this again and use a second pear. I also want to try this with other fruits.r

This was really good; great delicate almond and pear. flavors.  My pear was ripe, a little past firm, but worked out very well.  I did not have amaretto, so used anisette, which worked very well.  My husband would have actually liked a little stronger almond or pear flavor, and I wonder if a little almond extract or pear liqueur would work.  Or maybe two pears?

A very easy and delicious cake. Light not too sweet - served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Lovely. Made it exactly as directed. It looked beautiful too.

I made it exactly as said, except that I made it in a cake pan. It did turn out thinner and tart like, but that just made me wish I'd made more of it! Will definitely make again.

This cake is delicious. Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe, except I used Disaronno. So good.  I even blanched the almonds. There is no recipe that is too much work. Especially this one. Go for it all you homecooks!

Took too much time.  Dirtied too many dishes/utensils.  Cake was gritty, not cake-like.  Way too long to make and certainly not worth my time or gathering the ingredients.  Sorry.

Made this the first time I joined Allrecipes. Super recipe, even though I had to change the measurements to metric! Our local French friends will love this. Many thanks

I used the ingredients listed and followed the directions exactly; didn't change a single thing. After 20 minutes, it was very dark and pulling away from edges, so I did not cook for the remaining 5 minutes. Within a few moments of removing it from the oven, the parts of it with the pear "dropped", creating a very funny looking dessert (and not so attractive). It did release from the tart pan just fine. I uploaded a photo so that the dark color and dropped effect can be seen.
