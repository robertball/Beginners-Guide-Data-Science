Awesome and easy! I didn't use oil when cooking quinoa and skipped the optional parmesan, it's tasty enough without it. Didn't add any salt per another reviewer, it's easy to add later if wanted. If you're using parmesan it adds a salty taste. This could be made vegan with Not So Chicken broth cubes and homemade cashew parmesan.  Asparagus or pea pods would be a nice addition later in cooking. Edit: After making this a few times I decided to cook the peppers and onions less. The peppers in particular benefit from still having crunch. Read that some like to use coconut oil because it will give a "velvety" texture that you generally will only get from saturated fat (meat).  It definitely seems to add something.  Worth trying if you've been substituting another oil like I was.

This is an easy, tasty recipe! The only important note that I feel is missing from the directions is to RINSE THE QUINOA REALLY WELL BEFORE USING! If you don't, there will be an underlying bitterness that isn't completely covered by the flavors of the recipe. (As you can tell, I forgot to rinse ??.) Thanks, Claudia!

A quick, easy, tasty, and healthy meal. Plan to serve 'Chef John's Meatless Meatballs' with the leftover quinoa tomorrow. Subbed chicken broth for the water/chicken bouillon, and did not add optional Parmesan cheese. Also added about 1 tablespoon Kikkoman Ponzu Lime Sauce. 1 pound of sliced crimini mushrooms equals about 5-1/4 cups, and all of them were used. Will make this again.

Very fragrant, beautiful dish. I used Tri color quinoa, broth instead of boullion cubes, and yellow pepper instead of red.

This was delicious, all the flavor of mushroom risotto in half the time.  I omitted the chicken bouillon to keep it vegetarian and didn't miss it.   Will definitely make it again.

I really like quinoa so I thought I’d try this recipe.  Made exactly as directed. Tastes ok but is not really creamy like risotto-Not enough cheese. Made it as a side for seafood on New Year’s Eve. Ended up using the leftovers as a casserole base the next day, and that worked out better. I think it would be good as a stuffing for bell peppers with extra cheese.

So, I’ve had to do some substitutions because I didn’t have the wine or the bell pepper. I cooked the quinoa (in case I’m not the only confused as together the quinoa should be pre-cooked or not).  I took 2 cups of broth and dissolved the bouillon cube in it before putting 2 cups of the cooked quinoa into it.

I left out the first Tb of coconut oil and used broth instead of bullion.  It was excellent!

I had all of the ingredients except for the wine so I left that out. I also used a green pepper instead of a red one. My husband doesn't like quinoa so I made a batch with brown rice for him and another with quinoa for myself. I will make it again but leave out the first tablespoon of coconut oil as it is not necessary and adds a few too many calories.

This was delicious! I had everything except fresh red pepper, had a jar of fire roasted peppers. This is going in the recipe book.

Fabulous!
"Risotto" is a stretch, but if you like mushrooms, this recipe rocks. Omitted the peppers, and it was still great.  Could easily be a main dish.
