This is awesome. An elegant, absolutely delicious side dish that is very easy to assemble and smells amazing while baking - what more can you ask for? I used a lot more mushrooms than called for, run through the food processor to slice very thin and just a bit more cheese because it was the portion size I bought. Note: sottocenere is not cheap but you need very little to give a BIG taste punch. I also left a little of the peel on the potatoes as I like the added texture. Do let the casserole sit for 10 minutes or so to set up. Guests raved about it and nothing was left. One thing: I would prefer that the potatoes be given in pounds rather than number because size varies so much. But thanks for this great, easy recipe. It's a definite keeper!!

Made exactly as written except I couldn't find the Sottocenere cheese looked online and saw you could substitute Fontina cheese. It got rave reviews! Will be making this again. Thanks Chef John.

Making for Christmas Dinner. I am such a Chef John aficionado I goggled "incredibly cheap Chinese Mandolin" and got one for ten bucks from Bed Bath and Beyond. Found Truffle  Cheese at my near by Mollie Stones. used jar thyme cause though I had the fresh but I just got lazy. 5 Russets made a lot of potatoes so we will have the rest tomorrow morning with sausage for breakfast. Now baking away and I love it!

AMAZING!!  I am on a truffle kick at the moment - spreading truffle butter on my bagel and pizza crust, and anything else I can find, including my fingertips. Also thanks for the tip on the cheese.  I got something similar at Trader Joes, but it was not quite as good.

As always, Chef John puts out great information.  Don't worry if you can't find certain things, (except heavy cream, no switching:) his recipes are meant to keep it pretty simple for us average joe's.  Tried this one out substituting cheeses but it was still great.  I did find a truffle oil spray at the store, completely out of the blue so used it.

This is the best potato’s au gratin I’ve ever had!    I added a little shaved sweet onion in the layers with the mushrooms.  Because of the comments about it being too milky or liquidy I made a roux with butter and flour then added the cream and dissolved the cheese in that.  It was a little thick so I diluted with some chicken broth and then poured a little over each layer as I went.    Cooked for 1 hr 15 min then added the extra cheese on the top with some Panko.   Under the broiler for about 5 min and this came out perfect.  Better than any fancy restaurants!    The sottocerene was amazing in this.  I also added a little Gruyere cheese too.   Soooo good!  Thank you Chef John!!!??

Great tasting but really, really soupy.  Maybe my sliced, rinsed potatoe slices added to the liquid content , or the heavy cream should have been whipped to thicken???

Delicious! It was a last minute decision to make this and no cheese stores would have been open, so instead I used provolone and drizzled truffle oil at each layer and that worked really well. I found it was just a trifle too much liquid, but that could just be that my '5 large potatoes' weren't large enough.  Would definitely recommend this as a treat.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good!  I used a combination of three different mushrooms and the truffled cheese.  So very good.

What's not to like about cheese and potatoes?  I couldn't find any sottocenere so I used a local truffled sheep cheese.  The taste was good but there was a lot of oil produced.  Next time I'll blot while it sits before serving.  I'm sure it'll be 5-star great the next time.

Chef John, I made this recipe to the “T”. Best hands down I’ve ever had or made. Seriously thank you for sharing your recipes in only “Chef John’s” way. I had this with your Recipe “Prison style meatloaf”.. really good.

These were good, but took 2 hours to bake. When I took them out at 1 hour, the spuds were still raw. I also listened to what other reviewers noted, I only used 1 cup stock and 1/2 cup of heavy cream, which worked out better I feel. I did use the sottocenere, but will not again . Taste was ok, but it’s way too expensive for a potato dish.  Fontina will work next time!

While this tastes fantastic,  it was soupy and the thin mandolin sliced potatoes came out undercooked at 350 degrees. 

Next time I'll try baking them at 450 - 475 degrees and combine the chicken stock with the cream and pour over before baking.  The sottocenere cheese gave it a wonderful flavor.  I want to master this because it taste so good.

The sottocenere truffle cheese is pricey and pretty hard to find.  But I found it and made the recipe as directed.  We loved it. I might try other cheeses in the future as suggested by other reviewers.

Made it for Easter!  It was a big hit!  Everyone had seconds it was easy to make and my Mom called it "Gourmet tasting"  It turned out a little more liquid that I wanted but still was finger licking good!

Great take on traditional potatoes au gratin but had to make a few changes... First off, even if I could find the sottocenere truffle cheese, the price was way out of my grocery budget, so a nice wedge of softened fontina and some grated aged cheddar worked perfectly. Next I used new red potatoes instead of the russets and also a mix of mushrooms; oyster, crimni, shitake and baby bellas. Nothing too exotic but gave the dish a real distinctive flavor. Make sure to add some white wine to the oil-butter mixture when sauteing the 'shrooms! The dish turned out to be the hit of Easter dinner!

Made this today for Easter and it was wonderful-everyone loved it. Couldn't find this particular cheese so substituted with smoked Gouda and thyme pesto jack and used baby portobellos and button mushrooms. Very yummy and definitely will make again soon!
