This was a great recipe! I followed most of the ingredients and directions but of course I made a few changes as well. I added fresh mushrooms, used only half an onion, an extra 1/2 cup of milk and then mixed the dry bread crumbs with 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese then sprinkled on top. Other reviews noted that it tasted bland so I added 1 tbs of Lowry Seasoning Salt, pinch of garlic powder, pinch of Italian seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also cooked it in the oven for longer for 30 mins instead of 20 so that the mushrooms and onions could cook all the way through. Besides that the family loved it! Definitely is a keeper :)

The flavor of this casserole was very good, but it was very dry.  The only thing I did different was sautee the chopped onion in some butter first.  The next time I make this, I will use less noodles.  But, it was an easy weeknight dinner and with a little bit of tweaking, this could be a 5 star recipe!

Easy and tasty!  I like my casseroles pretty creamy so I used less noodles and a touch more milk.  Also, I had no canned veggies, but was happy to saute onion and steam some carrots instead.  Also, I used homemade garlic basil bread crumbs.

I changed a few things, I didn't have mushrooms to add so I just did peas and I sauteed onions in butter THEN added them.  I also added a little cayenne pepper, parsley, garlic powder, to give it a zing.  for the breadcrumbs I added parm cheese.  I tried it before I put it in the oven :)  it was tasty then so I hold high hopes for when its warm

Excellent.  I omitted the chopped onion, added a drained jar of sliced mushrooms and a tablespoon of Worcestershire.  Everyone wanted more.  Thanks Trish.

Family really like this dish.  Had to tweek a little.  We do not use canned veggies so while the noodles were cooking I added frozen peas.  Also added the onion after someone had mentioned in a review that the onion had not cooked enough. Only added the 1 onion since a review had mentioned there was to much onion flavour and it overpowered the dish.  I also added about 1 tbsp of dryed dill.   No salt just pepper.  Will be making again.

Ok I made this recipe a few days ago. It really wasn't bad. I didn't add peas because I don't care for them and I used fresh mushrooms that I had leftover from another recipe. It was very quick and easy to make but just a tad bland (the peas don't make a difference in my book) but I still enjoyed it!

Loved this recipe!!  Because my Husband has to watch is salt intake.  I made my own mushroom soup but added French fried onions on top instead of bread crumbs.

I read so very many recipes here ...I used this one but tweeted it thusly...used a large can of albacore tuna(drained), 2 cans Mushroom Soup, 1cup frozen peas(added to boiling noodles wi th  5 min. left in cooking time, 2C Shredded Cheddar Cheese and 1C  buttered bread crumbs.  When mixing the ingredients of recipe together I added 1C of the shredded cheddar.  On the top of the casserole I added the other cup of cheddar and topped it all with the buttered bread crumbs.  I baked it uncovered at 425* for 20 minutes.  I will follow this recipe again because it’s outta this world!!!

I use this as a base recipe most every week. You can use pretty much any kind of condensed soup that you have around and I used mixed vegetables for ease and don’t add milk if you like your casseroles less soupy.

In my opinion this is the only true tuna casserole on here. Sure, variations are fun, but the original has a charm all it's own!

This wasn't bad, but it was a little bland for my taste. I have other tuna casserole recipes that I prefer so I would not make this again. The only change I made was to omit the onion, because frequently onion does not appeal to me. And I'm not sure that the peas with mushrooms and onions were any better than a simple can of peas would have been.

I have always loved tuna casserole since I was a kid. This recipe is pretty close to how my mom made it then. I am quite happy with the way this casserole turned out for me. I followed the recipe....except I only used half a large onion, a can of plain peas, and I grated cheese over the top before the bread crumbs. I baked for 20 minutes and tried it. It was yummy, I think I will sautee the onions before adding them next time though. Otherwise, I'll make this recipe again and again. It's super easy and the ingredients are always on hand in my kitchen.

I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture and also added about a half a cup of shredded cheese on top with the breadcrumbs. I also use a coarse Normandie sea salt when I serve. Delicious!

I added about 2 cups of fat free chicken broth with cornstarch. I also added a couple teaspoons of garlic powder and about a half a cup of Parmesan cheese.  Adds flavor and makes it less dry.

A good idea, but the amounts of ingredients were all wrong. Way too many noodles and peas. I drained the tuna and peas as there would have been an almighty sloppy mess. I also sautéed the onions and pearl onions as they would have been pretty crunchy otherwise.

This is a great receipe to add a little more flair I added:

1/2 cup mozzerella cheese
2 tablespoons of garlic powder
and instead of bread crumbs I put panko with parmesian cheese on the top

My kids love this!

I picked this recipe because it sounded most like what I had as a kid, and I liked that it didn't require putting the bread crumbs in melted butter and adding them at the end. I made a few changes, some due to personal preference and some because of what I had on hand. I used 12 ounces of tuna, 2 cans of cream of celery soup (love celery, hate mushrooms), only had regular peas, substituted chicken broth for milk because I was out of milk. Also added some minced garlic and paprika. The flavor and texture were excellent. It was not hot when it came out of the oven. I thought I had left it in for an extra ten minutes (waiting for the bread crumbs to brown (they didn't), but now I see there is a discrepancy on time. Under #3 it says to bake about 20 minutes, in the box where it says Prep, Cook, and Ready In - it says to cook for 30 minutes. So apparently the 30 minutes I had left it in was only as long as it was supposed to be. Still, it should have been hot. I've done a lot of baking recently and I know my oven is accurate. Maybe this should be baked for 45 minutes, or maybe it should be baked at 400. Not sure.  When done the bread crumbs were just laying there on top of the casserole. I'm going to make this again because it's so good, but I am going to either leave the bread crumbs off, or do the melted butter thing. Also, for my taste, it could use even more tuna.
