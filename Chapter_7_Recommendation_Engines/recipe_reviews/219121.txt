One of the better green bean recipes I've ever made. Used real dairy butter rather than "buttery taste margarine," shallots rather than onion, regular rather than fat-free reduced-sodium chicken broth and no lemon juice.  And salt and pepper of course.

Amazing!!! I made this with a steak and baked potatoes dinner and it was soooo yummy.. My new fav green beans recipe ! I followed all of the directions, however, I used fresh green beans from the farmers market, regular butter, chicken broth and let the green beans simmer in the broth, onions and garlic for a bit longer than the 6 mins it says. I used half of a large yellow onion and about two cloves of garlic. I used a little more than a pound of fresh green beans so it def was not too much onion and garlic. It came out perfect.  It was amazing, my whole family loved it.. I will def make again !

These had a nice fresh bright flavor. I liked the garlic in this. It wasn't strong at all. I used unsalted butter, canned green beans, dried minced onion, chicken boullion granules, and lemon pepper. I only used a couple of tablespoons of dried onion. I know that even half an onion would have been way way too much onion for my tastes. Easy and a nice way to add some different flavor in an everyday veggie.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I like green beans anyway, but it's nice to see how someone else prepares them.  I used the whole young beans and real butter, but eliminated the lemon juice.  As always with green beans, it's important to let the liquid cook away, putting the flavor back on the beans.

This was fantastic!  I am not a good cook.  I can easily destroy a box of kraft dinner. But this was super easy to make and easy on the waist line.  Not a fan of lemon juice so I chose not to use it.  I think this will become a staple in our house.

These green beans were okay as is. I ended up having to add 3 or 4 other items or flavorings. I would have thought onions, garlic, and broth would be enough. I might like this with broccoli. The flavorings as suggested just didnt flavor fresh green beans enough for me.
