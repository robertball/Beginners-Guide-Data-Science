I made these cookies for christmas in place of my usual gingerbread cookies. My entire family loved them. One warning, they are pretty spicy (by this I mean heat). I think with less cayenne pepper they would be more tolerable for people who are sensitive to this (like me).

These cookies are great! For me they also turned out softer with a smaller yield (but that is why I chose this recipe). I also added another pinch of ginger and used ground cardamom instead of the cayenne pepper.

These cookies were a little too rich with butter for my taste. I liked the spice but I would prefer more "snap" to my gingersnaps. Thanks for the recipe though.

Nice cookies.  I omitted the cayenne as I can't handle it and upped the ginger to a well-rounded tsp.  I also rolled them in confectioner's sugar.  They're better warm, but still very good once they're cool.

These were really good cookies with a kick! Traditional gingersnap taste with a kick from the cayenne pepper that is just right! My house smelled so good while I was baking these. I didn't get 48 servings out of my batter though, I think next time I will make the balls smaller and flatten them out more as I like crisper gingersnaps.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made them without the ceyanne, cloves and nutmeg because I didn't have any and they were a little bland but not bad. Also, making each cookie 2 tablespoons is two big. I only got about 12 cookies and they were kind of burnt on the bottom and doughy on the top. I would say about 1 teaspoon and also watch them closely so they don't burn.

Decent, but skip the cayenne pepper and roll them in sugar before baking.  Makes little bite-sized cookies.

These came out absolutely delicious! I liked the kick, but I added a bit of extra ginger to get it. Also, molasses isn't sold where I live, so I had to substitute pure maple syrup for it and they still came out great. There weren't as many as the recipe said there would be, so maybe I'll make them smaller the next time.

I'm the one who put this recipe up. Thanks for trying! You're right, the texture of the dough is a little strange. I do roll the balls very, very small :) The texture of the cookie is pretty different from most, too--more dense. Thanks for the picture!

These do not taste like cookies at all. They're okay, if you aren't expecting them to taste like gingersnaps. I don't plan to make these again.

I made these just as written.  Unfortunately, I cooked them too long (longer than the directions called for).  They came out very soft but hardened.  And I definitely only got half the amount of cookies the recipe called for, even though I made them extremely small.  The cookies don't spread.  Great flavor, but be careful not to use too much cayenne.
