Cool recipe. I used what I had on hand so no green onion, hot sauce or savory- instead chopped yellow onion, garlic, and thyme. An extra egg white helped the cakes stick together perfectly. This recipe is very variable, cheap, and easy to make.

This sounded really weird when I read the recipe, but I was desperate for something to do with canned tuna besides a tuna noodle casserole.  I thought it was decent, and I would have given it four stars.  I added the extra star because my extremely picky ten-year-old daughter said it was great, and she NEVER says that about anything.  The first time I made it I didn't have any barbecue sauce, so I made a mix of catsup, brown sugar, vinegar, spices and seasonings, and it was even good that way.

I was a bit surprised that BBQ sauce and oatmeal would work with tuna... but I have made these a few times now for my family, and they are always a hit.  I've found that using a slightly sweet, Kansas City-style BBQ sauce provides better flavor with the tuna than a Texas-style, spicy BBQ sauce--at least in my family's opinion.  Don't be tempted to flip them before they are nicely browned on the first side, or else they're more likely to fall apart.  Even if they do fall apart, though, they're still tasty, and I like to sprinkle the broken bits over fresh salad greens for a nice, light lunch.

This is an odd recipe. I like the flavor of barbeque sauce and I like the flavor of canned tuna. Together it doesn't work: it's way over the top barbeque sauce flavor, and I even cut it back to two tablespoons. You really can't taste the tuna.

I wanted this to be good because it is very easy to make, but it misses the mark. I think canned tuna requires more delicate flavoring. In fact, this recipe would probably be better with no BBQ sauce, but then the name would have to be changed! You know what, just fry 'em up and serve with mayo mixed with a little dill instead.

Hubby loved these. I divided the mixture into four parts, and the patties stayed together nicely. Don't try to form patties before you put them in the pan, just spoon & pat like the directions say.

Great keeper recipe! I made these exactly as the recipe says and they turned out wonderful, even to my picky family. The only thing I didn't do was add the savory because I forgot to do so. I don't think it altered the taste that much. The BBQ taste was not overwhelming and just added a nice addition to the flavor. You could definitely still taste the tuna. Making the patties small as the recipe calls for helps keep them together well. We used these in wrap sandwiches and they were a healthy, quick dinner.

I really liked this recipe!  I made a few changes, and it turned out great! Instead of using plain "canned" tuna, I used a "hickory smoked" variety from a "pouch".  Then, I sprinkled a little lemon-pepper seasoning on top of each fritter while they were cooking.  I finished it with a creole sauce made from creole mustard, mayonaise, lemon juice, some black pepper, and a little hot sauce.  It really gave it a "New Orleans" kind of feel.  I will definitely make these again.

I was a little leary when I read the title of this recipe, but it was wonderful!  My husband even enjoyed it.  I made a few minor changes because I didn't have everything on hand.  Instead of hot pepper sauce I used a few dashes of hot sauce.  I didn't have savory so I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of thyme.  The fritters turned out delicious!  I put them in whole wheat pita pockets stuffed with lettuce and drizzled them with ranch dressing.  I got 5 small patties out of the recipe.  Next time I will make 4 patties so they will be slightly larger.  It was a quick and easy dish to prepare.  I will be making these in the future.

8.25.11'Tried this with leftover salmon using 1/3c breadcrumbs, no savory.  It was okay.  Not a big salmon fan.  The barbecue sauce made it taste grilled.  Nice, I guess.  I'll try it with tuna.1.30.12: Tried w 12oz tuna & 1c oat flour.  'Didn't even make it to the pan.  1 1/4c oats make 1c oat flour, but ... don't try it.  :)

Needed something new as it's lent and we're eating fish. These are okay... although my husband and son said they really like them. I used two cans of tuna and left the rest the same except I did not have green onions but did add some onion powder. Just fried in a pan with Pam as I was trying to keep the fat down. Would like to try again with some more spice. Thanks

Oh my goodness! This was so delicious, I couldn’t believe it! At first, when I read the title I thought that it sounded strange. But then I read some of the positive reviews this dish received and was intrigued so I decided to make it. It is a delectable combination of tuna, oats, barbeque sauce, green onion, and other seasonings. They are then pan fried into patties. If you decide to make this, don’t be afraid of getting it a golden brown on each side to add a slight crisp. Cilantro pairs perfectly with this dish. I will be making this again.

WOW! These are really good.  I followed the recipe excatly except for the savory.  I made the patties thin and coated them in cornmeal to make them extra crispy when I fried them in olive oil. Served on buns with lettuce and cheese.  Will definiely make again.

I have to give this 5 stars and here's why.  I doubled the tuna in this recipe.  Seems so healthy for you.  I thought it was fine.  I can see it tasting better with lettuce, tomato and mayo on pita.  I'd go with LESS oatmeal too or maybe that's just me.    However, to noses that usually wrinkle at my cooking attempts in this house.... my husband like it so much, he took the leftovers for lunch the next day and loved it even better then!  Thanks for sharing!

These were alot better than I  thought. To honest  with  you  if you  would  have told me BBQ sauce and tuna together was a great combo I would have asked if you  are having  a baby. I did add a little more seasonings to  them will trying  these again.

This was great and so cheap and easy.  I put a little extra tabasco sauce in and some red pepper flakes to spice it up some more, and with tomatoes, red onion,   pickles and a little mayo on a bun it hit the spot.  I think next time I might put a spoonful or two of Carribean Jerk sauce in there as well... Thanks for something cheap and easy!

These were good, my husband and I enjoyed them. (Our 3-year-old spit it out, unfortunately.) The tuna flavor is there but not strong; we did add a couple cloves of garlic and used 2/3 of the savory, which was plenty. :) We scaled the recipe up to 6 people, which was more than enough to feed two hungry adults with plenty left over for snacking; next time I'd scale it up to 4 people. We served it in whole-wheat pitas with ranch dressing, lettuce, and tomatoes.

Worked great in a pinch.  Used Thyme and a little sage instead of the savory and worked great.

My husband is a fussy eater, and my kids weren't sure about the name, but it's become a big hit! I left out the onions, hot sauce, and savory. I also fried half in olive oil and baked the other half. We couldn't make up our minds which we liked best. Thank you! So easy to make and it will become a family regular!

Wow!!! I was very skeptical of this recipe, but I decided to follow the recipe as close as possible.  I did not have savory and added more barbecue sauce.  The onions I diced into the smallest I possibly could.  My son ate them up so fast and I was taste testing them while cooking and could not keep my hands off them! Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was simple and good.  The oats were a surprisingly delicious ingredient.  I was unsure, but I put in the full amount and it turned out awesome!

Wow, I was not expecting this to taste so good.
My husband doesn't like canned tuna but really enjoyed these patties.
I had to substitute bbq sauce(didn't have any) for sriracha chilli sauce ( it's got  heat and is sweet)
I cooked them using coconut oil which gave them a lovely flavour ????
Thanks for the recipe, I will
definitely make these again.

My kids gobble this up like there is no tomorrow!! And they won't eat tuna otherwise! I am definitely pleased with this recipe. I almost never have green onions so I don't ever add them. Might not sound appealing just reading it- but you will be pleasantly surprised!

I had to use white onion instead of green onion, and it was still fantastic. I have also been trying to incorporate turmeric into our diet so I used that instead of savory salt, and it is delicious. Very happy I found this recipe, thanks for sharing!

I was shocked at how good this was! Instead of oats, I used Panko bread crumbs. Also, I made a sauce to put on top which consisted of mayo (Miracle Whip), hot sauce, and pepper. It was delicious! It will definitely be something I'll make again.

I found this to be a really great and interesting recipe!  I was looking for something without the mayo in it and this hit the mark for me.  I substituted yellow onions for green and I used a little Italian seasoning since I didn't have any savory or thyme.  I also used a honey BBQ because other people wrote not to use a spicy BBQ against the mild flavor of the tuna.  I will definately make this again....next time for the family.  It will be a great lenten recipe for my family and a great staple for me with my health kicks!  Thanks!

This is a terrific recipe, both as written and adjusted.
 I have been making it for years, literally, and you can change it up in so many ways  (let your taste buds be your guide).  It's quick and easy and you can dress it up as much as you like.
Everybody doesn't like everything (some people don't like chocolate!) but it's more than worth trying !

It was amazing! I made some substitues. Didn't use savory, choped green onions or salt. Used: BBQ sauce, Chipotle Hot Pepper Sauce, Italian Seasoning & Garlic Powder. Ate them with crackers. Also if you don't have eggs, use 1 tsp baking powder + 1 1/2 TBS water + 1 1/2 TBS oil And enjoy!

These were surprisingly good. Tasted similar to how BBQ pulled pork would taste. I used bread crumbs instead of oats though and an extra egg like other reviewers suggested. Also didn't have hot pepper sauce so I just added some red pepper.

Didn't have any quick cook oats so had to use flour.  Even my husband who doesn't like tuna wanted more.  I will be making these again hopefully trying the oats but using flour they still get a 5 from me.

Though I was a little put off by the idea of tuna nd BBQ sauce, I must say these were quite tasty. I did decrease the BBQ by half and didnt have any savory and we dont do anything hot so no hot pepper sauce and per other reviewers used fat free cooking spray instead. They were really good and very filling. We will be having them again! Probably gonna try adding green peppers next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is super easy & quick to make.  I used 2/3 bread crubs for the oats since I didn't have any onhand & left out the green onions and savory.  The flavor was nice & sweet.  Next time I will try with 12 oz. can tuna, 2 tbls bbq, 1 extra egg white, garlic powder & all season salt for a little bit more tuna flavor.

This was pretty good for a quick meal, but I think next time I'd like to try using bread crumbs in place of some or all of the oats - I kept getting the taste and texture of oats and it didn't seem to fit with tuna.  I served in pita pockets with lettuce, sliced sweet onion and a little more BBQ sauce.  Will make again, but will probably  tweak to our preferences.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum,Yum.  I left out the green onions because I didn't have any and I didn't know what savory was so I added 1 t. Salt & Spice, 1 t. Spicy Pepper, 1/2 t. ground pepper.  It was delicious!  I ate mine in a wrap with mayo, tomato & lettuce but my kids ate them plain.  This is a definite keeper. Thanks!

I gave this 5 stars because I am able to make this for dinner between work and the kids ball games. It only takes minutes to prepare and cook (about the same as a few grilled cheese sandwiches)and the kids loved it. Thanks for the time saver!!!!

When I was a kid we ate a dish of tuna, egg and soda crackers all scrambled together.  I'd put ketchup on mine. Alas, my husband just couldn't like it.  Well, Tee Hee, it's basically tuna and egg with the oats subst. for crackers.  He even eats them leftover straight out of the fridge.  I do add the green onion and a little garlic, too.  It's tasty with most any sauce. Such a great quick dish to make, too.

I forgot to use the egg and it still came out fine, and it has less fat that way. I also used garlic cooking spray. I had some leftover smoked catfish, so I flaked that up w/ the canned tuna and only added 1/2 cup of the oats. Everyone really enjoyed this and it is a great recipe for Lent and we have tons of canned tuna in the pantry...This is my favorite tuna recipe so far. Thanks!

Yum!  I did do a few things differently (used more hot sauce instead of BBQ, omitted green onions and savory, and added some ginger and corn) according to taste, but these were fast(er than 25 minutes), easy, and hit the spot.

These are really good, we make them into tuna burgers. When they are almost done cooking I add a slice of tomato and a slice of cheese on top and cover it so that the cheese melts on the burger.

Love this recipe, even though I'm usually not a BBQ fan.  Turns out way better when you use good BBQ sauce (my fave is Sweet Baby Rae's), and it's a really easy meal if you serve it with mac and cheese and a veggie.

Tasty, easy to make. This is a great way to eat tuna if people are not keen on the tuna taste. I did add an extra can of tuna as I felt otherwise it was mostly breadcrumbs (which I used as I did not have the oatmeal stuff). A wonderful flavour and I will certainly be making this again. My husband liked it more than tuna casserole, which until now was almost the only way to get tuna into him. Thank you.

Made these as a quick supper for myself. No savory, and I added about a tablespoon each of Tony Chachere's and garlic powder. They were very good and I'll definitely make them again! Next time I will add another egg white to help them keep their shape, mine were very crumbly. I think I'll also lower the heat and cook them a bit longer. They were very quick- less than thirty minutes in all.

This is SO good. Hot sauce is essential! Turns out better if you use foil-packed tuna, but it's also more expensive.  Kids love it, so does dad!

I used tuna packed in water, as that is what I had on hand. Patties were a little dry, But I'll try with tuna in oil next time.

These were really good!  I doubled the recipe and I had no problems at all with mine sticking together well and forming perfect patties.  I was able to shape mine by hand and they held together very nicely and cooked up great.  The only thing I left out was the savory because I had none.  Next time I might add a touch more bbq sauce, but it was also tasty to just dip them in a touch of extra sauce on the side.  Very happy with these.  They really cut down on the strong tuna flavor.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  It will certainly be going into our rotation!

Definitely something different and really good! I have made it for my lunch and ended up with enough for two lunches! If you like tuna and just want a little variety in your life give this one a try!

I don't usually like tuna but since my husband does, I made these one day for lunch. I put them on a bun and ate them like a burger. They didn't have that "tuna fish" taste.

well, all i can say is that these were just ok. interesting recipe, but i had to make a few changes. after mixing everything up (sans savory, didn't have any so i substituted a dash of dried thyme) i realized there was no way these were going to hold together in the frying process. i added an extra egg, about a Tbs. of dried breadcrumbs, and a pinch of baking powder. i also added some seasoning salt and garlic powder to make up the flavor a bit, especially with the additions. they fried up pretty well (only one fell apart a bit) but the flavor was just kida off. i don't know how to describe it better. they were edible, but not a recipe i will try again. thanks anyway, had fun making and tweaking!

I looked at this recipie and though 'nah, its way too easy to be any good'. I missed out the onion and salt and this recipie was fantastic!  I also used oat bran instead of quick cooking oats (all i had on hand) and it still turned out fine, I found a little extra oats was needed then stated but other wise this is a fantastic quick mean / snack and you would never believe you are eating canned tuna!!

I make these ahead of time and keep them in the freezer for a healthy protein snack. When I need something quick, I just microwave them for about 30 seconds.  I do not use savory, so I don't know if that affects the outcome.  These are a good, cheap, and easy nutritious recipe.

This a great new way to use tuna. My whole family enjoyed this tasty dish. Although, my husband ate it with worchestershire sauce on the side, he went back for seconds. It was a hit!

I ave this recipe 4 stars. I liked it alot and added it to my dinner meal menu. I added a little bread crumbs to my mixture about a tablespoon or so and it stayed together very well for me. I served it with tropical coleslaw (a youtube recipe), and I also cut the centers of slices of bread with a biscuit cutter and toasted them lightly on top the stove. They made the meal more filling. My hubby and I really enjoyed it and the bbq sauce kind of made me forget I was eating tuna. So its on the menu a few more times. Thanks for sharing this

I was really surprised at how well the BBQ sauce went with the tuna.  I never would have thought to put the two together.  Very good. I have made these several times.

Tasted good, but a little bland. I took out some BBQ and put no hot sauce at all and it kind of lost all flavor. Stephen said it tasted just like bread (but the boys ate it). So, next time, less oatmeal, more BBQ, add some garlic salt or something, and use some hot sauce.

These were good! A fast, cheap alternative to a salmon patty. I used a reg onion since I did not have green, and skipped the savory seasoning and hot sauce.

I was a bit hesitant as I was mixing the ingredients, though once my friends and I took a bite - wow, we were hooked. I didn't have any savory and it certainly didn't affect our taste buds.

I thought I'd experiment with these to see if the bf would like them, since they have bbq sauce in them.  Nope, he didn't.  He tried a piece and said they were "gross".  I don't agree that they're gross--they're fine on sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, and mustard, but I won't be making them again since he's the bbq fan and I'm not so much of one.  Thanks for the creative recipe!

I used a sweetened smoky flavored bbq sauce and instead of savory I used seasoned salt. The result was a crispy fritter that tasted almost like a char grilled burger! A great red meat substitute. Thank you for sharing this!

These are absolutely delicious.  I enjoy them alone, without the pita or lettuce, but my husband prefers them with pita.  Make sure to get a brand of barbecue sauce that you know you like because that is the basis for the flavor of your tuna fritters.

I tripled the recipe and used a yellow onion and instant pre-packaged oatmeal because that is what I had on hand and it turned out great.  My only problem was that the first batch burned on the bottom so I had to turn heat down to med/low.

This is a great recipe for those who don't like tuna.  I don't mean this in a bad way, but the barbecue sauce pretty much masks the tuna taste.  They're a fast and easy dish that tastes good but is not spectacular.
