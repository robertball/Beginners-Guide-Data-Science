OH MY YUM! This might just be my new favorite go-to recipe for roast. First off, it's incredibly easy. Secondly, it cooks in an oven bag, so no mess! Lastly, it's incredibly moist and full of flavor. Convinced yet? Just try it! I made the recipe exactly as written. I'm not a big fan of ground ginger, but I used it anyway and I couldn't even really taste it - I may just omit it next time. Still a winner recipe in this house!  All the flavors are really subtle.   I used a 2.5lb roast and it cooked about 1hr 15mins, only because I was a little late coming home. Even still, it was incredibly juicy. I may have eaten a bit too much. :)

The only thing it did differently was let the pork marinade with the spices and wine for about 5 hours. Even with the time spent marinating the only flavor was Rosemary it was ok but I won't make it again.

Didn't want to open a bottle of Chardonnay just for this. Used a moscato instead. Gave it a hint of sweetness that I thought complimented the Pork very well. No bag. Used a small roaster and turned out great.

Oh, was this delicious! Moist and flavorful. I had an open bottle of rose so that's what I used with garlic, rosemary, and salt and pepper. Totally forgot to add the ginger, but I will try it next time.
