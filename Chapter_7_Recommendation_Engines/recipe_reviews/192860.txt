Something was off about the proportions of ingredients in this recipe - definitely too much lime and chile pepper.

I'm all for interesting and unusual flavor combinations, and I love a good sweet/savory dish, but these ingredients just did not work together. Honestly, it tasted like I cleaned out my refrigerator. It needs some type of seasoning to tie everything together. It was also very oniony. I think you'd be better off omitting the edamame (which I love, but which just doesn't blend here) and red peppers, using red onions caramelized in coconut oil, and increasing the salt. Thanks, but this isn't a keeper for me.

tasty! I switched lentils for edamame because I didn't have any on hand, reduced the onions to 3, and used a habanero pepper instead of serrano. Really a nice dish with a Caribbean flair!

A very tasty and unusual pilaf, this recipe took quite a bit of work, but we really enjoyed it.  Even if I never make it again, I will remember this meal.

I omitted the edamame, chile pepper, almonds, cranberries and cilantro. However I did add tomato, cucumber and a scrambled egg with some paprika. It turned inot quite a lovely colorful dish!

Delicious!  I left out the serrano chile pepper and added a dash of chili flakes I had from a delivered pizza.  I served this with italian dressing marinated chicken breasts that I grilled.
