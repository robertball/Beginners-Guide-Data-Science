The texture and flavor were just like store bought ice cream. I added 2 tbsp of matcha and a 3rd yolk (as suggested by another user) and the matcha taste was nice and strong. This had the same matcha ice cream taste that I could get when I lived in Japan. We froze it to get it harder, but it never went rock hard, like most homemade ice creams get in the freezer, which is a huge plus. And I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!

This was the best green tea ice cream I have ever had. I have always disliked green tea ice cream until I had this one. But I changed the cream from dairy cream to coconut milk. And EVERYONE loved it!

Delicious.  I recommend doubling the matcha powder for tea lovers and adding an extra egg yolk.

I loved this recipe. Things I added/changed.... I went with 1 1/2 tablespoons of matcha but will most likely go to 2 tablespoons at least in the future.  I added a dash (1/4 teaspoon) of salt to bring out the flavors.  Used organic whipping cream and used organic half & half instead of plain milk along with farm eggs.  The final texture and flavor was so close to store bought without the chemicals and preservatives.  This ice cream base is the best one I've ever used.  I plan on using this base from now on for any homemade ice cream.  It's one that never got "crunchy-hard" in the freeze the way other homemade ice cream can get.

Please read reviews! I put 3 or so tablespoons of matcha.  One is not enough and is a waste. I've had matcha ice cream in japan and if you want it to taste authentic you could get away with 5 tablespoons of matcha. I also added an extra egg yolk and cooked till I got a mixture which coated my spoon.

Please make sure to add more matcha powder with this recipe, also sift the mixture when it’s still warm(more creamy texture). I added half tablespoon of vanilla bean paste and 3 more tablespoons of matcha powder. To keep the bitter taste from matcha, I used 1/2 cup of sugar(maybe 1/4 cup next time, still too sweet) , extra matcha powder on top of the ice cream! 

The matcha powder I’m using is from the  Yame Hoshino village, really recommend it, they produces great quality tea there and suitable with any dairy produce.



commented by an asian tea sommelier that drinks matcha everyday.:-P

Definitely add extra Matcha powder for a more intense flavor. I followed the reviews and added an extra egg yolk as well and it seemed to work out well.

This is a great recipe, but as others have mentioned it's good to add more matcha.  I used 3 tbsp instead of 1.

Delicious! Though I doubled the amount of matcha in the recipe. I also make mine dairy-free using lactose free milk. Turned out amazing!

I decided to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract - saw on another recipe.  I may eliminate this in the future in order to let the team flavor dominate.  I used 2 tablespoons of Matcha powder.  I might consider adding 1/2 tbs more next time. 
Used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 cup half and half  instead of 1 c milk as called for.  Also added 1/8 c vanilla flavored vodka prior to pouring into ice cream machine to keep the final product from freezing too solid in the freezer.  This is a typical addition to all of my ice cream recipes.... and it works! 

Really liked the end result except that is was a little too sweet. Will cut the sugar in half next time.  Will also add an egg yolk as suggested by another - for richness.

Will make again. Two tweaks:
1) Converting sugar to granulated sugar substitute (I do this successfully ALL THE TIME due to medical dietary paramaters) made the finished product HUGELY too sweet, not only for me (with the medical issue) but also for my spouse (skinny as a stuffed string and genuinely cannot taste the difference between real sugar and sugar subs). Next time I will cut the sweetener by 1/3 and see what happens.  
2) Spouse and I both like a STRONG matcha flavor, so I doubled the amount. Most of that stuck to container walls as I transferred various stages of the mixture from measuring cups to mixer bowls to saucepan. There has GOT to be a more streamlined process that does not waste so much (expensive) flavor!

Very good but need to double the matcha powder, flavor was too weak.   I should have listened to the other reviews.

I did use 2 tablespoons of matcha as suggested by some. I serves small sugar cookies with it. 2 of 4 people did not like the matcha taste at all but felt it was fine when eating the cookie along side. It was a fine ice cream recipe that could be easily changed up with different flavoring,
