My main problem with this salad is that it is bland.  It is pretty sweet, despite the nuts.  I added a little vinaigrette to some of the salad, and it did help, but usually I prefer to flavor this type of salad with herbs instead of fats.  I ended up adding salt, chili powder, and onions but it still fell a little flat--big kudos for the massive amount of vitamin A, though:)

This was a great salad.  I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts because I've been eating a lot of walnuts and I suddenly couldn't face any more of them.  I also only had one mango, but it was huge and it didn't seem like I needed more. I also added some chopped red onion.  I dressed the salad with a sugar free raspberry vinaigrette and my husband and I devoured the entire bowl.  Thanks so much for the post!

This salad is very good. It  could use a salad dressing. Try using equal amounts of raspberry vinaigrette, olive oil and white vinegar.

This salad is a beautiful combination I would not have put together myself.  I'm so glad I tried it!  (Have to admit, I left out the carrot - the color just didn't seem right in this beautiful salad).  We don't like our salads dry so mixed up a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar with a few teaspoons of brown sugar, dash of salt and pepper, to taste.   Wonderful tangy sweet salad.  Edit - we tried spinach and mixed greens and liked it even better!  I would highly recommend using those instead of red leaf lettuce.

This is a good combination of colorful, delicious ingredients.  However, it is much better with a dressing.  I made a light vinegar and oil dressing using citrus balsamic vinegar and lemon flavored olive oil.  Hoping for leftovers, the bowl was empty at the end of the potluck.

I love salads with fruit in them. I had a mango I needed to use and found this recipe. So glad I did. Sara, the submitter, suggested we leave it plain or serve it with our favorite vinaigrette. I usually prefer a white balsamic vinegar dressing, but this time I added a light cream cheese-orange dressing I had made for another salad and it was delicious.
