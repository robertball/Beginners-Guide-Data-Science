I loved the recipe although I did change a few things.  The beef ramah noodles changed to chicken.  The sunflower seeds became almonds.  The olive oil was vegetable or canola oil and the splenda became sugar.  Everone said mine was exceptional and would I bring it to all the parties so I guess it was great either way.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this recipe is fantastic!  I would have given it 5 stars, but I made some changes.  Don't do anything to the ramen other than break it up and mix it in.  Plus I put in almonds and sunflower seeds, which was good, and I increased the sugar, olive oil, and vingar to 4 Tbs.  It turned out fantastic and I got a ton of compliments on it.  My husband has been talking about it constantly.  plus, it's light and a great side to almost any cuisine!

I like this better with crunchy noodles, either saute them in a little olive oil or just break up without cooking at all. The splenda is a great idea. I have used different flavors of ramen noodles and this works with all of them. Light and tasty!

I'm not a big fan of cole slaw AT ALL, but my sister-in-law made this at a barbecue and I had 3rds!  Even the kids gobbled it down!

I really loved this coleslaw. The noodles do get soft,  but I enjoyed the different textures of the crunchy cabbage and the soft noodles. I didn't have Splenda so I used a Sweet n' Low packet and just sprinkled it, stirred, and tasted until it was sweet enough for my taste. For some reason the grocery store was out of coleslaw mix so I just shredded a small head of cabbage and carrots, and I omitted the sunflower seeds because I didn't have them, but I'm sure they would have added another element of delicious crunch. I think I'll be making this on a weekly basis, we had it with stir fry but it would make a great snacking salad too! Thank you so much!

Wonderful, Toast the ramen noodles and throw in a jalapeno for spice, traded 1 T of olive oil for sesame oil, didn't use the flavoring from the ramen noodles b/c of sodium :( but really was great without.

Pretty good but I think next time I will add my own spices instead of using the seasoning packet from the noodles. I used the chicken and it gave the dish a slightly weird taste. Adding your own spices should lower the sodium level also and make the dish a little more healthy.

Yum!  I will make this again.  The green onion was a little strong for my taste, so next time I will cut back on the green onions.  I followed another reviewers advice and didn't boil the noodles, just broke them up into small pieces and added everything together.

Quick easy and no heavy dressing - great as a side or a meal! I used Chicken Ramen noodles and warmed in a pan with seeds and onions.I added diced apples (pea-size) and omitted sunflower seed. Instead I used sesame & flax for flavor and color. Serve on a bed of chow mien noodles and WOW, you got Crunch & Flavor! I couldn't wait the 2 hours- I may never get to find out if that enhances the flavor! Too good to wait.

I thought this was pretty good.  I accidentally dropped half my noodles into sink so could only use half.  It was still good, I am thinking maybe you could give it some zip with a chili pepper which I may try next time.  Would be great during the summer - awesome crunch!

Great recipe.  A couple changes: don't boil noodles, just crunch them up and add just prior to serving, toast the sunflower seeds for extra flavor, used canola oil and rice wine vinegar, fresh cilantro adds nice flavor also.

Solid recipe, but I like it better with these changes:

1)  Use slivered almonds instead of sunflower nuts

2)  Substitute 1-2 Tbs of toasted sesame oil for the olive oil (and use California olive oil, one you try it, you'll never go back to anything else)

3)  Don't cook the Ramen.  Leave it in the bag and pound it and squeeze it to break it up good, and then add it uncooked.

4)  After mixing in the "sauce", let it sit an hour or two in the fridge as directed.  But add the ramen noodles just before serving.

5)  A little more vinegar and/or a splash or two of Tabasco to give a bit more zing, if you like zing.  Or put a bottle of Tabasco on the table to let diners add their own zing as desired.

Wanted to use what I had on hand, so I shredded a small napa cabbage and added half a bag (about 6 oz) of broccoli slaw mix to the bowl.  Otherwise I  made it exactly as written. It made a light, cool, & delicious side to our seared sesame tuna steaks.  Will definitely make again - thank you! UPDATE: Had about a cup of slaw left over, so put it on a bed of torn fresh spinach with a diced cooked chicken breast for lunch today.  Try it, it's delish! :-)

I really liked this recipe, but like someone else said I think the noodles should just be broken up and not run under hot water.  They don't stay crunchy and I think it is much better with the crunchy texture.  I used one packet of stevia for the sugar substitute.

I made this slaw for a company picnic and dissapointingly ended up taking most of it home :(  I personally like the taste, but maybe others were turned off by the dish's slightly dull appearance after adding the dressing mixture.  The only exception I made was substituting slivered almonds for the sunflower seeds.  I might give this another try.

I have made this many times in the past month and LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. It is the best because it has no mayo and is very safe for outdoor gatherings. As others have stated I added one extra tablespoon of oil,vinager,and sugar. Also have added grated fresh ginger and cracked pepper very very good. Would recommend this to anyone to try even if they do not like coleslaw. Thank you for the recipe Megan

I could have eaten the entire bowl of this. I will be making this delicious, light dish weekly. My family loved it. It was easy and healthy. I might try adding different veggies to change it up, like edamame.

I have made this twice in two days.  Once for a party we went to and once for us because it was so good!  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe for the party.  The whole bowl disappeared quickly.  I made it for us using Balsamic vinegar instead of cider.  Had to sample before dinner....delicious.  The only thing I didn't do either time is boil the water for the ramen noodles.  Yesterday, after it chilled for a few hours, the crunch was gone.  However, we liked the crunch of them, so I am not allowing that long to chill.  A very tasty, lighter slaw.  Thanks!

I'm sorry to say that I didn't care for this at all. Normally I know when I'll like a recipe based on the ingredients, and this looked like a hit, but there was just something that didn't work here.  I ended up tinkering until I was mostly ok with the results, but it took quite a bit of tinkering to get it to where I'd serve it to guests.  Additionally, the color of the dressing - a sight brownish - was unappealing.

In my opinion the noodles MUST be served in this dish crunchy. Place the entire block of noodles in a cake cake pan and broil them in the oven until they are just turning brown. Note: If left in just a minute too long they can burn easily. Let them cool. Once cooled break them apart in tiny pieces and add them to the dish. Perfect!

My husband is pre-diabetic so I eliminated the ramen noodles when I made this Asian cole slaw.  Other than that, I made it as described. When I made the dressing, I thought there was no way there was enough dressing to flavor the dish but, oh my, was I wrong! This is one delicious cole slaw! I am going to save it to my favorites and make it often to go with many different lunches and dinners. Thanks for this great recipe!

I like the convenience, and the sunflower seeds are a nice touch; but the noodles got sodden and overall it's kind of bland.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used a food processor to shred my cabbage instead of using premade and used sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds.

Very good! Most of these Asian style coleslaw recipes use way too much oil. I like that only 3 tablespoons are used in this one. I followed the recipe except that I added a teaspoon of sesame oil and about 1/4 C chopped fresh cilantro to give it a real Asian flavor kick.

Pretty good.  Would make it again.  I would give it 3.5 stars.

We really enjoyed this variation from your standard broccoli slaw and coleslaw.  The only change I made was that instead of using sunflower seeds, I used slivered almonds seeing it's what I had on hand.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great receipe.  I've made a few changes: I added cranrasins ( to taste), used chicken ramen noodles raw (break them up in the bag adds crunch; I do not use the flavor package or cook the noodles); instead of apple cider vinegar I used rice wine vinegar; salt and pepper to taste; for a little more color; I add to the package of cole slaw mix some shredded purple cabbage.  They also sell a cole slaw mix with 3 diffrent cabbages, this works too.

This was so yummy! I used shrimp flavored ramen and didn't moisten the noodles at all.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

This was pretty good, but my husband didn't care for the sunflower seeds. Maybe try substituting almonds like other reviewers have said.
