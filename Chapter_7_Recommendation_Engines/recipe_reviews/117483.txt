Surely the oil was inadvertantly omitted from this recipe. Probably 1 to 1-1/2 cups based on this serving twelve. Usually one ounce sressing per serving and the recipe has a very small amt of dressing for 12 servings. Similar recipes have 1/4 cup oil per tablespoon vinegar.

The salad is excellent and the walnuts are a perfect touch. I was also hesitant about the sugar/pepper combination but was pleasantly surprised.

The dressing is TERRIBLE. It's very sour-there is too strong a proportion of vinegar to everything else. I tried rescuing it by cutting it with a little oil and adding more sugar but in the end I threw it out and we all ate the salad with no dressing. Fortunately it's a good enough salad to stand on its own but  I will be trying something else next time.

I made this salad this morning, exactly as written, for a funeral lunch.  The  walnut portion of the recipe was very good.  However, the dressing was bad -- way too sharp.  Other women working with me agreed -- one woman suggested using a bottled poppyseed dressing, which I will do next time.  I should have trusted my instincts.  The dressing tasted too strong after I made it, but I convinced myself it would blend well with the sweetness of the apples.

I really liked this salad but the dressing was a little overpowering to the taste buds.  I will try something on the sweeter side next time.

Great recipe!  I accidentally burned the walnuts... forgot to turn them every five minutes.  So for the second batch, I only left the walnuts in the oven for about 7 minutes and they turned out good.  I served it with Newman's light Raspberry and Walnut dressing.  I took this to a dinner party and the salad bowl was empty by the end.  Everyone went back for a second helping.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this before I read any of the reviews.  I thought it was a misprint since it didn't have any oil, so I did add 1 1/2 TBS oil.  My husband loved it, but he likes things very tangy.  I will add more olive oil next time.  Will definitely make again.

The combination of feta, apples and pecans is delicious. The dressing was awful. Way too tart. I think I'll try a raspberry vinaigrette next time.

A friend of mine made this salad but used a homemade sweet poppyseed dressing.  So good!  I'm pleased to find the salad part of the recipe here.  Next, I'll need to beg the dressing recipe out of her (...or maybe find it here too?!).

I have to agree with other reviewers - this vinaigrette was barely tolerable.  I added the 2 T oil, even though it wasn't in the recipe.  Still way to tangy.  I also had issues with the walnuts.  I made as directed the first time, and they burned before the 15 minutes were up. The second time I didn't bake them after cooking them in the skillet.  That worked better, but they just tasted like butter.  This was very disappointing to me, as we were having a ladies' lunch and my pregnant friend, who hosted, requested I bring a yummy salad.  Sadly, this was not it.

It's a great salad once you add some olive oil to the dressing.  Without the olive oil, the dressing is, of course, terrible. I only made enough salad for myself so I used 1 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. of the vinegar.  This is a great fall salad when all different varieties of apples are plentiful.  Thanks for sharing!

I read the reviews before starting and decided to make the dressing as stated first.  Upon tasting, I decided to add vegetable oil.  I only had iceburg lettuce so I used that instead.  I think this may have been better with a different cheese.

Very good I added 4 TBS oil to 2 TBS vinegar for the dressing. I didn't add butter and rather heated the walnuts up in a pan then added brown sugar and pepper to carmelize them.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this salad- I've made it three times this week!  scaled it down to about 6 servings, used 1 honeycrisp apple and a spring mix lettuce blend.  Per other reviews I added olive oil to the dressing using about a 3:1 oil:vinegar ratio.  I was stunned to hear my husband exclaim "this dressing is awesome" after his first bite-  he's a devoted carnivore, and salads don't typically get his seal of approval- but this one's a winner!! Thanks so much for posting!!

This was fantastic! I wanted to do something different ofr our salad with dinner. I had to use pecans instead of walnuts and used brown sugar instead of regular. I did cook the nuts in the toaster over and I left them a little too long, but they were still fabulous. I used romaine and the mixed greens (msclun mix). I did also add some red onion for just a little zing. The only thing I didn't do out of pure laziness was make the dressing. I taste tested with Raspberry Honey Vinaigrette and Lemon Poppyseed and the Lemon Poppyseed was the winner. Husband didn't have any - not his kind of salad, but that's fine I plan on eating every last bite. I had two servings if this instead of more of the main dish. Came together super easy (even easier if I pre-make the nights and store them) so I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I made this salad last night for dinner it was awesome. I had to add about an extra 1/2 tsp sugar to the dressiing and a little extra olive oil and vinegar the dijon mustard was really strong tasting. The original recipe didnot call for the olive oil but i added as another review had done and i only had red wine vinegar i am going to try this with white wine vinegar as it says to use.

Really, really good, with modifications to the dressing.  I followed one reviewer's advice and used 2 Tbsp. of vinegar and added 6 Tbsp. of olive oil.  It was less tangy than I like, so in the future I would probably do more vinegar and less oil.  I used pink lady apples, which are crisp and tart, and they paired really well with the feta and the dressing.

This is always a big hit whenever I serve it, many people ask for the recipe. I did alter it a bit, I added a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and used poppyseed dressing instead of the dressing in the recipe. Very delicious!

I loved this salad. I made a few changes. I left out the red leaf lettuce and the red apple. I used 3 tbsp of red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp of olive oil as per others suggestions. I left the minced onion out of the dressing as well. My husband found it "different" but he ended up going back for 2nds and 3rds.

This is a great salad recipe.  I was a little skeptical about the sugar-pepper combination on the walnuts and the oil-free dressing, but it was really delicious.  The only change I made was adding a little more mustard to the dressing.  My guests really liked this one!  Thanks.

I loved this! I followed another reviewer's advice and used 6 Tbsp. of olive oil and 2 Tbsp. vinegar. I also substituted a shallot for the onion. Next time, I will use 1/2 shallot, though, as it was very strong. I followed the remainder of the recipe exactly. Even my third-grader thought the dressing was awesome.

As the other reviewers said, the salad combination is wonderful.  The dressing is terrible.  I wish I would have read through the reviews before I made the dressing.  Even after I added a considerable amount of olive oil, I was left with a very strong salad dressing.  I didn't mind it, but it wasn't fit for a crowd.  Next time I'll add less white wine vinegar and mustard and add olive oil.

The salad is wonderful, but the dressing is far too strong. Don't let that discourage you. The salad really is a treat. I make for dinner parties and everyone always loves it.

This was delicious. Took it to a covered dish lunch - no leftovers! Did use a poppy seed drsg. as suggested by a reviewer (found the recipe for the drsg. here too). Will definitely make again.
