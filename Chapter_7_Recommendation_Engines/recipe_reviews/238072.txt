Great alternative to heavy Alfredo sauce.  I didn't have shallots, but used 1/4 of a chopped onion and 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I also melted 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese into the sauce. Served it over spaghetti since I didn't have fettuccine noodles.  Added more cauliflower florets, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh chopped basil and cooked chicken. Very satisfying dinner.

A hand blender made for a very creamy sauce. This is now a staple dish!

This sauce is just as good as the fattening kind! I did add an 1/8 of a cup of milk to make the texture more creamy. I also mixed the parmesan in although I didn't feel I needed to use a whole cup probably about a half cup. It only made two servings though so if you want more I recommend doubling the recipe.

Very good! I added a little bit of milk because it was thick.

A novel way to make an Alfredo sauce but it needs more flavor. I microwaved the cauliflower and puréed it in my cuisanart adding some half and half until smooth. I added some minced garlic to the shallots and chicken stock as well as sun dried tomatoes and some seasoned salt. I also sautéed some shrimp and added it after the cauliflower mixture was incorporated so as not to overcook it.

Very tasty with chicken also! I added a clove of garlic in with the onion (didn't have shallots). I also added about 1/4 cup more chicken stock while I puréed it in the food processor to smooth it out. Delicious!

Forgot the olive oil added less cheese and it was delicious!! Served with homemade fettuccine and cajun spiced grilled chicken breast.

My hand mixer did not cut it so I had to use a food processor. I'm pretty sure I added at least another 1/4 cup water and it still was nothing that would ever pour. I haven't eaten it yet- doesn't look very appetizing. It probably won't be it's all watered down. I'll probably have to add some milk. I'd like to know how the sauce in the picture came out like that when there's hardly any liquid in the directions. You'd need a ladle for that and I could still use a fork for mine. It's the consistency of THICK baby food.

Just as spaghetti squash will never be mistaken for pasta; neither will cauliflower alfredo sauce be mistaken for an actual traditional alfredo sauce but if you are interested in cutting back on carb & fat grams; give this a try. Very tasty.

This recipe is a good alternative. I'll make it again with some changes. It's defenitely a good starting point.
