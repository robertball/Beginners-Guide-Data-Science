The easiest recipe for the highest quality result I have ever made. It was like we were at a restaurant it was so good! Nice and cripsy crust with a moist and flaky inside. We did roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli as sides, but could be served with almost any side, or over buttered noodles with veggies, or so many other ways. Use your imagination!!!  Very good and will definitely be making it again! :-)

This was amazing!  Moist and delicious.  My boyfriend is not a big fish eater, and he loved it.  

I didn't have yogurt,  so I used sour cream instead.  Don't need to add salt; the parmesan cheese is salty enough.

Will definitely make this again.

SO GOOD!   Exactly as written, added garlic powder & red pepper flakes to panko bread crumbs & fresh grated Parm cheese.   Stress free fish, which is huge deal when I cook!  Thank you!

Really turned out nice.  The yogurt helped keep the fish moist and very tasty.  Added feta to the top of the fish and it was excellent.  Simple, flavorful and easy to make.

I made it as written and it was very good.  Had to broil it at the end to get it brown.

I used plain panko mixed with Greek seasoning from Missing Ingredient, and feta instead of parmesan. My son and I really liked this. The yogurt coating made the fish so tender!
