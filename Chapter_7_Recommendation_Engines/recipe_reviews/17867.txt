This is a GREAT recipe!! You need to follow direction just right in order for it to come out, but it is WONDERFULL. The "Dessert Mix" is b box of Dream Whip" powder found in the jellow isle--it has 4 packets in it.

I was so excited to make it and when I did it was like the root beer flattened and setteled on the bottom and turned to glue.  I made it for a Labor Day BBQ.  Sorry, I didn't like it.  The instant dessert topping is Dream Whip.  You'll find it with the box pie crusts.

I am thinking the instant dessert topping is the one called dream whip, it is a powder in an envelope in the baking isle in the store. I have used this before years ago with milk.  it works great.

I followed the recipe to a T, with fresh ingredients, and it turned out like a lead brick, absolutely terrible!
