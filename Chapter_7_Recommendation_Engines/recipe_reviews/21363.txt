One of the happiest finds I've come across in quite some time. Anything I could say to describe these would be trite and cliche and still, no words would suffice.  It doesn't hurt that some of my favorite foods and flavors on the planet are all in this sandwich - Alaskan King crab meat, black olives, artichokes, cheddar, tomatoes. Seriously, this one was a no brainer.  I used fresh, crusty, sourdough rolls that I buttered before heaping on the crab mixture.  Other than substituting a little friendlier Tabasco sauce for the cayenne and adding the green onion to taste, I made these exactly as the recipe directs.  And why wouldn't I? - to mess around with this recipe would be to mess around with perfection.  All of the ingredients come together to create something uniquely flavorful, uniquely delicious and, well, just plain unique, period.  Rich, creamy, "crabby," elegant, colorful, can't wait for the next bite delicious. So many colors, flavors and textures going on, this really made for one, memorable sandwich. I served this with a copy cat version of Olive Garden's Chicken and Gnocchi Soup, which made for a totally satisfying and delicious supper.  Regrettably, this recipe has not been reviewed in two years.  Folks, you've GOT to try this!

My husband absolutely loved this!  Made it on a prepared loaf of garlic bread so give it a bit more flavour (especially for us garlic lovers).  Since making it for the first time 3 weeks ago, he's had me make it 5 times.  We both prefer it with a mixture of shrimp and crab.  Fantastic easy recipe to make on a rushed evening.

Wow!  I made these for an impromptu dinner party and they made a huge hit!  I used marinated artichokes instead of the canned ones, though.  Yum!

Loved this!  Great combination of ingredients.  I used marinated artichoke hearts and used a bit of the 'juice' from them to thin the mayo a bit because I like a thinner mayo in salads like this.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  We ate it as hot sandwiches as the recipe indicates.  We also ate it cold on lettuce beds.  I used a little one morning warmed up and served over eggs.  For those of you worried about the calorie count - don't.  This makes FAR more than 4 servings.  Flavorful and versatile!

We made these sandwiches with some left over cooked shrimp (diced up) and they turned out great!

These were really quite tasty and easy to whip up for a swift dinner. I made them healthier by using half mayo and half low-fat sour cream, and adding a bit of lemon juice for some zing. I also hollowed out some of the middle of the roll I was using to save on a few calories, and I served these with a  cucumber/tomato/basil salad. Very summery!

Yummy!  I like to make recipes for the first time just like as described so I get an accurate feel for what can be change if anything.  The only thing I did differently was make it into like an open face sandwhich and we omitted the olives (not an olive fan).  It was sooo good.  Next time I might try even marinated artichokes which I think might be good in this also.

Used individual Baguettes and did not add the cayenne pepper.  Had extra mix that was used for a salad the next day. A real keeper!

I have had this recipe in my recipebox since August 2003!  I've often wanted to try this, but when it came to planning meals, I'd always over look it.  I finally gave it a shot this past weekend and it was great!  After reading the other reviews, I decided to try this with shrimp, as the author suggested, instead of the crab meat.  I sauted the cleaned, peeled and  butterflied shrimp with cajun seasoning and then cut them half. I also used red onion instead of green and used just a bit less mayo.  We also had ours on sourdough bread which was just delicious! This reminded me a lot of the artichoke bruschetta recipe on here.

Delicious! Love it! So did my girlfriend. We both ate way too much. The only improvement that I can think of is that it could be a little spicier. I think the next time I make it I'll had some jalapeno peppers.

Very disappointed. I did not care for the texture or the strong crab taste. We each ate half of a sandwich and then threw the rest away.

We really liked this! We cut the cayenne in 1/2 and it was still nice and spicy, but not overwhelming. A whole bunch of green onions? Seems like a lot. I used 2. Thanks, really enjoyed this and picky husband did too!

My husband hated this dish. He felt the texture of the crab coupled with the other ingriedients was just disgusting!! I might try using shrimp instead and  maybe the dish would recieve a more favorable result.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors.  The cayenne gives it just the right kick.  It was a big hit at my house!

Wow, so impressive! It did need some garlic powder and we added chili powder as well. Old Bay might've worked, too. It just needed some added flavor. I used sliced French bread (not my choice), which I lightly toasted first. We had plenty left over and it'll work cold with crackers, too.

This was a great recipe.  I used half crab and half shrimp.  I did dice the artichokes very finely as my hubby doesn't really care for them.

Wow! This will wake up the taste buds! I like the combo of flavors, if you're not into "spicy" I would reduce/omit cayenne.  Inspired me to think of other toppings for a hot open-face baguette sandwich!
