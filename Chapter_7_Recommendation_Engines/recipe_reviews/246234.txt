This is absolutely the best sauce I have ever made! My husband had to tell me to take it away before he ate it all. I added 1/2 tsp of old bay seasoning. Great sauce for everything from sandwiches to seafood to chicken!

I made and used this on a catfish po'boy and it is so tasty you would never imagine it is "light", compared to the original preparation.  I used a bit more horseradish but changed nothing else. This is a keeper!

This was excellent! I loved all of the tartness to it and it worked nicely on my fried catfish as it would many things.

I followed the recipe but added about a quarter cup of chili sauce.  Love the lighter version.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this twice, once as dressing for a crab louie salad, the other to go with friend green tomatoes. Itâ€™s got a great zing to it!

This is delicious!  I made it twice, but the second time had to tweak the amount of ingredients due to what I had on hand.  Don't do this, the recipe is perfect as printed.  My adult daughter loves this stuff.  I appreciate a yummy sauce that is made with primarily yogurt instead of mayonnaise.

This is a very nice sauce and we loved the spicy horseradish taste.
