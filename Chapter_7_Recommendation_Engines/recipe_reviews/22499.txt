I have tried many times to make the perfect baked beans using different recipes.  Although most recipes have similar ingredients, this one seemed seemed to worked perfect for me.  The beans were a hit at my holiday gathering.

This is a very easy dish to make. I omited the white sugar all together and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it still turned out very sweet. I increased the mustard to 1 tsp. I would of liked this recipe better if it was a little less sweet. The sweetness could be due to the brand of barbeque sauce I used. I baked this 70 minutes to make it thicker. I would make this again but adjust the amount of sugar.

I quadrupled this recipe for a girl's softball team family picnic last weekend, and there wasn't a single bean left over!  A big hit with all ages!  (I did omit half the white sugar and baked for 1-1/2 hours, stirring frequently.)

Very good flavor.  I followed some earlier reviewers advice, did not use any white sugar and substituted bacon for sausage.  I also used Bush's maple cured bacon flavored beans.  I have made them twice in a two week period and both times they received rave reviews.  I only used half the recommended meat as I thought the full amount would make the beans too salty.  Thanks for sharing.

Recipe was delicious but somewhat unclear on the directions.  I would add:  Do not drain beans.  Do not cover before baking.  I used bacon instead of sausage because the beans had sausage.  Very yummy.

I will (probably) never make baked beans from scratch again! Who needs to with this recipe?
I offered this and other dishes for my Octoberfest! Everybody wanted copies of the recipe. Of course I obliged!

This was good, but also very sweet, so I would omit the white sugar. I prepared a batch and a half of the recipe, but I did drain one of the cans of beans. The other 2 added enough liquid, besides the ketchup, bbq sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. I also substituted yellow prepared mustard for the mustard powder, and added 5 weiners, sliced (about a 1/2 a pound), after I lightly browned the sausage just a bit, then finished browning the sausage. I baked the bean mixture for exactly 50 minutes (uncovered). I will definitely make this dish again. After all, I have plenty of already seasoned ground pork sausage in the freezer to use up. This is a great side dish to serve at any potluck or famliy function. Thank you Maybelle Miller for posting this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!!

I soaked beans and boiled them rather than using canned ones, and I added sausage AND bacon to the recipie and then poured about half a cup of belgian beer over all of it and let it bake for just over the recommended time. Delicious! I'll definatly make it again.

This recipe was way too sweet for our taste.  If I were to make it again I'd probably omit the white sugar and either the ketchup or BBQ sauce.

Exactly what I was looking for...a simple and delicious canned baked beans doctored up a bit.  Used bacon instead of sausage as that is a taste preference and I omitted the white sugar as the other reviewers recommended.  Serving was perfect for the 6 guests I had over for BBQ.

These were very good. I agree with most of the other reviewers though...I think the white sugar would have just made it way too sweet (which is the only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars). I did add the 1/2 cup of brown sugar though, and I think it has just the right amount of sweetness.  I also added some fresh minced garlic and used spicy Italian sausage. I liked the combo of sweet with the heat. Thanks for the recipe...very good.

This was very easy to make (put in slowcooker for 5 hrs. on high), and it was quite good. I prefer sweet beans, that's why I chose this recipie. My dh's grandfather said over and over they were the best beans he's ever had. That's a pretty good compliment to the recipie.  I have had better, so that's why it's a 4 for me. I'd make them again. I used a pound of turkey bacon instead of sausage...that was the only hard part, cooking all that bacon.

I have been using this recipe for years and everyone loves it.  I use lite sausage to cut down on the fat and it turns out great.

I made this recipe as directed (omitting the white sugar), but there was something missing.  So I used stone ground mustard and added some Texas Pete hot sauce to them for a bite and they came out perfect.  Will definately make again!

So good. I brought this to a friend's barbecue tonight and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly except for the granulated sugar, which I left out. And I also increased the bake time to about an hour and a half. I'll make this many times before the summer's over.

These were very good but wayyyy too sweet for us. I added a couple can of plain beans to cut the sugar and that did the trick.

I didn't add the white sugar because of other reviewers and I loved this recipe.  The sausage is a must.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I did tweak it a little - left out the 1/4 C of white sugar - don't like it too sweet. And for the pork I used spicy chorizo sausage links that I chopped up as I was cooking them with the onion. Dish turned out great - husband loved it.

We add a 1/2 pound of hamburger and a pound of cooked bacon. There's never left overs! We make this for all our neighborhood grill-outs and it's now a requested dish.

Yummy! I used the mix of canned beans and  can't wait to really do this one right. And by right I mean from scratch and some mods that I know would be outstanding to my taste. Because I had all these ingredients on hand, was in a pinch for "fancier" baked bean dish, and know my way around my kitchen, I prepped this dish is 5...6 minutes! Lol- *********yes, it's only a 3 star  cuz I had to omit the majority of sugar! Just didn't see the purpose- love some of the other ides here in the ratings!!! Some of my mods- diced celery, carrots, jalapeños in with the mix, molasses vs some sugar, boost the BBQ sauce,  more variation of beans.

I used leftover pork roast and/or bacon and left out the the white sugar, it was sweet enough. It was amazing!!  I've made it twice now and it's a real hit.

this was pretty good... i substituted the mustard powder for spicey mustard.  next time i think i'll use bacon or chopped hot dogs instead of the sausage.  thanks for sharing.
