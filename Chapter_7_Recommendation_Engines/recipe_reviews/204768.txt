Very, very dry.  1st recipe that I didn't like from this website.  Not much flavor either, couldn't taste the nuts, should have used walnuts.  Don't know what else you could have done to make it moist.

Excellent!  Really moist and delicious.  Our changes: I left out the pecans and flax seeds just because I didn't have them on hand.  I did not put the blueberries in sugar or at the bottom of the pan, I just mixed them in the batter.  I also made a powdered sugar/butter/hot water and vanilla glaze and poured it on about 10 minutes after it came out of the oven.  It was a big hit!

This is fantastic. Mine came out beautifully in a 9 inch round cake pan (had to reserve nearly 1 cup of the batter as the original recipe is written for a  larger 9x5 loaf pan*). The baking time was a bit less with the smaller pan. Nice texture, not too sweet. Moist, a bit dense but not gummy like some banana breads. Omitted the flax seeds. Did not mix the pecans in the batter. I used the pecans in Streusel that I sprinkled over whipped cream I topped the bread with.

My results were great! I used coconut oil(I don't use canola) it added another flavor to the bread. I also used frozen blueberries. Just defrost them first. It does make a large loaf! But still didn't have any left after I had four friends over for coffee. Making another today so hubby and his friends can have some.
