This is not very good. Great idea, but needs a lot of help.

So fresh and light.  The perfect snack or even as a main dish.  A little too much oil for me, so I just eyeballed it and used a few drizzles.

I tried this for dinner last night and it was excellent.  I didn't use the extra olive oil/garlic, so next time I would probably cut the olive oil/garlic mixture in half.  My family enjoyed it as well and some added parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again for a quick vegetarian meal.

Great recipe. Makes a nice lunch, side, or dinner (just add some grilled chicken or fish). Used basil-infused olive oil and skipped the fresh basil. used garbanzo beans and rotini whole wheat pasta since I had them on hand. Sliced up some spanish and kalamata olives and grated fresh pecorino romano. YUM! SO ridiculously easy.

I loved this. It was so easy and delicious. The only change I made was to heat the garlic and oil for the infusing instead of just letting it sit at room temp. Also, I used tri colored penne instead of regular farfalle for a nutrition boost. Definitely recommend this dish!

It is a little plain tasting but I like it this way. I may add some jalapenos to a bowl or two just to give it some kick.
