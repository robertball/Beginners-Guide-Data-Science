Finally, a key to cooking American recipes that call for "chilli powder" I can blend this up and go from there. 
In Australia (and Asia generally) chilli powder is just 100% ground chillis. Using it in US recipes ends in disaster!

Didn't have a packet and my sister couldn't find any in the store. Apparently the threat of snow got everyone in a chili mood. Found this recipe and had everything except onion powder and my oregano is a wild Greek one that is so fragrant that I used half of what the recipe called for.  2 tablespoons of this, a little salt and veggie broth were the only seasoning the chili needed. FANTASTIC!!

It's missing the red Chile pods to be considered Red Chile powder. Added with the other herbs/spices listed it would make a good Chile powder. As is this is just a spice pack. Chili is stew like Texan made with beans and meat. Chile comes from red or green Chile peppers.

This is what I will use from now on.  I was out of the premixed stuff so i Googled "what is in chili powder" and found this.  I used it in a venison chili with smoked paprika and chipotle chili powder instead of cayenne.  It was better!

I didn’t have any chili powder nor could I find any as I ran into the closest store.  So I looked online and found this.  I must say it is very good and even has that kick too it which is great.  My grandchildren & I like a bit of a kick to our food so this is great.  We all enjoyed the chili that day & the next day...

I was really impressed at how easy and inexpensive it was to do this. One recipe was good for a 2lb ground beef base. Never buying pre-mix again.

This recipe is great! I will never buy store-bought again. I also like it because I can omit the garlic powder which upsets my stomach.

Love this recipe. I use it all the time since my daughter has an artificial food dye sensitivity and unlike pre-made mixes that may have red or yellow food dye, I know that when I use my own spices, we are covered :). I omitted the cayenne pepper and add that in for each recipe separately so I can control the spice. I now make a jar full of this seasoning ,since we love it so much, so I can just reach into my pantry and use it whenever :) !

Thank you for this recipe! Turned out great. Unable to find chile powder in EC so has saved the day. My husband likes to make chili so I made this for him.. even though has always had very high opinion of his chili before also - said he thought was even better using this chili powder :)

This is an easy, tasty recipe. When I went to make it, I realized I didn't have chili powder, so I improvised with some ancho chili powder, chipotle chili powder and a little extra cumin. It gave it a little kick, but wasn't overpowering. It reminded me of Wendy's chili with macaroni.

I needed Chili Powder at 6AM on Sunday of a long weekend to discover hubs used it all up, and didn’t write it on the list!  

You may have prevented a divorce and I might even let him have some of the ribs I made with it:)  Thank You! 
 I’m not buying premade blend again!

Thought I had a jar of ground chili (powder) but didn't, so was really happy to find this recipe. It's a great starting point and makes a few Tbs., plenty for most recipes. I saved the remaining amount in my empty chili powder container and next time will follow this recipe but will use ground chilis, smoked or un-, as an addition so that is the predominant flavor. Again, it's a great emergency stand in that made a tasty addition to my turkey chili.

Thank you for the recipe!  I'm allergic to paprika.  Used 2 tbsp. Ancho Chile powder, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Amounts of oregano, cumin and garlic powder as submitted. Omitted the onion powder.  Didn't see it listed on "chili powder" bottles in the store.  I use this for my chili, homemade mayo, catsup, mustard and any recipe that lists paprika.

10.24.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237172/chili-powder/reviews/6611621/ ... While I almost followed the recipe, I added it to a dish that called for other spices.  That leaves an iffy stance on validity, huh?  I think so, too; but, while difficult to separate it with other additions, I’m voting “good” because I’d know if it weren’t a good recipe.  I would!  :D  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't add any cayenne pepper this time. And it turned out good and I plan on making it again instead of buying chili seasoning to make chili ever again.

Pretty fair, better than most bottled brands.  I like cumin powder and add a big pinch extra.  I also add 1 tsp dutched cocoa powder.  Takes it to an entirely new dimension .

I was out of regular  paprika so I used smoked paprika. That worked fine just added a smokey flavor. Next time I will use regular paprika.

I was out of chili powder and found this recipe. Super easy and all the ingredients are always in the spice rack. We do not buy premade chili powder anymore!  Thank you

I don’t use a lot of Chili Powder or use it that often so this is the perfect fit for me.  It was delicious by the way!  I’ve also passed it on to my son!

I made a double batch following the recipe exactly.  The paprika overwhelmed the other spices- actually it was all you could smell in the chili.  Maybe it was the brand, I don’t know.  Using the second half today but will add in additional of  the other ingredients to tone it down.

I used this seasoning blend tonight in the "Blue Ribbon Chili" recipe on this site and it was absolutely phenomenal! 

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, adjusting serving size for 3 lb. ground beef, and it was not only the best chili I have made, but the best I've had! 

Thank you for sharing this blend, it is SO SOO much better than store bought! 

Try it! It does not disappoint!

This is a very nice 'base' for chili powder.  I like spicy things buy cayenne disagrees with my stomach - I didn't add any cayenne.  I made this 'some months' back and put it into a little jar with my other spices.  I used it today as a base for a fajita seasoning... yum yum yum

Because of migraines, I didn't add the onion powder.  It still is an excellent chili powder mix.  If you also are predisposed to migraines, with onion as a trigger, you can used dried scallion, shallot, or spring onion (if you are not sensitive to those).

I didn't change the recipe but did use my own dried oregano and garlic powder which I believe makes it taste more flavorful. I was happy to find this recipe thanks.

Went to the store today to buy a package of chili mix only to get home to discover the  clerk did not put it in my bag.  Decided to look up a recipe rather than go back to the store in the snow  and rain.  I came across this recipe and I am so glad I did.  This is a winner and a keeper for me..  Thanks, Terry.

I had a large packet of red chili and used this recipe. I substituted 1 Tblsp. red chili powder for the cayenne pepper. Thanks Terri.
