This is delicious!  Very nice lemon flavor.  I cut the butter down to a 1/2 Cup and increased the yogurt to 1 Cup, and it still came out moist.  I've been looking for a good lemon poppy recipe, and this does it for me!

Like other members, I also cut the butter down to half a cup and upped the yogurt to one cup.  Though I baked this in two round cake tins.  When they were cool, I spread a lemon glaze (1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, zest of one lemon, 3-4 tablespoons lemon juice and a little water) over the top of the bottom layer, put down the top layer and drizzled the remaining glaze.  Great cake with tea!

Seriously delightful recipe! I made 12 jumbo muffins, and had plenty of batter. It bakes up really light and lemony, great texture, not heavy like pound cake. Moist, sweet, delish! It's a keeper!

I put 1/2 cup of margarine as opposed to 3/4 cup, and added a whole cup of yogurt instead.  AND, it was mixed berry yogurt.  Let me tell you...they were DELICIOUS.  I will definitely be making this again.

The recipe turned out great but did not have enough lemon flavor. Since I omitted the zest because of personal preference, I added more lemon juice but obviously not enough. Instead of making 2 loaves I made 1 plus 12 muffins. I agree that there are way to many poppy seeds. Will definitely make again just fine tune it to my taste.

I tried out this recipe this morning- it took a while to prepare and put together, but 10 minutes after it was put in the oven the apartment smelled like lemon-cream. It was delicious!
Unlike many people that reviewed this recipe- I followed it to a T. I figure its better to try it, and then make adjustments that I see fit.
I DID notice that it took longer than the 50 minutes in the oven, the middle was still liquid-y when I checked it at 45min. I left it in for a bit over an hour, then was scared that the edges would be a little burnt. 
We've enjoyed a slice already since then- it was beautiful. Im just hoping it doesnt dry out too quickly- if it does, dont worry- I'll let you know!!!!

This cake wasn't burned but it was really dark when I took it out of the oven. I had made a couple of changes to the recipe (using only two eggs, losing the poppy seeds and adding more lemon zest) but I followed the cooking times and temperatures properly so I don't see how that could have made a difference.  

Anyway, to remedy this I sliced off the burnt-ish outsides, turned the cakes upside down and covered the whole thing in a glaze of lemon juice, icing sugar and a little butter. The cake soaked up the glaze so the outsides had extra sweetness, the inside was moist and tasty and the cakes smelled great. 

I saved one of the loafs in the fridge and had it a week later, it was just as good as when it was freshly cooked.

If you're thinking of making this cake, go for it! It's very tasty and light and despite the mishap I had with the burning, I enjoyed it very much.

I halved this recipe and made it into 11 muffins instead of one loaf.  They tasted so good!  I tend to stick with the popular recipes, so it was a pleasant surprise that a recipe that didn't have a zillion reviews still turned out to be so yummy and worthwhile making.  :-))

Gone in 20 minutes!  Absolutely delicious!

I made no changes to the recipe at all, but baked it as a bundt for an hour and glazed with the following:

Ingredients 

1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons corn starch

Heat lemon juice and 1/2 cup of water until simmering
Slowly add sugar, stirring until it dissolves
Separately, mix cornstarch and 1/4 cup of water until smooth
Slowly add flour/water mix to lemon juice, stirring
Cook for about 4 minutes to let glaze thicken, stirring occasionally

Let cool and pour over cake

This is good, but I wish it had more lemon flavor.  I even added some lemon extract.  But it was still good.  I used half whole wheat pasty flour and half applesauce for the oil.  I made half the batch into mini muffins (24) and my kids just ate them up- they loved them!

Delicious!! Made exactly as is but I added 3/4 tsp of lemon extract. NOTE: you need two lemons for this recipe to get the 1/2 cup and 3 tbsp of rind. And it takes 20 minutes to make the muffins

As per other reviews, I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and increased yogurt to 1 cup. I also didn't use 1/2 cup poppy seeds as I felt it would be too much. Very good and moist, will make again!

I found this to be an excellent recipe and just what I was looking for...I would like to add that some people claimed the lemon flavor was not heavy pr strong enough, adding lemon juice won't add extra flavor, the flavor is in the rind or zest.

My Husband loves this recipe. The only change I made was using sour cream instead of yogurt as that is what I had on hand. I also cut the baking time by 5 minutes as my oven tends to run hot. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This is delicious!  Perfect!  I changed the recipe a little to make it healthier: I only used 1/4 cup of butter and I used half a cup of apple sauce instead; I also used 1.5 cups self-rising flour and 1.5 cups wheat flour; 1.5 cups brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar and I used a full cup of yogurt.  I also used fresh lemon juice and rind -- not bottled lemon juice.  I found that 2 medium sized lemons provided exactly the right amount of juice AND rind.  I have no complaints about the lemon flavour -- it's just the right strength in my opinion.  I like a present but subtle lemon flavour-- not too tart or overpowering.  Baked it for 50 minutes -- it was quite dark on the outside (not burnt at all, though, just very golden), but I checked it at 40 and 45 minutes and it wasn't ready yet.   Will definitely make this one again and again!

Delicious! I used Whole Wheat instead of all-purpose flour. I also only used 1/2 (1 stick) of butter, and 1 whole cup of Vanilla yogurt. I added more lemon zest than the recipe calls for, and only a 1/4 cup of poppyseed. The bread turned out pretty moist, but I think next time I will use even less poppyseed. We didn't have any confectioners sugar to make an icing, so I used evaporated cane juice crystals (you could also just use white sugar) and flour as a substitution.  First, make a flour and sugar mixture. Place 3/4 cup into a seperate bowl with 3 T lemon juice and 1 T water. Stir well. Add more flour/sugar mixture until texture has reached desired point. =) Serve over bundt cake. HINT: Tastes even better when served still warm from the oven! =) Enjoy!

Followed suggestions and made with 1/2 cup butter, and 1 cup yogurt.  A little too much poppy seed for my taste.  Will try with 1/3 cup next time.  GREAT recipe.

Sorry, not good.  I fortunately used a little over a 1/4 c poppy seeds, 1/2 cup would have been way to many.  But that wasn't the problem...The texture and lack of raising were my problems with the recipe.  I've made it more than once, one time doing muffins AND I followed the recipe.  These were just not my thing.

These are not rated highly enough imo.  They are wonderful and moist.  Lemon-flavored baked goods are the sort of thing that are subject to personal preference. Some like just a hint of lemon and then there are those who are like me - I want so much lemon that it makes me pucker up!  So I add lemon extract and generously measure that 1/2 C of juice and zest.  Also, I add a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar to the tops of the muffins when they've cooled a bit.  My kids LOVE them.

I used lemon yogurt instead of plain, and since I hate zesting lemons and was in a hurry I used 1 T of lemon extract in with the yogurt and lemon juice.  I also added a few drops of yellow food coloring because the batter was not yellow at all, and it came out great - just like you buy at the store, but better!

Moist and lemon-y ... exactly what I was looking for!  I wanted a distinct lemon flavor, so after reading other reviews, I used the zest of 3 large lemons, along with their juice (equalling almost 1 cup of lemon juice).  I also dusted the bottom of my pans with white sugar, so that they would have a sweet crust.  My loaves were perfectly done in 40 minutes, so you might want to keep an eye on them towards the end of baking.  A fantastic recipe!  Thank you, thank you!

Really yummy, swapped a bit of butter out for more yogurt (as per recommended).  It was a bit on the dry side, but still good.  I poured a lemon juice + powdered sugar glaze over the top after the bake for added sweetness.

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I used 1/2 c. butter, 1 c. yogurt & quite a bit of extra lemon zest.  The result was a very crumbly, overly sweet muffin with barely a hint of lemon.  Having already promised to take these to a gathering, I had no choice but to try to quickly improve them, so I mixed some lemon liqueur with powdered sugar to make a glaze, hoping it'd improve the flavor (or would at least make the tasters tipsy enough not to notice the crumbly texture).  The glaze helped a bit, but I will not be using this recipe again.

This is a nice lemony cake, great fresh out of the oven or even two weeks later! I was looking for a lemon poppy seed loaf recipe after getting a free sample at William Sonoma. I thought for sure I could find a recipe as good as theirs and make my own for much cheaper. This is the recipe! It was very simple to make and turned out well. I added more lemon zest because I like it. Way to go Irene, this recipe is a winner!!

I baked this loaf because I needed to use my egg yolks that were left over from an egg white recipe. I halved the recipe and put 2 egg yolks instead of 1.5 eggs. The loaf didn't rise as much as shown in some of the pictures but it still came out delicious!

Made this for a Friday afternoon meet &greet. Everyone loved it. Did take the recommendations of previous bakers to reduce butter and increase yogourt. It was a hit especially my husband who loves lemon poppy seed muffins.

Followed others advice and upped the yogurt to one cup and decreased butter to one stick. I wanted a smidge more lemon flavor, so added 1 tsp of lemon extract. It never hangs around more than 2 days! Delicious!

***Edit - I have decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and still find it plenty sweet enough, for those of us watching our sugar intake!

We made this today and it was delicious. Followed the recommendations of other reviewers regarding the butter (1/2 c) and yogurt (1 c), and also cut the poppy seed down to 1/4 c based on other recipies I'd seen. Topped with a lemon juice + powdered sugar glaze, and it was a hit.

Unlike most of the other reviewers, I followed this recipe exactly. It took slightly more than 50 minutes to bake, closer to one hour. 

The texture was very moist, very lovely, however there were way too many poppy seeds! Very little lemon flavour, next time I will double the zest and see if that helps!

Not sure why this recipe has only four stars because it is so darned good.  I will admit though that this is much better as two loaves than it is as a bundt.

Very little lemon flavor, odd texture, and the batter fell. Threw the whole thing out and bought a lemon loaf at the grocery.

This loaf has real flavour and was easy enough to make. However, we found the texture to be quite dry. This may be down to differences between yoghurt in America and Britain (our yoghurt tends to be thicker and richer here in the UK), or something about the recipe itself. If I made again, I'd be tempted to try the recommended alteration of increasing the yoghurt and decreasing the butter, just to see if that helps. Overall, though, lovely flavour, nice crisp texture on the outside, and I love poppy seeds, so definitely not too many for me!

I was so excited about this recipe, I did all as required and baked for 50 minutes but it wasnt ready. I baked even more - for 1 hour in total, the sides are brown but inside seems too raw and sticky, also it tastes really dry and too sour. I also put only 30 gr of poppy seeds but it still seems too much. I wont make it again.

I tried several recipes and this is the best. Thanks IRENED! I was looking for a lemon loaf recipe that did not require extracts (almond, lemon, vanilla, etc) but simply lemon rind and juice, and I found it here. I did not change any ingredient or amount. My only change/suggestion is that if you want a lighter/fluffier loaf you should separate eggs - the yolks are added to the sugar/butter batter and the whites are whipped (to add air to the mix) and folded in just to incorporate at the end (when everything is already mixed)(do not overmix after you add the whites, otherwise this procedure has no purpose).

4 stars with the recommendations for the yogurt and butter. I did swap out the butter for unsweetened applesauce. Even though I used  lemon flavored yogurt, the lemon flavor was too subtle. I added 1 tsp of lemon extract. The DH gave it two thumbs up.

I wanted to change this recipe to be a little less caloricly dense and get a bit more fiber. I subbed in splenda for the two cups of sugar, fat free plain yogurt Instead of regular, and did half and half all purpose flour and whole wheat flour. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of  butter. I like an extra lemon kick also so I added a teaspoon of lemon extract along with the recommended amount of juice. I also cut back the poppy seeds to 1/2 cup. I also cooked it in a decorative bunt pan for kicks. Everything turned out great. Of course it will not taste exactly like the original recipe, but it is a good start to a more spot one low-cal replication. My friends and family enjoyed it. Next time I will try a bit more lemon extract and probably a half a cup less splenda.

Really good.  As another reviewer had said it wasn't lemony enough, I chose to make it with lemon yoghurt.  I took it to a softball tournament my teenage daughter was in and the whole team loved it.

I halved the recipe to make one 9.x5" tin (tins what we call them in the UK) - I found the cake a little small actually - but that aside it was a lovely recipe - will def make again. Followed ingredient quantities to a T. A tad sweet for me, but others said it wasn't too sweet. I think the yoghurt is key for the moistness. I might try it with 50g less sugar next time....all that said. Very nice though.

Excellent. I follwed the recipe exactly except that I added a little lemon extract just to make sure it was lemony enough. Tasty and moist. One loaf stayed home and disappeared, one came to the office and disappeared just as quickly!

Pretty good.  Nice and light cake but not enough lemon for me.  Will make again but increase lemon and decrease the sugar as well and probably heed the advice of others and halve the butter and double the yogurt.

I made it exactly as written and found it to have too many poppy seeds. It tasted more like poppy seed cake with a hint of lemon other than the other way around.

I doubled this recipe while following the advice from other reviews- cutting back the butter by 1/4 cup and adding a 1/4 yogurt. We used vanilla yogurt and since its already so sweet in itself.. also left out a cup of sugar. We also didn't use all the poppy seeds recommended.. in a doubled recipe where I should have used 1 cup I only used 3/4 and I still feel like that might be a bit much. I baked them for 14 minutes

Pretty good and lemony! I made them into mini muffins and baked for about 15-20 min.  You have to check them constantly though so they don't get dried out.  Got many compliments on them.

It was good, however, I think the recipe calls for too many poppy seeds.  I think 1/2 cup should be cut down to 1/3 or 1/4 cup.  Other than that, I liked it.

5 stars for this lovely loaf. Tasty, moist and just lemony enough for my tastes. I did change the poppy seeds to only a couple of tsp because my kids aren't too fond of them and I used lemon yogurt on the second batch as I ran out of plain. Still, excellent either way.

Nice flavour and good when fresh out of the oven, but left for even a few hours and it was really heavy.

Very good. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, 6 egg whites, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour, greek yogurt, fresh lemons and 1/4 cup poppy seeds (1/2 would have been too much, I think). Next time I will add a little more applesauce to make it more moist but it was delicious regardless. Thank you for this recipe!

I didn't realize how many lemons you would need for this recipe, I only ended up using the zest from one lemon, and it turned out fantastic!

Soooooooooo good!  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used a bundt pan and increased baking time by about 40 minutes.  I made a lemon juice drizzle to go on each slice as it is served.  Just the right amount of lemon flavour and poppy seeds.  Definitely will be making this again!

Not very good, crumbly and not flavourful at all.  Had too pretty much re-create the recipe the second time.  Not making it again!

Great basic recipe. I made muffins and topped with lemon glaze (lemon juice & confectioners sugar). My muffins fell, though, and I'm not sure why. Yes, they were baked all the way through.

This was quite lemony and tasty, but I think it would have been too dry if I had not taken another reviewers advice and added a lemon glaze to it.

I  decreased the butter and increased the yogurt (used fat free, which wasn't a problem).  I also used a lemon glaze.  I omitted the poppy seeds out of personal preference.  It was moist and flavorful, but just not lemony enough for me.  Maybe I need to use more lemon juice and zest next time.  If there was just some way to get the glaze IN and THROUGHOUT the bread.  The kids liked it!

MMMMmmmmmmm so good. I just finished making these and I made them as muffins and baked for 20 min. they were done perfect. The only changes I made were to reduce the poppyseeds to 1/4 cup as per other reviews and that was plenty also added 1 tsp. lemon extract. Also I made the vanilla glaze recipe and topped it with that. Delish

Very tasty! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and substituted 1/2 the butter with strawberry yogurt like another reviewer did, and it came out perfect! Too many poppy seeds for me though, and I agree with the subtle lemon flavor that another reviewer said, but still very tasty!

Everyone loved this cake (I baked it in a bundt pan). After reading some reviews, I too used 1c yoghurt and 1/2c butter. I reduced the poppy seeds down to 40g, and thought that was a perfect amount. Next time I'm going to add a bit more lemon zest

Very good, I used more lemon zest and added a tablespoon of lemon juise, think I will add more next time as I thought it could be more "lemony". My boys loved it!

This was great.  Next time I will add more zest for more of a lemon flavour.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter and upped the yogurt to 1 cup.  I think this would be really great with a lemon glaze on top as well.

I made these with whole wheat flour and sucanat (organic brown sugar) and made them into mini muffins and baked for 12-15 min.  I only bought 1 lemon and found to get 3 tbsp of lemon zest you need at least 2 lemons.  Had pretty good flavor but I think with the lemon zest from another lemon it would be even better.  I also only used about 1/4 cup of poppy seeds, 1/2 cup would have been too much. Also used 1 cup of yogurt and only 1/2 cup butter as other reviewers suggested.

I cut this recipe in half and it made 11 muffins.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter (reduced amount as other reviewers did) and upped the amount of yogurt (also like other reviewers).  The taste is lovely and my picky three year olds loved them.  I will make again.

This is a really great recipe, I will definitely make it again! The yogurt was a nice touch. I added a little more yogurt, more lemon juice, and less poppyseeds per the other suggestions. Also used half wheat flour and half white flour and still turned out well. Would be great with a glaze on top. Kudos :)

This was fantastic!  I made one loaf and twelve muffin/cupcakes using the suggestions offered in previous reviews, (ie. 1/2 cup of butter and 1 full cup of lemon yogurt, less than a 1/4 cup of poppy seeds, and the glaze suggested).  The cupcakes went to everyone at work and they LOVED them, I've even had several people ask for the recipe.  

This one is going in my recipe box!

Excellent loaf.  Followed recipe exactly but subsituted yogurt for low-fat sour cream.  I used 1/4 cup of poppy seeds but could have even used slightly less. 
Cake came out light and fluffy - Half way through baking I placed foil over loaves to prevent over browning.  Highly recommend trying this cake!

This is a wonderful recipe! A perfect compliment to a cup of coffee or hot tea. I used lemon flavored yogurt instead of plain and it had just the right amount of lemon flavor.

I like the suggestion to cut the butter and add more yogurt - will try next time.  I made the mistake of making less than half the recipe, and it was too small.  Nice flavor though.  I think next time I'll add more lemon juice and zest.

Very moist and was a huge hit at church coffee hour.  I added and extra 1 tsp. of lemon extract, but it still wasn't lemony enough for my taste buds.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. I made 24 mini muffins with this recipe by dividing it by 3. Instead of butter I used half margarine and half applesauce. Instead of measuring the lemon juice and zest, I zested one lemon and used all of its juice. Instead of yogurt I used light sour cream. I used 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds. I used the Pampered Chef Mini-Muffin pan so I decreased the oven temp to 325 and baked for 25-30 minutes. The tops of the muffins came out light while edges that were touching the pan came out dark.

I made this and used non fat butter spead in place of the butter and non fat lemon yogurt too.
It was very good and not even 1 gram of fat per piece.
It needs more lemon juice.

I give it 3.5 stars.  Quick and easy. Light.  Reduced poppy seeds and increased lemon zest based upon reading other reviews.  I should have added even more zest!  I cut recipe in half, made just one loaf...that worked well.  Overall, it could have been a bit more moist for my taste, but pretty good.

Maybe it was my baking soda, but this didn't rise like I had hoped.  Also, Verrrry poppy-seedy, which might have accounted for the heaviness.  I added a lemon glaze, as I agreed with a previous reviewer that it could have had a more lemony flavor.

I've made this delicious meal loaf twice. It's AWESOME! Very moist. I did grate and add cheese too. Love the ketchup/mustard/brown sugar glaze, that adds some zing! Delish!

I made this recipe exactly as written. It’s definitely light on lemon flavour but it’s still quite delicious. 50 minutes of cooking time was far too long. I set it for 45 minutes and it was well done by that point. It sunk in the middle too so it didn’t look pretty.

Excellent recipe. I did go with other reviewer suggestions and reduced the butter while increasing the yoghurt. 
I did not add as much of the lemon rind as mentioned (only had two lemons) and it still turned out to a great cake. Baked in a bundt pan.
Thank you for the recipe.

The loaf is delicious and turned out so fluffy! The recipe is very forgiving. You can change it a lot and it will still turn out amazing. I halved the recipe to make one loaf and I added 2 eggs instead of 1 1/2. I only had bread flour so that is what I used. The loaf turned out great. Amazing recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I reduced the poppy seeds  by half. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the nickel. This loaf is nice and lemony without being overpowering and creates a great crust.

Made it twice so far.  Beautiful taste.  My husband and daughter don't like yogurt so I substituted sour cream and used half the amount of poppyseed.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Moist and delicious.  Next time I may take the suggestion of several reviewers and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.

This is a great recipe! I decided to use 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup yogurt, and it was still moist and delicious. However, I used two round 8-inch pans (they're only about 2 inches tall) and it almost burned, but I turned the temperature down to 325 and it turned out good. If you're using shorter pans like I did, I recommend using a lower temperature.

This was very good and I did muffins instead of a loaf. It took 28 minutes at 350F for the muffins. I halved the poppy seeds so only put in 1/4 cup which to me was enough. I will make again!

I cut the recipe in half to make only one loaf, increased to 1/2 cup lemon juice, and cut down 2 tablespoons of butter and replaced it with a few extra tablespoons of yogurt. Came out great! Using the same recipe to make muffins next time.

I creamed the butter and sugars really well, and then added 1 tsp of lemon extract, and a couple drops of yellow food color. With the addition of a little bit of lemon extract on top of the lemon juice and zest, flavor was great. very moist.  24 mini muffins and 1 loaf out of this. Chia seeds used instead of poppy.

Cut butter to 1/2 cup and increased yogurt to 1 cup. I only had Greek yogurt so the batter was more a scoop than a pour. I used a bundt pan and made lemon syrup which I brushed on when top was cool.  The consistency was like pound cake. We loved it but I will repeat with regular yogurt simply out of curiosity.  I would recommend this recipe for sure.

Made exactly as recipe stated except I only had half the poppy seeds on hand. Still turned out great. I took it to church pot luck and it was all gone in no time. Nice lemony flavour. Other recipes are often not lemony enough. I will definitely make this again.

I used mayo instead of eggs, and made them into mini-muffins - which may be why they tended to sink a little after cooling. But the taste was fantastic, especially with lemon glaze. 27/3/17: made with eggs, following instructions exactly for alternating flour and yogurt/ lemon juice. So fluffy!!

Nice, natural fresh lemon taste. .. not too overpowering.  Moist cake bread. I will make again. 

suggestions: do not  use 1/2 cup poppy seeds! Must be a typo. I used 3 tablespoons and it was plenty. half that would have been ok too.

I cut out 1/2 cup sugar. Next time i may try substituting unsweetened apple sauce for part of the butter. 

1/2 cup lemon juice and 3T zest is about the juice and rind of 3 lemons (my lemons were small so a added just a bit of bottled juice to make up the difference)

I used plain greek yogurt because that was what I had on hand.

DO NOT OVERMIX.  After you finish beating in the last egg and you mix the dry ingredients, Mix with a spatula or wooden spoon (not a mixer) just until it is all moistened

I got 1 loaf and 7 muffins from the batter. check the muffins about 15-20 minutes. They will bake much faster than the loaf.

Took around 20 minutes longer then suggested to cook. Most likely my ovens fault. Would defiantly recommend checking with a toothpick or knife if cooked all the way through at suggested time.

It didn't rise enough, it was dry, and you could barely taste the lemon.

The cake was extremely dense and the yogurt made it smell vile, like yeast. The lemon was not strong at all, and it was not moist. There were way too many poppy seeds.

I totally health-washed this recipe and it still came out fantastically light & fluffy (as muffins). Used 3 c. WW flour + oat bran, cut salt to 1/2 t., cut sugar to 1/4 c. agave syrup+3/4 c. white sugar, cut butter to 2 T.+3/4 c. applesauce, left out lemon zest, subbed chia seeds for poppy seeds. So yeah very diff recipe but the base worked beautifully. Muffins were light 'n fluffy and very moist. 350 deg for 20 mins.

Very tasty but a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I do this recipe, I will cut the sugar to 1 cup only.

Just made this recipe. I, too used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup yogurt. I used all the poppy seed called for and did not find it overwhelming. I did find 50 minutes way too long to bake at my elevation. I only baked 40 minutes and it was just a bit dry but very tasty.  I will definintely use this recipe again.

Light and fluffy and delicious.  I thickened up the icing slightly so it wasn't as runny.  A popular choice!

Made into mini loaves. When one of them came out of the oven, I poked holes in it and poured over some Limoncello. As is, the loaves did not have enough lemon punch for me. Good, but not what I wanted. Better when soaked with the Limoncello. ;)

I just baked this today.  It is SO good.  I substituted mixed berry yogurt for the plain and only baked for 42 minutes, but those are the only changes.  I am not a huge lemon fan, so this bread was perfect for me.  Not too tangy.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  Yum.

If you are looking for a poppy seed bread recipe that is more like "bread", not cake, this is it.  I use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda and I add a 1/4 cup of lemon yogurt to the plain yogurt, decrease baking time to 40 minutes.

As a bread it was a sad failure...and I dont think I did anything wrong...but I also put it into tiny muffin tins to make mini muffins, and except for not greasing the pan enough (it has to be heavily greased) they turned out fine. I think I'll make them again. (And the batter is soooooo good....it almost didnt make it to the tin....)

The recipe gets 5 stars for taste but 4 stars for apperance.  I doubled the recipe and made 4 loaves.  The loaves didn't rise much and they sunk in the middle slightly.  It may have been my mixing technique so I'll give them a try again another time.

Super lemon poppy loaf...and I have tried a few.  Lemon flavor was just right and it went very well with the Microwave Lemon Curd (recipe from Allrecipe.com).  Highly recommend it...no changes needed.

I ususally avoid recipes that involve creaming butter and sugar together, as too time consuming. But this one really wasn't. Once you've done the creaming the rest of the recipe is very quick and easy. The loaves didn't rise as much as I thought it would but it was delicious. A delicate lemon flavour, and lots of poppy seeds.
