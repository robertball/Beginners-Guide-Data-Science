I made this into chocolate-marshmallow crescents by adding three mini marshmallows into the middle of the crescents over the mini chocolate chips. The boys inhaled them. Big hit.

We make these all the time... didn't know there was an "official" recipe.  Try adding some strawberry cream cheese to the inside, it kicks it up a bit!!!

This was so easy and yet so delicious!  It's a perfect little snack that's great for chocolate cravings.  Ya just gotta love it when two simple ingredients come together to create something so tasty. Plus you can easily "fancy" this up a bit and add a little cream cheese to the middle or drizzle with white chocolate and garnish with strawberries or raspberries - I swear you can put anything in a crescent roll and it'll taste good....

My daughter introduced me to these a couple of years ago, but her version is made with a dollop of Nutella inside instead of the chocolate chips. They are sooooo yummy!!!!

I made half my batch with nutela and the other half with semi sweet chocolate chips.  Nutela was wayyy better, not just for flavor but also a better compliment to the savory dough.

Not just for the holidays!
I brush a little melted butter on the inside to hold the chips, then brush butter on the outside and sprinkle with coarse sugar.

A variation my kids made for after school treats was to brush with butter and spread with cinnamon sugar and bake. Yummy!

VERY easy and perfect as a kiddos project.  Be sure to have extra chips on hand if you do let the kids do it because some of the chips will be eaten!  I've also used chocolate baking batons (I get mine from King Arthur Flour) instead of chips.  And once they are baked and cooled on a rack, I drizzle with a confectioner's sugar icing. Mixing in a touch of Kahlua in the icing makes it a super "adult" version that's perfect with a cup of coffee in front of the fire on Christmas eve.

Yum, yum, yum!  These are so easy to get together and decadent!   I mixed some softened cream cheese with a little powdered sugar and spread a thin layer on the crescent triangle.  I then added the chocolate chips and slightly pressed into the cream cheese.  I rolled from the big end and made sure the open ends were facing up once rolled.  This recipe is so versatile!  You could fill with just about anything.  I think some nutella and chopped hazelnuts would be amazing!  Give these a try!

I had 2 tubes of crescent rolls I needed to use up so I tried different fillings. Some just chocolate chips,to plain. Mixed some cream cheese and Polaner seedless Strawberry all fruit, very good, even the grandkids liked that one. Tried cream cheese with some mini chocolate chips, just ok. Mixed some granulated sugar and cinnamon together, these were the best ones. Grandkids want me to get more crescents so I can make the sugar/cinnamon ones again. Sprinkled granulated sugar on top of all of them as soon as they came out of the oven. What an easy and quick snack.

My daughter asked me to make this recipe TWICE!  They didn't last long in my house.  I changed up the recipe a little bit by adding some chopped pecans (pressed into the dough) and topped it with a small sprinkle of sea salt.  Delicious!

Beyond simple, and it's great that Pilsbury Crescent dough is vegan so you can use it to make all sorts of quick appetizers and desserts and still keep it vegan!

My little sister needed something "French" for her high school French class, and she suggested chocolate stuffed crescents. Not wanting to make these from scratch, I made this recipe and her whole class gobbled them up! She said they were a huge hit, and they were really easy to make.

After tasting these, my kids asked me why I didn't make two batches!  I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, so I used Jif(R) brand Mocha Cappuccino flavored hazelnut spread instead.  We'll definitely have these again soon and I can't wait to experiment with different add-ins like marshmallows, raspberry or strawberry preserves, or maybe even some sliced bananas.

So easy and great to have on hand for a last minute dessert. I added a little peanut butter. I thought the cresent rolls were a little too savory, would like to try maybe croissants next time.

I like the concept of these treats. I recommend using a high quality milk chocolate chip in this recipe. I decided to get out my Guittard Milk Chocolate chips and I paired that with creamy honey roasted peanut butter - adding a small dollop of the peanut butter to the unbaked dough, placed chocolate chips on top and gave it a light sprinkle of cinnamon before rolling it up to bake. I found that mine lightly browned by 10 minutes. Make sure you keep an eye on these as you don't want them to get too browned!

I had to write this right after  they came out of the oven. They are fantastic!!!!!!! I used 
powdered sugar and that added a nice touch but not really necessary. I have had chocolate crossiants cravings from Starbucks crossiants and these are just as good! I will be making theses again and again!

Fabulous. I followed just as directed and they were perfect. The powdered sugar is listed "if desired", but I probably wouldn't even bother making them if I didn't have any: just that simple touch makes them so much more amazing. I have also made simple powdered sugar glazes (flavorings like juice or extracts or liquers, and then enough water to drizzling consistancy) with outstanding results. Thanks so much for submitting!

These are awesome and so easy I cant believe I never thought to do this before. I also stuffed the crescents with finely chopped walnuts. For a glaze, I melted cinnamon sugar butter and drizzled it over them. You can also just brush with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. My husband is requesting these every weekend now!

I would have never thought to put chocolate chips in a cresent roll. These were delicious!! The only extra thing I did was sprinkle some brown sugar on top at the suggestion of another reviewer. I am definitely going to make these again, but I am going to experiement with different fillings and flavors.

These were better than expected.  I spread cream cheese sweetened with powdered sugar before sprinkling the chips.  Super easy to make.  Make sure you have a glass of milk to go with!

I love chocolate, almost as much as my husband, but even he couldn't finish one of these.  Thankfully I only did half with chocolate chips and the other half with cinnamon/sugar.  The cinnamon/sugar version was great!  Maybe a little glaze over the top and you got a quick decent cinnamon roll.  The recipe worked just fine for the chocolate, I guess that's just not a flavor combo we cared for.  Great idea though!

These were ok, but not my fave. I felt that they were lacking flavor, but w/ some additions, like maybe jam or cream cheese, I think these could be something special. Thanks for sharing. :)

I had a Hershey chocolate bar on hand so that is what I used. Other then that I followed this easy tasty recipe as written. They are best served warm but you won't turn them down cold.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were good. If making them again, I would brush them with an egg wash before baking and sprinkle with coarse sugar.

Awesome,  easy and fun (esp. with a child to help).  Also try with cinammon chips (no chocolate-just the cinammon).  Brush the dough w/ a little melted butter, generously place cinammon chips, roll up,  cook and eat.  All around goodness!

10-11-2017 I made these into witches’ hats for Halloween. 10-12-2012 Oh my! This is bad! No, no, no, I mean this recipe is delicious! What's bad is that I can have a chocolate fix so quickly and easily! I sprinkled a few with confectioner's sugar and topped the rest with chocolate striping and chopped pecans. Now I have to make myself not eat every single one!

These are fabulous! I mixed up a lightly sweetened mascarpone cheese and added a dollop to each crescent along with the mini chocolate chips. They are dangerous! Incredibly fast easy with such an elegant result.

great for milk free diets! (be sure to use milk free chocolate chips).  It tastes great as is, but I have a sweet tooth and loved it with a marshmallow added in the middle.  I especially loved this because I have a milk allergy, and the crescents are milk free!  I have been dying for a good chocolate chip recipe, and this one tasted a whole lot like a cookie to me...  :)

I had no idea this was an official recipe, last winter this was my go to snack when I wanted something warm on a chilly day, we get the crescent rolls from Aldi's and for me it depended on the day. I filled some with chocolate chips if we had them and most with nutella spread on ALL of it so it layered when rolled. But still DELICIOUS make it! If you like chocolate and like pastries you CAN'T go wrong! Even my mother's friends liked it and when they come over for coffee I make this or cinnamon rolls.

These were really easy to make and tasty! My chocolate chips didn't melt down all of the way and I didn't want to risk burning the crescent rolls by leaving it in longer. Next time I'll be trying them with Nutella. Definitely something to keep up my sleeve when I'm craving sweets!

Such easy delectable treats.  Perfect when you are in need of that chocolate fix.  I'm going to try this recipe with all sorts of fillings.  I did tweak a litle, I used a small amount of Hershey's frosting to the inside of the dough, added regualar chocolate chips and then rolled.  I brushed the outside with a small amount of melted butter and finished with a sprinkling of brown sugar. (forgot to mention I also used Pillsbury Big and buttery Crescent rolls, which were perfect for this recipe)

Yummy! These were easy and tasty. I made them for a quick and special Sunday morning treat. I did some with just the mini choco chips, some with chocolate and white chocolate, and some with chocolate and butterscotch. There was much debate over which one was the best. I think I would really have loved these with dark chocolate in them.

I realized too late that I was out of chocolate chips so I use chocolate toffee bits.  The kids liked them but I really prefer puff pastry to crescent rolls.  This are fast and easy though.

My daughter loved this. My husband thought it was "gross" and that you would need the taste buds of a child to enjoy them. He said he was confused by the chocolate and the crescent.. that you can enjoy each, but not together. I personally didn't think they were too bad.  I made them using milk chocolate chips and made some using heath baking bits. I liked the heath a little better than the chocolate. This would be a really interesting recipe to make for company, meetings, luncheons.

Wanted to do these a little differently, so I spread a thin layer of chocolate cream cheese on the crescent, then used peanut-butter milk chocolate chips, baked, and then topped with sauteed bananas, sliced toasted almonds, and homemade caramel sauce.  Absolutely delicious (and decadent).

These are so easy and yummy! They are versatile too. I added some raspberry jam to some and others I added the jam and cream cheese with the chocolate chips!  So delish. Thanks, Pillsbury!

Very easy, quick, pretty and yummy. I do think they need a little more than just chocolate chips to make them excellent but this is a really good starting point. I drizzled some chocolate ganache on top and also sprinkled them with chopped pecans. They were gone in no time.

So yummy!! So easy!! A great recipe to have in your back pocket.  These packages of deliciousness would be a great pastry to add to any brunch menu, but versatile enough to be the perfect evening snack complimented to a cup of hot tea/coffee or glass of cold milk.  I followed the recipe as is - since it was my first try at this recipe!  I loved them!  I will definitely be making these again - and I have ideas for variations in fillings!

Yummy.  Couldn't have been better or easier.  I made 3 different versions.  I wanted to be able to rate the original recipe, so I made some that way (only I didn't have mini chocolate chips, so I chopped some regular), I also read some of the reviews that suggested cream cheese, which sounded yummy, so I added 3 oz. cream cheese to about 1/2 of the chocolate chips.  I used half of that on 2 crescents, then added a handful of chopped walnuts to the final 2 crescents.  All 3 versions were yummy.  What a versitale recipe!

For a Christmas treat I combined both Nutella and a sprinkling of mini raspberry-chocolate chips.  Both hubby and teen son loved them.  A new tradition.  I hope they are as good 2 days from now (Christmas Day).

I make these with the funsize Milkyways. Wrap the crescent all the way around the milkyway so the chocolate does not ooze out. Brush with a little butter. (I use spray butter) top with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Yum

I used the Grands Crescent rolls with pieces of chocolate from a big candy bar. Put 2 pieces of dough together, put 2 pieces of chocolate on the dough, about 1/2" apart. Took one end of dough folded over chocolate. Did the same other side .Looks like a hot pocket.  Baked 350 oven for about 13 minutes.  While still warm, I put chocolate cream cookie spread on top. Chocolate pieces melted just right. EAT WARM!

I made this for Christmas Eve, but I added Nutella before sprinkling on the mini chocolate chips. It was a hit at our gathering!

These tasted every bit as good as those bought at a nearby coffee shop.  I think, though, they are much better, brushed with a simple glaze.   The powdered sugar alone didn't add much.

These are AWESOME!!!! Made these tonight. We didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, so I smashed an Easter bunny with a hammer and it worked just as well. I also egg washed them with a little vanilla dripped in it, and topped them off with drizzled chocolate when they were done. Absolutely fabulous

Oh my gosh - these are wonderful! I did use dark chocolate and sprinkled with powdered sugar when out of the oven.  I will definitely try some of the other filling suggestions for my non-chocolate eating family members.

I made these using Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips and some left over Carnation Dulce De Luche Caramel. I omitted the powdered sugar. First, spread a thin layer of the caramel on the crescent triangle and top with the chips across the lower half. Roll. Bake on parchment paper (because the caramel may ooze out a little). 
Very tasty!!

I have never made this exact recipe but I often do something very similar. I have found that a square or two of a Hershey's chocolate bar (I prefer dark) melts better than chocolate chips, so I usually use that. Chocolate chips will work fine though if you do not have a chocolate bar. I also brush the top of the crescents with egg wash and sprinkle them with granulated sugar prior to baking them. They always come out great!

I just finished making these and i LOVE them. I had no mini chips so i used full size ones. the only thing i think is needed it metlted butter to hold the chips on. i tried just placing them on a few and when i went to roll them, they fell off. so i melted some butter and brushed it on before placing the chips

Really great & insanely easy. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so one of these with a couple of fresh berries made a perfect light dessert.

I found this recipe in a Hershey's cookbook when I was a kid.  My Mom and I made these together using regular size milk chocolate chips instead of mini chips.  Before we put the chips on the croissant, we sprinkled cinnamon and sugar, then put the chips, then rolled it up.  Since then, I have been hooked--and now make them for my husband who loves them.  Did I mention that eating one straight out the oven with the chocolate warm and melting and a glass of cold milk is just heavenly?  ENJOY!
