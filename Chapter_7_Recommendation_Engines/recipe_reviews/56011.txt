I found it really easy to make but i have tweeked the recipe a little i added 1 1/4 cups pumpkin   2 8oz packages of the cream cheese and i put cinnamon and added cloves a bit of nutmeg too taste i never really measured,I also found if you need this pie make it the night before because its not really set after 3hours it takes much longer i cooled it out of the fridge for about 2hours so i could touch the bottom of the pan then i put it in the fridge for another 2hours before i covered it because i found it would condensate and be a little mushy longer.SoI have now made about 10 or more of this pie and cant keep it in fridge more then 2 days its always gone my hubby takes it to work and all the guys fight him for it,Also i did not always use graham crust i also used shortbread,and gingersnap they were all good. thanks 4 the easy recipe that is yummy....

I made this Fluffy Pumpkin Cheesecake for our Thanksgiving dinner, and it was the first pie to go!! Everyone loved it. I did make one change to the recipe, I used non-fat cream cheese and no one noticed!! It was delicious and nearly guilt free!

This was very moist and creamy. Definately take the time to make fresh pumpkin as I did. Use the small sugar pumpkins, not the carving pumpkins. You can do it in the microwave for about seven min/pound. Also making it the day before and chilling it for 24hours, is the best way to get the proper set and to let the spices and flavours develope IMHO. Nice with just a dollop of whipped cream or cool whip. MMMM MMMMM

This was an easy recipe, but it tasted pasty. Not as good a traditional pumpkin pie and definately not as good as a cheesecake.  It took much longer to bake.  If you use light cream cheese you need to add a little corn starch to help it set up like regular cream cheese (light cream cheese is more watery)  I won't make again and my family doesn't blame me.

This was excellent. I made it for Thankgiving. I chose it because it looked the easiest. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. The great thing about this recipe compared to other Pumpkin Cheesecakes was that it was quick and easy......and yummy!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and had many ooh's and ah's over it, it was very popular.  I will be making it again this year.  Looks pretty decorated with chocolate and white chocolate leaves.

I don't like plain old pumpkin pie so this recipe is exactly what I was looking for! It looks easy and has only a few ingredients, including ready-made crusts. I haven't made it yet but this recipe is all I need. (I'll rate again when I have gotten "rave reviews" on this recipe!)
