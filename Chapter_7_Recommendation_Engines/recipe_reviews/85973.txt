The recipe is wonderful!  I wasn't brave enough to try 3 bulbs of garlic, but 2 did it really nicely for my guests.  (Thanks IMP70 - I guess I was expecting the liquid to be in the list of ingredients, not in the body of instructions.)

I only used one bulb instead of 3 and it was delicious.  The garlic really makes the dish.

This was not nearly as spicy as I had hoped.  Next time I would use much more hot pepper sauce and garlic

It's very easy and good, but doesn't look like the picture! Unless you really brown the beef, but because of the moisture in top round you will need to increase heat to med High or high

This is an easy recipe that "almost" can be made with what I usually have on hand. (I don't stock that much garlic) I only had a large elephant garlic, so that had to do. I was pretty heavy with the hot sauce, as we like spicy. We really liked this recipe, I will make it part of my "easy go to weeknight recipes", guess it's time to stock up on lots of garlic :)
