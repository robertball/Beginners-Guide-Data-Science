Very delicious. I served the Raspberry Vinaigrette on the side since I was not sure what size bottle was used in the recipe. My family loved it.

I didn't think this was too shabby but my husband didn't like it. He thought he was thrown off by the red onion -- he just doesn't like onions. Anyway, I thought it was tasty and very easy to prepare.

I made this salad as a side dish to bbq'd steak tonight and it was pretty good.  I didn't use the bagged salad though, just tore up some romaine and added radicchio, carrot, cucumber, strawberry tomatoes (like grape tomatoes only a little bigger) an orange which I sectioned and the asparagus. Was a very filling salad and went well with the steak.
