Easy and tasty. I added some pinto beans in addition to the black beans (just because I like beans) and made this even easier on myself by throwing it into my little slow cooker! Thanks.

Excellent and SO easy to make!  I throw the ingredients in my crockpot in the morning--makes the flavors meld together better.  I also use vegetable or non-beef bouillon in place of plain water.  I like "hot" so I add a bit of cayenne pepper.  Even non-vegans love this!

Sautéed in white wine instead of oil. Used low-sodium vegetable broth instead of water. Added 2 jalapeños. Doubled up the cumin and added cayenne. Doubled up this revised recipe and let it cook quite a bit longer. Turned out great. Will make it again soon.

Delicious soup. I did add some mushrooms, corn, cayenne, salt & pepper. Used veggie broth instead  of the water. Sauteed veggies, then threw everything in the crockpot.  Wonderful easy dinner!

I love this. Have made it twice now. I am not a fan of slicing and dicing veggies so I use a little mini chopper food processor, so my veggies may be a little finer then they need to be, but it works for me. still has the flavor. My cloves of garlic seem to be on the large side, so I only use 1 and it seems to taste fine. I added a little pepper and chili powder for flavor on the 2nd batch, didnt really taste much difference from the first batch I made without adding anything. So I would say its good just like it is...but you can add what you want, but it doesn't need anything else.

It came out great! I used a bouillon instead of water and it was very tasty. I was nervous about adding cumin simply because it is not my favorite spice, but I needn't have worried. There was plenty of flavor and I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and very easy to make. I added some more water because my daughter likes its watery. It's very filling and quite healthy. I did wash the beans before cooking, and therefore added some salt. Definitely a recipe for a cold winter night!

It is a quick and easy soup that is quite filling.  I will definitely make it once or twice a month.

This recipe is a great start.  It’s really good as is but you can also be really creative with additional ingredients.  Add canned tomatoes or kick up the spice with chili flakes; add cilantro or garlic...you decide. I really like it served with a good dollop of sour cream and avocado.

This was just okay compared to many other soups that I have made from this site.  It needs more spice or something.  We found it to be quite bland.

I had to improvise because I didn't have cumin so I added a pinch or two of chili powder and almost a 1.5t of ground caraway seeds. 

Also, I sautéed everything in basil flavored olive oil and added two beef bouillon cubes when everything was simmering (I let it simmer for about 45 minutes).  

It was a hit in my family - my husband, sister-in-law and niece all loved it with toritilla chips.

Used the recipe as a guide. Added salt, pepper, Garam Masala and a little bit of sugar. Use whatever beans, veggies are available.
