Definitely the best french toast I have ever eaten.  I made fresh cinnamon/brown sugar bread and sliced it thick.  It turned out great.

Don't be tempted to not use the corn flakes!  They add a lot to the recipe.

I used Challah bread and Raisin Bran Crunch (minus the raisins) and it came out great.  The children loved it and they didn't even want syrup until I offered it to them (silly me)  The outside was crisp and the inside moist.  Loved it!

O.k., this was WAAAAY too messy, way too greasy and waaaay to sweet.  I would suggest using unsweetened cornflakes, as the recipe already has sugar in it.  When you add the syrup...sugar overload!  I can't imagine, as sweet as this recipe is, adding whipping cream on top of the syrup!

This is the best french toast I have ever had! I did make an adjustment though. All I had was frosted flakes, so I just didn't add any sugar to the egg mixture. It wasn't too overly sweet, just right. Also, (using normal white bread) I cut the slices in half on a diagonal before putting it in the egg mixture. That way it was easier to take in and out of the hot oil. It makes it look a lot nicer too. Oh..and I ate two piece's but it only works out to be one piece of bread, so it wont be as harsh on the waist line! I hated french toast til I found this recipe!

I never make it with the Corn Flakes. I also don't measure anything for this recipe (cinnamon junkie) - I just shake in until I think it's enough.  Add in some Almond Extract.  Fry in the oil until edges are crispy, and just a shade darker than golden.   Top with gobs of butter and powdered sugar.  Man, oh man - it's almost like a Carnival Mini Donut.

this is the perfect french toast recipe... but do not use the cornflakes.. it is sooo good without them..  i've had it with whole wheat, rye and just white bread. also make sure you mix the batter between each bread dipping because the egg and cinnamon floats to the top.

This was SOOOO YUMMY! It tastes like something from the fair. I didn't have any corn flakes so I just crumbled up some graham crackers instead, It made the oil very dirty, but still the best french toast I've ever had.

This was really good.  Better than I expected.  My wife loved it too.  Just for personal preference I cut the bread slices into fourths to make each slice smaller.  Also, I crushed up the corn flakes some until the corn flakes were roughly the size of M&Ms.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Will definitely be making this again.  The Crispy French Toast actually didn't taste fried or greasy.  It was just plain good.

Instead of cornflakes, I used Special K lowfat granola (first broke up the big pieces in a bag with a rolling pin). It was fabulous! I also pan fried with much less oil, placed on paper towels after frying to drain extra oil, reduced the sugar to the egg mixture, and didn't use syrup just a little butter.

tried this morning. it was nice and crunchy. I used cinnamon frosted flakes so I omitted the extra sugar in the egg but I added more cinnamon cause I love cinnamon. I also added about a tsp of vanilla. I took the advice of another reviewer and pan fried in less oil and finally I used Texas toast. 
a few things I noticed: Texas toast was perhaps not the best choice because the middle of some were soggy. I hate my heat set to med low and found the edges and corn flakes were burning before the middle would cook. the cornflakes make the oil smoke horribly. Finally it will go nicely with either butter and a small amount of syrup OR fresh fruit and whipped cream. ENJOY!!

Whoever rated it one star is smoking crack, THIS IS DELICIOUS!! Whoever rated this 5 stars, you get a pop tart.

Notice: We used rice crispies instead of cornflakes, turned out to be much less sweet. Don't put too much syrup on it, all of you will get a stomach ache like me XD.
