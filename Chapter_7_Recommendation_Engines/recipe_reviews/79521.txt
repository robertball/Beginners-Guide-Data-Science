Using the suggestions of some of the other reviewers, I didn't bother to brown the chicken first. [I'm of the same mindset, I want to have a one-pot meal and not bother dirtying other pots/pans] I put a cup of uncooked rice in the bottom of the crockpot first. I used scant powdered ginger instead of fresh, about 6 lightly smashed big cloves of garlic, and a couple of shots of teriyaki marinade & a splash or 2 of dry sherry.  I skipped the last thickening step with cornstarch; my "secret" to thickening many slow cooked soups and sauces is to add some instant mashed potatoes.  It came out great, the mashed potato wasn't noticable at all.  Everyone Loved It!

Easy recipe to make. I agree with most of the reviewers. I substituted four skinless, boneless chicken breasts for the recipe, and did not brown. Just put all of the marinade right into the crock pot, mixed it (careful of splashing), added the breasts, and cooked on high for 2 hours. THen lowered it to "low" for one hour, added the pineapple, 15 minutes, and done. Added cornstarch - thickened right up. Don't be deceived - the recipe smells WAY too "ginger-y" but does not taste that way. IF I was going to go strictly on scent, I would have said "this is going to be disgusting." When I tasted it, though, I was reminded that ginger is WAY more aromatic than it is gustatory, so it tastes very balanced. Thanks!

Wow, this dish is fabulous.  It reminds me of terriaki chicken but with a heavier garlic taste to it.  I made it with just 3 chicken breasts, because we didn't need any more than that.  I made the full amount of sauce.   I did brown my chicken in a frying pan sprayed with pam, however I believe that next time I will skip this part as it seems unnecessary.  The chicken turns a nice brown color from the sauce so it seems odd to try to brown it first as well.   I also did not have fresh ginger so I substituted 1 tsp of ground ginger.  I also did not have a can of pineapple tidbits. So I just put in one small can of pineapple juice, I think it was about 6 oz.  I also scooped out the little pieces of garlic before I put in my cornstarch mixture.  I think that next time I will leave the garlic whole and that will make it easier to take out later.  Of course this is just a personal preference not to have chunks of garlic in my sauce.  That is all that I changed and it turned out great!  I served it with white rice and put some of the sauce on the rice. My kids did not want to eat it at first, but after they tasted it they said it was good. Thank you!!!

Okay so the thing that attracted me to this recipe was the honey and garlic and slow cooker parts.  I stuck to the recipe to the letter and mine did NOT look anything like the picture.  I should have taken the advice of other reviewers to reduce cooking time.  My chicken was dark dark brown.  The sauce didn't thicken at all and so I had to pour it into a saucepan and boil it up - which sort of defeats my theory of using only the slow cooker for a meal.  Anyways, it was alright but as far as soy - ginger - garlic pineapple sauces go, I have had better.  Sorry, won't make this again.

Couple suggestions which might make this better: reduce soy sauce amounts, substitute some chicken broth like another cook suggested, use more ginger and honey...

This recipe was UNBELIEVABLE! I'm not a chicken person, but my husband is, and we BOTH loved this recipe.  I didn't use the 10 chicken thighs that the recipe called for.  Instead, I used a 1lb. package of chicken breasts and cut the recipe for the sauce in half (approx.)  I only had to cook the chicken for about 2 hours since there was so little compared to the original recipe - which was nice becuase I could still make it after work and eat at a decent hour.  I didn't even bother to thicken the sauce, and I served it over white rice.  SO flavorful - I'll be making this one on a regular basis.

So good!  My son loved it.  I served it with Jasmine Rice and broccoli.  It tasted like Chinese takeout, tastes close to General Tso sauce!  I did take the advice to not cook for the full recommended time, so it turned out perfect!

I have made this a bunch of times and it is always great. Make sure you check on it periodically – I’ve had the majority of the sauce evaporate on me. This recipe is so easy and the flavor is terrific.

My family loved this and I liked it, too.  I used chicken breasts (on bone with skin removed) and after 4 hours they were perfect.  I substituted a healthy amount of chopped candied ginger for the fresh with good results.  i didn't have other reviewers issue of one flavor overpowering the rest.  Flavors are strong, but well balanced.  Thank you for a great crock pot recipe that doesn't require cream soups from a can!

This was delicious, my husbad loved it!!! Although I did change it a bit based on other reviewers' comments and the ingredients I had on hand. I only had chicken tenderloins and after cutting out that darn white tendon, decided to cut the chiken into cubes. I put the unbrowned chicken in the crockpot on top of a few inces of sliced carrots. I added a bunch or green onions, sliced (inlcuding all the green part) on top of the chicken. The marinade/sauce consisted 1/3 c soy sauce, 1/3 c teriyaki marinade, 1/2 c honey, 3 tbsp ketchup, 2 tbsp grated (not minced) fresh ginger root, 3 heaping tsps of minced garlic. Just before serving I added a can of sliced water chestnus (personal preference). My husband thought the meal smelled so good, he didn't want to wait for me to thicken the sauce. This will become a regualr in our household.

This was really good and painfully easy to make.  I fried the chicken thighs in a non-stick pan with PAM so I didn't need the oil - other wise followed the recipe as written. Definately a keeper.

Really nice flavor.  I used chicken breast and baked it in the oven!  Turned out really tasty.  I also used crushed pineapple instead of tidbits!

I was attracted to this recipe first because it sounded delicious and second because it sounded like an easy crock pot recipe. I followed the recipe to the tee except I eliminated the browning the chicken first step. I made a big mistake not reading the reviews first because I thought I could turn the crockpot on low and let it cook 8 hrs while I was at work. This was a huge mistake, the chicken and the sauce burned the chicken was dried out, just terrible. I am writing this review so others do not make the same mistake. I will give this recipe another chance maybe on the weekend when I don't work. I will also update my rating after my next attempt.

Found this recipe when searching for something to do in the crock pot with my chicken thighs.  I didn't brown the chicken first and apparently (just learned) that I never added the cornstarch at the end...must have mixed it with everything else and forgot about it so my sauce was thin but I'm okay with it! In any case the recipe tasted like teryaki chicken to me but was delicious none the less. We served it over rice and I discovered that it was 3 times as good the next day after the leftover rice that I stored with the chicken and sauce had absorbed the flavor. It was AMAZING. Cooking it again for dinner tonight. :)

This came out ok overall.  I made some changes based on other reviews:   - Didn't brown the chicken first, just put slightly frozen thighs right into bottom of crockpot - this was perfect, chicken came out very tender and didn't dry out like it often does in the crockpot.  Also omitted the oil. - I had crushed pineapple, so I used that instead of tidbits, and dumped all ingredients except cornstarch over the raw chicken, stirred, and cooked on high 4 hours.  - Based on another review, I used mashed potato flakes instead of cornstarch - DON'T DO IT!  It gave the sauce an unappealing consistency; cornstarch would've been lots better.  With crushed pineapple, I think it needed a little more fluid to cook, so I added a little water.  Next time I'll add a little chicken broth, a little less soy sauce, and a little more garlic (LOVE garlic, and didn't taste much in this recipe).   This WAS easy to make, but as it turned out, just not stellar tasting.

On the fence about this recipe.  I thought it was just ok, not bad, but nothing special, but my 21 year old son and his friends loved it.  He requested that it be added to the make again list.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for decreasing the honey and soy sauce to 1/2 c. each instead of 3/4.  As noted by others, the sauce was very thin.  Mine did not thicken up, even with the corn starch.  I didn't want to bother boiling it down on the stove, so we just went with thin sauce.  Finally, as an experiment (and because I was running out of time), one package of chicken was browned and the other went in raw and still slightly frozen.  Other than a slight difference in color, there was no difference between the two packages.  So the browning step can definitely be eliminated without any ill effects on the final dish.

This was a nice surprise in lieu of plain ol' chicken. As other reviewers stated I didn't brown the chicken. I also took others advice and put 1 C of rice in the bottom of the crockpot. Then I simply removed the skin and place the drumsticks over the rice; mixed the sauce and poured over all. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a little less than 1 tsp of powder.  I only had a can of pineapple chunks but that worked out just as well. Next time I do think I'll just make the rice separate. It would be much more appealing. The way I did it there's not much sauce at all; the rice absorbed all the liquid.

YUM!  My husband and I had this for dinner last night and I will be making it again in a few days.  I didn't bother to remove the chicken thighs from the bone until I served them, and the flavor was amazing!  I think I might leave them on the bone the next time I make this also.  Based on how tender and juicy the thighs came out, I probably won't use chicken breasts with this recipes.  The meat was just so perfect.    My husband doesn't love cooked pineapples, so I still added the juice but omitted the actual pineapples.  Still delicious.  Thanks for sharing Tora.V!

Just OK. I just did'nt love it.  Definitely add more garlic(at least double) like other reviewers had said. I also added 1/2cup chicken broth. Cook in the crock on low for 4 1/2 hours. Chicken turned out tender and juicy.

We really enjoyed with these modifications.  Used 1/2 honey (was plenty), would have been to sweet with 3/4 C. Added some Sambal (ground fresh chile paste from the Asian asile section) to give a little heat, also added a can of water chestnuts and 4 green onions about 20 minutes before serving.  Used my Dutch Oven which I prefer.  We normally don't care for dark meat, however this was a exception very good.  I garnished with thinly sliced green onion, fresh pineapple (didn't add any to dish) and a sprinkle of black sesame seeds.
Will make again and will cut back a touch more on the honey, might do 1/4 C. honey and 1/4 C. Dark brown sugar for more depth of flavor.

This recipe was a winner In my house! I did change it a tad by using boneless skinless chicken breast and I cooked it on the stove. I didn't want to leave the chicken in the slowcooker all day for fear that it would overcook. I know I will be cooking this again!

Super!  I served with rice.  Didn't have enough soy sauce, but it still turned out great with a little less than 1/2 of what it called for.  Followed the recommendation to use pinnapple juice instead of chunks and we loved it.  This will be a regular.
VERY easy to through in and leave.

I didn't realize I was out of honey until I started cooking the chicken, so I used a little brown sugar instead.  I was very pleased with the flavor of the chicken but couldn't eat the pineapple in the sauce - it picked up way too much of the garlic/ginger flavor.  I also added some chicken broth to the soy sauce mix to lighten the flavor some.  I'll probably omit that next time and just use the pineapple juice instead of the fruit.  It truly does taste like teriyaki chicken so if you don't like teriyaki - stay away from this recipe.  I served it over rice w/ veggies on the side.  My son liked it but agreed that the pineapple chunks didn't taste very good and picked his out as well.

Made as written except I did do the option of making in oven with excellent results. I did halve the recipe also. Excellent taste and texture. As an added bonus the house smelled wonderful. I made rice on the side and yes, it was even better the next day. Very good recipe.

This recipe deserves 10 stars!!! I followed it almost exactly....the only changes I made was that I lightly floured the chicken thighs before browning them & I added an extra clove of garlic & a little crushed red pepper. I will never order chinese food again...this is far better than any chinese takeout!

This was a huge hit. I did not brown the chicken, however, I did season it before adding to the slow cooker. My niece (who lives with us) said it was the tastiest thing I've ever made in the slow cooker.

This is really good and I will definitely be making this again.  I followed the directions exactly.  I did use the chicken thighs and I did brown them.  Make sure you use fresh ginger.  The flavor is delicious.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to decrease the time it is cooked in the slow cooker.  I have a newer model slow cooker that is pretty big and since the thighs were browned and then put in mine were probably done in 2 hours on high and I cooked them for 3 before checking them and they were a little dried out.  Other than that everyone loved this meal.  I served it with broccoli and jasmine rice.

Made this tonight using frozen thighs with two substitutions : 1 small can of pineapple juice instead of pineapple pieces and with 1 tsp of ginger powder instead of fresh ginger. And I used 6 cloves of crushed garlic. (yumm!) Served over rice. I thought it was very, very good - the meat was VERY tender (fall of the bone) and very flavorful. Hubby said he'd give it 3.5 stars because most of the flavor was in the skin, not the meat itself.   Next time I make this I will make it the same way I did this time, however I'll take the skin off before cooking so the flavors can penetrate the thighs.  The only thing I may add next time is some crushed red pepper flakes (we loves spice!) to the sauce.  Overall, I give it a very good rating. :)  Yummm.. adding this to the monthly rotation. :) OH - BE AWARE THE FINAL SAUCE TASTES DIFFERENT BEFORE IT IS COOKED AND THE FLAVORS HAVE A CHANCE TO MARRY.  I wasn't really sure about the sauce, but after it cooked excellent! :)

This dish is super easy and the ingredients are all things you would keep in your kitchen. I go a little light on the soy sauce it can get pretty salty.

This was terrific.  My husband and I both loved it! I did not have fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger (it's not my favorite flavor, next time I won't use it at all).  I also don't see the need to brown the chicken first.  I served it over cooked rice.   Once again, a very easy, tasty meal ...  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and found the recipe to be absolutely delicious.  I combined chicken thighs and breast because I like dark meat, my husband likes white meat.  I didn't brown the chicken first, it gets brown enough when cooked.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing with the ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was so easy to make! I skipped the step of browning the meat as one reviewer suggested and I added 1 c. of rice and fresh green beans. I also added a ton more ginger because it's my fav. flavor! It was a whole meal in a pot and delicious. The meat was falling off the bone, the sauce was sweet and spicy from the ginger and honey, the green beans tender and the rice was creamy with a caramelized base as I placed the rice on the bottom of the pot. My husband says it's a keeper!

I don't understand why people are saying that this has no flavor, if they followed the recipe it should have amazing flavor! The sauce is amazing and thickens up nicely! I think this is a great recipe! Really good flavor and it smells fabulous while it's cooking! My husband and 2 year old loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

I am surprised by some of the more negative reviews, I thought this recipe was excellent. I had it on high for 3 hrs in the slow cooker and added coarsely chopped onion & green pepper at the start of cooking.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

I've made this several times now. It's good, and easy to put together. But, after using thighs the first time, I've used breasts ever since. I halve the recipe for four breasts, and cut the cooking time back to around 2.5 hrs on High. It just gets too dried out if cooked much longer. Exact measurements for the other ingredients is not important. Have served this with risotto.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs, because that's what I had.  I made the marinade the night before and refrigerated it in a bowl; this way I was able to put it together before work. This was a quick and easy crock pot meal.

I thought it was fabulous!  I was worried the soy sauce would be too overpowering, especially since I used regular instead of lite, but it was super.  I didn't measure out the exact amount of cornstarch, just used what I thought it would take.  If it doesn't thicken up like you want it to, just use more.  This recipe is DEFINATELY a keeper.

I should have known that the soy sauce would overpower the other flavors. I followed the recipe, and my chicken just tasted like really sweet soy sauce. My family didn't like it. I like the idea of honey and garlic but it tastes like neither, if I make it again I will replace the soy sauce w/ chicken broth, maybe a little soy sauce, and also less pineapple juice. The dish isn't bad, but the name doesn't represent the flavor.

Well as I was putting it all together I realized that I didn't have any pineapple (thought I did). I used Mandrin Oranges instead. I added some regular OJ to the sauce (the juice from the canned fruit is mostly water).  After it had cooked for about 3 hours. I tasted the sauce and thought it needed more flavor. So I added a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I let it go for another hour and then added in the fruit and some cornstarch mixed with juice from the mandrin oranges and about 2 tablespoons on rice wine vinegar. After it thickenen we had it over brown rice.  I know that I changed it alot but it was a great starting point to get what I got.  I am definately going to try this with the pineapple...(it's on my grocery list!!)  I think with the pineapple and the juice there would be great flavor!  Really good, thanks for the recipe!!

This is spectacular! We all loved it, my husband and I and my 4 kids. Just perfect, I made no changes to the recipe, it's so good just the way it is. The chicken was tender and fell apart as I removed it from the slow cooker, and it was so delicious!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. We eat a lot of chinese food and found this to be quite similar (not as bold tasting though) as take-out! I only had 8 chicken thighs but it worked well since they were all covered by the liquid. I added and extra clove of garlic and only about 3/4 T of ginger. Cooked on high for about 3 hours and the meat was so tender it was falling apart! Served over top of cooked rice. Definitely a keeper. mmmmmm.

I really liked it.  I only used 3 chicken breast.  Found it was a little dry, for less chicken I should have shortened the cook time.  My husband asked that I use a little less ginger next time.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I was looking for something delicious and simple to make with some unused chicken thighs we had sitting in our freezer so they wouldn't go to waste.  This recipe turned out exactly what I hoped for!  Very yummy without a whole lot of cook time from me.  I didn't have any Ginger Root, so I did substitute the it with 1 teaspoon of ground Allspice instead, as well as I didn't have any pineapple either so I cut up 3 large oranges( which were also going to waste), mashed it up, and reserved the orange juice and used that for pineapple juice.  The dish still turned out great and Im putting in on my "family favorites" list!

This was a excellent & easy recipe that my family enjoyed!! After reading the reviews I decided to skip the browning of the thighs in the skillet. I did not have ginger root so I used 1 tbsp of ginger powder. At the end of the 4 hours in the crockpot I removed the thighs & instead of thickening with the cornstarch/water I used plain instant potato flakes as another reviewer suggested, this did not alter the flavor of the dish but it was a thicker gravy. I then returned chicken to crockpot a long with pineapples for about 10 more minutes. Served with rice & a side dish of broccoli. Thanks Tori for this recipe??

Delicious! I did not cook the chicken ahead of time, this particular recipe may actually be improved (in texture and flavor) by skipping that step. I mixed all that stuff up right in the crock pot, put in the chicken, followed another reviewer's advice to put it on high 2 hours & low one hour and the results are delicious! I'd say the pineapple is not optional. It's like Chinese food, but better because I know everything that went in it! (Like low sodium soy sauce and no MSG)

It was a huge success! Easy and delicious. I made the following changes:
1. I skinned the chicken and did not brown it.
2. I mixed the liquid ingredients in the crock pot. (Why dirty another bowl?)
3. I used 1/2 cup honey. (Hint: When measuring honey, spray the cup with non-stick spray and the honey will pour right out)
4. I used some red chili flakes for a touch of heat.
5. I used pineapple juice, but not chunks.
6. I added sliced scallions and fresh broccoli toward the last.

I brined my chicken thighs in salt and granulated garlic for 24 hrs -- did not try to brown but just put in the slow cooker.  If you brine first, then watch the salt -- use maybe 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead.  I did the rest of the recipe as written and did cook on high in the slow cooker for 4 hours.  The chicken was AWESOME esp over Jasmine rice.  Very moist and tender!  I had no problems thickening the sauce with the cornstarch slurry.  You have to stir it for several minutes before it thickens.  In fact, I like to get out the Braun hand blender and give the sauce a nice buzz -- it really thickens the gravy up.  This is a wonderful comfort food recipe!

Delish! A few changes. I used 5 chicken breasts instead of 10 thighs but made the same amount of sauce. Which was terrific over rice. Next time I may put in more pineapple because we all really enjoyed that part of the dish. The left overs were Amazing!!!!

BEST SLOW COOKER EVER! I don't bother browning the chicken, I just throw it in the crock with a little EVOO and add some veggies...broccoli and cauliflower this time. Served with rice. My husband has requested this numerous times and I'm making it for a friend who just had a baby. DELICIOUS!

I bought chicken thighs on sale and removed the skins.  I also added a cup of uncooked rice to the bottom of the slo-cooker.  I did not precook the thighs and put them on top of the rice.  I then poured on the rest of the ingredants.  I put my slo-cooker on low for 6 hours and it turned out WONDERFUL.  The rice soaked up the juices so I served the thighs on top of the rice.   I did find ground fresh Ginger in my supermarket right next to the minced Garlic and used that.  NO FUSS and NO MESS.  My family of 4 cleaned out the pot and asked for more.  "GREAT ONE"

I followed this recipe except for two small changes - I used chicken breast and tenders.  Secondly, I didn't fry my chicken before placing it into the crock pot.  I didn't really enjoy the finished product too much.  My 3 year old daughter took one taste and that was it.  I will not be making this again.

Very good and quite easy.  The gravy this makes is really good--I served with mashed potatoes and actually put gravy on the potatoes myself, which I never do.  I completely forgot the pineapple chunks; we'd already eaten half of dinner when I remembered, so I just left them off.  I cut back on the soy sauce a bit as well and we couldn't tell at all.  This makes a decent weeknight meal--and it is easy enough to put together the night before, pop in the fridge, then put in the slow cooker before leaving for work.  Thanks for the recipe!

OK. Not my favorite. I did use breasts instead of thighs, but I'm going to keep looking for something I like better.

It was really good! I used powdered ginger and couldn't really taste it, next time I will use fresh.  I used 2 chicken legs which took 3 1/2 hours to took in the crock pot.

This is a great mid-week family meal - better than just an ordinary chicken dinner.  But I found the sauce a little too sweet & w/ so much of it left over, I didn't know what to do with it - too sweet for a gravy & you don't need that much of it to top the chicken.  Is there a way to make it not so sweet as it would be great to use as a gravy to serve w/ potatoes along side?  Regardless, chicken turned out perfect and flavorful (I cooked on high for 1 hour, then low for 5 hours - no knife needed - perfect!)

I use boneless chicken breast, only add 2 Tblsp soya sauce..and also add 2 Tblsp Lemon Juice along with 1/4c orange juice, 1/4 chicken broth...substiitude  garlic with 1 Tblsp minced..eliminate ginger...and get a great sweet & sour sauce.  Also add 1 Red pepper (cut in strips) and 1 Cup chopped brocolli or zuccine in last 15min of cooking. Great meal

This was delicious. I added in some thinly sliced onion but that was about the only change in the ingredients. I cooked this on high for 2 hours and then low for another hour, adding in the pineapple for the last 20 minutes or so. I thicken the sauce up a bit on the stovetop with cornstarch. Next time I make this I won't bother browning the breast because with the sauce on top, you couldn't see that anyway.

This was very good, I made it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and it turned out fine.  Next time I will omit the pineapples and just use the pineapple juice.  Also, I had to add a little extra cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken up.

MUST be served over something.  It has a VERY strong flavor that is overwhelming if not balanced by rice or something else.  Very easy to make with simple ingredients.  I used half of the chicken called for and it allowed for more sauce.  Good for company.

I served this with fried rice and salad.  I made it for guests and everyone loved it!I left the bone in the thighs and did not change the cook tome.  The meat fell right off the bone!  I will serve this often.

We added a thinly sliced onion, as well as one yellow and one green pepper, and an extra clove of garlic.  Needed to sub in 1t dried ginger and only had about 1/2C soy sauce, so made up the rest with water.  One small, fresh pineapple gave us just enough for the meal. Browned the chicken in a dutch overn, then simmered in the sauce on the sovetop for about an hour and ate with rice and carrots.  Good flavor.

Was easy to make. First attempt I took a reviewer's advice and put uncooked rice at the bottom of the slow cooker. BAD IDEA! The rice soaked up all the sauce! Second attempt. I followed the original recipe. Perfect! Added steamed veg and creamy mash as a side.

Great dish!  I will definitely make this meal again.  The chicken was a little dry, so next time I wont cook the chicken in the slow cooker for as long.  Other than  that, this was a delicious recipe.

I'm sure probably some of the issues we faced were user error, but it didn't look too appetizing once it was done cooking (the soy sauce turned the chicken a funky brown color). The taste of it was pretty good, through. I wish I wouldn't have added the cornstarch to the sauce once it was done because it made it taste a little chalky. Probably won't make this recipe again, but it was worth giving it a try!

Made this in a skillet instead of a crackpot. I also used chicken breast ( cut into large bite size pieces ) instead of thighs. Cut the soy, honey, ketchup and pineapple down a little. My family of four Loved it!

I thought this recipe was excellent just the way it is written. We can buy chicken thighs so cheaply at our grocery store, that I wouldn't even bother with breasts -- save those for the grill! I have purchased the bone-in/skin style before when they are on sale and just removed the skin prior to preparing, then removed the bones at the end before serving. Thanks for this recipe. My husband loves Asian/rice dishes and this one has become a new family favorite.

This was pretty good. I  did brown the chicken, I thought I had a can of pineapple tidbits but it was just slices and only 8oz. I used the juice that I could from that then just cut the pineapple up later. Could have used more of the pineapple juice but that's my fault. I do think next time I would only use the juice and not the pineapple. My family didn't like biting into hot pineapple. Served over rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious and perfect over rice. It definitely doesn't take the full amount of time to cook, so watch the liquid level, cause it will start to evaporate.

Easy to make and my husband usually bbq's the chicken thighs but said these were absolutely delicious. We will have this again. I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this exactly the way the recipe said to. It was really good, but it could use some more seasoning. Maybe more garlic? It's something I'd make again though and it smelled wonderful cooking in the crockpot. I cooked it on low heat for 6 1/2 hours instead of on high for 4 hours.

This was a snap! I didn't brown the chicken ahead of time, and just put them in raw and it was fine. IMHO a slow cooker meal shouldn't require other pots/pans in addition to the slow cooking! I also happened to have fresh pineapple so I chopped it up and squeezed it and used the fresh juice instead. It did not look ANYTHING like the photo that's showing with this recipe -- much, much darker -- but it turned out deliciously and I will definitely make this again. Yum.

absolutely great recipe - super easy and children loved it with cooked penne mixed in at the end rather than rice - rice is just a hairy mess with a one and a two year old trying to feed themselves.  i  did use a george foreman grill to brown the chicken which was a cinch to do.

The sauce was fantastic, however the chicken was too dry and I cooked on high for 2 hours then low 1 hour.  I used boneless chicken breasts and next will cook on low for 2 hours or check after an hour.  I also added some sweet chili sauce to give it a little kick.  I served  with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.

This was good. Like sweet and sour chicken. I removed the skin. I think this helps absorb the flavor and it reduces the amount of fat.

This was awesome. I used a whole family pack of de-skinned chicken drumsticks.  I also used fresh garlic. Instead of frying this in oil on the stove, I used the oil and coated the chicken in a large bowl with a little salt/pepper and broiled the legs until browned, like I would wings. I then proceeded with the recipe as stated. This turned out wonderfully and the chicken just fell off the bone. I used a cup or so of the "juice" that the chicken cooked in to make Day After Payday Fried Rice. SO GOOD. I'm making this again for sure.

The chicken was way too sweet, I couldn't taste the garlic at all and chicken was dark, almost black, and rubbery. The only things that I did different were to reduce the honey to 1/4 cup and increase the garlic to 6 cloves and still it was too sweet and overall disappointing. I don't think i'll be trying this again anytime soon.

Definitely skip the browning...the chicken turns a nice brown color and you'll further dry it out by browning.  That being said, this really tastes like teriyaki chicken to me, not honey garlic.  It wasn't bad...the sauce is good on rice.  However, it was not kid friendly here - my kids love anything chicken and did not love this.  I didn't mind it - I'd actually rate it a 3 but it's not terrible tasting so I bumped it up to 4.  No problems with dryness - but watch your slow cooker...the new ones cook way hotter and 4 hours on high with those new ones definitely is too much, especially with chicken breasts.  If you are using chicken breasts, use the thicker ones - any slow cooker recipe I've tried with chicken breasts always turns out better with the thicker breasts.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used bone-in and skin on chicken thighs because that is what I had. It turned out well. I didn't add the pineapple tidbits. I think 4 hours on high would have been way too much. I turned it to low after 3 hours. It was still a little dry so I think 2 hours on high and then another hour on low is a good idea. Also, I had no problem with the cornstarch thickening up the sauce. Good crockpot recipe for chicken thighs! Thanks.

I made this last night and we absolutely loved it.  I used bone in thighs and did not brown them first.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but followed the cooking suggestions of others and cooked them for 2 hours on high, followed by 1 hour on low. I did put the corn starch right in with the thighs after the first hour of cooking. There were 8 thighs for 3 of us and we had nothing left.  They were very tender and not dry at all  I served with rice and used the sauce on the rice.  Delicious!  This is a definite keeper.

This was very dissapointing (especially since it smelled sooo good cooking). Followed recipe as written except added sliced oinions and red peppers. The meat was extremely dry. My husband did eat it so that's why it gets 2 stars. Oh well, on to the next one.

This was the worst recipe I have made on this site!  It turned out so dry and I really didn't like the flavours...and the "gravy" really didn't work as a gravy.  Sorry but I definitely do not recommend this recipe and I will not be making it again

This was great. It kind of reminds me of the bourbon chicken in the food court at the mall. I used thighs with bone but no skin just because that is what I had on hand. The chicken falls apart after cooking so the bones were easy to remove. I used powdered ginger and did not thicken the sauce with cornstarch. I served this over brown rice. Delicious!

This was pretty good, but could have used something else in the sauce to give it more texture.  I turned the slow cooker down to low after 2 hours as not to overcook the chicken.  I didn't add the pineapple to the sauce, but rather put it on top of the chicken on our plates.  The cornstarch did not work in thickening the sauce, and rather than wasting a whole box of corn starch, I just gave up and served the sauce thin over rice.

This was a delicious Chinese knock-off. The only thing that could have been better was that the sauce did not thicken as much as I would have liked. I served it over white rice with broccoli.

WOW.  My husband (who has no cooking ability) made this and it was fab-u-lous. He change the serving size to two, and he even cooked rice to go with it...with all the same ingrediants (other than pineapple and gingeroot) that went with the chicken.  Much to my suprise it was wonderful.

Delicious recipe.  I added more garlic than called for and it turned out great. The ginger flavor was very strong - next time I will probably only use a little over a teaspoon.  A tablespoon is way too much.

A-Mazing! My husband who NEVER cooks made this for a party and it was soooo easy and absolutely wonderful! I would add a little more cornstarch to make it thicker.

There is some strange flavor that this recipe makes, whatever it is, not a good combination. Will not make again.

We did not enjoy this recipe at all.  The chicken was dry, and the sauce just wasn't what I expected, there was way too much honey for us.

Very Good!  I love that there are just a few ingredients, and I can just throw them in the Crock Pot and Dinner is ready when I get home.  It has amazing flavor, for so little effort.  My kind of recipe!  I will definitely make this again.

I hate cooking. A lot. But this was easy and the chicken turned out perfect. Like many of the others, I skipped the browning step. I also substituted orange juice for pineapple and did not use the tidbits at the end. My husband is insanely picky and he absolutely loved this meal.

Easy, quick and delicious! I served it with broccoli and rice and used frozen chicken tenderloins (it's what I had). Based on other reviews, I cooked it on high for 2 hours, low for 1, added the pineapple chunks for 15 minutes and then pulled out the chicken to thicken the sauce. Can't wait to make it for my hubby, who's currently out of town. My 3 year old loved it. :-)

This came out very tender and very tasty. Whole family liked it...even the kiddo! Half way thru cooking, I added carrots and potatoes and made it a complete one pot meal. Will probably try it with breasts next time and serve with rice. Thanks for the recipe :)

This was VERY tasty!   My 16 yr. old loved the sauce.   I doubled the sauce and used powdered ginger.  I also used chicken breast and cut it into large chunks to cut down on cooking time in the crockpot because I started it later than I had planned.   I will DEFINITELY make this again because my family asked me to even before they had finished eating!

This was DELICIOUS!  I also, had to modify it and only use what I had on hand.  I used ginger powder instead of fresh ginger and I used pineapple juice (20 oz) because I didn't have the crushed pineapple but those were the only changes I made and I think the added juice made all he difference for adding moistness to the chicken.  I made it with the Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews from this site and Jasmine rice and it was a HUGE hit! Better than most chinese takeout!

This was delicious! I went ahead and mixed all the ingredients up in the slow cooker before adding a 6lb whole chicken (skin removed.) I cooked it for one hour on high and four hours on low, flipping the chicken halfway through. I didn't brown my chicken or make gravy from the drippings. Everyone loved it.

This was great! The family loved it for dinner. I made it as the recipe stated except I used fresh pineapple and added some minced onion. I was going to cook it in my slow cooker, but I used my electric skillet instead. I cooked it for a few hours. I used bone-in chicken thighs and breasts. The meat was very tender.

This was a hit in our family!  I did not bother to brown the chicken like some reviewers said and it was fine. I also had run out of garlic so I just used about 1/2 tsp or so of garlic powder. My only complaint is that the chicken was a bit dry. Next time I may try bone-in thighs or try cooking boneless on low. Either way, this recipe is a keeper!

This was excellent. So easy to make too. Full of flavor. I served it with sushi rice and broccoli. I made it in an enamel cast iron pot. I browned the chicken on the stove top, added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it in the oven for 3 hours at 325. I will definitely make it again! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is fantastic!  Like others, as it was cooking i wasn't so sure... I only made a few adjustments and it was amazing... 1st i used bone in, skin on thighs because they were what i had on hand... 2nd i did not brown the meat... i also cut back the soy sauce to 1/2 cup... set the crock on high and cooked for 3.5 hrs... came out almost perfect... i think if i could have cut out that last 1/2 hr it would have been perfect... also did not add the pineapple chunks to the mix but put it on the side along with white rice and dribbled the sauce over everything... my 6year old son and husband devoured it

halved the chicken, cooked on high for 2hours, and placed sweet potatos on bottom ( I have a 6qt slow cooker). Good but I think i'm going to add cumin and paprika next go around.

I was alittle disappointed with this at first but ended up loving it. The chicken with the sauce alone was alittle strong fo my families tastes but after I mixed in some rice and veggies it was much better. I think next time I will cut back the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and see how that goes or maybe use it as a stir fry sauce instead.

Smelled so good whilst cooking in the crockpot.  I think I would prefer breasts over thighs as it's not like it was cooking all day to dry them out.

The dish was okay to eat the first day. I would recommend not using chicken breast as it tends to be on the dry side. I'm sure it would taste better with dark meat. The pineapple taste was bit overpowering, and becomes stronger on the 2nd day. Recommend using pineapple tidbits as opposed to chunks. Overall a creative recipe.

I was really hopeful about this recipe. Honey Garlic combo sounds good but I tasted no garlic at all. It was too sweet. The chicken was dry and the 'sauce' was so dark. I did not make any substitutions at all and followed the directions. I am not sure how the recipe picture turned out so light with 3/4 cup of soy sauce.

Not one of my favorites.  Normally I like sweet sauces, but this one was too sweet for me, and even though I added extra garlic I could hardly taste it against the sweet honey taste. This was nice and easy though, so if I try it again I will definitely cut down on the honey and add some other things to counter the sweetness.

enjoyed it, lots of sauce with nice flavor. I cooked on the stove top using frozen boneless skinless chicken tenders. I did not defrost them just put them in my covered pan. It was fast and ready in an hour. Thank you!

This is incredibly good. My two year old even asked for seconds and he's going through a picky phase right now. I used drumsticks that I had on hand, cooked them on low for 8 hours and then switched the crockpot to warm until we were ready to eat. The leftovers were great for lunch. We'll have this often, thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family and I LOVED this recipe. It's so simple and easy to make. After reading some of the review I didn't brown my chicken before putting it into the slow cooker. Next time I think I'll add a little less ginger and I saved 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice to mix with the corn starch. Will definitely be doing this one again soon.

I have made this twice now...once with and once without skin. The family all likes it better with the skin and finished in the broiler to give it a "sticky" finish. The texture is a bit weird without the finish in the broiler. Do not cook longer than recommended as I did the 1st time and it fell apart too much. Great recipe, Thank You!

My family tried this recipe tonight and it was soooo good:) Usually I don't like chicken thighs, but my mom gave me a big tray of them, and I don't like to waste food. I didn't have the pineapple, so I used juice from a can of mandarin oranges. I also omitted the ginger. To thicken up the sauce I whisked together equal parts of water/flour- 2Tbls of each with the sauce and brought it to a boil on the stove. When it was done, we couldn't even tell that they were chicken thighs (a good thing) the sauce compliments the meat very well. I served this with Basmati Rice and green peas. This recipe was loved by my hubby (pretty picky)  my 11 year old son, and my 1.5 year old son. This is a definate keeper!

I didn't have the pineapple, so I substituted homemade chicken stock for the reserved pineapple juice.  I didn't have lite soy sauce and used the rest of the regular soy sauce I had, about 1/4 cup.  I love garlic, so I used 6 cloves and halved them for easy removal later.  Also used 1 tsp of ground ginger. Although I used so many substitutions, it was really good!  I thickened with 4 tbsp cornstarch.

My husband thought this was pretty good, I really liked it well, though.  I did cut back on the soy sauce and only used 1/3 cup.  It was plenty!  I also used  1 tsp on ginger because I didn't have any fresh on hand.  For the chicken, I used 8 skinless, bone-in thighs and cooked them on high for 4 hours, and my hubby thought they were a little dry.  Next time I will cook on high for an hour, and on low for about 4-5 hours instead.

This recipe is yummy!  I usually have to change/add ingrediants to recipes a little in order for me to really like it, but on this one, I didn't have to change/add a thing!  I've already made it 3 times!!!  My 17 month year old and husband love it too!

I had some plans on a Saturday afternoon, so I threw this together in a crockpot, cooked it on low for 4 hours. I must have done something wrong because it was absolutely horrible, too much soy or something. I had to throw it out.  I'm sure there is a better way to make this but I apologize, my house smelled for hours because of this dish. I might try it again if I can stay home and monitor the cooking of this.

My 5-year-old, who can be picky at times, asked for three servings of this meal. I cooked it on low for six hours and used pancake syrup instead of honey. (Didn't have honey in my pantry) I also did cook the chiken ahead of time for just a few minutes. I then served it with jasmine rice and a side of vegetables. It was a great dinner.

Not bad!  I made this recipe as the original specified, but cut the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and used lite, used 12 drumsticks with the skin removed and upper the amount of garlic to about a tablespoon of jarred minced garlic.  I also skipped the frying part at the beginning and just put them right in the crockpot.  The sauce is very, very watery, but I didn't think that was an altogether bad thing.  I served the chicken over brown rice and steamed broccoli and spooned some of the pineapple and a little sauce over the top of it.  I think if the sauce were too thick, it might have ended up being too overwhelming and salty.  Will probably make again because it was so fast and easy.  Might even be good as a potluck appetizer with chicken drummies instead?

This was delicious and devoured by my daughter!  I do not agree with changing to chicken breasts.  There is a definite taste difference between thighs and breasts.  I think the warm taste of the thighs is appropriate for this dish and something would definitely be lost if you used chicken breasts.  I did not have lite soy sauce, only regular, but it still tasted great.  I did everything as directed, even browning the chicken, and the dish was great.  The only down fall is the sauce was very runny, but the rice absorbed it quite nicely.

Great recipe!  I followed it for the most part.  But I added less soy sauce and a tad more honey.  Smelled great and my picky girlfriend loved it!However I might add chunk pineapple instead of crushed.  It was hard to drain the crushed.

The other reviews really helped for this recipe.  I only cooked the chicken for 2 hours on high in the slow cooker, then i broiled the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side and it turned out delcious.  The sauce is strong, but tasty.  I also had to boil the sauce while the chicken was baking and i added 3 tblsp of corn starch instead of 2, to get it thick.

This wasn't so great...just okay really. i followed the recipe but used chicken breast instead. it didn't seem to have that much flavor so i added a little bit more honey, cayenne pepper and a dash of chinese 5 spice which made it taste better. the sauce was very watery so i transfered it to a saucepan to thicken it up. served it over jasmine rice with broccoli. boyfriend liked it but i don't think i will be making this one again atleast not in the slow cooker. this would come out way better on the stove or even baked in the oven.

This was delicious!  It tasted just like Panda Express's mandarin chicken, which I love.  I didn't brown the chicken before putting it in the slow cooker.  I cooked it for two hours on high, and then an hour on low, based on other reviews.  I tried to thicken the sauce in the slow cooker, but ended up putting it in a saucepan and heating it on the stove.  In all the excitement of thickening the sauce, I forgot to add the pineapple!  Whoops!  My husband isn't crazy about chicken thighs, so I think I will try this with chicken breasts next time to appease him. ;)

This was AMAZING!!!! I did not fry this before putting it into the cooker. The soy sauce gave it the best color. I thought it was going to be to much soy sauce but the honey really balanced this out. I only used 4 boneless chicken breasts but kept the recipe for the sauce the same. We love sauce!!! Also, my sauce didn't come out all thick like black molasses as I read in another review. Thanks for coming up with this!!!! KUDOS to you.

Not a fan of this recipe at all. I followed the recipe to the letter and the chicken was dry, the sauce runny, and found that the sauce was a little too sweet. Will not be making this recipe again, what a waste.

I'm giving this 5 even though I burned the heck out of it. It smelled wonderful and the flavor of the sauce was great! The chicken was dry enough I could have used it as a sponge, but that was my fault. I will make it again, hopefully in a better crock pot.

This was such a yummy recipe. The only thing we had to alter was the cooking time. After 2 hours I switched the temp on low and kept an eye on the chicken. Only kept it in the pot another 45 minutes. So 4 hours would've been definitely too long. Other than that, this is a keeper recipe.

I won't make this again. I followed the recipe to the letter, yet my chicken turned out very, very, dark - like black sludge!!  It didn't look at all like the picture.  It had a very strong vinegar taste to it (probably too much soy sauce).  The unfortunate part of it, is that based on the great reviews, I made a large batch. I almost hate to have to eat what's left. Sorry, this recipe is just not for me.

I made this with chicken wings, and boy, was it a hit! My eight year old had seven wings! I used less soy sauce and more ketchup, and cooked on low for about eight hours. It was excellent.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the best recipe I've found on this sight.  My 5 year old calls it "Honey Chicken" and would eat it every night. I've made it at least a dozen times.  SO GOOD!

Very tasty.  I didn't have any pineapple on hand, so I substituted some mixed berry applesauce instead, which gave it a mellow fruity flavor.  My boyfriend raved about it, and was excited about the leftovers the next day!

We added some cayenne pepper at the end; it's even better the next day when the meat is shredded and absorbs the sauce.

Tried this the other night and it was a hit with the family.  I didn't hear one complaint!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was I did not like it.  It tasted too much like teryaki and I'm not a big fan of teryaki.  I will definitely make this again for the family.

This has become a staple at my house.  I leave out the pineapple chunks and just use canned pineapple juice. (personal preference) Otherwise follow the recipe exactly. It is great with rice.

Great, easy recipe.  Sauce was a little runny though.  If cooking less chicken, definitely lessen time.  Mine started frozen and were done in 2.5 hours, slightly dry.  I loved the recipe!  Didn't have kethcup, still seemed fine! (maybe that was the runny issue?)

This was really great, and so easy to make!  I got regular chicken thighs and pulled the skin off them before browning and picked the bones out after cooking.  I packed some in my boyfriend's lunch and he said it was the highlight of his day!  This really tastes like good chinese.  I will surely make this again.

This turned out okay, my husband liked it, and he won't usually eat dark meat.  The taste wasn't quite what I was expecting - a little too dark, somehow.  I added more honey at the end, but it still didn't seem quite right.

Mmmmmm.  Served this to family and everyone enjoyed it - no leftovers.  I used rice flour to thicken rather than corn starch (due to a corn allergy) and it worked wonderfully.  Yummy and easy to prepare, chicken was soooo tender!

This was a hit in our house! Some changes to original recipe:  Used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and followed another reviewers cooking time: high for 2 hours then low for 1 hour. I added in the pineapple in 30 minutes before serving. Used ground ginger and minced garlic (about 4 tablespoons). Served with broccoli and brown rice. Leftovers for tomorrow and then I’ll snap a picture-forgot to do that tonight

I loved it!! My family thought it was just ok. The set-it-and-forget-it ease of the slow cooker is always a win for me, and of course my garlic and ginger came from a bottle in the cupboard instead of mincing it myself (ha!), but this chicken is super tasty with some rice and steamed veggies. Sprinkle on some peanuts and sesame seeds after plating = yum.

I tripled the recipe. Only had 1 tsp of basil. Other than that I followed recipe to the T.  The thighs were way too salty. (maybe should have used low salt soya sauce).  I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar and it was better.  On top of the basmati rice was again a bit better. I will try this recipe again.  But I will use low salt soya sauce and cut the quantity in half.

this was awesome! easy but definately dont ignore the low sodium part for the soy sauce. I had to add some orange slices and brown sugar to try to balance out the salt. in the end though was something even the picky toddlers.

Wasn't bad, I had to cook it a bit longer as I was at work and the chicken really shrunk, but the taste was there and I served it over brown rice to make it healthy.

Easy to make. Chicken was so tender, not spicy. I only put in crock pot for 3 1/2 hours instead of 4. The pineapples added a great taste

Sauce was too thin, and not as great as I had hoped.  I will make it again, but I'll add some peppers (and more garlic), and put the sauce on the stove for about 15 minutes to let it thicken more.

Should not have cooked it as long as others said, and agreed that pan searing was not necessary and contributed to over cooked chicken.  Came out dark brown and way to much liquid at the end.  Sauce was ok but I've had much better/more flavor even after adding some white pepper and 1 minced serrano.

This was pretty yummy!  Like most, I didn’t brown the meat first. And I’m really glad I didn’t!!  It was plenty brown from the crockpot and the meat was so tender!  Fell right off the bone (yes, I accidentally didn’t buy boneless thighs). I also put rice in the bottom of the pot, although I’m not necessarily sure I’ll do that again. It prevented any sort of “sauce” and it turned into more of a flavored rice bed. Not a bad thing, just wasn’t what I was going for. The meal was really quite delicious and my family was thrilled with it!  I’ll definitely make this again!

This was delicious. I made it for a church potluck and everyone asked for the recipe. I usually don't post a review unless I followed the directions exactly, but this really is a keeper. The ONLY difference I made was that I cubed the chicken and browned it instead of using the whole thighs which made it good for a crowd. I will definitely be trying it without any changes next time.

I thought this turned out really well. Changes I made: I only used 1/2 a cup of soya sauce as that's all I had on hand and found this to be adequate, I only used the juice from the pineapple as I didn't really feel like eating pineapple chunks with my chicken, and I used jarred minced ginger instead of freshly grated. Turned out great and it was easy to make. Will make again!

Much, much too salty! Chicken was very tender. If the soy sauce were reduced to a fraction of what the recipe calls for, this might be good.

I found this recipe sort of boring. I followed the advice of many and added corn starch to the sauce at the end. I regretted that because it made the sauce stick to the chicken a lot more and I ultimately did NOT want that much sauce. I really just wasn't a fan of the sauce. I personally would have given this 2 stars, but my hubby, who is rather picky about most things that I make, shrugged and said it was "OK," so I guess that is worth another star. I really don't plan on making this again, though. I was sort of bummed when I realized I needed to finish the leftovers...

I used 3 boneless breasts and skipped the browning step.  I could on high for 3 hours and could have shortened the time.  The flavor is very good, even better the next day.

Sauce was good but the chicken ended up super dry. It says to brown the chicken first but I think with the 4 hours on high in the cooker that just over cooked the chicken. May try again with putting semi or raw chicken in the cooker. 4 hours is plenty of time to cook the chicken through.

This reminds me of a luau chicken I had in Hawaii... It's nice and tender; yummy over rice or quinoa. I used agave syrup only because the hubby dislikes honey. It came out great! Will definitely make this dish again.

This was good, I will make again.  Like many of the other reviewers suggested, next time I won't brown the chicken.  I used a low sodium soy sauce but both my husband and I thought the sauce was bordering on being too salty so I may reduce the amount of soy the next time I make it.

My whole family absolutely loved this!  The sauce was thinner than I thought it would be but still very good.  I didn't add the chunks of pineapple because I knew that would be too much texture for my kids so I used pineapple juice.  I didn't bother to brown the chicken to simplify the cooking.  Served over rice with the sauce it was wonderful!

I made this using vegetarian 'chicken'. It was delicious. I think that next time I will stick to the actual cooking times in the recipe, since I cooked it for an extra few hours and it was a bit thick.

I made this according to instructions, and I must say the smell was HORRID. It smelled of burning honey or plastic. The flavour was decent but it took me so long to air out the kitchen I will not be making this again. My husband also mentioned he thinks the pineapple was "too slimy".

I liked the concept of this recipe. It was simple and smelled delicious. Like others, I used boneless chicken breasts instead and did not brown them before tossing everything into the crock pot. I set it on low for about 4 hours and was going to up it to high if needed. The chicken turned the nice brown color as everyone else has stated, however it was SO dry. I'm not sure what happened. I was really glad I decided to cook it on low, because if it would've sat on high for the time it tells you, it would've been like eating shoe leather and unedible. I'll have to try again, maybe for even less time? Also, after adding the cornstarch, my sauce did not thicken at all. It was a runny mess, so I guess I'll have to tweek that too next time around.

I made this with 8 thighs because we wanted left overs and consider 2 thighs to be a serving. To the recipe I added one large sweet red bell pepper cut into chunks and that was really the only change I made. We had it over white rice and it reminded me of  Chinese restaurant chicken. I cooked it on low for 6 hours  while spending the day doing a bunch of running around and it came out perfect.

MY husband enjoyed more than I did- IT tasted more like a teriyaki-I expected a different flavor-it was masked more by soy sauce i thought.

My family enjoyed this easy meal.  I did change it a bit by using boned chicken thighs (I bought them in error, instead of boneless) and it came out just fine.  I could not find pineapple tidbits and used chunks instead.  Next time, I will cut the chunks into smaller pieces.  I paired with simple fried rice and my family ate it up!

I made this tonight and it's incredible! The chicken is so moist and delicious. Like others, I skipped browning the chicken and used the ginger from my spice rack instead of fresh ginger. I plan on making this again soon.

Just made this a couple nights ago, and it was great!  So easy- and I did cook it in the oven at 325 for about 1 hour 45 minutes.  I took it out, removed the chicken and poured the sauce into a pan in order to keep hot and add the cornstarch and water.  Like other reviewers, I didn't have fresh ginger and used a ground powder.  I know that fresh would have made it even better, and will definitely try next time!  My husband loved it and said it reminded him of general tso's chicken.  Next time I think I will add some veggies, like broccoli and sliced carrots towards the end of cooking, or perhaps in the sauce after removing the chicken.  Delicious AND EASY!!!

I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1 tsp of ginger. I mdidn't really see any extra flavor from the pineapple. I think I will leave it out next time.

I did brown the chicken prior to putting in the pot, does it make a real difference?  Unsure.  The chicken tasted great, I put a bit less honey though.  My boyfriend absolutely loved this dish.

When I made the juicy part of the recipe, I thought it had the perfect punch until I added the forgotten pineapple juice.  The flavor became too watered down--and I did use name-brand pineapple.  I will definitely make it again but omit the pineapple.  Thanks!!

Very easy to make! I did adjust the recipe though based on other reviews. I did not brown the chicken first, I used bone in thighs and left out the ginger and pineapple, also used a little less honey so it wasn't overly sweet. I also wrapped the thighs in a strip of bacon =o) I cooked for 4 hours on high then about 30 minutes while I made my rice and veggies. Could definitely be made with boneless chicken breast as well.

So yummy, thanks for the recipe.  2 days ago I fixed this. I just dumped everything in the crock pot (except pineapple, cornstarch and water) with 10 frozen chicken thighs and 5 hrs. ( 2 hr. high 3hrs. low) later I added pineapple and we had an amazing dinner. I didn't do the corn starch and water until tonight and put the last 2 thighs in the sauce to simmer 'til warm.  Can't wait to try it again and halve the recipe, just hubby and me.

This was absolutely amazing! I don't have my slow cooker so I baked in oven at 325 degrees F for about an hour. This was too long for the amount of chicken I used: 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken tenderloins. So chicken got dried out but it still has terrific flavor.  I also used half the amount of honey. I halved the whole recipe (so I used 1/4 of the amount of the called-for honey in the given recipe). This was SO good! 
I am excited to try in the slow cooker!!! Also, don't be afraid if you don't like ketchup; I don't like ketchup but I used it anyway (halved it like I halved the rest of the recipe) and it turned out great. King of a rich recipe, but really really good!!!

Easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half, and only did three thighs.  I wished I cooked more, my kids were asking for more.  I didn't have pineapple so I used half a can of peaches, and it worked well.  Left out the ginger, cooked it on high for 3  hours and it was perfect.  I added cornstarch and the sauce came out well.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Too sweet! Way too much honey. Might be really good with a lot less sweetness. May try again and cut it in half or less. Otherwise very easy and the thighs are tender and juicy if you don't cook too long.

This is great!  The only change i made was to increase the garlic cloves to 5 and used powdered ginger.  I didn't brown the chicken, just threw everything in the crockpot cooked on high for 3 hours and it was done!  
Great recipe, Tora - thank you!

Made 1 adjustment based on previous reviews.  I reduced honey to 1/2 cup. It had flavor and the chicken was moist but when I asked everyone if it was a keeper the vote was no overall for us.  It was definitely easy to make.

This is amazing! I used this recipe to make a stir fry and it produces the tenderest chicken I've ever had.

Although I must note that I didn't follow directions and just threw all of the ingredients in a slow cooker for a few hours, and it came out fine. Just add stir fry veggies in the last 15 minutes and then pour over rice. Delicious!

I made this dish after church knowing I had a children's birthday party to attend in the afternoon. I was very excited about the recipe. The results were OK. Not a keeper recipe. After 4 hours the chicken was overdone and the sauce had an almost burnt taste to it. It never thickened up with the cornstarch either.

Unfortunately, I followed several reviews, and didn't brown the chicken.  I think it would have been more juicy and tender if I had.   Also, someone recommended adding rice in the slow cooker - I tried that, and after 2 hours on high, the rice hadn't cooked at all - besides the fact that it is essentially cooking in soy sauce and honey, not good.  I would recommend cooking the rice separately.

Maybe I did something wrong but my husband and I both hated this, it's way too sweet and I had a lot more sauce than I needed.  Using boneless breasts instead of thighs was my only substitution,

Should be called "Honey Ginger Chicken". My 4 kids liked the chicken, but not the extra sauce poured over the noodles/rice (made both).  I found the sauce to be slightly to sweet and overpowering, my kids agreed. I could definitly taste the ginger (used fresh ginger). 4 stars = 3 stars for taste, and 1 star for ease.

This was great, I didn't think it tasted anything like the name implied, but it was really good.  It was more like a teriaki chicken to me.  The leftovers worked great over salad, with Mai Fun noodles, Rice obviously.

Very good. I didn't brown my chicken,as it was frozen so I just threw it in the crock pot with some cubed sweet potatoes. I did make the mistake of not starting it soon enough for dinner, so by the time we normally eat it was still completely raw after two hours. So I took it out and put it in a pan on 350* for about half an hour. Very good, we served it over brown rice. The chicken was a little dry but that's because I used breast. Yum!

I couldn't get the sauce to thicken but the flavour was really good. I was craving more of a sticky thick honey garlic sauce but I will make this again since it tasted so good. I served it with rice and sauteed bean sprouts, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and a corn starch, ground ginger, chicken stock sauce coating :D I think next time I will take the sauce and pan fry it to thicken it up and see if that makes it just right. I did not put pineapple anything in it and probably won't because I feared it would make it too much like sweet and sour sauce. Thank you for posting a yummy SLOW COOKER recipe! No can soups. haha!

Used boneless skinless thighs and pretty much followed the recipe without exact measuring.  Everyone loved it.  The sauce isn't too sweet.  Just enough to give the chicken some flavor.  Will definately make again!

This was a little too sweet for us.  I started with frozen breasts, and cook time was perfect.  I also did not have a problem thickening the sauce as I read in a few reviews.  Served ours over pasta.

My first slow cooker recipe didn’t turn out well at all!  I thought that something cooked for 4 hours on high could be cooked for 8 hours on low with similar results, so I cooked this for 8 on low then switched to warm so it would be ready when I got home from work.  It actually burned somewhat!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but now know that fattier, bone-in cuts of meat work better. I filled my huge slower cooker to at least ½ full as recommended, by adding frozen veggies, 1 ½ cups of rice, and enough water to make it the rest of the way to the ½-full mark (didn’t have enough ingredients to fill extra space w/sauce). I found out that rice doesn’t hold up well after 8 hours in the slow cooker; the sauce turned it a brown color and it clumped together giving the appearance of canned dog food (still tasted good, though). The vegetables had lost their original colors and turned to mush. The chicken easily pulled apart with a fork, but was extremely dry. I threw the leftovers away. This recipe is likely a 4 star when made properly and perhaps w/a few slight adjustments. It came out a 2.5 for me, but it was mainly my fault. I'd give it another try.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Very simple and gives the chicken a lovely flavor.  I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks and ended up adding some sauteed diced onion toward the end to balance out all the pineapple bits floating around in my sauce, and I also threw in some sliced carrots to cook with the chicken.  I cooked mine on Low for about 5-1/2 hours, then kicked it up to High for another 1/2 hour to get the carrots finished off.  The only complaint I have, as mentioned by others, was that the sauce doesn't thicken much (you'd probably need to transfer the sauce to a pan and do it on the stovetop at a simmer), but I wasn't overly concerned with it and it wasn't worth losing a star over. ;)  So it's closer to a broth, but still delicious!

I personally liked this, but it was a flop with the family- when I asked how they liked the chicken, one said they thought it was pork and another said they thought it was beef.

OK- if I were to fix this again, I think I would half the soy suace and up the pineapple. In my opinion the soy sauce over powered all other flavors, I even doubled the garlic.

Soooo good! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and it was so yummy! The chicken just fell apart (in a really good way) and the pineapple chunks and sauce was delicious on the rice! Will definitely make again!

Loved it!  I followed it almost exactly: there were a few more thighs in my package, plus I cut off any fatty chunks from the thighs before frying.  I also thickened the sauce on the stove - easy & fast.  Everything was perfect, loved the flavor.  Chicken breasts would be great as well, but thighs are more cost effective :)  This is another keeper!

Interesting recipe! I used bone-in skinless breasts and added some brown sugar and black pepper to the sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hours then on low for 1 hour. The chicken came out very soft but I thought the sauce lacked punch. It was a little bland for me. I was expecting more of a sweet/garlicky teriyaki. Ended up having to add lots more salt than I wanted to just to get some taste into it. But overall this is a good recipe and I would try it again with a lot more garlic, ginger and maybe some hot sauce.

I wanted a recipe that I could put in the crockpot and used ingredients I had on hand. This was it. I substituted chicken breasts for the thighs and didn't bother to sear them first. Even with the cornstarch, the sauce never really got thick. It was tasty but not a real wow. So, after we had this for dinner, I was going to rate this a "3". But we had the leftovers for lunch today and they were so much better. The cooked chicken marinating in the extra sauce for a couple of days really enhanced the flavor so I'm upgrading to a "4".

This was absolutely fantastic, and I'm not a fan of thighs. I didn't have any pineapple on hand so I simply sliced up a lemon and layered it on top. Very good, thankyou for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make and was delicious.  My family of 5 cannot wait to have it again. The only thing I would change is in the instructions to specify that you need a small mixing bowl, not just a small bowl.

My family was not totally wild about this recipe.  It was good, but not outstanding.

The chicken was cooked wonderfully, it just fell apart and was very tender.  It was a little too sweet of a sauce for me but the other 2 adults thought it was perfect.

Awesome, followed the recipe didn't change a thing. It was so juicy and just fell apart and melted in your mouth. Thanks for the great dish.

Made this for my future mother in laws birthday party and everyone loved it!! The only thing I added was I had some left over Jack Daniels Teriyaki Sauce that needed to be used up so I tossed that in and it was fabulous!! I had it the next day with some left over pasta and it was even better the next day!! Great recipe and definitely a keeper!!

The only change I made was that I added a green pepper. The sauce was very tasty; however, it was pretty thin. I think next time I'll move it to a saucepan and bring to a boil. I removed all the skin and fat form the chicken, and it still was a bit greasy. Very tasty though.

absolutely wonderful.  I didnt have any ginger, so I left that out. It was still quite good.  My family loved it. I would definitely make this one again.

This is a great dish! I altered it just a little by reducing the soy sauce to 2/3 cup and adding just a bit more pineapple juice. Other than that, the recipe is great as is. It is so easy, and considering it's healthy as well, this one is a definite keeper! Thank you for submitting it!

I tried this tonight, and it came out pretty great. I didn't use any ketchup (would have made it too tangy, in my opinion)and I used chicken breasts. Other than that, I kept the original recipe (despite a dash of pepper). I did cook for 4 hours, however, next time I make it I think I'll only do 3 because the chicken was just a little dry (but that was ok because of the yummy sauce). Will definitely make this again.

Not a hit at my house - people found it too sweet.  Husband didn't complain (he knows better) but he didn't get up for seconds.  Two 4 year olds weren't impressed.

This was awesome chicken!!  The only change I made was to use crushed pineapple instead of the tid bits, because it was all I had.  I def think it's important to use thighs for this recipe and not sub for breasts.

If you love honey, you'll love this recipe.  I thought the honey flavor was a bit too strong, though.  Overall, a satisfying dinner.  The sauce is great with rice.

Very disappointing.  The chicken turned out tough and dry, and the sauce was cloying.  My wife and kids ate a few bites and wouldn't touch the rest.  I finished mine, but admitted later that the recipe was not a keeper.

My husband thought it was delicious and ate two full servings, however, I wasn't too crazy about it. I guess I was hoping for more of a honey-garlic taste. I cut the chicken into chunks after it was cooked and served it over rice with steamed broccoli. I may try this again without the pineapple juice/chucmks and see what I get.
