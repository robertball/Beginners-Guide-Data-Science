Although the ratings on the Kraft website rated this excellent, I have to wonder if people really tried this recipe. I really didn't care for this, although hubby liked it. To me this just doesn't taste like tiramisu at all. I wouldn't even say a great cheesecake. The required time/temp results in a cracked cheesecake - that is very dry. I will look elsewhere for a better recipe.

I have made this several times exactly as the recipe states and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. This definitely deserves 5 stars!

Excellent and easy! I had reservations about the Nilla Wafer crust, but once the recipe is prepared and served, the wafers are unrecognizable as such.  You would swear they were ladyfingers.  Great portable dessert to make for a crowd.  Very rich, so one cheesecake can feed many people.  I doubled the coffee (I like a strong coffee flavor).    In addition, I sprinkled teeny tiny miniature chocolate chips on top, for added texture.  If you like tiramisu, and you like cheesecake, this is one you should try.

Easy to make and edible but does not taste like taramisu and not particularly flavorful.

I have made this recipe twice. It's very easy to make and looks nice when it's done. Both times my guests loved it!   The second time I used real whip cream instead of cool whip. Next time I will try it in a spring form and see how that goes.
