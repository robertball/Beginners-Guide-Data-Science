Delicious!  I cut the chicken into little hunks and served this with egg noodles.

My fiance thought it was as good as his mom's, and since she's quite an amazing and experienced cook, that means a lot!  We fought over the leftovers.

The family enjoyed this meal, will make again!  I added can of mushroom soup w/half can of milk instead of sour cream adding fresh mushrooms also.(Made a great gravy for noodles).  Had a very pleasant mellow taste!

Super simple & delicious.  Changes I made were (1)increased the amount of broth...I wanted it nice & saucy and didn't think 1/2 c. would do it (2)added extra paprika so it wouldn't be diluted by the extra broth.  I cut up the chicken into chunks & served it all over egg noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is quick and simple enough to make however, both my husband & I thought it was bland.  Dispite the searing of the chicken to seal in juices, before it was cooked for 10 mins. in broth with spices, the chicken turned out tough. I believe it needs to cook longer to tenderize the chicken.

This was absolutely wonderful!  It may be the best chicken we have ever had, and we eat a lot of chicken.  Made it last night for dinner and this morning my husband asked if we can have it again tonight.  He said this is definitely a repeat recipe!

This certainly was not bad by any means.  However, it had a bit of a salty flavor for my tastes, so I would probably cut the salt a bit if I made it again.  I also added the cold sour cream while the sauce was still very hot, so it curdled a bit and didn't end up very creamy - oops!

Use regular paprika, I used a smokey roasted paprika and the first night flavors were a little muddled.  We actually liked the flavor on the second day better after things had sat and blended together.  It has been added to our family favorites list.  Cooking time was about 15 minutes longer than indicated .

Easy & delicious!  A little heavy the 1st time, so I switched to fat free sour cream.  Also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces (the 2nd time around) while still frozen for ease in browning. YUM :)

Directions call for ingredients not listed and ingredients listed not called for in directions.  Very confusing but if you can improvise it turns out o.k.

It might have been good if the ingredients followed the directions! The olive oil and sour cream were never mentioned in the directions, and there was water, yogurt, and margerine in the directions but you don't know how much to use because they weren't on the ingredient list. I had to improvise and it ended up turning out fine.

Very yummy. I sliced the chicken into halves, doubled the broth (fat free), sour cream (also fat free), paprika, and used two onions instead of one. It was tender and saucy, but still could have used more paprika in my opinion.

This was good. there wasnt much sauce so i added a little more broth and served the sour cream seperately.
