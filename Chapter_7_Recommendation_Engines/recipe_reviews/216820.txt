This should be named "Southern Cornbread" I've made cornbread this way for 60 yrs. The only thing that would make it better, if White Lily still made Three Rivers cornmeal. They stopped about two years ago. It is still excellent.  I use a 10" skillet. This is also very good crumbled into a glass of cold milk.

You could use either an 8" or 10" skillet for this recipe.  A variation I like is to make this become "cracklin' cornbread," something my grandmother made.  In the south, you can buy cracklins in the refrigerated meats section of the store.  If that's not available to you, buy a bag of snacking pork rinds and crumble into small bits yielding about 1/4-1/2 cup and mix it in the batter.   If you're a "purist," you can use 1/4 cup Crisco or other "solid" shortening in place of the oil; just cut it into the dry cornmeal until you have small crumble results and then add other ingredients.  This is my favorite kind of cornbread! Goes great with pinto beans, black-eyed peas, turnip or mustard or collard greens, or chili.

This makes a great corn BREAD. If Marie Calendar's is waaaay to sweet this is the one for you. Even if you don't top with honey, jam, preserves, jelly or syrup it's quite good. This is the only one I've come across that doesn't doesn't have sugar and flour.

This recipe is indeed interesting from an historic perspective - possibly a passed-down recipe from an age where leavening and maybe even white flour was hard to get and not always available to the lonely farm-wife.

The density and lack of sugar are not so detracting as the lack of salt or any other flavoring in this recipe.  It reminds me a little of the modern "depression era" bread recipes  that leave out salt as if it were so dear as to be unaffordable... which I doubt was really the case except in the most severely poor homes.

Some other reviews suggest adding sugar or baking powder or all-purpose flour.  That really would change the recipe too dramatically and take away from the simple charm of this "southern" cornbread.

I would suggest adding a teaspoon of salt.  It maintains the spirit of this all-corn southern bread, but makes it palatable.  If you want a slightly fluffier cornbread, meringue the egg by beating vigorously to froth before mixing with other ingredients.  What the poor southern cook might have lacked in ingredients, they could make up with elbow-grease.

I love this! To me, cornbread should never have honey, sugar, or any other sweetener in it - it's corn BREAD, not corn CAKE! :) It should be coarse and savory with a hint of sourness - this fits the bill perfectly! Thanks for sharing this.

I didn't care for this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong that the other reviewers did right, but it tasted so bad.  Bland, gritty, flat...my husband, kids nor I could even eat it!

If you like sweet corn bread or "muffin like" corn bread this is not the corn bread for you.  It has no sugar and no flour.  This is a plain "southern style cornbread".  You can dress it up by adding jalapenos, cheese, or anything else you like.  This is just the Basic recipe.  This is a great cornbread eaten with chili or on the side of most southern meals.  I like it as it is crumbled in a tall glass of milk.

I liked this but its bland.  I'm not used to cornbread with out the sweet but I did enjoy it.  I have been experimenting with pinole, and cant find anything good.  I know this is not pinole but it tastes the same to me but easier to swallow.  This would go great with chili or to compliment some dish.  I love that there is no flour in this recipe.  If you like it sweet then it seems easy enough to just add some sweetener to this recipe.

This is classic southern cornbread and if that is what you are looking for then this is it. Great recipe to make the cornnbread for dressing. But if you are eating it at the table, it does need salt. And you can add a few more flavor enhancers like corn or peppers.  But don't use flour, sugar, or baking powder, just get another recipe for that type of cornbread. Also, I used crisco instead of oil.

This recipe needs to be revised to correct which ingredient amount is wrong.  The cornbread batter was extremely thick, and the cornbread didn't raise and was tasteless and dry.

This was a complete disappointment. It was dry, bland (I even added honey & kosher salt), thick, dense, and tasteless. 
There was no rise to it, and no crumble. Leaving this one off the "make again" list.

I'm not from the south so maybe I'm missing something.  I was trying to avoid sugary corn bread but I think this went too far the other way.  It was flat, dense, bland and mealy.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way but it wasn't to our taste at all.

I had some buttermilk that I needed to use up so I make this recipe.  I served it with chili and it was really good.  Strangely enough, the taste of this cornbread seemed very familiar to me, so someone from my childhood must have made their cornbread the same way.  I’m also looking forward to taking this basic recipe and playing with it a little.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

The review by ' Breadmaker was very informative, and useful,..... however he was wrong , or she was when they mentioned the lack of Salt and the "lonely farm wife" not being too poor to afford salt ... yep , we were in the hills of East Tn. , but we did eat well, with what we had ... Thanks "Breadmaker"!!.

Almost right. Needs baking soda to make it rise, unless you're using self-rising cornmeal. It is southern cornbread, which means no flour, and definitely, definitely no sugar. I added a teaspoon of baking soda from memory, and it turned out fine.

As a recommendation,I think the writer meant to say to use "self rising cornmeal". Otherwise, you will need to add all of the left out ingredients for plain cornmeal.

This was really dense. The flavor was okay though. I'll probably try a recipe with flour next time because I would have liked something that's fluffier.

I used a fine cornmeal and the bread came out delicious as a side for chili, very dense and crispy edges with the butter. After reading the reviews I did add a teaspoon of salt and a heaping spoonful of honey.

As long as I can remember, 50+ years, the women and men in my family have used this recipe.  My husband likes olive oil.  You can use it instead of the oil and butter.  Works just the same.  By the way, if you heat the skillet on the stove top you can sprinkle in some extra cornmeal, wait until it starts to get dark brown, then pour in the batter.  The hotter the skillet the darker the crust!!!  Gives that glass of sweet milk and cornbread just a little something extra.

I loved the flavor and texture but it did not rise for me.  I am wondering if it needed baking powder or something.

It is a great cornbread. I prolly will not make it again. It is too dense for my tastes. However it is a lot closer to the way my grandma made cornbread then I have found other places. I was more looking for an airy cornbread this deff was not it.

I've made this recipe several times and have never had any problem with it rising or anything.  I follow the recipe exactly and have never had any problems that other reviewers have had.  I wonder if it varies depending on the cornmeal?  It is a great basic cornbread recipe.  I like to add some peppers and cheese to mine.

This was really bad and I was trying to make real Southern corn bread for my husband who's from Kentucky. It was really dense & a strange consistency in the middle. The only good part was the buttery crust. I do NOT recommend this recipe. I actually have a great recipe for non-sweet corn bread but this is too dense in the middle.

I made this recipe because it seemed so simple. Apparently too simple. I made my own buttermilk and the whole thing came out tasting like vinegar. I even added some sugar before baking because i noticed that it seemed too bitter. also there's nothing to make it rise. I won't be able to serve this for dinner tonight. wouldn't recommend.

I've made this yesterday and i liked it; i was looking for an easy recipe with few ingredients but i was specially looking for a very traditional recipe and this is it...

This is actually the first time i make a corn bread and i was doubting which recipe to make as i am not very experienced with baking bread, but as i was making oven-baked fried chicken and coleslaw, i wanted to have some corn bread as well and this one fitted perfectly and i know that i will make it again, thank you for sharing it :). Greetings.

This is an excellent corn bread recipe!  It is classic southern style and very easy to make.  The only change I made was to add in a dash of salt.  I will definitely be making this many times in the future.

When I followed this recipe, my bread turned out really flat and dense.  I didn't have a cast-iron skillet, so I used a regular round cake pan instead (I put it in the oven while it was preheating).  I wonder if the bread didn't rise because a bread pan won't heat up as high as a cast-iron skillet.  I've seen a friend make corn bread with a cast-iron skillet and it worked like a charm (it seemed to rise right after she poured in the batter and before she returned it to the oven).  Has anyone gotten the flat, dense results even though they used the cast-iron skillet?

The ingedient list is similar to my moms recipe, but mine didn't turn out, it was totally flat, maybe my pan was too big. What size skillet do you use for this recipe?

I did not care for this recipe. It is not a bread and does not turn out like the fluffy cornbread in the photo. I thought it was strange that no baking powder or baking soda was needed, and sure enough, the thing did not rise at all. I got a very dense, dry, tough slab of packed cornmeal that should be soaked and dissolved in something else to make it eat-able. I don't know what to do with it now!  Next time I'll stick with the recipes that have baking powder/soda in the ingredients.

This emerged from the oven as a thick, baked polenta. Call it bread if you like, but it isn't. I won't make this again.

This was very gritty, bland, and just very disappointing. I ran out of flour with my Christmas baking and was excited to find a recipe without flour, as I was looking forward to cornbread with my chili and none was open on Christmas for me to purchase flour. This was one of the worst things I have ever had. If you are looking for cornbread, I do not recommend this recipe.

I made this cornbread as directed adding cornmeal to the melting butter in cast-iron skillet on stove top.  It was the best cornbread I have eaten in years.  It was perfect.  Thank you, nothing extra was needed.

Terrible.  There is no salt or leavening in the recipe, which yields a dry, dense, and bland "cornslab" (can't really call it "bread.")  I should have known, just looking at the recipe that it would be bad, but there were so many good reviews that I must have thought it was a "magic" recipe.  Oh, and I was specifically looking for a no-sugar, no flour cornbread, so it's not a case of I didn't know what I was getting into.

I have not made this recipe yet but I noticed that a lot of people said that it did not work. I am wondering if you made it with plain cornmeal or did you use cornmeal mix which already has salt and flour in it.  I think that is the problem.  Its like the difference between plan and self rising flour.  Cornmeal is plain cornmeal mix is self rising.

I added a tbsp of sugar...not enough to make it sweet, just yummy. I have always liked cornbread made with buttermilk, a influence of southern living. What I think this recipe is lacking is a rising agent and salt or self-rising cornmeal. The taste, however, was good.

The only thing I didnt like was the bland flavor. But I used skim milk b/c that was what I had to make the buttermilk. So not having actual buttermilk I am sure was part of it. But next time I will add a little salt. Made this to go with pinto beans. We slathered it with real butter as we had planned to anyway. My boys liked it with the butter.

Very good but I find the recipe given here a little dry. I added a little more buttermilk. If you put more  butter in the skillet, you can add the extra amount to the batter after swirling it around the skillet. It adds a nice touch.

I was surprised to see this on here, as many cooks don't like plain cornbread. This recipe is exactly how my mother taught me to make cornbread, with the added exception of salt to taste. For a real treat, crumble it up in buttermilk. Yum!

This was okay.  Since I don't own a cast-iron skillet, I melted the butter and then made the cornbread in a Corning-ware glass dish, which worked out well, but required a bit more time to bake.  I added a bit of salt, brown sugar, and baking soda, after reading the other reviews.  We ate it for breakfast with maple syrup and low-fat cottage cheese.  It was delicious that way, although quite crumbly.  I might make it again.

Southern cornbread does not need sugar.  The only way to improve this recipe would be to have fresh ground cornmeal.

Great recipe! I added 1 teaspoon of self rising flour and 1/4 cup of sugar for a little sweetness.

I agree with shuyett, very bland and gritty and I used a cast iron skillet.

Bland.  I didn't pay much attention to the fact that there was no salt or baking powder when I decided to make this recipe (I was just quickly searching for an easy cornbread recipe for dinner--and most of the dinner was already ready, so I was kind of in a hurry). 

I did stray from the recipe in that I did not do the butter in the skillet thing...I greased an 8x8 pan instead.  Turned out pretty dense and flat with not much flavor.  I also used instant buttermilk, which might have made a difference in flavor as well (but hasn't in other recipes).  So, take it for what it's worth.  Probably a good recipe if you follow it exactly and don't care that it isn't salty at all.

I think I'm tainted by the deliciousness of Famous Dave's cornbread muffins (which are probably full of sugar and lard, for one thing...).  I wouldn't make this again.

I think you got cornmeal mixed up with cornbread mix.  I usually add a bit of salt, a bit of baking powder and a bit of flour to mine.  I wanted to try a recipe with buttermilk because I usually use sweet milk and I am sorry that this is the one I tried.  It was horrible.  Sorry :/
