I made muffins with chocolate chips in them (only had milk chocolate) with no zest, and they turned out very nice.  A keeper.

I have never had much success with baking, but I thought I would give this recipe a try. Yeah! I served it to family at a mother's day brunch and everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was one of three quick breads I made for a family gathering, and it was the least popular.  We were not thrilled with either the texture or the flavor, so I will not make the recipe again.

Normally the first time I try a recipe I following it exactly, but I just couldn't justify so much butter in a single loaf.  I used 4T butter and 1/4c lite salad dressing, 3/4c sugar, and 1/2c egg substitute with 1/2c mini semi-chips.  It had rich orange -bittersweet choc flavor and dense moist texture.  In fact my boyfriend insisted I leave it here for him instead of bringing in to share at work
