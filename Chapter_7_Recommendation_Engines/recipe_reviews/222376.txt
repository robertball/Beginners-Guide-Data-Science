I think it was good but also pretty runny. The pecans taste bad with it.

Found it to be very runny and even with the added powered sugar not very tasty.

I chose to add just a little powdered sugar and serve them open faced topped with a strawberry sliver. A perfect addition for my tea party!

A pretty simple basic recipe.  I think depending on the strawberries, a little sugar could be added to the mixture.  This would also make a good dip for fruit.
