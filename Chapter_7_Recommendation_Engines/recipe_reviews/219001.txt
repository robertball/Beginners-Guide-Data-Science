OMG -- OUTSTANDING!! I took a Short Cut @ the 3rd time I made it and I use 'Italian' Seasoning now. 1/2 Cup of Olive Oil, 1 Heaping TBSP of Minced Garlic, 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning, Salt & Pepper. I use it on homemade Breads, Rolls and found a wonderful discovery -- I marinade my Veggies in it then skewer it up for the BBQ. My Husband doesn't really like Veggies but requests these OFTEN!! Love that!! Our Grown Up Son & Daughter loved them too :)

Tastes wonderful and was very easy to make.  It tastes just like our favorite Italian restaurant's and was just what I was looking for to dip my home-baked herb bread into.

I used Italian seasoning, a robust olive oil and didnâ€™t heat it! It was great!
