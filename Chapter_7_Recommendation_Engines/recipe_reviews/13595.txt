Very good. Fist time making I thought the prep directions were more than needed to do. So the second time I made it, I dissolved the jello in the hot water, added the cream cheese and beat with mixer. Added the pineapple with juice, and 1/2 cup pecan pieces. Then I folded in the whipped whipping cream. This way it was more simple to prepare and came out great!

Took this to a Christmas get together on my hubby's side & it was a complete hit! Mother in law even asked for recipe as well as 2 others. We served it with the meal, and some chose it for dessert too, (over pumpkin pie). My grandma makes a variation of this with marshmallows, but I prefer this recipe. I recommend it setting overnight for the flavors to blend.

This is a wonderful salad. I made it for the family Christmas buffet and added a layer of red jello to the top for a festive look. It will be a new family tradition.

I've been searching all my cookbooks for this recipe - my grandmother always made this for holiday meals, and I'm so happy to have found it!  I found that the gelatin sets up too firmly if left for an hour - 1/2 hour is adequate.  Also, I used only a little more than half of the whipping cream and it turned out fine.  Molds beautifully!

This has been a tradition at our holiday for years. We leave out the pecans, don't heat the pineapple (our recipe didn't call for that) and sometimes don't whip the cream when short on time. Still turns out great! Oh and an immersion hand blender works beautifully when the jello sets up a little faster than you expected.
 My husband doesn't like pineapple, so I made him a cherry version. Subbed two 4 oz. boxes of sugar-free black cherry jello, upped the boiling water to 1-1/2 c. and added chopped fresh bing cherries. Yum! Could even add chopped almonds to compliment the cherries. Next? Strawberry-banana walnut? The possibilities are up to you!

When I first made this recipe, I taste-tested it before wanting to serve it with Thanksgiving dinner.  When I came to my senses, I realized that I had taste-tested 1/3 of the bowl!  Wonderful stuff.

Very delicious!  Although, I would put a small amount aside without nuts for kids.  Lots of kids hate nuts.  Oh, and if you double this recipe be prepared for a lot!!  Chris

Delicious!! I make this every year during the holidays... friends & family always say "oh noooo, not that green thing again," but it's always the first dish to be finished! I add walnuts instead of pecans. 
Be sure to boil the crushed pineapple! One year I tried to throw in the pineapple without heating it on the saucepan as directed, and the gelatin never solidified. 
This is a great  side dish and a big hit at every party gathering

I just took this to a potluck today.  My 10-yr old daughter made it and we weren't able to bring any of it home!  She elected to not include the nuts.  I wouldn't have minded the nuts, but who am I to disagree with a cook-in-the-making?!

Just like the other reviewer, we found that it needed only one-half hour to set.  We previously tried an hour and it was too hard so the kids got some jello jigglers instead from that batch.  We had trouble dissolving the gelatin, but it really didn't matter much once it was blended with the cream cheese.  The best part of this recipe is the combination with REAL whipped cream instead of the typical Cool Whip. It will definitely be added to our favorite jello salad recipes.  Thanks for posting! 

Next time I will try using orange gelatin because I also love the orange/pineapple combination, too.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Making it again for Christmas. It's so light and fluffy with a great texture.  If you want to give a little kick add 1/2 teaspoon of Horseradish.  Sounds crazy but it gives it a little zip.  I have made it with and without and they are both great! Thank you for the recipe.

Made several salads for potluck, took this one--knew it would go over well (make night before for flavors to blend and to set). What can you say bad about a jello salad that looks as pretty as this one! The refreshing lime green color just makes your mouth water. This is an old tried but true recipe thats been around for years and the reason is --- it's goooood! I'll be making this for years to come, it's easy and can be served with the meal or as a dessert.

This was good, but not as flavorful as it sounds. I could hardly taste the cream cheese...but you can't hardly go wrong with cranberry, cream cheese, pineapple, and nuts all in one dish.

I have loved this recipe since I was 3 yrs old (so 42 yrs.)  As an adult I call it "Big Spoon Salad" because I'll keep returning to the fridge with a big spoon (tablespoon ) and get a spoonful at a time.

I was not impressed with this salad. Sorry. I guess I was expecting something more.  I added one package of instant vanilla pudding and that seemed to improve the flavor.

Thank you for this recipe.  My Aunt used to make this for every family gathering when I was young.  Until now no one in the family could remember how to make it.  It it now a staple at all family gatherings.

As written, it was a little problematic... One hour in my fridge and the thick jello had already set up. Next time I will do 1 c. of cold liquid (juice/water) in addition to the 1 c. boiling water, and only chill for 45 minutes. Added marshmallows, as is common in this kind of salad.

Simple and delicious.  I've made this recipe several times and gotten compliments each time.  I sometimes add a bit of sweetened coconut to mine. Also, I save time by chilling it a few mins in the freezer before moving it to the fridge. Just be careful not to let it freeze.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe; fifteen people still managed to eat the whole thing!!!!  The only complaint that I got was that there were too many pecans.  Next time, I will cut in half.

I remember making a very similar lime jello “salad” in the ‘70’s & ‘80’s. Jello molds were very big back then. No decent party or celebration was without them! Lol! I got the recipe from a friend  after eating it at her house.  I remember She used Cool Whip but I converted it to real whipped cream. She always made hers with a mashed banana folded in too. It was pretty simple compared to a lot of the jello molds back then. A couple packages lime jello dissolved as directed on package (but with less liquid), a can of drained crushed pineapple, cream cheese, mashed banana, whipped cream and chopped pecans.  I remember letting the cream cheese come to room temperature and folding it into the whipped cream and then folding  that, the banana, pineapple and nuts into the lime Jell-O.. Never cooked or reduced anything just mixed it all together in a big bowl, then dumped into a pretty jello mold. Simple and good. Not something we make any more. Guess we’ve gotten too “Foodie”.  Sometimes I miss the simplicity of the old days.

I added 1 cup of fresh shredded coconut. Whipped Philadelphia cream cheese instead of the block. Strauss whole whipping cream from Whole Foods. Put it in a mold. We have several Diabetics so substituted Splenda - 1/2 the amount specified.  Let is set overnight.  Was a HUGE hit. People went back for thirds! Glad I read that fresh Pineapple would prevent it from setting. The crushed Dole canned was fine. Thanks for the recipe.  Passed it on!

I have now made this recipe two times.
When the recipe calls 2 cups heavy whippping cream, I confused about if it meant 2 cups whipping prior to being whipped up or after being whipped. 
The first time I made it with 2 half pint cartons of whipping cream.  The second time I made it with just one carton.  I thought it served more people with the 2 cartons of whipping cream, but thought it tasted sweeter when I only added 1 carton.  I also chose to omit nuts due to offending many people.  When I made it for the first time, I had an immediate request for the next gathering to make this exact jello, so it is tasty and popular.

I lightened this recipe up by subbing 2 pkgs SF lime jello, FF cool whip, and reduced fat cream cheese (and only used 6 oz.)  I didn't understand why you needed to boil the pineapple in it's juice, so I omitted that step.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, because that's what I had on hand.  I've made similar salads like this in the past, they are delicious, but more of a dessert than a salad.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I'm currently on a quest to discover those  old fashioned American holiday dishes esp from the 50s and 60s  'When Cool Whip was a food group. "

This was pretty easy to make,  I left out the nuts. I' ll make it again.

I used 2 boxes of Lime jello.  Also used softened vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream.  I didnt heat pineapple nor did I drain it.  Also didnt add nuts.  I do put it in a crystal bowl, garnish with whipped cream rosettes, an cherries.
My grandmother made this for years this way and because my mom didnt like pineapple, grandma would make it with fruit cocktail for her.

I have been making this salad for over 55 years  --  but we have always included small chopped pieces of celery  --  try it with celery - just perfect to us. At Christmas always decorate with maraschino cherries  -- now going to try as suggested red jello on top  -- t1hank you for recipe  -- lost my original written recipe.  Oh, I forgot to mention  -- have never heated pineapple - just dump whole can crushed pineapple into partially set jello with celery and chopped walnuts. Let set in refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes then fold in whipped cream.  Have also used 1 small lemon jello with 1 small lime jello and sometimes small curd cottage cheese  --  especially good in summer with the cottage cheese.

Used  frozen thawed whipped topping instead of whipping heavy cream 16oz may be too much of whipped topping- So far I have only sampled before letting it set for a few hours so cannot really tell.
Also used key lime  pecans as festive topping on top.These were green and premade at store. 
I used sugar free lime because I am diabetic and wanted to eat some although still sugar from pineapple and key lime pecans.

This came together exactly as the recipe said it would! I was so pleased, as I had never had much luck adding fruit to Jello in the past. It's yummy with a dollop of whipped cream or mayo. Or just by itself. Very light and refreshing. Will make again.

My Grandma used to make this during the holidays.  I found three different hand written recipes of my grandma's and each recipe was  a little different.  She listed all the ingredients, but not the instructions.  I made this recipe the night before Thanksgiving and I think it was the closest to my grandma's.  It turned out great!

I was looking for recipes that were popular in the 70's for my disco/70's party, and remembered this lime jello salad! Mmmm!  It was a delicious trip in the time machine, and everyone at my party raved about it. It is one of the dishes I remember always having at big dinners when I was growing up, and it didn't disappoint. Several friends say they still have it every Thanksgiving. I may need to revive that tradition!

I grew up having this great tasting jello salad at our holiday meals. As an adult I continued the tradition for my own holiday dinners. My kids look forward to it. I have a "thing" going with one of my sons where when I make it I put a serving in a bowl for him to have earlier in the day. He looks forward to that "special treatment".

I had lost the recipe for my grand mom's green stuff (a staple of every holiday during my childhood). This has too much cream and over powers all the other flavors. 1 cup of cream is plenty. Add a second cup of hot water to make up for using less cream. I think pecans would be good.

I was looking for something similar to my grandma's orange jello salad and this was a great substitute. I think I like the lime even better! I doubled the recipe but kept the cream the same and it turned out great. I love pineapple, but a whole can is a bit overwhelming and too chunky. I'll cut the pineapple in half next time.

Made this for a family cookout lats night and everyone LOVED it. I read the negative reviews for this, and disagree. I did everything exactly as the recipe called for, though I'm not sure what not heating the pineapples would do to it. We all liked it a lot :)

Great recipe. I made a few changes for people watching their carbs. I used sugar free Jello, used half the amount of pineapple and juice (made up the liquid in water -- it was still plenty sweet. Used walnuts because that's the kind of nuts I had. We loved it, and it was very pretty.

This is a perfect recipe for Homestuckers looking for a good Sopor Slime recipe! And this is someone who literally spent months looking for a good sopor recipe that gave the opaque-ness and color of sopor in the comic and still tasted good. 

When I first tried it I didn't have any lime (only lemon) jello and no whipping cream. Even then, it turned out great with a little bit of improvised coffee creamer and milk!

My second attempt was with Green Apple Jolly Rancher jello. The flavor of the pineapple juice (I didn't add the pecans or  the solid pineapples to keep the aesthetic, I also added a bit of green food coloring) combined with the green apple jello is very unique and a perfect mix!

Next time I plan on making it in a pre-crusted pie tin for Sopor Pie and maybe also use some sort of mold to make them into little snackables.
