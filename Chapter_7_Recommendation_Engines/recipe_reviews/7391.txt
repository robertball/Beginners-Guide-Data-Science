Easy to make and delicious. Very chocolatey and not too sweet. I put all the ingredients together in a glass bowl and microwaved it 15 seconds, stirred, then microwaved another 15 seconds, then stirred until blended and smooth. Perfect! (1000 watt microwave, your mileage may vary)

Perfect to top my chocolate cake--thick, glossy and chocolatey. This couldn't be easier or quicker.  Just melt, pour and spread! Hubby's only criticism, and I have to agree, is that there wasn't nearly enough of it on the cake.  Unless you're just using this to drizzle over the cake, you MUST double this!

This was excellent!  I had to substitute honey for the corn syrup, and it turned out great.  Made an excellent topping for eclairs.  Held up well in the fridge.  Great consistency, super quick, and easy!

Not what I was looking for- tasted like melted chocolate chips (of course that is yummy, but I wanted something different).  It also kind of separated out and looked wierd and rubber-like on my cake.  It didn't run down the sides either.  I prefer Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  The recipes are similar, but that one works really well for me.

A bit disappointed- I poured it over a bundt cake, and expected it to run down the sides, but it wasn't thin enough. Too gloopy. I used the microwave method- I suppose I should have nuked the butter and corn syrup as well, instead of mixing in after.

A good recipe.  I added some vanilla extract too.
It set up well, and stayed nice and shiny.

this glaze was so fast and easy, not to mention delicious.  I've also made this glaze with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips.

Excellent easy and delicious recipe for Chocolate Glaze - followed recipe exactly except doubled it.  Made in microwave.  For white design, I melted 1/4 cup of white chocolate morsels and 1 teaspoon of shortening together, drizzled in circles on top of cake and then took a tip of a knife and drew lines through.  Fun recipe!

I made this twice (double batch both times) and I discovered the sequence of events that make this like a glaze, or make it thick. Frankly, I liked the way it turned out in the thick version for frosting the top of a single layer cake (the garbonzo bean choc cake which is better than it sounds.) For a glaze, microwave the chips and syrup together until melted. Then add all the butter and stir like crazy. For a thick fudgy frosting, melt the chips, then add the corn syrup and stir. It will seem too thick. Then add the butter about a teaspoon at a time until you get the consistency you want. It's tasty either way.

This was the perfect glaze for my chocolate chip muffins.  After I bake the muffins and let them cool, I dip the tops into the glaze and then store them in the fridge.  The glaze sets up beautifully.

Perfect for what I was looking for which was a nice chocolately glaze to drizzle over my chocolate cake. Chocolate chips melted nicly and I had a nice consistency. Very thick, glossy and just enough for what I needed. This only makes enough to drizzle over a cake but you will need to double up on the ingredients to cover an entire cake. I used this to drizzle over, "Too Much Chocolate Cake," also from this website

Used on chocolate Lovers Cake.  Needed to make a double batch as this makes very little.  Would have been better if it was a little thinner.

I thought it was amazing!!! I would recommend putting some milk and extra powdered sugar in it, I would also recommend putting milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I'm with the "melted chocolate chips" group.  It really isn't a glaze.  Too thick & even after thinning w more corn syrup, it didn't improve.  'Taking this one out - & satiny chocolate glaze.  It's very similar.

This is not a recipe I would make again.  I prefer a thinner glaze with more flavor.  I agree with others that it was too thick and it tasted like melted chocolate chips.

I used this to ice the top of the Brownie Chocolate chip Cheesecake by Eagle brand on this site.  I used an extra 1/2 tablespoon of corn syrup and I also did it in the microwave as others suggested. It came out beautiful!  Looks like it came from a gourmet bakery!

The glaze had a nice consistency and tasted great. I used it with the Chocolate lovers bundt cake and it didn't overwhelm the cake or make it too sweet.

Perfect chocolate glaze for the bundt cake I made. It hardens nicely and has a nice flavor. Just make sure to use your favorite chocolate bar or chocolate chip brand. It doesn't have to be semi-sweet like the recipe calls for, regular chocolate will be sweeter, but not by much, but will taste more to your preference!

I would say this is more like a thin frosting than a glaze. It has great flavor but not the consistency I was looking for in a glaze. This recipe does have potential to be fabulous, but as written is not a 5 star recipe due to texture and consistency.

I haven't tasted it yet, still waiting for the guest of honor to cut into it. The glaze looked grainy, even though the chocolate chips were thoroughly melted.

absolutely perfect for what I was doing. I made a dense Devil's food cake and I thought I had after I drizzled it over the cake. It's almost like hot fudge and it would be REALLY good over cake and icecream.

I have used this glaze recipe several times and it always comes out perfect. (I use the double-boiler method.) 

Yes, it is thicker than many glazes.  I use a ladle and lightly push the glaze so that it oozes nicely down the sides.  It usually stops midway, staying thick the entire time -- a nice effect.  Yesterday I made four bundt cakes for a church affair and the glaze recipe quadrupled was just as good as for one cake.

Was a little too bitter for me when I followed the recipe, so I added about 1/8 of a cup of powdered sugar and it tasted perfect.

this was ... okay.  maybe i'm just not a glaze fan and i didn't realize it, but this didn't really do much for me.  it did harden up very nicely, but flavor-wise it was just "eh, okay." i put it on lisa's chocolate cake (which is AWESOME) and definitely felt the cake could've stood on it's own (no glaze) and tasted just as good.

Not quite what I expected -- I thought a glaze would be much thinner. However, it tastes great and is more like a frosting than a glaze, and it hardens nicely.

I doubled the recipe to frost the rainbow cookies I made. (recipe by Penney from this site). I made the layers of cookie Mardi Gras colors( purple,green,& yellow) used the frosty recipe from this site for glaze between layers instead of jam and topped with this wonderful chocolate glaze. It worked wonderful and tasted great!!!Thanks jennifer, will use again for cakes also!!

Super easy and quick, I use honey instead of corn syrup. It's more like a donut glaze, but I like a thin frosting so it has worked great for me on cakes.

Super easy to make! I used this to put a glaze on a chocolate zucchini cake from this website. I used the microwave method, put everything in the micro, stirred at 15 seconds, then another 15 seconds. It was complete and gosh that was easy. :)

Very easy to put together I added some vanilla extract and substituted honey for the corn syrup.  I put everything in a microwave bowl and melted it then added the vanilla extract.

I made custard doughnuts (using as a base the Crispy and Creamy Doughnut recipe from this site - beyond!) and needed a rich chocolate glaze that would stay on the doughnuts. This glaze delivered - great taste, great consistency, great appearance.

I made this for a 9x13, and it just barely made enough. I didn't make any changes. Although it was tasty, the texture was a bit grainy (and I made it in a double boiler). I would make it in a pinch if something needed chocolate glaze, but it won't make it in to my "keep" recipes.

Simple and perfect! I used this to top the Mexican Brownies recipe from this site, which wasn't quite sweet enough for my taste, and this was just the right amount of glaze. It tasted great and set up nicely on top of the brownies.

Tasted good but I put my Boston Cream Pie in the fridge and the chocolate glaze got hard as a rock. If you chill your desert take it out of the fridge early to soften up the glaze.

I love this recipe! I always drizzle it on top of my ice creams! I also drizzled it on top of chocolate covered blueberries from this site - but I used white chocolate chips for the drizzle. I usually double, or even triple the recipe.

I'm with Lanie23 and What A Dish!  I was in a pinch and made this - yeah, there are so many better glazes on this site.  IE: Shiny Chocolate Glaze / Satiny Glaze / etc.  Texturally, this is more of a FROSTING or ICING instead of a GLAZE.  It did the job, but I prefer something with more OOMPH!

Very good glaze.  I used milk chocolate chips though.  I used to glaze "Puggie Woogie"  from this web site.

This had a good taste, so the 4 star; however, I am looking for a glaze that is thin and will harden on the cake. This one was rather thick and didn't harden.

Good consistency.  I drizzled this over the Double Chocolate Brownie bundt cake.  Great combination!

This is the quickest and easiest glaze I have ever made.  The flavor was great.  I used it on a family chocolate pound cake recipe.

I used this glaze on the Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake.  The glaze was good but I didn't need to add it to an already sweet chocolate cake.

This was a very yummy glaze that went very well wtih my chocolate marble bundt cake. It was easy and fast. I did double the recipe and found that to be enough. This recipe is chocolatey, not sugary.
