Good cookies and very pretty, but the glaze was difficult to get to the correct consistency. I added almost double the powdered sugar to prevent it from flooding right over the cookie edge. Also, adding a drop of green food coloring to the glaze makes the cookies much more picturesque.

I really enjoyed these cookies.  They were indeed very tasty.  I have made them as lime cokoies, but also made a lemon icing, and used lemon/lime peel in the dough for an extra kick.  When my husband was deployed to the desert, I sent him these, they traveled great!  It took about two weeks to reach him, but they maintained their chewy softness.  And the men LOVED them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy, but I expected the lime to be stronger. They tasted like regular sugar cookies to me. I added a few drops of green food coloring to the dough as well, and used Christmas tree cookie cutters. You definitely have to add more powdered sugar or the glaze will be too runny to spread. A tasty treat, thanks!

You could not really taste the lime-I even doubled it, then added a splash of lemon, still couldn't taste it very well. I even tried a whole different recipe for the middle, using butter/powdered sugar/milk/lime. I don't think the cookie & the icing worked together at all. Plus, it makes a TON of cookies-I had 2 FULL gallon size ziploc bags of cookies when done. I only iced & put together about 1/3 & am stuck w/the rest of the cookies.
