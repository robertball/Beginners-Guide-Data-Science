Fall off the bone indeed. While these will never replace ribs done on a smoker, that is also a weekend thing and very time consuming. These are PERFECT for a week night meal. They may take an hour to finish but only 5 minutes of that is of your actual time. The rest is fuss free. Excellent recipe!

I loved my ribs.  Delicious. fall of the bone tender and melted in my mouth.  I didn't have the liquid smoke  so I added smoked BBQ in the pot, I also didn't have the apple cider vinegar so used red wine! Next time I make this (and I will) I will get the ingredient's that this recipe called for.  Big thank you for sharing this recipe.
