Great way to get in the veggies and husband approved, which is a real feat!  I had about a 2" thick piece of zucchini.  Cut it into 3 inch sections, and then cut each "tube" into 6 spears.  I used Panko crumbs and Parmesan, added garlic, salt, Italian seasoning and lemon pepper.  Baked them for 25 minutes on a pizza stone, no spray.  Delicious!  Thank you for submitting.

Light and Crispy! Such a great crunch! Will definitely make again! I rolled them in seasoned flour, then dipped in egg, and finished in a combo of panko and parm. I put them in the pan and sprayed them with Pam. Sooo yummy!

As is this is kind of bland and 3 stars. I made a batch of them with a packet of dry ranch seasoning mixed into the bread crumbs and parm, much better that way nice and crunchy with a good flavor. With seasoning I'd give it 5 stars, dunk these in ranch for a tasty appetizer or side dish.

So good! Made them to go with turkey sloppy joes. They came out crispy on the outside & soft on the inside, perfectly cooked. :) Can't wait to make them again. The wonderful thing about this recipe is the simplicity of it and the fun you can have adding different spices & seasonings. I added garlic powder, a little cumin, onion powder, salt, & pepper, all to my liking. Next time I think I'll add a little cayenne. (I always end up adding my own take on recipes, but it takes a great base recipe to start!)

I made my own bread crumbs from old bread in the food processor.  It's very easy to make fresh breadcrumbs this way.  I placed the bread crumbs in a large baking dish, and mixed it with Parmesan cheese blend, lemon pepper, garlic powder and white pepper. A bit of clean up with three different pans so not something I made very often, but enjoy it everytime I do

I made a mistake while prepping this recipe. BUT if you want to try it with the zucchini thinly sliced, it works well too!  I recently bought a mandolin and was excited to use it. I thinly sliced all the zucchini lengthwise before realizing that was not what I was supposed to do. Committed, I followed the rest of the recipe as is, (however I did add some herb and spices to the breadcrumbs) and these turned out excellent! Crispy and yummy! Will be making this regularly.

I thought these would be soggy and just okay at best. But wow! Crispy. Tasty. Easy. We have enjoyed fried zuchnni at restaurants...this is maybe even better tasting. I'm back today to make more. Great recipe and cooking method.

I added dried Italian spices to the breadcrumb/panko mixture and dredged in flour.  More importantly you can dredge in flour and do the breadcrumb coating in two separate large ziplock bags to which you add the zucchini which saves dishes and you just toss the bags for a thorough coating which is must quicker.  They do need to be eaten right away as they get soggy eventually

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crunched up saltines and added some Mrs. Dash in the parmesan mixture, too. Excellent!

I rolled the zucchini in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs.  This made it stick a lot better.

Being someone who wants to like zucchini this was perfect - it added some much needed texture to the zucchini I needed to use up in my fridge! Sometimes zucchini can be so slimy, this is the perfect way to counteract that. I found I only needed one egg, and also I thought it seemed to coat the strips better to place the zucchini in the bowl of breadcrumbs then scoop the crumbs over the zucchini, rather than rolling it.

We loved these!  Making them again tonight.  I used Panko Bread Crumbs, added a packet of dry ranch dip mix, and I did not turn the zucchini.  I placed them peel side down and cooked them 20 minutes and they were so good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  We ate them with homemade ranch dressing.... Yum!

Pretty good, but the zucchini didn't get very well cooked, had a bit of a 'green' taste.

The reason I only gave it 4 stars it because it is a little bland if you don't add any seasoning. To fix this I added adobo, garlic powder, basil, a pinch of salt, and Italian seasoning. They cam out great! Will be making these again!

Great veggie side dish, and easy cleanup. I added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder to bread crumb mixture for a bit of additional flavoring.

1 out of 3 people liked it. I added garlic salt as one reviewer suggested.  The dish does not have much flavor and what flavor it did have was not appetizing to 2 of us. But 1 person liked it.

I liked them very much, I enjoyed them dipped in a ranch dressing. I did give four stars as I felt as long as you dip them into a nice dip or dressing the flavor would be fine. However, I decided to add some garlic powder, Italian seasoning to the dry mix, salt and paprika. After eating them I found I liked the thinner cuts as they were crispier. Next time I will make them all thinner cuts.

These are awesome in an airfryer. 400F and 12 minutes, check/turn at 6 minutes. Don't pack too tightly, and make sure you spray the basket with a non-stick spray.

I made these tonight, I floured the zucchini first, then egg, my breading was a mix of panko, parmesan cheese, packet of ranch  dressing mix, granulated garlic, and black pepper.  We enjoyed them!

I was shocked at how well these came out...I used 3 medium zucchini and next time, I will cut them more like "fast food fries"as opposed to the steak fry size.  I couldn't find my Italian seasoning, so I subbed a slightly sweet/moderately spicy all purpose seasoning (kind of like the kind for sweet potato fries).  I too added garlic powder - next time I may try minced garlic instead.  I will also use seasoned Panko next time.  I did not use foil on the baking pan, just placed directly on as I was concerned the fries would stick too much to the foil.  Made clean up a little longer but well worth it.  Although we don't eat "regular" fries often, everyone said they'd prefer these again!
Even my husband who doesn't care for veggies ate them.

Love this recipe!  I only needed one large egg (beaten) for 3 zucchini, but more bread crumbs (about 3/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs.)  I added about a tablespoon of seasoning (Penzey's Fox Point) along with the grated cheese and sprayed the zucchini with canola oil cooking spray before baking.  I used non-stick foil. I will definitely make this again!

This is a 5 star recipe with additions/changes.  As another reviewer suggested I used panko, Parmesan, garlic salt, Italian seasoning and lemon pepper.  Baked on a pizza stone (no spray) for 25min, turning over at the 12min mark.  Turned out fantastic!! Ty for the "base" recipe.

They just didn't have much taste, my boyfriend drowned them in salt saying they didn't taste like much and asked if there was some seasoning that I might have left out. I agree there should have been something in the egg mixture. Ill jazz it up next time and maybe I won't have to feed it to the dog sorry:-( they just were tasteless.

Made these as the original recipie stated. It wasn't something I would call a fry. I cooked them even longer than the longest time suggested because they didn't crip up at all. I would have left them in even longer but it would have resulted in them burning. They were very limp and somewhat watery in the middle. The flavor was bland even though I used fresh parm not the pre shredded. I have liked zucchini fries in the past but I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Made these for supper tonight - absolutely awesome!  I added some almond flour to the panko parmisian mix, and sprinkled with onion salt & pepper before throwing them in the oven.  It took about 10 minutes to prepare a cookie sheet full & the recipe made 2 cookie sheets.  These will definitely become a staple in our diet!

It was okay.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and used panko.  Using the flour method prior to the egg bath worked well.  I won't make it again as the effort to make these wasn't worth it.

These zucchini fries were very good.  Although time consuming.  I made about 10 fries per person.  So 40 fries.   So that's a lot of dipping and coating.  The only thing different that I did was add some italian seasoning and garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture.  Gave it more flavour.  We also used a chipotle dipping sauce.  Very good with it.

Wonderful side dish! I floured them first, then used 1/2 Italian bread crumbs and  1/2 crushed potato chips along with the parm and seasoned with garlic and onion powders, pepper and cayenne. Baked for 15 minutes, turned, then another 10. Came out perfect. Thank you for sharing!

These were amazing, delicious, and super easy to make . Instead of cutting into 3inch sticks, we did them in 1/2 inch circles cut in half.  Our garden produced some 15inch long by 5inches wide zucchinis, which made doing it this way much easier with the same outcome.

My husband and I love this recipe. It was easy to make and since I have a perforated Teflon baking sheet, I didn’t have to turn the zucchini half way through baking. The fries make a delicious side for grilled burgers. We cleaned them up !!      Homewood Farm

I added a bit of water to the whisked eggs and a bit of cornstarch to the dry mixture.    Salt as soon as they come out of the oven and these are AMAZING!!   I am going to try with almond flour next time instead of bread crumbs for a low-carb option.

I added seasoned salt and pepper to the bread crumb / parmesan mixture. The zucchini fries came out absolutely delicious! They only needed to bake for 20 minutes in my oven. We will definitely make these again!

I made it using Italian breadcrumbs and added a tsp of cornstarch. I found 425 was too high and baked at 400 for a few minutes longer. Super recipe! Definitely in the keep list!

We love these. I crush seasoned croutons for the bread crumbs and cook until they are  looking well done, a little crispy at the edges.

Seems to be missing a little flavor...can't quite put finger on it. But i was pleasantly surprised by the crunchy texture of the bread crumbs. They are best when served hot...they seem cool quickly. Willing to try again

I loved this recipe so much! The jerks that I live with (my family) did not. I’m so tired of cooking nice things for them only for it to go to the dogs! I will be making this again (for myself) and will enjoy it again tomorrow for lunch!

I used dry ranch seasoning mix n a little less bread crumbs n added coconut oil on top at end to give it a crunch. Yummy healthy side. Husband like them also.

The first time I made these I realized they needed more seasoning in the crumbs.  This time I added dried Italian seasoning, black pepper, and a little chili power. Turned out great.  You have to eat them right away, because they get soft if they sit too long.  Next time I'm going to try for spicier, and add ghost pepper powder.

For a healthier option to fried zucchini, this can't be beat. Not as crispy as fried, but still delicious.

I used parchment paper to avoid the oil.

When I make it again I will add a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture, for a little more intense flavor. Great way to introduce squash to kids

These are delicious.  Takes time to cut and bread, but worth the effort.  Make sure you grate the cheese very fine or it wont’t stick to the zucchini.

Great!  The turned up noses and "Do I have to have some?" turned into a completely empty bowl.

Be sure to cut them thin enough, and cook them long enough.  I did use the broiler for a couple minutes for each side at the end.

This is my go to Dungeons and Dragons night snack.   Light, crispy and delicious,  zucchini fries do what fried potatoes don't.  Stay good cold.  Add anything to the mix to give it more flavor and this is the most versatile snack I've made.  a snack that is healthy and gives the vegetable serving you need, Zucchini Fries are a must have for me.

Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. It was difficult to get the seasoning to stick, and messy to make. The end product was somewhat bland. Overall not my favorite way to eat zucchini.

Followed the recipe exactly. Two zucchini filled two baking sheets completely. The only tip I’d suggest is to line the sheets with tin foil and spray liberally with non-stick spray. Serve with marinara!

I followed the recipe as written except I tossed the zucchini spears in seasoned(salt/pepper) flour before dipping in the egg. With 3 zucchini, I had to use 3 eggs and triple the bread crumbs and cheese. These were delicious!!!  It was time consuming to bread them all, but well worth it!

Tasty, but had a hard time getting the breadcrumbs and cheese to stick. Very good though I added salt to give a little more flavor.

I love this recipe for a couple reasons. First, I love how simple the recipe is. It doesn’t require a lot of ingredients and it is very versatile. I like adding red pepper flakes and garlic salt. Next time I want to try a ranch packet. Secondly, it I made them gluten free by using GF bread crumbs.

These were nice and crunchy but needed a bit of seasoning.  We added salt and, after they were finished cooking, melted a small amount of shredded Mexican blend cheese (about 1tsp/ "fry") on them.  Very good!  Even my picky 15 year old liked them!

I've made these a bunch of times, and they're great!  I serve them along side a big, fat, juicy cheeseburger, and it makes me feel a little less guilty :)  Slice the zucchini kinda thick so they stay juicy on the inside (and don't dry out) while getting golden brown on the outside.  I've tried them with panko bread crumbs, but regular bread crumbs adhere much better and result in the crisp exterior we all crave.  And, I add seasonings-of-choice to the bread crumbs, because flavor is king.

Our family isn't a big cooked veggies bunch but we all really liked this recipe! It was fairly quick and very easy. The only change we made was making thinner pieces for more crunch and less squish.

I made the oven baked zucchini fries. We loved them. We love zucchini any way it can be made !!!  Next time I may try putting the fries in a shallow pan with a swirl of olive oil and let them sautee instead of bake.  I  had some sauce left over from making lasagna, so we dipped the fries into the warmed sauce this time.

These were simple and really good. 2nd time I made them instead of the egg I brushed them with a mixture of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing to give them some zing.

I added a little garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper. My son and husband aren't huge into veggies and they ate it all. Also: lie that it's not fried in oil.

A new family favorite! Definitely want to make sure that your zucchini is cut in near-identical size pieces for even cooking. Next time I will flip them half way through the cooking time also. There are endless flavoring options to change this up but the Parma was excellent!

Thanks for this recipe. It was very good and super easy! I just made these tonight for a fun dinner appetizer. Crisped right up in the oven.  I mixed in some tabasco sauce  into the egg and used spicy store brand bread crumbs.  It was not bland at all. I'm going to experiment with different dips , and  I can see this recipe used with different veggies too.  Will be making these again.

If your garden zucchini grew too large, this is an excellent recipe to use.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added a sprinkle of garlic powder & salt for extra flavor.  Served with garlic dressing, it's also good with pizza or marinara sauce.
Leftovers were delicious cold the next day.

I made the zucchini fries tonight and they were delicious!!! To be honest, I don't even like zucchini, but I ate these-YUM!! I did not use foil, I sprayed the baking sheet with cooking spray and baked them directly on it.  I baked them in the convection oven, setting the oven temperature to 400 degrees (making the actual temperature 425 as indicated in the instructions).  The best part about convection is you don't have to flip them and they were crispy/crunchy and not greasy!! I will definitely make these again!!! Thank you!

I coated the strips with corn starch first  to make everything stick better, but it's not necessary. Also I used panko instead of bread crumbs- very light and crunchy.  These were delicious- my kids were fighting over who got the last one.

I followed the recipe.  I even used my convection oven and left them in for 15 minutes longer and they were still not crisp.  Next time I'll fry them.

The bread crumb and parmesan mix wouldn't stick to the eggwashed zucchini pieces at all. The recipe really needs some spices added, even if it had stayed on, because they tasted pretty bland.

I have to say I love love love zucchini sticks and always order the when dining out cuz I just can't make them as good, but this recipe made them perfect!!! I made just a few modifications... 1) I did not turn them, 2) after the timer went off, I took them out, turned on the broiler, sprayed the tops then put back in for 2-3 mins. Perfectly crisp!!

It's a good base recipe! there's plenty of room to add your own twist for flavor which is fantastic. I followed recipe but added some paprika in the dry mix.

Quick and fail proof.  I substituted flax seed & almond meal mix for the bread crumbs in an attempt to keep it healthy.  Turned out delicious!

My family loves this recipe.  I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs, so they were nice and crispy.  I have made it twice now and it was a winner both times.

Bland but otherwise a keeper. Next time, I'll add Italian seasoning or another herb combo as this seriously needed at least salt! I liked that this was baked. I broiled it in final moments to crisp. Goof way to use zucchini!

Easy & healthy way to make zucchini! Hubs liked it, too. Others had said it was bland, so I: substituted panko for bread crumbs. Then in my beaten eggs I added garlic powder, salt, pepper & Italian seasonings. Baked well. Then served with Ranch dressing on side. Delish!

I look for a base point and get ideas off others.   I sliced zukes in rounds to make the surface area easier to crisp.  I placed them on paper towels and lightly salted them to sweat out moisture for 30 minutes.   I then patted dry and dipped in cornstarch, dipped in eggs, then dipped in the bread crumb mixture, to which I added garlic and Cajun spice.  Sprayed the pan with pam and a baked at 425.  
The result was great.  I had no problems wit Breading falling off.  And had crispy "fries"

Not as good as fried squash, but healthier.  I use panko breadcrumbs, as they have a better texture. Also be sure to season the breadcrumbs well.

These were great! Followed the recipe, adding 1/2 tsp seasoned salt to the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture due to one reviewer's 'bland'comment. Used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs because i had them. I have a temperamental old oven from the 30's and this evening 400 degrees became 450, but that was fine because the 'fries' browned up nice and crispy, the zucchini was cooked and it all took just 12 minutes. One drawback is the time it takes to dip and dredge these yummy little critters! Definitely plan on some extra time for this step of the prep!

Made these the other night and just getting a chance to review them. I have to agree with someone earliers post that these by the recipie given are a bit bland. I actually thought that before I'd finished making  them so i added a few things spicewise  to the breadcrumbs. A bit of garlic and onion powder as well as a bit of paprika helps but even then they were still a bit bland for my tastes.  I used both regular and panko bread crumbs which gave a nice crunch. I strongly recommend using parchment paper instead of the sprayed aluminum foil. No greasiness and no need to turn them. Will have to make them again and may try the ranch dressing mix in the coating. I will say it was a bit difficult getting the breading to stick to the "fries". i feel that it was because zucchini is such a water heavy veggie . My thought is to try and salt and drain the slices prior to attempting to applying the breading to make it stick better.  Overall a decent and with ranch dressing tasty recipie, but it needs a little tweaking to make it a 5? rating.

Turned out great- animal ingredient free. I substituted the Parmesan with Nutritional Yeast, the breadcrumbs with cornmeal (necessity) and used ground flax meal as the binding agent. I love how crunchy they turn out.

I dipped them in flour first, then egg, then the bread crumbs, next time I will just do the egg and bread crumbs. But overall, they were delicious, will definitely make them again. I have also made these with asparagus

I added some extra spices as stated in other reviews as it was pretty bland other wise and I mixed panko with regular bread crumbs.  With those changes it was 5 star.  Also, I made the garlic aioli from this site and it tasted just like I was at Maggianos restaurant.

Surprisingly good and easy! We used a big zucchini, about 3" in diameter and 12" long. We had to increase the bread crumbs and cheese mix to accommodate so much zucchini, but that was very easy also. All pieces turned out well--crispy outside and soft inside--even the inner pieces. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great, simple recipe to use extra zuchinni. Even the kids loved them! Impressive! Do eat right away when still hot, as they will end up getting soggy.

Awesome way to use zucchini! I rolled the zucchini sticks in flour first, as another reviewer suggested, then the egg, and then I used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese. These were great!

I really like these healthier alternative to fries! I did however like many others have to add spices to the breadcrumb mixture. I added some paprika and garlic powder which added to the flavor will definitely make again!

This was surprisingly very good. I was worried of them being soggy..but they weren't! I used a bread crumb mixture which was already seasoned with Parmesan and some Italian herbs. I ended up needed more breadcrumbs then recommended. I suggest seasoning each layer with some salt and pepper (or your favorite spices-zucchini, eggs, crumbs) . I dipped these in the Zucchini and Chive dip from this site. Chipolte, or Cayenne pepper would be a nice addition..maybe next time .

They are very bland and the breadcrumbs do not really stick to the zucchini fries. Good idea but needs work. Thanks for sharing.

It took longer to make than I had originally thought it would.  They  also never got crisp.  They were still somewhat soggy.  They were ok but I probably won't make them again.

I found regular bread crumbs to be too fine, I think Panko might make an improvement. DEFINITELY needed more flavor...salt? Cayenne pepper?

Very tasty, loved the Parmesan. Texture is nowhere near fries though--I would call these breaded zucchini fingers :) I used yellow squash but otherwise we followed the recipe, it was a great side.

My husband positively gobbled these up. I followed the recipe except for adding some garlic salt and lemon pepper to the homemade bread crumbs for flavor. I did NOT have to flip them because at the 20 minute mark, they were golden and plenty done. I think the reason it took less time is because I cut these small, to a bit less than jo-jo potato size. The reason I only gave them a 4 is because I personally found them too "bread-y" and not very flavorful. But if my husband likes them, you can be sure I'll be making them again.

I had a really hard time getting the bread crumbs to stick, as did some others,according to the photos = ) ... I started with panko, then dumped a lot of regular bread crumbs into the panko, thinking maybe that was why the crumbs weren't sticking, but didn't seem to help.

These were really tasty. Like fried food but without the guilt! Second time I made as larger slices instead of fries since it was quicker and easier to dip & coat. My husband thought they were very yummy too.

Adding some herbs like basil and parsley gives a little flavor boost. Garlic salt sounds like a good idea. Grandchildren loved making them and dug in to finish them off as soon as baked. Served with ranch dressing as dipping sauce.

Delicious! These crispy critters came out great. Next time I'll add some seasonings to the bread crumbs like the others stated because they were a little bland. However, we ate them with Ranch dressing...yum! I'll definitely make these again!

Yum, I was trying to get more veggies in. This was a great recipe.  I also added some onion powder and garlic salt to jazz up the zucchini.  Do a good job of shaking off the extra egg otherwise your breadcrumb and cheese mix will get soggy.  I highly recommend this recipe for zucchini fries:)

Easy and delicious!  To give it a bit more flavor, I added oregano, parsley, and garlic salt.  I also used about half as many bread crumbs.  This recipe also works with yellow summer squash. :)

I seasoned the veggies and also my batter, if I did not I feel this would have been tasteless, they came out great and will do it again

Added salt, pepper and garlic powder before I baked.  Delicious.   Probably a new favorite for my four year old

Easy to make n fast. I think next time I would add a bit more cheese or season the breadcrumbs. I actually used panko.

My first time baking, this was a good, basic recipe. I also healthed it up by doing egg whites instead of the whole egg.

Tasty.

These were great!  The only thing I suggest is adding Lowrey's garlic salt to the mix.  It takes it to the next level!
