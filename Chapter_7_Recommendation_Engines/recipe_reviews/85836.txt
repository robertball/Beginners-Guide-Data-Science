This recipe was pretty good.  It is more of a stew than a casserole.  I made a few changes: I used one bottle of beer instead of water, I added garlic to the onion sautee, and I added a chipotle seasoning as other reviewers said it needed something.  I also cooked it covered, since it didn't seem to be cooking the brats well with the lid off.  I would make it again, we are a family that loves brats and we're always looking for something a little different!

Good basis but needs some tweaking to make it more flavorful. I added some freshly minced garlic to the onion. Also used Adobo seasoning instead of salt, added a can of diced tomatoes, and also a shake of red pepper flakes. Turned out pretty good.

This is great especially during rainy days!! I found out that Brats with beer flavor tasted exceellent than regular Brats. It's really delicious with steamy jasmine cooked rice.  Thanks for sharing this comfort food!!!

Interesting combination, but very bland.  It needs something to spice it up.

This was outstanding even though my troopers were a little sceptical at first. I added garlic with the onions like someone had recommended and also used the beer instead of the water for the green beans, FABULOUS! I also added 4T butter instead of 2.

This dish tastes like home...

I actually used some leftover brats that we had grilled the day before and some crumbled bacon that I cooked in the pan first. I left just enough bacon grease to coat the bottom of the pan before saut√©ing my onions and adding the cabbage.   This was so good - my 2 year old was eating it up!

My husband devoured it, so it was a success. 

For two servings, I fried 2 slices of bacon, and used a little of the bacon grease to cook the onion in. I used a large frying pan, so after the onion was tender, I arranged the cabbage around the sides of the pan, put the parboiled beans in the center, added chicken broth, sausage, and put a half pat of butter on the 4 cabbage wedges. I shook some Adobe over all, and cooked until the cabbage was tender. I used no sugar, salt or pepper. I did sprinkle bacon pieces over each plate at serving time.

A nice change from the 20000 "beer battered" options.  A good, round flavor with an entertaining color palette.

I found neither the salt nor the sweetener necessary, and would instead recommend a spice melody to taste after an initial sampling.

I added tomatos and chicken bullion to the water and garlic to the onions. I didn't have brats so I used mild Italian sausage  instead which did give it the kick everyone said the recipe missed.

Loved this!!  The only thing I changed is instead of splenda, I used brown sugar (about a tablespoon of it.) This will be made again.
