This is a delicious soup!  I will make a couple of changes next time: one can of coconut milk and half a can of water (rather than 2 cans of coconut milk), I will use fresh veggies and only yellow, red and orange colored ones - I had some green veggies in my frozen mixture and they turned the soup a slightly unattractive yellow/brownish color.  Otherwise, my kids enjoyed this as much as I did.  I served it with fresh biscuits.

This is a nice, creamy vegan soup that is both warming and filling. I'd make it again, even though cauliflower isn't my favorite.

Made as directed. Delicious! It was a little more soup-y (less creamy) than I expected, so I might decrease the coconut milk next time, but nonetheless, the whole family loved it as made!

Been trying to do the daniel fast and this recipe fit the bill! Vegan and healthy! It was a it bland and if i could have put a bit of cheddar cheese on to it would've been awesome, but it is hearty and warm and pretty darn good all by itself!
