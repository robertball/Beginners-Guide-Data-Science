This was a very simple and easy recipe, I thought it was very moist I would make it again.

This recipe was easy to follow and quick to make.  But definitely more crumb topping needs to be saved for the yummy part of the cake!  over all, it was just okay.  not the best stuff to show off though.

I made this crumb cake this morning and by bed time there was only 1/4 of it left.  My family thought it was delectible.  I did make a few alterations.  I used 2 eggs, and since I didn't have buttermilk I used regular milk.  I also added 1/2 cup brown sugar to the mix for the crumb topping.  Oh, I added a sprinkle of Tastefully Simple Mulling Spice too!  I am sure this will be enjoyed by our family for years to come!

A wonderful easy tastee crumb cake.  Goes very well with a fresh ground bold cup of coffee.  I like lots of nummy topping, I added half again the butter and sugars on top.  Will be a once a month treat, at least.

Maybe I shouldn't have done this here but  didn't want to go buy buttermilk so instead I soured regular milk with lemon, accordingly.  
The texture came out more like a sponge cake than a crumb cake. The topping looked almost raw even though the cake itself was completely done.  I just don't quite get it.

This was a very good coffee cake; nice and moist and flavorful. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a standard substitution (a tablespoon of white vinegar, with milk added to total one cup liquid) which worked fine. My son had to be restrained from eating the whole thing. My husband liked it a lot, too. My daughter and I prefer a more buttery, firm cake with a more cinnamon-y topping. That's just a matter of personal preference, though--the cake as is is great.

My daughter loved it. Very fragrant but to me it was more of a spice cake. I just wanted a crumb cake but didnt feel that this was what I was looking for.

This had a strange consistency that is hard to describe. It was almost like a bread pudding but more firm. It also looked raw on top but was cooked through. My family finished it, but I don't think I'll make it again

With the addition of brown sugar to crumb mixture plus 1 more egg as suggested by another review, I love this cake. Not sure if I should give it 4 stars because I did alter the recipe. So good it is gobbled up quickly.

Not your traditional New York style crumb cake.  But the cloves definitely give it a very unique taste that is pretty satisfying.
