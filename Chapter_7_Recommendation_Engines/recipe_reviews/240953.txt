Very good base!  I upped the cayenne and added a little chile powder, garlic powder, and a touch of cumin.  Used to baste on chicken wings and reserved some to use as extra dipping sauce.

I made this to use as a cold dipping sauce for our Alice Springs chicken.  Delicious!  I didn’t make any changes.  It’s great as is!

I  made this sauce to pair with Margarita Grilled Shrimp (another great recipe here at Allrecipes).  It was a lovely compliment to the spicy shrimp... would be great on a shrimp taco.

Wow!! Super tasty! Perfect amount of flavor. Tangy with s a hint of sweetness. Making shrimp tacos tonight and can’t wait to use it. Definitely going to be added to my regular sauces. Super simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. Thank you!

We tried it on both burgers & chicken sandwiches.  Changes: Used sour cream instead of mayo (don't like mayo) and added 1 tsp of liquid smoke, 1/2 to 1 tsp garlic powder & 1 tsp of sweet paprika.  I also only used 1-1/2 tsp sugar then refrigerated for a few hours before using.  Remember to adjust seasonings to your families taste.

It was ok on a chicken sandwich..the only thing I may have did wrong was I used bama mayo... would be better if I used a diferent mayo that was more bland than Bama
