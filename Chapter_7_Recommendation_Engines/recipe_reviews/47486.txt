These did indeed smell spicy as they were baking!  In fact, when I tried one I was surprised to find they weren't as spicy as the aroma led me to imagine they'd be.  Not that that's a bad thing!  These are, in fact, delicately spiced (I used all spices as directed)  and just barely sweet, which is actually refreshing for a muffin (if I want cake, I'll eat cake).  However, if you like a sweeter muffin you could easily add a little more sugar.  I used candy coated/chocolate covered sunflower seeds which I've learned bleed in wet batters!  (But are great in cookie doughs)  While the sunflower seeds were "ok," I think I'd rather have raisins, dates or other dried fruit that might add that hint of sweetness and contrasting flavor that these missed for me.  These are definitely flavorful, moist and bake up with pretty, domed tops.  I left some of them as is and glazed the rest with a mixture of powdered sugar and lemon juice.

After mixing the wet and dry ingredients, there just wasn't enough moisture to combine the two. I added about 3 tablespoons of water and that did the trick. I baked them for 27 minutes. They turned out really well and super moist. The sunflower seeds adds a nice texture. I will make these again.

These are definitely spice muffins. I couldn't find my coriander so I left it out, but there was plenty of spice flavor in them without it. I added one large grated carrot to the zucchini and used prune butter and 1 T of oil in place of the 1/3 cup of oil, and left out the sunflower seeds entirely since I don't like them. Even with these changes the muffins came out really moist and fluffy, and were very easy to eat and eat and eat. I did get quite of few of them, though. I made 18 regular sized muffins and 20 mini muffins, although that could have been because I added more to the batter (the carrot).

I have made this recipe twice, the second time I doubled it because the first ones went so fast! I made 21 muffins and a 9x13 cake. I plan to ice the cake with cream cheese icing. The only changes I made were to the spices. I left out the coriander and added more of the others, mostly cinnamon, but allspice and cloves as well. I also substituted the seeds for rasins (personal preference) and it worked really well. I'll definately be making this a LOT! Great recipe for zucchini, mostly because I have so many to use!!

I cut this recipe down to twelve servings. I used hot brewed Tazo chai tea instead of plain water. I also used whole wheat flour, pecans instead of sunflower seeds (only because my family isn't big on sunflower seeds), I cut the salt down to a pinch and the sugar down to a half cup (we're really watching our salt/sugar intake) and I kept all the spices and vanilla to a teaspoon for the twelve muffins. After folding the wet ingredients into the dry, the mixture was still too dry. I needed to add another 3/4 cup of liquid to get it to combine and look like muffin batter. I did add 3/4 cup of lowfat buttermilk. The smell of these baking is really out of this world. All of us really enjoyed them, though mine did turn out a little dry. It could just be because I did cut the recipe back or maybe I baked them too long or overmixed them due to the not enough liquid. Still, a great muffin. I think next time, I might add a half cup of organic raisins in the shredded zucchini step. Keeping the spices high in this recipe really negated the need for extra fat or sugar. This is a really flavorful zucchini muffin.

I believe these would be much better without the sunflower seeds.  Will try them without next time.

Delicious, chopped up a small bag of mixed seed, nuts and fruit and added it to the muffin dough.   Even my picky eater loved these muffins and said they are the best ever, and she got the sevret ingredient vegetables.

SO GOOD. I made a healthier variety with 1 c white rice flour, 1 3/4 spelt flour and 1 tsp xanthan gum. Also reduced the sugar to 2/3c and they were plenty sweet. The spices override it all and they are a fabulous mix!

Wow, these taste great, I love the spices. I substituted 2 small spoonfuls of honey for the sugar - if you don't like overly sweet,  the honey gives it just enough.  I also used egg whites only.  They turned out great, I recommend this!

I missed an ingredient the first time I made these, but the second time they were WONDERFUL.  I also skipped the sunflower seeds, but these are great because I can make a large batch, and they freeze really well. Take a couple out of the freezer just before going to bed, and they're a great healthy grab-and-go pick.  For an even healthier variety, replace the eggs and oil with a small can of pumpkin- in this recipe, you won't even taste the pumpkin, and will cut down the fat content even more.

Absolutely delicious - I used 2 cups whole wheat flour to 3/4 cup white.  And I used less sugar.  It seemed like a lot to me, and I don't like a sweet muffin.  Love the sunflower seed crunch!!

Hmmm...I'm more than a little puzzled as to what the "5th" spice is!!  Vanilla? Sunflower seeds?  Oh well, no matter, even without a fifth spice, these muffins are aMAZing!  With no coriander in my spice rack, I decided to substitute ginger along with a smidgen of dried orange peel.  The sunflower seeds were replaced with raisins [I'll try dried cranberries next time just for the change], oil was replaced with 1/3 cup of plain yogurt & 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed, cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup of white & 1/2 cup of brown [& the muffins were Plenty sweet enough] & finally added a large shredded carrot as one reviewer suggested.   The verdict?  Every blessed muffin was gone at work before our first coffee break!!  I gave the recipe to 4 co-workers by the end of the day!!    That's it!  This recipe shouldn't be called five Spice...it's Five Star Muffins!!!   ;-DDDD

Very warm flavor but I think the sunflower seeds mess up the texture and mouth-feel. I like sunflower seeds and was excited to use them, but it just didn't seem to work here. Golden raisins would be a good fit. Warm them before serving for extra coziness!

We loved these muffins.  What a great way to use a zucchini.  My 5 year old daughter said they tasted just like pumpkin pie.   I thought they were more like a dense spice cake.   I didn't have any coriander so I didn't use it.  I didn't cut back on any of the other spices and the taste was just right.

Exceptional! The flavor of these muffins is outstanding! I used sucanat instead of white sugar and baked jumbo muffins instead of regular sized. They even looked perfect with high domed tops. I must admit I did not use the sunflower seeds because I didn't have any, but I did add a few blueberries. I will be making these often! In fact I may just use this recipe for my zucchini bread as well.It is that good! The spices make the muffin!

Excellent base recipe but modified it more than usual- used 1/3 Cup buttermilk, 1.5 Tb oil,used 3 cups WW flour, added 3 TB gluten, 1 TB baking powder; also next time, will reduce the clove as it did not please my little guy; the spice mix was really nice as was the added veggies - thank you for the recipe

My family fell in love with these muffins, even my finicky boys who hate vegetables.  I didn't tell them that there was zucchini in them and they couldn't tell (and I never told them either).  This is an easy way to get another serving of vegies into everyones diet without much trouble.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Well, I was really hoping I'd *love* these but unfortunately I didn't. They were just OK.  I followed the recipe as written except I did add 1/2 cup raisins. They weren't exactly 'dry' but weren't as moist as I would have liked them. I filled 24 muffin cups and only baked them for 18 minutes which was enough. Keep in mind that sunflower seeds have a very distinct flavor; I've never used them in muffins and I didn't quite like the strong flavor in a muffin.  I would have preferred walnuts or pecans. I won't make these again as there are other recipes that we love better (hint: banana crumb muffins!!).

These were good.  They tasted like zucchini bread in the shape of muffins.  I thought the spice quantities were perfect.  They almost tasted like spice cake.

I also added an extra 3 Tablespoons of water to this recipe.  I substituted 1/3 cup of melted butter in place of the oil It turned out quite nicely.  I also sprinkled some vanilla sugar that I had kicking around on top of each one.  The smell was heavenly.

These were a very good and held together well, not dry or crumbly.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and halved all the dry spices, it was perfect.  I don't know if I like the sunflower seeds in them, I'm going to try a different nut, maybe walnuts or pecans.  Everyone in my family loved them! Thanks for the recipe!

The spice flavor is great, but they are way too sweet.  If you like store bought muffins, which should be called cupcakes, then use all the sugar.  I'm going to add the spices to a more healthy whole grain muffin recipe.

Yum!  I did make a few changes since I wanted to be able to give some to my little one.  I didn't use the sunflower seeds & cut the ground seasonings in half.  The flavor was subtle but very nice.  I can imagine that the full amounts would be nice, as well, as would including the sunflower seeds.  I didn't have any trouble mixing the dry & the wet ingredients that others mentioned.  I will definitely make this again!  Very tasty!

I was really impressed with this recipe.  It has wonderful flavor and a great texture.  I can't wait to make it again! I made 12 muffins and 24 mini's  (I didn't have the sunflower seeds this time, but I'll make sure to have them on hand next time.)

Wow, this is an amazingly good recipe! I made them for my baby (with a few modifications) and ended up eating a lot of them myself! My modifications: I used 1 cup grated zuchinni and 1 cup grated carrots, left out the sunflower seeds, used less sugar (one heaping cup instead of 1 1/2 cups and it was plenty sweet! I can't imagine using the full amount.), and I didn't have any cloves, so I used 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice instead. This recipe is SOOO good! We're down to our last muffin and I can't wait to make it again!

I brought these to work for a spontaneous "Happy Friday" treat and they disappeared in no time!  I used a whole, small round zucchini squash from which I removed the seeds and grated/chopped in the food processor, and used more wheat flour than white (1+3/4C wheat & 1C white.)  Also ground (then sifted) my own coriander in my coffee bean grinder because I only had the whole seed version.  Used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Finally, I added a couple handfuls of raisins just prior to adding the boiling water to the zuke mixture so they could soften and plump.  They turned out perfect!  Didn't have any sunflower seeds to add but definitely will make a point of it next time for the crunch factor.  Spicy good!  A+!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  I did not have coriander, nutmeg, or sunflower seeds, so I ommitted those and the muffins were still good.  If I make again, I will add a little more sugar, because I would've liked them a little sweeter.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not have any trouble with this recipe being too dry. But my zucchini was frozen so it had lots of extra water in it. I baked mine for 30 minutes. I thought they came out great.

I make this every year for Christmas. In the summer I grate up zucchini from my garden in the food processor, measure out 2 cup increments and put it in freezer bags. I don't use the boiling water because freezing the zucchini makes them soft. Leaving out the water makes the recipe perfect for high altitude. Thaw it out and you're ready to go! The coriander gives a nice flavor and the sunflower seeds are just a little different. I make mini loaves instead of muffins. Always a hit!

Made this recipe yesterday.  I only had white whole wheat flour on hand, so used that.  Replaced sunflower seeds with chopped pecans (personal preference). Cut sugar back to about 1 cup, mixed together white and brown sugar. Used cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, as these were the spices I had on hand. Cut the salt back to just about 1/8 t, the recipe amount called for seemed like much too much?  Added some fresh lemon zest to the batter.  As others mentioned, my batter was a bit too dry, so I had some heavy whipping cream on hand (why not??) and stirred in, just a drizzle of it, till the batter seemed moist enough.  I had to bake this in a 9x9 in pan, as I could not find my muffin form.  We ended up with kind of a cake or Zucchini Bread.  But, it was just a bit dry.  Great flavor though.  It may have been the reduction of sugar AND the whole wheat flour that contributed to the dryness.  So, next time, I think I'll increase the amount of shredded zucchini or even add some shredded carrot as others did, to get the moisture level up, but still keep it healthy.

Delicious! I made them vegan by substituting ground flax seed and water for the eggs. Also used applesauce for the oil. Very tasty and nice combination of seasoning/spices.

We loved this recipe. I used frozen zuchinni and added all the liquid too. I also added about 1 cup if mixed chopped dried fruit along with the raw sunflower seeds - really nice and moist and perfectly spiced.

Very moist and yummy. My roomate loved them. I didn't add any sunflower seeds beause I didn't have any but it didn't matter. Not too sweet. I might add a bit more sugar next time because I have a sweet tooth.

This is an excellent recipe, I really enjoyed it.  I didnt' have the coriander or cloves but I added a pinch of ginger instead and it still turned out great.  The muffins were moist and rich and delicious!
