This is one of the best recipes I have used in making coffee liqueur.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  That gave it a very rich taste.

Excellent!  I recommend using a mid priced brand of bottle, b/c you can definetly taste the difference when it's a cheap brand.  I like to mix this with skim milk to save calories but get the great flavor.

The review by JENNYF10 must be for some other recipe - this one does not use coffe grounds.

I think it tastes as good as the famous name brand but is a little thinner in texture, everyone loves it.

easy and yummy! although I skipped the step of wiping off the "scum" (whatever that is), I didn't see anything weird on the surface.

This worked well although it was very messy trying to strain the coffee grounds from the sugary syrup.  I'll try an instant coffee recipe next time.

great recipe the only thing I changed was using sugar in the raw instead of white sugar. Everyone who has tried it loved it
