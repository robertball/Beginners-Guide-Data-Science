Hi everyone! so, i live in chile where this is a very popular cake. But it is a very intense cake, a little piece will go a loooooooong way, thats why several bakerys here have started to include pastry cream in it. so along with the "manjar" that is the thickend condensed milk, you put one layer of pastry cream and one layer of manjar. To make the manjar more spreadable you need to do this: whip up 3/4 cup of whipping cream and fold in to the manjar. this makes a less intense cake. if you want the intense cake use the manjar mixture without the pastry cream layers. if you use the pastry cream it will still be very intense! You can also make 3 different layeres: whipping cream, pastry cream and manjar. this will make it a lighter cake, BUT STILL INTENSE! to decorate spread a thin layer of manjar over and around the cake and sprinkle generously with walnuts. it can also be shredded coconut. you can be creative with this. people here even make it with manjar, raspberry jam and pastry cream!

This recipe is an amazing authentic Chilean cake also known as “Torta de Mil Hojas” or “Thousand Layers Cake.”  I made this for my Chilean husband’s birthday and he was very impressed with the results.  I rolled each layer out as thin as possible then I cut out the layers by using a 9” round cake pan as a template so all my layers were uniform.  Make sure you only cook the layers until they are just lightly brown, if you wait too long they will dry out too much and taste burnt.  My oven isn’t large at all so I could only cook 2 layers at a time.  It took a loooonnng time to make everything and put it all together; the est cook time of 1 hour is way off.   If I included the cooking time for the sweetened condensed milk, the whole cake took me about 5 hours to put together, but it was totally worth it.   Also, the longer the cake sits, the more the caramel penetrates the layers so the better it tastes!

This dessert came out fabulous! I had eaten it years ago at a Chilean friends house, and mine came out just as good. I added a bit more butter to the pastry just so that it was more flaky and would reduce the chance of it drying out. Mine baked for about 15 mins and the layers were perfect. A trick to cut down the 'dulce de leche' prep time. Put the can of condensed milk completely submerged in a pressure cooker and cook under full pressure for 20 mins. I have done it many times and it come out perfect and in a fraction of the time. It's nice to assemble it and leave in the refrigerator the day before or early in the day before serving as the layers get a bit moist and kind of mesh into each other nicely.

I have been looking for this receipe for 15 to 16 
years... after having mislayed mine. My son married a young girl from Chile and I made it for their "wedding cake." It was such a success & the first of many dulces to be eaten til it was gone... the guests even asked for MORE! I can easily give it a 5 star rating all the way down the line. Such a treat!!! joan green/orem,utah

We adapted this recipe to cap off a Chilean wine tasting party and it was a huge hit.  We found that the comments of reviewers on this page were very helpful; e.g., the prep/cooking times are longer than the recipe suggests, but the cake is still well worth the effort for a special occasion.  It is best to make and assemble the cake the evening before; this allows the cake to settle and solidify (important when it comes to cutting the cake), and for the flavors (brandy, "manjar" (dulce de leche), sweet cream (which we added), walnuts (not chopped but ground up in a food processor; gave a finer texture)) to infuse into the pastry.  Also, we felt it helped to paint the baked pastry layers with undiluted brandy.  Just before serving, we topped the cake with whipped cream, fresh raspberries, and ground walnuts (see photo by recipe title).

This was a fantastic dessert!  I made the recipe as instructed and it looked like an artisan masterpiece.  I got rave reviews on it as well.  It is very time consuming, I think I may add the whipped topping for the final layer next time.

This cake was very delicious for my family. I have heard much about "Torta de mil hojas", but I`ve never tried it before. I decided to try this recipe. I had only one can sweetened condensed milk and I used Katie`s suggestions about pastry cream. And to our family taste, the cake wasn`t so rich and intense. But to my personal taste the dough was too dry. I baked it until lighly brown (some of the layers weren`t lighly brown at all), approximately 10 minutes. Probably, I don`t like such kind of dough. If your layers aren`t lightly brown, but you feel, they are set, don`t bake any more. I also think it is not necessary to use water when you sprinkle the layers.

This recipe is awesome! I used a large plate to cut out the circles so they were all an equal size. I'm making this cake again today to sell at a Chilean fundraiser!

I loved making this cake and it tastes great.  They only think is that its time is misleading.  It takes in the neighborhood of 4 hours.  The frosting I used was a fluffy what frosting made from egg whites, boiled sugar water and cream of tartar which was then dumped into the freshly beaten egg whites which were flavored with vanilla and fresh cinnamon.  Let me know what you guys think

I made mine with the alternate layers of whipped cream/manjar mixture and covered the whole stack with manjar, which required boiling four cans of condensed milk.  I put chopped walnuts all 'round the side and strawberries on top.  It's among the photos shown here.  I must admit, it was surprisingly delicious.  The flavor was not quite as intense as I had read in other reviews, and I noticed that after eating a whole slice, the flavor did not linger very long.  It did not weigh heavily on my stomach either.  I would consider it a tasty, full-bodied dessert, but not overly filling.  The manjar was not like a dense, heavy caramel.  It was thin and light tasting, although very sticky.

It was very good, and we will make it again, but it was not fabulous enough to impress seven judges in a dessert bake-off at my workplace.  It did not even place in the top four.  It lost out to flan, apple pie, lemon cupcakes, and apple crisp.

I was asked to make this cake for Chilean neighbors. I had never heard of this cake before, so I went online to see photos and videos.  

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I was confused about 'cook until golden brown'. When cooked, mine was not golden, more like shortbread color.  I'm glad I choose not to continue baking, because the cake would have been too dry. 

Definitely makes this cake 1-2 days in advance.  If you refrigerate, make sure to get cake to room temperature before serving. Oh and my neighbors loved it. So did I!

I made this for a friend's birthday celebration and was a bit nervous since she is from Chile and I've never had this before.  She made my day by raving about it!  I used a homemade sweetened condensed milk recipe from this site and cooked it in a sauce pan until caramelized. That was my only tweak.  I will definitely make this again!

Good dough.  I wanted something less overwhelming so I rotated dulce de leche with ganache and whipped cream with raspberry halves.  Huge hit

This cake is very time consuming, but like anything that takes time, it is excellent.  The flavor is very unique and delicious.  I did not add any nuts because the prices are incredibly high these days.  I found it difficult to get the layers thin enough, but I made everything the size it instructed.  It just makes it a bit difficult to eat when the layers are so thick, but not bad.  I wasn't going to add the brandy at first, but glad I did because it gives the cake a very special flavor.  I will be making this again for sure.  I might add a frosting next time, but definitely not needed.  It's something fun to experiment with.  You won't regret it!

Thanks everyone for your help with making this recipe better!! As for making it without brandy..would be fine to just omit for a different flavor, although you'll still have to moisten the layers with something.
You could also sub an extract or LorAnn oil to get the flavor without the alcohol.
