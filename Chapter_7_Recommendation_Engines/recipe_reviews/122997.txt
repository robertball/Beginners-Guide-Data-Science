Surprisingly good! I was doubting the whole thing as I was preparing it thinking there was something missing, but I was happily surprised. I followed recipie exactly and used canned ham. Not worth 5 stars but 4 for ease and simplicity. Didn't do the olives because I didn't know black or green

This is a very good combination that I've never thought of. We really liked it! I made it a little differently and used chicken ramen instead of Oriental.   I cooked the cubed ham on a grill pan to brown it and then added it to the drained, cooked noodles and broccoli. I used frozen broccoli and cooked it in the noodles & broth before draining the broth (to reduce sodium - but some nutrients might have been lost from making the broccoli this way). Added lite soy sauce just before serving. I will make this again!

Really good and easy!  I'll make it again.  I will 
try leaving out the seasoning packet next time.  It was a little bit salty.  I also added a bit of garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch of ground pepper.

Odd combo of ingredients. I like all these separately but they just didn't work well for me in this. Especially the black olives. I was hungry so I ate it, but it isn't something I would make again. I did have fun trying out a new recipe and it was a new adventure in dining. Sorry, this didn't appeal to me.

Gave it a five for extreme ease of prepare and because the family devoured the pan of a doubled recipe.

Sorry, we just didn't care for this.  It went together in a snap, so that was nice, but even my kids, who LOVE ramen noodles wouldn't eat this.  Just not for us.

I actually liked this.  Hame is not my forte so I think Kielbasa might be a better meat choice.  This dish is very filling.  Thanks for the idea and recipe.

4.5 Stars: We were very surprised at how good this simple recipe it and everyone enjoyed it. I noticed reviews saying it is too salty, but some are putting both seasoning packets in the dish.  ONLY USE ONE as the recipe states. I double (maybe tripled) the ham. The broccoli was fantastic and this is a great way to use up leftover ham.

Oh dear, loved the taste of this and added a bit more water and a cup of cauliflower and 1/8 cup of chopped red pepper.  But honestly it was VERY salty and that is why I won't be making it again.

Would have been better, maybe, if I had used 2 rather than 1 ramen noodle packages.

We really liked this dish.  Very tasty and SO EASY to prepare.  My husband and I ate the whole thing in one meal, served with tossed salad.  Yum!

This was absolutely wonderful and so easy. I made only half the recipe because there are only two of us in our home. Even then I had enough for a second meal. The leftovers were equally good.  This definitely is a winner!
