This was excellent. I made some very small changes. First, I used reduced fat yogurt. In a mini processor, I added half the amount of salt and pepper, 10 lemon drops, 2 large garlic cloves, 2 good shakes of dill weed spice, a dash of olive oil, and a full package of the fresh mint from the produce section. After chopping, I had a little less than 1/4 cup of mixture to mix in w/the yogurt and cucumber. Instead of cheese cloth, I used coffee filters and that worked great. Separating the liquid is an essential step!

I have always thought I made a great gyros sauce, but after I made this recipe, I threw mine away. I don't know if it's the mint because no one else had it in the other recipes or the yogurt. This is the best gyros sauce I have ever tasted, including restaurants. I have made it so many times I have the recipe in my head. Thanks

Wonderful and very authentic (I have been to Greece, and frequent Greek restaurants where I live).  I served this on pita bread with Souvlaki from this site.  I would highly recommend using the cheese cloth to drain the yogurt, as well as using a strainer for the cucumber to press out the liquid; otherwise, the sauce will be runny.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic and even easier if you use Greek yogurt and a food processor! I put the Greek yogurt in the processor along with the salt, pepper, crushed garlic, and 1/2 cup whole mint leaves (loosely packed). Then, I pulsed it for a bit to coarsely chop the mint and garlic. After that, I threw in the diced up cucumber and pulsed some more. The immediate results were DELICIOUS and I'm sure it will be even better after a night in the fridge.

This had really great flavor, and the best combination of ingredients of the tzatziki recipes on this site. However, the prep time could be seriously reduced if one used real Greek yogurt (like Oikos) that is already thick and does not require straining. I found this to be most difficult in my technologically challenged kitchen lacking cheesecloth or even the basic coffee filter. Needless to say, mine turned out a bit runny :P Used the food processor to chop and mix everything up. Served with falafel, lettuce, and tomato on a pita. The consistency didn't ruin anything, but will save myself the trouble and just use Greek yogurt next time.

I added half of a fresh squeezed lemon and a pinch of sugar. This is a wonderful recipe. Also I skinned and chopped my english cucumber and left it in a strainer with a little salt sprinkled on it. This way my cucumbers "sweat" out there juices rather than having a runny dip.and you dont need to spend precious time cleaning out the seeds.

Excellent! I didn't have cheese cloth so strained with a paper coffee filter. Subbed 1/2 tsp dried mint for fresh. Every one loved it with the Pork Souvlaki recipe from this site.

Very good. I made this to go with Moroccan Lamb Kabobs (also from this site.) I too strained the yogurt using a coffee filter. It worked really well, and I was AMAZED at how much water dribbled out!! I couldn't find fresh mint so I used dried, and I could hardly tell the difference. Excellent recipe. Thanks, Brenda!

Great recipe. I have made it a few times and it has always turned out well. I soemtimes add a little dill just for a change. To easily drain the cucumber, I use my salad spinner. I line the strainer portion with paper towel and then spin the cucumber. It dries it out really quickly.

I reduced the salt and pepper, and also drained the cucumber separately for 30 minutes. An easy way to drain the yogurt is to line a strainer with a coffee filter, then put the yogurt in that. We served it with lamb in homemade pita bread and it was delicious!

It was great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I did reduce the salt just a smidge, to accomodate what was in my gyro meat.  I will definitely make again.  Oh, on a side note...this freezes and thaws well.

I used Greek yogurt, so I didn't drain it.  I only had dried seasonings, so that's what I used.  I also didn't stick it in the fridge to chill before serving.  Despite this, it turned out AMAZING.  I put it on chicken that I'd cooked with Greek seasoning and topped it with tomatoes and lettuce in some flatbread.  My husband couldn't stop making sounds of joy while eating it.  However, I do wish it were a bit thinner in consistency, since I used it as a sauce rather than a dip.  Next time I want it as a sauce I may try normal plain yogurt (non-drained).

This was really good.  I used greek yogurt to avoid having to drain the regular yogurt.  This gave that nice thick texture. I really like the min in this.  It worked really well with some greek chicken wraps I made.  I made ahead of time so that it could sit for 24 hours to let the flavors blend. I think next time I may add more cucumber.

This was a great, super simple tzatziki sauce I made to go with souvlaki on a greek night. Definitely put in the mint - makes the dish. I had dill on hand so I added just a bit in there as well and it turned out great. I used a fairly fine grate on my cucumber because nothing is worse than hunks of it in what's supposed to be a creamy sauce. My guests couldn't stop eating it!!

Very tasty and close to what I would expect to get at a good Greek Restaurant. I used Greek Yougurt and added a little fresh dill. Yummy!

Just like restaurants.  Use greek yogurt and be sure to drain.  Fresh garlic is a must.  I used dill and mint.

this is perfect in the summer.  of all the recipes for tzatziki this is by far my favorite and using coffee filter is a fantastic suggestion!  I also love that most of the ingredients come straight from my garden

I LOVE this sauce!  I really enjoy it with my tabouli salad when we have greek night! 
If you don't already know, mint grows like a weed, if you like to cook greek food, do yourself a favor and add it to your herb garden.  I suggest a container for it because it is aggressive!

I strained the cucumber as recommended by other users and also use Liberte Mediterranee plain yogurt.  Using a good yogurt is key to making great tzatziki.  You don't have to strain this brand of yogurt.  I didn't add mint or black pepper, but did use a pinch of sea salt.  Will try mint next time.

wow! i've never made Tzatziki sauce before, but i absolutely loved this recipe! it tastes WAAY better than the stuff at restaraunts!  a couple of things i tweaked. i didn't have mint...fresh OR dried. what i DID have was a mint tea bag! i added a bit of that to the tzatziki sauce. i also only let my yogurt sit for maybe 45 minutes in coffee filters. i did however ring out my cucumer shreds quite thoroughly to make up for the yogurt liquid.  i followed another reviewer and added a bit of lemon juice and dill to the sauce. THEN i used all the same spices while frying up my chicken for fresh pitas!

This was excellent!  I was really impressed with the flavors. I also used greek yogurt and it was perfect.  I should mention that the different of chilling it first was huge.  At first when I tried it, before I chilled it I was dubious, but afterwords I was really impressed.

This is really good, I've made this recipe twice already. I do think the amount of pepper is a bit too much for Tzatziki sauce, at least for our tastes. I would recommend cutting back on the pepper and adding a bit more salt also. I used a teaspoon of dried mint, I didn't have any fresh, which worked out fine. I don't have cheesecloth, so I line my colander with coffee filters, place over a bowl and add the yogurt over the filters and place in the refrigerator for 4 hours. This works perfect!! The second time I made this, I was short on time and only allowed 2 1/2 hours to drain the yogurt, and this was a bit soupy. It's very important to let this drain the 4 hours for  perfect consistency. I would give this 5 stars, but the pepper is a bit to overwhelming and we didn't really taste any saltiness at all. I will make this again with those 2 minor changes, thanks for sharing :)

This is the best sauce.  I made it with the turkey and spinach burgers on this site!  I also use greek yogurt which saves time because it does not need to be strained.  Yummo!  Everyone loved it.

Very good recipe.  I didn't find it too tart, possibly because I didn't have time to drain regular yogurt so used Greek yogurt instead.

Not quite on par with versions I've had in restaurants - I actually think it probably needs a bit more cucumber.

Best mix of flavors of any of the tzatziki recipes I've tried. Good AS IS although many of the slight alterations in the comments are good, too. I like mine with a sprig of fresh dill.
No need to strain Greek yogurt. I did it all in the food processor in about ten minutes.

This tzatziki was not the best I've had, but the best that I have personally made. I used Greek yogurt, so I didn't have to strain it. I did press the shredded cucumber in a clean cloth to eliminate the excess juice and came out with a good constistency. I like my tzatziki a little more intense, so I added a few squirts of lemon juice. Did not use the mint leaf suggestion. Just played with the levels of ingredients until it was the way I like it. Looking forward to having this with a Greek meal!

I love this sauce! I used Greek yogurt and the food processor like other reviewers. I didn't have any mint so I didn't follow the recipe exactly but still turned out fantastic!

Awesome recipe, very good.  Another tip, while the yogurt is draining, mix all the other ingredients together, and let set for a while.  Before adding the yogurt, drain the liquid from the cucumber mixture, and even a thicker tzaziki.  The salt pulls out more of the liquid from the cucumber and garlic.

This was ok....for some reason, the pepper just seemed overwhelming to me. We don't usually cook with lots of pepper, so maybe that's why I found it overwhelming. Had the pepper been reduced, I may have enjoyed it more.

Very tasty! I only wanted to make about a cup or so, so I just improvised with the measurements of each ingredient, turned out tasty! Also, I didn't bother straining the yogurt (simply poured out some excess liquid before scooping into the bowl, because I was making this as a sauce for turkey burgers, rather than as a dip, so thickness wasn't what I was aiming for. After chilling for a couple of hours, it was just the right consistency for what I wanted!

Excellent - I used 16 oz Greek yogurt so no straining needed, substituted dill for the mint, added dash of lemon juice and a packet of splenda - very close to restaurant style tzatziki sauce. This was much better after 24 hours in the fridge.

The only thing I did differently was to add a splash of lemon juice.  Yum!  Make it ahead as it gets better with time.  At least a couple of hours or overnight if you can make it a day ahead.

Delicious.  We had this with Sean's Falafel.  I only drained the yogurt for about an hour (in a coffee filter) and the sauce wasn't runny at all.

Delicious & Easy!!

I used greek yogurt  so no straining was necessary, and a whole English, or hothouse cucumber (seedless). I grated the cucumbers on the largest side, and kept squeezing them with paper towels in order to get all the moisture out.

An excellent recipe.  It is VERY important to drain the yogurt and get all the liquid out of the cucumber, though, in order to obtain the proper consistency.

I served this with the Souvlaki recipe on this site served as gyros.  It was one of, if not THE best tzatziki sauce I've ever had.  Mine wasn't runny at all, but I was really diligent about draining my yogurt and cucumber.  Excellent recipe!

Good recipe, I thought it tasted a bit sour, but my husband who loves greek food said it tasted very authentic. I used it with the greek chicken recipe from this site and made homemade gyros.  I think it was maybe a bit too sour because of all of the lemon juice in the chicken marinade as well, I may try adding a tablespoon or two of honey to the next batch.

This is pretty good.  It tastes much like what I had in Greece - although I can't find Greek yogurt (which is awesome) at the supermarket.  I know it's available at better grocery stores and I'll find it and use it next time.

Excellent!!  What can I say we loved it.  I like it better than a lot of the sauces you get in restaurants even.  I forgot to press moisture out of the cucumbers but it still turned out great and I did not drain the yogurt either.  It kept well in the fridge and it disappeared quickly.  No wastage here!
Thank you for the great recipe.

It was OK, little too garlicky for me and I like garlic. Also, didn't much care for the mint, so would substitute fresh parsley for it.  Good base recipe but that's about all

Very good and tasty!  The first time I made it I just chopped the cucumber, this time (making it now), I am shredding it like the recipe says.  The chunks were too big when chopping it.

No one wanted me to try this receipe and kept insisting I try to buy a bottled sauce (couldn't find one).  I followed the receipe exactly except I used a non fat strained greed yogurt which allowed me to avoid the hours of prep time.  It came out perfect and now I get requests to make this sauce often!

this recipe was awesome!!! agreed with the reviewer who added 1/2 fresh lemon juice + a dash of splenda. Also I didnt have mint on hand so I used fresh dill. I am on a pure protein diet and chicken gets quite boring a la carte. This tzatziki sauce (made  with non-fat greek yogurt) is a nice accompiment to 'just chicken'. Thanks for posting.

The instructions are good for the yogurt and the cucumber etc. However, I thought the vinegar was too strong. I had to add yogurt to reduce the pungent taste of the vinegar.

Yummy! I've made this twice now. I used 1 1/2 tsp dried dill because I had no mint, only 1 cup of greek yogurt, and I added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Served it with the Spinach and Feta Turkey burgers off this site. So good!!

We JUST got back from Greece and I was already craving tzatziki! Have to say not the absolute best I've ever had (I've had some pretty amazing tzatziki) but I'd have to say pretty darn good and still worth 5 stars. I didn't have any cheesecloth (not sure what it is...) so I lined a colander with coffee filters and put it over a bowl for a few hours. This is a crucial step if you can't find authentic Greek yogurt! (which I couldn't) The real stuff is much thicker so straining the liquid out is important. Everyone loved it! Great dip for gyros, souvlaki, pita, etc.   A great way to make good souvlaki is to get a pita, use the "Greek Chicken" recipe submitted by Karen, a wedge of lemon, a few tomato slices, and a healthy dollop of this tzatziki! Voila, delish greek meal!

Very tasty.  Used some extra garlic as I always do in our recipes!  Made this with Jeanie's Falafel from the site and had an amazing meal.

I saved a ton of time and effort by just starting off with Greek yogurt.  I used Trader Joe's 0% fat Greek yogurt.  I was in a rush and just ended up dicing one clove of garlic...it was perfect the next day and my 6 year old told me that the combination of garlic naan (an Indian flatbread that I toasted in the toaster oven) and this tzatziki was the best dinner ever.  Who knew.

Great, classic recipie. Simple to do, might want to note it's really important to drain the yogurt AND the cucumber, which is full of water that will make the tzatziki runny. Nice.

This tzatziki sauce recipe was just okay in my opinion. We have a ton of fresh mint in our garden so I decided to try this but it tasted kind of off to me. The best tzatziki sauce recipe I have tried so far is "Yia Yia's tzatziki" from this site, it tasted so authentic. Thanks for the recipe though, it was a nice way to use some mint.

This tzatziki sauce is so wonderful.  If you take away the garlic the sauce turns into a nice yogurt salad!

Be VERY careful when scaling this recipe dowm: the amounts of salt and pepper remain way to high!!!  I didn't realized this and my tzatziki was way too peppery!!!  This being said, I'm sure this is still a wonderful recipe, however, when making this sauce I like to add a little lemon juice and dill and omit the mint.  I will definitly try this one again.

This was wonderful!  It reminded me of the Tzatziki we have at Christmas with my fiance's family.  I did add a little dill weed and garlic powder to it, but overall, it was fantastic!  Thank you for the great and easy recipe!

i don't know why, but this tasted NOTHING like the stuff I love to eat with gyros... it was runny like everyone said, but there was something so bitter about it. I didn't even eat it..what a waste of food. :(

I wish I could give this a 10!! It was awesome. I forgot to pick up cheesecloth so I had to improvise using a small strainer and bowl for the yougurt. It removed a good deal of the water. I can't stop eating this and it made my kitchen smell so yummy. I made this with Peppy's Pita Bread and Marinated Greek Chicken Kabobs. I felt like I was at a greek restuarant!!

I think the recipe called for WAY too much salt.  Next time I will cut it in half, and I will also omit the pepper.  I'm a big pepper fan, but somehow the flavor did not go with the Tzatziki I remember from my trip to Greece 2 years ago.

This sauce was excellent on gyros!  I just added 3 times as much pepper as called for....it was fabulous.  And I can see dipping vegetables in the remaining sauce.  Thanks Brenda for sharing such a great recipe!

Good sauce Brenda.  I skipped on straining the yogurt and left out the garlic.  I too think the mint made this really good. Thanks for sharing.

So good, especially when I use our home-made yogurt! If you don’t drain the yogurt and cucumber and add a bit of lemon juice, it also makes great salad dressing.

Good recipe, have made it with and without mint. Delicious and easy. Have some chilling in my fridge now.

Oh, and you don't really have to spend 3 hours letting the yogurt drain if you don't want to. I've done it both ways and they were both good.

Good basic recipe, but didn't have the dill that is in most recipes.  I added 2 tbsp fresh dill, used greek yogurt, less mint and 3 cloves garlic.... so  basically I made something different!!

I added the lemon juice that was suggested in another review and it added a wonderful fresh flavor to the recipe. I used this on Greek nachos that I had just seen on tv and it was a wonderful addition to the homemade pita chips, fresh vegetables, and feta.

Love this sauce! I use greek yogurt, because the texture is thicker and richer. Also I use dill weed instead of mint. I dont shred the cucumber, I dice it into small pieces so there is some crunch. Refridgerate it a few hours before serving to allow the garlic flavor to kick in. Excellent!

Good, but next time I will use more yogurt and greek yogurt instead. Straining through the cloth was difficult, but then I'd never done that before. I put more mint in than it called for, and next time I'll do a bit of dill too. I used this on goat meat gyros.

Great recipe. I only changed one thing, I used Greek Yogurt that eliminates having to strain the water from the yogurt.

I think this came out well, and I added it to salads and sandwiches too.  I used greek yogurt and I blended it til smooth.  I might use a little less mint next time but I added more than the recipe called for.  Great for my lamb and chicken gyros!! :)

I made this exactly as the recipe says.  I used Greek yogurt, and drained it for a couple of hours and it turned out really thick.I think next time I won't drain it so much and I'll cut back on the mint a little (like half).  Otherwise it was really tasty and went well with the Traditional Gyro Meat (delicious!!) and Peppy's Pitas (perfect)--both of which I found on this site.  Definitely will make again!!

I have used this recipe twice and this second time, I tweaked the recipe by reducing the mint to about 6 fresh leaves and also added 2 tsps of vinegar.  The lesser amount of mint goves it just a very light hint of mint.  These are ideas I got from another recipe and I think the vinegar kicked it up a notch.

Very good. I missed a fresh squeeze of lemon, so I added that. Salted the cucumber before draining, it draws out the water a little better.

This was so incredibly quick and delicious. To save time, I used an English cucumber and shredded it whole in the food processor (no peeling or deseeding needed). The Greek yogurt that I found was extremely thick, so I didn't even think about straining it. Added fresh lemon juice, and it was ready to go.  If you're in a bind,eat right away (very flavorful regardless).

Made this to go with the spicy lamb burgers from this site and it was amazing. There was nothing left as everyone was scooping the remaining sauce with corn chips.   Now that Greek yoghurt is so popular, you can use it (I love Stonyfield Oikos) and skip the straining step. I am going to try it next time with goat's milk Greek yoghurt from my farmer's market.

Very good and was even better the next day! I used whole fat Greek yogurt and a little less mint (only because I did not have enough) and it turned out great. I served on gyro meat with pita and it was wonderful! This is a keeper. :)

This is a great recipe.  I lived in the Tampa Bay area and would travel to Tarpon Springs to eat authentic greek food at least 3 times a year.  I recommend not only straining the yogurt, but also the cucumber at the same time.    Additionally, I add dill instead of the mint for a traditional greek flavor.

My Husband said this is the best sauce he ever had. And we live in NY where there's Greek restaurants near us everywhere. However, this tasted like the way the Russians make the Tzatziki Sauce, because I've had Russian versions of Gyros and those were the only ones that tasted just like it. I gave it 5 stars because even though i thought it was too spicy, my husband thought it was the best sauce he's had in his life. (I altered this recipe by muddling the garlic with a little olive oil-might have given it the strong flavor)

I definitly did not appreciate the lemon I added!!! Made it again without the lemon and the black pepper and it was fantastic. I also used greek yogurt that I didnt bother draining but squeezed the life out of my shredded cucumber. After it was all mixed up I realized I wouldnt appreciate it being chunky, so I ran it through my food processor until it was semi-smooth. Mmmmmmm!

This is great! I used dried mint, because I had it on hand, and used low-fat sourcream instead of yogurt. I had it with falafel, but it would be great as dip too!

As written it gets a four but add a squeeze or three of fresh lemon and this is a five!

I made this with the "Traditional gyro meat" recipe from this site.  I loved this sauce. I thought it was simple and tasted extremely good. I used whole milk organic yogurt and placed it in a kitchen towel in a strainer over a bowel.  It was only in the refrigerator for about 1 1/2 hours and it strained a lot of the liquid from the yogurt. In fact, I think the sauce was a little too thick and next time I will probably not squeeze out the cucumbers as much as I did.  I probably used 2 Tbs. of fresh mint instead of 1/4 cup. I will definitely make again!

This was good, but a little bit too minty us. I followed the recipe exactly and served it on gyros. It stored well in the fridge and the leftovers were really good to dip carrots and tortilla chips in. I also spread some on a pita with sliced tomatoes and feta...yumm!

This recipe is GREAT!  There is nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day than the taste of this cool cucumber sauce!  The flavors blend perfectly together - I was skeptical about the mint at first, but it really adds a little something that makes this Tzatziki stand out above the others!  Excellent recipe!

Pretty good, but needed a bit more flavor, so I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a little bit of finely chopped onion. Yummy!

I just got back from Greece yesterday where I have been eating this every single days for the last few days.  In making my own, I salted the cucumber, drained the yogurt in a strainer, then put the salted cucumber in the strainer, squeezed as much juice from the cucumber as i could.  I was afraid it would taste funny because the yogurt was fat free - but it was absolutley great!

Yummy!  We're overseas so authentic greek food is very common but every once in a while I prefer to have it at home.  This recipe is very close to what they serve at the restaurant nearby. I use an english cucumber, to avoid seeds, and German plain whole-milk yogurt becuase it is a bit thicker. To cut down on the waiting time I layer paper towels and gently squeeze out the moisture.  I also use minced garlic and add a drizzle of olive oil.  Great recipe...

Very good, but a little heavy on the mint. Great garlic flavor. I also made this using half of the mint and some fresh dill, was more to our taste. Great recipe!

This sauce is fantastic!  It is way closer to authentic tasting tzatziki sauce then any of the sauces that call for dill instead of mint.  This was absolutely perfect.  Rather then shredding the cucumbers though I minced them (personal preference).

Taste was great but I'm not sure about shredding the cucumber. I might mince it next time. I used the coffee filter technique and pressed the excess of water out of the cucumber but it's still very watery. Probably my fault because I didn't wait enough!

This sauce was wonderful.  I did use the cheese cloth and was amazed at the amount of water that left.  I loved the recipe as it is, no changes.  I will make it again the next time I make the souvlaki recipe from this site.

Superb.  I made this with fresh mint, but I am eager to try out dill the next time.  Draining the yogurt on cheesecloth is absolutely essential in achieving the correct texture.

Very tasty. The only thing I will do next time I make it is I would use less garlic. Yummy was the response from the kids.  The whole family liked it.  Will definately serve this again.
