I made this recipe for a co-workers B-day and then again for my roommates b-day. You really have to grease and flour the pan or it will stick terribly!! It was moist and wonderful, very easy to make!!! Loved the cream cheese center. I also decided to drizzle some carmel sauce on top of it just to make it good and rich (like it wasn't already!) and a scooop of ice cream.  It was really very gooey and wonderful!
I used only 1 bowl and 1 baking pan...very easy to make, let it set for a bit before turning out on a dish.

This is the best German Chocolate cake!!! Everyone loves it and it's much simpler that the traditional one.I have never used the egg though in the cream cheese mixture.My recipe didn't call for one.Just be sure to drop the filling by spoonfulls and don't spread it or it won't sink into the cake. Also I don't use all the cake mix when making the cake cause it can overflow the pan.Enjoy! You gotta try it!

Second year in a row I have made this cake for our Octoberfest party. It is easy and amazing! Someone brought a bakery 4 layer German chocolate cake and mine was gone and everyone said this one was better. Just drop the cream cheese mixture right on the cake and don't bother spreading it around. It comes out perfect!

I made this for my husband's birthday, since it is his favorite kind of cake. I have never liked German Chocolate Cakes.  This one is FABULOUS!!!  The icing is unreal...I'll never go back to the canned stuff.  I toasted the coconut before adding it, and everyone raved about it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was tasty!  The cake needs to be left in the pan for awhile though.  I would suggest at least an hour.  If you flip it out (to reveal the coconut and pecans) too early, the cream cheese mixture will run everywhere.

I made this recipe as a low fat version using egg beaters and applesauce and low fat cream cheese. It was still wonderful

ok-this was an easy recipe, but it looks so unfinish out of the pan. the coconut and pecans sink into the cake-you can hardly see them at all. it just looks like a bare cake that needs frosting. the cream cheese filling spilled over and you can see it from the bottom of the cake. i wanted to give this to a friend, but it looks just sooooo bad. i hope it tastes good.

This cake was very rich and delicious! I added chocolate chips to the sugar/butter mixture, and used milk chocolate frosting. BUT...I baked for an hour and the middle was not baked at all, it overflowed and spilled ALL over the oven. I put it back in the oven for an extra half hour and it was great. I used two 9 inch round baking dishes, so maybe that was my problem? Other than the mess, it was fantastic!

The cake was very tasty, but I'm renaming it to Volcano Cake! I used a glass 9x13 pan like the recipe called for, and tried to spread the cream cheese around to the required 1" from the edges, but did not realize it was going to overflow so much! I should have taken the time to read the reviews or I might have had a clue! Now I get to clean the oven! But, the thing was very tasty and I will make it again, using more than one pan! I took it to work for my supervisor's birthday, and everyone loved it.

We made this yesterday and I didn't think it was good at all, the top was dry and the only good part was the white stuff that was on the bottom and it stuck to the pan!!! I will never make this cake again!!!

I keep reading the recipe over and over again to see if i did anything wrong, and I can't see that I did. The only thing I did not follow word for word was I was short a half a C of confectioner's sugar. I can't see how the omission of 1/2 C of confectioner's sugar could cause this massive a failure. It's ridiculous, the coconut toasted fine, but the 'frosting' didn't migrate downward as I assumed it would (like a dump cake). Cooked an extra 20 minutes on top of the original 60 and it's still not cooked through, it looks absolutely disgusting and doesn't taste too fantastic. Has sort of like a cream cheese 'swirl' instead of any icing. Would not make again, no more cutting corners or using cake mixes. Very disappointed that I have nothing to bring to my friend tonight.

This was a real hit at a family function we had.  Everyone loved it and said they liked it better then the traditional German Chocolate cake.  The only thing I didn't like was it spilling all over in my oven.  I would probably not use all of the cake mix or all of the cream cheese.  Other then that...it is a keeper!

very good,  followed the recipe help and separated the two parts of the dough.  patted one in and chilled and rolled out the top piece.  SUPER sweet, but loved by everyone who had it.

This cake came out looking terrible and when I tried to cut it fell apart and made a horrible mess.
