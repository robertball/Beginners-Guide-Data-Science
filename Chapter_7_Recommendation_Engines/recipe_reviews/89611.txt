We tried this recipe a few days ago and weren't too thrilled. The sauce wasn't creamy like we expected, at all and really wasn't very flavorful. The recipe sounded delicious, and we followed it to a tee, but we were less impressed with the outcome.

i only made the sauce and did not bake the salmon. i also used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. the sauce came out amazing and was a hit at the christmas eve dinner, but i had to cook it down much longer and had to add some flour to thicken the sauce. overall it was great but the cooking time provided in the recipe was not long enough.

The outcome was just not tasteworthy at all unfortunately.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe, I strained the white wine reduction instead of a puree, and made a roux then added milk, after it thickens, added the wine reduction and reduced the poaching liquid and added it.  The sauce stayed thick and served with steamed asparagus around the edge of plate....Delicious!

I thought the yogurt and sour cream together in one recipe would be weird and it was. I wasn't too fond of this recipe.
