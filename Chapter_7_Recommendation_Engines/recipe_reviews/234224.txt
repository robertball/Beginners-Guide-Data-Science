A veggie burger to sink your teeth into. I used a squirt or two of Sriracha for the garlic (didn't have any on hand). I needed the whole 1/2 cup of chickpea flour.  Next time I'm going to add some mashed chickpeas, I couldn't help thinking they'd go well mixed in. I made 7 smaller sized burgers rather than 2 large and used a variety of cheeses in addition to the Swiss. Thank you for the recipe.
