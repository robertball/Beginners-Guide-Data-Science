My family loves this recipe. My kids devoured it. My youngest son has the leftovers for breakfast. I thouht it was a little dry the first time. So I always make a little extra sauce for the top so the noodles don't dry out. Excellent!I also omit the mushrooms and olives. They aren't even missed. (My family isn't big on mushrooms an olives.)

I used mixed veggies instead of just peas and corn and used a bit more sauce and it came out reallly good! Good casserole to be devoured by alot of people real fast!

This recipe was pretty good, chock full of good food, like peas and corn. It was pretty popular at my New Year's party and it grows on my husband the more he eats it. However, this is more of a beef casserole with lasagne noodles than a lasagne. There's no ricotta cheese, so ditch the side dishes you'd use with a regular lasagne. I put aluminum foil over the top to keep the top layer from getting dry and poured some extra tomato sauce on it . Not dry at all. The layer of cheese on top is a great touch.

the instructions for this recipe should include the words "Do Not Make This Under ANY Circumstances".  the instructions include a note to not place the cheese on top until AFTER you cook it all for 20 min. this makes the top layer of noodles so hard they can not be eaten.  As for popularity, this ranks a big goose egg.

I made this for a potluck dinner at work.  Lots of people liked it -- I have to say that I thought it was missing something.  I am not sure if I will make it again.

I made this as is, and it lasted me for a few days. It was fairly tasty, but was nothing spectacular. I thought it was a little odd to have the peas and corn inside a lasgna-like dish, but it grew on me a little. Also, the top noodle did get a little bit over-cooked and dry on top.
