The plum preserves and the horseradish were fabulous together, however, I did add a couple of other ingredients to make this glaze really amazing. Dijon mustard and brown sugar did the trick. I scored my ham after two hours in the oven and then applied the glaze and basted for another hour and a half. To keep the bottom of your pan from getting burned from the glaze, just add some OJ and water. While the ham was resting I put all the drippings and the rest of the glaze in a sauce pan, brought it to a boil and thickend with cornstarch. Incredibly delicious!

I loved everyone's reviews & I used bottled plums, pitted them, it took two, sliced & crushed them. This brought the ingredients to a half cup. I also used a couple of tablespoons of crushed pineapple & the juice of both, just a about a tablespoon of each. I used a tablespoon of horseradish, dijon mustard & apricot preserves. I scored the ham & added the orange juice right when it went into the oven & the glaze the last 30 - 40 minutes & saved the extra for dipping. It was deelish! Yeah! Thanks everyone! :)

Worked out pretty well for a whole ham someone had given us. Instead of plum jelly, I used plum sauce and just mixed it together with the fresh horseradish. Brushed it on and let it bake. Went over very well with everyone at our Christmas dinner.
