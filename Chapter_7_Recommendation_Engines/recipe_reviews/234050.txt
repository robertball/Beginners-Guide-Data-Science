I used this recipe my very first time making scones and they came out perfect- they had that light scone texture and were slightly sweet and maple-y! Very easy recipe to follow and delicious with no modifications! Thank you!

These scones are delicious, moist and tender; love the toasted walnuts. I substituted 1/4 cup whole wheat flour just for a little extra flavor. Seemed like the recipes made too much topping, but it was just about perfect once the scones expanded while baking.

These had a really good, mild flavor, which is what I like in a scone. Because I didn't have real maple syrup, I added a bit of maple extract to butter syrup. I might add a little cinnamon the next time I make this recipe. I had to bake these about 25 minutes, but they were worth the wait!

Very good and will make again. I forgot to add the baking powder, but came out just fine. I also did not knead since I pressed into the scone pan. I loved the roasted nuts! I used a scone pan and baked for 20 minutes. Next time I will likely add more maple syrup, it needs a bit more maple flavor for me. Thank you for sharing!

These were okay, nothing exceptional. Not really a maple flavor even though I used pure maple syrup.  I wasn't impressed by the topping, ended up adding more brown sugar because it was bland and too flour-y.  Some cinnamon in it might help. Personally, I'll just be moving on.  Thanks, anyway.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were quite tasty. A couple of notes: I found there was way too much topping. I might cut this by 1/3 to 1/2 next time. I used one cup of AP flour and one cup of WW flour, which give them a nice texture. Also, I ended up baking these for closer to 40 minutes. The inside was just too gooey at 20 minutes (maybe I added too much milk; I don't know), so watch the time closely and adjust accordingly. Overall, I am quite happy with these.
