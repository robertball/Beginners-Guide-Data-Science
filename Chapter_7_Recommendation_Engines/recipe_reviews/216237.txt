This is a good base recipe.  The only seasoning comes from the picante sauce and the lime. 

I spent a lil time doctoring it up after it was made to get it to pop for me and my husband.  What I did was add in sourcream, red pepper flakes, cumin, sea salt, cheese and tabasco.  I then warmed it up a lil bit... and that made it pop for us.  If I had some jalapeno I would have chopped that up to add more texture.  

I willl make this again, but with the above modifications to serve on the Frito Scoopers.  

I hope that this helps the next person.

Delicious!  I made a large batch on the spur of the moment and didn't have enough lime.  So, I used one lime plus a fresh lemon and it was fabulous!  I also added some salt and pepper to bring out the flavor of the beans.

This is wonderful. Even my picky eaters liked it and asked for seconds.

This is a nice, easy recipe, but I recommend you vary the salsa a bit to your own taste (we mixed two), and add more flavor for an adult audience. Nice 'n easy, though! Kids loved it.

This is so good even my husband, who dosen't really like bean dips, loved it. The lime flavor really adds a lot. I added just a little chipotle powder to kick up the spice. What a tasty way to serve black beans!

Easy, quick, basic recipe and everyone loves it! Using fresh lime instead of concentrate makes the flavor really perk up! I also add some fresh cilantro.

I loved this. Never would have thought of that, but honestly loved. And versatile! Great dip, burrito filling, side dish...or I threw it into my vegan family's taco salad. Delish. I will use this again and soon.

This recipe is way better than I thought it would considering the number of ingredients.  I am guessing it's all about the picante/salsa that you use.  It was fantastic.  The lime gave it a nice tang.

Thanks, I made this as written except I added extra salsa.  It doesn't taste like hummus, but it's a good dip.
