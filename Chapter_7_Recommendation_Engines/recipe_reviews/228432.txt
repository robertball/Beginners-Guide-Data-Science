they turned out great. You can't tell that they are healthy for you at all. My picky 5 year old loved them. I added cinnamon and allspice and nutmeg to the muffin mix, and oats to the crumb topping. light and fluffy. will make them again. I added my photo!!

These came out really nicely...I had to use more applesauce and less bananas because I ran out. They are really sweet and dont even taste "healthy"! Even though I used whole whaeat flour.

I used two bananas, omitted the agave syrup and added a handful of chocolate chips.  I added too much applesauce to the crumble topping so it was more like a paste on top of the muffins. They turned out moist and delicious.  Next time I will make the crumble topping properly.

Such an awesome recipe! I had quite a few bananas to get rid of, so I just doubled the recipe. I threw some leftover shredded coconut into the batter, and added oats to give the crumble more substance. These came out so moist and delicious, it was hard to eat just one!

These were quite good, especially for a reduced-fat muffin.  They are much lighter tasting than a traditional banana muffin/bread.  They were a little chewy but not so much as other reduced-fat muffins.  I did not have agave nectar so I used one tbsp. of runny honey.  This seemed to work fine.  It was sweet but the sweetness did not overwhelm the banana taste.   My kids love bananas but my 14-month old seem to think this muffin was too chewy and wouldn't eat very much of it (but he is not a huge fan of bread.)  My daughter said she liked it but only ate half of it (which may mean nothing since she is an extremely picky eater.)   My kids may not be crazy about them, but I really liked them.

Perfect!  The recipe worked really well without changes (although I substituted the flour for all-purpose gluten free).  If you want to add a gluten free oat substitute for the crumble, you can use quinoa flakes for an almost identical texture (I'll try that next time, although the crumble from the recipe worked well).  Thank You!  My son has digestive issues and this made him so happy.

These turn out great!! I did make some changes to make them a tad healthier.  
I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup of almond flour, 1/2 cup quick oats.  I used a fresh duck egg instead of a chicken egg. I halved the brown sugar and I didn't do the topping to help cut calories....but I did add the cinnamon to the batter.  I also added 3 fresh cranberries to each muffin for a little extra flavor.  
They taste amazing!!

I used the topping for the Dietetic Banana Muffins submitted by Bridget.  It was delicious. Don't fill the muffin tin cups too full because it will boil over.

I made this today.  Delicious!  I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and instead of the egg, I used egg replacer to make this vegan.  My Husband said it was "freakin good."  I will definitely make this again!  Great, healthy, tasty recipe.

Good basic recipe.  I thought the 1 tablespoon of agave made the batter a little too sweet, so I added 1/4 cup of chopped unsweetened cherries.  I substituted 1/4 cup of egg beater for 1 egg.  I switched out some white flour for whole wheat, but next time will try oat flour.  I did not use the crumb mixture so instead I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  And, just for the fun of it, I added hemp hearts.  My husband really enjoyed the muffins.

Delicious!! I used cinnamon applesauce and a handful of oatmeal. Came out very good. Happy I was able to use up my bananas in a healthy recipe.

When I made this, the crumb topping became a filling when cooked.  I am going to do it again and wait till the muffins are almost done and then add the crumb topping.  Either way, my husband loves the recipe.
