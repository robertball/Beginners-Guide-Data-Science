Simple and tasty. Be careful on the seasoning. Between the olives and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt, it had plenty! 1/4 teaspoon might be a good place to start.

I think this is really tasty.  Be aware that this tastes like an olive hummus, rather than a hummus with a traditional tahini taste, so I consider this more a recipe for a specialty hummus than for a basic hummus.  That being said, this was a hit with my family and friends.  We enjoyed the rich, Mediterranean olive taste, and I enjoyed snacking on the leftovers at work knowing that it was a relatively low-calorie version of hummus.  The olives are cheaper than tahini, too.  I think I'll definitely make this again -- for basic snacking, I like that it gives a hummus flavor with less calories.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the hummus recipe.  I altered the recipe by adding two roasted, red pepper strips, cayenne pepper and used green and black olives.  I think it is a good base hummus recipe for anyone who likes to add other God-made things to their foods.  :)

I LOVE hummus, and this is a really great basic recipe. Personally, I'm not a friend of olives, so I left them out, and I bumped up the amount of garlic to 4 cloves minimum (dude, hummus is ALL ABOUT garlic!), and it's excellent every time. My husband raves whenever I make it. ;)

I looove this hummus!  I needed a good hummus recipe that didn't require tahini, and this is it!  I eliminated the olives, added a bit more garlic and about half a little jar of roasted red peppers.  It was DELICIOUS, and there are so many variations you could make on this.  I'll never eat store-bought again!

What have I been spending $3.99 on tiny tubs of hummus for???  Had no idea how easy it would be to make this - thank you so much - delicious!  I can't wait to try my favorite variations i.e. roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, etc... YUM!

Very Good! I used a few sprigs of fresh cilantro and a few sprinkles of dried basil. I like to save and add 1-2 T. of juice from the beans and cut back on the oil a bit. I added less garlic because I was afraid it would be overpowering by the next day.

this is a great recipe for hummus, I was so afraid not to use tahini and not get the measurements "just right" but i made some awesome hummus today thanks to this recipe!! I used black olives (left overs from last night) and a dash of everything else.  Its a great basic recipe to add to! Thanks!

This is tasty, and the olives are a good substitute for tahini which can be quite expensive.  I added extra garlic, basil and cilantro for my personal taste.  It was very thick so I added a little water bit by bit until it was the consistency I wanted.  It was fantastic with my homemade pita chips and raw carrots.

This was really yummy. I did add more garlic, and less salt, but other then that it was perfect. I love it as a dip with carrots and bell peppers.

I hate keeping tahini around because i don't use it for anything else. This is a great hummus recipe without tahini! I made one batch as is, and another batch without the olives but leaving everything as is, and I preferred the one without olives. I got a smoother, creamier consistency.

Not impressed.  Not sure what I did wrong, I made it exactly to the recipe, but I was underwhelmed.  Don't find it "zesty" or "light".  Maybe add'l lemon juice or some cayenne pepper would help things.  Consistency was thick, and it lacked pizazz for me.  :(

Love this hummus. Like another reviewer suggested I left out the olives and increased the garlic. I also increased both the basil and cilantro adding them as I processed and tasting inbetween. Love this recipe!

This was awesome.  Everyone that has tried it loves it.  I have changed it a bit sometimes to include roasted red pepper and cayenne pepper for some spice.  Great Hummus recipe.

Great recipe!!!  I had only some pepper stuffed olives and they turned out to be great!!!   They enhanced flavours and the red colour was absolutely brilliant.   I wanted something to spread on my bread and it tops all I love (cheese, mayo etc.)! Will do it over and over

I omitted the olives and doubled the garlic. A+ stuff! I haven't had hummus in years and I had some chickpeas to use up. Thanks a bunch! I'll be having a lot of pita! PS - A dash of cumin MAKES this!

I really liked this hummus recipe, however, I did think that the garlic was overpowering...so much so, that I added an additional can of garbanzo beans, hoping that it would dilute the garlic flavor. For me (and I love garlic), it was still too garlicky tasting. However, everyone at my party loved it. Maybe my tastebuds are too sensitive to garlic, perhaps?

Great! This recipe was perfect for me since I dont' care for the tahini taste in most hummus recipes. Added about 3 heaping tablespoons of chopped garlic, lemon juice to taste ( i like a citrus kick), and a few sprigs on cilantro. Actually, i think the cilantro really makes this recipe great. Took about 5 minutes. Will make again soon!!

Great hummus recipe!  really doesn't need any added salt, since the olives make it salty enough.  Can't go wrong with this one!

I really enjoyed this hummus!  Made just as is except no cilantro(YUK) and the flavour was exceptional!!  Sort of hard to process in my mini food processor, but that is my own fault...Awesome taste!!

This Hummus is fantastic.  I made it in my blender (food processor didn't make it fine enough), and added a 1/2 can of black olives.  Made for a very rich and delicious hummus!

Fast and easy, as I had no tahini on hand but unfortunately I didn't like the taste of this recipe.  Perhaps because of the olives...but still gave it 3 stars for ease of the recipe...and I love trying new things and I also love ANY olive!  I was sad that I didn't like this one so much.

As I am not an Olive Hummus fan I left out the olives and added a jalapeño instead.  I also didn't have fresh basil so a pinch of dried was used.  I thought it was tasty, and a decent hummus.  The texture seemed off to me... not as smooth (like the store brand) that I was hoping for.  My father however LOVED it.  I made a batch and it was gone in 20 minutes! I will definitely make this again, but will play with it to see if I can get a smoother more pureed texture.

Fabulous! I love the green olives and so did my kids.  Only used 1 clove garlic and it was just right. I did add 2 T of olive oil and 2T of juice drained off of the garbanzos.  Will definitely be making this again, will be great to make and take to the beach for a snack.

I made this recipe to go alongside a Mediterranean stew w pita bread.  It was easy and delicious. I found it to be a lighter version of store bought or restaurant hummus.   I will definitely make it again!

great and simple! we don't use salt anymore and also ok if you don't have cilantro- even better would be to add black kalamata olives with the spanish or just kalamata- but annoying to pit them yourself but very worth it if you have the time

delish!  i added a bit more olive oil (not sure how much) to get more of a creamy texture.  i didn't have olives, but it was very tasty nonetheless.

Fantastic!! I will never buy hummus again. Easy to customize to your own tastes. I've added various things, all with success: sundried tomatoes, red pepper, kalamata olives. I also like the "raw" texture of mashing the ingredients together with a fork instead of using a food processor.

So easy and great taste, but did modify it to fit my pantry. First tip about hummus, de-skin the garbanzo beans, makes for a better consistency. Add about a dozen queen pimento stuffed olives and the same amount of jumbo pitted black olives. Added one clove garlic, chopped in the processor. Also a teaspoon cumin. Omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any, and viola! Chopped and grinded in the food processor to get the right smoothness. So tasty!

A little dry so I added more water and a few drops of sesame oil.  Didn't have cilantro so used parsley.  Tripled the garlic because I love garlic!  Just had to puree the heck out of it, other than that great!

Very good!  This is my 3rd attempt at hummus and the best by far!  I followed the recipe with the following modifications:  didn't have any fresh basil, added 1 tbsp of tahini, used probably closer to a half cup of the olives and added a tablespoon or two of the garbanzo bean juice to smooth it out.  I also did not remove the shells from the beans and it has a great texture!  Highly recommended!  Per another reviewers comment, this is a more gourmet version of hummus and definitely not your basic flavor but wonderful all the same!

Well I totally changed this recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients. I left out the olives, garlic, and cilantro and substituted the closest thing I had: about a tsp. of onion powder. It turned out fabulous any way and my hubby now wants to open a hummus shop after tasting it.

I made this for a party and everyone raved about it. (I doubled the recipe and omitted the olives.) Super easy to make, though I would do early or the day before so all of the flavors have a chance to really come out.
Yummy!!!!

I've made a lot of hummus, and this recipe is excellent (with a little help, of course).  I added 1/4 c. cilantro and no parsley, lots more garlic.  It's VERY salty when you first make it, but if you let it sit for a day and serve it the next, it is fabulous.

This was my first time making hummus - it turned out very well, although I did add come Cheyanne (sp?) pepper and black pepper to give it a bit more bite.

I thought this hummus was a bit bland alone.  But with the addition of more lemon juice, it was quite pleasing on a whole wheat pita.  I used regular olives and fresh cilantro but I only had dried basil.  The basil gave it a definite Italian taste.  I am adding this to my rotation.

Ridiculously easy to make, even if you don't have a food processor.  I managed with a potato masher to mash the peas, and a hand-mixer for the rest.  I'm sure a spoon would have sufficed.  

I feel that it needs more lemon juice, can't have too much lemon juice, and instead of adding salt I poured in some kalamata olive brine for moisture, salt, and flavour.  

The beauty of this recipe is that it's so easy to modify to taste.  I'm tempted to sit here spooning it out of the tub, unaccompanied!

Easy hummus recipe and delicious. Only addition I made was to add diced tomatoes and green chiles. Gave it a great taste and the texture wasn't as thick. Next time I'm adding a can of black beans. So much fun to make!

I felt it needed a little tahini(added large tablespoon to the recipe) to feel like real hummas. I thought this was very good! I doubled the recipe and so may have used a little more basil and cilantro leaves.

Tried this with some adaptations-black olives instead of manzanilla; balsamic vinegar rather than lemon juice-because I didn't have the green olives or lemon juice. Thought I would miss the tahini...nope! Very good; thanks for sharing.

Love this hummus recipe!  I made it last year. My hubby and I ate all of it in one sitting. This time I did not add any salt or pepper but added more olive oil.
However, I do recommend only using a food processor. That worked better than the blender.  Went from blender to food processor. Lesson learned! :)

I didn't have olives on hand, so I added a littttttle extra chick peas and used 5 cloves of garlic because someone reviewed that hummus is all about garlic :)  Next time I think I will just use 4 cloves because it was a little bit too strong.  I also didn't have cilantro, so I just added an extra sprinkle of basil.  This was GREAT!  If you like it a little creamier, add an extra drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.

YUM!! love the green olives in hummus! I added a little more lemon juice and about 1/3 cup of tahini paste (need to use it up and I've always put it in my hummus) Why don't I make hummus more often? I absolutely love it!! Made my own Zesty Pita Chips too-wonderful!!

So easy! And lower fat. I definitely am going to try this making my own garbanzo beans instead of canned because it really affects the flavor. I also felt there was a bit too much lemon juice in this recipe for my liking.

Yum!! Hubby & I loved it and I found it super easy to make. I made this for my birthday dinner and served it with Pita Bread, Greek Salad III (found on this site) and a meat & cheese patter with: provolone, mozzarella, muenster, salami, & prosciutto, olives & artichoke hearts. For dessert I served the White Chocolate Fruit Tart (also found on this site). It was awesome!! Everything I wanted for the meal a great way to celebrate my birthday.

Light, delicious, fresh--this bean puree was wonderful.  If you're a fan of Mediterranean flavors, this stuff will thrill you!

Really easy and very good, even without the tahini.  I left out the basil but did use cilantro and it gave it a nice, fresh taste.

I love this recipe for hummus-- the flavor is great.  Any suggestions to help get the texture smooth like store-bought varieties?  I've experimented with the portions of liquid, and tried blenders and food processors but can't seem to break down the chickpeas quite enough.

I like this hummus recipe! It was easy and I had all ingredients on hand. The only olives I have were green olives stuffed with jalapenos. It really gave it a good flavor and very spicy which I like. I will definitely make again.

Really Tasty!  I recently bought some hummus from the local grocery store and was not too impressed.  I had always wanted to make hummus on my own, and I finally did.  Followed this recipe and it was great.  Really recommend it!

Holly, I gotta give you props.  This was so easy and delicious!!!  I just made it for a NYE party and was so pleased about how cheap and easy it is to make.   I made one version the "original" recipe, and I made one version with jalapeno and cayenne pepper.  I omitted olives in both versions as I don't really like them.  The hummus is lemony, garlicky, and perfectly balanced.... good as in any Lebanese restaurant.  I will never buy store-bought again.  Thanks!

This is my boyfriend's favorite appetizer. And it is so easy to make.  I top it with the mediterranian flavored Feta cheese. We like to serve it with toasted pita bread.

This was one of the easiest hummus recipes i ever used, no tahini!! everybody in my home loves hummus, and now i have the best recipe ever!! I left the pimentos in the green olives, and because we are watching our weight, and sodium intake i didn't add any salt or pepper and it was still delicious!! THANK YOU!! 5 stars!!

I added about a teaspoon of Asian chili paste (sambal olek) and used all cilantro (no basil).  Delicious variation on an already wonderful recipe!

Fabulous!  I omitted the olives and extra salt/pepper (canned garbanzos already have salt in them), added 3 tbsp of lemon juice instead of 2, and was generous with the cilantro.  It was perfect!  Thanks!

This recipe rocks! I added a smidge more of my favorite ingredients, like garlic and basil, and even threw in some cayenne pepper to "kick it up a notch" (as Emeril would say).  Great recipe.  Thanks Holly!

I think I added a bit too much basil, (serves me right for eyeballing it and not measuring!) but I thought it was a very unique tasting hummus. I'll make this again (but I'll make sure to measure the basil!)

Mmmm....this was tasty, but I did make changes. We did not have green olives so I used black. I left out the lemon juice as I am getting tired of the tangy taste in hummus. Maybe that is traditional, I don’t really know. I doubled the recipe because I cook dried garbanzo beans then freeze in 1.5 cup batches, which is 2 cans. Then added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp fresh ground ancho chili, 1/4 tsp fresh ground cumin. I tried to give it a more Mexican vibe with the black olives. If you like heat, then cayenne would go great here. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I love this wonderful dip! I could eat it on its own, it's that good.  Extra garlic and/or spice can easily be added if extra kick is wanted.

I love this. I made it without salt and no olives because I'm on a restricted diet but one reminded it. I made it a second time and mixed it with a homemade salsa and I still love it.

My daughter and I really enjoy this hummus recipe.  She only likes my home made hummus (this recipe) and not the versions we've tried from the store.  It does have an olive taste but it's delicious.  I like to add a couple teaspoons of sugar to the recipe.  It adds to the flavour somehow.

I used jalapeño stuffed olives and also thru in a tomatillo. I love this humus because there's no tahini (??) in it. Also whipped it up in my nutribullet using my smaller sized jar. Capped it and enjoyed for the next few days w beer and pretzels.

Made this with minimal changes (left out the salt, mostly b/c of the chips we were eating them with, used some of the chickpea liquid per another review and used dried cilantro). Great recipe since we didn't have the basic tahini seasoning. Turned out yummy... even the picky eaters liked it. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe and it came out great. I accidentally used a little too much black pepper but it was still delicious.  I ground approx a teaspoon or so. Just a pinch too much though. The cilantro and basil are a perfect combination with the lemon.

This is a delicious recipe, although I did omit the olives because I don't like them and also for the high salt content.  I also added more garlic for flavor, and sesame seeds for crunch.  I really liked it a lot.  Thanks!

Pretty great hummus. I think it could use some extra spice but that is just my tastes. I like spicy food. As compared to standard hummus from the middle east it would stand up well.

Best Hummus recipe I have ever tried! I followed the recipe to the tee and I personally like this better than other recipes with tahini in it. I left the mixture rather chunky and everyone loved the texture. Love it love it. This will be my all time go-to recipe for hummus from now on!

Sooo delish!  With the exception of leaving out the basil, I made it exactly as written.  The Spanish olives gives it great flavor along with the mix of garlic and lemon juice.  Didn't require additional salt.  I made Chef John's Pita Bread to go with it and it was fantastic, couldn't stop eating!  I would recommend doubling the hummus recipe as it doesn't make enough to go around after you are done sampling!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved it! I mixed it all up in my Vitamix and it was wonderful. I had to add a little more olive oil; it was a crowd pleaser!

Loved it!  We added a little more oil and lemon juice and omitted the olives (because we didn't have any).  A keeper, thank you!

This was so easy and very good.  This recipe is a keeper for me.  I did not have the olives so I left those out.  I look forward to trying it with the olives.  My chips had salt and lime on them so I did not add the salt and pepper.  I liked it best when I pureed it really smooth like butter. I also added just a bit of lime juice also since I did not have the olives.  Love it!

This was my first hummus and it was a hit!  I may have added a little more cilantro and basil because I don't usually measure that when it is fresh,but this was delicious with fresh veggies.  I will keep this one handy for company always!!  Thank you for sharing!

First time making any hummus. I didn't want to use any oil and I didn't have any lemon juice so I used lime juice. No olives. It was great.

This hummus is delicious!  I used stuffed manzanillas but left out the salt.  No need for it considering the salt content in the olives.  Comes out nice and creamy.  This is a keeper!

Love this recipe - have been making for for a couple of years.  I use it as a base and have tried a couple of different things.  I add a little bit of sesame oil, and black olive or sun-dried tomatoes.  Love homemade hummus!

I found this recipe to be quite good - but I did a few tweaks... I doubled the recipe and used quite a bit more garlic than what was called for (I love garlic). I also used more than what was called for on the basil and cilantro. I also added a couple tablespoons of water after I heard some complain about the consistency being too thick. I only used probably 1/4 cup of the olives in the doubled recipe, and I added about 2 extra tablespoons of fresh lemon juice (I like tangy, too).  To finish, because I like some heat with my hummus, I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of cayenne pepper.  With all those changes, it tastes fantastic! I love that it's healthy, too. :)  Enjoy!

This is my first time making hummus. i bought some at a store recently for 6.99 a pound. It had caramelized onion in it and tasted great. i added some to this recipe and it was delic and much cheaper. Today, am going to use this as a base recipe and add 1/2 can of black beans, cumin and jalapenos and see how that turns out. Like another reviewer said - this is a good basic recipe that other things can be added to. Think that's how i'll use it. I enjoyed it a lot. Husband liked it too!

Thank you Holly!  Delicious - I used Kalamatta olives instead, but only use them if you love them because the taste really comes through.  Also added 2 strips of roasted red pepper as someone else suggested.

I doubled the recipe, estimated the measurements, substituted lime for lemon juice and omitted the cilantro. I left the pimento in the green olives.  Added powdered hot red pepper.   It was good, even very good, but not great.  So I looked at the Black Bean and Chickpea Hummus recipe and borrowed the black beans and curry powder from it.  If I had grilled sweet red peppers on hand I would have added them also.  It came out great and with 2 cans of chick peas and one can of black beans it was enough for me to bring to the girls at work for another game of "Look what I made!"  I gave it 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for as a base to make my own.

I altered the recipe a bit and it turned out great - I used regular black pitted olives instead of the spanish ones, I used dried basil and parsley (i didn't have any cilantro). I also used 2 tbs of olive oil, not 3. YUM!! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh MY GOSH this was good!  More than good; it was awesome!  This is the first time I have ever tried making hummus, and I doubt I'll ever find another recipe I like better. I use fresh pressed garlic, and 3 cloves was just perfect. I also agree with another user who said to start out slow on the salt. You may not want much or any at all because the olives give a saltiness also. GREAT recipe! I ate the whole container myself. I'll be making it again and again and again.

This is the best hummus I've had so far.  I keep trying to find the perfect recipe for hummus.  I think it's the green olives that make it for me.  I'm going to try some other additions as well.  But NICE JOB!  Thanks.

Great recipe!  I did not have cilantro or basil, and this was still excellent.  I did not add any extra salt, and decreased the olive oil by one tablespoon.  Great for a party!

I loved the olive taste - it was a great addition to this easy recipe.
