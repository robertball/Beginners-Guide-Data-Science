C'mon, people! This is a Spam recipe! Use anything but real Spam in it and it's not the same at all. I personally enjoy Spam -- fried, chopped in stir-fries, in musubi, and so on. Food snobs need not make this recipe, but Spam lovers will play around with this just as GRAMMA GORGEOUS did, along with her suggestions for why some ingredients won't work broiled. Spam is already cooked so can be eaten cold. My husband is going to enjoy this -- chopped eggs, cheese, and all. Thanks!

For the hot sandwiches I used 12 oz. of Spam, 2 hard cooked eggs, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, crumbled cooked bacon, a dash of onion powder and REAL Mayonnaise mixed together put on toasted buns and broiled til hot and bubbley. Spam is good as a cold "ham salad" sandwich filling just grind Spam, 2 hard boiled eggs, sweet pickle relish to taste, a dash of onion powder if desired, a half teaspoon of mustard if desired and Miracle Whip spread on buttered buns or bread.

No reason to use Spam on this. No one should be using Spam on anything. Just use some leftover ham. Mix it up. The bacon takes too long to crisp on the sandwich, so precook it and add after broiling for just a minute or so.

If you're a Spam person like my mother is you'd probably love this. She makes something similar (no bacon on hers) and absolutely LOVES it.

These were ok, but not great. My husband ate them and said they were ok, but my 6 kids ages 11 to 18 only ate a bite or two and headed for the peanut butter.

I think the onion was too much and when I broiled them they burned before the bacon could cook. If I ever make them again I'll cut down on the onion and fry the bacon seperately so I don't have to broil the sandwiches for as long. I don't think I'll ever be able to convince my kids to try them again though. Perhaps if they didn't know it was spam?
