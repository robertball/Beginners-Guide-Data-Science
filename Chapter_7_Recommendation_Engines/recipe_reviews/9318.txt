I made this skipping the boiling water step.  My goose was not crispy, but that is not the recipe's fault.  I baked it 3 hours in total, it was a little dry (compare to what I have had before).
I suggest people who try to cook goose for the first time should realize that a goose of same weight of a turkey would give less meat.  I mean for my 11 goose, 3 lb was the grease-- I measured it!  It is harder to carve than a turkey too.  I served 10 people with this goose, and each person barely got 2 piece of meat.  It was a good thing that was a pot luck, so there were other meats.  
I took the left over home and picked out the rest of meat and cooked a soup.  The next day my family of 4 had a soup noodle with goose meat -- chinese style.

I threw a dinner party for 12 last night and this recipe was the main entree.  I have never made goose before, but this recipe turned out beautifully.  It was very involved and time consuming, but the end result was well worth it.  In short, this was delicious.

I made this for the first time christmas 2005. It was a rather long and complicated process, although the out come was worth it. The only problem I had was that the wings and legs got a touch over cooked because I couldn't get them tucked under properly. Next time I would use kitchen twine to tie it up. We also were disappointed that there was not much meat. It served 3 adults and 4 children with a little left over. I had planned to take some to a dinner party the next afternoon, but I hardly had enough to fill a tupperware. My kids absolutley adored it (they love dark meat and crispy skin and they would really eat much else of their dinner) and have been asking ever since for me to make it again. If you like dark meat you should try this.

It might be that I just like duck better, the breast was flavorless & the only thing that my honey liked was the skin which was crispy.  The stuffing and gravy were good but I'll pass on the goose next year.

I didn't care for it, but everyone else liked it.  I guess I'm just not a dark meat fan.  Also, Goose really does not feed a lot of people--BE AWARE!

Pretty good, very moist. The stuffing was delicious! Gave a 4 because we think we may prefer duck better, but other then that, it was great.

Great Goose!  My first time cooking one and it wasn't too difficult with good results.  I would give 5 stars but for the cost of a goose i think I would rather just cook a turkey.  Everyone at the party enjoyed the meal though.

Made this for our Wedding and it was delicious although it's nothing like carving a Turkey.  Stuffed it with some dirty rice and made a lot of side dishes.

Roasted a  10# goose after 48 hour broil and refrigeration. Rubbed salt and teriyaki  into it before cooking and stuffing.  Cooked on 350 for 3 hours, tenting wings and eventually legs with tin foil. Another 25 minutes to bring stuffing up to 200 degrees.
Let cool and sliced. Yummy.
