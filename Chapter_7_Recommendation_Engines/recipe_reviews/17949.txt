This is a great recipe as is, but I made a few adjustments that made it even better. Instead of garlic salt I use garlic powder to cut the sodium and mix it in with the other ingredients. I boil the ribs first for 30 minutes to make them tender, then put them in a deep glass pan (to minimize the sauce burning). I then pour the sauce over the ribs and cook in the oven for another 35 - 45 minutes. Deeelicious!

These ribvs were great. I used baby back ribs which I simmered in water first for one hour, then I backed them according to the directions for one hour. Finally I threw them on the grill for 15 minutes and basted them with BBQ sauce. The results were tender to the bone ribs that were delicious!

OMG! This was soooo good! I poured the sauce over a pork tenderloin, covered w/ foil  & baked @ 375 for about an hour & a half & then removed the foil & broiled to brown it for about 20 minutes. My family raved about this dish! I served it w/ fried cinnamon & brown sugar granny smith apples & a fresh salad but next time I think I will try it w/ a grueyere cheese potato dish instead of the apples ( they both had sweet sauces that seemed redundant).

This is a great recipe, but I added 2tbsp. of cornstarch disolved in 1/4cup of water. The ribs came out with a light sauce coating. I seved them with garlic butter, parmesan, egg noodles.

We love this recipe!  It is now a family favorite!  I cook it in a corningware dish (covered), because it seemed a bit dry on the cookie sheet.  We serve it over rice and use the leftover juices over it as well to add some flavor to the rice.

These ribs were very good, and I am glad I tried them. That said, some of the reviews on here made me think twice before doing so! As far as the cleanup goes... I would NOT recommend using a cookie sheet, your oven will most likely get spattered. I used two Pyrex 13x9 roasting pans, and had no trouble with dripping on my oven floor. I lined my pans with a single layer of cheap foil (all I had), and one pan leaked pretty badly. I soaked it for quite awhile in hot water and then attacked it with a pot scrubber - problem solved. You definately had to put some effort into getting the sauce off, but nothing sensational. Non-stick is a no-no for this recipe. As far as the sauce consistancy, it was more liquid than traditional barbecue, but that didn't compromise the flavor. These would be great for a cook-out, because your fingers stay a whole lot cleaner. Summary: give these delicious ribs a try! Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I loved these ribs.  They were very easy to make.  The next time I make this though, I will use a disposable aluminum pan.  Even with the foil covered pan, it was messy to clean up.  This one is definitely a keeper!

in a word...WOW!  these were excellent.  my husband is normally the rib chef in the house, but after these, i think it will become my job from now on.  i made 5 lbs, and 3 of us ate most of them...including my son who hates ribs.  i ate the left overs for lunch the next day and got in trouble when my husband came home and wanted them!
thanks for the recipe...these will be a regular.

Good ribs.  I love using the pork spareribs because they always come out so tender just about any way you cook them.  I wonder how this would do in a slow cooker.  Planning on making this one again soon.

I'd definitely use one of those cheap disposable aluminum pans or at least double the aluminum foil on the baking sheet. The baking sheet seemed a little shallow, had to clean my oven after this one. Good recipe, even my picky daughter like them!

Giving this recipe 4 stars, only because I tweaked it a bit.  I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes the day before and made the marinade(without the baking soda and tripled it) and used about 1/3 of it to marinade the ribs in a plastic bag in the fridge overnight).  I baked ribs covered at 250 degrees for one hour, heated up the rest of the marinade (adding 2 T cornstarch mixed with 2T water into the marinade) It was nice and thick and sticky and I brushed this on the ribs and put back in the oven for 20 minutes uncovered at 350 degrees, and then brushed them again with remaining marinade.  They were the best ribs we have ever eaten, sweet/garlicky/sticky and so tender and I had used the cheaper side ribs instead of back ribs!

Excellent recipe. I have used this on both baby-back and country style ribs and both times it was wonderful. Made the following alterations: I boiled gently for about an hour (2 TB course salt, w1 cup white vinegar, 1 onion chopped and about 1 cup white wine in boiling water) then followed recipe as instructed (double for x-tra) 

I sprayed non-stick cooking spray on my pans then lined them with foil. Cooked for about 1 hour at 275. Then drained juice and sauce into a pot and added thickener (1 tb cornstarch mixed with 1 tb COLD water) to make it stick to ribs. Turned oven up to 375 and cooked for an additional 15-20 minutes. 

Absolutely delicious and not very difficult at all. I haven't found such a problem as other reviewers with splattering so DO TRY THIS!!! 

~Awesome~

We really did not like this.  It had the flavor of honey without the sweetness.  Will not be making again.

These were so good and so easy, I registered an account just so I could give it 5 stars!  I've never made ribs before, and after this, I don't think I'd ever want to try another recipe.  They turned out perfectly dark with just a little bit of char, and the sauce was delectable.

I made this for a Sunday family gathering. My dad didn't care for it (too sweet), but ALL the kids loved it (even the very picky ones). I thickened the sauce at the end with corn starch - the next time I make these I'll add the corn starch at the beginning. I'll also add some garlic.

This recipe was fantastic! I have never cooked ribs before (I am not a big meat eater) but I cooked these for my boyfriend on our aniversary and he loved them. I don't really like pork and even I loved it. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and I cooked mine in the crockpot on low for 3.5 hours in the honey garlic sauce. I chose the crockpot so I wouldn't have to marinate the ribs over night and also so I could avoid the spillovers that other reviewers noted when baking in the oven. This recipe was so easy I will be making it again for sure!

Wow!  That's all I can say.  This was my first time cooking ribs and they came out so tender, I could pull the bone right out of the meat.
Now, I used country style pork ribs since they were on sale. After I put them in the oven, I covered them for the 1st half hour to prevent drying out.  Other than that, I kept the exact recipe.  The flavors were wonderful and they went great with steamed rice.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Better than any ribs I've eaten in any restaurant, anywhere! I consistently get rave reviews and requests for these ribs from my dinner guests. 

I do boil them first for 45 min - 1 hour, and I cut the full racks of ribs in half, not into individual ribs. Otherwise, I stay faithful to the recipe.

To aid clean-up, I cook them in an aluminum foil roaster I buy at the supermarket, and toss it out afterwards. It doesn't get any easier than that!

Excellent!  Didn't have any white vinegar so I used worcestershire sauce and it was fabulous.  I also added 2 extra cloves of garlic and used 6-8 boneless pork chops and baked uncovered for 45 minutes.  Smells wonderful as it's cooking.  Probably very good with chicken, too.  Will be making this very often!

These ribs were very easy and really tasty. One (big) problem though, was the mess it made in my oven!  I would recommend using a deep dish pan as opposed to a cookie sheet as the sauce kept bubbling over into the oven and burning and smoking.  Not fun to clean up.

We enjoyed the ribs.  I added just a little bit of red pepper.  My family indicated that they prefer ribs cooked another way.

OMG this was good!! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except used garlic powder instead of salt. It came out looking dry and I was so dissappointed I almost threw them out abd ordered chinese food! However, they were Yummy! I am making them again tonight but this time I tripled the sauce and threw them in the slow cooker for 4 hrs, I am hoping this way the meat just falls off the bone! Regardless...the best honey garlic spare ribs EVER!

This is one of the best pork recipes of any kind I've made thus far in my life. The cooking time was perfect -- meat falling off the bone (I used country ribs instead of spare ribs). The baste is delicious, though maybe a little salty for some tastes.  I made seasoned potato wedges as the side for these ribs and used the pan leavings as dipping sauce. Amazing!  Thanks for this recipe, it's going on my top-ten for dinner parties.

These were SOOO good - My whole family LOVED them.  One thing - I used a cookie sheet, and the sauce bubbled up and made a mess of my oven.  Next time, I will use a bit less sauce and/or use a cake pan with bigger sides.

After reading several reviews I made a few changes and our ribs turned out great. I parboiled for about 30 minutes before cooking. To eliminate the foaming problem I let the sauce sit for those 30 minutes. I added an additional 2 cloves of garlic and instead of sprinkling with garlic salt I used our favorite spicy cajun seasoning. The only thing I think I would do different next time is leave the ribs in a rack and use a pan with higher edges. The entire baking time my house smelled of burning sugar because the sauce spilled when I put the pan in the oven.

Don't let the thin sauce fool you, it thickens up quite a bit in the oven. Next time I think I will add a splash of liquid smoke and make a bit more of the sauce  as I had none left to pour over the ribs. I do strongly recommend lining your baking sheet with non stick foil as the sauce is sticky and does a nice job blackening the ribs (and baking sheet.)  Also turning the ribs every 20 minutes is extremely important! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Very tasty sauce, I should have listend to the other reviewers suggest doubling the sauce.  We sure could have used it.  Also, it makes such a cool chemical reaction when adding the baking soda!  My ribs weren't as tender as I would have liked, maybe the oven temp is a bit too high?  Overall, delicious.

Really enjoyed these spareribs.  Next time I will bring the ribs to a boil first, simmer for 1/2 an hour and follow the recipe (for the wonderful flavour)using double foil as the sauce leaked under the foil onto the cookie sheet.

These ribs are wonderful.  Cooked in foil pan covered slowly at first 250 degrees for 3 hours turning every hour.   Then  uncovered and cooked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes--very tender.

This is one meal that was a family pleaser. I didn't have the white vinegar and substituted cider vinegar and it tasted great.  I liked that it didn't have that bbq taste and the aroma was nice while it baked.  Had sweet potatoes, asparagus and a salad.  A job well done.:)

These tasted pretty good.  I added 1/4 tsp red pepper.  Next time I'll add a little more.  I boiled the ribs for 1/2 hour and then baked them uncovered in a glass dish for a 1/2 hour.  The sauce burned a little bit.  Next time I'll try wrapping them in foil with the sauce for the baking.

OH MY GOSH! What a fun and easy recipe!!! Once you add the baking soda to the garlic and honey mixture it's like a volcano! I was so skeptical when I saw that, but I figured "Hey, I'm halfway-I might as well finish" and I'm so glad I did!!! This was the best ribs I've ever had! My hubby felt the same way! I think I may end up using this for Father's Day on Sunday. Thanks soooo much for this crazy, but yummy recipe!!! The only suggestion I have for those who said it has no flavor is increase the garlic by about a little less than a clove...helps bring out the tang of the mixture. Thanks again!

The flavor was excellent but 1 hour baking time was too long. I boiled the ribs for 30 minutes then poured the sauce over them and baked them for 45 minutes covered with foil. They were perfect after 30 minutes but I left them in longer and the sauce burnt. Turning is important in getting  even browning. Will try this again as the recipe is really easy.

Within 1/2 hour the smoke was so bad I had to crack open the windows... in the dead of winter. And they were very done. I followed the recipe precisely with the exception that I did not use tinfoil under the ribs, just put them right on the pan.

I have nothing new to add about this recipe.  It's absolutely delicious; the only reason why I don't make it more often is because I can't stop eating them once they're done.  Yes, the recipe is kind of messy, but it's worth it!  I tend to halve the meat called for to double the sauce:meat ratio, so I can have extra sauce to eat over rice.

We loved this - even my daughter who isn't a big fan of ribs.  Read several reviews and did add the cornstarch (2 tsp in 1/4 cup water), and as I had about 3 hours before supper, I sprayed a roasting pan and baked them in there at 325 deg.; covering the pan loosely with foil until the last 1/2 hour, and stirred them every 20 minutes.  They were so tender and delicious.  Can't wait to try this recipe with chicken!

We did not really care for the taste.  I make a lot of dishes using honey, but not sure why this one was not to our liking.  I did this in the crockpot, so that may be why.  Will try it one more time in the oven and see what happens and update when we do.

I followed the recipie exactly like it said and next time i'm going to use 2 sheets of aluminum foil cuz the liquid made a big mess and soaked through the foil and stuck on to the pan and there is way too much soya sause. 
I didnt really like them that much but my husband really enjoyed them.

This recipe turned out great for us the flavor was awesome and the family was suprised it didn't have to have bbq sauce on it. 
I did over crowd the pan and the foam spilled over and burnt the oven my bad ;)

Nice change of pace. Be careful that the sauce doesn't burn, maybe put it on on the last turn.

delicious...this sauce would be great for any meat!

I altered it slightly...used more garlic cloves than asked for and seasoned my meat with season-all and cilantro paste.

Will make again.

Whoa was this sauce sweet.  I can't imagine why it has to be so incredibly sweet.  We don't eat much ribs but I did find it odd that there was two-parts honey to 1-part soy sauce.  Normally when I make a sauce or marinade, the recipe is ALWAYS equal parts soy sauce with either sugar or honey or some other sweet ingredient.  And it always turns out perfect.  We also thought it was very dry as followed.  With a few changes, it def has potential to be awesome though.

Very yummy recipe! I par-boiled my ribs as some suggested. I added soya sauce and garlic powder to the water just because I find that it really infuses the meat with flavour. I used an entire head of crushed garlic as I wanted a really nice strong garlic flavour. They turned out great! Seved them with a little garlic butter and parm tossed pasta, as another reviewer suggested :)

My hubby loved these.  He was a little hesitant because he doesn't like real sweet foods.  I added a bit more barbeque sauce than requested.  I also use country stlye ribs and put them on low in my crock pot for 10 hours.  They were so moist and tender.

I loved these!!  My kids loved these ribs.  They are so flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I boiled the ribs for 40 minutes since mine were frozen.  I also baked them UNCOVERED so that the sauce would thicken up and it did.  It was all gooey and yummy!!!  Perfect!  My husband asked me to make them again next week.

These ribs were pretty darn good.  I did use slightly more garlic then the recipe called for though.  I thought the sauce was great and wouldn't mind trying it on chicken wings too.

I cut the ribs into serving size instead of individual rib, it is easier to turn them over during cooking. I dont have any vinegar on hand so I used lemon juice and added some lemon zest. I had also thrown in some frozen chestnuts. Surprisingly they went very well with ribs, loved them! Next time I will try to boil the ribs first as suggested by another reviewer and grill after marinate with the sauce.

This is the easiest recipe for great tasting ribs.  My family doesn't like really gooey ribs and this was an excellent alternative.  I read other reviews and followed their advice...I boiled the ribs before coating & baking and used a roasting pan instead of a cookie sheet.  Everyone loved these ribs!

I wanted to try something different and I was pleased with how the recipe turned out.  It was easy and the sauce was extremely yummy.  My husband likes old fashioned bbq ribs, but when he tasted these he LOVED them.  He wanted to take the leftovers to work with him the next day. This one's a keeper. I will take others advice and double the sauce since it's soooo good.

This is a great recipe!!  It was easy to make.  The ribs were great dipped into the sauce.  It would be a great sauce to use on chicken, shrimp, etc.  Next time I would reduce the cooking time.

These are great I have made them many times with rave reviews from my family.  I use baby back ribs and boil them for 2 hours the day before.  When I take them out of the water I marinate the ribs in the sauce overnite. Then throw them in the oven. Talk about melt in your mouth good!!!!  I am trying it with chicken this evening.  I know it will be great!

I had a bit of a problem with this recipe.  The ribs came out great....but the sauce that you pour over the ribs burnt into a black sticky mess.  I followed the recipe exactly and I cut down the cooking time to 45 min. and the sauce still burnt. Has anyone else had any problems, or what did I do wrong?  I may try next time to brush the sauce on the ribs when they are turned instead of pouring it over the ribs in the beginning.

Our newest family favorite!  Have also passed along to numerous friends.  We LOVE garlic, so I've made the following changes: 3 cloves instead of one, sprinkle with garlic salt every time I baste and use 1/2 cup of vinegar instead of 1/4.  Also I cook them in a 9x13 pyrex pan and baste them often so they stay really juicy and gooey.  Even my 2 year old loves them!

To me, these ribs were pretty good, my boyfriend said not to cook them for anyone else because they could cause someone to propose. We'll be setting a date soon. So if you are getting impatient, make these ribs and you will soon be engaged.  I used pork country ribs so it took a little longer to bake and I baked them in a deep sided pan. When making them a second time,I basted the meat everytime I turned it and added more garlic salt each time, they were much better.

I absolutely love these ribs!  It also works well with chicken (marinate first).  I have shared this recipe with my grandmother and mother-in-law and they both agree, it's a good thing!  I would like to warn people though:  when you add the baking powder, it foams up and looks a bit strange -- just go with it!  You won't be sorry!

These ribs are the perfect ribs to make if you need a recipe that doesn't require the meat to be marinated. Just mix all the ingredients and then pop it in the oven. It has the perfect savory flavor, not too sweet and not too salty. My dad loved it, and he's the pickiest among our family. :)

This recipe has the potential to be restaurant quality however the cooking instructions are slightly off. The ribs need to be simmered for an hour to remove surface fat. I cooked these low and slow at 300 for two hours in a dutch oven, basting every half hour. I stayed as close to the ingredient list as possible, subbing garlic powder for the garlic salt. This method produces ribs that are tender and juicy with a surface that is carmilized. Thanks Laurie, this one is a keeper.

Delish! I boiled the ribs for a good hour before putting the sauce on them and baking for 30 minutes. They were so good, next time I will double the sauce recipe and use it for a marinade for other meats.  Will absolutely make again!

I have to say that I've tried this recipe twice now and had I rated it after the first try it would have received 1 star. This recipe does not belong with ribs, it is MUCH too sweet.  The second time I tried it with chicken and it was fantastic.  The extra sauce does go great with rice.  I will keep this recipe however I will file it in my chicken recipes. (I also think this would go well with pork tenderloin.)

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I would place in a pan with higher sides.  My glazed mixtures boiled over all over the oven.  Nice flavor and I will make again.

I loved this rib recipe! I didn't mean to do this but it ended up really great! The recipe called for only 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, I put 1/4 of cup in. It still turned out really great! My husband thought it was the best ribs I ever made. Thanks for the great recipe! Peace out and cook on !

I found this recipe to be very tasty.  I did not have Honey, but everything else I added.  It was my very first attempt at making Ribs and i wanted something easy.  This was definitely Easy.  The only thing I have bad to say is the amount of Grease that these Ribs had.  Will try baking them on a cookie rack or something next time to have the oil drip off onto the cookie sheet.  Way too much Grease, but so darn tasty!

I use this recipe a lot. It is my most requested "please bring" to any occasion. This sauce is so versatile! For use in the slow cooker, double or triple the sauce and you can fill the slow cooker almost half full with meat. We usually use a combination of chicken thighs and breasts, but we have had success with drumsticks and ribs together. Clean up is easiest with a Pampered Chef stone, or with parchment paper. The sauce is quite runny, but if you have leftovers, it's a great way to preserve the moistness of the meat. Thanks to other reviewers for the suggestion to use cornstarch. I will definitely try that next time!

I LOVED this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. My husband now calls it his favorite dish ever. We didn't have any ribs, but we did have a tenderloin, so I cut it into strips and did the rest as recommended. Wonderful!

I did what most reviewers said and boiled it first.  I let it marinade overnight then baked.  Very good, very very soft.  I skipped the baking soda, but I don't think it made a difference since I already boiled the ribs.  Easy recipe!

This is a delicious recipe. I used a glass baking dish for the boneless ribs.  I put meat tenderizer on the ribs and let that soak in while I made up the sauce. I ran out of honey at 1/3 cup and omitted the baking soda. As another reviewer suggested I added a sprinkle of cornstarch and I heated the sauce a little to melt the brown sugar and cornstarch before pouring it over the ribs.  Every 20 min I flipped them over and the last 20 min I cooked them uncovered.  The sauce was thick and bubbly.  Next time I'll try the 1/2 cup of honey but I really don't think it's necessary, I just want to see what the taste difference is. I'll definitely make this again, mabe do a large batch for a party as something different than the usual barbeque style ribs.

I looooved the flavor of these ribs!  I did boil them for about 30 mins before baking, then baked them for about 35 mins.  My only complaint was that they were a little dry... but it was my first time making ribs.  ALSO, the sauce was so good that I was bummed there wasn't really an extra for the rice I made!  Next time I am going to double the sauce, and I don't think I'll boil them first.  OH, also, I did not have any problems with a mess in the oven.  I covered my baking stone with 3 sheets of foil, and did not have any boiling-over.

Not sure what I did wrong here but the sauce burnt to a crisp and bubbled over (from the baking soda - seems a weird ingredient) the top of the cookie sheet which caused the smoke alarm to go off! I can't really taste anything over the burnt flavor. The only thing I did different was I used bone-in spare ribs and added a little ginger. I don't think I'll be making this again unless I can figure out how to not let the excess sauce burn. Too bad because it was so easy.

Really, really good ribs! I was a little hesitant about them after reading in so many reviews that they made such a mess. I baked mine in a covered casserole dish coated with cooking spray and they turned out great. Even better, there was very little mess to clean up. I'll definitely make these again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not sure what happened- I followed this to the letter (other than using a baking dish instead of a cookie sheet per others recommendations) and my ribs were tough and chewy.  Flavor was good, but hard to enjoy when you are working so hard to chew.

Excellent pinch-hit for a barbeque rained out!  We didn't have garlic salt on hand, however, so added 2 more cloves of garlic to the sauce and just salted the ribs in the pan.  Due to the high sugar content, we  did need to watch carefully near the end of baking time, so it didn't get too brown.  But it was EXCELLENT hot, and made great next-day leftovers.  Thanks!

Excellent!! I remove as much fat as possible from ribs then fry to brown.  Mixed up sauce and poured over ribs in a single layer in a glass 9x13 pan.  Cover with foil and turned every 20 minutes for an hour.  The last 20 minutes added 1 1/2 tbsp. of cornstarch to cold water  then to the sauce in pan.  Cooked with the foil off for the last 20 minutes till the hour was up.  Very moist and have shared the recipe already.  The sauce was great over rice.  Just realized as I checked the recipe again, I never added the baking soda or the garlic powder.  Oh well it still came out Great.  Thanks for a Keeper!!! PS- Will be trying this recipe in a slow cooker next time for convinience.

The taste of the ribs is unsurpassed to any other rib recipe I know of. I've done this recipe twice over the weekend, once for the my family and then for my friends. I'm a garlic lover, so I used a little more garlic. The ribs are glazed with the honey garlic sauce, can't stop licking your fingers.

I am a honey garlic freak and this is an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL sauce that I inadvertently made changes to in an attempt to thicken the sauce for basting - it didn't work out for basting but I will definately do it this way next time...  I combined the ingredients as noted with a tad bit more honey, brought it to a gentle boil on the stove for about 10 minutes, added 1 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a bit of water near the end and took it off the heat.  For the rib preparation: I cut up my ribs, wrapped them in tin foil with a little bit of salt and pepper, placed them on a cookie sheet and baked them in the oven at 200 for 4 1/2 hours.  Took them out and let them cool for about an hour.  I sprayed a small roaster with pam, threw in the ribs, poured the sauce over and baked them at 350 for about 15-20 minutes.  The sauce thickened up beautifully and the ribs tasted wonderful.

Although I doubt many vegetarians will be reading the reviews... I made the sauce (didn't have baking soda, used some cornstarch to thicken it up) and sauteed some tofu with it for a stirfry.  I imagine it would work equally well with chicken.

I was looking for an easy honey garlic ribs recipe and I found it!  I had boiled the ribs first, then put it in the oven.  I had to scale down the sauce for a 1 lb portion of ribs and I made an 'oops'...  Being the first time I had ever cooked with garlic, I had used half a BULB rather than the half a CLOVE that it called for.  The sauce was still very good even though there turned out to be a TON of garlic in it.  Highly recommended...

Wow - is this recipe good! We used pork instead of ribs and it was just wonderful. The pork was perfect, tender and didn't even need any additional sauce marinade at the end. I am definitely going to make this recipe again!

My boyfriend liked it but I didn't think it was too great. Ribs just can't be stuck in the oven. need to be boiled. Way too messy, sauce wasn't that great.

These ribs were good, but I was expecting more of a garlic & honey taste.  I used baby back ribs, and made everything exactly to the recipe.  My husband really enjoyed them, he ate them all!  The recipe is very quick & easy.

These were good, but I didn't pay attention to how much sauce the ribs coat! So I didn't find them very honey or garlicy!I would suggest making more "sauce" than it calls for. Otherwise, people liked them!

hmmm.  Reminded me of lunch "take out" kind of Chinese food.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  Served beside sticky rice, sprinkled sesame on top and garnished with cilantro.  Easy to make.  Used foil lined foil 9x13 pan.  Had difficulty fitting all the meat in, but it did cook through in an hour.  Within half and hour removed foil from foil pan and easily rinsed out.  The sides on the 9x13 caught whatever mess would have escaped from a cookie sheet into the oven.  If I'm ever tempted to make this again, I'll have a pan ready to go.

this recipe was ok. it was different but not the best. use a foil baking pan lined with foil instead of the cookie sheet to avoid messing your oven.

I found this sauce to be delicious and felt that it would be a very effective marinade as well if left on the ribs for a couple of hours before cooking.  Next time I will use my crock pot for this recipe.  One hour just simply did not get these ribs tender enough.

I've tried a few honey garlic recipes from this site and most of them have been kinda gross, bearable at most, but this recipe is exactly what I've been searching for. Tastes just like the honey garlic wings you'd get from a restaurant or bar. I used them on some chicken wings instead of ribs and I'll be using this recipe from now on. Only thing I did different was I skipped the baking soda and used 2 tbs of flour to thicken.

Loved them!!! So full of  flavor!!! They  came out super  tinder and yummy  just  they way ribs  should  taste. I was tired of  making  ribs the same  way  all the time, so when I  saw this  recipe I knew  I  just  had to  try it. My 11 year old  is really  picky so I was a little bit  worried,  but they  were  a hit!!! Every one loved  them

Good recipe. I browned the ribs in a saucepan, and added the sauce once browned. I then cooked it on the oven top for over an hour. At the end, I took out the ribs and thickened the sauce with flour. Then, I put the meat back. Cooking it on the oven top made for a very clean kitchen. Next time, though, I'll put in more honey and less baking soda.

I used the crockpot as suggested by another user....the ribs were tender and flavourful. I prefer a stickier rib however my husband does not. My suggestion to those that like them sticky would be to drain the liquid and boil it with a cornstarch and water mix. Then add it back to the ribs.

Delicious, but 375 burns the honey every time, 325-350 is a much better temperature, at least if you're cooking them a whole hour.

I only had red wine vinegar on hand so I used that.  Marinated overnight and cooked slower and longer but that's the way that we like it.  Yumm Yumm in my Tum Tum!

This is the third time I have made this dish, and they have turned out amazing each time! Love them! Tonight we put julienned pieces of red onion on top together with very little ginger, rock salt and garlic granules. When done, I sprinkled with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Love them!

It was a very tasty dish.  Some tweaks I used initially were to line a covered oval casserole dish with heavy duty foil making cleanup a non-issue.  I sliced the ribs into two and cooked them covered in the sauce low and slow at 325 for 2 hours.  Fall off the bone meat was tender and delicious.  Served over rice with a salad made for an excellent meal.  

Further tweaks I will make the next time I make it will be to reduce the amount of soy sauce and increase both the minced garlic and honey...other than that, there is nothing I would change (like another reviewer I only use garlic powder and never garlic salt).

This recipe is definitely a keeper. My family and I loved them.  I used a deep metal pan lined with parchment paper and had no problem with mess. I used garlic powder rather than salt and I added 2 tbsps. cornstarch mixed with a little water to the sauce before I added the baking soda.  Really, really good...and made it to my recipe scribbler!  Will double or triple next time as sauce was a little scarce.

My boyfriend said these were the best ribs he's ever had!  I threw mine in the crockpot with all the ingredients and they came out great.  They were on the low setting for several hours, until they flaked off the bone.

Love these ribs.  It's such a good break from tomatoey BBQ sauced ribs.  These are relatively quick and easy and my husband loves them.  I actually got the recipe from this site a couple of years ago before I realized what a goldmine AR is.

Delicious sauce.  I used a casserole dish though and it was too small (clean up was easy, warm water was enough) so not all the ribs were as covered in sauce as would have been nice.  Also I used side ribs and better quality ribs would definitely make a difference.  Will be making it again though!

this was such a great recipe. We all loved it! I didn't change any ingredients. I put it in a roaster that I had sprayed generously with "Pam". That was the only change I made. Clean up was easy and the ribs were delicious!

Oh my wow!! nothing more I can say. These were so good. It gave a great change from the barbeque sauce I usually do.  The only change I made was I didn't have garlic on hand so I did 2 tablespoons of garlic powder in replace. Excellent recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Don't know what happened to the flavour, there wasn't any.  Precooked the ribs as others did, then followed the recipe exactly.  Ribs were tender, but did not taste of either honey or garlic, just bland. Won't be making these again.

This is a great recipe.  It is something different (rather than just your standard bbq)to dress up those ribs.  We will be making this one again.  Thanks so much.

Ribs turned out great - I'm an amateur at best, so I ended up buying ribs that had a some BBQ marinate on it already.  But I love garlic and ended up putting just a tad more...  also, as a huge rice fan, I must say the sauce in general is fantastic to pour over rice.  Great flavor!

Well, this was quite disappointing. I think they could have potential, but 1 hour cooking time is way too long, and the sauce wasn't too great. Everything was burnt, and the house filled with smoke. The sauce got everywhere, even under the foil-covered pan, and completely destroyed it. I will not be making these again.

I think this recipe was okay but the thing that was disappointing was the way the sauce continued to foam after I put it in the oven.  I used a cookie sheet as instructed and after 20 minutes or so in the oven I began to smell something burning. When I checked the "sauce" had foamed itself over the side of the pan and onto the oven, making a very nasty mess and leaving a heavy unpleasant odor in the air.  It took a while to eliminate the smell.  So, beware and watch carefully after it goes in the oven.

I liked the flavor of the sauce but it wasn't strong enough for me. I marinated the ribs overnight but it was more of a subtle flavor. I don't think husband was too impressed, because he didn't say anything when he usually raves about the dishes that he likes. Definitely line your cookie sheet with foil because it makes for very easy clean up.

This turned out really good. I used boneless pork patties and baked it for about 20 minutes less than the recipe said to and it came out nice and juicy!

I've made this a number of times and it's always a hit. I rarely measure the ingredients and the recipe always turns out yummy. If you don't foil line your pan you'll have a fun mess to clean up! Oh and I don't use a cookie sheet because there's way too much excess sauce.

This recipe (made exactly as specified) was really underwhelming.  I've had much more flavourful results with other recipes.  I don't know why, but this ended up being quite bland.

really yummy!  used country style as suggested by some, but will double the sauce next time.  Also par-boiled them for 30 minutes or so first.  Cooked in foil roaster so clean up was a breeze.  Excellent with garlic mashed potatoes.

We added more garlic and some ginger to the recipe.  We thought these were pretty good for our first time making them.  Next time we will change the recipe and probably add the cornstarch.  We didn't have problems with cleanup like some previous posters, we just lined the cookie sheet with foil.

I enjoyed the sauce but cooked the ribs first covered in the oven for 1 hr on 350 then added sauce for another 25-30 min. They turned out great, seasoned perfect and very close to my favorite b-bque place.

I liked this recipe.. Rather than bake though, I stirfried the ribs in a little oil, then poured off the oil, and added the sauce(to which I added some cornstarch to thicken and a bit of crushed pineapple, and some garlic, and seasoned to my taste)and covered and simmered till sauce was slightly thickened and ribs were oh so tender... Cleanup was a breeze! Enjoy...

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I saw a comment that the sauce didn't stick to the ribs, so I reduced the amount of liquid and added cornstarch. The sauce still ran off of the meat. The flavor was okay, but hardly any of it actually remained on the ribs.

Oh man, are these some awesome ribs.  I used cider vinegar (no white on hand) and otherwise followed directions.  Yummy!  My only little complaint would be that I wish the sauce would stick to the ribs better.  I tried some cornstarch, per another reviewer, but still would like it a little thicker/stickier.  Wonderful flavor and succulently tender.

I add a pinch more salt and some cornstarch at the end so the sauce really coats the ribs. It's so good and the ribs are super tender.

Wonderful recipe. I browned the ribs in a skillet and then popped them in the slow cooker for about 7 hours with the sauce on top. Very good flavor.

This was very good.  I think next time I will marinade the ribs in the mixture.  I also used pork spareribs and babyback ribs and they turned out wonderful.  I did not slice the ribs before I cooked them, but afterwards, and I think this helped them cook in the same amount of time and kept them tender.  Thanks

Very good. Make sure to cut your ribs as evenly as possible, (or have the butcher do it)because my smaller pieces were obviously a bit dry. The sauce was great over rice. And I love the fact that these are good at room temperature, so I can use them for a get together or appetizer. Will make lots more!

These ribs were very tasty. I boiled my ribs for about an hour prior to proceeding with the recipe, for that "fall off the bone" tenderness.  I did, however ruin a cookie sheet making these ribs.  I lined the sheet with foil as instructed and the sauce leaked through and the foil basically cooked to the pan. So it was impossible to remove.  Once it cooled, the remaining sauce was like a thick hardened candy coating on the cookie sheet that I couldn't get clean.  I would highly recommend this recipe, BUT use a disposable aluminum tray/cookie sheet.

Wonderful! My kids enjoyed when I added the baking soda and the sauce started bubbling up (be sure to use large bowl), and it made it so easy to coat the ribs.  My husband enjoyed this also but he still likes 'barbaqued' ribs better.  Felt a little funny about not boiling the ribs in salted water, so went ahead and boiled for about 15-20 minutes first.  Shared this recipe with a friend who did not boil and says they still came out tender so the boiling just gave me 1 extra dish to wash.  Great recipe. Give it a try if you have not done so yet!

I tried this recipe on boneless, skinless chicken breasts and on pork chops.  The chicken came out moist, tender and very delicious, but the pork chops were tough.  The flavor just didnt mix well with the chops.  I really liked this recipe and I will use it again on chicken and ribs, but I must mention that the cleanup was tough. Overall a great recipe.

This was a great sweet recipe for ribs.  However, my rating of 3 stars was due to the horrible mess and high maintenance of this dish.  I took previous warnings about the sauce and so I prepped the bottom and sides of my baking dish with several layers of aluminum foil before adding the pork ribs and sauce.  After 20 minutes passed to turn the ribs, the sauce was already splattering on the bottom of my oven.  Next, I transferred my ribs and the sauce I could gather and placed everything into a deeper dish and then covered it with foil before baking in the oven again.  Guess What....after another 20 minutes, in time for another turn of the ribs, the sauce was bubbling up and splattering again onto the oven bottom.  Fortunately I boiled the ribs before baking it in the beginning, so I knew that the ribs were already cooked.  It was just a matter of getting the ribs to take on the honey garlic sauce.  I plan on making this again, however ONLY if I'm prepared for the clean up afterwards.

As others have mentioned, be sure to: Boil the ribs for an hour, double the sauce recipe and use a disposable aluminum pan on top of the cookie sheet for baking. 15 mins on the grill also helps to carmelize the glaze. These ribs were very tangy and the honey flavor was overwhelming. I would suggest using a high grade honey as the store brand one I used was a bit too powerful for my family's tastes. Great served with chinese style cuisine such as steamed vegetables and rice. Bring the wet naps, these are finger licking good!!

This sauce was great, and extremely easy. My husband and I halved the recipe, since we had less ribs. My ribs were a little drier than I like, but I think it was the meat-the sauce was terrific! Thanx for an awesome recipe!

We really enjoyed this.  The whole "foaming" thing was strange!  The flavor reminded me of the bourbon chicken you find at the mall.  Also used the seasoning (without the baking soda) with a pork roast in the slow cooker.  That was excellent as well.

I made extra sauce to put over the rice.  My husband loved these ribs and wants them again.  We like things spicy so I added a bit of red pepper flakes.  Yummy!

I used country style pork-ribs and doubled the sauce.  I cooked the ribs for almost 2 hours and they were fabulous.  I stir-fried some veggies and steamed some rice and the meal was a hit.  I'm not sure what the folks who said it tasted medicinal did to their food, but I thought this was great.  I will make again.

WOW!! I have been wasting money on ribs for a few years now but not any more!..Great taste, I tripled the sauce and glad I did..(I like LOTS of sauce)..I'm not sure if it was my "old" oven but I found the cooking time to be a bit to long...However, I did simmer the ribs for a wile which probably should cut down on the oven bake time.(I'll know next time)I also added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of maple syrup to the sauce...nice recipe!!!...Give it a try.

Shame on me for not looking at the recipe with my brain engaged... I was expecting what the name implies... honey-garlic flavor. Well you get honey-soy sauce flavor instead... the whole family ranged from disappointed to out-n-out dislike. Not something to give to the dog, but it will never happen at this home again. I shall try to salvage the remains (the ribs are to expensive to toss) by putting some traditional BBQ-Sauce and grilling them for lunch… as I am the only one will to eat them.

I line a 9 x 13 pan with foil and use large country style ribs.  I cook these for one hour, turning every 20 minutes.  When I remove from the oven I cover with foil while preparing the rest of the meal.  My husband just loves these.  They have become a family favorite.

Yum, Yum!  One of my few 'keepers' from allrecipes!  The sauce does 
a great job interrogating the meat.  I make a little extra, to spread over the 
finished product.  Don't hesitate to use this one!

I'm a horrible cook, but when i served it to my 
boyfriend he said it tasted just like something 
you would get a restaurant. So if I can do it
anyone can :)

This ribs taste very good. I forgot the baking soda and I used garlic salt.  I only put it in for 45 mins and I did not get much sauce.  It was nicely carmelized. Highly recommended.

Excellent recipe however, an hour for cooking time was too long for my ribs because they burnt a bit...maybe 50 minutes cooking time would be better!  Kim.

This is a quick and easy dish that I made for my whole family, including a seven and an eight year old. Everything was great. The only thing was that I added a bit more honey, as I didn't find the half cup sweet enough.

Used it as a baste for the ribs on the BBQ. Every flip I basted it wth this recipe. At last flip I threw on some regular BBQ. Simply Amazing.  The flavour this recipe gives to the ribs is to die for!!! Sorry No Pic.....ate them too fast!!

This recipe is Fantastic!
The only thing I changed was to add more garlic simply for personal preference. Love the baking soda technique. Allows the sauce to cling to the ribs. Genius.

I used Pork Back Ribs and they turned out great. I now see what the aluminum foil is for. Before putting the ribs on the foil, I sprayed it with some cooking oil like Pam. Make sure to turn them as instructed.

This is our new go to rib marinade. I lightly salted and peppered the meat first and did not use baking soda. I also used garlic powder instead of real garlic. We grilled them on a charcoal grill tonight and I'm pretty sure it's the best thing we've ever made. Ate them too fast to take a picture!

I usually make two or three slabs. I cut them up into 3-4 bone pieces.  Other than that, I don't add anything. Never use the garlic salt. Great meal!

This recipe was great. I boiled my ribs in half water/half chicken broth with fresh onions and garlic for about an hour. After I threw them into a ziplock bag with the all the ingredients this recipe called for. After about 5 hours I threw these bad boys onto the grill. Perfection!

I didn't care for this recipe. Not enough of the sauce sticks to the ribs to give enough flavour - for me, it's just sweet meat.

Ribs turned out very tender. Made more of the sauce to drizzle over rice. New family favorite. I put the ribs in a roasting pan not a cookie sheet. Easier to handle and less mess. Still lined the pan with tinfoil which made for easier cleanup.  Will try sauce on pork next.

My son kept complaining he didnt like the way I always made ribs.  I have made them thesame for the last ten years... I decided to try this recipe.  Low & behold a miracle happened!!! He loved them and so did I!!!!!
I did baste them every 20 minutes and next time i would line casserole dish with double layers of tinfoil or a throw away, i used single layer and i must of poked a hole in it.  Needless to say the dish will be soaking for a week!!!    LoL

I chose this recipe because of its relatively short baking
time. I skipped the vinegar and baking soda because I didn't have them, added a little mustard to the sauce and used salt instead of garlic salt. The ribs were juicy, sweet and delicious! I served it with garlic bread and vegetable soup. I will make this again!

I changed a few things in the recipe. Instead of white vinegar I used apple cider vinegar, a few dashes of oyster sauce and a few dashes of roasted sesame oil. It came out delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Fantastic Recipe.  I make it all the time.  I always use garlic powder instead of garlic salt (soy sauce has enough sodium) and I sprinkle it over the ribs in the pan.  

I have experimented with par boiling the ribs and not... the meat is a little bit more tender if you preboil for about 30 min before baking if you boil too long it gets mushy (don't do that).  

I've also used this recipe on chicken wings - still comes out amazing... only drawback is that when the sauce gets cold its stronger than the chicken wing flesh sometimes... But, it tastes so good no one really cares.  Great, easy go to recipe!

The flavors didn't really cut through the meat. I'll probably make it again but I want to marinate the meat with the sauce for a couple of hours/overnight before cooking.

Awesome!  I had balsamic vinegar & no white vinegar, still foamed after adding the baking soda.  As I flipped the ribs in 20 min intervals, I added brown sugar & garlic powder (didn't have garlic salt)  to add a crust texture to the outside.  Amazing, loved by everyone who tried them, we used the remaining sauce after cooking to top our mashed potatoes, it was marvelous!!

Delicious, I added 2 extra cloves of minced garlic, we love garlic! I was out of brown sugar so I used sugar with a bit of molasses. This was the second time I have used this recipe, the first time without any alterations except extra garlic. yummy!

This recipe worked well for me.  I made a few changes to suit me a bit better.  I cooked the ribs first in my slow cooker.  Then when it came time to add the sauce, I heated the sauce first in a sauce pan.  I put the rib portions into a glass baking pan and brushed the sauce onto the ribs and baked them for about 15 minutes.  The dish was easy to clean doing it this way.

These ribs are super easy to make and are perfect for the tailgate.  We make this every game and everyone devours them.  The best thing hot or cold everyone loves them! Make sure you turn them so they get nice and crispy.   I tried this on chicken wings and it was ok.  keep to something that absorbs the marinate.

i love these ribs and made the sauce as listed many many times.  HOWEVER i recently found the baking soda to be too much and halved it to much better results.  i know its not kosher in the rib world but i ALWAYS boil my ribs until the meat starts to pull away from the bone and then put all ribs and sauce in a covered dish in the oven, stirring it all up a couple of times over the course of 40min or so at 350.

LOVED this sauce!!  I poured 1/2 of this on meatballs and reserved the other half for use later for wings.  I'll add hot chili's to that last bit.  I served the honey garlic meatballs with steamed broccoli and basmati rice.  Not fancy but a quick and delicious dinner...and the kids wanted to lick those empty plates! A DEFINITE must try - you'll love it!  I added a TBS of cornstarch to this recipe other than that it's perrrrfect!

The sauce was really good, but I changed the cooking time/temp. I baked for 4 hours at 300.  I was just looking for a sauce recipe, I knew how long I was going to cook the ribs.  Wonderful, fall off the bone.

These are soooo easy!  I boil them first with herbs, spices, onion & garlic for about 40-45 minutes.  Then they only take 15-20 minutes to crisp in the over or bar-b-que.  SOOOO GOOOD! Easy clean up too! :)

Was very quick and easy. Was leary at first because it seemed runny, which resolved itself with continued baking and turning. Flavor was yummy. Will take advise of others and use country style ribs next time. Thanks!

What a great change of pace from the regular BBQ ribs... We marinated our ribs overnight with the sauce then grilled with the sauce in foil pouches and had delicious, tender, meat falling off the bone ribs! Thank you for this keeper!

These are some of the most awesome ribs I have ever tasted.  I love barbeque, but the beau dosen't so these are perfect.  I use country style ribs and they turn out great.  I always serve them with baked potatoes and baked beans.  Warning: Line your dish with foil and don't let in boil over into the over.

Very tasty.  Would work well in a slow cooker for tenderness.  I poured out the sauce and thickened it with cornstarch, then poured it on top for more flavor. Yummy.

We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these ribs.  Kinda reminds me of a teriyaki type sauce.  I boil my ribs for a 1/2 hour first and then put them in the oven.  Even made them in a dutch oven last week and they were just as tasty!

I cooked these on the grill covered with Pam sprayed foil and basted the ribs often with the sauce.  They turned out very good.  That way I had no burned sauce and no major cleanup.  Just throw away the foil.

the only thing i changed in this recipe was instead of garlic cloves i used 1/2 tsp garlic salt.....and what happened....well everything was okay until i went to turn the ribs.....the sauce that was poured over top of them on the sheet was bubbling over the side of the sheet and was starting to burn.....it was burned onto the edges of the sheet in some areas....i definetely will NOT try this recipe again!!!!!

This was a WONDERFUL recipe!  I was looking for something that was easy, fairly quick and didn't require an overnight process.  The only change I made was the temp., 350 degrees, and next time I'll cook the pork for 5 - 10 less.  Thank you so much for sharing this with Allrecipes.com!

Tried this with chicken. Too sweet for my taste. Also sauce was very runny, was hoping it would be a little thicker, maybe adding some flour to the sauce (which i didn't think of then)...anyway, it is not bad but could still be improved.

I had five pounds of ribs I bought on sale and don't know how to cook them.  I dislike recipes that require hours of marination and cooking because I am an on the fly cook so this recipe appealed to me.  I found it in the Allrecipes cook book.  I read the reviews and boiled for an hour then baked.  I doubled the sauce (use a BIG bowl because the sauce foams up like a volcano) I baked for an hour maybe a little less.  The sauce got burnt to the ribs.  It was kinda icky to me, but I never liked barbaque and that is the way barbaque chicken on the grill tastes.  My fiancee who loves that kind of stuff said they were so so.  We cheated and ordered the side dishes from a delivery chinese place so at least I had that.  If I do try this again I will do it to recipe specifications.  But I don't see how me pre boiling the ribs made the sauce like that.  Clean up was okay because I placed hot water and dawn in the glass baking dish as soon as they were done.

These turned out wonderful. I did what other reviewers suggested and boiled the ribs first for two hours, before covering them with the sauce and baking them for 25 mintues. Needless to say we had no leftovers that night.

This was the best and the easiest rib recipe that I have ever come across.  For someone who has little time to mess around before dinner begins, this recipe left me plenty of time to run around and prepare the rest of my large dinner.  Thank you to whomever posted this recipe.  My dinner guests and I truly enjoyed it!  Oh by the way, the left over sauce was wonderful with Garlic Mashed Potatos!

My family politely said the ribs were good & buried them in ketchup 9which is typically on.y used for hamburgers & fries).  Don't think we've quite aquired the taste for this type of ribs... maybe if I had left out the soy sauce.  The after tast was nasty.  Everyone was ready for a sweet desert.

These honey garlic ribs are the best.  I put some of the left over sauce on brown rice that I made to go with the meal. Better than the Chinese Restaurant.

These are just AWESOME!!  The flavor is wonderful..but the mess is not.  Thank God, I own Pampered Chef stoneware and even the stickiest burnt on mess comes off with ease!  If I did NOT have my stoneware, I think I would buy a disposable pan for these, but believe me, the slight cost would be worth it!  I intend to make these again and again.  We used thick, meaty ribs this first time, but I look forward to using a rack of ribs next time.  Beware the mess..but WELL worth it!  Just be prepared.

My family loves this sauce on ribs, chicken wings and pork chops.  It has a nice light flavour and is not overpowering.  I'm thinking of cooking meatballs in the sauce next.

Fiance and I both love this recipe.  Flavor is great with the pork!  It would probably be great for chicken too.  I baked mine in a 9 x 13 pyrex and didn't have too hard of a time with cleanup.  Took out the ribs right away and put hot water in the dish.

GREAT STUFF!  I doubled the sauce and use pork tenderloin.  This way we do not need to fuss with the fat on the ribs.  I also cooked in a glass pan without the foil.  This is now a regular for the family!

This recipe is great used as a marinade for pork or chicken (marinade it overnight is best). I had to double the recipe for 6lbs. of ribs but it was worth it. I also added a little more garlic. So next time it's chicken!!!

They were absolutely delicious!!!  My husband and I LOVED them.  However I ruined my pan.  It was so bad I had to throw the pan away.  The sauce got under the tin foil.  Next time I'm using a disposable pan.  I emailed this recipe to a friena and the same thing happened to her.

These ribs were really excellent.  I would suggest that you marinate the ribs in this sauce overnight so that the ribs fall off the bone.  But overall these were the best ribs I ever tasted from anyone's kitchen.

The honey and garlic is a great combination. If I could make this, anyone can.  My 4 year old said,"Mommy I want this for dinner every night".
It's definitely a meal worth repeating!

This was very easy and my kids loved it.  Next time I'll make sure I add a bit more garlic salt.  Seemed like it could have used it.  Used Chinese style ribs. Its a keeper.

This tasted terrific. Next time I don't think I will pour on all the sauce because it overflowed into my oven.

Easy and VERY tasty! LOVED It and have emailed it to all my friends & family.  One tip is to baste the meat periodically to ensure great carmelized coating.  Served with a combo of white & brown rice with chopped broccolli.  Can't wait to make it again!!!
