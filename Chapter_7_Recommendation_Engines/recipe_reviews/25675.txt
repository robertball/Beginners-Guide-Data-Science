This was the best stew I have ever made.  Often, recipes I see have onion soup mix for flavor, but not this one.  Nice thick brown gravy, hearty stew for the winter.  I will be using this recipe going forward.  Thanks for sharing.

To make the stew thicker, toss your meat with the flour BEFORE you brown the meat (I used 1/2 cup).  Make sure your oil is hot (flour will bubble away when you sprinkle a little in it) before adding meat.  I also added diced onions during this step instead of the pearl onions later.  After the floured meat is browned, I then added water and followed the recipe as written.  The stew was the perfect color and consistancy when made this way.  As far as taste, it was great all except for the peas.  They were a little overwhelming in flavor.  I think it may have been better to have them cook a little longer so the flavors would mingle better.  Or maybe use canned peas which don't have quite as intense of a flavor as the frozen variety I used.

This was a nice, overall tasty stew recipe.  I didn't have any pearl onions - so I subbed reg onions, and I omitted the peas.  Also, I added two more bay leaves & a dash of crushed rosemary and like another, ended up having to thicken it even more w/ some additional cornstarch (I used cornstarch instead of flour). A "nice" fall dinner  - great with a loaf of crusty bread. Thanks Debbie.

This was good, I also put it in the crockpot & skipped the oil.  It took a bit more flour & some cornstarch to thicken the gravy, but it was good.  Thanks Debbie!

My family loved this recipe.  It tastes very similar to a famous brand of canned stew, but improved because it isn't as greasy.  I made a few changes:  just dumped the ingredients in a crockpot and cooked it all day, omitted the oil, flour and peas.  It came out thick and tasty!

This is a very nice basic stew recipe.  Easy to prepare and very tasty going down.   I modified it a bit.  I confess that one of my pet peeves is people who modify recipes beyond recogniition.  But I believe in being flexible too, so, here are my modifications:  First, I browned the beef with olive oil and added a little salt and white pepper to the beef while browning.  I didn't dredge the beef in flour prior to browning because that would interfere with caramelizing the sugars in the beef.  Second, the can of pearl onions did not sound appetizing to me, so I picked some pearl onions out of my garden and added them to the beef while browning it to caramelize them, bring out their flavor, and add to the flavor and texture of the gravy.  Third, I added two beef bullion cubes to the 3 cups of water and cut back on the salt.   I also used sea salt.  Fourth, I cut the potatoes and carrots a little smaller to suit my taste.  Fifth, I added just a lttle fresh rosemary and thyme out of my garden to it to add a little more wild flavor.  Sixth, I added the peas about 5 minutes before thickening the gravy.  It was delicious, and the leftovers held up well, too.

loved it...turned out perfect and smelled so yummy cooking.  An extra bonus all three of my kids liked it which is unusual.  I used fresh onions as well instead of pearl onions.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family thought this recipe was fantastic.  My husband had been searching for a stew recipe that was "like his mom used to make", and we've found it.  In fact, the meat is so tender that it's even better than hers!

This stew was so hearty and flavorful. I especially liked the crispness of the peas and the way the meat just feel apart and enriched the stew. It is perfect for autumn evenings. I served it with Pumpkin bread. YUM!

This stew was so yummy! I never can seem to get my seasoning just right for stew but this was perfect. I used diced onion cooked along with the beef, just not sure my kids would have been a fan of pearl onions. I used canned peas at the end just a preference. This will be my new go to recipe for stew! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Comfort food at its best!  I coated the beef in flour before cooking it and omitted the peas (just don't like them).  Since I coated the beef in flour, I did not need to add flour later.  I did, as a result of coating the beef in flour, have to add water a couple of times to maintain the sauce consistency.  Good stuff Maynard!

OMG!! This stew really hit the spot and it was SO EASY!!  I subtracted the onions (not a fan) and added a package of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix.  My husband was one happy boy after this meal!

good filling winter nourishment - for a budget dinner i used stewing steak, a lower temperature and cooked a little longer. the paprika gives it that bit extra that made the family ask for more!

Loved it...  I carmelized fresh onions in the oil at the beginning instead of using canned onions.  I also threw in some baby carrots.  I couldn't keep my spoon out of the pot all afternoon!!

This was really good, and worth the wait. I used corn instead of peas (don't like peas), and cut up one onion instead of doing the can of onions. I also left out the bay leaf. To make it a bit thicker, I used 1/3 cup flour instead of 1/4. My one complaint is that it took much longer than 20 minutes for the potatoes and carrots to become tender, but the end result of the stew was tasty enough to where it didn't matter so much. This is just like the stews everyone's mother, grandmother, etc. make on chilly days.

I was looking for something to do with  sirloin tips when I found this recipe.  I made the recipe as written, reducing by half for our small family.  I had some leftover peas that I added at the last minute.  Sounded kind of odd to add peas, but it really was a nice addition.  Reminded me of Dinty Moore stew - but fresh!  Somehow I didn't have as much gravy as I thought it should.  Maybe next time I will add a bit more water... 

This one was a hit, even with my husband who declared he does not like stew!  Will definitely make this one again.

All the hungry guys in my house LOVED this recipe.  It helps to cook this the amount of time specified.   Serving sweet dinner rolls with this to dip in the gravy is the crowning touch.

I think this recipe would be better if the fat and oil is drained after browning the beef instead of using it for gravy.  The beef fat and oil sort of add a musky taste to the stew.

I thought it turned out ok, although, it's still in the fridge and no one will eat it. I encountered a problem during the cooking process. While the stew was simmering for 2.5 hours, most of the liquids evaporated. So, I had to add another 2 cups of water to cook the potatoes and carrots. I still didn't feel like there was enough liquid to cook 4 potatoes as the recipes called so I only added half. Taste wise, I thought it tasted like Dinty Moore. And I am not a fan. If I were to make it again, I'd  add wine to the broth.

This was exactly what I was looking for when I decided to make stew!  Thank you!  I didn't have some ingredients, like lemon juice, peas, or the canned onions.  So, I just left them out and used a fresh onion instead.  It turned out so yummy.  This will be a favorite for years, thanks.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did make a couple changes:  I didn't have any peas so I left those out, and I used a regular onion instead of the pearl onions.  I also had no Worcestershire sauce so I used a popular name-brand steak sauce.  All in all, we very much enjoyed it and I will be making it (my way) again!

Better than most.  I omitted the sugar and added extra Worcestershire sauce and potatoes.  I aslo added corn and Kitchen Bouquet.  I'll use this one again but next time I will use chopped fresh onions rather than the canned tiny onions since I didn't care for their texture.

I had to give this stew 5 stars based on the following:  I followed recipe to the tee.  The only change was a can of sweet peas minus can juice at the end.  I also followed a previous review and tossed sirloin in flour prior to cooking in oil.  Family loved it.  I loved it.  This is the perfect dish on a cold New England night, so I guess we will be enjoying it regular.

I loved this recipe, although my husband (who prefers a stronger and spicier flavor) wasn't as thrilled. We didn't have Worcestershire so we used some soy, added spinach, and cut up a regular onion instead. I also forgot the flour, which I'll put in next time. It was very tasty and we'll be making this again.

Not too shabby! Came out a little too thick for our taste, and we didn't even use all of the flour....so I don't know what happened.
