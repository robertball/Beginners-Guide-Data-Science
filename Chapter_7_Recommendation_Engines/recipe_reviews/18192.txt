These are great. I had been buying meringue cookies at the grocery store for $5 a package--these are so much cheaper to make and taste a lot better!! I suggest making them before bed and leaving them to dry until morning (don't forget to turn off the oven!!), because mine were not dryed out after 20 minutes.

Forget the vinegar! I only used half the vinegar called for in this recipe and they still tasted of it!

I've been looking for my Mom's recipe for these! She used to use cherry Jello and made half with maraschino cherry bits and half with mini chocolate chips. Same recipe right down to using brown paper bags instead of parchment! Thanks for posting this!

I left out the vinegar based on the other reviews, but they turned out way too sweet for our liking. My 5 year old wouldn't even eat them. My 2 year old devoured them, though, so I guess it's all about personal taste. Left them overnight in the oven, too. The fruity (1 batch raspberry, 1 cherry) taste was quite a bit too strong, so I think less gelatin would fix both problems.

I have made these for at least 20 years. They are always requested at Christmas as a family favorite. Now my daughter makes them for her children. Keep the baking temp at 250 or they will brown. I bake them for 30 min. and then shut off the oven and let them dry completely-- until the oven is cool.

I made 2 batches of these cookies. One lime and one raspberry. The lime ones turned out good with a nice light flavor but the raspberry ones were heavy. Both were salty and neither took 20 minutes to dry out. It was more like 6 or 7 hours.

Great stuff!  I used cherry gelatin and omitted the vinegar...they were great on the Valentine's Day treat table.

Great recipe but came out too chewy in spite of leaving them in the oven for 4 hours after baking

Very fun, pretty easy!  I made this twice.  One time I dropped it by the spoonful.  The next time, I put it in a bag and piped it out, so they were smaller.  I didn't use vinegar on either batch, and we really liked them!

The jello offers a faint strawberry flavor and a touch of pink that's very pleasing. This is a lot of sugar - I used four egg whites and that was prefect for the other ingredients listed. The texture wasn't quite right when they were fresh, but the next day they were perfect.
