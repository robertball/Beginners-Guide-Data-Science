1.10.16   Oh my, this surprised me...it's REALLY good!  My first time using tofu in a cake and my first time using PB2 peanut butter powder.  This cake was incredibly moist, incredibly easy, incredibly tasty, and has incredible eye appeal!!   The topping was done after 30 seconds in the microwave, and had a rich chocolate-peanut butter flavor. I did add a few chopped peanuts as a garnish.   I seldom buy cake mixes but wouldn't hesitate to buy another to make this again...and again...and again.  My sweet tooth is doing the happy dance.  Jessica Croisant, thanks for sharing your recipe. >>>>>UPDATE>>>>> Did a variation on this recipe today  using swiss chocolate cake mix, white chocolate chips, and garnished with some strawberries and blueberries.  As always, turned out delicious!

Great recipe. I would never have thought to use soft tofu to replace the eggs and oil in the cake mix recipe.  It tastes very good, has substantially fewer calories, and reduces the fat content while adding protein  The only change I made to the recipe is that I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I made it with water instead of coffee (as suggested).  It turned out perfect and everyone loved it!

This cake is awesome! I'm not a tofu fan but we loved this. My kids thought it was great. nobody realized it was made with tofu. Completely satisfied my chocolate sweet tooth.

Just scrumptious. Delightfully moist with a light, tender crumb. So easy to make, too, with minimal clean-up after. I anticipate making this again and again.

Excellent! I made the cake, didn't change anything, but didn't make the frosting. It seems really thick and has an almost poofy batter compared to regular cake batter. I prefer my chocolate cake cold anyway so stored it in the refrigerator. It was thick, dense, rich; reminded me of chocolate cake you get at restaurants. I've already made it a second time, seems easier than following regular box mix directions.
