It is true that this recipe is easy, but it wasn't great.  I have been making the other pineapple stuffing recipe on this site for years, but when I saw this one I liked that it used less eggs and no butter.  We had a bake off and I made both recipes today and the kids and I had both.  The other recipe browned up better and tasted better (probably due to the butter).

I thought that this was good, but everyone over for easter loved it!  My father inlaw even said it was outrageous.  I liked the ingredients in this recipe better than others.

I have now made this twice, and it was a BIG hit both times!  I brought it to a family gathering where I had no idea what else would be served.  We wound up eating it with pizza.  Delish!  Last night, I made it as a side dish to Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker, another Allrecipes.com winner.

The taste of this was ok- just like a sweet bread- and it was easy to make. It didn't have the texture of the stuffing I'm used to (separated cubes of moist bread). It baked into a solid piece which we cut into squares to serve. I won't make it again - but it wasn't horrible - just nothing special.

This was delicious! It went so well with our ham dinner. It was so good that there was none left.  It tasted like sweet bread kind of danish.  It was a nice touch without making rolls. It was a good option for something different.

This is fabulous. My son likes to keep some for breakfast and puts maple syrup on it. It is wonderful as a side dish or a dessert. You could even add marashino cherries chopped up if you want it as a dessert.

This gets a "5" because this is the third EasterI have made this recipe. It is very easy to prepare, and is gone in a flash at the dinner table. It really surprises people. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe was super simple and quick to make.  
I was a side dish to a pork roast and seasoned corn.  Also, I have plenty of leftovers and have been eating it for lunch.  Next time I will try using part of an Italian loaf instead of the white bread (maybe adding some milk to soften the crustier bread.)
