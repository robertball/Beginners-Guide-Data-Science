Just made this recipe for a fundraiser at my library featuring Cape Cod foods (cranberries in this case.)  Major plusses:   it only took a few minutes to make since I used packaged shredded cheese AND it can be made a few days ahead.   BUT it does need more flavor.  On the recommendation of previous reviewers,   I doubled the spices,  and increased the dried cranberries to 1/2 cup.  I added Worcerstershire Sauce to taste (beginning at 1 teaspoon) and  also used the sharpest grated cheddar I could find.  Finally,  just before serving with crackers, I sprinkled 1/2 cup of toasted slivered almonds (obtained already toasted from Trader Joe's)  over the top of the cheese.  So easy and very flavorful with the increased flavorings.  I'll make it again for guests and potlucks.

This needs to sit for awhile for the flavors to blend.  It is great with chipotle pepper instead of cayenne for a smoky flavor.  For those who want a zippier spread, try a minced jalapeno pepper.

Not stellar, but still very good. This was mild & had no "wow factor". 

Here is what I did: used extra sharp cheddar cheese, used mayo instead of the milk, doubled the spices & used about 1/4 cup of the cranberries (which I chopped in the food processor before using.)

You definatley need to use the extra spices & berries. I can't imagine using only 2 T berries. Just eye-ball it - trust me, you need the extra berries.You might even want to throw in your favorite spices to jazz it up.

I would suggest using this as a base to play with until you get a flavor you like.

I enjoyed the combination of flavors in this spread. I added a little garlic powder although it was a little too powerful the next day. This tastes great on celery sticks.

This was ok. I made it as part of a holiday feast for company, and chose not to serve it because it was rather bland, with just an aftertaste of cayenne tingling. It seems to be missing something-- maybe spicy brown mustard or Worchestershire or brown sugar... I may try again, or I may not.

This was ok ... it was easy to make, but needs more spices - if i make it again i'll use dijon mustard and tabasco and lots of them.

I loved this.  It definitely isn't just your plain old cheese slices.

I was very disappointed. Brought this to a book club meeting.  Nobody could even taste the cayenne or mustard and even the cranberries were lackluster!!  Tasted like cream cheese with some added cheese.  I can't believe somebody actually REDUCED the spices for a better flavor.

I doubled the amount of dried cranberries and only used half of the mustard powder and cayenne.
Next time, I'll use regular cheddar instead of sharp; sharp had a bit of a strongbitter taste in this.

10.28.18  The recipe doesn’t say to mix by hand or with a mixer, but I used my hand mixer.  The texture was very good on this, but I added even more cayenne and mustard powder to add more “zip.” I liked the flavor contrast that the sweet cranberries brought to the spread.   Could just be personal taste preference, but I’ll cut back a little on the cream cheese next time and add more cheddar.  Good recipe, just needs a few little changes to make us really happy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Excellent!  Very well received at Thanksgiving.  It is much, much better the day after and if it is allowed to sit at room temp for awhile!  My new favorite spread!
