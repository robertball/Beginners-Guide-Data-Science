These were a hit, and my 9 year old daughter was able to help since they're so easy to make.  I didn't use the sauce since the pies are perfect on their own, but I think it would make a nice ice cream topping.  So, next time if I need extra calories, I'll add a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with the sauce ; )!  Delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

Recipe Group Selection:  04, May 2013 ~ DELICIOUS!  We loved it!  I really liked it and I am not a crust lover, at all.  I could handle the piece on top.  I only had 4 cups of berries, so I made the 4 dishes and skipped the berry sauce.  The bake time was right on with my oven.  I thought the cinnamon was a little overbearing, but DH did not.  Since I’m the baker, next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut the amount in half.  I served them warm with a scoop of frozen vanilla yogurt.  Not being a very good baked fruit pie maker, I must have cut my slits too wide because you can tell by the picture a lot of juice seeped out.  I’ll do better next time.  The final look of the dessert certainly did not take away from the taste.  My package of frozen berries consisted of:  Unsweetened strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and red raspberries.  Good selection this week.

I altered this quite a bit to suit my needs, but it was still quite nice, and super easy. Used a mixture of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and peaches because that's what I had in the freezer!! My alterations are in the notes section.

Really easy and extremely yummy. I didn't save the extra berries, just made another pie instead. I also made my own pie crust. The presentation of little pies just looks so beautiful. Next time I might add a little orange zest to the berry mixture. I had used a combo of strawberries, blackberries and blueberries.

I used this recipe exactly as directed for the pie filling the way that I made the pies was slightly different because I made mini pies using a muffin pan. The filling was wonderful, easy, and got amazing reviews from friends and family who had them! Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group selection for May 4, 2013 -   This is very good but I thought the cinnamon was too aggressive for the mixed fruit I was using.  Next time I would use less.  I made the Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust on this site that you might consider using because it’s also quick and easy.  You have to love a fast, simple and delicious dessert.  Thanks for sharing!

Made these for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! I happened to have some mini pie pans and decided to use those instead of the ramekins, so I could make a bottom crust as well. The whole family devoured these! So simple to make and the end result was wonderful...I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is one of those recipes that proves that sometimes, fewer ingredients/steps make the best dishes.  Simple comfort food at it's best.  I used fresh mixed berries and it turned out awesome.  This will be a staple in my kitchen but I am wondering to myself, why didn't I think of this before!?

Made this with the smaller ramekins, which is perfect for dessert al la mode. I filled six little ones easily. I also made my own crust. Not a fan of the store-bought stuff. Will definitely make this again.

I bought frozen mixed berries for smoothies, but the kids didn't care for them, so I was looking for something else to make.  These were perfect.   I followed the recipe exactly and got tons of complements.  Will be making these again.
