So I made this today with great trepidation.  (Will it work, will it taste good, will it be worth it?)  Conclusion - yes, yes, yes.  Even better - it wasn't really a lot of work.  I used the leftovers to make an apple crisp and it is GOOD!!  I would say this recipe is the standard 'sweetness' of a bakery applie pie, but we don't like things too sweet so on the second batch I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, using Granny Smith apples which are a bit tart.  The apples positively shine!  I'm definitely going to be using this recipe this fall when the apple crop comes in!  Note:  if you want to make this in quarts, double the recipe for 7 quarts and process for 25 minutes.  It takes about 2 quarts to make one 9" pie.

Folks, if you're going to make this, follow the recipe exactly. Do *not* substitute regular cornstarch for the jam/jelly Clear Jel. You must use ClearJel which is kind of hard to find at markets (at the present time). Using cornstarch can interfere with the bacteria heat killing process and is not recommended by the USDA.  If you're unable to find ClearJel, you can still can your filling, and then simply add flour or cornstarch after you open the jar (simmer with flour for 5 minutes or mix flour & melted butter together and add it to your filling before baking).

I was simply terrified to make this recipe, because this was my first time making something like this; I've pickled before. To cut to the end of it. . . it was really easy. We used apples that our children had picked, which we have in abundance of, that are mostly Macintosh and Cortland.  We tested them in pastries and the were delish, and our girls all approved. The one thing that I would change is the amount of sugar to 2 cups, like one of the reviewers had mentioned; we don't eat a lot of sugary things. 

Looking forward to making a lot more.

Thought the cinnamon and nutmeg were too strong.

I made this recipe for canning but used 18 apples and adjusted the recipe. I found I had to use more spices then the recipe called for and added a touch of clove and ginger. While the taste is yummy I had one jar bust on the bottom before I even got the,

Preyty much followed the  recipe to follow. I added Bartlett pears.  Apples were not overcooked.
