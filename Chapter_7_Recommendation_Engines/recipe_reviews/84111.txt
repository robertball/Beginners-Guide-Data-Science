I was very disappointed with this recipe, I had high hopes for it! I followed the recipe perfectly except that I could not find sun dried tomatoes so I used cherry tomatoes instead.  The I also added some peppers for color and mushrooms for flavor.  The dish just wasn't impressive, and I was over all disappointed.  Not what I expected from an allrecipes recipe.

Loved it, loved it!  Easy and quick and taste divine.  I served over fettunci pasta with a spinach salad and served with a white zin.  No one guessed how easy it was to whip up!

Trying to figure out what to do with some colossal shrimp I had in the freezer, I happened upon this recipe. Am I glad I didn't save them for grilling! Loved, loved, loved it, particularly with the big shrimp. I think they probably worked out better as they take a little longer to cook, and so wouldn't get overcooked in the process. I didn't have cognac so substituted dry sherry, and because I love them, I added capers to the mix. Also, just because I had some on hand, I threw in a handful of grape tomatoes right toward the end. That way they just warmed and didn't pop from the heat. I served it over egg noodles. Thanks for the great take on shrimp!

loved this dish.  the only changes that i made were to add a few slices of pancetta, diced, to the garlic and shallots.  i did use the hot pepper flakes, and i used heavy cream instead of the half and half.

This recipe LIED...I don't see how it can POSSIBLY feed 4 people...the 2 of us put it away quite nicely (and I would have had more, if there had been any!). I used brandy intead of cognac, added cherry tomatoes to warm through, and served over rice spaghetti (for my gluten-intolerant sweetie)...I will be making this one again, for sure!!

Easy and very very good.  For those like me that might find it just a little tame, add 1/4 cup of diced kalamata olives for a little more powerful flavor.

Sorry, I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband and I did not care for this at all. The cognac really overpowered the dish, that is all you could taste. The sauce was also extremely thin and needed to be thickened up. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

I like to substitute a lot. :) Since I didn't have half-and-half, I used evaporated milk (just about 1/3 C) with about 1 tsp. sugar. I also omitted the tomatoes, and used cayenne pepper (just a dash) rather than red pepper flakes. To save time, I tossed the shrimp in frozen, rather than thawing them first. Was very good over rotini noodles and I would make some variety of this again; might be even better if I made it as suggested! :)

Gross! Threw it out.  What a waste of cognac, which by the way is NOT cheap. Yuck, yuck, yuck!

Wounderful flavor, very easy to make, colors brilliant. I added yellow bell pepper(to go with the red tomatoes)and also mushrooms. Served on a bed of angel hair pasta, and a side of fresh olive bread. Surely to impress!

This was delicious though I didn't use sun-dried tomatoes as I don't care for them. The sauce took more than 5 minutes to thicken, but it was great.

This was pretty tasty.  Rice took longer to cook that the recipe states so if I were to cook it again I'd hold off on adding the veges.  I don't like overcooked veges.  I don't know if I needed the Cognac either.  Think it would have been fine without it.

A combination of some of our favorites: shallots (we used pearl onions, as we had them on hand), sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic!  Added some extra sun-dried tomatoes, and a tablespoon or so of lemon juice (as other shrimp cognac beurre blanc recipes suggested - glad we did so, as may have been a bit bland without).  But we otherwise followed the recipe as noted.  (Though my bag of shrimp was only 10 oz., but we preferred as such, as it made for extra sauce.)  Would be exceptional over pasta (whole grain especially).  The sauce did take some time to thicken, but will definitely make again.  (We had a "taste off."  My husband preferred allrecipes.com "Basil Shrimp" and I preferred this one.  So to each his own, though it's important to note the basil shrimp recipe was actually better as a leftover, as the flavors had time to intensify.)  Appreciated this was a lighter spin on the classic shrimp cognac beurre blanc recipe!

Followed the recipe to the letter, and wasn't disappointed.   Only change was using heavy cream (had it on hand) instead of half-and-half which I admit added to the creaminess of this recipe. An elegant, impressive, and simple meal that I'd serve to company without hesitation.  If you're looking for bold flavors, this isn't for you.  This cream sauce is delicate and smooth.  I only had medium-size shrimp in the freezer and, quite honestly, they were a little freezer burned.  In spite of that, they turned out tender and succulent.  My husband kept saying how much he liked this, so I suspect we may be having this quite often.  Looks like the reviews for this recipe are all over the place, but I wouldn't change a thing.  Jade, thanks for a fabulous new shrimp recipe.

I just made this recipe for my wife and we both liked it a lot.  The only change I made was to use whipping cream instead of half and half to avoid the problems others have had with the sauce being too thin.  The sauce was a perfect consistency.  If I had let it simmer much longer, it would have been too thick.  Some thoughts about the recipe ... I would not substitute for either the sun-dried tomatoes or the cognac.  The recipe needs the slightly richer flavours of both and the particular flavours complement each other nicely.  Normal tomatoes, including cherry tomatoes, have too much water in them and the taste is too mild.  One might get away with substituting brandy for the cognac, but red wine would probably not work.  One thing to watch out for is that sun-dried tomatoes vary quite a bit in how salty they taste.  Try a small piece before making this recipe and adjust the added salt accordingly.

I got rave reviews on this recipe.  So quick and easy, but with good flavor.  I found the sundried tomatoes lost some of their flavor when heated.  Would suggest you add the sun dried tomatoes just before you are ready to serve.  Lovely

I always get a kick of reading the reviews. some times they are helpful with people adding their own twist. my favorite are those that say, "I followed it exactly except....." then rate it bad. the except is usually a key ingredient. in this case use the sun dried tomatos in oil. I am attempting to make this with a little more sauce for a great creamy shrimp and grits. I'll be making simple grit cakes with cheese and jalapenos. great recipe.

I made this recipe per the directions and it is amazing we combined it with some spinach noodles and a little bit of Asiogo cheese on top I will be making this again. I did have to thicken the sauce but it is a great dish

Love it. I replaced dried tomatos  with tomato sauce. I like a little kick (spicy ) so I added a little cayenne pepper (not flakes) to all shrimp. I tried leeks years ago with another recipe I do not prefer them. I used regular onions. Served  over chili tomato noodles. ????????

Loved it but did not put liquor in it.
