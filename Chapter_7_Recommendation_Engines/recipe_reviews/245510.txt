Made recipe last Christmas season. The recipe works well as is, and does not need any alterations. It's really great if you like dark chocolate, caramel, and sea salt together. Yum!

Yum! Big, chunky chocolate chip caramel cookies. I forgot the chocolate drizzle on the top, but sprinkled with sea salt. No loss of chocolate gooey-ness.
