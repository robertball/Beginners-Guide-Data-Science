I scaled down the recipe, easily, to four servings. It was wonderful! I even used "light" mayo to make it healthier. Tasted very similiar to Captain D's Tartar sauce! Thanks!

I hate the stuff, but hubby loves it.  Unfortunately for him since he doesn't eat it enough, I never buy it.  He was delighted when I found this recipe.  The great thing is...everything you need is probably already in your pantry.  The only thing I did differently was to use dill relish (instead of chopping up the pickles).  He said it was really good and he liked being able to have his tartar sauce.  Thanks for the post.

Oh Boy.  I was so excited to try this, but for some reason it came out so terrible... I had to ask my husband to help me "fix" it :-(  I really couldn't even begin to guess what to do to repair the damage. Part of the problem I think was that I used the All Recipes calculator to reduce the serving amount to 6, and somehow, the amount of Mayo seemed incorrect. My husband added about a heaped teaspoon of dijon mustard, and about a half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. It wasn't perfect, but it at least made it palatable. I will retry this one using a larger amount of servings,and see if it changes the results any. Unfortunately I can't give this one a good rating right now :-(

This is super quick and easy. I usually mix it up when I put the fish and chips in the oven. It's great with a dash of cayenne pepper added in too.

I of course scaled this recipe down as I didn't need a quart, and I found the onions to be overwhelming, there were just to many.  I added some pepper as well.  Almost like the other recipe I use, but just too many onions.  Thanks Marlene.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I've never had store bought tartar sauce, I always just mixed dill relish with mayo. I wanted to find something with a little more complex flavor.  Family loved it.  I will definatly keep using this recipe.  Scaled recipe way down and used dill relish instead of chopping a pickle.  Soooo good!

This was awesome.  I do not like tartar with sweet pickles...This was perfect.  I scaled down to 4 servings, seeing I am the only one in my house that will eat it, but it was great...

The perfect compliment to frozen, bland, breaded fish pattys (our dinner).  It really gave the fish sandwiches we had a nice zing!  I did have a fresh lemon on hand, which really added to the taste.  I also scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, a great plenty if you only need it for one meal.  Bratwurst, Potato and Cabbage Soup, from the allrecipes website, rounded out a decent, inexpensive, easy, and tasty dinner at our house tonight.

Super sauce - went well with our frozen fish fillets and fries tonight. If it seems like a lot you can also set some aside, add mustard and stir through boiled potato chunks for a quick potato salad dressing!

This tartar sauce is so easy to make.  We don't eat fish very often, so I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings and we ate it all in one night.  I made it just minutes before I served it-- it was tasty even without letting all the flavors blend.  I love the kick the lemon adds!

Hubs requested I pack him the fixin's for a fish sandwich with tartar sauce for his lunch with the leftover fish from our supper. I was very pleased with this good, basic tartar sauce, one of the few I could find that didn't call for sweet pickle relish, which I didn't want for the herbed fish I needed it for. I added a few capers which made it slightly piquant - delicious, and perfect for this particular fish sandwich.

OMG!! I have finally found it.  I love Captain D's tartar sauce. Now I can make my own!!. I made this recipe by dividing every ingredient in half!  It is perfect! I also chopped the onion super fine.  I can't even tell they are in there except that the flavor is PERFECT!! Try Schwan's batter crisp cod and you have a perfect meal. THANKS ALLRECIPES!

Pretty good. I made it as directed (but cut it down) and thought it could use a little something else. I added a little Dijon mustard and a dash of Tabasco and they really made it delicious!

This is a very good tartar sauce as is, however, this time I tried a bit of horseradish in it. It was excellent with salmon patties from this site.
Take into consideration that it makes a load of sauce.

This is a good base recipe, and I always start my sauce off with those four ingredients and then add some chopped capers and a splash of the brine they're packed in for an extra bit of zing.

I wasn't crazy about the lemon flavor in this as it was pretty strong. I usually add a little vinegar to my tartar, and I like it better that way apparently. Thanks anyhow!

Yummy!!! I reduced it to 10 servings which reduced it to about a cup (more than needed, but I like room to play). I added a tsp of raw horseradish, a dash of cayenne, and a touch of fresh ground pepper. I'm sure you can tell we like it spicy ;) It turned out better than anything I could buy in the store. Thanks!!

This recipe is very easy and very quick. And, it tastes wonderful! I hate the sweetness of the store bought brands. I think they're geared towards a child's taste for sugary stuff. I use well drained dill relish instead of chopping up a pickle to save time and I omit the lemon juice as it seems to make the relish a little too salty for me.

This is exactly how my family has made tartar sauce for a gazillion years........for way less servings at a time though.  :)  Sometimes I leave the lemon juice out and it is still great.  I will only use Farman Dill Pickles, no other pickle measures up.

I love the tang of McD's tartar sauce and had been looking for a copykat recipe for years.  This one has the tang I had been looking for. I also add some finely chopped garlic too. I have made it for extended family and always get rave reviews!

My husband, the tartar sauce critic, made this sauce last night and loved it.  We have been looking for a good recipe for years.  I think the onion is what makes the difference.  We did not have any lemon or dill pickles, so used dill relish and a little of the relish liquid.  It was great.  Be sure to finely dice the onions and let the mixture sit for a while so the flavors meld.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made fish and chips for dinner and realized I had no tartar to serve with it... I quickly jumped on Allrecipes and looked up tartar sauce recipes. I chose this recipe because it seemed simple and I knew I had the ingredients on hand. The only thing I was missing was dill pickles, but I had dill relish. I quickly threw the recipe together and added enough dill relish to the sauce to taste and we all really enjoyed it. I doubt I will ever buy store bought tartar again! This was simple and easy. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty! I would guess that the quality of lemon and onion is very important here! I used a sweet vidalia 
onion and made sure to use a very fresh lemon! So simple and yummy!

Really good Marlene. Whipped this up to accompany the soft shell crabs I made for my daughter's birthday dinner. I prefer my crabs naked, but hubby wanted the sauce to use on his sandwich. I tasted and thought that this recipe was certainly worth a repeat. Thanks!

Yummy!!!Scaled to 2.5, used sweet relish (my fav for everything) and oinion powder b/c I dont keep onions on hand.  The oinion powder made it b/c I kept adding until I got the tartar sauce taste I was looking for (like LJS or Capt. D's).  Delish!!!  I will NEVER again buy tartar sauce.  And, it doesn't have to sit, just eat!!!

I used this recipe to make tartar sauce for the first time, easily halved the recipe, and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone said that it was the best tartar they'd ever had! I didn't add quite as much onion, and probably a little extra pickle, but it had such simple, yet delicious flavor! This will be my go-to tartar sauce recipe!

I scaled this recipe down to 10 servings the original is 40. I used a vidalia onion and Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. I made it in the food processor. I have to say it was the best tarter sauce I have ever eaten. I think the sweet vidalia onion was the key ingredient.

Great Job on such a simple item! No more wasting money on the tarter sauce my b/f enjoys from a grocery store. AND, it's preservative free! I hate tarter sauce (mayo and sweet pickle). But, this one.... it's great for him, and with some minor tweaking will be outta this world for me. Thanx

My husband loved this!  He likes a little "zing" to his tarter sauce so I did add about 1 Tablespoon of horse radish.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out with that extra ingredient added, but it turned out great for us. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the recipe! It was great. We actually didn't have any lemon juice on hand this evening when I made it but it tasted just great without it. The only changes I made was to add some salt and instead of chopping up a dill pickle I used dill relish. It was delicious, I will definitely make it again!

I scaled down to 8 servings.  I only added a little onion powder because I wanted more onion flavor and added about a tablespoon of sweet relish in addition to the dill.  And of course some freshly ground pepper and  pinch of salt.  The recipe is good just as it is written, I only adjusted to suit my tastes.

This is exactly what I was looking for, and is what good tartar sauce is supposed to taste like.  Letting it sit overnight is key.  If you don't, it will just taste like mayonnaise. This recipe is going in my permanent file, I'll never need to look for another one.

I scaled this down to only 4 servings.  And sure the measurements were a bit odd, but it turned out great.  It's your very basic tartar sauce.  I didn't add onions because I thought they'd be a bit overpowering in the small amount I made. It reminded me a lot of the tartar sauce my mom made.  To really help the flavor be sure to refrigerate.  This is an easy recipe to play with and I'm sure I'll be enjoying using this as a base for many variants.

This portion is good for a good ole southern fish fry. I make it using the dill relish and I also add some garlic powder. We use it for fish sticks as well.

This was wonderfull!  The only change I made was that I grated the onion instead of using diced, and that was only so that the people who don't like onion wouldn't see it in the sauce.  It was great and I will use this from now on.  Blows bottled sauces out of the water!

I made Tartar Sauce I the other day and gave it five stars even tho I made some changes.  Now today looking at other recipes (because I'm going to make it again) I found that the changes I made match this recipe almost exactly.  So anyway, this recipe is a hit in my house.

I just served this with Crispy Fish Fillets (from this site. YUM! What a fantastic meal!!! I will NEVER purchase store-bought Tartar again! Since there are just two of us, I cut the recipe to 1 cup mayo, 1 ounce lemon juice, 1/4 cup chopped onion, and 1/4 cup sweet pickle. Also took the advice of another reviewer and added a splash of pickle juice. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Marlene.

Excellent, I made no changes and this was exactly what I was looking for.  After only two hours the flavors had already come together.  Now I know I can always have great tartar sauce with very little notice.

We had salmon the other night, and while I was cooking it I realized that I was out of Tartar Sauce. Ah! So, I decided to try this one, and I'm glad I did. It turned out great. Perfect blend of flavours :)

Because of another review, I initially cut back on the onions to 1 tablespoon while making.  After tasting it, I ended up adding the entire 1/4 cup.  So recipe as written is perfect for most in my family.  (The one's that would prefer it with 1 Tbsp don't generally eat tartar sauce anyway.)  This is so much better than store bought!  YUM!
Edited to add:  I scaled the recipe back to 10 servings, using the built-in converter, so that started me out with a cup of mayo...and the rest of the measurements converted beautifully too.

I like a tartar sauce that's a little sweet and tangy. Lots of flavour to enhance, not over power the fish. This one was very bland, I don't think I'll make it again.

No lemons so used lime, also added smoked paprika and cayenne pepper [friends love spicy stuff] but just a couple of shakes, has just an undertone of hot - very good!  Will make again.

I thought this was pretty good.  This is the first time I've had tartar sauce, and it went well with our zucchini patties (which are supposed to be like crab cakes, apparently).  I think I will increase the lemon juice and decrease the dill pickles next time.  I used bottled lemon juice, as it's all I had on hand, so that may be part of the issue.  Three large pickle chips minced to the 2 Tbs needed for the recipe scaled to 5 servings.

This was a great tartar sauce!  Much better than the sweet relish ones-more like hellman's and others (that only list pickles, not relish in their ingredients).  I cut it down to 10 servings and it was perfect for 5 people!  It may have gone farther had I truly diced the pickle and onion-they ended up being a bit large for fish sticks, but it worked out.  I wouldn't change anything.

I found the dill pickles I used too salty. The lemon juice helped a little with this. I only made a small bowl of the sauce with about 3 pickles, a cup of mayo and a squeeze of lemon. Very easy recipe....much tastier than from a jar.

Really quite good! I scaled it down to 1-2 person serving size. Used 1 baby dill (minced), 2 heaping regular spoon size of mayo, a dash of lemon juice & left out the onion because I hate onion. I don't usually like dill tarter over sweet but this one is a keeper!

This really is a great tartar sauce.  How anyone could think this is terrible is beyond me.

Excellent!  Used with fish sandwiches and my husband kept telling me it was the best fish sandwich he had had.  He has continued to talk about how good it was.  Will make again since it is what made the difference.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Will never buy tarter sauce again.

We LOVED it!  So much better than stuff from a jar.  I just threw onion, pickles and a couple pickled okra (because I had them!) into the quisinart and chopped away, then stirred it into the mayo.  Simple and delicious!

Ingredients are right on, and you can just "eyeball" amounts to scale down. I added some capers. Better than any jar you can buy at the supermarket!

I have made this recipe 3 times already.  Scaled it down to 10 servings, and it is the GREATEST sauce since Captain D's.  I even take it with me when we eat seafood out because I am really choosy about tartar sauce and I love the stuff.  Thanks for sharing!

I love it I added a little more lemon juice but this is just cause I like my sauce a little more tart. I am not a fan of onion texture so I used powder instead.

This was very good and worked well in a pinch. I scaled the recipe back to 10 servings and cut back the lemon juice. I used dill pickles I had canned last summer. Very tasty.

This was perfect with our home made mahi mahi fish and chips. It was exactly what I wanted.  If you plan to scale it down use 5 or 10 servings, it divides well there.  Next time I might add a lttle dill.

I made fried walleye today for lunch and at the last minute realized we were out of tartar sauce. I ran to the computer and brought up this recipe and had it made in less than 5 minutes. I scaled the recipe down to using just one cup of mayo and also used dill relish and I added a squirt of horseradish (about 1 Tablespoon) and this is absolutely the best tartar sauce we've ever had!

Good, but it's important to drain the pickles, and the recipe doesn't mention that.  Bf whipped this up tonight bc he wanted fish sticks and we don't have tartar sauce in the house.  He used bread and butter pickles only bc that's what we have in the fridge--I much prefer dill pickles and think they'd be awesome.  We used minced dried onion bc raw onion isn't our thing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very easy to scale down.  I used tangy dill pickle relish so I didn't have to chop pickles.  I left out the onion and added a couple of twists of freshly ground pepper.  Easy to make and tastes better than anything I've ever bought.

I loved this version. It was so fast and easy. I think it was ready in 5 minutes. The fish was cooked and the plates were served and my boyfriend said "where's the tartar sauce", I ran to the computer pulled up a recipe and vuala, this was ready in 5 minutes and tasted great. Thanks a lot.

This was great and very easy.  I made a scaled down version with a couple of changes.  Instead of the chopped dill pickle I used pickle relish, and I added a pinch of cream of tarter powder.  Was enjoyed by all who ate it.

This was not bad, but you will need to play with the proportions if you downsize the recipe. Also, I tried to save time by making it all with an immersion blender; it blended the onion and pickle too far down, and the texture was too soupy. So do follow the recipe as written.

I decided at the last moment to make Fish n' Chips and I had forgotten to buy tartar sauce. It was an easy recipe (had everything on hand) and it didn't need to sit for hours to have the desired taste.  Thank you for sharing, even hubby said 'no more store bought sauce'.
