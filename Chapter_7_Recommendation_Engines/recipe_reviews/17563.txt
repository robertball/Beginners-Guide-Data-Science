I live on the west coast of FL and fish tacos are a staple.  I thought Rockaways had the best fish tacos until I made this recipe.  I AM IN LOVE!  I used grouper, 40% less sodium taco mix, used half the called for amount in the mayo/sour cream mix (otherwise too salty), sprinkled some cheddar cheese and served in flour tortillas.  Absoulutely to die for!!  Thank you!

Very good!  Instead of making fish tacos I made fish tostadas and used the sour cream topping as a spread on the tostada.  Everyone has asked for this recipe.  You can also use shrimp instead of fish.

Fabulous recipe!  Great way to eat healthy!  I used non-fat mayo and sour cream..it was great!  I also used cod that I had in the freezer.  Will make again!

Good recipe! I used catfish nuggets for the fish.  Added a can of beer to the marinade and used warmed fresh corn tortillas instead of taco shells.  Delicious.

This is an excellent healthy dish.  I used talapia and it was outstanding.  I may never go back to chicken.

This is truly fantastic!  My husband had a craving for fish tacos like the one he would get on his surfing vacations!  I did it!  He loved them!

These were very good!  We grilled halibut steaks and flaked them apart for the tacos.  By using non-fat sour cream (no mayo!) and reduced-fat tortillas and cheese it turned out to be a very low-fat and delicious meal!  We will definitely be having these again!

I love these tacos. The combination might sound a bit odd at first but is delicious. I used fat free sour cream and 1 gram fat mayo for the sauce and it came out fine. I have made these about 5 times already.. using sole, tilapia as well as red snapper.

These were delicious and easy.  I added the lime juice and also some ranch dressing and salsa to the sauce.  Along with the listed toppings, I also used crushed pineapple.  I will be making these again very soon!

Really good recipe! Easy and fast. I had to use catfish, which I never have but it was the most fresh fish at the grocery store and it still came out fantanstic. I made brown rice to make them bigger and soft white/whole wheat tortillas (my husband needs the carbs) and the sour cream and mayo sauce with fresh cilantro makes everything taste fantastic. Really good!

This is a really flavorful recipe that is healthy, too.  I changed things around a bit by adding corn and black beans to the white cabbage and green onions and sauted it for a few minutes. Put this salsa on top of your fish and sour cream/cilantro and mayo mixture and you've got one terrific taco!

I've seen fish tacos offered as a menu item in restaurants before, but was never couragous enough to order them. I tried this recipe and thought it was great. I used light sour cream and fat free mayo to make the sauce light and it was still excellent. I will definitely make this recipe again. Next time I will serve the tacos with fresh salsa to compliment the cilantro in the taco sauce.

This recipe has a lot of flavor! I've made fish tacos many times, looking for the right recipe and this is it. I think the key is the lime on the fish. I used Tilapia and let it sit for about 15 minutes in the sauce while I cut everything else up, then I cooked it. I use the Ortega Hot and Spicy seasoning which I prefer for more flavor and spice. For the sauce I used only sour cream thinned with a bit of buttermilk. Mayonnaise seemed odd and my husband doesn't care for it, anyway. Served with cabbage, tomato, lime wedges, fresh cilantro, pico de gallo, avacado, and taco seasoned cheese. Â¡Bonito!

This recipe is delicious & easy! I made this for friends and it was gone so fast! Instead of cooking it on the stove, I kept the fish whole and rubbed it with a little oil, sprinkled it with the taco seasoning & lemon juice then wrapped it in foil and put it on the BBQ.  It turned out so good that my friends wanted the recipe and my husband has requested it several times since!

My family loves these tacos. I do not use cod though, but someother white fish that is available.   I gave this recipe to a friend and instead of frying fresh fish she used fish sticks which her kids devoured.  However, I like fresh fish myself.

FABULOUS way to enjoy fish! Hubby brings home quite a lot of fish during fishing season! I'm always looking for new ways to prepare/serve it! I used low-fat sour cream and mayo and dried cilantro from my garden. I opted for shredded lettuce as well as the tomatoes and lime juce. My family tends to like soft tacos and these were delicious using flour tortillas! YUM!

Probably the best fish dish I have ever had!  My husband made it with his catch of the day (grouper and amberjack).  I told him that meals like this will get him all the passes he wants to go fishing!!

You can cut the mayo/sour cream ingredients in half unless you *really* like mayo toppings.

My kids and I do not like seafood (we made these for Dad) but these tacos were delicious and we did not stop eating until EVERYTHING was gone!  We used plain corn tortillas and fried them ourselves in a little veg. oil. So tasty and fresh--we are making them again tonight!

Wonderful, easy recipe. My wife and I loved it. One of the simplest fish-taco recipes I found on-line. 
I found it interesting that 99% of the fish-taco recipes I looked at called for cabbage, rather than lettuce.

I substituted Plain Yogurt for any of the mayo and /or sourcreme.  I don't like using either of those ingredients and the plain yogurt gave it a light and lean taste.  I also added chopped red bell peppers to the sauce - deliscious!

These really are GREAT!  But whoa, not just California is famous for its fish tacos.  One taste of the halibut tacos in Alaska and you'll think you died and went to heaven.  These are GREAT!!  But what can you expect from Ortega?  I absolutely love Ortega products and recipes!

This was really delicious!  My 2-year old wouldn't even taste it. My 12-year old son (who hates everything, especially fish) loved it!   He wants me to make it every night. I used Gorton's frozen fish fillets and it was really easy to cut them up into squares.  I mixed the lime juice into the sauce.

unfortunately the fish I used detracted from this recipe. I had frozen boneless, skinless cod pieces that I'm afraid were just not the best quality (you could tell they were not frozen when the fish was fresh).  In any case I was not overly excited about these fish tacos. I subbed a few things.  I had old el paso seasoning on hand so that is what i used.  I used corn tortillas.  I also used low fat sour cream with just a dab of mayo blended in.  we used napa cabbage, garden fresh tomatoes, onions, bananna peppers, salsa, and shredded cheese as toppings.  Overall I was not very happy with this taco.  Its not that it was bad. But the overall flavor was not appealing.  I may try these again with a better piece of fish to see if that makes a difference.  Despite the flavor issues I had, this was very easy to throw together.

Oh my gosh..... these were so good!  My husband and I were very skeptical to say the least.  However,  my dad gave us some bluegill and crappy fillets to try, so we made these.  The combination of ingredients doesn't sound very good, but together they are exceptional!!!  My sister was also nervous but she loved them.  Use fresh limes squeezed over the top... it makes a WORLD of difference.  The only changes we made were to add red onion and use dried cilantro (the store didn't have fresh).  Very good!

This was so good.  Easy, quick and delicious.  I used lime juice in place of lemon and for the fish I used Basa.

The sauce is delish!! I made this with red snapper I had on hand and substituted the sour cream for plain nonfat yogurt. The only other thing I changed was the use of corn tortillas - soft tacos. I live in L.A. so I'm familiar with real baja tacos - these tacos satisfied my craving.

I made fish tacos for my family in honor of Cinco de Mayo and I must say it was very tasty. I added shrimps to it for a true seafood taco. Muy bueno!

I made this for the first time and it was wonderful. I used reduced fat mayo and sour cream and added lots of avacado. There was not one bite left!

This was good, but a little too bland for my taste.  I should have added some cumin and cayanne papper or bought a spicy taco seasoning packet.  Also, I could only find Grouper at the grocery store and it was a bit too fishy.  I'll try to use Cod next time.

I love these tacos and friends and family love them too! The sauce is a delight in particular which can be made with fat-free or light mayonnaise and sour cream. It is good with or without the cilantro.

I have never eaten fish tacos before today.  I didn't much like the texture.  The sour cream mixture was very good.  I'll use the marinade and sour cream mixture perhaps next time with chicken instead.

This was a huge hit, we loved them. They are also very easy to make. We used soft corn tortillas instead of shells.

The flavor was good, but the recipe was too heavy & had too much oil.  Might be better if the fish was marinated then grilled, rather than pan-fried.

I impressed a house full of bachelors with this recipe!  I ran out of fish and then there was complaining because everyone wanted more!
YUMMY!
I took flour tortillas, lightly buttered them and cooked on a skillet kind of like a gordita.  Put the fish on.  Put the sauce on lightly.  Then light mexican blend cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes, diced onions and squeezed lime juice on top.
YUMMY!

I thought these were really good.  My family seems to be in a food rut, so this was a nice change.  Even my picky "meat and potatoes only" husband ate them.  Of course, I did have to ask if he would eat them again.  He said "yes". That says something.  (I did skip the cilantro, we are not big fans)

This is excellent and very easy.  I used fresh Mahi Mahi filets and a touch more of lemon juice. Served with black beans topped with fresh chopped onions and chopped yellow bell peppers.  Try some of the sour cream/mayo sauce on the beans!

I was looking for a version of fish taco's that  were not fried, and these were perfect!! I did add some lime juice and zest to the sauce, and I had to additional cayenne pepper to the sauce and fish since I like things spicier. But, overall, these were perfect! I would definitely make again!

Made these for dinner last night, and they were delicious!  We used cod, but I might use a slightly firmer white fish next time; the cod fell apart a little in the pan so it ended up more "pulled" than in pieces, but still tasted great!

I skip the taco sauce and tomatoes in this recipe and just top off the tacos with a fresh salsa.  I also only use about half of a pack of taco seasoning.  Everyone I've fixed this for loves it.

This is really good!  The dressing/sauce is great!!  The fish itself doesnt have much flavor but it's ok.  The mixture all together works well.  I've made these a few times and my DH and I gobble them up but the kids usually eat something else.  More for us!

great easy recipe!!  Depending on how fresh the fish is you are using, you may want to cut back on the seasoning and let the fish shine!  If you are using a frozen fish, the seasoning is great.

This was awesome even without the cabbage.  Used Mahi Mahi and it turned out perfectly.  As other reviewers have noted, you must use the sour cream sauce with these as that it brings that extra something to the dish.  My husband has requested that I now make these once a week.

This has all the components of a great recipe:  quick, easy, tasty.  My whole family loved it, and that is unusual for a new recipe.  I prefered the tacos in soft corn tortillas, but we had both available.  Only need to make half of the sour cream/mayo sauce, in my opinion.  I used frozen cod from Walmart, and it worked fine.  Even with less than perfect fish, these were great!

I loved these fish tacos! They tasted just like the ones you would get in a restaurant. The fish was a little bit of a pain to fry. But the idea of adding the taco seasoning to sour cream was very yummy!

These were okay but not great.  My family and I just didn't think these tacos tasted that well, especially considering all of the reviews.  Fish really doesn't go that well with taco shells.  I won't be making this again.

WOW!  These were so good!  I used non fat plain yogurt in place of sour cream and non fat mayonnaise, I will continue to make it like that because the seasoning totally kicks up the flavor-the extra fat is not needed.  We will keep this in our recipe box!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very yummy.  My husband and I decided that we will make this for now on instead of beef tacos.  Light and fat free mayo and sour cream work really well.  We also put fresh sliced alvacado in it, and used soft shells.  We are not big cilantro people.  I omitted it and it was not missed.

Pretty darn good.  I used tilapia for the fish, which worked out great.  Also made my own tortillas, which always improves things.  I don't know how you could possibly stretch this to fill 12 tortillas, though!

Very delicious, I used walleye pike in place of cod and it worked well.  Also, I forgot 
to buy lime juice and omitted the cilantro and the tacos were still fabulous.  
This recipe took a little more preparation time than I thought it would, especially 
to skin the fish, but it was worth it.

Awesome recipe, so simple too!  my kids loved it (2 & 4).  We loved the fresh taste and all the flavor.  I did change a few things.  We used leftover rainbow trout we had baked and add some garlic and onion to the sauce with just a dash of cayenne for some spice.  We also used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage because that was what we had.  But overall a great flavor!

5 stars for this recipe, if you substitute the generic seasoning for something better.  Let me recommend both Cajun seasoning as well as Creole seasoning.  Waaaay better than taco seasoning for this recipe.

This recipe didn't taste at all like true "baja" fish tacos; just regular beef tacos without the red meat. I lost the recipe that I usually use and I hope that I find a good replacement soon.

These tacos are delicious! I'd been craving fish tacos (but never had one) so I tried this recipe and LOVED IT. The only thing I did was dust the fish with the taco seasoning and flour before I fried it up, and used tilapia instead. This was even good the next day for lunch.

Just made this and it exceeded my expectations. Have been searching for a great fish taco recipe and need not look further! Modifications included homemade salsa instead of tomatoes or taco sauce, and I didn't have taco seasoning so I made it with my spices following another allrecipes recipe. I love to cook but I seek variety from meal to meal so it's rare when I say I can't wait to make a recipe again, but given the ease of difficulty, price and flavor, it's well worth making again and again! Definite keeper.

My whole family loves these so much that we have them at least 2 or 3 times a month.  We don't care for the sauce, so we just top our tacos with lettuce, cheese and tomato.  These are so much better and healthier than the traditional beef taco.  Even my 6 year old daughter told me to make these from now on instead of the beef ones.  These are wonderful!!!

Very good. We had them with lettuce because I didn't have cabbage on hand. Also I used a bit less cilantro than called for. The only thing I would add is that the fish tends to stick to the pan when cooked this way. Next time I will coat it first or grill it or something first.

Good, but not great.  A nice change from regular tacos.  Fish was interesting but think I'll try chicken the next time.  My picky 10 yr. old loved them though.  Very spicy.

My husband, who generally doesn't like cod because of its "fishy" taste, didn't really care for this recipe. I liked the flavor, though. We might try this again with chicken instead. With the spicyness of the taco seasoning, you don't even really need the salsa.

I made this recipe for the first time while visiting family in Moreno Valley, California, and they all loved it!  It was quick and easy to make - I used corn and flour tortillas in place of taco shells. I know I'll be making Baja Fish Tacos a lot from now on!

Outstanding recipe and has become a staple in our household. They light and refreshing and I love the dressing as well - We use soft tacos or small tortilla's when having these - great with Cod and Talapia !!

This is a quick delicious recipe. I had to subtitute canola oil for vegetable oil, and I didn't have cilantro, but this was still a Yummy-To-My-Tummy meal that even my 2 and 3.5 yr old girs loved. I made this meal two weeks in a row... I just had to fulfill the craving.

The sauce is simply awesome. I used Swai fillets and garnished with finely shredded cabbage. I used soft corn tortilla instead of Taco Shells. A great recipe, simple and fast.

They were ok, but I like it better when the fish is breaded for tacos, so it was lacking in the "crunchiness". Maybe I'll try it again with breading the fish before I grill it. The cream sauce was great, I added more cilantro since it was a little bland. But with added lime, the entire taste factor was pretty good. But, I've had better. sorry.

We actually used some leftover grilled halibut and loved the results.  Better than any we've ever eaten out!

These were really good. I made a few healthy changes.   I used a Simply Organic brand fish taco seasoning mix.  I used plain yogurt in the place of the mayo and sour cream in the sauce.  I used olive for frying the fish.  And I used whole grain corn tortillas from Whole Foods instead of taco shells.  I served with cabbage, guacamole, pico de gallo and black beans.  My whole family loved them, and they were very healthy!

This was okay but I think I'll pay a few bucks more and go to a restaurant for really GOOD fish tacos.

Delicious, especially the sauce.  Be careful that you have good ventilation in your kitchen.  After I made them, my friend and I got into a cab and the cabbie started waving his hand in front of his nose frantically yelling "TOO MUCH LIKE FISH...IT SMELLS TOO MUCH LIKE FISH."  
A little embarassing.
