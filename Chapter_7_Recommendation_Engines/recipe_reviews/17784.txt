My husband and I loved the recipe.  We marinated it for 1 hour and also put 1/2 as much teriyaki sauce and it was delicious.  We left 2 pieces of chicken the full 24 hours and it wasn't as tasty as the day before.  I hope this helps!  All in all it was really tasty.

I was hungry for chicken teriyaki so I only marinated it for about 5 hours.  I didn't have sesame seed oil, so I left that out.  Anyway, the chicken tasted great; the flavor went all through it.  It was very moist and tender, too. I used about 3/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and everything else in the same proportions, although I had plenty of marinade for 6 chicken breast halves instead of four.

I used about 3/4 cup of teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds already in it, 2 tsp. lime juice, a hearty squeeze of honey from the bottle, 2 tbs. minced garlic, and a small can of pineapple chunks(including the juice).  These were the things I had on hand (no sesame oil).    I marinaded chicken tenderloin strips in this for about 2 hours.  I sprayed the grill with olive oil then put the chicken and pineapple chunks on skewers and grilled them.  The whole family enjoyed this yummy "chicken on a stick."

Even marinated for one hour, this recipe was excellent. I added some sweet thai chili sauce for a little spicy kick. I saved the marinade and stir fried it with some cooked spaghetti noodles and made a bed of the noodles for the chicken to lay on. This is definately a family favorite.

Very easy to prepare and so so results. I found the Teriyaki taste to be too strong.  I only used 1/2 Cup of the Teriyaki so I can't imagine what the full amount would be!!

This was wonderful.  I used chicken leg quarters and grilled them and they were wonderful. If you don't use breasts, marinate them a little longer.  I will use this recipe from now on.

This is delicious!  I was a bit concerned about it being too salty after I read the previous reviews, so I added a couple of teaspoons of white wine vinegar to the marinade and it was fine (not too salty).

Wow, this recipe was really easy and tasted great. I slow cooked the chicken on the grill and it really kept all of it's flavor.

We all really loved this!  I had forgotten about the overnight marinade so I only marinaded for 10 hours, still came out great!  We had the chicken as sandwiches with lettuce and tomato and I basted the chiccken all throughout the cooking process.  Will make again!

This is an easy to make dish & it tastes wonderful. I didn't need to make any changes. My family loves it and I can't wait to serve it to guests. It went well with fried rice.

This was an awesome recipe!  I followed the ingredients but made 3/4 of the recipe and had plenty of sauce.  I saved about 1/4 cup and basted the chicken as it was cooking on the BBQ.  We loved the flavor, I haven't ever used sesame oil and I couldn't believe how much it changed the flavor (for the better!)  This was probably the best chicken that I have ever made on the grill, it was so moist too!  Thanks for the great recipe!

GREAT marinade! We really liked it and will make it again. I agree to reduce the teriyaki sauce to 2/3 cup. I used 3/4 c. and it was just slightly too salty still. I added 2 diced green onions/scallions to the marinade and a dash of ginger as suggested by others. This was probably one of the best marinades we have ever had. Only had time to marinade the meat about 2 hours but still perfect.
P.S. I had originally rated this recipe a 4 stars, but my husband asked me to reconsider since he loved it so much. After preparing and eating this again with the same excellent results, I had to agree with him!

This was yummy and incredibly easy. Using other reviewers' suggestions, I added half a can of pineapple chunks (with the juice) and added a big squirt of honey. I used chicken breast cutlets on the George Foreman grill. I forgot to marinate it overnight but put it in the fridge for about 12 hours. The teriyaki sauce I had on hand had garlic in it so I didn't add more. I also didn't have sesame oil on hand and just went without it. I served it with white rice and if I had had more time, I would've added steamed broccoli.

This chicken is amazing! Use Organicville's Sesame Teriyaki Sauce, can be found at Costco. So much better than other brands we have tried. My husband cooks this chicken in his smoker.

I'm sure if you get actual teriyaki sauce (thick, made to put over prepared chicken) then this would really be easy and delicious. If you purchased the more runny, saltier teriyaki marinade by accident, here's what I did: In a sauce pan, add the marinade, water, sugar (lots of it), honey, the sesame oil, lemon juice and garlic.  Mix it and when it comes to a boil and reduces, taste it.  if it still isn't sweet enough, add sugar to taste.  I added peanut butter for a Thai twist and it came out pretty tasty!

Perfect, but only marinate for a few hours -- 24 hours is too long.

This was so easy to make! Since it's the dead of winter, I used my George Foreman grill.  That worked great! Flavor was good and very tasty! I will make this again.

If I make this again I will use white wine instead of lemon juice plus add a little molasses and brown sugar.  I just think a touch of sweet would make this recipe come alive.

This chicken was soo tender! I did end up added ginger and onion powder also used canola oil. I agree this was a little bit salty but I never like chicken breast on the grill and this was great.

I saved 1/4 of the marinade to pour on chicken at table.
I marinated chicken for 2 hours.  That was enough time for the flavors to penetrate the chicken.

Only marinaded for a couple of hours and made kabobs out of them.  I didn't have problem with saltiness and they were excellent.  The kids, DH and I loved them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I like this recipe even better substituting 1/4 cup peanut butter for the sesame oil and lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Reserve some of the sauce before marinating so you can dip the cooked chicken.  Delicious!

This was fantastic and so easy to make!  We used boneless breasts, boneless thighs and shrimp.  Cut chicken in bite size pieces, put on skewers and cooked on grill.  Only marinated for a few hours and it was great.  According to my 15 year old son, it was "mad fresh"!!!!!

This was wonderful. I only marinated it about 3-4 hrs and it was very tasty. I cooked it on the george foreman grill because it was too cold to grill outside. It did get a little too "blackened" and I thought it would taste bad but I was wrong... it was great! Thanks for the recipe I will be making this often.

I made this chicken 3 times and it's incredible.  It comes out best if you marinate it for 24 hours.

I followed recipe with the below changes: Used Legs & Split Breast w/bones-cut it right down the breast bone making each big breast into 2-trimmed any hanging fat w/scissors of chicken pieces. Made double batch-used extra garlic-cut fresh & chunky.I keep fresh peeled garlic in my freezer and use it as needed.I added some honey-maybe a 1/4 cup per batch to teriyaki and fresh lemon juice per recipe. - put in big gallon zip lock and tossed chicken. Marinated overnight. Cooked chicken with generous amount of sauce from marination in a 350 degree oven in large cast iron pan, covered, about an hour. Wood burning Big Green Egg grill outdoors  was heated up. Put chicken on grill and grilled both sides for flavor & look. Mopped it a bit with the teriyaki out of the cast pan. We closed the cooker at times to give it the  smoky flavor. I sliced a whole pineapple into rings- coated in seaseme oil. As we removed chicken, I put on the rings and gave them a grilled look and flavor. While chicken was on grill, I added some powdered arrow root to slightly thicken the teriyaki sauce in the cast pan. Corn starch would be fine too- just a very small amount. After it looked grilled, I put it all back in the cast iron pan and basted with the sauce from the pan. I brought back in the house. On the stove, I cooked some brown sugar, butter and used some of the teriyaki sauce still left in the bag from the marination. As this had raw poultry in it, it is important to let it come to a bubbly boil.

I loved this "T's mom"! I was cleaning out my freezer and found one lonely chicken breast. I decided to make this for my lunch today and it was so good. Didn't add or change a darn thing except that I wish I had more for lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much!!

Wow...This recipe proves that all marinades are not created equal. I marinated for 24 hours and basted honey on while grilling. These were so flavorful and tender. One thing I might try is a lower sodium teriyaki sauce as they were slightly salty.

I expected this recipe to be really good judging from the reviews, but my husband and I were very disappointed.  There is no other way to say it -- the flavor was terrible.  We couldn't eat more than a few bites without having to heat up leftovers.

(My "quickness" rating takes into
account the 24hrs of marinating; of 
course, it cooks very quickly.)
I think the lemon juice nicely 
counteracts what I consider the too 
sweet nature of most teriyaki sauces. I
admit to using just a tad more garlic,
but that is s.o.p. in my house. I think
the flavors blend so well that they
belie the simplicity of the marinade.
Served over a bed of brown rice (cooked
in chicken broth) and accompanied by a
romaine/watercress salad dressed with a
simple vinaigrette, this makes a 
delightful summer supper.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe for 6 large chicken breasts, and only had time to marinate for 1 hour.  Based on "LOVESTOEAT" comments, I used only 1.5 c. teriyaki (low sodium) vs. 2 cups, and all the other ingredients as written.  I hand squeezed lemons for the lemon juice and used minced garlic from a jar.  Used toasted sesame oil, which adds a lot of flavor!

I got lots of compliments from my guests, and I thought it was delicious!

This chicken recipe turned out great!  They were incredibly juicy.  I would cut down on the lemon juice--it seemed to overtake the teriyaki flavor.

Very good Recipe went over great at the house after only 10 hours in the fridge. Leftovers sat for 2 days only to be brought to a big BBQ, which people enjoyed there. There is a lot of flavor and I didn't really need to bast any of the marinade on.

I made this a few days ago and couldn't believe how delicious this was. It was a pain to have to marinate the chicken for 24 hours but so worth it. This will definately become one of my staple recipes for chicken! My neighbor loved it too!!

I'm not a big teriyaki fan and this dish was awesome.  I also used 3/4 cups of teriyaki because that is all I had - worked perfectly.  Put the chicken over quinoa and literally dipped my forkful's into the sauce - it was that good.

This is so good.  I used 4 oz chicken breasts and they cooked up really well on the grill.  I wish I had made more of the sauce for the rice I served it with though.  I may have to make a side of it next time.

One of the better chicken teriyaki recipes that I've found, and so easy to prepare! The long marinade really helps but I've found over the several times I've made it, marinading for a few hours is just fine.

I think this would have been awesome but I made a crucial error which I hope to remedy next time.  I marinated drumsticks overnight but I didn't have a plastic bag big enough so I stuck them in a pan.  This really didn't allow them to properly marinate so even though they were SUPER tender off the grill, they weren't as flavorful as I had hoped.  However, to the person who suggested stir-frying the leftover marinade with noodles was genius!  The noodles were so delicious!  I will definitely make this again because of how good the noodles were, but I will try boneless breasts and use a plastic bag!!

This is a very good, classic teryaki chicken recipe and is now one of our favorites!

Too salty!  Not sure if it's because I marinated for too long (7 hours) or the teriyaki sauce I used (Kikkoman). Wouldn't try again.

We really enjoyed this recipe, although we didn't have the full 24 hour time marinating.  We had closer to 1 hour, but we did cut the pieces prior to marinating, put them on skewers, and grilled them.  We didn't have the sesame oil, but did add some pineapple juice (since we were grilling the pineapple too!) The hubby and kids (4 and 6) all loved this and we didn't even have any left overs!

I have made this recipe twice using my counter top rotisserie. Once with a small whole chicken on the spit and once with pieces using the rotisserie container.Marinated overnight. I saved a little marinade to baste as they cooked. It was wonderful each time. So if you happen to live where grills are not allowed you can still have great "grilled" foods like this.

Use boneless skinless chicken thighs!  Chicken breasts will be too dry.  Use straight soy sauce, instead of the teriyaki "sauce", which is way too salty.  You usually find these "Chicken on a Stick" at fairs and festivals and always sell out.

Love it!  I bake the chicken for 20 minutes and then grill it for 5-10 and then put it over white rice.  It's amazing.

The chicken turned out pretty well, though slightly dry.  I marinated it for almost 24 hours.  I forgot to pierce the chicken before putting it in the marinade...I think that would have helped.

I pounded the chicken breasts just a little bit and marinated for 24 hours and the results were fantastic.  Silky chicken, very tender and it got rave results at the BBQ I made it for.

Chicken is a family favorite in our home. The lemon juice & grated garlic added some zesty flavor to this recipe and made our meal ever so appetizing. A great idea to lightly oil the grate.

This has an excellent flavor-none of the ingredients are too strong. I actually ran out 
of sesame oil, so I just used Becel oil-it was still fantastic! This marinade would be 
really good on salmon,too.Josie

Great recipe!! The lower rating for quickness reflects the 
time required to marinate. Cooking is fast! This chicken has
a superb flavor due to the sesame oil. My husband even liked 
it and I am certain my kids will too when they are home next
time. Thanks for the great recipes!

It seems that we only use the grill for steak & burgers, and for chicken & pork, I use the oven or stove top methods.  So, after reading how simple this recipe was, I bravely moved out of my comfort zone.  I used 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 3/4 cup of teriyaki, 1/8 of a cup of lemon juice (fearful it would taste too lemony if I used more)and marinated the chicken for 7 hours.  The chicken turned out delicious!!  Almost like we knew what we were doing!  Seved it with scalloped potatoes and cauliflower/olive salad.  A terrific change up for us that will definitely be repeated in the future.

Delicious!  Was only able to marinate for an hour since I found this recipe last minute, but that was plenty of time (and we prefer lots of flavor).  Based on other reviews, I reduced my teriyaki sauce to 2/3 cup. Next time I will use a thicker teriyaki that I've had in the past instead of the runny kind I used tonight.  It was definitely salty but still very good.  I saved a half cup of the marinade to baste with (only used two chicken breasts), then boiled the leftover marinade so we could use it for sauce. To this sauce I added about a half cup of chicken broth to decrease the saltiness, and some brown sugar for sweetness.  Cornstarch thickened it up and we enjoyed it immensely.  Will make again, probably with some pineapple as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks, Prissycat!

Marinated for 48 hours.  Grilled bone-in thighs, skin side up, for 55 min over indirect coals but did not turn.  Skin was crisp like it had been fried.  Boiled the marinade and brushed on after 30 min and then at the table.  Was not salty at all.  My guests went crazy over the flavor!

This was a fantastic recipe that was easy and tasted phenomenal. It tasted a lot like the food that I had while in Japan a couple of weeks ago! Though, I did alter it a little. Instead of grilling it - because it was raining - I stir fried it. I also used lime juice instead of lemon, because I didn't have any! Over all nice and easy recipe that tastes outstanding!

I love the fact that this marinade only has 4 ingredients so it is easy. Because of a last minute invite to go out to dinner I actually ended up marinating for 3-4 days.  I threw in 8 breasts instead of 4 and marinated in a ziploc bag that I rotated every day.  We ate them on buns as chicken sandwiches and my husband and sons absolutely raved about them.

This recipe was way too salty, the chicken tasted like teriyaki beef jerkey. I will not make this again, and I would recommend anyone who gives it a try to use half the sesame oil and marinate for only a few hours.

Made this last night, but instead of chicken breasts I used chicken tenders and found the teriyaki to be very overpowering!  Maybe marinate for less time and use less teriyaki next time.

This took way longer to cook than the recipe called for.  I also thought that there wasn't that much flavor once the chicken was grilled.

This was good and very simple to make.  I only marinated for about 12 hours but it was still very flavorful.  I felt it had a bit too strong of a garlic flavor, but that could have just been those particular cloves.  When I make it again if it's still strong I will cut back a tad.  I think next time I might cut the chicken up and put it on skewers with pineapple and veggies.

Very easy and tastes okay. If your are looking for a sweeter taste (I like a sweeter teriyaki sauce/taste) find a different recipe this is a little on the salty side.

This recipe was so easy to make and I ended up marinating the chicken for 2 days because things came up and I was too busy to cook so of course it was even MORE tender when finished!  We all loved this recipe - thanks!

This was the best grilled chicken I have ever made.  It was tender and moist with a lot of flavor.  This will be my standard grilled chicken recipe.

I have found that some marinades can be left too long - soy or teriyaki especially.  I have learned to only marinate a few hours or less - not all night, and never 24 hours.  Gets so overwhelming.

I made this a little while ago, but I haven't written a review until now. We love it when we tried it the first time. I've been trying different variations of it since. I think I omitted the sesame oil because I didn't have any one hand, and it was still a great flavor. I've tried adding more or less garlic or lemon juice, and all the variations have been great. It's so simple too. I love it.

This was VERY good, especially given the few ingredients and minimal prep time. The chicken was very flavorful, and I boiled the marinade and served it over rice and it was SOOOO good!  Will definitely keep this recipe.

My sweetie, a somewhat picky eater, loved this recipe.  I was a little concerned because Walmart didn't have low-sodium teriyaki sauce, and I didn't feel like making multiple stops.  I used Kikkoman and I don't know if there's a big difference in brands, but it was not to salty for him.  He loved how tender the chicken was and now I'll probably have to use marinades more often because he loved how the flavor was all the way through as opposed to just the outside (or skin for those who eat that).  I don't mind because it's so simple, can't believe I never did it before.  Instead of a grill I put it in the oven in a roasting pan w/a rack in it. Outstanding according to him....I'm a vegetarian so I don't know, but it did smell good.

We loved this easy recipe!  I made a couple changes, I used a honey teriyaki sauce, and didn't use sesame oil (I need to buy some for next time).  Next time I'll add a bit more garlic.  This has such a great taste, and is definitely easy for a weeknight dinner.  This is a keeper!  Thanks T's Mom for sharing!

I only got to marinate it for twenty minutes and it was DELICIOUS!  I have six kids and I believe that food should be a pleasurable experience.  If people don't make the "mmmmm" sound with the first bite, I am not satisfied!  I mildly pounded the breasts and used a Teriyaki from Costco (very nice) and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I was amazed at the difference the lemon juice made so do not skimp out on that one!  Chicken was moist and flavours had marinated through surprisingly well.  I poured remaining juices over the chicken when I first placed it on my BBQ (why would anyone throw out extra flavour??).  I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again with a full-time marinating period!

I planned on making this on a specific night, but when I went to make it I realized it was suppose to be marinated for 24 hours.  I only marinated it 30 minutes and it was amazing.  I will definitely make it again and marinate it longer.

Pretty good, only marinated for about 4 hours...and added a couple squirts of honey & green onions. Grilled pineapple & served with Jasmine rice.  Will make some tweaks next time, but overall a good start!

Nice.  Marinated for several hours but not overnight.  Cooked in a grill pan on the stove top.  Was good.  Put leftovers on buns for sandwiches the next day.  Thanks.

I made this with boneless chicken breast and drumsticks, and I thought the drumsticks were much juicier.

Very Easy recipe.  It really made the chicken moist and tasty.  I used an Anthony Warhill grill and it only took 7 minutes to make it perfect.  My hubsand loved it and will definitely make it again.

I marinated the chicken for approximately 5 hours and cooked them on the grill.  They were amazing and had great flavor.  I cooked extra so I could have leftovers and when I came home from work the next day my sons had devoured what was left.

This was delicious. It did produce a lot of sauce, so in the future, I will do as other readers did and double the meat. The flavor was amazing, we also brushed some fresh pineapple with the sauce and grilled it. A side of white rice made the meal complete. Great recipe and definitely a keeper!

Verrrry good!  Made this for dinner tonight with home-grown green beans!  I did slightly alter the recipe, however, by reducing the lemon juice to 1/8 cup, added 1/4 tsp black pepper, and omitted the oil.  I used Soy Vey 'Veri Veri Teriyaki" sauce, and I doubled the quantity of chicken but kept the amount of marinade the same -- there was plenty to cover 8 pieces of chicken.  Hubby liked it very much!

I hesitated to make this, because I didn't have 24 hours to marinade.  Here's what I did:  After about 45 minutes of actual marinading, it was time to put the chicken on the grill.  The whole time the chicken was cooking, I continued to periodically dip the breasts back into the marinade.  This turned into a nice glaze, and the chicken was delicious.  You do need to be careful to thoroughly heat both sides at the end without adding more marinade, since the marinade of course was exposed to the raw chicken.

It was great and so easy. I used the juice from a can of mandarin oranges instead of the lime juice, because I forgot that I was out of lime juice. And it was a nice combination of flavors. I also poked the chicken full of holes with a fork to help the marinade get all through the chicken and to tenderize it!

I use sauce from "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" from this site, and grill according to this recipe. Grilling captures the flavor so much better. Easy preparation, quick, and tasty. Grade: A.

I usually buy the Lawrey's marinade, but thought I would try this since I had the ingredients at home.  Pounded the chicken out like for sandwiches and marinaded for 6 hours.  Was wonderful...  Rave reviews from the fam.  Thanks!!!

This was quick and easy and had good flavor for the few ingredients involved.  Since they are so few and one of them is a bottled sauce, I'm sure the outcome will depend entirely on the quality of the sauce, so use one you know is tasty.  Chicken stayed fairly moist and had a pretty good flavor, but if your chicken is on the thicker side, I would recommend butterflying it or something because we didn't have a whole lot of flavor throughout.

This grilled chicken lives up to its title as easy.  I just tossed everything in a bag and let it sit in the fridge.  I didn't let it marinate for 24 hours but 6 hours seemed to give it enough flavor. I'll try it overnight next time...(i just usually forget to prepare things that far ahead of time.) Anyway...very tasty recipe! The chicken stayed pretty juicy for being grilled.  I had some leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better. Will definitely make this again!

We didnt have much time left so we only marinated for about 15 mins, nevertheless, his was VERY tasty!! The chicken was soo tender and juicy. Loved it!!! Will be making this again only next time making sure we have more time to marinate so it can soak into the chicken instead of just on the outside! :)

This recipe was very easy to make and everybody raved about it. 
I used less teriyaki as some other suggested and it was enough for me. I recommend using organic chicken in stead of regulare, because the taste is so much better. 
This is great to make for company, make sure you have chickenbreast of the same size.

Great recipe! I followed advice of other reviewers and marinated only 2 hours, but I'll increase to at least 4 hours next time. I used an indoor grill and it worked well, just had to increase grill time.

I ended up coming in a pan with all the remaining sauce.  I want hungry so I didn't eat but everyone said they really liked it.  It'd been a lot better on the grill and served with rice.

Prepared this for dinner last night.  Only had time to marinate for 
2 1/2- 3 hours and it was still OUTSANDING. Everyone really enjoyed it.  Made exactly per directions-very simple and quick. I did set some of the marinade aside before putting it on chicken to 'soak'--then basted with chicken with the 'un-used' sauce during the last minutes of grilling.   Thanks for a great recipe.

It was really salty but I did marinate a long time.  I didn't mind but my family all complained.  I probably will try it again just decrease the marinating time.

I just used half of the teriyaki sauce and marinated it for about two hours.. It was amazing! I served it with easy green beans marinated in soy sauce, ginger, and toasted sesame seeds. Plain white rice on the side courtesy of my rice cooker. So simple and healthy, I will definitely be making this whenever I need an absolutely delicious, easy meal.

We made these when we had company during the summer, and got lots of compliments, and people asking for the recipe.  They were nice and juicy, which is hard to do on the grill.

Everyone LOVED these. I remembered to marinate them overnight so they really soaked in the flavor. I grilled them on my George Foreman grill and then made them into some great sandwhiches, with toasted buns! YUMMY....we will use this again. Thanks!!

This is a very easy way to make chicken not so boring. The first time I made it I didn't have 24-hours to marinate, only about 3, and it still turned out great. I did pound my chicken breast down a little bit to make them a little thinner and all the same thickness. This couldn't be any easier to make.

Awesome!! We loved this chicken. I made it exactly as instructed. My husband was so impressed he said I could BBQ for him anytime. He made a chicken sandwich on a french roll the next day with one of the leftover breasts and commented once again on how good it was. Thank you so much!

I usually only leave a review when I find a recipe exceptional... this is one of them!  My niece, a 'semi'-vegan, had some of this chicken and said it "was the best meat she ever ate".  I used Teriyaki Marinade sauce instead of regular teriyaki the first time(as I always have the marinade on hand) and it was just as good or better.  The marinading 24 hrs. makes it melt in your mouth, however I've been impatient and barbi'ed it after 4 hrs and was still excellent... maybe not quite as tender but the taste makes up for it.  
EXCELLENT RECIPE!!

Terrific recipe for a multi-purpose marinade.  Tried this with grilled chicken breasts that I pounded flat a little bit.  They remained moist and tender and fantastically flavorful.  A new favorite.

YUM!  I didn't have lemon juice, so I used orange.  Also, used about 3/4 cup of teriyaki, instead of 1 cup.  Only took an hour and a half of marinating for juicy, flavorful results!!

I used about 3/4 cup of low sodium teriyaki sauce. I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours. The chicken was moist and very tender. Definately a 'keeper'.

Excellent!  Used a cut up fryer and lime juice instead of lemon because that was what I had.  Marinated it for about 5 hours then grill on a gas grill.  Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I always forget to marinate overnight, I have even done it a few hours before I was going to cook and it came out great. Of course the chicken is not as dry if you marinate overnight, but still good and the best part is it's easy!

This was very easy and quite good.  However, very salty, even after I cut down on the teriyaki sauce.  Next time, I'll cut back to a half cup or less.

Excellent taste and so easy! The sesame oil is what "makes it".  I did use low sodium teriyaki sauce and only grilled 4 min. per side (over very high heat).

This was okay. I left out the oil, and followed the recipe otherwise. The chicken came out juicy. It wasn't spectacular, but good and easy for a weeknight meal.

Made it...like my own better.  Should I tell?? or get heck cuz I give my recipe?  Personally, I love to read the tweaks that people come up with.  You can follow or not.  
I make my marinade with ginger, garlic ,oil , wine, soy sauce,and some teriyaki sauce.  Needs 2 T brown sugar or the equivalent.  Marinate chicken for an hour and steak for as much as 12 hrs nd you will have a restaurant quality teriyaki with beef, pork, or poultry.

Made it...like my own better.  Should I tell?? or get heck cuz I give my recipe?  Personally, I love to read the tweaks that people come up with.  You can follow or not.  
I make my marinade with ginger, garlic ,oil , wine, soy sauce,and some teriyaki sauce.  Needs 2 T brown sugar or the equivalent.  Marinate chicken for an hour and steak for as much as 12 hrs nd you will have a restaurant quality teriyaki with beef, pork, or poultry.

My husband was impressed with this chicken, especially because he normally does the grilling.  It was very tasty.  Thank you.

The sauce is very simple and delicious.I tenderized the chicken and cooked it in vegetable oil on a frying pan. 4 teaspoons of oil, start high heat to blacken the chicken, three minutes on each side, lower heat to medium and cook another 3-5mins while flipping several more times.

This was a fantastic recipe--easy to make, simple, and delicious.  I bought a package of Tri tip steaks (2 1/4 lbs) and adjusted the ingredients to that amount, however doubling the crushed garlic.  I marinated the steaks overnight and grilled them the following evening (to about 138 degrees on the instant read thermometer).  They were so tender and had a wonderful flavor.  With a little bit left over the next evening, sauteed some mushrooms and sliced the leftovers thin to put over toasted rosemary bread with melted cheddar cheese on top.  So glad I bought two packages of steaks--will definitely be making them again!

This was just really good. I didn't marinate for longer than 5 hours and it was just fine. I used chicken breasts and boneless chicken thighs. Very moist and tender.

Made no adjustments to the sauce itself. Chicken didn't seem to have much of a teriyaki flavour imparted, but then again I forgot to add the oil, if that has any effect on flavour absorption. However, the chicken remained absolutely tender and succulent on the inside, and was still delicious.

Instead of discarding the marinade, I mixed it with a bit of sugar and reduced it in a pot to make a glaze. Once I'd grilled the chicken on both sides, I quickly hoyed it in the oven, and drizzled the glaze over it for a few minutes. Had no impact on the moistness of the chicken, and added a nice sweet and savoury layer of teriyaki

Very simple to make. The right teriyaki sauce is a must every time. I didn't have sesame oil or anything close so I used a spoonful of natural peanut butter. Marinated for six hours and pulled off the grill while still juicy. Pecan chips for a little smoke flavor made this my daughters favorite.

I did as many suggested - added scallions and honey to the lemon, sesame oil , garlic and teriyaki.  I marinated my chicken legs for about 18 hours.....um um good.  Loved the grilled flavor of the marinade.  So easy and so flavorful.

This was my first meal with chicken that I have ever made in my entire life, and i was shocked at how ok it tasted, (because i expected it to taste terrible) i did think that either the sesame oil or garlic was a little too strong for me. I usually like my chicken teriyaki sweet so I purchased Panda Express mandarin sauce for teriyaki and it was amazing, (I marinated almost 24hr).  My other mistake was not cutting the chicken breast in half, it turned out way too thick and chewy for my liking but overall it was a decent meal.

I made this exactly according to recipe. I marinated chicken strips and grilled on a skewer. PERFECT! Even my non-chicken eating husband loved it. I wouldn't change a thing, and will be making this often.

I  used half the amount of marinade called for, and six  breasts instead of four. I pounded the breasts to equal thickness prior to marinating.  Half an hour in the marinade before grilling seemed enough to me.  We grilled eight minutes on each side over medium heat and let the meat rest for a couple of minutes before cutting. It was tasty and succulent and a hit with all three generations!

Yes ! A great way to do the chicken and a departure from the Japanese Teriyaki crossing over to a Korean and American BBQ.
The sesame oil and garlic is standard in the Korean BBQ for almost everything they grill and the lemon is a fantastic tangy brightener in an American diner kind of spritz. May I suggest that the garlic be doubled or tripled ( when cooked it does not have the same burn or intensity) and that the chicken be cooked longer over low heat or medium indirect if possible. Also stacking the chicken in a pyramid is a way to have a self basting architecture ( something my father always did with BBQ chicken).
If handy, chopped green onions and or cilantro look and taste great over the final platter of the yard strutter for din din!! In the words of Chef John " Enjoy !"  Chris jazz cook Ho

Only deviated from the directions by using a bit more teriyaki sauce than it called for (I just dumped the whole 10 oz. bottle in the bag). It was outstanding. Absolutely full of flavor and incredibly tasty!

My changes: I didn't have lemon juice so I used a bit of lemon jam/spread.  I also added some Red Rooster chili sauce like some of the reviewers recommended and reduced the teriyaki sauce to half.  Tasted delicious though and was very easy.  I doubled the sauce and used half for stirfrying vegetables.

Muy rica, muy sencilla. Recomiendo prepararla en la noche y dejar el pollo marinar en bolsa de plástico o en una bandeja de cristal y cubrirla con plástico. Lo preparas a la hora de la comida y la acompañas con arroz y unas verduras al vapor y toda la familia queda plenamente satisfecha.

Excellent recipe. I omitted the sesame oil, only because I didn't have any on hand, and the chicken won rave reviews from my family. This is a five star plus!

I made a ton of this and let it marinade for 2 days. It was delicious. My husband and I ate everything I made. I was hoping for leftovers, but I couldn't stop eating!

My family and I absolutely love this recipe!  We could not wait to have it so I did not marinate the chicken for a day.  We had it for the first time tonight, I prepared it and put it straight onto the grill.  The taste was absolutely delicious.  I'll try to resist not marinating next time.  We served it with steamed asparagus and salad.  This is one of our new favorites.  Thank you for sharing and adding a new wonderful recipe to our household!

Super.  I did pound the chicken breasts out to allow more surface for the marinade to permeate.  Served with Japanese vegetables from this site.  Great meal.

Tried this on the 4th of July for family and friends, and it was Awesome.   We just loved it.  I found it not too salty at all.....and did marinate it for the full 24 hours.   I used chicken tenderloins.  This will be a major staple at my house from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night on the foreman grill; I added some honey & lime juice, as per some of the other reviews.  Let it marinate for about 3 hours.  It was so-so, tasted too "citrusy" for me and I couldn't tell I'd used any honey; no comments from the peanut gallery (my family), so I decided this is not a keeper.  I refrigerated the leftovers and decided to finish it off today for lunch, or it would have eventually been thrown out.  Let me say:  WOW!!!!  What a difference it made to let it sit in the fridge for a day!  It was DELISH!!!!!  Moist, juicy, the limey taste was gone, it was FABULOUS.  This is most definitely a keeper!  For my taste, I'll experiment using a little more honey and less lime, and perhaps using the charcoal would help too.

This was very good, had a light but yummy flavor. I baked it in the oven. Be sure to cook on foil, because the sauce really bakes itself onto the glass pan.

Good marinade for the chicken. I buy low sodium everything when I can, so I didn't think that these were too salty like previous reviewers. Thanks.

I found this to be way too salty, but it could have just been the brand of teriyaki sauce I used.  If it had not been for that, it would have been really tasty.

This was tasty, but I had to bake this ( I have no grill) I am sure it would taste better on the grill. I prefered this more cold in a salad than hot.

This was great and I only had time to marinate for a couple of hours.

This is soooo easy and good!  I never have time to let it marinate over night.  I also never use the oil.  It absorbs the flavor really well and cooks well on the Foreman grill.  I serve it with an easy fried rice recipe, and it's great!!!

This was pretty good. Not the strong flavor that I like in teriyaki chicken though.
