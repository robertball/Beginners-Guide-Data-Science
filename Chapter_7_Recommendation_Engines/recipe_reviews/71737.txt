wow, baked goat's cheese without baking, I love it!! The salad can always be revamped, but the spinach or mesclun mix seems to pair really well with the goats cheese. I sprinkle almonds and sometimes add some strawberries, anything goes, but the goats cheese is what makes this such a hit.

This is a good recipe that impresses guests without much effort.  I loved the texture and delicate flavor of the warm goat cheese encrusted with the garlic and breadcrumb mixture, but thought the spinach needed a little something extra.  Next time I will try adding a good amount of freshly shredded carrot and/or diced red or yellow pepper to add color and variety.  I would definately make this again; it's very quick and easy.

I LOVE Goat Cheese Salads, and this one just didn't do it for me.  I'll try it again sometime with a different Goat Cheese (I'm sure that the one you pick makes or breaks this salad).  I also had trouble coating the cheese with bread crumbs the way I wanted to, but that was probably just user error.

This was very good and easy! I did put the breaded cheese in the oven for a few minutes to crisp it a little more. Also put red onions and carrots on the salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice salad.  It was rather difficult "baking" the goat cheese.  I was impatient and put it all in the pan, making it very challenging to flip them.  So do only a few at a time, like the directions say.  I used panko for the bread crumbs.  I also made the oil and vinegar into a dressing, whisking in  1/2 tsp. dijon mustard and 1/2 tsp. mayo (as emulsifiers) and adding a pinch of salt and pepper.  Some real bacon bits were a good addition too.

I thought the 'baked' goat cheese was delicious...I used panko 'italian style' bread crumbs..I thought the cool greens with the warm cheese was good but next time I might try sauteed spinach with sun-dried tomatoes ...Thanks for a great recipe

YUM! I added some red onion to the spinach but otherwise left it as is. The goat cheese was a wonderful addition and this made a perfect lunch for me today. Thank you Radiogirl!

This was my  first experience using goat cheese.  I used panko bread crumbs, gave a nice crunch coating! I added chopped walnuts and fresh blueberries.  Next time I will blend the oil and vinegar together before putting it on the salad. It's missing some flavor though, even with the cheese.  The cheese would be great served on top of filet mignon!

Very yummy. For those people who said they had a hard time slicing the goat cheese.. try this tip. Put in freezer for 10 minutes to firm it up before slicing, and then use dental floss (unflavored of course). You should get nice even slices.And I highly recommended panko, which are crispy Japanese bread crumbs.  I added a thin slice of granny smith apple under the goat cheese. Makes a nice presentation, plus also keeps the goat cheese in one piece when you lay it on the salad.

As written, a generous three stars, as a 1:1 ratio of olive oil to vinegar is off. That's waaay too much vinegar! A ratio of 3:1 olive oil to vinegar is traditionally used and even 2:1 is all right if you prefer your dressing more acidic. Other than that this was a pretty and delicious salad, one that I had to make just for myself as Hubs wouldn't get NEAR anything with goat cheese.  I used a lighter red wine vinegar as I don't care for balsamic and added toasted walnuts, dried cherries and thinly sliced red onion.

Great recipe! Really took the strong bite out of the goat cheese for a smooth flavor. I used red tip lettuce instead of spinach and red wine vinegar instead of balsamic and it was still delicious

I made this for dinner last night and loved it! We grilled some shrimp, added dried cranberries and almonds and it was delicious.  I was also lazy and did a store bought dressing - Garlic Expressions. It went great.

So simple and delicious. I threw it together in 5 minutes. What a great easy way to prepare the cheese. I also added a diced tomato. Everyone, including my 3 boys, 7,5, and 2 ate every bite. That doesn't happen often with a salad.

When I first saw this recipe I figured the goat cheese was baked. After I read the directions, I figured it still might not taste bad. I was quite disappointed. Next time I have breaded goat cheese with my salad, I'll take the extra steps to do it right.

This was so yummy! I added sliced tomatoes on top of the spinach.  I used crumbled goat cheese and just tossed it around in the bread crumb mixture.  Very good.  It compliments the Steak Pinwheels recipe here very well.

I think this has lots of potential, but I didn't get the right goat cheese, I guess.  It was way too soft!  Goopy in your hand, doesn't hold together.  It was Chevre.  I got the herb cheese, which was great.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe but put the cheese in the oven for 10 minutes to toast the coating and warm the cheese.  Also added tomatoes and used store bought balsamic vinaigrette.

As others have reviewed, the cheese was actually not baked. Very hard to keep slices of goat cheese from crumbling-- next time I will just crumble it in the pan with the breadcrumbs, etc. But it was yummy.

Omigosh, sooo good! And pretty healthy- compared to what I normally make off of this website! ;) I just used the Spring Mix salad I had in the fridge and instead of bread crumbs, I decided to smash up these yummy little crostinis I bought from my supermarket's bakery to create my own, pre-seasoned, bread-crumbs. This was so good! I also added extra crumbled goat cheese to the salad that fell off when I was slicing it, some tomatoes, and more crostinis- chopped in half to look like croutons. I also used more olive oil & vinegar than called for but thats how I like it. :) This was delicious!!!!! *Also, I would add some sliced steak to this next time I have some on hand- it seems like it would taste great with this salad!

I'm giving this salad a 5 because I love this way of "baking" chevre.  It's a delicious and elegant, not to mention simple, addition to a spinach salad.  I think the salad is good as it is, but it would be even better with the addition of almonds, maybe sliced pears or strawberries.

This was very good! The breadcrumb/goat cheese topping has great potential for lots of things! I think I'll try it on roasted asparagus or tomatoes next time! Mmmm...

Warm goat cheese salad is one of my favorites. This was a nice base recipe for me and then I added what we like.   I put together the salad with our choice of ingredients.  For the goat cheese, I did use Panko bread crumbs.  However, I mixed the bread crumbs with my fresh herbs from my herb garden.  I chopped fresh basil, cilantro, oregano (really depends on what I have on hand) along with a little crushed black pepper, and a tiny bit of crushed red pepper.   Makes a delicious goat cheese.   For me, this made a nice recipe into something really great.  However, that will depend on your own individual taste.  It's also very easy to make.

I revamped the salad with homemade ezekiel bread breadcrumbs instead of store bought, apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic, and added walnuts (along with the goat cheese and olive oil of course) and it was the best salad I have had in a long time! I love this recipe and will definitely try it again!

Didn't make the salad, but made the faked baked goat cheese.  It was soooo yummy!  Just one slice adds a lot to any salad.  Really special!

I'm always thrilled to find a truly yummy salad.  This is lovely with something not-so-ordinary to offer guests.  I included 2 slices of canned pears and a sprinkling of walnuts with each and used a Spring Green salad mix.

Excellent flavour and very easy.  My 5 year old daughter loved the goat cheese and my husband gave it a 5 star!  I did add some cucumber and tomates as my family loves their veggies.

Crumbled the goat cheese into the garlic and used TLC Crackers crushed instead of breadcrumbs - - but loved it! Love Balsamic salads and this one's a new twist.

Love cheese and love this recipe! Turns a boring salad into something I can't wait to eat and the family loves it too!! I  found it helpful when using the goat cheese that comes cylindrical shaped to unwrap it completely and put in the freezer just long enough to make slicing easier.

So simple, and so delicious!  The melted goat cheese with garlic breadcrumbs is a nice topping to the fresh spinach.  I drizzled with dark balsamic vinegar and Tuscan Herb olive oil purchased locally.  This is an easy dish to serve company.

Perfectly simple recipe. Made it exactly as directed first time. Second time added dried sweet cranberries and walnut pieces. Awesome either way. Literally takes minutes.

I really only used this recipe for the goat cheese, but it really was delicious for that.  I couldn't get the goat cheese to fry in nice slices, but I ended up just basically frying it all together, and that turned out pretty delicious.  I used this recipe for the salad, dressing and walnuts - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/90500/beet-salad-with-goat-cheese/  My husband and kids were less appreciative so I probably won't make it again but it was really delicious!

Very quick to make. The spinach leaves and breaded goat cheese makes it filling and light. It will be a summer staple, for sure.

Very good- 1 tip after coating the goat cheese withe the breadcrumbs re-wrap it in cling wrap and place in the freezer for about 10 minutes. It makes slicing easier

My husband made this for us last night and it was fabulous.  He followed the recipe as written except added some fresh raspberries to the salad.  We also whisked the oil and vinegar into a dressing instead of drizzling separately.  He thought the breadcrumb mixture may absorb the butter more evenly if it was mixed in a little at a time instead of all at once.

The stove top "baked" goat cheese melts in your mouth and is so simple!  I used crushed whole grain crackers in place of bread crumbs and it is so yummy.  I added sliced strawberries and toasted walnuts and topped with a strawberry vinaigrette.  Soooo good and soooo satisfying!

I loved this simple and elegant salad.  I didn't have goat cheese slices so I used crumbled feta and it still worked.  I would maybe add some cherry tomatoes and real bacon bits next time just to jazz it up a bit but lovely none the less.

I am obsessed with goat cheese, so therefore it was good. The dressing was a bit to tangy.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I wasn't even sure I liked goat cheese that much, but warmed up with the breadcrumbs and drizzled with the oil and vinegar it was excellent.  Makes an impressive replacement for the quotidian side salad, and very easy too.  Will definitely make again!!
