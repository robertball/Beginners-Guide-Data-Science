Delicious!  Only change I made was to cut back on the jalapeños because I am a wimp.  I used on pepper and it was just about right for me. I loved how the sweetness of the yam contrasted with the spices. I served this with fat free sour cream and in whole wheat tortillas

So delicious! I made a few changes based on the Caribbean-style tacos I've enjoyed at restaurants. I used more Cajun seasoning and tomatillo salsa and a little less chili powder. I served it topped with cilantro, shredded cabbage, crushed pineapple and plain Greek yogurt. Spicy and sweet all in the same bite. 
I used 3 jalapeno peppers, but I don't think 4 would be too many.

This recipe was great.  I was a little nervous to try it because of the interesting combo, but WOW am I glad I did.  Even my dad and brother loved them and they are extremely picky eaters.  I only used one jalapeno and served them with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  I will definitely make these again!

Soooooooooo Good!!! I've never reviewed anything before but I tried this recipe because I had both the turkey and the yam to use up before they were bad and OMG am I glad I did.  Being on a diet and always looking for recipes using ground turkey because there's only so much ground turkey a person can eat. 

I had only jarred jalapeno's so used those instead and didn't have tomatillo salsa either so I improvised with a can of Ortega chopped green chili's and some whole tomatillo's from a can that I chopped.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I will use this one again and again.

We loved these!  I used 2 jalapeno's and 1 habanero.  The recipe sounds like it's going to be extremely spicy but the yam totally balances out the peppers.  For dinner I topped these with sour cream and cheddar chesse.  I took the leftovers for lunch the next day and ate it without the tortillas and I loved it just as much.  Note: cut the yams as small as possible so you get a perfect combo of sweet and spicy in every bite

We eat Ayurvedically (seasonally) and have moved from ground beef to turkey with the beginning of spring.  Problem is: my husband does not like ground turkey.  We ALL loved this recipe, including my 4 year old son!  I did not use creole seasoning, made my own chili powder, I topped the tacos with a tiny bit of cheddar, guacamole, and a drizzle of yogurt. I served them on warm (soft) corn tortillas.  So good!

This recipe was amazingly good! I was a bit apprehensive about yams and turkey, but the combination was great with the sweet and spicy of both. I pretty much followed the recipe accept I used whole grain green onion tortillas for a bit of a healthier touch and I decreased the jalepenos to 2 instead of 4. It was spicy with 2, so I can't imagine what it would have been like with 4 and we really like spicy foods. We added alittle more of the salsa as a topping and my husband LOVED it and he is picky about turkey recipes. This will be a regular dish in our house and I do think it could be served at a restaurant it's THAT good!

This was different and YUMMY!  Ok, you know you have to substitute sometimes - I only had 2 jalpeno peppers, so I put a little caynne pepper in there - and had no idea where to get tomatillo salsa (but I had all the other ingredients at the house).  I bought FOR $.50 a can of Red Gold that had the tomatoes and green chilles in it!  Worked fine for me! Oh - and my yam was really left over sweet potatoes we cooked for Sunday's dinner....so mine was a little sweeter!
LOVED IT!  I think I will eat the leftovers from it again tonight!

Very easy to make and delicious. Since I didn't have salsa verde, I used Pace chunky salsa and it came out very nicely! Today I made the original version and it's still very tasty.

These were phenomenal! I don't like spicy food, but I halved the jalapenos and added some red bell peppers and it was great.

Very good.  Very spicy!  wow.  Add some sour cream or ranch dressing to cut the bite and make it creamy.  Other wise if you like it really hot keep it the way it is.  YUM!

This is going in the regular dinner rotation.  So easy to make and so delicious.  I did have to make 2 changes.  I used serrano peppers instead of jalapenos so the kids would eat it but then just served fresh jalapenos on top of the adults.  I also added more then a cup of salsa verde.  More like 1 3/4 C.  Served them up with some mexican queso fresco cheese, sour cream, shredded cabbage, and avocado.  There were no leftovers and the kids are still talking about them.

Wonderful!  These were a hit with everyone, including my 4-yr-old (who likes spices).  I used some canned roasted chilis and a whole serrano in place of the jalapenos, since that is what I had.  I half-cooked the yam before peeling and cubing, since that makes it easier to cut.  Next time, I'll dice the yam quite small to spread it out more evenly.  This recipe is a real winner, healthy and delicious.

I found this recipe while searching for something other than chili or meatloaf to make with ground turkey. My husband raised his eyebrows and my daughter said she just wouldn’t eat dinner that night (she does not like yams, sweet potatoes or turkey).  I said “Just try it, it might be good.” OMG!!! Everyone loved it! It is now my daughter’s favorite recipe. She even asked me to make it instead of turkey for Thanksgiving! I now make it about once a week. It seems like I get a craving for “Yammy Tacos” every few days and I just have to have it.  Thanks Fooddude for sharing this unusual and amazingly delicious recipe!
My one tip: If you don’t like spicy, ditch the Cajun seasoning and add ½ tsp paprika instead.

You're silly not to give this recipe a try! I was looking for a recipe to use my ground chicken with and stumbled upon this. I wish I could give more than 5 stars that is how great it is!! 
I did double the recipe, but only used 1 large jalapeno because I have teenagers & small children (I didn't want it too hot for the little ones). I also added 1/2 cup of baby bella mushrooms, diced real small) because I needed to use them up. 
It was gone! Not one bit left for my husbands lunch the next day.

Delish! However, I did add a bit of Splenda to give it a  little more sweetness.  Otherwise, very good and what an awesome way to sneak those sweet potatoes in!

This was excellent! I changed a few things. I used leftover Turkey from Christmas. Shred the turkey, one jalapeno, taco seasoning packet in place of the seasonings. For the salsa i added homemade salsa. No tomatillo salsa. added lettuce, cheese and sourcream. :) YUMM

Yams are so healthy and cheap, if only there were ways to use them besides topping with marshmallows for Thanksgiving. Enter this recipe! It's so good... one of my husband's favorites. It's pretty forgiving, so don't worry too much about getting the right amount of everything. For one thing, I only use one unseeded jalapeno (too lazy to put on gloves to seed/chop them). I also don't have Cajun seasoning, so I threw in some paprika, oregano, pepper, and lemon juice instead. Also, I add a LOT more cumin. Top the mixture with some tomato chunks, homemade salsa, cheese, and maybe some plain yogurt, and YAY awesome tacos.

Oh my gosh! This was so good, my nephew hates yams and we never told him what they were and he ate it all+ a second helping. Made it for my parents and our entire family are FOOD SNOBS and everyone rated it a "10". Used with a avocado salsa pureed with jalapenos, pablanos, onion, etc. Found this sauce on internet

Made this tonight & added some lime juice to the mixture. I also melted in a package of goat cheese which added a delicious creamy flavour. I cooked some quinoa in chicken broth with pepper & lime juice, and served on top of the quinoa. Super yummy!

Very good!  Refreshingly different from the usual tacos we make and also easy to customize for the spice-intolerant toddlers in the house.

My hubby and I love this recipe.  To cut down on calories we don't use the tortilla  but put it over a bed of lettuce then garnish with tomatoes and plain yogurt.  (I like ketchup on it also)  We feel like it is a healthy meal.  Usually ground turkey is pretty bland so we were happy it was so spicy and good and very flavorful.

Five stars, for sure.

I used what I had on hand.  Pictsweet frozen Brown Sugar Sweet Potatoes, cut smaller (the sweetness turned out to be a great thing! One canned chipotle pepper with adobo sauce (in lieu of chili powder), a few jarred jalapeno pepper slices, and red salsa.  

Holy smokes this was good.  Seriously, I knew it was a keeper at first bite. Don't be afraid to use those glazed sweet potatoes.  It's easy and tasty!

This is a great recipe and has been in my rotation since I found it over a year ago. It's fairly easy, the results are delicious, and it can be adapted to suit the spice level you are looking for by either including more or less jalapenos and starting with a spicier or milder salsa. The leftovers reheat well, too. But perhaps the best surprise of all was how awesome this mixture tastes as a tamale filling. It makes a lot and there are just two people in my home, but the leftovers never go to waste. You can't go wrong!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations! Delicious! I thought I was a semi-spicy tolerant person, but one large jalapeno pepper was plenty for me. I also doubled the garlic as I do with all recipes and also served with corn tortillas as to make the meal gluten-free. A little tomatillo salsa and cilantro on the taco as a garnish added a nice cool flavor in addition to the already present sweet and spiciness. Next time I think I might offer some sour cream on the side as another reviewer recommended in case anyone needs to cool it down a little. Amazing!!!!!

I make a variation on this recipe and it is DE-LISH. I add half a tbsp oil to the onions and cook those up a bit before adding the turkey, then I put in the second half tbsp and brown the turkey. I left off the jalapeno and cilantro because I'm not a fan. Instead of the tomatillo salsa I just added diced tomatoes - about a cup worth. I followed the recipe pretty close for the other spices - probably added a little more chili powder. Adding sour cream to the finished product cools it a little bit. Very yummy!

Flavour was great! I did not add the jalapeño peppers, used green peppers instead and added lettuces and sour cream to it to make it Fajitas instead of Tacos. Really enjoyed it, and will make again.

I was so excited to try these and they were just ok. Not sure if I didn't cook them right or what but it was lacking flavor (despite all of the ingredients).  I used sweet potatoes because it is what I had on hand and there was just something missing from them.  Won't be making agin.

I really loved these tacos!
I made a few modifications: I used a 1 lb. of ground turkey, increased the spices, used 3/4 cups of the salsa verde and served it on corn tortillas that I toasted over an open flame. YUM!
I also did a version were I skipped the tortillas altogether and served this with regular salsa in addition to the tomatillo salsa over shredded lettuce as a taco salad. That was also excellent!

Have made these several times with just a few tweaks.   I only use 1 jalapeño, omit the cajun seasoning(since I don't ever have) and replace the cilantro with parsley(since I'm not a huge cilantro fan).  We like to top with lettuce, cheese and sour cream...but I've had without and delicious both ways!   My teenage kids said that these have moved near the top of the their favorite meals list!

I came upon this recipe trying to figure out how to cook the ground turkey I took out of my freezer.  I was leery about this recipe. 


I'm not really a fan of ground turkey but in an effort to eat healthy I thought I'd try to make something bearable with it.

I don't like sweet and savory together but I tried this recipe anyway because I know that you can make sweet potatoes both savory and sweet.

As I prepared the recipe I hoped the flavors would be good at the very least. When I tasted the final outcome it was absolutely delicious! It was so good I am looking forward to the leftovers for my next meal.

I am so happy this recipe turned out so great. I now have one more recipe that's healthy and delicious.

Give this recipe a try it is wonderful!

We liked these.  The yams added an interesting texture to your typical tacos.  My cajun seasoning mix was strong and so it was a little overpowering but still good.  Choose your cajun seasoning wisely or adjust the quantity according to your tastes. Next time I will cut back slightly on the cajun seasoning and may add some black beans too.

I was a little nervous to try this because who in their right mind puts yams in a taco!?! But... I was also anxious because of the rave reviews. I’m always trying to reinvent the taco, and this did just that! I absolutely loved this dish, and so did my picky, taco loving husband! I didn’t change a thing, except for the amount of jalapeños I used. Thank you for adding a new taco recipe to my box.

Very tasty recipe!  I used more (homemade) salsa than what was called for -- turkey is very lean and it needed more moisture.

I cannot believe how good that tasted!  I was looking for something different to do with ground turkey; i had all other ingredients on hand except for the peppers (I substituted 1/4 tsp cayenne).  I prefer corn tortillas over flour, but that doesn't really change the recipe much.  Even though I read all these 5 star reviews, I was still pretty skeptical until I took my first bite!  I tried as written (still 5 stars) but I prefer it with the cayenne, and a little shredded cheddar and sour cream.  This was an easy dinner and I'm looking forward to leftovers.

Awesome! Very tasty. Just left out jalepanos and used Mexican seasoning and lime juice! Fun meal to make. Pealed or not pealed potatoes doesn’t change much if you want to take less time.

This is one of my to go weekly recipes.  I do take the time to roast my yams in the oven.  I think it adds a nice roasted taste to the yams.  I use our local home salsa verde from our local Mexican market in town.  Topped with some fresh crema (creamy sour cream).  The family really enjoy these tacos, and also depending on how hot the jalapos are I will put one or two in the mix.  Totally recommend this recipe. Easy stuff!

Cook + prep time is a little longer than indicated, even on a 'greater than medium' flame. I added avocado for serving, which in my opinion makes everything better. Easy and repeatable, will definitely make again.

We loved these alternative tacos!  I wish I would have used the 4 jalapenos as written, I got scared to use all 4 because of the reviews.  But we like things hot, so 4 would have been fine.  Actually, I used 2 Serrano peppers, which tend to be hotter.  One without the seeds and membranes and one with them.  I did add some chopped cabbage for crunch and used corn tortillas for a more authentic taste.  Yum!

This was soooo good! The recipe was amazingly easy to follow. The only thing I did different was use three jalapeños instead of four, next time I will use all four choice because the recipe blended everything so perfectly it wasn't too spicy at all!!! Loved It

These are delicious.  They're a little spicy for my taste so I shall cut down on the jalapenos next time or, better yet, add sour cream to my taco.  I served these with Mexican White Rice from this site and a can of refried beans.

Great! Used chicken, regular salsa, added black beans, only 2 jalapenos& toned down the other spices for our taste. I had it on lettuce leaves but the family had it on flour wraps for soft tacos.

YUMMY!  Like others I used half of the amount of jalapeños, and served with cut up avocado, cabbage coleslaw and sour cream.  My family loved it and everyone had seconds, no leftovers.  This dish will be made again.

Very good. My husband who is a meat and potato man wanted me to make it with ground beef and white potatoes.  I refused and made as written except for cutting back on the jalapeño.  We both loved it . He takes a thermos to work.  He asked me if he can have it for lunch tomorrow over rice. Definitely a keeper.

This is such an awesome alternative to plain ground beef tacos!  Loved this recipe!  I did use a little more salsa verde than the recipe called for because I like it so much.

We did not care for this. 4 jalapeños are way too much, I noticed as I was preparing and stopped at two. But otherwise followed the recipe as written. No one in my family liked it enough to want to try it again.

Tried these tonight and I agree with the 5 star rating. They are delish! It was a nice variation from the usual taco recipe. I am on a low cal/low carb healthy eating plan and these work perfect with low carb whole wheat tortillas and fat free sour cream. YUMM!

A little bit of work but well worth it!! I doubled the recipe (love leftovers) used 7 jalapeños, forgot tomatillo salsa so used regular & it was fantastic! Topped with avocado will try Greek yogurt next time. Only thing I would do differently is chop the sweet potatoes a little smaller.

I made it without the yams because my boyfriend doesn't like yams. Next time I am going to make it with yams when he isn't around. Still delicious. I feel like I've upgraded from package taco seasoning to the real stuff. So good! Thanks! :)

Very tasty. I cut way back on the chili powder and only one jalapeño and the kids were still dying from the hotness. I think next time I will eliminate the chili pepper from theirs, otherwise, everyone really enjoyed the flavor.

This was forwarded to me by a friend, and then another friend talked about how great it is - we are all trying healthier eating habits.  I was skeptical, and I'll say I can't wait to make this again!  It it fabulous!!  I wish every "healthy" meal tasted this amazing.  Made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  I did garnish with some low fat sour cream - just a dab.  Totally optional - delicious without it.  Two of us had it for lunch and dinner in the same day and not a single bite leftover for the next day.  I will be doubling the recipe from now on!

Great recipe! I used only two Jalapeno peppers and it still had a nice
kick. I left out the Cajun seasoning since I didn't have any on hand but it wasn't missed. I served this with tortilla wraps and hard shell tacos. This is a really versatile recipe that I would serve over rice or as a taco salad. Definitely making it again.

Followed recipe. It is so good! Have made it several times since. Definitely a favorite when yams are in season. The yams are sweet and compliment the turkey, tomatillo salsa, and spices perfectly.

Absolutely delicious. Had just the right amount of heat and yam is not overwhelming. Will be making this again!

Oh wow this was really awesome, to make it healthier next time I am going to double the sweet potatoes and half the meat, but the way it is right now is amazing!

My family loves this.  I use chili spices and pico de gallo instead of Cajun spices and tomatillo salsa just because that is what we have.  This is one of our granddaughter's favorite recipes.

I make these often as a quick go-to meal that I can eat on all week. These are great! And taste really good with the addition if cinnamon, and a jar of sweet corn salsa.

Very good! Only used two jalapenos (personal preference) and regular salsa (all I had in the house) but otherwise made exactly as directed. Will cook again!

Wonderful flavor. I added extra Jalapenos and did not have any Cajun seasoning. Is on my list to make again

We loved this! Great way to do something different with sweet potatoes AND boring 'ol turkey. I did like one reviewer said and served with cabbage. Thank you for a great recipe!
