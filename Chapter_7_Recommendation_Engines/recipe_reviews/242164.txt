I have never made chicken cassiatore before so I poured over many recipes before choosing one.  I am so glad I chose this one.  It is delicious!  My husband had seconds.  The only thing I did was add a third tablespoon of Sherry wine (not cooking sherry).  I also added more garlic because we love garlic.  Other than that made it just as recipe was written. Thanks for such a good recipe.

Wow! This is a tasty recipe! I wanted chicken Italian-style other than the usual chicken Parmesan, and this recipe hit the spot! It's a tad time-consuming, but it's easy to make. The chicken turned out very tender. I used only one very large sweet onion because that's all I had on hand. The amount of black pepper as written produces a very peppery dish, as a warning. Try this recipe!!!!

Definite winner!  I did not use the yellow zucchini and I added an extra can of tomato sauce. Also, I did not use the red pepper flakes; I added a Fresno chili instead. Hubby and I found it seasoned perfectly and quite yummy!

very delicious ! I did it all on the stove top. Added the chicken back into the vegetables and let it simmer about 20 min. Served it with rice.

Very flavorful! I wanted to make a cacciatore with b/s thighs and sliced peppers, and I'm really glad I chose this recipe. I made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. I used 1 large onion, 1 zucchini, no squash, no rosemary because I forgot it :) I didn't use tomato sauce, I used a can of diced tomatoes and half a jar of spaghetti sauce. It *is* peppery, as another reviewer said, but that was a plus for me.  It does take a bit of time, but just boil up some pasta and you have a fairly easy, delicious one-dish dinner.  Oh, and it took about an hour in Calphalon dutch oven for me, so I'd definitely check before letting it go 90 minutes.  Will definitely make many more times.

Really great flavor! I didn't use zucchini, and used less tomato sauce and more chicken broth, and cut out the cooking sherry. But otherwise, I followed the process of th recipe - I loved the idea of baking the chicken with the veggies and sauce. Turned out tender and delicious! Will certainly make more next time, as there was barely enough left over for lunches for tomorrow.
