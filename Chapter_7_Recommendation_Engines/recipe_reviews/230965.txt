I have to say I enjoyed this recipe, I made it for one of my clients, she's elderly and lives alone.  So I cut back on the ingrediants.  I think it made her day, having something hot cooking on the oven, and it smelled, well like "home!"  She enjoyed telling me stories while I chopped and cooked.  I did it on the stove also, I prefer to do all my cooking on the stove.  My only change was I chopped everything very very small.  It was great, I will definetly make this again!  I loved the difference the searing the meat did!!  Thanks!!

Nice basic stew recipe.  Try adding a can of cream of mushroom soup to the pot as an added pleasure!  I like to add a green veggie to this, green beans or peas work well for me (last 30 minutes).  BTW, use ONLY a high quality balsamic when cooking!  A nice variation would be to add a pint of red sauce, or a small can of tomato paste.  Love and good luck to all!

This will stick to your ribs!  I omitted the potatoes since I was serving it over noodles, but otherwise would include them.  I did toss in some Baby Bellas, which I halved.  My biggest change was to eliminate the butter and cut the olive oil back to 2 tbs and browning my meat in 2 batches.  I used G'ma's old cast iron Dutch oven so after assembling all and bringing to temperature, I put it in a 275F oven for most of the afternoon.  Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe to the T, except added a handful of chopped mushrooms! I did put in the crockpot  after deglazing the pan & let cook on low for about 5 hours. Even my finicky 16 year old devoured it without picking all the veggies out. Definitely one to stay in my recipe box!

This is a different recipe for beef stew, than I have ever made.  Really good flavors.  I took advantage of a little red wine, to deglaze the pan, then added the beef broth.  Don't skip the paprika, nice layers of flavor.  This is a keeper.

This is an amazing beef stew. I seasoned the flour with Montreal steak seasoning, which I think helped the flavor of the beef, and added some peas in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Good stuff!

I tossed everything into a crockpot on high for 4 hours (normally I do 8 low, but got a late start!) using my day before beef broth from another crockpot project, and let it do it's thing. I also added a can of Italian stewed tomatoes and towards the end a little tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. Definitely a 'set it and forget it' project for me!

Just made the slow simmer beef stew and it is amazing!! I added cut up potatoes to the recipe instead of using noodles.  So glad I tried this recipe.  It will become a winter staple in our home!

Good recipe with good flavor. ONE HUGE PROBLEM THOUGH! If you double or triple the recipe, DO NOT double or triple the butter and olive oil used to brown the beef! It does not mention this in the recipe, but it makes the stew taste greasy!

This recipe was fantastic! I made it according to the recipe for a ski weekend with another couple. It was perfect! Everyone loved it! I have been struggling to find a stew that doesn't taste boring or rather plain and this is it!!

This is the best beef stew I have ever had!!! The only changes I made -used cornstarch instead of flour, used 1tsp balsamic vinegar, and I added quinoa before adding the veggies. I simmered it for three hours and it was soooo yummy!! Thx for this recipe :)

I have made this twice now, and I had to take the time to review it this time because I was reminded of  how wonderful it is! I did not  make any big changes at all. I use fresh garlic instead of the powder, and about an hour before it's done I use a couple tablespoons flour with a little corn starch mixed with a small amount of warm water to get it to desired thickness. I do end up adding more balsamic vinegar and worcestershire to make it even more luscious and hearty. I get the stew meat from Central Market (I live in Dallas) and they use use scraps of filet and other premium cuts of meat, so oh my goodness!! It is one delicious dish!!!

I added green beans, a bit of sea salt and pepper, and a tad more Worcester Sauce. Hit with everyone. Prep time took WAY longer than listed for someone that doesn't cook as often, but worth it.

Best beef stew ever! I used 1 can beef broth and 1 can petite diced tomatos. No celery, just cause I didn't have any, and no vinegar. Cooked on the stove. Served with French bread.

Very good beef stew! It was a little soupy, but I was able to add a flour mixture in to help thicken it up. Next time we plan. on adding wild rice and cream of mushroom soup to kick it up a notch.

I made a few minor changes by using fresh garlic and herbs, but really the ingredient that makes this shine is the balsamic. It adds just a touch of sweetness that brightens it up just enough. I don't have a sweet tooth and would never think of adding balsamic, but to me, it's the key ingredient! Bravo!

Amazing! I did reduce the oil and butter down to about three tablespoons total. I added red along with regular baking potatoes, portobello mushrooms in place of 1 cup of the celery, but otherwise made as written and it was so so good. Fiance and kids loved it too! It's going in the cookbook and the cold weather rotation for sure :)

Great recipe. Would never think to add vinegar to stew, but it gives it a nice tangy taste. I skipped the butter and it was delicious!

Really great flavor!!! I only had 1 1/2 # stew meat, used about 1/2 the vegetables and beef broth. I did use all the spices called for,  saved the recipe and it will be  my go-to stew recipe from now on!

This was excellent.  Boyfriend gave it 4.5 stars, which is pretty good for him.  I made 1/2 of the recipe with some tweaks, as follows:
- used 2 small canned potatoes (saved peeling time)
- Used 1/2 small onion, leaving it in big pieces (boyfriend doesn't like onion)
- Put Montreal steak seasoning in flour mixture before adding beef (did not use seasoned salt).  Saved remaining flour to thicken it up at the end
- Added 1 bay leaf
- Added red cooking wine after an hour of cooking 
- Used gravy master instead of the Worcestershire, since we don't like that flavor
- added a little bit of fresh pepper
Note to self:  boyfriend asked for more beef and less carrots next time (there was a lot of carrots)

Oh goodness!  I cut the broth to 7 C, but added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, juice included.  This stew is thinner than what we are used to, but so delicious, and with added biscuits just about perfection.

I did make this in the slow cooker after I had browned the beef and onions on the stove. It was a tasty stew but I made some changes , I added fresh dill and tomato paste near the end to add more flavour and to thicken. A wonderful recipe.

This was delicious.  Not a big fan of leftovers so I cut the recipe in half (except for the beef broth).  Turned out great!

This is my second favorite recipe I’ve found in this site (my wife’s too). !! I add bay leaf (personal preference) and it’s really really good. Once I didn’t have enough broth and tried adding apple cider to give it a nice fall taste....don’t do that it made it bitter lol

I like other recipes I've tried from this website better. This is more of a beef soup than a stew. I prefer a thicker, creamier broth.

This is phenomenal, even with half the amount of oil and butter called for.  I added half a packet of Lipton beef stew seasoning to the flour, and some extra veggies, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  So delicious, thank you!

Loved this recipe! Don't know what's so special about it, but it works! I have made beef stew countless times, but this recipe turned out so well. I made everything to the tee, except I used fresh thyme and dried oregano for herbs because that's all I had. I'm thinking the balsamic vinegar was the key.

I dislike beef stew, but the hubs loves his beef, so I tried this minus the potatoes (we prefer mashed) , and I have to say this was absolutely delicious. I mean delicious, seriously delicious. I've made it at least 5 times for Sunday supper. I too used the crockpot after deglazing. Did I say this was delicious? No, really.

Cooked in a crock pot for 4 to 5 hrs on high.  Added some montreal steak seasoning instead of seasonall to flour.   Sliced portabella mushrooms. Used 4 Tsp of corn starch toward the end to help thicken it up.

I used a cubed turnip instead of potatoes and tossed in a pack of Knorrs onion soup mix for fun. Also added some Montreal Steak Spice when I browned the beef up. Served it up for dinner with some crusty Italian bread & everyone loved it !

Good stuff. I only had a pound of stew meat, so I halved the amount of butter, olive oil, broth and veggies, but still used the same amount of flour and seasonings. That made the sauce a little thicker and gave it plenty of flavor, didn't make it come out over-seasoned. Didn't serve it over anything. Just with French bread on the side. Love the one pot method. I'll make this one again.

Loved this recipe.  I cup the recipe in 1/2.  I added 1 cup of hearty red wine and 1 bay leaf.  Added a little cornstarch to thicken. My new favourite beef stew recipe.

Nice beef stew. I only used half the amount of beef broth and I had plenty of gravy ! The whole amount would have turned this into a soup ..
My stew was ready in 2 1/2 hours. I served with biscuits.

Absolutely delicious. However it only took 2 hours for everything to be cooked. If I left it longer the veggies would be mush. I am still giving 5 stars.

Absolutely love it! I have been using this recipe for 3 years now (minus the vinegar)  and it gets rave reviews. This will be the only beef stew recipe I will ever use again!

Followed the recipe exactly except for a few things because I did not have them on hand.  I used only half of what the recipe called for since I only had 1 lb. of stew meat. Replaced all purpose flour with wheat all purpose flour. Used Italian seasoning instead of just basil. Fajita seasoning in place of seasoned salt. No worchenshire sauce. I'm sure it would have tasted better with it. Had no garlic powder so I used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic in the last minute after adding the onions. Regardless of the changes, it turned out so delicious. My toddler loved it because it was so tender.

Follow the recipe as fat as ingredients were concerned. I only used 4 cups of beef broth which covered everything. Best stew I have ever made.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Added seasoned salt to the flour mixture to coat the beef. Served over rice, and it's always a hit.

This was absolutely delicious! I did have to modify just a bit - omitted the parsley, fewer carrots,  and Knorr boullion instead of  canned broth. This is definitely a new family favorite! Thank you for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I did different was add portabella mushrooms. Followed the recipe exactly other than that. Wonderful!!
