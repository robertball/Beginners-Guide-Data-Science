After years of perfecting, with a little help from a friend, this is what makes a dessert that my guys say is "Like Crack!"  2 Cans of BUTTERMILK Grands biscuits, 1 3/4 cup sugar, 3 tbs cinnamon, 1 full cup of butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Mix one cup of sugar & the cinnamon - dip cut up biscuit sections in this and arrange in a heavily greased bundt pan. Pour remaining cin sugar mix on top.  Melt the butter and add the last 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar - bring to a light boil.  Pour over biscuit pieces.  Bake at 350 for 45-50 minutes.  **I always layer in a can of Apple Pie filling with the biscuits before baking, as well**

I'd never made/had monkey bread before, but as my first attempt, this recipe was extrememly easy to follow and make. I had fun cutting up the biscuits and rolling them in the cinnasugar and watching it take shape as it rose in the bundt. And the final results...delicious! Each piece of the bread is coated with cinnamon and sugar and gooey icing that you can just pull apart and eat for desert or for a breakfast treat. Everyone love, love, loved this. The only change I made to the recipe is a sprinkled the bottom of my bundt pan with pecans before I began layering.

I used buttermilk biscuits.  Cut into small pieces, put a bit of cream cheese inside and then roll into a ball.  Also made a bit extra topping.  Soooooo good!!!! We make this every year for Christmas morning.

Excellent! I used brown sugar instead of white and turned out great. If you want bread to stick together tight, I would recommend more sauce.

Everyone thought I had made the bread from scratch. I did buy a good brand of biscuits, and I chose to use unsalted butter instead of margarine. Very good and very simple to make.

Wow!! I have made twice now and everyone that's had it, loves it. 
I used frozen white bread dough. The second time, I let it defrost, cut it (I skipped dipping my scissors in water and had no issues), rolled it in sugar and put in the fridge until the morning. I just used a 9x13 pan and a 7x9 pan, there was a lot! When I pulled it out in the morning it was huge!! I followed the rest of the directions exactly and they came out great. What an impressive thing to make for a brunch which is still super easy. I love recipes that I can do most of the work in advance!

Really good out of the oven!  I didn't use the other 3/4 cup of sugar mixed with butter; I used what was left of the  cinnamon sugar mixture instead.
Still plenty sweet.
2/3/13- made again as written. Yummmmmmmm.

I made this monkey bread for holiday long weekend guests.  There were no leftovers.  I made it according to the recipe and it was very good.  Next time, I might use previous suggestions and pour some of the butter/sugar mixture at intervals when filling the tube pan.   Using that pan makes it look really cool.  I am not a baker, so anything that makes me look like one is allright by me!  Thanks Darlene.

I enjoyed this but didn't love it.  The bread was a little to crispy, must have cooked it too long.

This was good, but if you happen to bake in a 9x13 pan(I didn't have a bundt pan), don't cook for more than 20 mins or so. I cooked 30 and it was a little too dry, I will make again though.

A winner as always! I use 4 tubes of the cheap 4 pack biscuits and layer a little of the cinnamon sugar mixture on each layer as it gets put in.

Monkey bread is a favorite of ours. The only thing i see missing from this recipe is the dry butterscotch pudding mix, we add sugar cinnamon and pudding mix to a bag to coat pieces, than whats left we mix brownsugar with and melted butter, and pour on top before cooking, as for measurements use your taste preferences

Very good, as is. I don't have a tube pan, so I just did it in one layer in a 13X9 and cooked it for about 10 minutes less. Still very tastey, and not gooey at all in the middle. I also made a glaze...very sweet, but a BIG hit.

This recipe was really good. But it seemed like it lacked something, that little something to send it over the moon, which it ALMOST was. I think it was brown sugar. It could have used brown sugar to give it a more caramely flavor. It was really good though.

I make this all the time.  It is a delicious, easy to assemble recipe, that turns out great every time.  This time I opted to make it with a powdered sugar glaze, but it is also delicious without.

Five stars for taste and simplicity! This was so easy to make. I didn't need to wet the kitchen shears when cutting the biscuits as suggested. They didn't stick at all. I did put the ingredients together slightly differently, though. I put some of the biscuits into a bowl, tossed them with some melted margarine, then tossed some cinnamon and sugar mixture on top and mixed. I did this several times until all the biscuit pieces were coated and in the pan. I did not top with melted butter, since it was already "in there". I topped with cream cheese icing.

I've tried so many recipes from this site without giving any reviews...sorry all! After trying this one, I felt compelled to finally register and start reviewing. It was THAT good! I used the pizza cutter, as suggested, to cut the biscuits. I also just used my leftover cinnamon-sugar mixture to combine with the melted butter at the end. I did sprinkle in some brown sugar to that mix though before pouring over the top. My five-year old didn't say a word as he ate, he just sat and hummed as he munched...something he does when he thinks the food is extra-yummy! :) Great, great recipe!!! Thanks a bunch!

I remember this from when I was a kid! My mom used to make it but she says she did it with caro syrup. Since I didn't have any on hand, I made it this way. The only changes I did make was instead of coating the biscuits with white sugar and cinnamon, I used brown sugar and cinnamon! I used the larger biscuits and had to make double of the margerine and sugar combo. But, THIS WAS AWESOME!! Makes your house smell like a bakery too!!!

This was SO tasty - I actually made one modification, though.  If you're not too concerned about calories/fat you might want to try rolling the chunks of dough in melted butter and then put the cinnamon/sugar on the outside.  I found that it was nice a gooey and came out perfect!  I had to increase the butter by an extra 1/2 cup.  Also had to increase the sugar & cinnamon mixture but just kept adding until I had enough so can't give an exact amount.

YUM!  I made this with the bread loaf dough rather than biscuit dough because it is much lower in fat and calories.  Still tastes great and no one noticed the difference!!  The best way to cover all pieces of dough with cinnamon/sugar is to put the cinnamon/sugar in large zip top bag and put the dough in bag and shake until covered.  I've also added nuts and it's great.

Our family has used 4 cans of biscuits. We mix the 3/4 cup white sugar and cinnamon in a baggie and the kids shake the quartered pieces in baggie. Then when melting butter and sugar in microwave, add the baggie mixture,too.Pour over and bake. Wonderful treat for all!

Even easier to make - buy the cinnamon buns from pillsbury - the cinnabon brand - still add the margarine - but a friend of mine - i cant take credit - she added chocolate chips in with the dough. OMG - my mouth was in heaven - but my hips paid for it :)

I lost this recipe about 5 years ago - I was so excited to see it here on AR.  Most of my kids are grown now but when they come home - this is a MUST HAVE.  Turns out perfect EVERY time.  Thank you!!!!

WOW!  This tastes like a cinnamon bun.  I used brown sugar instead of white for dipping the bisciuts and substituted unsalted butter for the margarine.  I added 1/2 C each of chopped pecans and raisins to the buttery topping.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

For those with a sweet tooth, this yummy bread hits the spot. I would recommend cutting down on the sugar. I often use brown sugar instead of the white. I have found that if you use the regular amount of sugar, it is too sweet for people, even little kids. Less is more here.

I made monkey bread this weekend our family loves it.  I used about the same recipe but reversed the steps. After quatering the dough dip it in melted butter then the sugar/cinn combine and then place the piece in the pan.

AWESOME!! We've made this 2 nights in a row now. Huge hit with the kids... even bigger hit with my hubby. The only changes I made were using butter instead of margarine and I melted 1 cup of brown sugar in with my butter rather than white sugar. It was outstanding!!! Thanks.

WONDERFUL!!  I only used 2 tubes of biscuits but kept the other measurements the same.  Once cooked it filled an entire bundt pan and the gooey caramel was spread evenly.  Will become a staple weekend breakfast around here!

it was gone within a half an hour.  Instead of using another 3/4 cup of sugar, i pour the rest of the first 3/4 cup cinnamon-sugar mixture in the 3/4cup and topped it off with the rest of the sugar.  It was soooo good. i havnt had this since i was a kid, it brought back so many memories :)

Made this at the cottage this weekend for the first time.  Limited ingredients and super easy - kids even helped. Was a hit immediately and had to get more buscuit dough so I could make a second morning!

This absolutely YUMMO! My kids love to help me make and eat it. I used brown sugar in the topping and it turned out even better. The kids especially love to have this on cold days with hot cocoa. Since I don't have a bundt or tube pan, I was able to use a square 8x8 pyrex dish and it still turned out perfecto.

Large family and I changed the prep a little to save time and make serving a little easier for me.

I added the (3 tablespoons) cinn. and (1.5 Cups) brown sugar in a huge mixing bowl, cut my biscuits up directly in it and coat all at once. 

Then I place mine in a large greased cassarole baking dish instead of a tube cake pan. Slighty shake pan back and forth to have them fill in gaps well.

Melt 1 stick of butter and the remaining cinn. and sugar until smooth and drizzle over the biscuits. 

Bake as directed above about 30 minutes... WONDERFUL!!!

I did not care for this.  The recipe as is, even adding brown sugar as suggested was really bad.  There was no flavor transferred to all the pieces.  Even the top was flavorless.  I am sticking with my own family's recipe for this breakfast favorite  Thanks Aunt Nancy!(sorry everyone..no it's not listed on this site.)

I had the same problem others had-- the bottom half was not even close to done, but the top was crispy. I also used brown sugar in the sauce. The ones that did get done though... YUM YUM YUM!!! I will keep trying with this one and see what would get them all done.

Easy, delicious, addicting, and fun!  I used two 16oz. cans of dough (and accidentally, one was "butter flavored"), but it all still worked - and turned out wonderfully.  Don't be fooled by the Bundt pan not being filled to the rim.  These little guys will RISE!  I didn't need so much cinnamon and sugar to toss the dough in (I did this in a ziplock bag..  very easy to toss in a few at a time, shake, and repeat), as I had a lot leftover.  This is a great "homemade" dessert for when you'er low on time, but you want something fun and pleasing.

Made this for my 8 year old and 2 year old children.  Didn't have the grands or buttermilk biscuits on hand so I used what I did...2 pkgs cresent rolls.  I tore each triangle into 3 equal pieces, formed into a ball and rolled into sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I did change up sugar to 1/4 C brown and 1/2 cup white.  Turned out great.  Needed to bake at 350 for 40 - 45 min.

This recipe if fun and easy to make. I used a pizza cutter to quarter the buscuits and it worked like a charm! I also added walnuts and raisans throughout. It comes out of the pan looking great and tastes even better!

This is always a huge hit.  I use a whole 4 pk of biscuits, and shake them into the cinnamon sugar in a gallon plastic bag, a handful at a time.  I don't put all the cinnamon in at once, because it clings to the first few.

Yum!!! This makes an excellent quick breakfast! I did change it up a bit by melting the butter with brown sugar instead of white sugar though. Also I could not find my bundt pan, so I used a muffin tin and baked them for about 10 -15 mins and then drizzled with powdered sugar icing, these were just like the cinnamon melts at McDonalds, but better!!!

The outside ended up too hard and well done by the time the inside was cooked.  I think I will use 2 tubes of biscuits instead of 3 next time.

You can use a 5-biscuit can of buttermilk biscuits and a miniature pan or very small casserole dish for two-servings.   My husband and I made it this way the other night so that we wouldn't eat the entire bundt pan (it's happened before).

This is a really good basic recipe! I added a handfull of raisins and 1/2 c. choped peacans. Also for a little more flavor I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of allspice. Very good my husband cannot get enough of it!

This is a great one to do with the kids.  They really love it and it's an easy recipe for them to follow.  I added icing to the top - confectioner's sugar, a little bit of hot water, and a few drops of orange extract for a little "twang".  Kids can do this part too - a great sense of accomplishment for them!

Oh so very very good!!  Love this!  The only thing I would have changed in what I did was to buy plain biscuits and not the "butter" flavored.  Since the recipe calls for a butter glaze it was a bit much butter.  Still delicious though. I added the powdered sugar frosting that the recipe suggest and thought it was a great addition.  Will definately make again!!

I really loved this it was easy and everyone loved it... I used brown sugar with the butter instead of white sugar, I also put chooped nuts at the bottom of pan before putting in the biscuits. I also used a vanilla glaze over top. It was very yummy!!!

Honestly, when I tasted this I thought it was just OK. It was good, but not so good that I couldn't stop eating it and definitely not as good as my mom used to make (I'd never made it on my own until now). But I made it for a company lunch and people have been emailing me and stopping me in the halls for two weeks now telling me how delicious it was - including people who have never talked to me before. So apparently most people like it!

I did change it a little bit. I didn't use nearly as much of the sugar mixture as the recipe called for, even though I coated all my biscuit pieces as much as I possibly could. So I used the leftover sugar mixture for the glaze on top, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar to that, too.

This is a great recipe!!!  I thought it was very simple and yummy.  I used a pizza cutter to cut biscuits in quarters in stead of sissors and it worked great-- no dipping in water and made prep time a snap!!! Will make this again and again. Thanks

Fabulous and easy. I added 3/4 cup of raisins,  an handful of chopped walnuts, and apple pie filling (1/2 cup or so). This was amazing, everyone at work couldn't stop munching on it. Definitely a keeper!

This is the tastiest bread we have ever had!  It is easy enough to have kids help prepare it, just make sure you cook it long enough, so it isn't uncooked in the center.

GREAT!!! The only thing I changed was I didn't add the extra sugar.  I just used what I had left over from coating the bisquits.  Big hit with my girl friends. Served with pigs in a blanket, fresh fruit, coffee & juice.  We were leaving for a girls only weekend to the beach and I had this all ready when they arrived at 6:00 am.  They couldn't believe something so good and pretty, could be so easy to make.  They all gave me a "WOO HOO".

I usually double the recipe--keeping one and giving the other as a treat. I use 2 bread pans. The only change I have made is using the left-over sugar mixture from step 2 in step 3. Once cooled, I top with Vanilla Glaze--also found on the website.

Excellent tasting - reminds me of the monkey bread that I used to get a long time ago from an old girl friend of mine.  I'll definitely make this again, and wouldn't change anything.

I love this recipe.  Whenever I make it I throw together a fast icing of confectioner's sugar, milk, and vanilla (about one cup sugar, 2 tbls milk and 1 tsp vanilla, add more or less to taste and depending on how much you want to make).  It's a thin, sweet icing that goes well with the bread.  Next time I'm going to make the pieces a little larger and try stuffing some with cream cheese, butterscotch chips, and chocolate chips, I think it will add a nice surprise when you bite in.

This is good, but I put chopped walnuts in the bottom of the pan first, then when it's baked and you turn it over for serving, it looks and tastes great.

I had never made/eaten monkey bread before. It was good, but a little too sweet for me. My kids loved it though ! It has a very good taste, but just a once in awhile treat though. Will make it again, very easy, and inexpensive to make which is always good. Enjoyed it, Thanks

Hands down best monkey bread I've ever made! I messed up and threw brown sugar in the ziplock bag so I just tossed in some white sugar, added the cinnamon and because I had too much I put half of it in a bowl for the next batch I'll make later.  Used Pillsbury Buttermilk Grands (2 cans) because irs what I had here. I layered the sauce and the pecans between the tiers of biscuits. I cooked it for 30 minutes. Last 15 minutes in the oven I covered the pan with aluminum foil, and I put the bundt pan on a cookie sheet to prevent overflowing onto the oven floor. It's phenomenal! Husband isn't a fan of monkey bread but he loved this.

Didn't really care for this recipe.  It was ok, but not great.  It seemed to me that the short cut of using pre-made canned biscuits compromised the potential texture and flavor of the dish.  I will probably suck it up and try one of the from-scratch recipes if i ever want monkey bread again.

SO DELIECIOUS!!!! I love sugar and I love bread, so i knew i just HAD to try this... I recommend using real butter instead of margarine, but other than that the recipe is perfect as it is, NO CHANGES NECESSARY. My family could not wait to eat this, and it was gone in 30 minutes. Im planning to make it again for my brother's golf tournament. Try it with chocolate chips!

This is the recipe I've always made. But I will say one thing there is no need in cutting the dough. I just pull it apart with my hands and roll it in the sugar mixture. Just make sure you wash your hands before ;) Also I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the butter topping. Yummmmmy!

I suggest that wetting the scissors while you cut the biscuits not only prevents sticking, but makes a moister product.  I now dampen all sides of the biscuit with my wet fingers so that the sugar-cinnamon mix sticks better and the syrup forms more easily. Now I get perfect sticky-ness.

This was super easy to make and very tasty. I didn't pay much attention to the measurements in the recipe in favor of just throwing it together and seeing what happened, but it turned out great both times I have made it!

I followed the directions but must have done something wrong because it would never cook inside. I kept sticking it back into the oven, but the top was burning while the inside was dough. The top parts that did cook were OK but really too sweet.

This was crazy good! I used brown sugar with the butter, instead of white sugar. I used 4 cans of biscuits too. I also glazed it with a vanilla icing. Yummm!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using brown sugar with the butter for drizzling. I was overall disappointed with this recipe. I didn't think the biscuit dough was a good choice. Next time I'll use a different dough. With the cinnamon sugar mixture, it seemed the cinnamon was the only spice to adhere to the dough. And lastely and most importantly, there just wasn't a much as much gooey-ness as I expected. I won't make this recipe again. Sorry, if a recipe requires this much re-write, then it's not worth it.

I didnt really like the taste of the biscuts, if I made it again I would make it with different dough, and it wasnt very moist.

Really good.  Easy and Fun for kids to help.  Putting the sugar and cinnamon mixture in a ziplock bag would help make it less messy.  You could also butter the dough and then put in bag if it isn't sticking as well as you liked.  Vary with other sweeteners: maple syrup, brown sugar, honey, nutmeg, etc...

This is so easy and delicious! I make one change which is to use the leftover sugar/cinnamon mix as the syrup and just add additional sugar to equal the amount called for in the recipe.

Very good bread and easy and fun to make.  My five year old loved dipping the biscuits into the cinasugar mix.  We followed the advice of others and added pecans to the butter/ brown sugar topping and it was great.  We even had a few bites left over and they still tasted great the next day!

This recipe is FABULOUS!!!  I did have to cook the bread about 20 minutes longer than called for on the recipe, but it turned out great.  My 6 yr old daughter helped me make it in its entirety, and it was very very easy and fun to do!  I will definitely make this recipe for years to come!!

so good but you have to eat right out of the oven or they get hard.  I sprinkle a bit of butterscotch pudding mix on the bottom of the bundt pan before I add the dough and made with real butter helps the brown sugar to carmelize...family loves it

Wow, these are so good!  Made this with my own bread dough and followed suggestions.  I've learned that with cinnamon rolls or this recipe, the trick it to have enough butter to make a runny sauce for the sugars.  If you don't have enough, it will turn out hard and crunchy caramel.  So if you want lower fat, then cut back sugars and butter.  Otherwise, be generous on the butter!  I love the brown sugar with the sugar though, that is what gives it the caramel flavor when the sugars cook.

Great! Used a bit of brown sugar, but that's pretty much the only thing I changed. I didn't have a bunt pan, so I used a foil deep round casserole pan and put a foil " cilindar" in the center so it was like a bunt pan... I think it prevented it from cooking as well in the middle (Fine by me). I made sure it sat at least an hour or so before I flipped it over. Everyone loved it!

I am teaching my kids how to cook and we decided to try this recipe. It was super kid friendly and easy. Turned out beautiful and tasted yummy! We made it exactly except we had two different kinds of biscuits on hand - wheat and a flaky butter.  Still turned out great!

I made this monkey bread for my dad's birthday and he loved it (as did everyone else). I thought this recipe looked good and it suuuure was.  I used those cans of refrigerated biscuit dough - the kind that pop when you open them!  I had a lot of fun cutting them into random shapes and then putting them together like I was making a stone wall.  If you think of it like that, it's really easy!

I like monkey bread but not this recipe.  I would change it to rolling the bolls in melted butter first, then the cinnamon/sugar mix.  And then pour the remainder of the mix on top with no added extra white sugar.  This recipe was  both too sweet and too buttery.

I have made monkey bread before but have always made my own dough.  I decided to make this at the last minute so I went the refrigerated biscuit dough route.  It was really pretty good.   I used less white sugar and less cinnamon, putting the mixture in a plastic bag and shaking the cut biscuits in it.  For the sauce I used butter and only Â½ cup brown sugar and 1 Tablespoon cinnamon.  I was surprised how well this turned out and monkey bread is always a hit with kids and teens.

I had my doubts when I tried this.  15 minutes after it came out of the oven, it was GONE.  The kids and husband inhaled this and we are not big on refrigerated bread in cans.  Very easy and something the kids can do.

Excellent recipe! Quick, fun and super easy to put together. Great to do with children and grandchildren. However, do not over bake. My last batch turned out hard and dry but that was my fought for leaving it in the oven too long. As some other reviewers, I too used brown sugar rather then white. Great way to warm up the house with yummy aromas on a cold winter's night.

I made this for my 15 year old step-son one morning before school. He loved it. I did leave out the nuts and the raisins.
I baked it at 325 for about 20 minutes because I have a convection oven. I will need to cook it just a tad bit longer to make sure the middle is done. I did use a bundt pan like someone suggested as not to have a treacherous accident. Thanks for submitting. Will make again.

This was a huge hit. I made this recipe using Splenda and my family didn't miss the sugar. It was nice to make this dessert for my diabetic grandpa.

Very dry, edible once the top layer is removed.  Not syrupy/gooey at all as one might like.

Very good, i made this for christmas morning and my husband wants to make it a tradition. I only used two cans of biscuts and adjusted the other ingredients then used a 9x5 bread loaf pan because I couldn't find my bundt pan, the middle was a little underdone but still edible but that I'm sure is because of the pan.

Even better when you put alittle cube of cream cheese inside the biscuit and seal. Then do the sugar/cinnamon thing.

I followed another's advice and used a pizza cutter to cut dough. Excellent idea. It only took me minutes to cut and coat all the dough. I had a little bit of trouble with the melted butter with the sugar. My sugar didn't melt very well. But I can almost guarantee that's I messed up. I'm still learning.

YUM!  Made this on a night when we had all our kids home at one time (all 4 of them) and it was gone about 30 minutes after it came out of the oven.  A little time consuming with getting all the biscuit pieces covered in the cinnamon sugar, but think of all the calories you burn while making it!!  Probably almost enough to justify that 2nd serving...

This is a very good and easy recipe, although the prep time for me is a lot more than 5 minutes.   When I make it, I layer the biscuits and the butter . . . I put half the biscuits, half the butter, the rest of the biscuits, and then the rest of the butter.  It tastes a lot like cinnamon rolls, but is definitely less work.  I drizzle a cream cheese icing over it to really make it taste like a cinnamon roll.  Great!

Very good.  I think that the butter/sugar mixture you pour on top should be increased and maybe added to the bread in layers when putting in the pan.  I added pecans which was tasty.  All in all, very good.

Very good but too sweet even as a dessert.  Next time I will add the butter to the remaining cinnamon/sugar mix and completely eliminate the rest of the sugar.  I did, however, use the icing that came with the cinnamon biscuits which probably added quite a bit to the sweetness.

Pillsbury has come out with â€˜sweet biscuits.â€™  I changed up the recipe with using one can of chocolate chip and one can of blueberry.  I also used one can of cinnamon roll. I set the icings aside that each came with. I used a butter spray to grease my Bundt pan.

Recipe as written is great, but makes a LOT.  If you, like us, are a smaller family, it easily cuts into thirds.  I have even used a 5 ct tube of biscuits and adjusted all other ingredients for just hubs and I.   Adjust your cooking time and your golden - no pun intended!

Used real biscuit dough and it was ok , needs tweaking. More sauce for sure and the dough needs more flavor (the biscuit recipe used is good).

Iâ€™ve found this recipe works great if you reduce the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons. I also skip the additional 3/4 cup of sugar. Instead, after dipping the dough in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, I mix whatever is left of the cinnamon sugar with the stick of melted butter.

Followed the directions exactly, except for a bundt pan instead of a loaf pan.  This was really easy and turned out fantastic.  My husband liked this one because it's not too sweet.  I will certainly make this one again.  I would recommend that you reduce the amount of sugar and cinnamon used to roll the dough in; I had at least a half cup of the mixture left after I finished putting the bread together.

the recipe was great. Instead of using the walnuts, I added mini chocolate chips and rolled the biscuit quarters into balls in order to stuff more chocolate chips inside.

I did not make any changes, but I suggest in this cold weather once it cools off from the oven eating it right away while it is warm and enjoying it as you grab pieces from the cake it is delicious!

I added the butter/sugar mixture to the middle as well so it was moist and yummy all the way through.

This was the first time I'd made Monkey Bread. I wasn't sure my husband would like it (he's not much for sweets), but he ate more than me. He loved it. I'm going to make more this weekend.  I did notice that the butter/sugar mixture didn't really coat the bread so it wasn't gooey. The next time I'm going to use more butter and I'm going to reduce the baking time to 30 minutes.

The only change I made was using 2 16oz tubes of biscuit dough due to not finding 10 oz ones.  I think I need to mix the glaze better next time as it came out thicker and formed more of an icing layer over the top than a glaze but it still tasted great!

This was very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and used Buttermilk Grand biscuits.  I recommend mixing the 3/4 cup sugar with cinnamon and after coating the biscuits, dump the rest over them in the pan.  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar with the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and melted that in one cup of butter and poured that over the top before baking.

I've made this for years, and every time those who tried it loved it. I make three small changes and additions: I use some brown sugar in the sauce mixture; add some maple syrup in the sauce mixture; and as I'm layering the dough, I sprinkle in white chocolate chips throughout.

Better when its warm.  Had to cook mine another 10 min. It was doughy under first layer. After cooking a second time I left it in oven while oven cooled down, then it was actually cooked.
Second day kind of dry.

Very easy.  Get every thing set up ahead and use a  zip top bag for the cinnamon sugar.  Just drop a few pieces in and shake gently.  Use tongs to get them out.    I usually have all the ingredients on hand so it can be a spare of the moment creation.  We love pecans or walnuts in ours.    Been making this for years.

Relatively a quick and easy recipe. I added cranberries instead of raisins and walnuts. What I'd do differently is increase the butter/brown sugar mixture so the whole dessert is covered once it's on the plate. The bottom was dried out. It was a hit at work anyway!

I made recipe exactly as is. Am I only one who had the butter and sugar mixture leak out of bundt pan?? Had that not happened, I think it would have been better - middle pieces didn't have much flavor bc it seemed like it all leaked out. Also, top was kind of hard and I had to cook it long enough for inside to be done.

I have to give it a 5 Star
I made my first Monkey Bread ever for a pot luck at my senior center.  There was nothing but a clean plate to take home.  I thought it tasted great, was inexpensive, and easy to make. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I purchased two cans of biscuits (8 each) rather than the three (5 each).  I had a lot of dipping sugar/cinnamon mix left over so I guess I will be making it again soon.
One thing I did  differently, I used a chef knife and a cutting mat to quarter the biscuits and didn't have any trouble or need any water.

This is the perfect baking to do with two grandchildren (the little monkeys) coming to Grandma and Grandpa's for a sleepover.  The six year old girl and her 4 year old brother loved coating the biscuit quarters with water then the cinnamon sugar mixture.  by the time their parents came to pick them up we had a warm bundt cake ring of monkey bread.  The children were proud and the monkey bread bits tasted as good as any cinnamon bun I have ever had.

I absolutely loved it. I mixed in 1/4 c of  brown sugar and only 1/2 c granulated with the melted butter.  Then once it was done I melted 1/4c butter with sugar & dash of cinnamon to pour over the top after it cooled. I will DEFINITELY make it again!!! Thank you for sharing such a simple yet awesome recipe

Excellent, rich and easy to make. Great as a desert with icecream and a cup of coffee.

Wouldn't bother to make it again. Though it was easy to put together, it was overly done on the top and bottom and under done in the middle.

Used butter instead of  margarine because I was out of smart balance which I prefer to use. Prep time was way more than 5 minutes.

I have made this for years but instead of dipping in water and pouring the butter over the whole thing and then add more sugar, I dip each piece of dough in the melted butter, then roll in sugar cinnamon mixture and place in pan.  It turns out moist and sugary but not over the top sweet.

This was okay, but not really monkey bread. I've been making real monkey bread for years and it's much better than this. One of the best things about monkey bread is the yeast flavor. There was no yeast flavor in this at all.

Swapped out half of the sugar for brown sugar and cooked for a little bit shorter time. I might even try covering it with foil next time to keep it more moist.

i used cinnamon and brown sugar honey butter instead. and cut down the recipe and made 2 personal sized ones in a 2 cup round glass dish where i only used one package of dough. . the sugar and butter mixture made a chewy caramel which gave a nice crunch. i also cut down the cooking time to 20 minutes and it came out a little dark on top because the poured on mixture and it was a little tough to get out... had to scrape the side

This sounded delicious but was way dry.  I grew up with monkey bread being gooey and delicious.  It was just biscuits rolled in cinnamon and sugar. I would recommend either adding more butter in layers or rolling pieces in butter before adding cinnamon and sugar.

Tasty. My kids loved making these. Next time, I would like to add the butter/sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan so when you turn it over, the glaze is on top. Not sure if this will work but its worth the try.

SOOO good! I think I just burnt off every taste bud on my tongue eating them within 30 seconds of coming out of the oven. 
I only used 2 cans of biscuits, since that's all I had. I cut each biscuit into quarters and rolled them in melted butter before rolling them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. They turned out great, just like something I made when I was a kid!

This turn out to be exactly what I remember growing up. My children devoured this recipe within hours. And it was simple enough that my daughter could help with it. The only thing I changed was adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture to the melted butter and topping it that way instead of just sugar.

At this temperature they were too crispy for us. The husband still ate it but had to dig it out of the pan (the caramelizing process didn't work like it ought to and it glued it to the inside of the pan.) I made this exactly as written, no substitutions or additions.

Love these!  Reminds me of my childhood staying at my aunt's house!  I have now started this tradition with my niece and nephew when they come to stay.  My only change is to add in a bit of vanilla to the topping.

Warning!! Make this recipe when you have gobs of company at your house.  My family ate a respectable piece each, then I ate so much I had to unceremoniously put the leftovers in the garbage disposal.  It's far too delicious to be left alone with me.

My pan seemed a little small so after quartering 8 grands biscuits I switched to a can of 10 smaller biscuits (and halved those.) I only used 3 tsps of cinnamon as 3TBS seemed too much and they were delicious! For the topping I used 1/4 C. unsalted butter and 1/4 C. brown sugar. Cooked for 30 minutes and they were perfect. Slid right out of the pan and was beautiful. Next time I will use half of the coating mixture, there was far too much AND place a cookie sheet underneath to catch the sugar topping if it boils over. I will definitely make this again. It was so easy!

I give it 5 stars after I made the following changes.  I added 1/4 stick more butter for melting.  I cut back on the white sugar that was to be melted with the butter and used the enormous amount of cinnamon sugar I had left and dumped that into the melted butter. The 1/4 stick more butter was melted and poured on top of all to soak each and every piece of biscuit.

Made this recipe with 1 "Grands" tin (16oz) and in a round 8" cake pan, well greased. Cut each biscuit in 6 pieces instead of 4. Used as pizza cutter. Great idea, no water needed. 
Baked for 20 mins and they were perfect. I brought it to the neighbor's house and it was gone within 4 minutes. AND the kids didn't even get any!

This is so addictive! I followed Sumchelle's suggestions and this came out really great. I'd never had this before, but made it for my husband who said this was a childhood favorite. He loved it, but thought the pieces should be smaller (picky  picky). We dipped the monkey bread in homemade icing (powedered sugar + heavy cream) and couldn't stop eating... :-)

Absolutely wonderful! I've made this a countless number of times! My family loves it! It's so easy to make. I added pecans and that gave it an extra crunch. You can't go wrong with it. It's that easy.

YUM!  This was so good!  I halved the recipe since all I had was one regular 10.2 oz can of biscuits and one smaller 4.5 oz can.  I baked the bread in a 9x5 inch loaf pan for about 22 minutes and it was just perfect.  I also used brown sugar for the topping like some other reviewers suggested.  Also, for easier prep, just put the sugar and cinnamon mixture in a large ziploc bag and then place the biscuit pieces in the bag, seal it up, and shake to coat.  Much simpler!  A quick, easy, and delicious breakfast.  I'll definitely be saving this recipe!

Great recipe. Used to make it as a kid. Did swap brown sugar for white and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the heated mixture just before pouring into the pan. Yummy!

We had some biscuits in the fridge that hadn't been used but we're Pillsbury Buttery kind. We also had a tube of the Buttermilk kind. I think that the favor would have been so much better if the buttery kind had not been used. Next time we will definitely stick to only using buttermilk. The dough also didn't get done all the way through, but I don't think that was the recipes fault. Thanks for a great recipe! We'll try this one again!

Very tasty!!!  I made this the first time on Christmas morning; everyone loved it, and had seconds.  I did add pecans and some apple slices, but I'm sure it would be just as good as-is.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time, I might try adding a few raisins.  :)

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT! I just took it out the oven and let it cool off so me and my kids are sitting here devouring it!  I followed the recipe exactly but took it out the oven after about 20 mins or so though. I did end up adding more butter on it also.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I used to make it with my mom, and my kids really enjoyed making it with me last night! Only change I made was to sprinkle some of the cinnamon/sugar mix over the top before adding the butter, in place of the extra 3/4 cup of white sugar. Everyone here just ate it up.

I made homemade biscuit dough because I don't care for the taste of the "pop and serve" can  sold at stores. I had to bake it for an hour which was fine but I had to add more butter (1.5 times what is needed) so it wouldn't be too dry. It tasted fantastic, it just needed some adjustments.

This is our Christmas morning breakfast.  It's a special treat.  We call it a "Cinnamon Pull Apart".  I melt the butter first then coat the pieces in the cinnamon sugar mix then assemble.

This is what I make when I find myself with a lot of coupons for cans of biscuit dough, the biscuit dough is on sale and I feel like it's too good of a deal to pass up.  One time, between the coupons and the sale, I got 3 cans for free!  Monkey bread for everyone!  My kids think they've gone to heaven when they wake up to monkey break on a Saturday morning!

This is so easy! It's so much cheaper than the store bought Monkey Bread, I will never buy it again. My hubby and kids ate this up and loved it. The only thing I changed was I melted butter and brown sugar together and poured it on top. Sooo good and sure to satisfy any sweet craving.

I use a recipe almost exactly like this one.  Mine uses four tubes of dough.  The quartered biscuits are dipped in a mixture of 3/4 c. sugar and 1 T cinnamon.  Then bring 1 c. sugar, 3/4 c. margarine and 1.5 T cinnamon to a rolling boil on the stove and pour mixture over biscuits.  Bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  You can use either a Bundt pan or an angel food cake pan.  If you use an angel food cake pan you must put a cookie sheet under it because the butter mixture will leak all over your oven.  If you can, use a Bundt pan because not only will it save your oven, you won't lose all that wonderful gooey sauce!

I gave this recipe 4 stars bc I modified it ... ALTHOUGH I loved it! I used 1 cup of brown sugar (NO white sugar at all) and added a handful of raisins! This was so much fun for me and my 5 year old to make! we also gobbled it gone, will make again!

This was awesome monkey bread! We served it for my daughter's 13th birthday party sleepover.  Made two and they were totally eaten!  We will make this again, for sure!

Almost as good as my Mom's...it wasn't as light and fluffy as I remember.  But that is probably my fault.  I was trying to cook Christmas dinner at the same time! :)

Very easy to make. I split the recipe into two bread pans. In one I put a small amount of cream cheese into the ceter of each piece of dough and the other I followed the original recipe. Both turned out great.

I have seen many versions of this recipe and they are all pretty much the same.  It would be difficult to mess this recipie up.  The combination of butter, sugar, cinnimon and bisquits always makes it a hit.  I always make this for brunch at the in-laws and it's always gone.  If you want to make it even more sinfully delicious you can first add walnuts and chocolate chips to the pan before adding the bisquits.  Yummy!

I give it two stars for easy.  It's probably only good warm.  By the time I served it (at book group), it had cooled.  Cinnamon toast would have been better.

This is great! I do fix a separate pan for dd with no butter, otherwise there's no change and these never last at my house.  They are a regular request!

Turned out very good.  This would be great with a cup of coffee.  Will use it again.  Maybe next time will add an icing glaze for the top.

We loved this recipe..I had been looking for it and found it here.  The only thing I would change is to put the butter/sugar mixture in layers as others suggested..there was too much only in one place and would be beter through out.

BIG hit at a recent party I attended!  I felt guilty accepting compliments because this was so easy to make!  I tried it once before with a different pan, and folks, don't mess around - use a tube pan for 3 rolls of biscuit dough.  I might experiment next time with chopped pecans or raisins, but that's a personal decision every monkey bread maker has to make for herself.  Two sticky thumbs up!!
