Pretty Easy Chili Haiku: "Love whole tomatoes! Squish'em with my hands, such fun! Subbed broth for the beer." My daughters loved dumping the measured ingredients into the crockpot, along with breaking up the tomatoes. I guess I've grown accustomed to using canned diced tomatoes in chilis that this was unexpected! Took cook's note and instead of water, used chicken broth for the beer. This was a pretty good chili, but alas, the Italian Seasoning was a bit much - next time around, I would halve if not quarter how much of it goes in.

I thought this was good, but next time I will reduce the Italian seasoning by half, as it somewhat overpowered the rest of flavors. I may also reduce the sugar by half as the chili was a little too sweet for my liking. My house sure did smell good when I got home from work, and it was nice to have dinner ready and waiting.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yes, easy and great tasting. Did not add the Italian seasoning though.
