This was a fantastic recipe, but the first step of effectively blanching the cauliflower in cumin scented water is totally unnecessary.  The florets cook to perfection when just dipped in the batter and fried - also, the batter sticks more easily to the uncooked pieces.  Want to save more time? The use of the food processor to make the batter is overkill as far as dishes and equipment go (or maybe I am just lazy).  Just whip it up in a bowl (the same one you will use to dip the florets in).  So save yourself the hassle of step 1 and part of step 2 and make this tasty recipe.

I love this recipe! I normally steam the cauliflower and just pan fry, but this was nice for a change.  I served it as an appetizer with a dip that I make from low fat sour cream, cumin and olive oil. Thanks!

Excellent flavor. Needed to use more than 1/4 cup of milk to make the batter less dough-like and more batter-like.  If you want the fried cauliflower to be crunchier, then add cornmeal to the batter. Great recipe! Thanks!

I microwaved fresh florets for three minutes with a little water and some cumin. Mixed the batter by hand, adding extra milk to make a thick pancake-batter consistency. I added some cayenne, Mrs. Dash's lemon-garlic seasoning, and garlic powder. Deep fried florets for two minutes at 350, drained on paper towels and salted. Served with ranch dip. Delicious! You won my son over to eating cauliflower!

Blending all the ingredients together wasn't the best idea...the batter was too runny...and when I added more flour...it was clumpy!
I had to result to starting from scratch. I placed the flour in a separate bowl....then, I placed the eggs and milk in another bowl. I dipped the cauliflower into the wet mixture and coated them into the dry mixture....Done deal!!

Eliminated step one as suggested.  I used 1 tablespoon tomato powder instead of paste, put in 2 tsp of cumin (instead of 1), 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp of salt into the batter. Adding enough milk for a thick batter (bit more then cake like).   Just hand whisked the batter in a small bowl.  Fried them in coconut oil. Beautiful color, just a bit snappy on the inside for a nice crunch, great flavor. Def. a winner with the kids.

I just made this recipe and I love it! It's hard to get my vegatarian brother to eat anything, but with this, I had to slap his hands away from the dish. Will definitely be making this one again

This was super easy and delicious - served with a Greek yogurt ranch dip. As another reviewer suggested, I substituted 1/2 the flour for corn meal to provide a bit of crunch. Added tandoori spice and was amazing

Turned out great! I recommend a little more tomato paste than called for. Also, one time I added some sour cream to make the consistency a little creamier; turned out really good! Definitely smaller pieces makes for tastier result! I used peanut oil for deep frying. Best to add lots of salt to mixture instead of just salting the finished product. Doesn't flavor it very well that way

Excellent. I made way too much and gave the excess to my neighbor. Now they want me to make it again! Big Hit with any dipping sauce you like or none at all.

This recipe was really different from what I normally do and it was a great change.  I found that the batter was a little bland for me and I needed a lot more than 1/4 cup of milk.  Maybe if I added cornmeal like NINhalos suggested or if you use dip it would come out perfect.

This was so much better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant!  I followed directions exactly except for the milk...  I just added the milk slowly while stirring the rest of the ingredients until the batter seemed to have the the right consistency.  Will make this again and again and again.

This was great! Really easy to make too. I followed the instructions exactly besides the blender part. I just mixed it by hand and used powdered garlic. I had to use more milk, probably because I didnt blend it, and just added the milk until it was almost like a very thick pancake batter. I just threw the cauliflower in a bowl with the batter and fried it in 2 batches. Came out great! Thanks! I might fry it a TINY bit longer next time just to add a little extra crunch. But, overall, delish!

I steamed the cauliflower with cumin in the microwave, as suggested in other posts, mixed the batter in my mini-processor and used sour milk to thin it to batter. Needed about 3/4 cup. Instead of dipping the cauliflower, I poured the batter over it in the bowl it had been "nuked" in, and tossed to coat. Oh, and I used 1/2 a cup each of corn flour and all-purpose wheat flour, and some extra cumin. Delicious!
