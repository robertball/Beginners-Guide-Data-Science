These cookies are great.  I had to do a report on Norway and make a food that goes the country.  Every one in my class loved them.

This is a recipe that I have been making at Holiday time for over 25 years, I use the star mold with the cookie press and drip red raspberry jam into the middle immediately when they come out of the oven, but any bright jam will do fine.    Wonderful!

Excellent Recipe.  Easy to make.  To make it worth my while using a cookie press, you should at least double if not triple the recipe!!  Yummy!!

It's REALLY important to press the cooked yolks through a fine sieve before beating them with the butter, etc. Never an egg-y taste or texture. I've been making these for over 40 years.I've used a cookie press,or made them into balls & rolled in sprinkles, or chop't nuts, or sugar, etc, or pressed  the balls with my thumbprint and filled with jam, colored sprinkles, a  choc. kiss, or Nutella. And a  dab of food coloring paste will tint them well. These are wonderful, and you can make many variations. Also, the dough AND the cookies  freeze very well; just don't pack them too tightly or they'll crumble (...but then you can use the cookie crumbs for a parfait, with ice cream or pudding! )  
Don't miss out- these are the easiest and most popular cookies I make. Also, they're delicate enough to make for a shower, etc. I've made little blue and/or pink ones for showers, and small pink heart cookie press ones for Valentine's Day.

This was my first time using a cookie press and this dough was excellent. I made 3 batches and added 1/4 cup of almond butter to one, 2 tsp of lemon zest to another, and 2 tbs of cocoa to the third. This recipe made equally excellent almond, lemon and cocoa shortbread. Tasty, easy to make and work with.

I've made these cookies for many years.  What I do is I roll out the dough and use Christmas cookie cutters, then use the crystal sprinkles on them.  Yum!

so easy to make! i was surprised you had to hard boil the eggs, so it made me def want to try the recipe. they came out perfect, a lovely golden brown. i greased the cookie sheet with a layer of butter and sprinkled sugar on it. it tastes alot better than using pam or another type of spray greaser. mine only complaint is that they came out slightly dry. not terribly but i wonder what i could do next time to prevent the dryness! i suppose practice will make perfect!   happy cooking xx

Good, quick cookie to satisfy the sweet tooth.  We ate them them with chocolate pudding, but found that they were good just by themselves.  It's definitely a keeper!

Very quick and easy to make. Doesn't use many ingredients so you really don't need to buy anything in advance. Everybody loves it, it could also be decorated with some kind of fruit to make it have more taste.

These cookies were a hit at a Haloween party I attended.  Once people ate one, they went back for more; One person couldn't stop talking how goog they were.  They were very easy to make with the press and it was my first time using a press, so if I can us one, anyone can.

These cookies are similar to Nabisco's Butter Cookies, but are softer and melt right in your mouth. The only change I made was baking them for a little under 10 minutes to prevent the bottom from burning. The dough was easy to work with. My father said it reminded him of his grandmother's cookies. Success!

Wow these are great.  Made a "well" in each cookie and added some jelly before I baked them.  Didn't last very long in this house. Next time will double the recipe.  Thanks for the keeper

They came out PERFECTLY, my family couldn't get enough of the melt in your mouth loveliness.
My mother said it reminded her of what her great-aunt used to make, she especially loved them.
 I must say, I will be using this recipe quite often.

Super simple. Dough a little mushy to me. Had to flour 3 times just to get them spread to cut out. Very bland like shortbread. My Honey woke up and ate them with milk & really liked them.

These cookies are keepers. Nice and delicate butter cookie with an almost creamy texture. They didn't work in my cookie press so I gently rolled them out and used a cookie cutter. I rolled them to just under a centimeter thick and they turned out perfectly. :)

I was about 10 beers in on a Saturday night, when suddenly I had a sweet tooth.   A quick inventory of the kitchen told me that I had eggs, flour, sugar and butter on hand.   Found this recipe by searching for those four ingredients.   As it happened, I also had vanilla!   What luck!  So, armed only with a big bowl, a fork and a toaster oven I set forth to make these cookies.   It was incredibly difficult to "cream" the cold butter and hard-boiled eggs yolks with a mere fork, but I persevered.  I mixed in the flour and vanilla, stirred for a few more minutes, then popped 'em on a cookie sheet in roundish blobs.   I baked at 375 for maybe 13 minutes.   Sprinkled a little sugar over the batch, and let 'em cool for about 55 seconds (yeah, I'm patient).   OMG, they were delicious!   They tasted like those Danish butter cookies you get in the blue tins, only HOT and SOFT and seductively FRAGRANT.  I think some of the credit has to go the butter.   I used Finlandia, which has a rich, sweet taste.   I'll be making these again.  :D

This cookie was exactly the kind that a real Norwegian would love: small and tasty, round but not too sweet in flavor. They were so delicious it was hard not to just eat them right off the hot cookie sheet. I'm more partial to a sweeter, less buttery cookie but they are excellent with a little fruity jam, as suggested by previous reviewers. Thanks for this great authentic recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  Loved these cookies.  I was looking for new ideas for my families Christmas cookie day and thought I'd try this.  They were sort of crumbly but maybe that was due to me using a gluten free flour blend.  I won't make these for the Christmas cookies day because I don't think that they would freeze very well due to the fact that they are so delicate, but will definitely make them again for everyday.

For a good flavor variation, I add lemon extract. Although this recipe doesnt call for pressing the egg yolks through a sieve, I agree that this is an important step. I have been making this recipe for over 40 years. My family loves these cookies! Using a cookie press and different colors of food coloring make these cookies a real hit with kids.

dough was too thick to use in my cookie press. not sure why as other reviewers seemed to have no problem.  I added 2 tbsp of cocoa powder and some extra butter to try and soften up the dough.  I ended up making a roll and cutting it into cookies.

I didn't like these AT ALL, but that's just because I hate the taste and texture of egg yolks. Should have known, I guess! If you're not a fan of eggs yolks, this recipe is not for you. My boyfriend thought they were absolutely delicious.

Me and my grand daughter just made these cookies. I am always looking for a good sugar cookie, these are the best so far. 
I was really interested when it said add boiled egg yolk, I read it at least 3 times, I said well ok let's do this, oh my gosh how good are they, we just added sprinkles that's all they are terrific, these are a keeper we love them, light flakey,crispy,buttery goodness and if you dont tell anyone they will never know about the eggs. 
Thank you.

Yummy little shortbread style cookies. I made one batch as described and another batch with lemon zest and flavor. Both were gobbled up

Simple. Easy. I did thumb print and also pressed the balls into fun shapes with my fingers! Used raspberry jam in hole on some, others a single choc chip cookie. Great!

My curiously got the best of me when I saw boiled eggs. Made them exactly as recipe called for, except I used almond flavor.
They were so light and mouth watering..
I will make them for Christmas gifts,will have to double the recipe.

I made these in a cookie press.  The first batch expelled fine but when I attempted the second batch, the dough was too sticky to detach from the press and land on the cookie sheet.  After chilling the dough and much trial and error, I got all the cookies made.  Maybe my pan was too dark, but they went quickly from not cooked to overly brown.  Then, several cookies inexplicably broke in half after cooling.  They WERE tasty, but I will go back to the spritz cookie recipes for the press.

Delish. Followed instructions exactly. Used a teaspoon measure scooper and used my finger to scoop the dough out and made them into little balls. Then I pushed them down with my thumb.  10 min was enough with my oven.  Supper delicate and light!

I really love this recipe. After boiling the eggs, the prep time is pretty fast. I put almond extract in mine. That is the flavor we Norwegians like. I think vanilla is kind of boring.

I must have done something wrong because there cookies came out sticky, they wouldn't fall off of the cookie press... the dough was a lot like gum. The cookie texture was unfortunate.

These were really good. Best part is you can eat the batter - no raw eggs!  I beat the butter and yokes on high with my KitchenAid for a couple minutes. Added a little salt and doubled vanilla.  Will make again.

I absolutely LOVE these cookies! My family and friends always ask for them. I make them in a thumbprint style, and add different things, depending on what I have on hand. I have some in the oven as I type, with a lingonberry jam I found, and my son's mouth is watering. But they are just as tasty with an orange marmalade, or even a light cheese cake type of thing. Very versatile cookie.

I had to try this twice to get the consistency right for the dough, because it was way too dry the first time. Creaming the egg yolk with the butter with a whisk helped, rather than just using a small spatula or a spoon. I'm very happy with these cookies, and to make them a little more interesting with some tartness, I pressed my thumbprint into the centers and added just a tiny drop of Ikea's Swedish Lingonberry jam in the centers before baking. So now they're Swedish-Norwegian, but very good nonetheless!

I have this recipe of my grandmother's from the late 1800's.  I always thought it was a "family" secret recipe.  Was very suprised to find it on the internet.  I am very happy to see that others are enjoying this most wonderful Holiday cookie recipe.

These are awesome! They are SO tender and buttery. They make me drool. I needed a cookie to use with some detailed push on cookie cutters from Williams Sonoma. I used salted butter and added an extra 1/4 tsp of salt because I have to use powdered sugar to get them to come out of the cookie cutters. I also intend to decorate them with icing. These hold their shape fairly well in spite of all of the fat. Yes, you do need to push the egg yolks thru a sieve or you will have yolk bits through out the dough. I used half a tsp of finey grated lemon zest which was very nice too. Could possibly see experimenting adding a little cocoa powder for a variation. Highly recommend these. Don't know why more people haven't tried them.
