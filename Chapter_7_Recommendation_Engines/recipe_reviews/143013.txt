This was my first time working with Phyllo and I had great success.  The filling was absolutely delicious.  I did do one thing differently.  I did not use the oil, only the butter. 
 Try dipping the turnovers in Siracha.  It is delicious.
Also, I did freeze some filling and made more turovers a couple of weeks later with very good results.

Could phyllo cups be used as well? I picture the filling within the cup, baked and topped grated cheese and fresh dill.. thoughts anyone?

**Update**
So i made this appetizer and it was sooo yummy. The only thing I would change in the recipe is to reduce the salt some. I used half and half instead as I ran out of milk, and used red bell pepper rather than green, for mor color variation. I also used the frozen phyllo cups and topped with parmesan... beautiful and much easier that working with phyllo sheets. This will be a keeper! As many suggested, this also makes a great pasta dish and/or dip.

I made these and thought they were good, but like everyone else, they really need some kick in the filling and also a dipping sauce. Also, forget the phyllo dough. Just use wonton wrappers - so much easier to use and you can find them in just about any grocery store next to packaged herbs. Next time, I think I will use more tobasco and maybe some jalapeno or another kind of chilli or hot sauce, plus a dipping sauce.

I had reservations about this at first, but this recipe was amazing.  I made this for a dinner I was invited to for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved about this.  I did leave the tabasco out as I did not have it, and will add a bit of cayenne next time.  I was a little confused about the triangle part of how to shape them but figured it out.  I also ended up only using half of the 1-pound box of phyllo sheets.  I will make another batch this week.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!

These were quite tasty - a nice addition to the Christmas dinner.  Maybe it was just me, but these took much longer to make than the 40 minutes prep time stated...throwing my dinner 90 minutes off schedule!  I would make again, but plan on 1 1/2 to 2 hours total prep time. I found it's easier to gently dab the warm butter on the dough (to avoid ripping) and cover the pastry you are not working on with a warm, damp paper towel (to avoid cracking).  I look forward to more experiments with phyllo dough.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was okay, not bad. At first I wasn't sure about the folding methods, then I realized to fold the dough exactly like you would a 'paper football'. If you played that in school. Also, work semi-quickly to get all of the turnovers folded before the dough dries out. I was distracted for the last couple & they didn't turn out so well. You can try damp paper towels to help, but I only had some success with that. Overall, the recipe was very easy to make, the taste was good, but not exciting. It seemed to be missing some flavour, or something. Everyone said they would eat them again, but not their favourites. It did open the door to modifying the recipe with other ingredients or additions though!!!

I have never used phyllo before and even so this recipe turned out perfect.  I thought it would need a dipping sauce but they were wonderful without it, all the ingredients complimented each other so well that it dd not need sauce.  This will be made again and again, I think it would even be great on crackers!

I prepared the shrimp mixture for a party, but there was too much food, so instead I saved the shrimp mixture and tossed it with pasta the next day.  It was awesome!  It was so good I made up little containers for others to try. I will be making this again for pasta - I can't wait to try it with the phyllo though!!  It must be amazing.

I have made these twice now. Both times I could NOT stop myself from sneaking bites it as I made it....I could almost eat this with a spoon.  Phyllo, while impressive, is a pain, so the 2nd time I made the recipe, I used wonton wrappers. I also added more shrimp and hot sauce b/c some of the ladies said it needed more flavor, but others said it was fine.  Just a matter of preference.  I also think this would be good over linguini if it was thinned out a bit more with the cream...just tell me how!

many people said there was something missing-needed more flavor, more kick, etc. NOBODY suggested trying the addition of garlic in with the vegetables, and possibly bacon-then you'd have the typical ingredient basis for a Cajun dish(onions, green peppers, celery, garlic and bacon)- oh and possibly a bay leaf just sitting in the pan while you're sauteeing the veggies(and then removed). i haven't tried it  yet but will soon and will get back to you with the results. if anyone does try it with my suggestions let us all know how it worked out. thanks for the recipe

Love this recipe!! However I did not use the phyllo dough but used the prepared pastry cups and it turned ouot even better.  I made my filling the night before and used Obay seasoning on the shrimp prior to adding them to the mix and the flavor was amazing.  I found this to be a quick appetizer for the familt to much on while waiting for dinner!

Every time I make these people fall in love with them! Everyone thinks they are amazing and is always asking for the recipe. The only thing I do different is I add some Cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Even without the added spice they are excellent. 

One very big recommendation I have to to eat these with the Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce posted here on allrecipes by ycrowe. Together they are a perfect pair!

These were a hit with my family!  Pretty easy to make and quite tasty.  I even made some extras and froze them.  I just that them for a while, throw them in the oven and have them ready in a flash.

Thank you for the note to chop the shrimp! These are delicious and impressive. The only thing I did differently was in the cooking process. I cooked the shrimp with the onion/pepper mix before the rest of the ingredients. Then I added the ricotta. Finally the milk in which I had dissolved the flour. The filling actually looks pretty with the pink shrimp and I think another reviewer's suggestion to fill Phyllo cups with it would be something to try next. It would definitely show off the filling. This one is a keeper and thank you to MattyGit for all his experimenting to achieve this yummy appetizer!!

I made it per the recipe and it was excellent. I would like to experiment though, and add about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the butter to saute with vegies. We also thought of putting some Boursin cheese. I may try using three sheets of Phyllo just to compare. We are serving it again for Christmas Eve ahead of the Prime Rib!

My family loved these however I did make changes. I omitted the bell pepper since my family doesn't care for it. Also omitted ricotta, flour and salt. I used cream cheese instead. I will definitely make these again.

The recipe is great. I used olive oil instead of canola and added peppadew hot sweet chillies and 1 clove chopped garlic for taste. We loved it and recommend this as a appetizer with champagne as the preferred drink.

Delicious recipe that my mom and I just made for Christmas Eve!  We noticed if you use too much filling, it may seep out when cooking. Also, we used only one half of a phyllo dough package (they come 2 rolls to a box) and never got though all of it -maybe use too much filling though?  Yes, you want to fold this like a paper football- you could even try buttering as you fold along. I would recommend making these right before you want to serve them because they will dry out otherwise.  Overall great recipe and I'm excited to make this again!

This turned out fantastic!  Great recipe!  It was my first time with phyllo so it took me quite awhile and I used more butter then it said on the sheets of pastry.  Other then that - delish!  I froze half of them for a party this weekend, we'll see how they hold up.  Fine I'm sure!  Thanks!

Family really liked it though I did make a couple changes..fond the original to be a bit bland...I could not taste the two dashes of hot sauce. If you want to taste the hot sauce add more. I added dill and 1 clove of garlic to perk it up.

I'm sure this would be good in phyllo dough. I tried it with extra milk on penne and that was too rich.

Who knew that Phyllo and Puff Pastry were not the same thing?  Probably just me.  But the Puff Pastry worked quite nicely for this recipe.  Since Puff Pastry already has a lot of butter in it, I eliminated the step using the 1/2 c. melted butter. The only other thing I changed was to add minced garlic with the shrimp (about 1 t.)  I took these to a neighborhood cocktail party and they were a big hit.  Oh, and for those of you who want a dipping sauce, try Harry and Davids Pepper and Onion relish.  Great combo.  One word of caution, the recipe does take longer to make than indicated - allow a total of about two hours from start to finish.

This was fun to make and we really enjoyed it.  I made it twice.  The second time I added garlic powder and more ricotta and filled about a TBL.  I brought it to a friend for New Year's Eve and it complimented their dinner perfectly.

Made these yesterday for a Christmas Eve dinner. They disappeared in a heart beat. Phyllo is a pain to deal with on Christmas Eve, but well worth the effort. Inspired idea by another poster to use phyllo cups, which I had in my freezer. Would love to have a dipping sauce for them.

The flavor was fairly bland so I added extra spice and the phyllo needs to be buttered on the outside otherwise it is much too dry

I made these for my boyfriend and I, and we disagreed about this recipe.  I thought they were a little bland.  The dough and the cheese were almost indistinguishable in the mouth, and the hint of shrimp didn't provide enough additional flavor.  However, my boyfriend, who often enjoys bland, home style Midwestern and Southern foods loved this recipe.  He thought they tasted simple and fresh.

I made these Christmas Eve and everyone loved them.  They are a great appetizer.  One week later I took the recipe doubled it,(except for flour only used 2 TBL,  added 1/3 cup more milk, 8 more drops of Tabasco and served it over Angel Hair Pasta, again everyone loved it.

Overall, it was good...not great.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I think the filling needed a little more kick or a dipping sauce as some other suggested. I would make these again and add some spice or sweet kick to the filling.

I own a cafe in Alaska and I made these last spring for a Moose luncheon and they were a great success.  I did not, however, use butter brushed on them, I used butter flavored cooking spray which made this a much easier and faster way to complete.  I also use the same method for wrapping halibut bites.

Made these as directed and they came out beautifully. Didn't have green pepper so used yellow. Tasted great. Took a little practice to get the triangle right, but then all was good. I always soak a clean tea towel and wring it out to lay over the unused phyllo as I go. Also brushed with butter before baking. Soooooo good. would maybe turn the heat down 25 degrees but that is probably just my oven. Will definitely make again. Was thinking of using pasta and stuffing it with this mix. Thanks for the great recipe

I have made this a couple of times in the last month and love it. I do cut the roll of Phyllo dough into quarters. They turn out to be the exact size to make the triangles. You are also only working with a small amount at a time so they don't dry out on you.

This was my first time working with phyllo and I had a hard time with it. Once I got them thrown together, they busted open and came out a little dry. I also thought the phyllo dough was to yeastie tasting for this dish. So I came up with a different way of making them. Now my family loves them. Some of the ingredients are good but I didn't like how it was all put together and made. I'll have to post how I do it but yours gave me a good start on making mine.

Not one other person has mentioned the cook time being too high - but I cooked these at the stated 425 for less than ten min. & they were burnt and burst open!! By the time I smelled them from the patio, it was too late!!! All that hard work for nothing. I have an oven thermometer in at all times, so temp SHOULD be accurate. To be fair - I gave recipe 3 stars, though I never even go to taste one!!

This was okay. Seems to be missing something, but can't think of what. A different twist to tiriopites, but I still prefer the old fashioned Greek variety--cheese or spinach pies.

They were good, but a lot of work.  I couldn't get them to look like they were in the pictures so that's why I didn't give them 4 stars.  My husband & I loved them, but I would hesitate to make for company because they didn't come out "pretty".

I made these for a christmas party they were a hit although they could have used more flavoring.  They are very time consuming and its really hard to work with the phyllo.  I will make them again but will use cresent rolls to fill instead.

The filling is delicious! Tips: make sure to read the directions on the phyllo dough package if it's your first time using it-I learned that the hard way.  Also, make sure there is enough filling in them so you aren't getting a mouthful of phyllo dough. Enjoy!

I used Frank's Hot Sauce and also added minced garlic. Instead of the phyllo dough I used phyllo cups and baked for 10 minutes on 350 degrees.  I was able to fill 30 cups. It was a hit!

I used phillo cups instead. They were delicious! Everyone loved them. I want to try it again as shrimp poorboys.

As another reviewer suggested, I made these in mini filo cups and sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on top. I substituted red pepper for green since that was what I had. These little tidbits were delicious. Super easy using the filo cups. I baked 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  They came out dainty and  delicious.

Love this recipe - have made it a few times for different events and it's always a hit. Also found it freezes well.

Yummy! I added about a Tablespoon of creole seasoning just for an extra kick.

Try adding a couple of drops of Zatarains Liquid Crab Boil. Also, I used crawfish instead of shrimp but the Crab Boil really adds the punch in this recipe.

These were bland and tasteless.  I followed the recipe exactly and also tried stuffing them in crescent rolls which made them taste slightly better.  Won't make again.

I tried these over the holiday and we loved them. The phyllo was a little hard to work with but worth the work.

Super recipe. The dough can be super crunchy. It needs about 20 min.  It does need some kind of kick. Next time I will try that siriache sauce as a dipping addition.

The phyllo can be hard to work with, as it dries out quickly. Maybe someone has suggestions?? These are good, but very time consuming and I agree that they need more kick, or flavor of some kind.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Eve party and got rave reviews on this appetizer.  It wasn't particularly difficult to make and the filling was tasty on its own (toss it with pasta), but once you put it in the phyllo and bake it, it tastes amazing!  One thing to note--the recipe says it only makes 15 pieces so I doubled it, and now I have way too much filling left and an extra package and a half of phyllo dough.  I guess I'll be making some baklava!

These were a huge hit at our Christmas get-together.  The flavor was excellent, with the recipe prepared just as stated.
