This is one of the most perfect side dishes I have ever made.  I do what the recipe states except I do not add any basil.  While the orzo is cooking in the chicken broth I saute 8 oz of sliced mushrooms in olive oil, set aside in a bowl and then saute an entire bag, maybe 10 oz of baby spinach in olive oil for maybe 30 seconds and then when the orzo is done cooking I mix it altogether and add the parm cheese.  I make this with any meat and it is always LOVED.

Very good recipe with marvelous flavor.  I did note that I needed a 1/2 can more of chicken broth to finish cooking the orzo.  Served with Roasted Chicken and a Orange, Walnut, Gorgonzola and Mixed Greens Salad with Fresh Citrus Vinaigrette from this site.

Hubby said, "Too much cheese"--yet cleaned his plate. I thought it was SO good, and wished he WOULD have left it on his plate so I could have ate it since I only made enough for two servings. Just delicious.

This is a yummy recipe!  My husband was really impressed.  However I had two concerns...it only took about 7 minutes before all the liquid was absorbed.  Do not leave it unattended on the stove or it might scorch.  Also, this must be served immediately or it gets very clumpy and hard to spoon out of the pan.  I added a little olive oil and kept the heat on low and it helped this a bit.  Overall this is a great side dish and a big hit with the family.  I will cook it again soon.  Thanks!

easy, pretty, and delicious!  i used it as a side for salmon.  
I also added a chopped tomato and pine nuts after the broth was absorbed. 
I kept some extra chicken broth heated so that i could mix right before serving (the mix tends to dry out over time... so if you don't serve it right away, it is a good idea to have some extra broth on hand)

I loved this recipe!  I made a few changes, but I feel certain, that it would be delicious just as it is written.  I used part butter and part olive oil and I sauted minced garlic with the orzo.  I then added crushed red pepper flakes and a pinch of nutmeg and a good bit of parmesan cheese and ommited the basil.  Yummy!  I also think that for a really fast, but delicious side dish, I would made the recipe just as written, but instead of fresh basil, I would add a couple TBS of pesto!

Love, love LOVE this recipe!!! I'm so excited to have come across this one. It's such an easy recipe to prepare and the result is a restaurant quality dish that your family and friends will be impressed with. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and fresh basil and it was heavenly! Such a fantastic flavor! It tasted so good that my husband thought it was complicated and that I'd spent a lot of time on it. So happy to report that wasn't the case! Simple, yet REALLY delicious!! What more could you ask for? Did I already say that I LOVE this recipe???

I served this with Easy Focaccia from this website and a salad, and it was a perfect meal. The only things I added were about 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, because we like the extra tang. I also sprinkled extra parmesan on top and dotted it with butter.

Easy to prepare and a nice taste.  I used a whole box of orzo which was about triple the recipe.  I also used the buillion cubes/water instead of the canned broth and less cheese.  I liked the taste and it went well with fish or chicken.

I thought I bought fresh basil at the store this weekend, but somehow it didn't get home with us.  So I sprinkled in dried basil instead.  My husband really liked it, but I want to try it again with fresh basil.  I used this as a side dish.

Amazing! This dish is always perfect, whatever additions we use, and we've used everything at one time or another: chopped flavored sausage with sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms, and corn; steamed asparagus with shallots; roasted chicken with choppsed bacon, and more. We've used it with the additions above as a main dish or without any additions as a side, and it always gets rave reviews. We also like to add garlic & dried basil to the mix, and have used prepared Parmesan rather than fresh, and it still comes out beautifully. Note: Don't skip the browning step-- gives a great "multi-colored" effect along with a nuttier taste. It's an excellent base recipe. Wish I could give it more stars!!

Needed a side dish at the last minute and saw I had a small amt of orzo.  Found this, made it and loved every bite!  Thank you!

totally amazing recipe. by accident, I omitted the basil but it came out great anyway. (next time I'll try the basil though. I imagine it'll taste even better). I didn't use canned broth, I just added a cup and a half of water and a bullion cube. It absorbed the liquid pretty quickly - less than 10 minutes. I then sauteed mushrooms and spinach in garlic in separate pan and added it to the orzo. Added parmesan cheese and some garlic powder. I topped it off with some green onion. It looks and tastes awesome! Definitely don't omit the browning step. It brings out a nutty kind of flavor. I might add half romano next time to shake it up a bit. Great recipe. I would definitely make it again.

This was soooo good. As others said, serve it immediately because it will thicken up quickly as it cools. Also, it is a very flavorful side dish so I suggest serving with a basic grilled chicken or fish so the flavors aren’t competing.  UPDATE: I make this all the time and was looking for a way to use up the leftovers.  I used an ice cream scooper and add some to a bowl cold, then top with hot tomato soup, YUM.  Also, for lunch today, I drizzled some cold orzo with a little olive oil and red wine vinegar for a kinda pasta salad and it's delicious.

This recipe offers a great starting point for a one pot meal.  Add Sauted Mushrooms after the Orzo is cook and cooked chicken.  It is wonderful.  I did not have fresh basil in the house last night but I make my own Pesto and freeze in ice cube trays. I just added on ice cube of Pesto at the very end of the Orzo cooking and it was wonderful.  No leftovers in this house!

Excellent change of pace for a side dish. I made a few alterations: I sauted pressed garlic (4 cloves - but you just about can't have too much garlic in my family, so use your own judgement) in the butter first, then added the orzo. When the chicken stock came to a boil, I added the basil and let it cook with the liquid. It was a definite hit - but I do like it better with tri-color orzo!

added 3/31/05: I have made this several times since my review and just wanted to add that I now make it with cilantro instead of basil.

IMO, I didn't think this recipe was anything special.  I followed the recipe as stated and even used fresh basil from my garden.  I won't make again.

This was delicious!  I used fresh basil from my garden and freshly grated parmesan cheese. The flavors were fantastic.  Originally I was planning on grilling chicken breasts to go with this and broccoli, but my husband stopped at the grocery store and lobster was on sale - so dinner was quickly switched to lobster, spinach salads and this orzo.  We couldn't have gotten a better dinner out!

The first words out of my boyfriend's mouth (after he finished chewing of course) was "Oh my God!  This is SO good!".  Very tasty!  We tried it without the basil first, and then with it and decided that the basil definately gives it that extra but subtle "zing".  Lesson learned:  don't chop your basil until you're ready to use it.  I chopped mine about an hour earlier and it got kind of blackish.  Still tasted good though.  I think the next time I will try it with 1 tb olive oil instead of 2tb butter.  But it was a hit!!  Thanks!!!

One of my favorite recipes. Simple to make with a few ingredients, this recipe is perfect side for a week night meal.  I saute 1/2 of a chopped onion in the butter before adding the orzo.  Garlic is a nice addition as well.

I love this dish!  I've tried using orzo in other recipes, but I always come back to this one.  Since I never have fresh basil on hand, dried has always suited me just fine.  Sometimes I use olive oil to brown the orzo, and it adds a different flavor too.  YUMMY!

Unlike many easy recipes with minimal ingredients that end up tasting like something is missing, this one actually tastes amazing which is very rewarding.  The prep is very quick and easy since you can grate your cheese and chop the basil while the pasta is cooking.

The pasta tastes very creamy and nutty due to the Parmesan cheese and browning of the orzo in butter, and the flavor from the fresh basil adds a nice refreshing finish.  The prepared dish has a dense texture yet manages to look light and fluffy on the plate and fork.  I followed the recipe exactly and after 20 minutes the pasta absorbed all the broth and was cooked to a perfect consistency, slightly al dente.  

It surprises me that so many reviewers said that they make this without the basil.  The basil is not overpowering at all yet really adds a dimension of flavor and color that easily makes this recipe worthy of 5 stars.

Because the dish is so simple, it can be built upon in many ways if you wish.  I might try adding some sun-dried tomatoes next time which should pair very well with the basil.  You may want to use this as as side dish with meat as a main course, but you must make sure everything else you cook is also high quality or else the orzo with Parmesan and basil will easily steal the spotlight!

Excellent flavor! However, you will need more than 14.5 oz of chicken broth. I'm sure I used at least 1/2 cup more than that. Definitely keep an eye on it while cooking and add more broth as needed. Also, if you don't like salty food, be sure to get the low sodium chicken broth.

Has anyone considered using this as a cold side dish without the parmesan and with a bit of olive oil and some seasonings?  You could add some cooked chicken or shrimp to the mix and really have a complete meal....at lease in my opinion

This is a very good dish.  I added a little garlic to the melted butter, otherwise didn't change a thing.  It didn't take nearly as long to cook as the recipe states - more like 10 minutes.  I'm glad I checked on it because it was starting to dry out!  It was a great side dish for salmon.

This was so yummy!!! my family loved it! I will have to double the recipe next time to avoid the sad faces when it was all gone :) The only change I made was I added 1/4 cup of half and half at the end because it seemed a little dry. Excellent recipe will be used alot this summer!

This is a standby side dish at my house, especially during the summer when my basil is growing! Tonight I tossed some chopped cherry tomatoes in after the pasta was cooking, and served it chilled with grilled chicken. It's versatile and a wonderfully different accompaniment (hot or cold) to grilled food in the summer or baked in the winter!

This is like homemade Rice-A-Roni without the rice!  We don't like basil so we skipped that, instead added leftover rotisserie chicken.  This made it more of a main dish - otherwise would be a good side.

Really good! I added about 3/4 lb. of cubed, sauteed chicken breast to make it more of a main dish. My 4 year old gobbled it up as did my parmesan cheese loving husband. Give it a try!

Mediterranean Mac and Cheese is a perfect description. My 11 year old daughter made this by herself and it was a great side dish. Yes, it was fairly plain but sometimes that's what you want. I would think there would be lots of ways of changing the flavors in it if you wanted to.

WOW.  I love it!  This is how Rice a Roni should be, but much better!  The flavors of the basil, chicken stock, cheese, and orzo is wonderful.  It makes about 4-5 servings.  Thank you, I will definitely share this at parties and for our personal meals. A+!

This was my first time making Orzo, I followed the recipe to the letter, it is a keeper.  The basil really adds a nice touch and the parmesan puts it over the top. I will put this into my monthly rotation.
I served this with Italian sausage and peppers and it was a perfect balance of flavors.

Omg awesome!  I followed the recipe, I needed to add a bit more chicken stock to keep from going gummy at the end.   I added some cooked mushrooms at the end with the cheese.  This is going to be a new side dish weekly at my house.  Yummy

WONDERFUL! I made this for lunch and it was sooo good, I'm making it again tonight! I didn't have fresh basil so I added a tsp of dried basil halfway during cooking.  Shrimp or chicken would be even better served over this!  Thanks Dodie! I will make this all the time!

Terrific Recipe.  Added some spinach and drained canned tomatoes at the end of cooking, and some garlic and mushrooms at the beginning.  Pretty and added some vegetables to my meal.

Ok, did anyone else have issues with parmesan cheese not blending and getting clumpy? I used a good quality cheese but I think parmesan is too hard of a cheese for this dish. I'd like to try again with a softer, higher moisture cheese like mozzarella for a creamier texture. Maybe then the recipe could be 4 or 5 stars.

Oh my, this was delicious. I used half butter-half olive oil and freshly ground Parmesan with fresh basil and parsley. As others have suggested, I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic at the initial toasting of the orzo step. There are many ways you could play with the flavorings and end up with this beautiful, almost risotto-like texture.

This was fantastic!!! The whole family devoured this! It was a nice and easy side dish for some grilled chicken. This would be great spruced up with some sauteed veggies, but it wonderful as is. Will be adding this to our menu frequently :)

Definitely a keeper!  I cut down on the cheese (used 1/4c instead of a full 1/2c) and increased the broth a bit. Use fresh basil for the best taste. Great simple recipe for Orzo.

I tried orzo for the first time using this recipe and I'm in love with it. I added spinach, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes because I like adding vegetables to any dish. The fresh basil is very crucial to the flavor of the dish, do not omit it if you help it! I would definitely make this on a regular basis from now on.

Great recipe.  I modified it some, I only used 1 tablespoon butter and instead of chicken broth I used vegetable broth, and instead of Parmesan cheese, I used Asiago cheese that I freshly grated using a microplane zester (about 1 cup of cheese).  It was DELICIOUS!

Amazing! Instead of basil I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added half a bag of fresh baby spinach. Be careful as the orzo is quick to absorb the chicken broth. I gradually added a little water while simmering. after I added the cheese I added about 1/4 cup of water to melt the cheese a little. Then I added the fresh baby spinach and stirred it around for approximately 2 minutes until the spinach wilted. I served with Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill sauce also from this site (also amazing) and fresh roasted green beans.

We love this dish! I've never had to change any quantities and it always comes out perfect. Gotta love that! I've also made this with dried basil (1/2 tsp added while simmering) when I don't have fresh basil on hand. It still comes out pretty good, but this is one of those dishes where the fresh herb makes it perfect, so don't pass on it! Thank you for sharing this great recipe! We've enjoyed it on many occasions and it's one of my favorites. :)

Very simple. Very good. We did not have enough stock so used water. You will need to check and add water as you cook, because it will stick to the pan and set off the smoke alarm. Don't say I didn't warn you. ;) I used  olive oil instead of butter. Okay, okay, I added a smidge of butter. I threw in some minced garlic as well. Dried herbs work fine if that's what you have. I served this with the spinach and parmesan chicken from this site. Thanks for a great recipe!

Could this be any easier?  Out of necessity I had to make ONE change.  I was out of fresh basil, so I substituted fresh baby spinach.  I also added halved, fresh red and yellow grape tomatoes after I stirred in the spinach and Parmesan cheese.  This will be a 'go to' recipe for sure and the simplicity of it allows for endless modifications to suit everyone's families likes.  Thank you for sharing DODIEPAJER!!

This was very good and very easy!!! The basil gave it a mild pesto flavor. This dish had a very authentic italian flavor. I doubled the recipe exactly, and it worked out fine.This dish is a very nice change from rice.I will definitely be making this quite often.

Hmmm...wasn't too crazy about this one. I left out the basil and even though there was nothing wrong with this as far as taste is concerned...it just didn't do anything for me.  My family didn't really comment on it either.  I'm not a fan of orzo pasta because I never use it.  I think I'll just stick to regular mac and cheese.  Thanks anyway.

My mom has always made a lamb and orzo dish that the whole family loves.  My kids have asked for just the pasta potion of the recipe before and this fits the bill perfectly.  I did add a little tomato powder (one of my favorite condiments)  to the broth and it was just perfect.  This was sooo easy and my family devoured it.  Thank you so much for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Loved this, it was a big hit!  It has just the right amount of each ingredient, although I added a little more cheese.  I wouldn't omit the basil, it added great flavor.

Whoa. This recipe is a keeper. Easy to make in one pot in 30 minutes. So stinkin' easy, yet tastes delicious and fancy!  I used cheapo Parmesan cheese and quadrupled the recipe, it was perfect!  Next time, gonna add in mushrooms and see if that goes well. Ooohhh, maybe bacon or prosciutto?!?  Yummy!!!!

Spectacular!  I sauteed some minced garlic in the butter before adding the orzo and finished it off with a dash of black pepper.  Double the recipe yielded enough for 3 adult and 2 toddler sized portions paired with some roasted zucchini ... next time I'll triple it!

Pretty good! A bit too much basil for my taste, but definitely a good recipe. I think next time I make it, I'll reduce the amount of basil and add a couple cloves of minced garlic. This seems like a recipe you can play with a lot and get really good results.

Very fresh and very flavorful, went really well with Grilled Shrimp Scampi from this site. Fresh basil is a must. also added 1 clove minced garlic. Easy to put together. Check orzo after 10 to 12 minutes as it may not take the length of time posted in recipe and you don't want it to burn. Mine was done in 12 minutes.

Amazing!  I will be making this again & again!  I did need a little more liquid to finish cooking the orzo.  I added diced up cooked chicken to make this a quick easy meal to have when I get home late from work.

This was pretty good. I was out of fresh basil so I used dried instead and I think I used just a bit too much. Next time I make this, I'm going to increase the parmesan cheese (my family loves cheese) and cut the basil down by half. Thanks for a great recipie!

This was just ok for us. We're used to orzo w/sauces of some sort so this was very dry for us. Not bad but not a favorite.

Even my two and three year old loved it! I got distracted and over browned the orzo in butter, but it still turned out great! I also only used 1/4 cup of Parmesan because we are watching calories and sodium. This was the first time making orzo and I may never try anything else. wonderful!

We loved this simple recipe.  I added Parsley and Basil and a couple dashes of garlic powder. I sprinkled with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Served with grilled chicken, garden salad and fresh fruit. Will make again!

This dish is fantastic! even though I used dried basil instead of fresh, and chicken boullion instead of broth. I didn't measure the cheese or basil, I just eyeballed it.

This sounded better than it was.  I brought to a party and people liked it though.  I was hoping it was going to better.  Next time I may add some sauteed garlic and onions to give it a more complex flavor....and possibly some white wine in the broth.  I need to experiment.  Definitely don't make ahead of time.  Serve when ready.  It had a very nice creamy texture almost like risotto.  It lost that when reheated.

Great recipe.  It was a little salty though, I used 1/4 c powdered jar parmesan and 1/4 cup freshly grated, which is salty.  Plus the chicken broth AND I added salt.  Next time I will use reduced sodium broth and don't add any extra.

Good side dish, but I think the basil is a little overpowering, so I will use less next time.  Leftovers are very dry though because of the cheese.

I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, so I used 1 t of dried basil. The orzo I used absorbed the liquid in about 10 minutes. Very good with A Good Easy Garlic Chicken also found on this site.

A little bland, after I tasted it made to the recipe I went ahead and added some garlic powder and onion powder. We had steamed broccoli and shredded cheese on the table so my sons added some of each after their test taste and declared it good!

This was outstanding! I didn't have any shreaded parmesan or fresh basil on hand so I used a white cheddar and a little more dried basil instead. It turned out great. This is one of those sides that goes with just about anything. My boyfriend loved it and he is tough to impress! Will definitely make again.

This was VERY good and simple.  It is a wonderful side dish.

I took the suggestion of others to cut down the butter and found 1 1/2 Tbsp. to be plenty.  You really could decrease the cheese without losing the cheese flavor, too.  Basil?  1/4 cup was fine, but more would be good, too.  Can you HAVE too much fresh basil?  MMMmmm.......

I also added pine nuts while toasting the orzo....good with or without.  I personally liked the crunch.

This recipe is such a refreshing alternative to pasta side dishes! Very simple to prepare, but everyone thought it was a "gourmet" dish. It looks and smells so inviting, and even the picky eaters and kids had second helpings. I used fresh-grated parmagiano reggiano (very flavorful)the first time, which was fabulous, but it's also good with freshly grated parmesan. Thank you for this one - a keeper!

This makes an excellent side dish!  Very easy and quick.  Much like rice-a-roni type dishes, but with a richer flavor.  Another thing I love is being able to know exactly what is going into my meal, rather than adding some mystery packet of powder.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is fast, easy, and relatively inexpensive! I'd agree that it's more like a side dish...but it depends on the size of the family and what size meals you're used to. Very tasty, I added more freshly grated parmesan than it called for cause I love cheese. I added LOTS of fresh basil (cause I had some I needed to use up) and more fresh diced tomatoes too. It's a very tasty recipe!! Something different for a change.

Loved the flavor but needed to add more broth as well, would recommend almost 2 cans and adding chopped sun-dried tomatoes while it is simmering is a good addition.

Easy, creamy and cheesy with just the right amount of basil.  A bit too thick though.  The broth boils off much faster than 15 minutes (10?).  I like the recommendation of another reviewer to add more warm chicken broth just before serving so it's not so heavy.

Great recipe!  Perfect side dish.  I add a clove of minced garlic to the butter first.  And omit the basil.  I just sprinkle the parmesan cheese to taste.

I found it really tasty!  I'm a big fan of the flavor of browned butter, so toasting the orzo in the butter prior to reconstituting it really made this dish in my opinion.  I made the recipe exactly as written - I would definitely make this again!!

This was a great side to kabobs that I prepared on the grill. Received great reviews at dinner. I did have to add about 1/4 c. Additional chicken broth. Otherwise, would definitely make again.

Update: April 2019  I now make this with fresh rosemary instead of basil for a switch.  My home smells delish from the rosemary. When I have the windows open, my neighbors in the condo building all comment on the delicious aroma! 
Husband loves it!

I had a box of Orzo forever that I've been meaning to try. This recipe is simple and tastes like the orzo that I would order from the restaurant! I didn't have parmesan cheese, but added asparagus to the recipe for some green color and it tasted great. I also forgot to add in the basil at the end... still tasted great. My family loved it. Thank you for the great recipe :)

I only gave this four stars due to user error. This was very good. However, I made the mistake of adding the cheese before the liquid absorbed completely. It was still really good but I know next time (tomorrow) it will be great because I will let the liquid completely absorb before adding the cheese and basil.

Love this recipe as it goes good with anything.  The only changes that I have made over time is that I use 1/3 cup of parmesan( part grated and part shredded) and 1 tsp of dried basil because that is what I usually have on hand.  As others have noted, I do need to add chicken broth at the end to thin it out a bit because it does tend to thicken up a bit.  This is definitely a family favorite.

This is a really good recipe. Made it exactly according to instructions. It was good the next day at lunch AND reheated the following day with Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage. Good combination.

I would suggest that you use a 10-inch skillet, no larger. Then the dish won't dry out or cook too fast.

Great! Easy!  Did exactly as written, except I added a chopped clove of garlic with the butter in the beginning. Had the garlic and needed to use it.  My oldest daughter is picky and she LOVED it!

We LOVE this recipe.  I usually add onion and saute with the orzo before adding the broth.  We also add more basil than called for and less cheese but add it back after it's cooked.

This dish was a huge hit! I adjusted the recipe for 6 and my family LOVED it! since my wife doesn't like cheese all that much I let the people choose to use cheese. We use Pecorino-Romano instead of Parmesan. I made a 1 1/2 cups of Orzo & used one box of Chicken Stock. Mixed in the fresh Basil (right from my own garden). Seasoned it with Salt & Pepper and voila'! Absolutely delicious. This was paired with a grilled Tuna recipe from here. it was the one marinated in EVOO only. Incredible meal and a new favorite of my family

I LOVE an easy recipe that tastes great!  I used my own homemade broth and butter, fresh basil from the garden.  I skipped the salt and used non dairy Parmesan cheese. I doubled the recipe and am soooo glad I did.  We loved this!  I will make again and will add additional vegetables such as sun dried tomatoes and zucchini - possibilities are endless.......

For those who had the sticking problem you cut the fire off too late.  Try cutting it earlier so when it is hot it will absorb the extra water.  I deeply loved it.  My husband did not but did eat it.  I ate with Mediterranean Lemon Chicken

After seeing what good reviews this recipe got I was surprised at how bland it was. The only thing that gave it any taste was the basil and my boyfriend thought it was overpowering. I will not be making this again.

Yummy side dish.  I didn't have nearly enough basil, but it was still very good.  Enjoyed this with leftover Tri-Tip.  I'll make this again.

Oh so good I could have eaten it as a main dish!  I rarely follow a recipe exactly, but this one did not need any tweaking.  I'll bet this would taste good with cherry tomatoes in addition to the basil.

This was pretty good but nothing spectacular.  I might make it again if I don't have another recipe for orzo.

Love It!  A good change from the same old rice or potato side.  Also a great way to use all of my fresh basil in the yard.  Have made this several times.

i used dried basil and it was way too overpowering.  I felt like i was eating straight basil.  Next time will do with a little fresh and hopefully the flavor won't be so much.

This is a great side dish!  I love pasta and hubby loves rice...this is the perfect compromise! The only thing I do differently is use a good shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.  Its delicious!  Thank you!

We really wanted to like this - after all, pasta, cheese & basil .... but there was just something off for us.  I don't know if it was the (lack of multiple) texture (very creamy which I'm sure many love) or what ..... Hubby took one bite, and said "needs hot sauce".

Awesome!  I omitted the butter (just wasn't needed), and didn't add salt (chicken broth and parmesan have it already).  Added 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Perfect!  Next time I will double this - just didn't make enough to go with an entree (plus, you need more for seconds!).  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was good.  The only problem I had was with the cooking time.  I used whole wheat orzo, which should take longer to cook than the regular kind, and it was done in 12 minutes.  The liquid had not been absorbed and if I had cooked it until it was, it would have been a big pan of mush.  So I drained off the excess liquid and proceded with the recipe.  We just loved this.  I even ate the leftovers, cold, for breakfast!  Thanks so much for the post, DODIEPAJER!

Nice easy side dish to make.   Followed the recipe exactly as stated and it came out lovely.  I haven't really made Orzo a lot as a side dish so this is a good basic recipe that I can doctor up with other flavors if I so chose.   Nice.

This is my new favorite side!  I wasn't sure whether it meant fresh shredded parmesan or the stuff in the can, so I used fresh and it was amazing.  I figured the stuff in a can would be grainy.  This was absolutely fantastic and made as is.  I may have added a little extra chicken broth just because I used homemade instead of the can and measured it differently.  2 cups maybe (16 oz.)?

This is fantastic. Ordinarily I wouldn't make any adjustments but I didn't have enough parmesan so I used half Romano. It still was great. I served it with some boiled shrimp and sliced tomatoes. The whole meal only took about 15 minutes.  Thanks for a recipe that I will be making over and over.

I made this for my family on fathers day. Everyone raved about it and there were no leftovers! Obviously, if you don't like parmesan cheese it wouldn't be for you. It had a great amount of flavor but it wasn't over bearing either.

Yummmeeeee!  This is just great.  I didn't intend to tweek but my 15 year old daughter was making it and failed to measure the orzo. She used more than called for so we needed to add liquid.  Added some cream (actually coffee creamer we had on hand) and the remainder of the chicken broth. Just made do and increased parmesan.  You can modifiy this if you want with still exceptional results. I am sure you could substitute some white wine in if run out of broth as well.  I might try adding toasted pine nuts next time.  This one is great because you can make as written or be creative!

I always use dry chicken bouillon in water to make my own broth. I added a tiny bit too much and it was slightly salty. A correctable mistake that is no fault of the recipe maker. I got to use my fresh basil from my garden and we loved it!

This side dish was awesome, cheap, and easy!! Just a few tips to really take it to the next level: While the orzo was cooking, in separate pans I sauteed a package of fresh, sliced mushrooms and a bag of fresh spinach (Used separate pans for each veggie). Once the shrooms were done I cut the larger ones down a bit, to allow them to be more spread out in the orzo. Once orzo was finished cooking I added the parm cheese (used a lot less, just kinda sprinkled, stirred, and tasted til I got to my liking. Another addition is I sprinkled granulated garlic in it (BE CAREFUL - A little of that stuff goes a  long way, but if you just add a tad, it gives a yummy hint of garlic). Once the orzo was to my liking, I mixed in the cooked mushrooms and spinach and that was it!! Very easy and delish! I agree about the cooking time - it only took my orzo about 13 mins or so - don't overcook! No one likes a mushy pasta! Thanks so much for the recipe, its a keeper! :)

I made this to go along with some salmon for dinner last night.  It was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half.  The basil did seem to be quite strong.  I think next time I'll try another reviewer's idea and leave out the basil and add mushrooms & baby spinach.  Sounds good that way.

So easy, quick, and tasty! I didn't have any chicken stock so I just added 2 bouillon cubes to 2 cups boiling water, let that dissolve while I browned my orzo, and then added. The only other change I made was to add some minced garlic, as I do to everything I cook ;) I would have to agree with others in saying that this recipe could really be adapted to whatever your personal tastes may be.

The Orzo was soo simple to do in this recipe...I'm amazed, I totally will do the recipe again. However, we totally disliked the basil in the recipe...it was way too much for our tastes. I actually had to make another batch, because this recipe was too small for my family and lowered the basil to half the amount stated. Other then that. The recipe was great. If your not used to eating basil alone in recipes..it might be a put off. However, I recommend adjusting the flavor intensity to your liking. Ours has half the amount. Thanks otherwise.

Oh no I only made two servings! And then my husband wanted more!  Used dried basil since I didn't have fresh... wish I had added the spinach I had on hand for color... very good! Nice change. Will make this one again.

Update I've been making this often as written except half the butter and family loves it! / I liked the idea of toasting the orzo first. I think it lent a nice flavor. Next time, I'll use 1/2 the butter. I didn't have fresh basil but was making a another dish with Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto (all pine nuts) and added 2 teaspoons of that instead. Yummy! Thank you!

Easy and very tasty!  Only change was to add a little bit of Tony Chachere's seasoning right before I added in the cheese and basil.  Next time I will probably only put in 3/4 cup of cheese and I do like the suggestion of adding in some sauteed mushrooms and baby spinach.

Our new favourite family meal! I have tried half parmesean and half romano cheese to make the full amount, and that worked quite excellent! We have made this quite a few times and never tire of it. The flavour combinations are just perfect!

Wow, what a dish.  I added sauteed mushrooms and used high quality dried basil (my fresh basil went bad in the fridge overnight).  Fantastic.  I will make this often in a variety of ways.  Thanks for the recipe!

Have made this twice now.  First time with fresh basil=awesomeness.  Second time with dried (didn't have fresh on hand and thought i'd try it out) big mistake!  Stick with the fresh.  This is such a yummy recipe even my 3 year old liked it.

This was extremely tasty, although I did need to use extra chicken broth in order to fully cook the orzo (I also was making 3 servings rather than 4, so perhaps the proportions threw the recipe off). Very easy recipe overall. I will definitely be making this again.

This was surprisingly delicious for a dish with so few ingredients.  Even my DH who doesn't typically like pasta or anything cheesy really liked this dish.  Although I did have to keep reminding him that it was NOT rice.

This was my 1st time cooking orzo alone and not in a pilaf and it was a big success! I was unable to use chicken broth, but used water and chicken bullion and it worked just fine. Also had no fresh basil so used dried and it was still great! This is a great change from traditional mac and cheese that is much tastier too. Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe was EXTREMELY easy!! I used 2 extra TBSP of butter (I know I know....fat fat fat!) but good good good! and put some chopped vermicelli in mine....then followed the recipe but I used dried basil and garlic for the seasoning. It is very tasty. Oh and by the way you could just stop after the orzo is tender and it is still very good.

This was good.  I would make it again.  I doubled the recipe, but still kept the butter at 2 tbsps, and I don't think it made a difference in how it was.  I think I used a little too much broth, but once I drained the excess, it was fine.  I also used a little too much pepper because was I tried to do it "to taste", it didn't work.  I also omitted the fresh basil because I didn't have it.  Since I was making it for a main course, I added frozen veggies to the mix when I added the broth.  It made it pretty good and I might do that even when using this as a side dish.  But, this is definitely a better side dish than a main course.

Delicious!  Nice and light, but full of flavor.  I didnt have fresh basil, so I used dried.  The fresh would definitely make it even better.  This is a great side for almost any meal.  Will for sure make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious; even if I did not have enough basil.  I brought some but I did not use it right away.  I seasoned it with some McCormick Perfect Pinch - Original it was yummy. I will definitely make again -- even my picky mom enjoyed the dish.

I liked this, but it was a little greasy for my taste.  I think next time I will cut the butter down to 1 TB. instead of 2.  Make sure you use good parm. for this since you need a good strong flavor.  I would also recommend pumping up your chicken broth with an extra bouillon cube (low sodium if you can) to get as much flavor as possible.

Very tasty indeed.  Along with the pasta I cooked chunks of chicken breast so we could eat this as the main dish.  Needless to say, we all licked our plates clean.  We don't eat pasta often but the next time we do I'll use this method again.

Made exactly as stated. Easy, tasty side dish. Next time I will do what others have suggested and try adding in some tomatoes or maybe using pesto instead (or in addition to) the basil.

Made exactly as is. I would rate this 5 stars if it didn't turn out dry like after adding parmesan cheese.  Had to add some milk and still wasn't right.  I will figure something out for the next time because it tasted great otherwise.

Perfect just the way the recipe is written.  I make it as is all the time.  It is easy to add too.  My favorite is to stir in some fresh spinach and chopped tomatoes.  The whole family devours this dish. Also very simple to make.

This recipe was simple yet very delicious! An excellent touch that I added was toasting some pine nuts lightly on the stovetop in a pan, then adding them in the final steps, the nutty flavor of the nuts adds great flavor to the familiar ingredients to a pesto!

This tastes great!  I like to add baby portabella mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and chicken to the mix for a "one skillet meal" I don't have to mess with.  I love the flavors together!

This is delish.  It was good as written but I did take other reviewers' advice and had some extra chicken stock on hand.  I also added a bit of garlic powder, wanted to use fresh but didn't have any on hand, and some chopped sun-dried tomatoes.  Yummy!!

This recipe is so simple, delicious and elegant!  Thanks so much for sharing it.  I made it a year ago for the first time for my kids and hubby (who loved it) and have impressed many a dinner guest with it since then.  It has just as nice a presentation as it does flavor.  I've even added sauteed baby portabellas on occasion which also goes well with this flavor combination.  Thanks again!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!  The only change i made was to saute in some fresh garlic when i "browned" the orzo and then I was forced to use dried basil.  Other than that I followed the recipe and was delighted.  The kids gobbled it up and I went back for seconds.  I've already emailed my sister the recipe and will be adding this to our list of regular sides!!  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.

I didn't have fresh basal or chicken stock so I used spinach, rather than basal, and vegetable stock, rather than chicken stock and it came out excellent. Great recipe!

I only had dried parsley, worked fine. I don't think I sauteed the garlic long enough though. Still tasted good! Definitely recommend this!

Very Good.  I thought it was going to be a little bit more creamy but the flavor was great. Did use a little more chicken broth.   Wonderful to use basil grown from our garden.  Definately something I would make again, may even add roasted vegetables next time.

Absolutely lovely. I added some sauteed onions and mushrooms (right in with the browning orzo) and cut down just a tad on the fresh shredded parmesan. I think my family would have loved this recipe just as written, though, and for sure we'll make it often! Thanks!

I used the whole bag of orzo, which tripled the recipe and adjusted everything else accordingly.  Instead of basil, I added a couple tablespoons of leftover pesto from the freezer.

Will definitely substitute pesto for basil the next time I make this! Delicious!

I've been meaning to make this for a while now & I finally did...sorry I waited so long. This recipe was wonderful. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2 cup of sour cream and about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Everyone was looking for seconds!

We love this recipe! I used to make it several years ago after finding it in a magazine, but then I lost it. I figured I'd find something similar on this site and was happy that I found the exact same recipe. I frequently change the seasonings and other add-ins up to change the flavors and use this instead of the ubiquitous noodles and sauce packets that many people buy at the grocery store.

This was just ok. It really doesn't have very much flavor. I think there other things you could add that would be better. I will not make this again.

This is a great tasting way to make orzo. Simple too! I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry, but not as much. All of the men(1,5,and 25) in my house loved it!! Thanks!

Holy cow was this a FABULOUS side dish.  I used tri-color orzo and I agree with others that it is essential to use fresh parmesan cheese to get the best flavor.  Ofcourse me being the garlic lover..I added in some diced up garlic cloves while browning the orzo.  Will make again and again and again!  Don't pass this one up.

Fantastic side dish prepared by following recipe. Also try-Plain Orzo: 2 TBS butter, 1 cup uncooked orzo sauted until lightly browned, 1 can chicken broth. Salt/Pepper to taste. Simmer for 15-20 mins. (Leave out the basil & parmesan and it still tastes great.)

This recipe is fantastic! I made no alterations to it at all. I highly recommend using fresh parmesan cheese. I grated it right before adding to the orzo and it was devine!

The only downside was that I made it for 6 servings, as we had a 6 person dinner party and it was gone. A week later one of our guests emailed me for the recipe. She couldn't stop thinking about how good it was. I'll make again and again, and it so easy!

This is so delicious, and we had plenty leftover the next day. I used pasta parmesan and didn't quite get the same effect, so I guess I will use freshly grated next time. Try adding some black olives in there if you're feeling adventurous -I can assure you it's really good!- and serve with a stick loaf of bread. Good addition to the list of dishes to make when I'm in a rush, and you can take it on the go in a Tupperware container. Thank you for sharing this!

So good!  We make this a lot in our house.  My kids love it and its a nice change from the regular every day sides.  I like to buy the jarred roasted red peppers, chop up half of one and add it in when I add the parmesan.  The red pepper adds color to your meal and a nice flavor that compliments the orzo.  Thanks for the recipe!

simply delicious, and very easy. The chicken broth, fresh basil, and parmesan put a lot of flavor into the dish.

This was so easy - and delicious.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the butter at the start and then added the orzo.  Next time I make it, I'll cut back on the butter and cheese to make it a bit healther - I am certain it will be just as good.  I will definitely make this again.

OMG!!! I loved it!  The first thing that I proclaimed was that "this is my new rice!"  Seriously, this was amazing.  I followed the recipe to the T, but towards the end, when adding the basil and cheese, I also added about 1/4 cup Feta Cheese crumbles.  They melted well, but the occasional mound that was left in the orzo was a welcome burst of flavor!  I used another reviewers suggestion, and topped with diced roma tomato!  5 HUGE stars!

Yum... I love fresh basil, so I added more.  Freshly grated parmesan is key, too.  Next time I'll add some sun-dried tomatoes.  Thanks for an easy and tasty side dish!

DELICIOUS!  Orzo with parmesan and basil has become a staple in our home - I make it at least once a week as a welcome change from rice or potatoes.  For the folks having problems with this being too dry, or the cheese clumping, add the cheese and chopped basil JUST BEFORE serving - this way it doesn't have time to dry out/clump.

Me and a group of guys made this for a cooking competition and I think the ladies all fell in love with us.  I never got a chance to taste it, but everyone raved about it.  It was soo easy to make too.  We served it with the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan by Phoebe (on this site) which also got big cheers.  I will make this again and again.

I'm glad that I tried this a second time - I must have done something wrong the first time around.  My family loved it the second time and there was no leftovers. The fresh basil (I think that I used dried the first time and it was flat) and the parmesan cheese was a great combination. Simmer 15 rather than 20 or else it will dry out.  This is an easy dish that I will make more than likely on a weekly basis.

This is very flavorful!  I only put in 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. (That was all I had.) I also used italian seasoning instead of the basil and I added garlic powder.  Mmmm... Next time I want a quick and delicious recipe, I'll definately be making this.

I just happened to run across some tri-colored orzo on clearance and couldn't resist giving it a try. I can't believe how good this is!  I took a few suggestions from other posters, using spinach and chicken boullion[because I didn't have any broth] and instead of basil, I used a garlic and Italian seasoning.  WHAT A KEEPER!  Next time I'm making it to go with the "Spinach Stuffed Chicken Breasts" I found on here.....they're amazing and this is perfect to serve with!  BIG THANX to Dodie!

This was AWESOME!  I've never had orzo before but I used tri-colored southwestern orzo so it had a little kick to it.  I also used only 1 tbls of butter, omited the basil sprigs on top, and used 1 tbls of dried basil instead of 1/4 cup of fresh.  Will definitely make this one very often!  VERY YUMMY!

Pretty good, a good alternative to the rice we usually have with grilled chicken.  I did not use the basil, but did saute some minced garlic and onion in the butter with the orzo.  Will make this again when I can find some decent fresh basil.

I used only 1 tbsp butter to cut down on the fat. The orzo was not tender before all the chicken broth was absorbed so I ended up adding about 1/4-1/3 cup of water. The end product tasted great and was a nice change of pace.

WOW!  This deserves more than 5 stars.  Would be a great side dish to any kind of meat entree.  I served it with salmon and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only thing I will do differently is to add the fresh basil right before serving.  Mine sat for a while before serving and the basil turned very dark.  It tasted great, but would look more appealing if the basil kept more of its bright green color.

I religously serve "rice a roni" with many of my main dishes. NO MORE! This is a close sub! I used dried basil and less of it. Now, if I could only find a recipe for ramen noodles...;) Many thanks Dodie!

This is a quick and delicious alternative to risotto!  I sauteed a few finely chopped onions before adding the orzo.  I have also tried it omitting the basil and adding chopped pancetta (you could use bacon).  Thanks for a great simple side dish Dodie, my family loves it!

I omitted the basil and had a wonderful side dish.  The kids loved it and it was quick and easy.  A great "base recipe" as so many things could be added for a totally different taste.

This was Wonderful!  I added 1 small diced white onion to the butter and cooked until tender before adding the orzo to brown.  I also will cut down the basil to 2 TBSP. the next time.  It is delicious and I'll definitely be using this many more times!

Very, very good.  I think I had the heat too high, b/c all the liquid was gone way before the timer said it should be, so I added a little more and turned down the heat and it was fantastic.  My family practically licked the pot clean.  Next time I will need to double or triple it so we can have leftovers. :)

This was great!!
I have never attempted to make orzo before because it looked to intimidating, but I will be making this again and again.  Hubby and I both loved it and it was so easy and quick.
Oh and I left out the basil because I didn't have any and it was YUMMY!

I made this as a side dish for Lincolnshire sausages and it was a match made in heaven! I didn’t have basil so I added some frozen spinach instead. I also used several kinds of cheese I was trying to finish off - parmesan, mozzarella, edam, and cream cheese (about 3/4 cup total). I followed the instructions and the orzo came out al dente, exactly the way we like it. It took about 16 minutes for it to absorb the chicken stock. I also added a dash of garlic salt. As others have mentioned, this dish is very flexible and you can add herbs or vegetables or a protein (bacon!) to match a main dish.

We liked the end product but like other reviewers, I had to keep adding more chicken stock as it cooked. Keep a watch on it, because if you leave it "simmering covered for 15-20 minutes" it will probably burn. I suppose if you reduce the heat to low, this wouldn't be a problem but I had it on medium heat. I followed the recipe exactly - and will probably make it again with mushrooms too!

Well, I confess that I used EVOO instead of butter and my orzo came out quite greasy, which is saying a lot because I am not usually someone to shy away from greasy food. I should try it again with butter to give it a fair second chance, but I admit that the first try was really not appetizing. I gave it a 4 to be fair, since I didn't follow it to a T, but I personally felt it was more of a 2.5.

I had never made orzo before so I was a bit nervous to try this recipe, but I am so glad I did! It was super easy to make and it turned out delicious. I couldn't find fresh basil so I used some from the freezer section instead. Will definitely be making this again very soon.

Love this recipe!  I tried it first to the letter--excellent.  Next time, I didn't have broth on hand, so used bouillon/water, and a little white wine I had left in the fridge.  I also had no basil on hand.  As other reviewers have noted, it is so versatile, you can do anything and it comes out great!

Delicious!  I added fresh asparagus, fresh mushrooms, Kalmata olives and a fresh tomato because I had so many fresh veggies.  Also, I added a Penzy spice.

This is a quick and easy recipe that everyone loved. I made it with dried basil as I did not have any fresh on hand and it was yummy. I found it cooks quicker and the liquid was absorbed faster than the stated time, so don't leave it unattended.  It does clump together if not eaten immediately, so next time I may try cooking it with olive oil as others have suggested.

This really was good.  We were out of fresh basil and used some fresh spinach we wilted in the microwave instead. There was none left!  I did use a really great aged Parmesan that I hand grated right before mixing.  I'll likely try this with the pre-grated stuff in the future and I think it will be just as good.  Wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe for awhile now "as is" and find it delicious!! I am a basil fiend!  But as I had no basil on hand and a bunch of farm fresh broccoli, I decided to throw some of that in!  It is fantastic with broccoli!!! I think this is a great base recipe to do with as you please :) Great stuff!

Yum! I wasn't sure how this would be but everyone loved it!  I probably only put half of the basil but next time I will add the full amount. Tastes a lot like risoto but a lot less work.

A very versatile recipe.  I made it using the ingredients called for in the recipe and loved it.  But you could easily add your favorite herbs/spices to change it up!  I did need to use a bit more chicken broth to finish cooking the orzo.  I will definitely make this again.  Great side dish.

This recipe was very good, but plain. It was a perfect side dish with chicken, but I add artichoke hearts and pine nuts to add more flavor. I have also though about adding some garlic and sautéed spinach to add some flavor for the dish. It's a great base for a side dish and definitely will make again with more additions.

Terrific! Served at a dinner party and every last bite was gone at the end of dinner. Just the way I like it. I think I may have cut back just a little bit on the butter but otherwise followed the recipe. I also doubled and may not have had enough fresh basil so added a couple of Tbsp's of pesto. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe pretty much as outlined in the original.  I used sea salt to flavor instead of iodinized salt and tossed the orzo with a little more Parmesan right before I served it.  My husband loved it.

Our favorite side dish, it goes with everything. It's fabulous with normal orzo, but if you happen to have a special orzo it's even better. We often use garlic and lemon orzo and it's incredible.

I made this substituting 1 tablespoon of pesto for the basil. I added diced roast turkey to make it more like a meal. It was good. I would like try it again with the fresh basil.

I am just starting to cook and responsible for dinner for two every night. This was very simple and I need simple. It was also a hit.  I didn't have basil but I did have a basil based mixed spice from Penzy's (Sunny Paris) it was delicious.

I love this recipe. During the summer we grow fresh basil so I'm always looking for new ways to use it up. This is one of my favorite ways! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I've never had orzo and it was a bit of a challenge finding in the store but now I know where to look.  I may add a little garlic to the butter the next time.

Oh my gosh...sooooo good!!  I made this as a side dish for another recipe on this site "Parmesan crusted salmon."  Needless to say, it was a hit!  I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe. Super simple and SUPER YUMMY!

My family loved this recipe. I sautéed a clove of garlic minced, when I was browning the orzo. That added a nice touch. I will definitely do this again and again.

This was really good.  I added the suggested sauted spinach, onion, and garlic.  I also added diced, cooked chicken to make it a main dish.  I used some great orzo I bought at the farmer's market.

I fried the orzo, added the broth and cooked 15 min on low.  Then, because I didn't have enough Parmesan cheese or fresh basil, I added about 3-4 T goat cheese and fresh dill from my neighbor.  I could have added a little bit more goat cheese and dill but everyone loved it.  Can't wait to try it with basil and Parmesan.

Was really tasty, but turned out to be a bit dry. I think I might have cooked too long? Next time I will add more liquid to finish off so its a bit more moist.

I made this recipe with the Trader Joes Couscous Mix that has orzo, couscous, beans, etc. It was AMAZING!!!! I got so many compliments and questions about what this amazing dish was! I had my cousin help me who has never cooked before (it's that easy), my picky 10 year old nephew ate two servings of it, and my European friend said it was the best dish he's ever had! I followed the recipe exactly. Easy and yummy! You can easily add grilled salmon or chicken for those who want some meat in it.

Best Orzo ever. Only recipe I follow step by step, and love. If you ever need a great side, or even a quick dinner, Orzo w/ Parmesan & Basil is the best choice. It is smooth, creamy, and delicous; as mentioned above, a mediterranean version of Mac & Cheese. Definitely a dish you won't ever get enough of...

Excellent recipe, and very simple/fast. I used olive oil instead of butter and added a bit of cayenne pepper. With the parmesan and chicken broth, this doesn't need any extra salt, but cracked black pepper is a must!

This is my absolute favorite side dish.  I make it all the time, soooooo easy.  I usually just use dried basil instead of fresh.  I've used water and chicken bouillion in a pinch when I'm out of chicken broth.  Sometimes I even use Kraft parmesan (in the green can) if I don't have any fresh parmesan to grate. It's always delicious. Also, I always increase the recipe by 50-100% because everyone in my family of four loves this. We actually call this dish "more-zo" because you always want more.

This was perfect!  The only thing I noticed was that I needed to add more broth. Even though it was tasty as is, this is one of those recipes you can use as foundation to a variety of creations using additional or other ingredients.  Simply loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my go-to side dish! Very good recipe. The parm and the butter is delish! I added 10 oz bag of spinach and sometimes add peas. Family loves it!

This is a great side dish if you are having a main dish with a strong flavour. I didn't care for so much parmesan, I will probably add some asiago next time. But that's just personal taste and this is a nice, easy side.

Way too much liquid I should have drained it off.  because there was so much liquid, plus the cheese, at it cooled it ended up as a solid mass. Tasty, especially with the fresh basil.  Will try again, but will drain when the orzo is done about 8 mins for me.

Absolutely delicious!  The only things I did differently was I added about 1 tsp of chopped garlic to the butter while it melted and used a shredded parmesan / romano / asiago blend instead of just parmesan.  Other than that, it's perfect... highly recommended! :)

Can't give it 5 stars because I've never used fresh basil in it. I usually have to settle for a little dried basil. I also like to add about 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes once in a while for a slightly different flavor.

I found that this recipe lacked flavor. I made this for my husband's family and they seemed to really love it, though they tend to be picky eaters who love carbs and more traditional american fare, unlike myself.  Fine for an easy side, but not impressive.

Good side dish. Family just assumed it was rice...until I made a point to tell them it was pasta! Didn't have fresh basil, so instead of using dried basil, went for the mac and cheese like other reviews mentioned. It was a nice change!

Needed much more liquid. Cut the basil by 1/4 and still overpowering. Ended up being a sticky, stringy basil flavored mess.

Great easy side dish. I added 1/4 cup diced onion and a garlic clove to the orzo when browning.  I also used homemade chicken broth that I had in the freezer.  Only comment is for 4 people I would definately double this recipe.

This is a really great recipe.   I’ve made it at least 3 times now. We don’t cook with butter, so I substituted olive oil and reduced to one tablespoon. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken since I’m a vegetarian.  This is a great side dish with Marsala!

Love the taste of this and it's so easy.  But my orzo was cooked in less than 10 minutes!  I'd follow the instructions on the pasta box, and watch it carefully.

This is a great side dish!  Love love love it!  I made chicken parmesan for dinner and normally have plain spaghetti and marinara sauce but thankfully I forgot to buy spaghetti noodles at the store.  I searched for an alternative recipe and now this is our new staple to serve with chicken parmesan.  No changes to the recipe and it was wonderful!!!!

This was wonderful! I cheated a bit and used dried basil and pre-grated cheese, but it was so easy to make and tasted incredible! Thank you!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this!  I love basil but  I only used about 2 tbsp of it since I wasn't sure if my husband would like it.  He ended up loving it as much as I do so next time I will use the full amount.  I didn't add salt or pepper - didn't need it, and I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.  Just wonderful....will be making again and again!!  Thanks for sharing!

I liked it, my bf was so so about it.  Flavors were good and it was very easy.  Made it again, sauteed garlic with the pasta and left out the cheese, bf liked it better this way.  I liked it either way, its pasta, whats not to like?

My husband and I LOVED this!  It's a great way to use the fresh basil we've been growing.  The only thing that I noticed was that I needed to stir somewhat frequently while the orzo was cooking in the skillet, or it kind of clumped together.

This was Delicous!  I had no grocerys in the house, so the orzo, game here to find a recipe and came across this one, few ingrediants all of which i had.  except like another review i read, do not leave this on the stove for 15 min...i did and burnt the whole bottom of the pan...i was able to salvage the top portion, i also added a little extra virgin olive oil for a little extra flavor.  will def make again...maybe add tomatoes and mushrooms next time...Mmmm

I made this tonight on a whim, and it was sooo good!  I topped with chicken breast that I cooked in a separate pan with garlic, salt and pepper.  Great meal.
I also doubled the parmesan, got a little carried away while grating it, but I thought it still tasted great!
Nice simple recipe that my family loved.

we loved this recipe!  I actually subbed out the butter and used olive oil and we added chicken breast to ours.  I cooked the chicken on the frying pan and then cut it up and added it when I added the chicken broth.  we used this as a main dish that way, and both thought it was delicious and filling.

this went right onto hubby's, "please make again," list.

My husband and I both loved this, makes a great side dish, the basil adds such a nice flavor. I thought it was a little heavy on the butter, next time I will only use 1 tablespoon.

Part of me wants to tinker wtih this recipe, but it's just so good - the simplicity really stands on its own, so I don't think I will.  The basil makes it taste really fresh.  I kept explaining what I wanted to make to the fiance, and he wasn't interested, but after tasting it, he said 'Why have you been hiding this from me?'  Loved the delicate flavor of the fresh parmiggiano reggiano, and LOVED that this recipe used the entire can of chicken broth and doesn't leave me with 1/2 a cup that I don't know what to do with!  This recipe is absolutely perfect, and except for the fresh basil, I expect to have everything I need on me at all times.

5 stars for easy but gourmet-tasting.  I used whole wheat orzo, added spinach, and used about half the cheese.  Next time, I will add bella mushrooms.

Made this for dinner last night to accompany grilled chicken thighs and a mixed-green salad. It was delicious! Very flavorful. I did add a splash or two of light cream to the cooked orzo because the pasta soaked up all the chicken broth -- but this gave the dish a nice creaminess. My boyfriend, who usually doesn't care for orzo, liked it prepared this way. I think next time I will add some pine nuts to the dish.

Although I didn't add any salt, the food was still way too salty! Will do it again with half water/half broth to lower the sodium, and will also reduce the parmesan to 1/3 cup.

I love this recipe! Its a perfect side dish to pretty much any meat dish. I've made it about four times now : w/ Steak, Chicken, even Salmon. Despite my explanation that its a kind of pasta, my husband tells me every time I make it how he likes that "weird rice". :-)

Very good as written. Also good with dried basil and bouillon as substitutions. Cook the pasta on a low simmer to make the liquid last as long as it takes to cook.

i have done this with rotini pasta and just boiled it in some stock/water (because i didn't have enough stock) and let it absorb. i turned off the heat before all the liquid evaporated. Edit: good as recipe says. I added grape tomatoes cut in half.

A nice comfort food. The tastes all kind of meld together and form an amazing yummy dish. I would recommended add a bit of chicken stock if you put anyway for leftovers. When I went to reheat it was sort of like glue in the container and really dry when heated.

I've just made this recipie for the first time an I can't say enough good things about it!!! The only change I made was to add 2 smashed garlic cloves while sautating the orzo, which i pulled out before adding broth. I can't stress how great this tasted! I've been a member for four or five yrs an this was the first review I've given. I had to leave the kitchen because I couldn't stop "tasting" it!!!

This was delicious and quick and easy...I also added mushrooms, peas and spinach for more nutrition and flavor..I also omitted the basil and it was still great...I recomend stirring the orzo every 3-4min while its cooking or else it will stick easy...Will make again!

Not as flavorful as I would have thought. Next time I would add more salt early on and more basil too.

This is soooo easy and soooo good. 

The second time around I used olive oil in place of the butter. It was still delicious and a little more guilt free!!!

Fantastic! I made this as a side dish when my in-laws were over for dinner.They and my husband raved about it! Served it with Chicken Cordon Bleu and a tossed salad. I even forgot to cover the pan and it still turned out great! Can't wait to make it again.

We really liked this dish. Even tho' I am Italian I don't like my pasta too al dente, so I think in the future I would either use a little less orzo or a little more broth. Very good side dish.

I'm rating it a 4 but my husband says it's a 5 star dish and could eat it as an entire meal (even without meat in it and he has to have meat at each dinner). I think next time I'll add asparagus and mushrooms and more cheese. Very yummy though :)

Great flavors and a good alternative side dish.  It is necessary to use freshly grated Parmesan cheese though.  The powdered stuff will turn it mealy and pasty and ruin the dish.  Not that I would ever stoop so low as to use powdered cheese in order to save a few bucks.

Very rich tasting and easy.  Next time I might use part olive oil and part butter just to cut the salt a tiny bit (or use unsalted butter).

Yummy! I used to make another orzo recipe on here, but decided to give this one a try because it was a little healthier, using less butter - and boy am I glad I did! YUM. I usually add a little garlic to mine too. I made it 2 nights in a row, I liked it so much, and will probably make it again this week. When I don't have chicken broth, I use a chicken bouillon and water, like another reviewer suggested, and it turns out just as well.

Really good!!!! I've done it twice, first time as directed, and turned out really good.   A variation: Toss in about a 1/2 cup of a chunky homemade tomato sauce, and then parmesan cheese & basil..... It was awesome!!!! Just make sure you have an all natural homemade sauce (as in EVOO, onion, basil & tomato + bit of sugar).

Very easy to make and tasty. I am a garlic lover so I added minced garlic to the butter before adding the Orzo to brown. Made this for a potluck and there was none left!

I found this to be a bit disappointing.  Yes, orzo and cheese go together well, but the basil didn't taste quite right with it.  I gave it three stars because while it isn't stellar, it was quite edible.

Doubled the recipe for a dinner party.  Substituted vegetable broth for chicken to support vegetarian daughter and added less cheese than directed. Turned out great.  All of the flavors married well.  Reheated in microwave with extra broth the next day and still very good.  Will make again using all of the cheese.

Perfect as written. Didn't change a thing. Everyone loved it. This recipe is easy, on the table in under 30 minutes and delicious. If possible, use freshly grated Parmesan. It does make a difference. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. Using the full amount of butter was way too greasy for me. The second time, I used maybe 1/2 T. butter and some olive oil, and it was much better.

This was amazing!  I served this as a side dish to marinated/grilled chicken breast at my son's birthday party and everyone LOVED it!  I tripled the recipe and also added chopped tomato, pine nuts and extra chicken broth.  The taste, texture and presentation was amazing!  This is a keeper!  Add slices of chicken to the orzo and it would make an excellent, company-worthy main dish!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is a really good, simple side dish recipe.  Do serve it immediately because the cheese will harden quickly.

I liked this...but I didn't love it. I think it needs a little something. I'm not sure what, maybe tomatoes? More seasonings? This was just "ok" for us.

This was much too cheesy for my liking, but not the fault of the poster :) I was just hoping for a "hint" of parmesan, but this is so cheesy that when you eat it you have strings of cheese going from your plate to your mouth. It was a little bland as well, needs something else.

This gets five stars from me even though I changed the cooking method.  I basically made 1/2 the recipe using only 1/2 T. of butter to saute the orzo.  I then added 1 1/4 cups chicken broth (as in another recipe I have used).  I was concerned that the pasta would become overcooked and mushie if I followed the recipe, so I simmered this uncovered for about 9 minutes; then stirred in the parmesan, basil, salt and pepper.  At this point it will appear a little soupy, but will absorb the extra liquid as it sits and cools.  I then reheat it in the microwave just before serving.  If using my method, obviously you'll need to make it ahead of time.  I'd even like to try making this a day ahead to see how that would work.  Great flavor.  Sautéing the orzo and using fresh basil make this recipe great!  Five stars all the way!!!

I always like making this as a side dish. It tastes lighter and fresher than most pasta dishes. I think it microwaves alright, just add a little more cheese after it comes out and wait a minute for the cheese to melt.

Fabulous! So easy & so tasty.  Great side dish for the family or even if you're trying to impress company. Other reviewers commented on it being "gummy", just add less parmesan. Usually people love parm. so they add more than needed.  Not necessary in this recipe.  Helpful hints: do not over brown the orzo, if anything under-brown it! Fresh basil makes all the difference too.  I just used some basil I had from last week & it wasn't nearly as fresh tasting as other times.

Interestingly, I thought we'd love this, but it was just ok. It was dry and sticky, and a bit bland even though I did add plenty of black pepper and salt, and used a high quality Parmesan. It's better warm than after it sits awhile, too, because the butter settles to the bottom and takes most of the flavor with it. Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT!  I followed some other hints and only added a fourth cup parm cheese.  Also, keep some extra ck broth on hand for the end.  I also shredded up a rotisserie chicken from the store and added at the last minute!  YUMMY!  Even my 8 and 6 year olds loved it.  Oh, and I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used 1 tsp. of dried and it was wonderful!

This was easy and great... I followed the recipe as written. Then only thing I noticed was that it was a *bit* dry... I read in later reviews that others added a couple more ounces of chicken broth. I will add that, as well as garlic, on the next go. Great recipe!

Totally fantastic! Instead of 1 cup orzo, I took a measuring cup and filled it half way with (approx.) 1 inch broken angel hair spaghetti pieces, and then topped it off with half a cup orzo (total 1 cup orzo/noodle pieces). This really gave it a rice-a-roni feel, which we loved! I used almost 10oz chopped spinach, and one tomato, diced. I kept in mind the reviews that mentioned dryness and added more chicken broth as needed. I added a tbsp garlic and a pinch crushed red pepper when it was simmering. I seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne. If you add veggies you have to season a little more. To top it off, I toasted some walnuts, chopped them and sprinkled them on top of each bowl. Amazing and so delicious, I can't wait to make again.

Just got done making it and WOW was it great. I always read reviews and am glad I did.  Used more chicken broth (16 ounces), and used less basil.  Burnt my tongue on the second "try it before you serve it" bite, because of course ONE try was so good I had to be sure it wasn't my imagination.  Excellent recipe.

I love cooking with orzo as a substitute for boxed rice and this recipe is by far the best I've had.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and served it with roasted pork tenderloin.  So simple, affordable, and delicious.  Definately a keeper at my house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was great!  It had a subtle flavor that won't overpower your main dish.  The kids didn't care for it, one said it was the "green stuff" he didn't like.  I bet if I had chopped the basil finer he wouldn't have even noticed.

My family has had this at least 10 times in the last year.  We do add fresh sauteed mushroons, and we find that we always have to add quite a bit more chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  My kids and my husband love it.

Really enjoyed-great flavor.  I had to add quite a bit more chicken broth.  Also wished I had used a little less basil-mine from the garden was a little overpowering. Added garlic and red pepper flakes and served with chicken breasts stuffed with provolone, artichokes and red pepper-can't wait for the leftovers!

Very good recipe.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and add sauteed baby spinach.  Great Idea.  Everyone loved it.

This was pretty good, however, I didn't have Basil, so I used fresh cut chives instead and it everyone liked it.  Next time I'll try Basil.

Kid-friendly:  serve theirs before adding basil.  Everyone loved it!  I used some lemon-infused olive oil from Oliviers and Co. to add a subtle hint of lemon.

I doubled the recipe and there was enough liquid to last til the orzo was done. I didn't let it boil for very long though, and when i turned it down low i really turned it down, so maybe this is why the liquid lasted? It turned out great, i added mushrooms to it as well.

I had never made orzo before, and this turned out perfect!  I was concerned that it would taste very buttery, but the flavor and liquid ratio was perfect!  This is a wonderful compliment to any main dish!

I was looking for a recipe with orzo because my mom bought me some and I had never eaten it nor cooked it before. And now this is my husband's favorite recipe I've ever made! We add chicken that I cook with Italian dressing. I let the chicken brown up a little and the Italian dressing to burn on the bottom of the pan and then add a little bit of water so the chicken can soak up all of the good drippings! We add that to the finished orzo, and it is outstanding! Many of my friends love this recipe now, as well! Thanks so much!

This was pretty good.  I would like to try it again with fresh basil and grated parmesan.  I think the recipe really needs the basil to give it a little something, otherwise I just prefer pasta noodles with a bit of butter!  Also, I only had a block of fresh parmesan, which obviously does not coat as evenly as the grated would.  A nice simple side, even my picky 3 year old ate it!

This was such an easy and delicious side dish to my Chicken Kiev tonight.  I tasted it before I added the parmesan cheese and I could have eaten the orzo just in the buttery chicken broth sauce, to be honest.  It was also delicious with the parmesan cheese and basil.  But it's nice to know that should you not have the parm or the basil, you can make a fabulous side dish with just the orzo, butter, and chicken stock.  Excellent!

OMG! This couldn't be any easier and so versatile!  I quadrupled the recipe for a party, added sauteed mushrooms with the cheese and basil. It tastes like a creamy risotto without the hastle. Next time I am going to add some sauteed or roasted garlic to it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I wasn't sure what to expect but this was very tasty!  I didn't have fresh basil so I just scooped out a few spoons of garlic pesto.  The orzo plumped up perfectly and we all enjoyed it immensely!  Next time I will be sure to use fresh parm though, the powder stuff isn't very good.  Thanks!  :-)

Deceptively simple ingredients come together in a delicious way. We make this very often- it makes a great side dish for just about anything. Great as leftovers, but also nice enough to serve when you have company (with a little fresh basil garnish). Have also made it with dried basil in a pinch, and it is pretty good, but I think it's the fresh basil that makes it. Great recipe!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Great!  Didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried.  Still really good.  I'm sure it would be amazing with fresh.  Also, didn't have parmesan, so I used Asiago.  Will definately make again.  The whole family loved it, including a 5 year old and 3 year old twins.  Thanks!

This was really good.  And really easy.  Perfect way to use fresh basil from the garden.  I added minced garlic to the butter.  Basil and garlic always go together.

I really enjoyed this dish. Although I didn't have any basil, I just threw it a handful of chopped italian parsley. It was so easy to make. I served it with lamb chops and steamed asparagus.

This was a huge hit at my house!! I used the whole box of orzo, therefore I adjusted the proportions accordingly. This was my favorite kind of dish, simple and delicious. I have used dried basil before when I did not have fresh and while it is not as good, it still gets completely devoured. This goes great will a simple Italian marinaded chicken or basically any chicken dish.

This is the best side dish I've ever made. It's a great budget meal since the orzo, chicken broth, cheese and basil cost me about $8 together. It's easy to make and hard to mess up. Every time I've made it, about twenty by now, it's come out wonderful. I even have guests asking for the recipe. If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I would.

Easy to make, few ingredients, and most importantly, delicious!  If you don't have fresh basil, only use half of what the recipe calls for. I will make this again.

Talk about a quick and easy side that is delicious too.  My husband raved about it on his way out the door to a meeting...know he will be looking for the leftovers..oops!  I didn't have fresh basil, so used dried sweet basil leaves (I know, doesn't do it justice, but all I had) and used shredded parm instead of grated, just a preference there.  I will be making this one often!

Outstanding side dish! I went a little nuts with the fresh basil but other than that, this dish has great flavor. I served it with a broiled grouper recipe from allrecipes and it was excellent. My husband and daughter enjoyed it and I will be making it again!

This was a winner all the way around. Quick, easy and very tasty. Even with just dried basil (which I rubbed/sprinkled over with the broth to give it a chance to cook in...) we enjoyed this a lot. Nice and creamy -- even after sitting on the warm back burner (timing was a bit off that night...). Love the tang of the parm. Served with salmon and green beans. Thanks for this recipe!

This was so good.  Used fresh basil from my garden.  Also, at the end, I did add some fat free half and half, because I accidentally let it get dry...I did add some dry white wine to the chicken stock when cooking the orzo.  Very good recipe. So easy.

This was an easy recipe to prepare and could work with just about any entree.  We liked it, but, it was a little bland for our taste.  I will definitely use this recipe again as a base, but, experiment with adding different ingredients to it for a little more flavor.

I love this recipe. Simple, tasty and ingrediants on hand and inexpensive.  I usually omit the basil (not a basil lover) and I usually add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream (regular or low fat) along with the cheese for a creamier texture.

This tastes yummy but the texture isn't great, and the leftovers are a dry sticky mess, even with added chicken stock the next day. Definitely worth a try, though!

Yummy, I used provolone because I didn't have good parm. It was great. I also added on minced clove of garlic. My kids even loved the dish. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Man! this was sooooo yummy. Although I changed a few things... My changes: I cut down on the butter to about ½ TBS and added a tsp. of olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic. Then I only had 10.5 oz. of chix broth so I did the other 4.5 ounces with white wine. The liquid absorbs way way faster than 15 minutes, so I burned it a little and it stuck to the bottom… whatever. Then I had fresh parsley so I added that and these frozen basil cubes from Trader Joes. I then sautéed mushrooms and pine nuts and added them to the orzo. Yummy!

I've made this several times, following the recipe exactly.  Excellent side dish - the whole family loved it.  Serve it as soon as it's done, since it will absorb the liquid and get gummy/sticky if it sits around for a while.

Elegant enough to serve at a dinner party. I sauteed the orzo with fresh garlic and it was awesome !
Definitely use fresh basil because dried basil will not do justice !

I sauted chunks of chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) in butter before browning the orzo and made it a one dish meal.  My husband loved it and the best part- I didn't need any extra pans!

Excellent....used 1 tblsp. butter and 1 tblsp. olive oil, followed exact instructions. Delicious! Loved the flavors of the parm and the fresh basil! Served this with my homemade Outstanding Grilled Basil Chicken Burgers (waiting for the publication to come through on this site...takes soooo long to publish a recipe). Will make again, very tasty and easy to make. Thanks!

Excellent and simple! I took the suggestions of some others and added a little minced garlic. Also, I used roasted garlic seasoned chicken broth.

This recipe is delicious.  This was the first time I'd ever cooked with orzo and it turned out great!  The only thing I changed was I added two garlic cloves (chopped) and the whole kitchen smelled great!

My family really liked this.  I keep cubes of frozen pesto in my freezer, so I used a cube plus some fresh basil.  Did not have chicken broth, so used beef broth (which went well with the rest of our meal).  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic.  This recipe goes in my big cookbook of favorites.  Thanks for posting it :)

I really liked this.  Easy to make, with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Will definitely make again and again.  I season the broth with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before adding the orzo.
*Note: I made this again for an impromptu BBQ and people raved about it.  It was the first thing gone and I adjusted the recipe to use a WHOLE BOX of orzo.  This is a KEEPER for sure.

One word for this recipe...YUM! I made it with whole wheat orzo and it was delicious! Husband loved it as well. I used half of the butter and low-sodium chicken broth. Enjoy!

I gave this a 5 because I am on a very low sodium diet and this was the first thing that I could actually eat.  I used low sodium chicken broth to reduce the sodium and man was this a treat!  Food has been pretty tasteless to me, so this was a pleasant surprise!  Thanks for the recipe... simple but good!

Very yummy. It was extremely easy to make and delicious. Very flavourful. Good as a side dish. It was a little too salty though..the first time I made it. I've repeated the recipe several times putting 1/2 the amount of chicken broth and substituting the other 1/2 with water.  Excellent!!

I really liked the flavor of the recipe. I like all the ingredients, too. It's just that this preparation didn't work well for me, and the final dish was so greasy that I really didn't care for it, although the flavors are theoretically good, they are bogged down in the icky buttery sheen. However, my husband liked it.

Excellent dish!  I never really knew how to prepare Orzo, but I will definately stick with this method!!  I used reduced fat cheese and light butter to reduce the calories a bit.  I also left out the basil.  It was yummy!!!

Great tasting side dish.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I used a couple tablespoons of dried basil (I made a 4X batch).  This goes great with Chicken Marsala.

Great recipe! I didn't have fresh basil on hand, & used about 2-3 tbspns of dry basil (depending on how big a fan of basil you are). 
The easiest side dish to throw together & compliments beef, chicken, pork, fish..you name it! Thanks!

Delicious side dish!  So easy to make.  This is the first time I've cooked with orzo, and I really enjoyed it!  I took some suggestions and added a clove of crushed garlic with the butter, and some light cream after cooking.  I didn't have fresh basil but dried basil tasted just fine.

THis recipe was delicious and easy! It was a hit.
I also sauteed spinach with garlic and added it. 
With or without the spinach added, this will go into my regualar meal rotation.

This is just a wonderful recipe! I really like orzo and basil, so how cout it miss? I read other reviews before I prepared it so added fresh garlic when melting the butter to and added some fresh tomato at the end of the cooking time.

I really liked this dish.  So simple to make, and very tasty.  My first time making orzo.  I forgot to add pepper at the end, but it was still great.  I served this with Italian Breaded Pork chops and a green salad.  It was a great meal!

I think I had the flame on too high, my orzo came out a little dry. But I salvaged it by slowly adding water and adding a bit more cheese. Still, the flavor was delicious, what with the basil and parm. Really tasty. Everyone still loved it. Next time, I'll make sure to keep the flame lower so the broth doesn't evaporate too quickly.

I make this for lunch about every other week. I LOVE IT! I've also made it for potlucks and just double (or triple) the recipe to feed a crowd. When basil is not in season I just use a teaspoon or so of dried basil. Tastes great - though fresh is the preference over here. - Oh and it holds up great the next day. Just zap it for a little bit in the microwave (not too long or else it gets oily) and enjoy. I also omit the salt and sometimes use a dash of pepper.

I didn't put the extra basil on top, but other than that, I followed the recipe as-is. The parmesan melted just fine, and the dish was tasty. My only complaint is to nix the salt (or add a tiny pinch) because I added a sprinkle and it tasted a bit salty at the end. This makes a good side dish, though I'm not sure it would hold up the next day for leftovers (too dry?).

I'd recommend shredded parmesan over grated as the grated cheese made this incredibly dry. The taste was good, but the dryness drew opinions from everyone who enjoyed it. More cheese... to help make this a creamy dish would have made it better.

I made this dish last night to go with a beef roast and it was a big hit. I didn't have fresh basil and substituted dried basil, which worked just fine. I've already been asked to make the dish again this weekend!

Spectacular!  No fuss, no time, no mess.  I did not have any basil, so I left it out.  I added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a 1/2 cup of fresh onion.  This is a regular side dish in my home.

This was good and the fresh basil was very pungent.  My only problem with it was that   as it got cooler it lost some of its taste.

This is great and oh so easy to make.  My husband says it reminds him of Mac and Cheese, I agree.  Although, it only takes me about 10-15 minutes to cook or less.

My family loved this!  I was really surprised!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a combination of oil and butter, instead of only butter.  I also used vegetable broth, fresh parmesan, and just a couple of pinches of fresh basil, not 1/4 cup.

My 8yo daughter even liked it, which was a BIG surprise.  She said she didn't like the basil in it, but she ate it anyway.  I'm definitely making this again!

Tasted good but a little heavy for my tastes...my husband loved it though.  Next time I think I will try the butter spray and maybe cut down on the amount of parmesan.  I used real shredded parm instead of grated...that might have made a difference too?

THIS IS AN EASY AND DELICIOUS RECIPE!  CUT THE BUTTER DOWN A BIT AND ONLY SIMMER FOR ABOUT 12 MINUTES FOR AL DENTE ORZO.  I OMITTED THE BASIL AND USED ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF PARSLEY INSTEAD.   I ALSO OMITTED THE PEPPER AND JUST SEASONED IT WITH GARLIC SALT.  MY KIDS REALLY ENJOYED IT AS A SIDE TO CITY CHICKEN!

This is a great recipe.  I have to admit that I didn't use the basil like a lot of other reviewers.  I added about 1/4 tsp of dried Italian seasoning and a good 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  It was spicy and delicious.  Oh, I also substituted dry white wine for approx. 1/4 of the liquid.

Fantastic dish!  I used parsley instead of basil for a lighter taste and used freshly shredded parmesan & romano cheeses.  I also substitued vegetable broth for chicken broth; less sodium.  Oh, c'est si bon!

Nothing spectacular about the flavor but a great recipe for something different. I served it with the Greek Souzoukaklia recipe on this site and both were a big hit with the hubby. will definitely be adding this one to my regular rotation of sides.

Great dish Dodie! Oh my goodness, so much you can do with this because orzo is so much like  pasta and rice. For more flavor I added garlic and onion powders and more parm then called  for. This could so easily be a complete meal by adding  broccoli, or any vegies you like and some chicken or beef. My kids had this as is and they absolutely loved it!

I make this often as a side dish - sometimes with the basil (a little less than is called for in the recipe) and sometimes without the basil.  It is good both ways and the kids eat it too!!

Awesome...just my kind of side dish and my husband and kids loved it! I've made orzo and rice (from this site) quite a bit, but this is a great cheesy alternative that I'll use a lot.

This is a quick and easy recipe, very tasty.
My husband is so hooked on this recipe, he asks for it all the time.  I pair it with chicken cutlets and some sauteed veggies.  A great compliment to any dish.

Yummy!!!  I doubled this recipe and served it as a side dish for about 20 people and it got rave reviews.  My grocery store did not have fresh basil, so I had to use dried, but it was still great.  I served with pork tenderloin and it was perfect.

This is one of my very favorite side dishes, I've made it many times.  It's good with fresh basil, or even with dried.  (Use less if it's dried, obviously!)

This was good, but it basically tasted like "Creamy Chicken" Ramen with extra cheese.  I liked it, but I probably won't make it again.

This is so easy to make and tasty! Both times I've made it I've added cooked chicken strips and heated all together at the end of the orzo cooking process. Smells good, too!

Great taste...I think it would go with any entree.
I used pesto sauce because I didn't have basil.  The garlic, olive oil, pine nuts and basil in the sauce gave it a great taste.

I made this to bring to a BBQ--everyone really liked it; even my 11 month old.  I added a cup of peas to the recipe and didn't have parmesan cheese so used romano.

Was very flavorful - next time I'll add a little extra water as my orzo got a little rubbery (broth boiled off when I added it, I think)

I substituted Roasted Garlic Chicken Stock and tossed in 1 dozen shrimp (cleaned, deveined & chopped) - would also be great with chicken added.  This made a fabulous and quick one-dish meal.

This was okay...but a bit of a boring dish. I wouldn't make it again. Also, it's really easy to burn in the orzo pasta if you let it get brown as the recipe suggests...far better to leave it yellow and have it stay a reasonable texture.

This is my go to recipe for orzo pasta. I have made this several times but I haven't made it using Basil yet.  I'll try it with Basil during the growing season.

One of my all time favorite side dishes!  I don't usually have fresh basil on hand but I almost always have homemade pesto (frozen in ice cube trays then kept in a ziploc bag.)  So instead of the fresh basil, I just stir in one cube of thawed pesto.  So delicious!

This has been a favorite in my family since I started making it.   I have to make a double or quadruple recipe every time and it still doesn't last long.  

I always use at least twice the basil.  In fact, my wife and I decided to start an inside herb garden in order to have enough fresh basil to make this recipe often.

Recently I've been adding cubed, skillet seared chicken thighs just before I add the basil and cheese.  It's fantastic.

One of the best things about this recipe is how it reheats in the microwave.   It tastes and feels just like fresh cooked.

What a perfect side!  We cut back on the Parmesan cheese by about 1/4, otherwise, made it exactly per the recipe and it was amazing!  Some sides just seem bland while others overpower the main dish but this one really is a perfect balance.  We had this with balsamic chicken and prince edward veggie medley.  This is just incredible.

Great idea that I tweaked to my preference. Made this the first time to the recipe and felt that it needed a little more oomph for creaminess. I would add some milk, heavy cream, or yogurt just to make it a bit more creamy. The second time I made this, I was having a migraine so was avoiding cheese. I made a half portion and did everything but cheese. I also added garlic powder, ground thyme, and chopped tomatoes (removing the seeds).  It was soooo good and went well with my sautéed chicken thighs. Next time I’ll add some onions while browning the orzo and I know that will take it to the next level.

This is delicious and easy! And you can mix in whatever you like, as others have noted. I like to brown the orzo well - golden brown or darker (!) but you can do it to your own taste. My kids don't all like the cheese so I leave it out and then grate it over the individual serving for whoever wants it. Yum!

I sauteed 3 T onion, 5 mushrooms and a small bag of fresh spinach, set aside.  I omitted basil all together.  Made recipe as written otherwise, mixed in spinach mixture.  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.

Excellent. I made it almost per the recipe the first time, with the addition of a little garlic and some frozen peas. Second time, I also sautéed the orzo with garlic. Separately I sautéed mushrooms, garlic, and asparagus. I combined the two and added a few cups of chopped baby spinach till just melted. I served with Parmesan on the side. Excellent. With vegetables added, it makes a lot, but it’s also a one pot vegetarian meal.

Great side dish easy to make. I did not add basil leaves, did include a couple shakes of Italian seasoning. The chicken broth gives it a great flavor. My kids asked for seconds on this.

I didn’t have fresh basil and I used a lemon infused oil to toast the orzo.  It’s a nice change from the usual dinner starches- will try it again with the fresh basil to see what it does to the flavour.

I love this recipe, of course with a few modifications. I like to saute shallots in the butter, then add the orzo. I also use chicken stock instead of broth, for more flavor. Fresh herbs are what give this such good flavor, so don't cheat yourself using dried basil.  It's so simple and pairs with so many things, and reheats well!

This recipe is the perfect combination of flavors. I used rice instead of orzo; I bet you could use most other pastas as substitute for the base. Not too heavy of a dish either; it tastes like a combination of sticky rice and risotto. It's nice not to have meat dishes for every meal and this is a good light alternative. You could probably even use vegetable stock and make it a vegetarian dish.

I love this recipe!  It has so much flavor!  I buy the box of chicken stock and use closer to 16oz.  I found just using the 14.5 wasn’t enough.

This is amazing.  The only thing I changed was to ADD diced up fresh mushrooms.  When browning orzo, I added the mushrooms.  My husband LOVES this and so do I.

I forgot to brown the orzo, but it turned out fantastic. Next time I will brown it first. I also used dried Basil that I had grown and did not use the whole 1/4 cup. I used grated Parmesan shaker cheese. Next time I will use fresh grated Parmesan and garlic.  It was so yummy!

Wow, so easy to cook AND clean up - and my picky parents loved it! They are meat-n-potatoes type of folks, for reference. I am a huge basil aficionado and it is SO HARD to get them to help me eat my huge harvests. I only added a touch of powdered garlic and minced onion, would absolutely add even more next time, but was lovely even as written. Will be making many iterations of this for years to come.

For any other basil lovers/growers, I used "Emily" basil which is a Genovese type, and Siam Queen Thai basil, in a 3:1 ratio to avoid overpowering the dish.

Amazingly simple and delicious side dish. I made it using a can of condensed cream of chicken soup (only thing I had on hand). I think because of that I ended up needing to add another 1/2 cup  to 3/4  cup of water because the pan started to dry up while cooking. Either way, I found this to be a very forgiving recipe as it still turned out wonderfully.

This was very easy to make.  It was tasty but I think that there was way to much cheese.  Next  time I make this I will use about 1/2 of the amount of parm. cheese.  It became very thick and to cheesy.  I added some water to make it more creamy instead of a thick dough.

This is better than using a Rice a Roni box of something or another. You do want to make sure & use fresh basil. We grow some every summer so this is when I'll make this the most cause even store bought isn't always as good as right out of the garden. My big pet peeve is the "grated parmesan cheese". Very seldom do you find a recipe that states if it is fresh or a container of dry parmesan. We used fresh & then dry putting some dry stuff on some. Hands down hubby & I both liked the fresh. It is hard to mix into the cooked orzo because it melts so fast but still will use the fresh & maybe more of it.

The final product didn’t have enough flavor for us.  I was excited to use basil from my own garden, but honestly wasn’t impressed with the dish.  I was really hoping to love it.

So good! The only changes we made to this has been adding meat: we have made this several times- by itself, with spam, with chicken, and with pork. It is so good every time we make it! The basil gives such a great flavor and the parmesan gives such a creaminess. YUM!

Made this exactly per the recipe, which isn't my usual. Didn't love the chunky basil. Would have been good, probably better with less basil. Otherwise, good flavors and combinations! Or I could see using some pesto if you have that, maybe some garlic and/or other tasty cheese...Will keep in my  box, just won't use as much basil next time.

The idea is good, but the liquid ratio to 1 cup of orzo is way off.  Orzo is like rice: 1 cup rice to 2 cups water.  The can of chicken stock was a dry, burning mess until I added an additional cup of liquid and more as it cooked.  The orzo survived and was pretty good and I will make it again with more broth.

So easy, so delicious, and it’s something different than rice or potatoes. I served it with roasted whole chicken and even the picky eaters at our house. I didn’t have the fresh basil so I used dried basil and it was still delicious

While I loved the simplicity of the recipe, I found it a bit dry.  Rather than serve as is I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and cooked for a few more minutes.  Perfect.

Lovely! I used tri-color orzo, and sautéed some garlic, onion, and mushrooms to add along with some chopped bacon. I might eat the entire batch. Sorry not sorry.

Cut in 1/2 for 2.  Was super easy to make. Served with blackberry salmon and fresh garlic green beans. I will make again.

We have a large family (10 in just our immediate family), and I've done a lot of cooking over the years.  I love turning to Allrecipes.com to try new things.  Normally, I try not to give recipes low ratings like this as I will tweak them a little to suit our family's tastes as needed and give it a higher rating.  As stated in other reviews, the amount of liquid (chicken broth), was nowhere near enough to ensure the orzo was cooked before it was absorbed.  I had to add a little more than half again as much just to keep it moist until the orzo was tender.  I added red onion, garlic and parsley, but the basil was overpowering and I didn't at all like the flavor of the parmesan in the recipe.  I won't make it again.

This recipe doesn't say when t remove it from he heat.  Do that right before you add the parmesan cheese.  Otherwise, the cheese will melt together and make a gooey clump.   This was a nice subdued side dish.  I'll make it again.

Came out great! My parents both loved it but my toddler wasn't so sure. Over browned it a bit but still tasted really good. I added some extra chicken broth after it was done so it wasn't so thick and dry and I thought there was a bit too much basil. Next time I think I will try adding less, I used 3 tablespoons and didn't add the extra basil on top. I also think I will omit the salt since the chicken broth already had plenty in it even with the 33% less sodium broth. Will definitely try again, thanks for sharing.

I used Garlic butter instead of regular butter. And, because I need veggies, I added frozen peas & corn at the end. Amazing. I will make this many times. Loved it. Can't wait to try it on visitors. Also I topped it with sauteed white fish. Yum.....

This was excellent.  I used gluten free orzo so I needed about 3 cups of chicken broth.  I made everything else as directed and loved it.  The family thought it was delicious.  This is like risotto without all the work.

Another great dish.  I added  a little chopped carrots, celery, red pepper and green onion, maybe 1/4 cup or so, with the orzo.  The amount of liquid was right on.  Real creamy.  Husband said he could make a meal of it.  Thank You.

This was wonderful. I did deviate from the recipe. I added two diced cloves of garlic to the butter before I added the orzo. I also added about 2 cups of frozen chopped spinach instead of basil when I added the broth. I found it necessary to add an additional half cup of broth to finish cooking the orzo. It got rave reviews. I will be making this again. It is a delicious side dish that is easy and quick to prepare.

Delicious! Based on what I had on hand and by suggestions made in other reviews, I did 1 T butter and 1T olive oil to sauté, 2 chopped/minced garlic gloves in with the orzo before adding the broth, which was 2 chicken bouillon cubes and water. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of nutmeg. It probably would've tasted very good without adding those few things, but in the end it was like a fantastic rice-a-roni!

1. I would make this as written without hesitation. 2. I made it with lime juice, tequila, green onion, garlic and manchego to go with tilapia and mango salsa. DELICIOUS.

Definitely a 5 star side dish.  Made this yesterday and my hubby had 3 servings.  Next time I would double the recipe due to this, lol!  Very tasty and used fresh basil from my garden.  I think sautéing the orzo gives it an extra "boost" of flavor.  Delicious

I followed the recipe pretty closely, I had a little more basil than 1/4 and topped my serving with additional parmesan.  I thought about adding garlic to the saute but it doesn't seem to need anything.  Great side for my grilled chops.

First time making orzo and it came out great! Love this recipe but I did make a couple of changes. I added chopped red onion and minced garlic to the recipe. Instead of chicken broth I used vegetable broth since I was making a pork sausage dish as the entree. Instead of basil I used parsley as a garnish. My husband loved it!

This was very yummy and easy to make. I had tons of basil from my garden, and had a bag of orzo and fresh chicken stock left.  The flavors were  great  I followed the recipe to the T. We had originally planned on adding pesto, but it was perfect as written.

This was tasty, I probably only used a third of the cheese called for since I was serving it with a very creamy chicken dish. My company was running late so I was able to keep this waiting by adding a bit of liquid periodically and waited to add the cheese until the very end. I had never made orzo before, but I would definitely make this again and try adding all the cheese for the full effect.

Followed to the letter. I was less than impressed. My son and husband both took a bite, and left it otherwise untouched as well.  A shame.

This was incredibly flavorful and a wonderful alternative to a rice side.  I has shredded parmesan so I put it in the mini-processor until it was more like grated parmesan.  I found that the orzo was done closer to the 15 minute mark.  This has been true both times I've made it.

This dish is absolutely AMAZING.   My family and I loved it, but I made only one small change.  For the chicken broth, I added 1 cup of chicken broth with white wine and herbs and almost a cup of regular chicken broth.  It just gave the orzo a boost of flavor that we really loved.  Other than that, no other changes.  This is now one of my most favorite side dishes.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  We will be making this often.

I like this because it is quick, easy, liked by all family members, and easy to adapt.  I sometimes use it as a side dish as is, I sometimes add chicken and broccoli and make it a one pot dish.  After the first time I made it I switched from beef broth to chicken broth for a bit more flavor.

This is awesome! Followed recipe exactly except used chopped fresh spinach instead of basil which I loved! Threw about 2 cups chopped into the pot with the chicken stock and let it cook with the orzo. Perfect! Will make again, esp for company!

This is my "go to" side whenever we have company over. It never disappoints. Everyone loves it. When I tell people that I am making it the first reaction is always "What is orzo" After they have tasted it, they always ask for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have basil, but did add sauteed mushrooms and cilantro pesto (we had a bumper crop of cilantro this year).  I also sauteed 2 garlic cloves with the orzo.

A very easy recipe to make.. It's not something I'd make on a regular basis but in a time crunch or wanting something different it checks the boxes. I would also recommend adding more cheese as the suggested amount really didn't changer the flavor all that much. I may try adding sauteed mushrooms or spinach the next time I try it.

Five stars for it's simplicity that results in big flavor.  I've made this several times and have two hints:  check the orzo at least half-way through cooking, as you likely will need more chicken broth than one can.  Secondly, you can cut the fat slightly by using one tablespoon of butter without a big sacrifice in flavor or creaminess.  Just be sure you use a large enough skillet so the orzo can brown in a single layer.

My fresh basil had gone bad so i used a little bit of dried basil. Otherwise I made this exactly as directed (doubled to serve 4)
My 10 year old was not a big fan but I give it a 5 for how quick, easy and cheap it was to make. Also a lot healthier than the salt loaded premade bag types. This was very tasty, next time I will experiment and add things to it, maybe mushrooms.

I have made this many times and we love it exactly as the recipe says.  it is also very good with dried basil for those times that fresh isn't available.  Last night, however, I tried a slight variation that turned out better than the original in my opinion.  i was making Pork Tenderloin Diane from this site and it uses lemon pepper and lemon juice so i decided to try to 'lemonize' my orzo as well.  I used half lemon olive oil and half butter in the pan then added the chicken broth and a spoonful of pureed garlic.  As my pork wasn't quite ready I added the basil and a good shake of lemon pepper to the orzo and let it cook a bit more.  When the pork was done I added the cheese to the pan.  Hubby was a huge fan of this variation also.

Wonderful basic recipe. For variety I add a can of chopped green chilies and half a chopped red pepper. Love this versatility.

Nice for change of pace from potatoes. The orzo cooked like rice, need to keep an eye on it.

I love this recipe.  I must have made it 10x since I found it.  If it is summer, fresh basil--otherwise, dried.  Usually use "Better than instead of canned broth.  I could eat just this for dinner and skip the main dish!

I have made this countless times as a side dish that is "different" from traditional.  Hubby loves it...and so do I.  I usually make it without basil.  I have added mushrooms, onions...and made it plain.  Very versatile recipe.

Made just as written, well, OK, used more cheese because well, more cheese is always better.  I did make with good Parmesan, a solid hunk, grated it and mixed in.  I think you need good cheese for this!

I like this dish.  I used vegetable broth.  It tasted a little bland so I added some hot pepper flakes.  A good solid side dish.

I like it as written- maybe add a bit of garlic :). But what I most often do is add two boneless chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces to make this a main dish. Tonight I'm trying  to add some salmon.

Loved this recipe,  I cooked the orzo like the recipe said except I sauté the orzo in olive oil instead of butter.   I sauté chopped mushrooms and add them to the cooked orzo, along with the basil and cheese.    So good.   My husband loved it too.

I liked this recipe because who doesn't like bits of pasta with cheese and butter.   I didn't have any basil on hand but I did have frozen mixed vegetables.  I added about a cup.  I thought this would be a perfect substitute and it was.  I kept mixing this like I was making a risotto so that it wouldn't stick.  I also added some additional chicken broth by eye until I got the texture I was happy with.   I definitely will make this again.

Wow! What an an  easy dish.  It will become a regular!   I doubled the recipe, and added 1 clove of crushed garlic while browning the orzo.  Added mushrooms and frozen peas at the the end.  Rave reviews.

I was looking for a side dish to make and Orzo came to mind. Too often I forget about Orzo but lately I am trying to change my menus around to make them more diverse and this dish fits the bill as well as being very easy to make that taste pretty good as well.

I did not have a can of chicken broth instead I used just under 2 cups water and about 3 tbsp of Better than Bouillon chicken, because I love the taste of this. You would probably not have to use this much bouillon. I loved it and will make it again, It was a perfect side to homemade shake and bake chicken!

Yummy!! Used 2 1/4 cups of stock, cause we like our Risotto "loose" and this is like cooking rice, to me. Used block of Parmesan for grating. Made Spinach Pesto from this site, added a 2 tablespoons of Pesto at the end of cooking Orzo. Did NOT add chopped basil, although, you could!

Very easy to prepare and delicious!  I did not have a problem with it being greasy, as some others did.  Fresh basil is a must in this dish, I don't think it would be as good with dry.  Add a little more broth if it is too sticky, or if you are not serving it right away.  I had to add more broth twice at the end to prevent it from drying out, while the rest of the meal finished cooking.  I will definitely make this again and again.

So good! This was my first ever experience with orzo pasta, and I am impressed. Even my husband (who is SUCH a picky eater) went back for seconds! If you like a lot of basil flavor, you may want to consider adding a little more than what is called for. But we thought it was perfect!

Outstanding side dish.  I substitute parsley for the basil (not a fan of basil) and go slightly under on the Parmesan cheese.  Do NOT  skip browning the orzo in butter.  It gives it a wonderful color and a delicious nutty flavor.  Beautiful and tasty side dish!

Whoever said this lacked flavor clearly ate a tray of ice cubes just prior because this was a flavor explosion! SO easy to make and a huge hit.  Like others I 86'd the basil.  Added 1/2c sautéed mushrooms, no salt/pepper, and used Kerrygold butter. Oh and chicken stock, not broth (I didn't have any). This made it to my go-to recipe book ... Easy and delicious.

Tasty! Would be interesting to try this without the basil also. For our family (2 adults), 6 sgs = 4 individual meals. Served with chicken marsala.

Quick, simple, and tasty. My 2 year old and my husband both really enjoyed this. It's easy enough you can prepare other food while it simmers. I didn't, but it would be easy enough to add some Mediterranean themed veggies.

I added ~ 4-5 Tablespoons of diced sundried tomatoes (my husband's favorite) to the orzo while cooking.  Then I added the Parmesan and basil per the recipe. He LOVED this recipe.  Went perfect with baked salmon with a balsamic maple sauce.

Perfect side dish or add a protein and extra vegetables. I had to add more chicken broth as it was drying up after 7 minutes. I added broccoli that I steamed on the side.

I make this all the time and add sautéed spinach and mushrooms in at the end. It's absolutely delicious. I usually add a bit more chicken broth but otherwise I follow the recipe.

This was a great side dish! I sautéed some chopped almonds in the butter for a nice added crunch. The consistency turned out perfectly with the ingredient amounts exact to the recipe... it was not at all sticky or mushy. Will definitely make this again!

Simple and Delicious! Didn't have chicken broth but had boullion cube. Works perfect. Just boil 1 cup of water per one cube. Thanks for this great side dish recipe. You can be creative and do do many variations.

Was very easy to make, and my family (picky kids included) loved it. Easy to change the flavors, too, simply by changing the herbs or cheese, and even adding chopped veggies if wanted.  Great, simple, versatile recipe.

I added a Tbs of finely chopped onion when sautéing the garlic. Didn't have any fresh basil, but did have some pesto and put about 2 Tbs of that in. So good! Hubby loved it. Served with grilled salmon and asparagus. Thanks for sharing!

As others have suggested, I did half butter/half olive oil. Also used veggie stock and added in about a cup of sun-dried tomatoes. Red/green dish is great for holiday parties. Tastes even better after sitting a day.

Whenever I make this orzo recipe it disappears. And it goes with everything, chicken, fish, steak. A perfect side dish to have in your rotation.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make!  I've made it several times, most recently with tri-color Orzo because I happened to have a jar of it on hand.  I didn't change a thing, except I didn't garnish with additional basil leaves.  Last time I made it, I served it with quick chicken piccata from this site and a side of broccoli.  It was a hit!

What an easy & delicious recipe! Add a little wine with the broth & some saffron in the end with the basil & parmesan to kick it up a notch or two!

This is my first time cooking a dish with orzo in it, and I loved how it turned out! I could only think of one four letter word for it and that's YUMM!! The only change I made was using dried basil leaves instead of fresh. We didn't happen to have any on hand right now. It still turned out delicious though. I even went back for seconds. I couldn't imagine it being any better :) It has a great flavor to it. I will be making this again.

This recipe would be a 5 star recipe except that I think it needs a few additions to really make it great. I have made it as the recipe states and then doctored it up on my second try. It was much better the second time around. 

1. saute chopped garlic and onion with the orzo in the beginning
2. add dried basil and sliced mushroom while the orzo simmers in broth
3. add chopped spinach (or whatever veggies you prefer)when you add the cheese and basil at the end

What I did was heated the chicken broth before and then added still hot so it cooked way faster.

Amazing and easy! I made this as a side dish for another recipe found on this site (tender Italian baked chicken) and both were fantastic. The only thing I did was triple the recipe to have leftovers and added sun dried tomatoes. So good.

I tried this recipe last night and I loved it. I didn't have any chicken stock, so I used the beef stock I had and it was excellent. I had no basil either, so I used some mixed colored chopped peppers that I had instead. It was easy to make, plus I followed what someone else recommended about using 2 cups orzo and 3  cups stock, and that was very good. I will be making this a weekly meal for me.

Totally delicious! I was out of orzo so I made it with elbow macaroni and followed the same basic directions keeping an eye on when the pasta became soft. I could eat the whole bowl myself but I will restrain myself somehow!

My favourite type of dish. Simple and delicious. My family asked when we can have it again. The toasted orzo is a nice touch.

Simple and delicious.  Not too much salt, but just enough flavor.  The key is to use good parmesean, and not overcook the orzo.  thanks!!

Made this tonight, to serve alongside Barbeque Chicken, also from this site. This was a very quick and easy side recipe. Followed exact directions. My husband said he loved it. My kids, 4 and 6, didn't care for it, probably because of the basil. I really enjoyed this super simple, inexpensive, and tasty side dish! Will definitely make again...Thanks!

The orzo turned out perfectly cooked.  I didn't add salt and pepper to the dish b/c paired it with chicken breasts in caper cream sauce recipe which I found on this site.  Made for the perfect pair.

This was an excellent dish, I always read the reviews but try to keep it the way its originally written. I did take one reviewers advice and added the sauteed mushrooms and spinach simply because I had them and wanted to use them up. Will definitely be making this again.

The pictures here look waxy and chewy and don't do the recipe justice!  It came out really creamy and savory, and even better after adding sauteed spinach and mushrooms as the top comment suggests.

Unbelievable! This starch side dish stole the show. My husband and 2 teenage boys were fighting over the last bits in the bowl. I used only 3/4 cup of grated Parm blended with Romano. Also added some chopped baby spinach for visual interest. This recipe will definitely join my rotation.

Excellent base recipe but I made a few modifications. Two chicken breasts coated with Italian breadcrumbs and sautéed. A little less Parmesan to prevent dryness. Add almond slivers, diced red bell pepper and red onion, and rehydrated sun dried tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious. This is one of the only recipes on this entire website that is 100% spot-on. Usually the recipes are good but need a bit of tweaking. This one, however, is perfect and produces a fantastic side to any meal.

This was so easy and pretty good. My 7 yo loved it. I can see this getting made fairly regularly around our house. I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did accidentally put in 2/3 cup of parmesan instead of 1/2 - was multi-tasking and didn't realize what I had done until cleanup.

Had this last night and we loved it. Unfortunately I didn't have fresh basil and had to substitute some dried Italian spices but can't wait to try it with the fresh herbs this summer.

I made this twice and forgot all about the parmesan and basil.  I mixed sausage and spinach to it and it was pretty amazing, in my opinion.

Liked it, but followed the recipe exactly and it got a little clumpy when all mixed together.   I cooked it at the minimum cook time and noodles were soft.  I may try adding a little water next time.  And there will be a next time because the taste was very good.

I had never made orzo before, but really wanted to give it a try. Was worried this would be very difficult to get correct, without over/under cooking or drying out. It turned out DIVINE! My boyfriend came home from the grocery store with a surprise one night- live lobsters! They were on sale. So we needed to throw something together quickly to have with them. I had already bought the orzo in anticipation of trying this recipe, and we have a fresh basil plant. The ingredients are so minimal that it's something you can always have on-hand! I added some sauteed mushrooms, onion and spinach to give our meal some veg. You could literally add anything you like to this dish! Threw in some extra spices- dash of nutmeg, red pepper flakes, garlic powder. Family requested this to be in our regular rotation now!

Great recipe.  I add chicken so it's a main dish.  I sauté with Italian seasoning, put it to the side to toast the orzo and then add it back in and follow the recipe as stated.

OH SO YUMMY .... I did not have any fresh basil and i put some dried basil in the mix about 5 minutes before done.  I wanted the basil to soak up some of the chicken broth and it tastes just fine.  I also added a little garlic powder (love garlic) and it seemed to give it a bit more of an italian flavor to it.  Next time i think i will finely dice up some onion and garlic to add to it!

This recipe was awesome! It was super easy to make and I made it as a side to the garlic chicken recipe I found on here. The taste of the fresh basil in it was probably my favorite part, it really made it refreshing and more than just cheese in pasta. I will definitely be making this recipe again and I don't think I'll change anything from the original recipe.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I did have to use rice instead as our store did not have Orzo anywhere. :(  Instead of using canned chicken broth, I made my own from gizzards I had in the freezer.

Delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and added sauteed spinach and mushrooms. And maybe a tad more parmesan. :) So yummy!

I took the suggestions from other reviewers and sautéed garlic, mushrooms, peppers and zucchini in olive oil, added home-made chicken broth and a mix of orzo/Israeli couscous. I used 1 cup of broth to 2/3 cup of orzo but could have used a bit more broth. I put Parmesan in at the end and about a tablespoon of pesto. Delicious! Thanks for the inspiration!

Wow- this was amazing.  I skipped the fresh basil because I'm not a huge fan, and added a little garlic but this was amazing.  My very picky 3 year old devoured hers and asked for more.  I'll definitely be making it again.

Made this as written except omitted salt and used beef stock instead of chicken.  Pretty bland as is BUT wonderful side for braised short ribs with all the delicious juices on the orzo.  I concur with other reviewers--I had to add more stock and I watched it carefully the last 10 minutes.  Move over soft polenta--I've found my new favorite side dish.

I loved this and so did my kids. To make this a full meal I cooked some chopped boneless skinless chicken thighs in a pan with some oil and garlic powder and black pepper, then set chicken aside and threw in half a bag of fresh spinach and sauteed until wilted, and when the orzo was done cooking I just threw in the chicken and spinach and didn't need any extra salt (the broth and parm cheese add enough salt). I also omitted the step of cooking the orzo in butter first. I just dumped the broth, butter and orzo in the pot altogether and it was great. I used about 2 1/2 cups broth though, otherwise it would have gotten too thick and burned on the bottom.

LOVE this recipe! I follow it exactly... usually and have zero complaints, but, I recently added chopped garlic while sauteing and it's delicious that way too.  I plan on doubling  the recipe to bring to a BBQ/Pot Luck some day.  Try It! YuM

Simple and delicious.  Fresh basil was wonderful.  I simmered it on the lowest heat for almost 30 minutes.  It sat for 10 minutes while the rest of the meal cooked, so it stiffened up a bit.  I stirred in a little butter and olive oil to make it creamy again.  I will definitely make this again, and I'll try it in the camper.

I was looking for an orzo recipe that included basil in its preparation, since my basil plant is in total bloom.  This recipe was wonderfully flavorful, it went well with lightly sauted fish filets.  Even my picky teenage kids loved it.

This is so delicious! I have made this several times and my husband says it is amazing every time and my 3 year old told me it was yummy.  I do add sautéed garlic, spinach and mushrooms to it after simmering the orzo.

I used less butter. Threw in some chicken sausage and peas and just sprinkled in some dried basil since I didn't have any fresh. Yummy!

Awesome, easy, quick side dish that goes with all kinds of different things.  It is a lot better tasting when you cut the butter in half though...I can honestly say that is probably the first time I've ever even had such a thought, but it's true.

I make this often, it is easy, fast and cheap! (Important, my husband and I are both unemployed). I usually make it as written but have used dried basil when my basil plant is depleted or I'm feeling lazy.

This is now my family's favorite mac and cheese type dish ever. So creamy and cheesy! I don't like it much with orzo, I usually make it with shells or another small pasta.

My kids absolutely love this and always ask for seconds. (We adults like it, too!)  I have made it as-is and have also stirred in some homemade pesto which gives it some extra flavor.  Yummy!

DELICIOUS! I had never even heard of Orzo until I found a box of it in my pantry...curious on the how to's, I googled it and came across this recipe. For a first-timer, I'm pretty impressed with how easy it was to make. This is a FAST cooking recipe and it's so delicious. This has become a weekly menu item in our house.

This is an excellent recipe!  I have made it many times in the past year since I found it and everyone loves it.  I made it exactly as written the first few times, but have recently changed a few things because of dieting.  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light instead of butter and 1/4 instead of 1/2 cup of parm cheese and it's just as delicious!

AWESOME! Made as written, but used Grana Padana (sp?) in place of the parmesan because I love it and I had some on hand. This will definately be a staple in our house! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect.  I made it just as written.  I had plenty of fresh basil picked fresh from my garden.  It was a perfect side dish. My 8 year old son had 3 helpings.  In my opinion, the basil is essential.   The flavor of the fresh basil added so much to the parmesan and made it so flavorful.

LOVE this recipe. This is the second time I made this. The first time I used dried basil because I didn't have fresh basil on hand. This time I made it with fresh basil and it made the world of difference! SO good. Also at the last minute I decided to throw in my some sun dried tomatoes, really glad I did :)

Delicious!! I made the recipe exactly as stated, only subbing vegetable broth for chicken as we're vegetarians. I had no problem with the liquid cooking up too fast, I had my stove set between the low and medium low settings and the timing was perfect, about 18 minutes. Delicious, fast and easy! Will make over and over again!

As written, I was disappointed with the recipe. First, it does not make enought for 4 servings. I had to rush to make a second batch to have enough for 4. Second it took longer than 20 minutes to cook, to make sure the orzo was not hard. I ended up doubling the butter, orzo, broth and salt and pepper but not doubling the cheese and basil. It tasted good but I did not like that i trusted that the recipe as written made 4 servings.

Absolutely wonderful dish!!!! Very tasty, very very good. I practically licked my plate clean. Very simple ingredients, all worked together very well in this dish. I loved that this just had fresh basil and parmesan cheese mixed together in a light fluffy pasta. I made just enough for two people tonight and we were happy thou I wished I had more. I served the orzo with "grilled shrimp scampi", from this website, and two complemented each other perfectly!!! Yum yum.

This was REALLY delicious and very easy!  I actually only made it for one since I was alone for dinner that night, and I was wishing I had made the whole amount.  So good, but I did need to add more chicken broth, so I suggest checking your orzo after 10 minutes to see how fast the broth is evaporating.  I actually used chicken stock instead of broth, from a box.

Delicious.  Also combined this recipe with the Orzo and rice recipe from this site. A very big hit! Dresses up a simple meat dish.

I've been making this for several years.  Everyone in the family loves it and it is such an easy side dish.  I often make it a day ahead for a BBQ and serve it at room temp as a side.

Delicious!  This is a perfect summer side dish because it is so light and fresh tasting.  Will definitely make again.  It is also very easy.  I often used dried herbs in recipes, but I would definitely recommend using the fresh basil in this recipe.  I used EVOO instead of the butter.

Amazing! Just doing what the directions say is great. I have varied by putting the salt and pepper just as the chicken broth begins to simmer...adds a bit more flavor to the Orzo itself. :D so happy I found this.

OMG this was out of this world!!!!! Make sure you use fresh basil.  Maybe it tasted soooo good after a bottle of wine? (just kidding).  Try it you'll like it.

Really good side dish! I added a clove of grated garlic to it when browning the orzo and it came out great. I made this dish 2 days ago and my daughter asked me to make it again today, and she is a picky one. Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Until now I have only used Orzo in soups, but as a side dish this recipe was a hit with the family. I didn't have to change a thing, very fresh tasting. I used the fresh basil from my garden. Very nice side dish.

I made this exactly how the recipe called, except I completely forgot to add salt and pepper. No need for it though, because the flavor was amazing. At first I thought it was way too much cheese because it was really gooey trying to mix everything together, but after letting it cool the flavor and consistency turned out perfect! I will be making this dish again. Very tasty and really easy to make.

Margarine for butter, bouillon cube + water for the stock, much more basil and Parmesan/Asiago blend instead. Made the rest of the recipe as described. Not too cheesy for us, it was DELISH.

I made this, and my fiance and mother loved it. I feel that it would have been amazing for me, had I not cut the basil up myself. After smelling all the basil together, it was overwhelming and made me a little sick when I went to eat it.
However, I used bullion cubes instead of canned broth, and when I tasted it before the basil and parmesan, thought it needed an extra cube.
Next time, I'm going to use mushrooms and the bottled spice basil instead of fresh.
it was really good!

We've made this several times now and really enjoy it.  I haven't had fresh basil yet, so I add 1 T. dried to the broth, and it's delicious!  Sometimes we also throw in a little wilted spinach--very good!

I would give it five stars, but I think this is a bit much butter. I'd probably reduce it by about 1/4. Otherwise, this is a great side dish that I highly recommend. (I made the mistake of using parsley instead of basil, because I had parsley that I had to use up. I don't recommend that substitution--this clearly would be better with basil. I'm not factoring this into my rating.)

Fabulous.  I added sauteed mushrooms and spinach.  I added extra chicken broth as needed.  No fresh basil on hand, so I used dry leaves.  Also, I thought I had orzo on hand, but didn't; I had arborio rice.  Even though I didn't follow the recipe hardly at all, the result was still awesome.  I will definitely be making this again as written - no add-ins - with all of the right ingredients.

Yummy! Very simple to make and a nice change from potatoes on the side.  I added a dash of garlic powder towards the end. I also used parsley instead of basil because it went better with the fish I was cooking. This recipe definately has room to be customized to any dish you are cooking. Update: lost some of it's flavor when reheated the next day for lunch.

SUPER simple! I cooked it about a half hour in advance of everything else being ready, and it turned out fabulous! In retrospect, I should have added garlic when I was sauteeing the orzo with butter. A cheap and cheerful side everyone loved!

This recipe was amazing and very easy! Fresh basil is absolutely essential, so make sure you use it. I found that 1/2 cup of parmesan was too much though. I used about 1/3 cup and it was still very cheesy. It tasted like fancy macaroni and cheese! I would definitely make this again and again. Just make sure to keep an eye on it and stir it occassionally so the orzo doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.

Only one problem with this recipe - you HAVE to double it because there will be no leftovers or even seconds!! Absolutely delicious, and open to many variations - I added some garlic, but stuck to the rest of it exactly. I served it with chicken parmesan and steamed broccoli. My family scraped their plates clean.

I loved it.  I used whole wheat orzo, and the fresh basil and parmesean was a wonderful flavor addition to the nuttiness of the orzo.  I couldn't stop picking at it after dinner, it was that good.

This turned out delicious!  It was so quick and easy, I can see making this as a side dish all the time.  I added a little bit of minced garlic and didn't have fresh basil on hand so put in about 2 tbsp chopped frozen cubes.  Everything turned out fantastic!

Amazing! I made this today,it's super easy and quick to make! I'm not really one for measuring,I like to just add to taste but I did measure the orzo,and broth. I eye balled on the cheese and basil and added some salt. Wonderful recipe!...I ate it by itself but it would be wonderful as a side to just about anything!

I've made this before when I didn't have any basil and it was very good.  I've been growing basil in my garden lately and used it in the dish as directed and it was awesome!  The perfect balance!

Very good recipe and very flavorful.  The next time I make it, though, I think I'm going to try it with a little less basil and add a pinch of garlic powder.  Overall, enjoyable and easy to make!

This recipe is very easy and absolutely delicious. The secret is really browning the orzo in the pan until all of the orzo are toasted. My version of this recipe is composed of just butter, olive oil, orzo, and stock. It turns out divine without the cheese. I would add 1/2 cup of hot stock toward the end of the cooking process to add moisture.

I was looking for a quick tasty side dish.  Unfortunately I didn't have fresh parmesan or fresh basil, so I crossed my fingers and decided to try dried basil and powdered parmesan.  I added a can of mushrooms (was out of those fresh too, can you say 'time to go grocery shopping!")  I followed anothers advise and sauteed a clove of fresh garlic with the pasta and tossed in two spoonfuls of sourcream along with some grated marble cheese.  It was delicious!  Even my husband enjoyed it!  Will definately make again, hopefully with the fresh ingredients!  Easy recipe to adjust and improvise according to taste - Higly recommend adding this recipe to your recipe box!!

This was so tasy! I modified it a little bit by using dried oregano and basil.  I added them in the beginning with the butter so they combined better.  My fiance and I love this recipe :).

Delicious! My only addition would be to add black sliced olives about five minutes before it's done. Seriously, you want the olives! I cooked artichoke chicken and this dish for a little mediterranean theme and the two are great together. Definitely one of my favorite meals. My boyfriend cleans his plate every time!

YUM! So simple, so delicious! I did add a diced portabella mushroom for a little extra something and a little more stock, but other than that I made as described. I served as a side dish, and was sneaking bites of the leftovers when I put it away.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some more liquid. I didn't add the Parmesan (oops, I added it to my chicken by mistake) and it was really good, there were no leftovers. I will definitely try this again with the Parmesan.

This was a quick and easy dish to make.  I only give it three stars because although it was good, it was definitely not something to write home about.  Would I make this dish in the future?... probably every once in a while, but it will definitely not go into my favorite recipe rotation!

I only give this 4 stars as I think it was a bit cheesy - both kids who love pasta and cheese commented that but the husband loved it and I didn't have a problem with it either so its a toss up.  A great side dish - served it with the "pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls" that I found on this site and a green salad and it was a fabulous meal.

The only thing bad I can say about this is it didn't make enough!!  This recipe is a keeper! I made it with sauteed fresh spinach as one poster suggested and I served it with the Pork Marsala recipe on this website!

I love this recipe. I have found that I have to use almost twice the amount of chicken broth though. Very tasty. Even my kids will eat it!

This was pretty good, even though I had to use dried basil. My orzo scorched and a good bit of the pasta was stuck to the bottom of the pan. so next time I will watch the time and temp more closely. As an afterthought, this might be nice jazzed up with some chopped walnuts.

Great! I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, and I didn't add any basil because I'm not sure my 10 month oldwould eat it. It was still great! Next time I'd like to uyse fresh parmesan and add basil.

Good.  I only used a little bit of basil to get my children used to it, but it was good.

This was my first try at Orzo and it was so easy and so very delicious.Mine did not take 15 minutes to cook. In fact after about 8 minutes it was beginning to stick a little so be careful.

Four and a half stars. Very light, mild flavor that we found delicious. Followed the recipe pretty closely - used fresh finely chopped basil at the end, adds great depth to the dish. We'll definitely be making this again. UPDATE: 12/20 - okay, this has to be upgraded to five stars. It's just that good. I've made it lots of times now, and it is the one thing we keep eating, even when full. Really love this recipe for ease of preparation and delicious, gourmet-tasting results. Thank you.

This was so good, I would make it for dinner guests! I did make some changes because of what I had on hand, but I'm sure it would be great as written too. I didn't have any orzo, so I used rice, and sauteed minced garlic and chopped onions with the butter/rice mixture. Next time, I'll try it with orzo.

Simple, tasty, and a big HIT with my son who is a very selective eater. I'd change nothing except I'd double the recipe because this 4 serving recipe is small. I was worried it would not be enough for two adults and a child. Will be making this again and again!!

I liked this recipe but made some slight changes.  First I used EVOO instead of butter to which I added fresh minced garlic.  Only used about 1 T of parmesan and also added 1 diced plum tomato.

D. LISH. So simple, so yummy! Hubby agreed (and so did our 2 yr old) that this was delicious! Didn't need salt and pepper (found that it was salty enough from the butter and broth). I did add some garlic, but I think it wouldn't make a difference adding it or not, since the garlic flavor wasn't very strong, so next time, I will make this recipe to the T! The best!

Delicious! My only changes were that I doubled the recipe and added 3 cloves of garlic when I browned the orzo. We had company over and everyone loved it and everyone grabbed seconds, even a picky 10 year old! I served it with roasted chicken, broccoli, and a big ol green salad.

Absolutely delicious!  I served it as a side dish, and it stole the show from the main dish :) Because I was hustling to throw something together at the last minute, I used these suggestions from previous reviewers: added pesto instead of fresh basil & chopped tomatoes.  Too bad there are no leftovers!

Loved this recipe!  For those that have noted that the pasta is a little thick or clumpy toward the end of the cooking process, I remedied this by adding a little more chicken broth until desired consistency is reached and let warm through.  This will result in a nice, creamy texture and you can control how done the pasta will get.

My go to recipe when I need a side-dish that can be a real crowd pleaser or when I have an abundance of basil in the garden. At times I've deviated from the recipe; I will sautee fresh chopped garlic and onion with the orzo and then towards the end of cooking add saute'd frish sliced mushrooms.

A dash of pepper and salt at the end is a must, but other than that, it was fantastic! Will make again :) It definitely wasn't "too cheesy" either, and I will try to make it with mushrooms next time.

I gave it 5 stars because it turned out quite good, despite me goofing up on the measures.  I used double the broth than called for and of course, caught it on time before the orzo went to complete mush.  I also added a few other items: parsley, chopped grape tomatoes, some feta and some fine diced yellow pepper.  I know, I know - for those who don't like ratings and comments when we didn't follow the recipe exactly, I took some 'license' on this one and it turned out quite lovely!

So good! I added a turkey burger (browned and cut into pieces) to the orzo and broth before it was all absorbed.  I also used homemade veggie broth instead of chicken.  It was so great!

This is an awesome recipe.  I bought some whole wheat orzo and wasn't sure what to do with it and then I found this recipe.  I added some fresh diced tomatoes to it and it was out of this world.  I couldn't believe something this good came out of my kitchen!

MMM MMM YUMMY! I used 1/2c orzo 1/2c long grain white rice, and sauteed 1 clove garlic with the orzo. The parm and basil are a good combo for this dish. very tasty.

This recipe is amazing!  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband, my 5 yr old, my 16-month old and myself loved it so much we practically licked the bowl.  The only thing we substituted was smartbalance instead of butter!  Great recipe...Thanks!

My husband absolutely loved this!  I had my mom bring me some orzo on her last trip out here, as we can't find it here, and it was my first time cooking it.  Turned out great and now hubby wants more!  I'll have to find somewhere to order it online!  I also sautéed and added a bag of spinach like one reviewer suggested and that was wonderful.  Thank you!

Thought this recipe was a great side dish. Not overly flavorful, which was a fabulous compliment to the Florentine Chicken recipe from this site. The only thing I added was 1/2 can diced artichoke hearts because I had them on hand, but it would be great without too!

Good overall base receipe that is very flexible and can easily be tailored to suit your taste. I omitted the basil and would go lighter on the parmesan in the future since it was a bit much for me and I am usually a fan.

I made this for lunch yesterday and served it with basil cream sauce. This was quite a hit! I added a clove of garlic along with the tomatoes and basil and used rotini and orzo. Tastes like summer. Next time I'll stir in some fresh tomatoes at the end.

This recipe is delicious.  If you want to have some more fun with orzo, season it with chipotle paste instead of basil.  Stir in cheese of choice.  To make chipotle paste, take one can of chipotles in adobo & puree until smooth.  Keep in a jar in the frig.  Use per your taste to season with.  If you like things spicy use a lot and vice versa if you like subtle seasoning.

This is good!  I didn't use fresh basil, or any basil for that matter, only because I didn't want it.  I added more broth towards the end because the pasta absorbs most of it, especially after adding the parmesan.

So many people have reviewed this...but I agree, it's a 5 star!!!  Every time I make it, it's gone instantly.  I've also shared it w several friends and co-workers.  Last night I baked a ham and sauteed asparagus.  Today for lunch I cut those up and put it in the left ovre orzo.  DELICIOUS!  This is a dinner staple.

Loved this- made it 'as is' and practically licked my plate.  If you added more cheese it could be a grown up mac and cheese substitute.

The flavors are good and it is easy to make. Needs more liquid halfway through cooking and add cheese slowly to avoid a gooey clump.

Outstanding. I fussed with Risotto forever... never again. Just use this recipe. It's faster, less temperamental. It can be expensive and hard to find basil in the midwest, so I substitute fresh spinach. I also add cooked, finely chopped chicken to make a great lunch to serve with a salad. An inexpensive way to make an easy dish out of stuff you should have on hand! My favorite kind of recipe.

Yum. I sauteed a clove of garlic in the melted butter before adding the orzo and used a bit less cheese. This was a bit too sophisticated for my younger ones but the older kids and hubby loved it.

Easy and Tasty. Everything I could want in a side dish. Used dried basil and it was fine. The cheese will     make the difference in this dish.

Probably my favorite recipe I've ever made from this site.  I always saute a couple of shallots in the butter before adding the orzo, as well as a decent sprinkling of crushed red pepper.  I add shredded roast chicken right before serving.  Really awesome.  Much easier than laborious risotto dishes that I've made, and just as tasty.

It was good, not great.  I didn't have fresh basil so I left it out (suggestion of recipe submitter).  I'll try it again with fresh basil to see how much of a difference that makes.

Love this recipe! I add about 2 cups of sauteed mushrooms, a small sauteed onion and a little more basil. If you use reduced fat butter or olive oil to brown the orzo, and reduced fat Parmesan it can be great for Weight Watchers. This dish goes excellent with oven roasted chicken.

I absolutely love this recipe!  My sister's boyfriend found it originally and now my whole family makes it.  Such a simple concept, but it's a wonderful side dish (or main!)  You can add in tons of different things as well, but I love following the recipe exactly - it's perfect!

Excellent, followed recipe exactly. It needed a little salt, but amount would change depending on the saltiness of the parmesan. Mixed leftovers with spinach and mushrooms, and made a great meal!

I was doing my best to use up the last of my basil and I don't think I could have found a better way! I forgot to take the reviewers advice and add garlic, but it was fantastic even without it! I did have to keep adding extra water when the orzo was cooking because it wasn't quite cooked enough. I also almost doubled the basil. I will certainly be making this again!

I didn't have fresh basil so I used the dried basil in my spice rack.  It was still very good but next time I will buy fresh.  Very easy to make and a yummy side dish.

Great recipe.  This was my first time cooking orzo and everyone really liked it.  I would recommend decreasing the cooking time or increasing the stock since mine turned out slightly dry. I will be making this part of our rotation.

What a nice change from rice or potatoes as a side dish!  Other than cutting the butter down to 1 tbsp. I made it as the recipe states, and it's delicious.  Definitely a make-again.

This was amazingly good! I didn't expect it to have a lot of flavor because it seemed so simple, but it did- I loved the parm/fresh basil combo. This will now be one of my go-to side dishes. Yum!

Delicious side dish. Made this for my family & they loved it. Actually my 2 kids & I ate before my husband came home from work & we cleaned the pot!. Now  I have to go make another batch before hubbie gets home. This is a great basic dish with endless possibilities for additions. Can't wait to try it with garlic. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! I did it as written and with mushrooms and it was great both ways. This would be a wonderful base recipe as well with so many possible additions. I think I will try it with fresh peas and garlic next!

I started this orzo with sauteing onions and garlic, I had some left over bacon from breakfast and threw that in here too, this was DELISH!! It was creamy and salty,the basil was subtle. I will of course make this again! Thank You Dodie!!

I love Orzo and this was a good recipe to showcase it. Except, it was too bland for me. I add a lot more spice to it. Some chili sauce and lots of chopped garlic.

This was a nice side dish - a good change from rice or other pastas.  We love it.  We had to use dried basil but can imagine that it would be fantastic with fresh basil. Very simple - my 15 year old son made it for us tonight.

Very good, although I personally thought it was a bit too heavy on the cheese.  I'll put less in next time, but bf LOVED it and finished off the rest of it (which I guess would've been a total of 3 servings for him).  I just realized typing this review that I forgot to put any salt and pepper in and we still liked it a lot, so I'll definitely make it again.  Great use for fresh basil!  Thanks for the recipe!

Dang good Orzo served with grilled butterfly lamb.  When I sauteed I had several different colors of brown in the orzo.  For chicken stock I use an Amish base so I can control the infulence. Basil was fresh from the garden, 1/3 cup.  Result: I wish I had tripled the recipe and so does the family.

I thought this was awesome.  I usually hate rice-a-roni side dishes, but I thought orzo by itself was fantastic.  I agree that you could cut down on the butter and it would still be great. Our basil plants were going berserk so we were looking for recipes that needed fresh basil.

Usually side dishes are no big deal, but this was AMAZING!!! So yummy. I only used about 1 tablespoon of parm (all I had). I also added some garlic powder and pepper. Salt was not needed due to the chicken broth. My husband does not like boxed rice but LOVED this. He thinks it would be good with vegetables like peas. Will make again and again.

Excellent.  Followed the directions and added one fresh, seeded, chopped plum tomato during the last 5 minutes.  I wish I doubled the recipe.

I just love this recipe.  I seem to be making it every weekend with enough leftover to nibble on during the week. BF cleans his plate every time I make it.

LOVED this recipe! Paired it as a side with the Quick Chicken and Wine I also found on this website and it was a great dinner - I did not use all the parmesean suggested in this dish so the orzo turned out gooey but not too cheesy. Simple and tasty.

This was great.  Basil is such a perfect flavor w/the parmesan.  Perfect with flank steak, pork tenderloin, etc.  Use as much basil as you want - I added a bit more.  And I added lots more cheese than it called for which made it extra flavorful.

Yum! I loved this recipe. Next time I will add the cheese and basil just before serving. It sat on the stove for a bit before we ate it and the texture changed.

Mmmm.  It was yummy and easy!  I added a few cloves of garlic, but followed the rest of the recipe.  It only took about 9 min to absorb all the liquid, so keep an eye on it.

Simple and delicious.  I had to use dried basil, as that was all I had on hand (used 2 tsp. which was the perfect amount).  I did have to add more liquid, as the orzo wasn't cooked through by the time the liquid had evaporated.

Prepared recipe as written. Had never made orzo before, and now prepare this dish at least twice a month. Great as leftovers also. Freshly grated parmesan and fresh basil really make this dish.

Easy to make and fairly tasty. Served with grilled shrimp, which it paired well with. Careful how long you cook the orzo, as mine was somewhat overdone at the end of the cooking time. Thanks!

Very tasty combination! We substituted a few things due to kitchen limitations and a vegetarian preference.  We used penne pasta noodles, mushroom broth and added some mozarella, red pepper flakes, italian seasoning, and fresh basil. I may try to add some broccoli and/or portabella mushrooms next time for a little something extra - but this was very tasty, indeed.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe very bland - even after adding extra parmesan and salt, we still thought it tasted really boring.  I ended up with a ton of leftovers which no one ate and we threw away the next night.

Simple, fresh, and delicious. Easy to whip up with a weekday meal. Fresh parmesan and basil are key. Scale back butter to about 1/2 tbs (feels sort of greasy with the oils from the cheese).

Enjoyed the flavor of the finished product. Found that all of the liquid absorbed very quickly & needed to add more.  Also, it became a big stuck together mess before everyone had a serving.

This recipe is wonderful and elegant.  Comes across as being much more difficult to make.  And the taste is superb. By far the best orzo recipe I've ever had. It is definitely delicious and presents well - I serve it to dinner guests and they rave about it.

Hubby says 3 for this one, I say 3.5, so I settled on 3!  It was definitely good, but we prefer the mushroom orzo from this site, it's definitely our favourite.  This made a really nice side to my Chicken, Mushrooms, Prosciutto and Cream Sauce from this site.  Yummy!

good flavor and easy recipe. I added some additonal chicken stock when adding the parmesean cheese and basil because the orzo was clumking.

Wow!  This is so easy and tastes so great!  We liked it both with and without the cheese.   I completely forgot about the basil.  Might try that next time, even though it was perfect without it.  The only thing I did differently was add onion powder and some garlic salt to the orzo while it was cooking in the broth.

This was fantastic and so delicious!  I am sending the recipe to all my friends because it was so easy and so tasty.  A nice and different side dish from what you normally see.  I think it would be a great dish for the summer with some fresh diced tomatoes along with the basil.  Can't say enough good things about it!

I thought this was a great side dish.  It did have a strong parmesan taste, so put in less if you don't like it so strong.  What we didn't eat the first night, I heated up and we ate the second night.  It was just as great!

This turned out more like mac & cheese for me, not what I expected.  I increased the serving size - perhaps that threw off the ingrediants.  Also used dried basil, not fresh.

Outstanding recipe! Plus, it prepares in about the same time it takes to cook the salmon on the grill.

I make a similar dish. I leave out the cheese and put in almonds when I sauté the orzo.  I also do not add all the broth at once I put in a little at a time. When the broth is absorbed I add more until the orzo is done.  My husband and 7yo son love it!

The possibilities are endless with this by mixing in different ingredients - peas, broccoli, spinach, chicken, etc.

Good, but not my favorite. I doubled the recipe, so maybe that was the problem. I was hoping for a more creamier pasta dish.

I played around with this one a bit. I did not have broth so I just added 1 1/2 cups of water + 1/2 cup of milk. I first sauteed garlic + red pepper flakes and then added the orzo in and sauteed. Added milk + water and some dried basil. At the end I added in some mozzarella and parm. Tasted very good!

An excellent side dish to roast chicken! I used the chicken drippings with the broth for an even richer flavor, and a bit of chopped, fried bacon. I went easy on the parmesan, I preferred it without.

So good and simple. Unbelievably flavorful for adding so little. Butter, Orzo, chicken stock powder, water, parmesan cheese, turkey sausage, and spinach. I didn't know a dish without extra salt or any other spices could taste great!

My whole family absolutely LOVES this recipe! The recipe is 5 stars as is, but we don't always have fresh basil on hand, so sometimes we have to omit it. For a one-dish meal we stir in 3 links of crumbled/cooked Italian sausage once the orzo is done cooking.  Also, I occasionally add a few shakes of Greek seasoning to change it up a little.  I have to drive 30 minutes to find orzo in my area, so I usually buy 10 boxes at a time!

this was really good and easy and it smelled great. i did sneak a bite before adding the parm and i actually liked it better before i added it. i felt the parm really took away from the velvety texture of the butter sauce.my advice is to try it before adding it and if you think it tastes great as is leave it. thanks for an easy recipe using inexpensive staple ingredients.

This ended up being great after I diluted the soup 3 times while cooking the pasta.  It's a BIG MISTAKE to use concentrated broth in this recipe - it makes it TOO salty - especially with parmesan cheese.  I skipped the basil and reduced the butter by half.  I didn't find it too dry - because I added water while it was cooking to ensure the pasta was cooked. The finished result was *****.

This recipe was really easy to make and to add a little extra flavor I added some minced garlic to the rice while it was browning. Even though I used a low sodium chicken broth, the Parmesan cheese has a good amount of salt so I only added some fresh cracked pepper to season. Surprisingly it turned out much better than I expected!

We really loved it.  Saute a few cloves of garlic, then make sure you thoroughly saute the orzo in butter and or olive oil.  It will turn brown when it is toasted.  I am sure that I added more chicken stock than it calls for, because I added some then added a little more as needed.  I used fresh basil and it was quite tasty.  Like something you will find in an upscale restaurant.

I love to cook, read my other reviews, I'm pretty easy to please, but my mouth did not agree with this one.  It was oily and I didn't like the texture after I added the cheese, it seemed like it either needed a lot more, or I shouldn't have added it to begin with.  And definitely not worth the $1.99 for the fresh bunch of basil!

This was great. Made essentially by the recipe but my husband threw in a large slosh of heavy whipping cream at the end of the preparation. And then let it sit for an additional five minutes. We loved it.

We put parmesan on everything but I found this a little intense. Will make often, but will definately reduce the cheese to taste.  I also added 1tsp minced garlic while browning the rice, and some extra broth towards the end as per other reviewers. Otherwise this recipe was a great side dish.  Very scalable, from cooking for two or for an entire family.  Similar to risotto without all of the work.

This recipe is very versatile. I usually make it with the parmesan cheese, but I was out yesterday and used some cheddar. I also roast some vegetables (onions, asparagus, corn, tomatoes, zucchini, peppers...) with olive oil and then toss it all together. It is a good way to use up any leftover veggies. It is very hard to screw this one up!

Very good side dish. I added garlic and onion and a little heavy cream. This is very versatile... lots you can do with it. Hubby really liked it, too. I served it with Lemon Pepper Chicken and some grilled pineapple. Om nom nom! Thanks!

To quote my 8 year-old daughter, "wow, this is good!" I also made a few adjustments, based on other reviews. I added mushrooms sauteed in garlic at the end (next time I might be tempted to sautee them in a little white wine). I also added some cooked brown rice and a little extra parmesan. Excellent base recipe.

I served this with Baked Salmon Fillets Dijon (recipe from this site) This was the perfect side dish. I think you could serve this with just about anything. Wonderful! The only thing different I did was add 1/4 cup chopped onion. I sauted it in the butter about 3 minutes before adding the Orzo. Great dish! Thanks for sharing.

A nice creamy orzo recipe and quite tasty.  (Almost reminded me of risotto.) Easy to prepare: it simmered while I grilled outside.  Our kids liked it, too, once they got past the name "orzo" which was something they were sure they wouldn't like it.  Adding this to our regular rotation.

This is a surprisingly delicious side dish.  I say surprising because after reading the recipe i thought it might be bland.  I had additional spices and cheeses ready to add however after taste testing the orzo it was perfect as written.  I think fresh grated parmesan is the key to this quick, easy and tasty dish.

This is a great side dish with so many different things. My whole family loves it-even my 3 & 5 year olds. I do add a bit of heavy cream or half & half at the end to make it creamy. Also, I usually need to add a bit more chicken broth. Fresh basil is a must and sauteed mushrooms are great in it too!

Great recipe as written and great recipe to tweak.  I added sauteed spinach (a 5 oz. bag) and about 3 large mushrooms that I slivered up and sauteed with the spinach. I did use more chicken broth than called for because the orzo really soaked it up.  I added an extra can (2 cups).  It came out great and I will be making again.

Big Hit. Husband loved it. Cooked as is, had fresh basil in the freezer. I simmered it for 15 minutes, any longer it would get mushy.

I was looking for something besides rice for a starch with dinner and this was great - even the kids loved it! I've made it twice and the only issue I've had was that the orzo browns very quickly so I had to keep a close eye on it and add the broth as soon as it was browned enough. Also, I used olive oil to brown instead of butter and maybe that was why it browned too quickly. Good reliable recipe!

This is the best side dish. Kinda like making RiceARoni but better. melt the butter, then brown the orzo. I dont keep chicken broth on hand so I just put a little less than one cup of water in my liquid measuring cup and boil in microwave then add chicken broth granules (1 tsp.)then stir good,add to browned orzo and simmer 15 min(you dont have to wait for water to boil cuz it boil in microwave in about 2 min). I love the parmesan and basil in it(I like the sargentos artisian blend it has another kind of cheese in it too!!). This is my new once a week side dish. potatoes, mac n cheese, and regular rice were getting old. This is a great recipe. Its a long time keeper for me and my family.Thanks for sharing

This recipe is simple, easy, and DELICIOUS.  You don't need to change and thing and it's perfect, especially if you're a parmesan and basil lover like I am.

In reference to an earlier review, I must say it would be crazy to leave out the basil.  The fresh basil MAKES this recipe.

I love orzo, husband doesn't. I liked the flavor of the basil in this & I'm not a basil fan. I couldn't find any good looking fresh basil so I used this squeeze bottled basil puree I found at my store. It was good. Next time I won't use the basil & see what happens.

WOW was this good!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I followed Shawn's advice and added 2 tsp dried basil into the chicken broth.  It turned out great, but I will try fresh next time.  Using fresh grated Parmesan cheese is key.  The leftovers didn't even make it through the night!

My mother loved this when I cooked it for her.  I will always toast my orzo and then boil it in broth or stock from now on.  I added in some pinenuts and it was fabulous.

This is a great simple recipe! The flavors blend together perfectly for a wonderfully tasty dish! I served it with BBQed chicken, which was a bit overpowering because of the marinade, but the orzo still shone. Next time I'd serve it with baked chicken or something more subtle. Great recipe!

This was good. The changes I made were to use vegetable broth & dried basil. I felt it was a little lacking in flavor but it is still good. Thanks. Edit: It needed garlic. I find myself using this time & time again. I recommend.

This recipe is a keeper! It's much better than the packaged brands I usually buy. I will make this again and again. I didn't know homemade could be so easy! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and I forgot to add the salt and pepper, but it still tasted great! Thank you!

Very good- quick, easy and a nice alternative side dish.  My picky husband had 3 servings.  I added sauteed mushrooms, pinenuts and spinach to mine- he had it as is.  I also added 1/2 parm cheese and 1/2 romano cheese.  good stuff!

This was delicious! Very easy to make on a busy weeknight. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of basil. I used about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil. Definitely use fresh parmesan cheese for this one. It was actually "stringy" from the cheese when I dished it out!

This was a big hit with the whole family.  We omited the fresh basil for a little less of the dried.  It was SOOOO good.  It is now one of our staples at the dinner table.

I made this dish as a side to some mushroom chicken the other night and everyone thought it was very good; but I thought it could have been better.  On the plus side, the dish is very quick and easy to put together using ingredients we commonly have on hand.  On the negative side, this dish must be served immediately after stirring in the cheese otherwise it gets very dry and clumpy.  I will likely make this dish again, because it was tasty and easy to prepare for a weeknight side dish, but I will add some toasted pine nuts for crunch.

I was making it one night, and my dad was watching me.  He sounded really confused when he asked if we were having it for dinner.  I told him we were and asked why he was asking me that.  Well, he thought that I was making Rice Krispie Squares.  The cheese is sort of stringy when you're taking it out of the pan, and it really does look like Rice Krispie Squares!  Updated on 6/29/09:  I'm still so impressed with the favorable comments on this recipe.  Glad everyone likes it so much.  I keep thinking that I want to try some of the improvised versions that others have come up with, especially those with mushrooms or tomatoes.

I made this dish two nights ago and currently have it on the stove for more. I made the dish for three girlfriends at a little party trying various nibbles. It was excellent and the perfect dish to prepare as guests are arrving. Simple to make and easy to walk away for a few minutes. The timer went off and it was perfect. This time I am using just a little less butter. It seemed a tad bit buttery for my taste, but that could have been from the cheese - which gave it great flavor! I am just taking a bite of the second batch. Still great. I think this could easily have a bit of meat, like chicken, turkey, or pork added to make a one dish meal...whch would appeal to my husband more.

Perfect. I had to use dried basil and didn't use as much as listed, but this was delicious. Was worried that it would turn out to be more of a risotto, but once you add the cheese and basil, it is definitely a delicious pasta  side dish. The hubby really enjoyed it too.

This is our favorite Orzo recipe. It goes well with meat, fish, chicken.  When I have orzo in the house, it's the only orzo dish my husband asks me to make.

This is a wonderfully easy and yummy. Very easy and fit for a dinner party.  I used fresh parma and had a little trouble getting it to blend properly but the taste was perfect.  I used fresh basil.  I think next time I will add some mushrooms to the mix.

Yum yum yum. Delicious. I used parnagiano-reggiano cheese and dried basil (what I had on hand). I could have eaten the whole pot. Husband and my 10-month old loved it too!

Love this. The first time i made this I messed up and put cilantro be accident, but is was STILL delicous! This is now a staple thing do as a side, fast and simple. I do 1 can of broth and 1 can of water because it cooks down so fast (I think because I have a gas stove). Thanks for submiting :)

What a lovely side dish.  I could handle this as a meal on its own with fresh sliced tomatoes on the side.
Followed the directions exactly.  Made it a few times and family loves it.  Thanks.

This is one of those dishes where you can really add what you like or have on hand.  It's a great base to start with...my family loves orzo.  Will make this in several variations again and again.

Excellent!  Served this as a side to rosemary-crusted beef tenderloin, and it was gobbled up.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and used prepared squeezeable basil instead of fresh.  My only criticism is that the serving size was too small! :)

I made this last night for the first time and realized after getting started that I was out of fresh basil.  NO WORRIES!  The dried worked just fine.  Gave it a great flavor, I will definitely make this again.  It was so easy.

This was pretty good.  I did not have basil so I used rosemary which I thought worked out well.  It was a little drier than I was expecting but it was still tasty.

YUMMY!  I've only made this once (so far) but I can't wait to make it again!  It was EASY, pretty quick (timed well with the chicken I was making), and VERY yummy.  I left off the last 2 tablespoons of basil garnish, and it was perfect already.  I think adding more might have been a little overkill.  I might lessen the amount of cheese by just a smidge next time, but it was still fantastic as-is.

This was a great alternative to the usual rice/pasta side dish.  I loved the richness of the cheese, and the freshness of the basil.  Although it did become quite thick as it sat, I think next time a little hot chicken broth added at the end, may help keep it moist.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was great--followed the recipe exactly except used fresh shredded parmesan, not grated.  Excellent, easy and got rave reviews from our guests---everyone asked for the recipe.  Served with oregano, lemon and garlic chicken and a greek salad.  I think the keys to making this outstanding are fresh basil and fresh shredded parmesan.  I will make over and over again!!!

I have made this several times and it's my husband's favorite side dish.  It went well with the grilled lamb chops we had last night.  Thanks Dodie.

Made this for a freezer meal swap....in seal a meal bags, it kept well.  Everybody raved about it.  Also brought it over to a family meal....my sister-in-law asked if I minded if she took the one serving that was left...it was that good!

I absolutely love pasta but I didn't think this would turn out as good as it did. I couldn't find any orzo pasta so I got small spiral ones instead, and it turned out great! Totally loved it. Doesn't even need salt and pepper. Simple and delicious :)

This is my new side dish when we are so tired of the usuals.  I cut back on the basil a bit and served the Parmesan on the side, at the table.  Very nice dish and I am thinking of some add ins for the next time.  I will be making this again.

Have been looking for new ways to use the basil in my garden.  I had a vegetarian friend over for dinner so I used water instead of chicken broth and probably did not use 1/4 c basil.  It turned out really great.  I can't wait to make it with chicken broth!

A bit disappointing. I love orzo, but this had too much salt (from the chicken broth) and WAY too much basil. It tasted like one of those prepackaged bag meals from the store.

I was definetly really good, however I wouldn't put as much basil if the basil is really strong. If you LOVE basil, then don't chnage a thing.

I have made this recipe 4 times this month so far--excellent!  I did make a couple of minor changes though--I only use 3/4 cup orzo, and that cuts down on the dryness that others mentioned.  I also omitted the basil and instead added a 1/2 cup thawed frozen peas and 3 T. real bacon pieces (or cooked, crumbled bacon if you like).  DELISH!  This is our new go to side dish.

Great!  A good & different side dish.  I used beef broth becuase I was serving it with meatloaf and I added some chopped garlic and dried onion while I sauteed the orzo. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry. I saved about 2 tbsp of the broth and added it to the orzo just before serving so it wouldn't be dry as others had mentioned.  I will definitley be making this again.

Yummm! I really liked this - dh said he would have liked it more without the cheese but that did not stop him from two helpings. I think it would be good with parmasan and peas or parmasan, fresh diced tomatoes, and basil or (you get the idea - anything)....thanks for a needed side dish update.

Fabulous!  This was very flavorful.  I used dried basil because I didn't want to pay $3 for fresh.  (I'm sure it would have been even better.)  I added fresh chopped mushrooms also.  Yum-Yum.

Very nice.  I added 1/4 cup of chopped fresh tomatoes and used margarine.  We liked it... and I'll probably make it again.  Next time, I'll add a little textured vegetable protein (TVP) and mushrooms to make it a more hearty meal.

Perfectly delicious!  This one was devoured quickly.  A better more elegant version of mac-and-cheese.  I used a vegetarian chicken style broth.  Will make again and again I'm sure. Glad I have that basil growing in my backyard!

If I didn't know it was pasta I would think it was Uncle Ben's Chicken Flavored Rice, only with a more fresh flavor.  Very good, I didn't change a thing accept I wish I would have had the fresh parmesan. Good side dish.

This was very good, it had a nice light taste and the fresh basil made it really good. I used a butter subsitute and it was still good.

So easy and so good.  I LOVE basil.  I used fat free chicken broth and this still  had a lot of flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this one several times now and there are never leftovers. I put onion and chopped fresh mushrooms in to saute with the orzo. We use freshly grated parmesean and just a little basil. It's a family favorite.

Good, but too cheesy.  Maybe it could use more real cheese, and less parmesan.

Excellent recipe - five stars are not enough!  I made a couple of minor alterations.  I omitted the butter and used a pan coated with butter flavored cooking spray instead.  I also substituted 1-3/4 cup of water and 2 chicken cubes for the can of broth.  I will definately make this again, and again.

This was pretty good. Next time I will cut the basil in half - at least.  Also, very sticky, I used shredded parmasan perhaps a finer grind would have worked better.  Husband politely ate it, but the kids wouldn't touch it - the basil was really strong.

It was okay.  I didn't add the basil because it seemed like it would be overwhelming.  It tasted kind of bland with just the cheese and the mushrooms I sauteed then added.  It's a good basic recipe though that I will use to experiment with other flavors.

This tasted OK but I thought it turned out too "sticky". If I made it again, I would cut the butter in half and decrease the parmesan cheese some. I did add a little extra chicken broth at the end to try to make it less sticky but it didn't work very well!

This is very good and easy to prepare.  Without the basil and with a dash of garlic powder, it is a very good substitute for boxed macaroni and cheese...similar in flavor, although much better, of course.  Does need more liquid added while cooking.

delicious! i think i'll cut down on the basil next time - it had a tiny "bite" to it.  also, it took about 15 mins longer for my liquid to absorb.  i served chicken marsala on top of it - fantastic!  and even better the next day!

pretty good, but the parmesan doesnt mix/melt well, so possibly another cheese should be substituted.
