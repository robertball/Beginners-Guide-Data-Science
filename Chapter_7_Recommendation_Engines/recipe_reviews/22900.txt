This is a great recipe.  Regarding the low review: because there is no oil or butter in the recipe, the moisture content of the dates is very important in how "luscious" this cake is.  I get a tub of dates at Costco and I dig out the stickiest, most moist dates in the tub and use for this recipe.  This is especially important for the drier 'Deglet Noor' variety of dates.  If you can get your hands on *very fresh* 'Medjool' dates, the recipe is phenomenal.  In summary, don't use dried up dates because most of the moisture in this cakes derived from the dates and if the dates aren't moist then the cake will be dry.  If this were truly a bad recipe, it wouldn't be rated so high.  This is a case where the quality of ingredients counts.  

I have made this a few times and I am comfortable changing it up a little depending on what I have on hand.  It's great as-is, but I like it with a handful of Guittard milk chocolate chips and/or a handful of Baker's coconut, too!  People who have never eaten dates before rave when they try this cake!

I lowered the batter down for 6 people, because I had only one egg, but when I made the dough, it was to little for the pan. I doubled everything (exept for the egg) and made cookies instead. They were delisious! Since there are 5 people in my family, I give it 10 thumbs up!

I hate to give negative reviews but I found this cake to be dry and tasteless. I was sorely disappointed because the word "luscious" in and of itself calls to mind other words such as moist, creamy, rich, etc. This was none of those. I was able to salvage the recipe by frosting them with a browned butter icing, but as-is they are dry little bars.

Excellent recipe! Make sure to cut the bars while warm it's so much easier.

Tried and everyone loved it at home. Substituted raisins, cashews instead of pecan and added less sugar.

This recipe was easy and came out terrific.  The only problem I had was whether to add whipped cream or ice cream to it; the whipping cream won!

I served this topped with some Greek  yogurt - the 'tang' of the yogurt offset the 'too sweet' of the cake. Thanks for the great recipe!

A good recipe if you don't want any added fat.  It's quite sweet though.
