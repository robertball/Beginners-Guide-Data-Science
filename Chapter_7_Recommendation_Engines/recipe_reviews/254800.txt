This is a lot of work if you do not own a food processor but the outcome is worth it. The one thing I did not like about the recipe is the color the cauliflower turns as soon as you add the vinegar. I recommend using a white balsamic instead of the dark one that I used. This has a nice earthy taste to it and would go with many different things. Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly and we didn't even notice the cauliflower rice...everyone had seconds!  So delicious!
