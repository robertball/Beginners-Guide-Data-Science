I love this recipe. 1) I seasoned my wings with garlic powder, onion powder and a little seasoning salt. 2) I baked the wings at 400 degrees for 45 minutes on one side and then turned them over and cooked them for another 45 minutes on the other side, ( I like my wings baked crispy, not soggy). 3) Then I mixed together the honey, bbq sauce and a 1/4 cup of soy sauce in a bowl and coat the wings one by one using a spoon to mix the wings in the sauce. I returned the wings to the pan and cook an additional 20 minutes. Excellent texture and taste for me. It sounds like a lot of work but it is not. I usually make about 20 wings. Thanks for the recipe. Oh and F.Y.I when you bake chicken coat the pan with olive oil, I use 3-4 tbsp of olive oil, so that the chicken does not stick the my pan.

Absolutely delicious. My son who doesn't like anything bbq'd devoured them. I used 22 frozen bagged wings and had enough sauce for at least double that. I ended up not using all the sauce. I transfered them to a cookie sheet to get browned and sticky towards the end. I also basted them frequently through out cooking. I baked them plain for 20 mins first, drained off accumulated juices then poured on sauce.

Excellent recipe, I just tried and my family loved it.  It will become part of our normal meal rotation.  I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the wings with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder and baked for 45 minutes at 400 on each side.  Then I added the glaze, which I reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and baked for about 15-20 minutes more and the wings were delicious and falling off the bone. Very crispy and a good texture, flavor was just right.

These are fantastic!  I buy fresh drummettes. I find they don't have a lot of fat or an excess of skin on them.  I season them lightly with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Next, I pop them in the oven for 10 min on each side just to crisp them up a bit. I taste test my sauce then pour over the drummies on a foil lined pan.  I find they need to bake at least an hour after that. We like the sauce to be thick and gooey.  Delish!

I didn't change a thing for the recipe. I do recommend lining the pan with foil though, as it helps make clean up easier (also, clean the pan while it is still warm). My husband's response to these was to inform me that he felt it was his duty to make sure none of them were left "lying around".

These wings are unbelievably good and so easy to make.  I did't even bother to measure the ingredients--I just eyeballed it and they came out amazingly tasty. I also cooked them at 375 (to speed up the cooking time a bit in time for the game) and they came out great.  Not quite barbecue, not all sweet, and not salty, but a perfect combination of all three.  I will also try this sauce on drumsticks--I beth that they will be super good.  This recipe will definitely become a regular in our house.

These were okay but they were way too salty. I will try them again with less soy sauce.

These were AWESOME.  I usually make something similar with teriyaki, Frank's Red Hot and honey but my little one didn't like them because they were too hot.  These were perfect.  Saw that another reviewer liked the sauce on broccoli so we did that, too!  What an awesome dinner.  While it was cooking my daughter said she couldn't quit walking around "sniffing" the air!   Thanks!!!

Wow these were excellent.  My husband went on and on about them.  They just fell off the bone and were so gooey.  I am adding them to my regular meal rotation.

These were soooo Good, Kids loved them too. I also added garlic & Onion powder to wings and cooked them a longer than recipe calls for, because we like them crispier. I am making them for a party this weekend.

I have to say this was delightful and easy to make. The sauce was very rich and glazed the wings wonderfully. I, as well as other users, used mini chicken wings. I did bake them for 20 mins. before basting them, so nice and just a lil' gooey. Oh I also substituted 1/2 the soy sauce for terriyaki sauce.. hence I was out, hehe, still perfectly tangy. I will Definately make again.

Some ppl have said that the chicken did not get crispy. I KNEW the chicken wouldn't get crispy if I stuck to cooking them the way the recipe says. What I did was bake the chicken FIRST on a lightly sprayed, foil-lined baking sheet for about 25-30 minutes at 450 degrees. Then I poured the sauce over the wings and baked for an additional 10 minutes. I added a dash of mustard, some salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder and Cayenne powder to the sauce to give the sauce/chicken more flavor. They were good this way.

Absolutely delicious! I marinated these for six hours and my fiance declared these the best ever - and proceeded to eat some of mine! I didn't add any other seasonings, and after trying them, glad I didn't - they tasted fine on their own.

Just had it right out of the oven, and it tastes fantastic. I followed the advice of other reviewers : seasoned the chicken with lemon-pepper and garlic powder (no additional salt needed!) and used low-sodium soy sauce. Kept everything else the same, and had enough sauce to coat 25 wings/drummets, with leftover sauce to dump over it. I pre-baked the chicken with just seasoning on it for 20 minutes at 400, dumped out the juices, and then dunked each piece into a large bowl with the sauce and returned it to the same foil lined casserole dish. (I coated the foil with olive oil, like another reviewer suggested). Leftover sauce went right on top. Baked another 25 minutes for crispy gooey-goodness. Thanks to everyone for all the great suggestions!!

I cut up boneless chicken into bite size pieces. Then I made the sauce as directed. Put it all in the crock pot on low. Served over white rice.

Simple and awesome. The only thing I did differently was to first steam the wings for 20 minutes to melt some of the fat off (every little bit helps, right?) and then baked for about 35-40 minutes.

We love this sauce! I remove skin, sprinkle chicken with onion & garlic powder then bake at 350 for 15 min per side.  I pour sauce over chicken & return to oven for 45 more min basting chicken every 15 min.  We serve with brown rice & veggies.  Yum!

My family (aside from me) does not care too much for spicy foods so I look for versions of recipes that are on the sweet or savory side and this was perfect! I doubled this recipe using 24 drumettes, but only 1/2 the soy sauce. I followed the cooking suggestions of NEEDGREATRECIPES. I started out only putting in 1/2 the amount of honey but, after tasting the mixture, added the other 1/2. There was a lot of sauce so next time I may only up it by 1/2 instead of doubling it. These were fabulous! I loved that the sauce only needed 3 ingredients! Thanks for a great recipe!

We love these types of recipes!  We take wings, legs, thighs...whatever we have on hand...put in deep pan and cover with water.  Bring to boil and boil for about 20-25 mins.  Drain and run cold water over.  Then warm chicken on preheated grill
then bast n turn as many times as needed to get the coating you want!  YUMM!

I do mine a little differently.  I marinate them in Texas Pete Hot sauce for several hours, then place them on a rack sprayed with PAM in a pan lined w/foil.  I then brush them w/melted butter, garlic salt and pepper and some onion powder.  Bake at 450 for 45-60 min., turning once.  

They fall off the bone and turn out very crispy since all fat has drained off due to being on a rack.  They're not the least bit hot or too spicy.  If you like them hot, then pour hot sauce over them after they're cooked.

I just made these and they were soooo good!  Only thing I changed was to decrease the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I had enough wings for two batches so on the 2nd batch I tried the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked the wings (seasoned with seasoning salt and garlic power) for 20 minutes, turned and cooked another 20 minutes and then dipped the wings in a shallow bowl of sauce, coating each one and putting back in the pan to cook another 20 minutes.  They suggested 45 min, 45 min and 20 min, but I felt that was too long and the meat would be too dry.  They turned out nice and crispy and chewy. Thanks for a great recipe! We will be making these a lot.

I cooked skinless, boneless chicken breasts on the grill (adding garlic and onion powders first), then glazed them with this sauce.  As I was low on low-sodium soy sauce, I added soy sauce which had Tabasco in it--about 3-4 T.  It wasn't enough of a kick.  DS ate it so that's a plus.  If I make this again, I would decrease the BBQ sauce to 1/4 cup as the BBQ sauce taste was overpowering.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I seasoned my wings with seasoned salt and spices as well. Afterwards, I marinated the wings in the 'sauce' itself overnight.  I then shake off the sauce from the wings and then baked them at 375 degrees for 50 minutes, basting and flippping it every 20 minutes. (Put the sauce on the stove and bring it to a gentle boil for about 4-5 minutes)  Then toward the very end, I crisped it up at 400 degrees for another 10 to carmelized it.  Made this for first/second graders -- they couldn't get enough. **It is important to reduce the soysauce to about just 1/4 c. or less depending on taste when you already pre-seasoned it with salt**

I believe this would be excellent if baked as directed. I was concerned they might dry out so I altered the recipe by covering baking dish with foil for the first half hour. MISTAKE ..all my nice gooey sauce became a "soup" in the bottom of the dish and my chicken was naked!

The flavor was REALLY strong... a little too much for me.    I made and used the entire amount of sauce.  As some others have suggested, I cooked the wings at 400 degrees for 10 mins on each side.  Then I poured most of the sauce over the wings, leaving some for basting.  I cooked the wings at 350 for about 45 mins on each side (which others also suggested).    The wings were almost falling off the bone BUT the flavor was too intense.  I will use less of the mixture and possibly add it way later next time.

Excellent!  I used tenderloins thawed from frozen.  I meant to drain the tenderloins and add more sauce half-way through but forgot.  A light taste of the sauce permeatted the meat perfectly and the sauce was great with the oven-baked rice.  Will definitely make this again-and hopefully try the wings, too.

It was pretty good.  I cooked the chicken for 20 min before adding the glaze, as suggested by others.

I would say that there is too much soy sauce in the glaze.  If I make this again, I will cut the amount of soy sauce in half.

Excellent... I followed recipe exactly for ingredients.  I baked at 350 covered for 45, and then 45 uncovered.   They were fall off the bone delicious!

My 9yr old son who begs for xaxby's teryaki wings all the time worshipped these lol. I didn't measure, just eyeballed everything. They were easy and delicious! Glazed them repeatedly and they were excellent and sticky =). UPDATE. Everytime I make this I get raves. I never measure just eyeball, but my son prefers them when I use the JackDaniels brownsugar bbq sauce. I bake them at 400 for 45 min or so on one side, then 40 min or so on other side (i periodically peek in on them). Once the chicken is done and skin starts to thin and tighten I start glazing every 10 min or so. I finish it up on broil, stopping to glaze as often as possible. (I stand there and watch it these last 15 min). They are BANGIN!!! =)

I made wings for dinner tonight. This was one of the recipes I chose. I seasoned the wings with garlic granules and coarse ground pepper. I baked until done(I cooked @ higher temperature than listed). In a ziplock bag, I combined cooked wings and sauce. I let sit for a few minutes. On a foil covered pan, I placed wings back in oven till sauce was bubbly. Very good! Will certainly make again.

Made it last night and the whole family loved it!  I lined the pan with foil, which made cleaning a breeze.  The sauce was watery, so I reduced it on the stove and then put it on the chicken before serving.  The sauce might have been runny because I defrosted the chicken in the sauce. My idea was to marinate it before cooking. I served it with rice and the kids loved the sauce on the rice.  This was an easy recipe to prepare.

I used this same glaze on boneless pork loin chops.  I marinated the chops for about an hour in the glaze after I heated the glaze on the stove top.  The pork chops were a huge hit and did not make it for leftovers.

Too much!  The flavor was so overwhelming.  I hate to say that because I love food with LOTS of flavor.  I would use more chicken or chicken breasts if I made this again to even out the ratio of chicken to sauce.

I love this recipe!!  I did change it some.  I seasoned it then broiled it when it was cooked I took them off the broiler pan (used that so the fat wouldn't just sit with the food)  dumped them into the sauce then put them back in the oven for 15 min.  did this 4 times then I dumped them in the sauces again and broiled them till they were sticky and glazed.  I have 3 kids and a husband who are picky eaters and they loved this so much that they polished off the whole platter and beg me to make this all the time.  In the last month we have had it 5 times.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and cooked the wings at 400 for 45 minutes on each side before covering them with the sauce for an additional 15-20 minutes. It was definitely worth the wait! Everyone in my family loved the sauce. I've also used it on chicken legs with the same great results!

I won't be making this again b/c it isn't as versatile as I thought. We used chicken breast, but it didn't the glazed top we were looking for. Maybe if I'd cook it as long as it stated it would have, but the chicken would be so dried out you couldn't eat it.  If I try again, I won't use but a dash of the soy sauce because it made the chicken very salty for us.

Delicious!  I used 3.5 lbs chicken legs because that is all I had on hand.  The sauce was still enough to cover the legs. I also seasoned them with garlic & onion powders and a dash of salt.  Had to flip them every so often and bake for about 1 hr 15 minutes for them to get sticky. Also turned up the heat to 400 degrees the last 20 minutes.  Excellent recipe, will definitely be a regular in our house.  Thanks for sharing!

Served this to friends for cocktails and everyone loved them.  I seasoned them with garlic/garlic(Tastefully Simple) and seasoned salt, baked at 400 degrees one side and turned them for 20 minutes and added the barbecue sauce mixture last 20 minutes.  Awesome!

These were good. Doubled the recipe and made them exactly as the receipe stated. They had a nice flavor and I was worried because all I could smell was soy sauce!!! But, it wasn't over kill... the only thing I would change next time is use a little less of the sauce. It seemed to be too much.

I used this glaze for bone in chicken breasts and it was absolutely delicious. I seasoned the breasts with garlic and onion powders and salt and pepper. I roasted the chicken pieces with the seasoning only just until the skin got crispy. I then poured on the glaze and let it finish cooking. Once done I ran the chicken pieces under the broiler which caramelized the skin beautifully. Everyone loved this one Joan and thank you!

I cut and seasoned my wings with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and cracked pepper. Baked each side at 400º for 30 mins each. Half cup of bbq sauce and half cup honey. I only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce. I heated this mixture up in the pan for a minute or two to thinken. Coated my wings and threw them back in the oven for an additional 20 mins and I achieved a perfect glaze. I also threw in a dash of Frank's for a little heat. Remember to use tin foil to line your dish, and a bit of PAM. These were great, thanks.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site.  My boyfriend, the ultimate critic, gave it two thumbs up.  The combination of flavours is delicious and unexpected.  Thanks for sharing!

I always season my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and rosemary, and this time was no exception...but make no mistake, the star was really the sauce!

I've made these a zillion times now (okay, maybe about 10 times), so it's about time I officialy reviewed the recipe.  This is one of the easiest and best wing recipes ever.  I follow the original directions except when there's time I let the wings marinade in the sauce for a while, anywhere from 1 hour to 24. There are never ever any leftovers no matter how may I make.  Good stuff!

Perfect the way it is. I have used this receipe 4 times since the beginning of Xmas season.  I pre-cooked the chicken, added the sauce and then cooked again on a lined cookie sheet sprayed with PAM reserving any leftover sauce.  I stored overnight and when I re-heated the next day (in a lined, sprayed baking dish), I drizzled the chicken with some of the left-over sauce.  Once warm, I stuck under the broiler just for 1-2 minutes to give it a little more zing.  Because you can do ahead, these are perfect for pot-lucks.  By the way, it was my most requested recipe yet and was the first dish to go at each party.  I used a local bbq sauce called Larupin because I didn't want a product with high fructose corn syrup or MSG, and I used low-sodium Tamari to cut down on salt.  Remember if you add Accent, Season Salt or Lipton's soup mix to any recipe you are basically adding MSG and extra salt.

Awesome. I doubled the recipe so that there would be leftovers but there aren't any. I first cooked the wings at 400 degrees to cook off the excess liquid as a few reviewers suggested, for about 45 minutes then I mixed 1 cup barbeque sauce, 1 cup honey and 3/4 cup low sodium soy sauce together in a large bowl and then dunked a few wings at a time ensuring that they were all covered well. I baked them again maybe 20-25 minutes more than  broiled them maybe 10 more minutes. So good. Just be sure to line your pan with foil because it is extremely messy.

I used about 1/8 tsp. of red chili pepper flakes to add a little kick. Didn’t not cut into 3 sections. Served with package of broccoli and carrots with garlic sauce and buns.

Nice glaze.  I baked my wings for 45 minutes unglazed with a generous sprinkle of garlic powder and garlic salt.  Mixed up the sauce using 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup (per recipe) of BBQ and nearly a 1/2 cup of honey.  Spooned over the wings and baked about 15 minutes.  Turned and put on more sauce, baking for about 10 min.  They were soooo tender and fell apart.  One tip: Make sure you use aluminum foil on the pan.  If I hadn't I think the clean up would have been a LOT of work due to the sauce.  Also, I liberally greased the pan, and believe that helped the wings from sticking too much (although they did stick some).  Will make again for sure.

Great wings!  I didn't think I would like it after I put the 3 main ingredients together....however, I after I poured the sauce on the wings....I was kicking myself that I didn't make more.  The only thing I did differently was I fried the wings in a deep fryer and I seasoned them with onion and garlic powder and a little bit of salt.  Delicious!  I will be making these again!

way too much soy! Making them the second time around, I cooked for the wings naked for 30 minutes before adding the sauce. AlsoI halved,  the soy and added an extra 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and an extra 1/4 cup honey.
My 3 y/o love them and acts for more....and more...and more

These were quite good! I reduced the soy sauce just a tad as I feared they might come out too salty, but I don't think it made much of a difference. I also like this recipe b/c you can make it with ingredients readily available in your pantry.

Good. Need to cook for a little while before adding sauce. Or marinate for a little while before. Added some seasonings to wigs like garlic powder, oil then bake.

Best chicken wings recipe ever! It is my signature dish :) First I salt the wings a little (but only a little - the soy sauce is salty enough). Then I carefully roast them in the highest temperature at the beginning, then lower the temperature a little, turn the chicken wings couple of times during roasting, each time putting some more glaze on each side. They turn out finger licking good. Seriously! Great, simple yet effective recipe!

Great!  Used other's suggestions and cooked for 45 minutes, turned and added sauce, turning to coat.  Very tasty.  My husband was hesitant, but he liked them to.  Will make again - and loved not having to fry them!

OMG, I can't stop eating these. They were so good. I took the advice of other reviewers and lightly sprinkled onion powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt on them then baked for 35 minutes before adding the sauce and baking again. They were so moist and finger lickin' good! A definite keeper. Thanks Joan.

I love making wings. My default is usually frying them and then adding a sweet thai chilli sauce. This glazed chicken wing recipe trumps my other one. Definitely great. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe tasted great!!! I tasted it first after I followed most of it but adjusted according to other reviewers by adding half the amount of soy sauce. I also added the same proportion of texas pete's honey mustard to it as the BBQ and Honey and heated it over the stove a little. SO GOOOD!!! definitely keeping this one.

We love the  flavour of these wings!  I did use less soy sauce as I only had about 1/4 cup.  And found that it was just right for us.  They are so lovely and gooey. My only regret....didn't make more. Thank you for sharing.

Just took these little jewels out of the oven. Not only were they easy to prepare, they were GOOD !!! I have to admit that I did alter the recipe, but not by choice. I only had about a third of the half cup soy sauce needed. So I added Teriyaki sauce (oops, not enough). So I added some Tamari sauce to the soy and Teriyaki sauces to equal a half cup. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Definately 2 thumbs up.

Awesome and oh so yummy!  I did use 12 drumsticks instead of the wings b/c that's all I had.  I used the advice of others and added onion/garlic powder and salt, then baked at 350 for 45 minutes, then flipped them over for another 45 minutes.  I then added the sauce and cooked for an additional 10 min on each side.

These were fantastic.   I baked the wings by themselves for the first 40 minutes, then moved them to a clean pan to leave the grease behind, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly the first time.    The second time we added a few drops of Tabasco sauce and those were good too.

These are yummy and super easy. Be sure the wings are dry to the touch before you start, especially if using thawed frozen wings, or you could end up with watery sauce that doesn't stick.

Made it today for the 4th, everyone loved it!  Used wings and drums, wished it was more "glazed" but I did eyeball the ingredients, maybe I'll add something to thicken next time, very good flavor (used low sodium soy sauce)

Wonderful! I did follow the recommendation of other people to bake with just seasoned salt on them first (i only baked for about an hour- i was impatient). Then basted the sauce on and baked an additional 20 min. Delicious!

I had high hopes for this as a tasty alternative to Buffalo style wings, but the wings never got crispy (even though followed various reviewers suggestions) but stayed somewhat flabby and the taste was flat. We were very disappointed.

I found this had way too much sauce. Try cutting the sauce in half.

These chicken wings tasted good, but they were a little too messy/gooey for me, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating instead of 5.  I just don't like to get that dirty when I'm eating finger foods.  I will probably try making them again, but instead of cooking them in the sauce, I will bake the wings with seasoning, and then use the sauce as a "dipping" sauce.  I think they would be less messy, and just as tasty. :)

The taste was good but I had to make some adjustments. I did what one reviewer suggested and seasoned the wings with lemon pepper seasoning, popped them into the oven for 25 mins and then added the sauce to it, baked the whole pan for 1 hour. The problem was that there was way too much sauce and though the taste was good, it didn't caramelize as well as I'd hoped it would. Next time, I will do all of the above, except cut the portion of the sauce down to about 1/2 of what it currently calls for now.

My husband really liked these and wants me to put them on the regular dinner menu.  I thought they were pretty good, but I might try to cook down the sauce a bit to make it stick to the chicken more.

Talk about easy and delicious!!  I probably used a little less soy sauce and barbecue sauce and the soy sauce I have is low sodium but they came out perfect!  I didn't flip them or anything and I think I left them in about an hour -- still great! YUM!

Made these tonight for the 1st time and they were excellent!  I salted mine before pouring on the glaze with a little kosher salt.  Super easy to make and will definitely be making them again.  Very tasty glaze!

I made these wings last night and made a few changes, I put garlic and onion powder on the wings then coated them with the sauce, Placed them onto a cookie sheet, after 30 minutes in the oven I turned them over and brushed more sauce on them. When they were done I put them under the broiler, it carmelized the sauce and the skin got just a little crispy, I fit 32 pieces on the cookie sheet, Everyone loved them

Did the recipe as is. I think I should have baked the wings before adding the sauce, as others suggested. They turned out ok, very gooey, not crispy at all. Sauce was good.

I followed the other reviewers advice and seasoned the wings with garlic then baked them for 30 min on each side before basting them so they would come out crispy. If you're going to arrange the wings on foil, definitely grease the foil with oil or whatever u use or else they'll completely stick (I had to stop halfway thru baking to peel the wings off the foil, then I just got rid of the foil altogether)

I followed the glaze proportions exactly. It was on the sweeter side but my sister in law and I loved them. We'll probably be making this again over the weekend with bigger wings and will split them into two trays: this glaze and a spicy one for more variety.

This recipe was pretty good. My husband and I enjoyed but both agreed that the amount of soy sauce was a little too much. I will try the recipe again with less soy sauce and something spicy to give it a little kick.

This recipe might work better as a marinade.  While the skill was flavorful, the meat was unaffected by the sauce and relatively bland.  I think that maybe doing this overnight in the fridge would let the sauce flavor the meat as well as the skin.

Also, I had one guest comment that he thought there was too much Soy Sauce, though I personally thought it was fine (as did the other guests.)

The glaze tastes good, I won't complain about that. But the recipe seems pointless as it tasted no different than a bottle of honey barbecue sauce. No need to have a recipe taking up space in my book when I can just use the botttled sauce.

This is one of my go-to recipes now for wings. Every second time we have them actually and we have wings at least once a month.  Absolutely easy and great tasting.  Have lots of napkins available is all.

I used this recipe with only a couple of modifications.  I used drum sticks instead of wings and I cut the soy sauce in half and use a 1/4 cup of water.  I thought this was an okay recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I am always trying different chicken wing recipes as we are big WING people, and this is probably the best non-fried one I have come across.  I cooked them longer- I put them under the broiler for about 6 minutes to finish them nice and crispy.  They were great and I plan on making them again soon.

This is a really yummy sauce;however, I had to tweak the cooking process a little.  I baked it in the oven as advised; however, I ended up with tender little wings swimming in sauce.  So, I fished the wings out of the sauce and poured the sauce into a saucepan - boiled it until it reduced way down to a syrup.  In the meantime, I put the wings under the broiler for a few minutes until they had a little char on them - then I poured the reduced sauce over the wings and mixed it all up.  It turned out wonderful in the end - family ate them right up!

I didn't change a thing from the original recipe and it turned out well! It didn't have enough oomph though, so I'm going to try adding some pepper flakes and black pepper, as well as garlic powder and onion powder next time.

I ADDED 1/4 CUP FRANKS RED HOT SAUCE TO SPICE THEM UP. I LIKE THE SPICY SWEET COMBINATION. I ALSO LIKE NO BREADING THAT IS PREVALENT IN OTHER WING RECIPES.

i made these last night for me and my boyfriend, he loved them but i found them to be a bit salty, it was either the soy sauce or the blue cheese i used.  i seasoned my wings with pepper, season salt & garlic and then cooked each side for 40 minutes. then poured the sauce on them and cooked them for 20 minutes. served with fries.

loved the taste and a great alternative to deep-fried wings. i would give it a 5 but i modified the recipe by baking the chicken first 10mins a side with seasoning salt and garlic powder before applying the sauce as others suggested.

As others suggested, I cooked wings for 30 mins a side (frozen).  Also seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  then dipped hot wings in the sauce for a minute or so.  popped back in oven for 20-30 mins.  So yummy!  my kids loved them.  I think I will try them on drumsticks and thighs and maybe add redpepper flakes next time.  will be making these again and again.

Followed the recipe/directions with great results. A wee bit on the salty side but still tasty. Definitely use low sodium soy.Will make again.

Very good and simple.  In addition to the recipe directions, I sprinkled the chicken with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder and let them bake for a while.  I also added a couple of spoons of pepper sauce to the bbq sauce, honey and low sodium soy sauce and coated the chicken with the sauce and let them bake for another 15 mins.  Delicious and very tender chicken.

These are awesome!  My husband couldn't stop saying how great they are!  I keep making them too!  I made them for an Xmas party and they were a HIT!  I used the suggestion from another poster and put onion powder, garlic and seasoning salt on the wings.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I have never attempted to make my own chicken wings before but this recipe sounded so easy and rated well so thought I would give it a try. I took some suggestions from past reviewers and these wings turned out great!!! I found lining the pan worked out quite well and was a breeze to clean up after. I seasoned the wings with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder. It does make a lot of sauce but we do like our wings saucy. Baking in a 350 oven for the 50-60 minutes was perfect cause my overly sensitive smoke detector didn't go off. Messy to eat but definetly finger lickin good. Will do this one again instead of going out for chicken wings.

I cooked them 20 minutes at 400 degrees each side to get rid of the juices. Then added the sause. Cooked for another 20 minutes or so. Delicious. Very easy and tasty recipe, when you want something other than hot. Thanks so much!

I made this to glaze the chicken breast I was making and it turned out really well.  I added some hot sauce to the glaze recipe before applying it to the chicken to give it a kick (we love spicy foods).  I also applied half of the glaze to the chicken, baked for 30 minutes, got rid of the water in the pan, applied the rest of the glaze to the cooked chicken and broiled for about 15 minutes--perfect!!  The chicken was nice and bbq'ish and the glaze didn't harden so I was able to use the glaze as a gravy for the mashed potatoes that accompanied this meal.  will definitely make this again.

These wings were great! What I like best about this recipe is that u can make it just the way you like it by addind or taking away. The same with the baking time. You can make it more crispy..less crispy or just bake in the sauce for a more tender gooey taste. You can change the recipe so much and it will still come out great! It's also very easy 2 make.

Ok, the 3 stars is based on the sauce alone.  I used a different cooking technique which I will describe in a sec, but first, let me address the sauce.  It was good...which is why the three stars.  Luckily, I tasted it before I began my process so I was able to make it great!  I started out doubling the sauce because of the way I was going to be cooking it, so after I tasted it, I added about 1/2 cup more bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece Original) and about 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  I used legs instead of wings because I was making this for a main dish.  I put them in the crock of my crockpot and poured the sauce over all.  Stuck in the fridge overnight.  Put them on this morning and let them cook on low for about 7 1/2 hours.  Poured the sauce into a pan and started letting it reduce.  Took the chicken to the grill.  The sauce wasn't thickening up the way that I wanted it to, so I added about 1/2 more bbq sauce.  That worked well.  Dipped the legs in the sauce a few times while grilling, and they were awesome!  Next time I might cut down the soy a little and maybe add a little more brown sugar.  Hope this helps!

My whole family LOVED these! I didn't have enough honey, so I used half honey and half maple syrup. DELICIOUS! I basted and turned them frequently, and broiled for a few minutes at the end to make them crispy.

This was quite tasty. I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and just a touch more honey. I also cooked the wings in a way that made the sauce more gooey, which I prefer with this type of recipe. I cooked the wings covered on 375 for one hour, making sure to turn them over halfway through the cook time. Then I removed the covering and cooked the wings unconvered on 375 for 25 minutes. Then I flipped them over and cooked for another 15 minutes. The sauce was the perfect consistency with that cook time and really clung to the wings! It'll take a while to get my pan clean, but it was worth it.

Very tasty. I baked for 40 minutes then grilled for 10 to 15 minutes. I need that grill taste and they turned out great.

I've been using this website for years because I love to try new recipes.  I wanted to do a simple chicken wing dinner, but didn't want anything spicy.  I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I followed it exactly except I took in account some of the other reviews and used a little less soy sauce.  I had about 17 wings and used about 1/2 cup soy, 3/4 cup honey, and 3/4 cup original flavor bbq sauce.  I seasoned the wings with Old Bay Lemon & Herb, Garlic Powder, and Pepper and it turned out delicious.  The kids and hubby gobbled it up.  There was barely enough for seconds!  I highly recommend this recipe.  :)

These are ok.  My guests liked them enough however I did not.  They are very greasy and kinda on the slimy side.  I think they might need to be cooked for about 1/2 hour w/o the sauce to dry them out a little and then basted a bunch of times.  I do think the recipe has potential but I will not make them as stated again.  Thanks for the idea!

The "glaze" was more of a sauce, and a little too salty for my taste.

These were great. I did get my wings crispy before I added the sauce but that is just the way I like them. I added a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder.

they are wonderful, family loved them. I did reduce the soy sauce to half and added chicken breast bites (a couple of minutes later) for the pickier eaters.

You can microwave the wings 10 minutes on HI then finish on the grill. Top with the sauce the last 5 minutes. Awesome!

Added some Minced garlic.  Took them to a 4th of July part as an appetizer.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The herd of 8 yr old boys took 2-3 every time their running route took them by the food table.  Making them again for church picnic

AWESOME.  I read reviews and reduced honey and added honey mustard.  I also precooked my wings before dipping into the sauce.  I would've liked for the sauce to be thicker.

Always line a 9 X 13 with heavy duty foil.
Follow the 1st reviewer's suggestions.  Season the chicken (I used thighs) bake 40 min.s---turn over and cook another 40 min.s.      POur the sauce over the chicken sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Watch the sauce to make sure it doesn't burn ( takes about 30 min.s more.   Serve with rice

I actually marinated the wings overnight and my husband and I thought they were delicious and juicy!  My husband said he might add some cayenne pepper to his next time I make this, but I thought they had enough flavor on its own.

Yum!  I put onion powder, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes on the wings and baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes on each side first, and then I dipped and basted the wings with the sauce for the next 15 minutes.  Even though I tweeked it, I tasted the sauce before basting and it was great!  The sauce is the main attraction.  I used Kraft Honey Hickory Smoke for the BBQ sauce.

I made these for dinner tonight and the family loved them! I followed the recipe; baked for 60 min. total and turned them over halfway through. The meat was moist and tender and the flavor was perfect. There was quite a bit of (excess?) sauce in the baking dish, so I may decrease the sauces to 1/3 cup each next time.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful glaze. Made these BAT WINGS for Halloween and my hubby ate 21 of them!! I marinated for a few hours and then cooked at 375 for one hour and then cooked for 30 min or so uncovered. Trying the glaze on chicken breasts tonight!

I followed others' suggestions and prebaked the wings for 20 minutes on one side and another 20 minutes on the other at 400 degrees.  I seasoned the wings with salt & pepper and drained the pan juices off before adding the sauce/glaze.  I then baked the wings for an additional half hour.  The glaze would be nice over rice, especially if it was thickened slightly with flour or corn starch.  I think the glaze would make a nice marinade as well.  I'll try marinating the wings in the glaze overnight next time I make this recipe.

I give it four stars only because I think the honey flavor overpowers the bbq sauce flavor.  I followed the directions of the other users by baking the chicken with seasonings first on both sides for 45 mins each and the chicken came out nice and crispy. Then the last 20 mins I added the sauce. My boyfriend and his friend loved it. There were no left overs. And the next day my boyfriend was still raving about it!  This will become a regular dish in our household. Thanks!

These turned out really well - I thought the sauce reheated the next day was actually better because it was a bit thicker since the initial glaze was runny from the soy sauce (I also used low sodium).  I'd make this again!

Great flavor but stayed very runny. I'll use this recipe again but thicken the sauce on the stove top before pouring over the wings!

Great combination of ingredients.  I used the recommendation of one the reivews regarding baking wings allowing them to become crispy and the use of garlic powder.  Very useful in making this recipe a success.

This recipe was easy and sooo yummy!  I read the other reviews and baked at 400 (40 minutes each side) for a little crisp.  It was perfect with steam rice :)

Used this as a glaze to pour over broiled wings. Absolutely delicious with Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. A big hit with the family; all of them disappeared.

These wings are great!! Everybody loves them. I was out of Honey and substituted with butter flavored syrup(non-maple) I liked it better than the honey. It gave it somewhat of a buttery-nutty flavor. I also baked the wing for 30 min. prior to adding the sauce. To crisp the skin some.

The wings came out very good.  I marinated them as suggested by one review, baked them w/o the sauce for 30min, drained the juiced from the wings and added the combined sauce.  I baked them for another 40min making sure to flip them on the other side as well.  Yummy!

I halved the recipe for a 4.5lb package of whole chicken wings.  I par-baked for 30 minutes the wingers before glazing with the sauce (another 10-15 minutes on bake), then flipped on the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the skins.  VERY good.  I also used a low-sodium soy sauce.

My husband added a few more spices to jazz things up a little, but this basic sauce is so good! We fried our wings first and then tossed them in the sauce. Then put in a baking dish covered with foil on low in the oven until ready to serve. The extra baking time helped to seal in the flavors. Yum!

Made as recipe states using less soy than called for, and added some garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. I did bake the wings about 15 mins then turned them over for another 15 mins. I then drained off any juices and put the sauce on, and baked until they were nice and gooey. These were awesome! Will keep this recipe! Hubby loved this one!

Very easy and everyone seemed to like them. They got a little burned looking by the end of the cooking time, though. For the sake of the dishwasher, put some foile in the pan because the residue is very sticky.

I thought these were very tasty.  I had never made chicken wings before, but I thought they turned out really good!

I tried this recipe in the slow cooker instead of the oven.  Of course, it turned out more like a marinade than a glaze, but still pretty tasty!

We really enjoyed this recipe-and also use the method to cook other parts of chicken. Definitely cooking the wings/legs/thigh first before adding the sauce is best to cook off the fat to allow the sauce to stick to the chicken.

This was a very easy recipe which was delicious.  I made it for my niece's graduation party.  I used frozen chicken wings, thawed and cleaned them before seasoning them.  I cooked the wings first before using the the ingredients in the recipe as is, basting it.  It was very tasty.
