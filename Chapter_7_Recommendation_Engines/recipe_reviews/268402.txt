Realized I was out of baking soda as I was making them so used about 3 t total baking powder and they turned out fantastic. Neither too dense nor too cakey. A true muffin texture.

OMG these are so good! Toasting the oats makes all the difference here! These muffins are lightly sweet (which I very much enjoy!) with the perfect amount of spice and a really lovely toasted flavor! The only things I did differently were to toast the oats and walnuts together in skillet instead of the in the oven and I used whole wheat flour in place of all purpose. I got 16 muffins that were baked perfectly in 16 minutes. Thanks so much for the recipe--I will definitely make these again!
