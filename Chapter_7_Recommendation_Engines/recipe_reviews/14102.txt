These are just fun. My suggestions: add the egg just after you flip the bread to toast the second side - also lower the heat and increase the cooking time so your egg cooks more thoroughly and your toast doesn't burn. You can use fun cookie cutter shapes ... hearts for Valentine's Day, stars for the Fourth of July ... and don't discard the cutouts. Instead toast them in the pan and top with your favorite preserves. Photo available on my profile page.

When I saw this recipe I thought omg this is like the eggy in the basket from V for Vendetta and the recipe looked so simple I had to try it. I just finished eating this and man this was a good breakfast. I used whole wheat bread and I cut out a heart instead of a circle.Next time I makes this I need a bigger boat since the hole I cut was a little to small for my egg. I recomend turning down the heat right before you put you egg in so you don't burn your toast while the egg cooks. Next time I try this I am going to scramble my eggs in a bowl first since I don't like runny yolks as much as scrambled eggs.

This is one of my standard breakfast dishes! My husband asks for it on all the special occasions he gets breakfast in bed and I make it for his entire family when we go up to the cabin for deer season. Of course, I call it a Bulls-eye Egg, so it's more aptly titled. :) 

I love this recipe - I put the egg in while the first side is browning because we only like the yolk to be a little runny and can't stand runny whites. Then I add pepper, salt, basil and the smallest pinch of rosemary to the egg before I flip it. Yum!

we called them "name toast," because my goofy mom had letter shaped cookie cutters, and you could get the toasts in your initials (or your whole name if you were really hungry)! we make tons of shapes, since cooking in my family is time to hang out together and be silly. snakes, dragons, fire hydrants- it's all fun. my boyfriend grew up calling them stained glass windows (huh?). you can make the scrambled eggs pretty easily by whipping the egg in a bowl with milk, salt, pepper, spices (dill) or whatever you like, then pouring it in. alternately, we had them as "french name toast" where you mix a bowl of eggs with vanilla, milk or cream, cinnamon, etc, dip the frame pieces and the cut outs in the mixture, and griddle-fry them like french toast, with the center full of either the sweet french toast egg, plain fried egg, or scrambled with savory spice egg. my brother used to eat them with mayo on top- not as bad as you would think, but really, i can't recommend it.

The pan has to be hot or the egg will creep out from under the bread -- it will still taste fine, but the presentation just won't be the same.  I used to love this one as a kid.  We called it a One Eyed Egyptian, but I still don't know why.  It's a good, easy to make classic, a great item for a young cook's recipe collection.

We called them Gas House Eggs when I was growing up.  I still make them. Only thing different, is that I do TURN IT OVER - carefully - after I let the egg cook on the underside, in the hole, a bit. Also, if you don't want to flip it, you can put a lid on the pan while the egg is cooking.

I've been eating this since I was a kid (Egg in a Hole according to my Dad). I'd suggest cracking your egg into a small bowl first before pouring it onto the toast for a few reasons; easier aim, less likely to break the yoke, and if the whites are cloudy you have a chance to discard a less than fresh egg before it's too late. I like the suggestions of adding herbs other than straight salt and pepper. Gonna try that! And I've ALWAYS preferred it with a good whole grain bread, sourdough, or even left-over peasant loaf, etc. for the deeper flavor.

As others have said this is a great, fun, simple recipe. Goes great with a traditional breakfast with bacon or sausage on the side. Good for a little change of pace at the table.

At first I thought...egg & toast?   Nothing unusual about that.   But there is something so much better about grilling breading in a frying pan vs. toasting it in a toaster!   Be sure to use a good slice of bread from a hearty bakery loaf.   And put the egg in as soon as you flip the bread to the other side.   Then lower the heat as far as possible and COVER the pan immediately.   It will take 7-10 minutes to cook the egg whites through but still leave a nice soft yolk.   This was delicious and very fun!!

What I have done is make a grilled cheese sandwich by buttering 2 slices of bread on the outside, a slice of cheese on the inside, and after cooking one side and flipping I use a glass to cut out the middle and drop an egg in. Add whatever spices you want after dropping the egg in the basket for additional taste then cover to trap the heat in and lower the stove temperature from medium to low which allows the egg to cook from bottom and top.  This also allows the grilling bread to slowly cook and not be burned when you take it off the stove.

BIG hit with the kids!  I used whole grain bread, and flipped over the bread with egg to cook the yolk a bit.  I found that the egg stuck to the pan, so next time I will spray the pans with non-stick first.

Growing up, my Grandma made these for us all the time; we called them "Toasted Yolkies." A few tips: 1) butter or spray the griddle/pan. 2) Flip once, just for 30 sec to cook/toast the top. 3) this might sound weird, but it tastes REALLY REALLY good if you spread a very thin layer of grape jelly on the outside toast. 4) don't overbook the egg! It's supposed to be runny so you can soak up all the yolk with that bread! 5) try using Texas toast....works very well.

This is how I like my eggs, nice and runny.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I had to flip it to cook the white a little more.  Probably my fault - hole not big enough or skillet too hot.  This is now my favorite way to have my egg.  Thanks!

I use 2 pieces of bread and bake it on 350 for about 20 minutes or longer depending on if the egg is cooked.  We've called them birds eye. We sprinkle cooked bacon and cheese around the sides.  The grandkids love them

I made this today, and it made me smile. :)  I, too, used the middle piece to dip in the yolk.  It was really good with fresh cracked seasoning from my lemon-pepper mill and a little bit of sea salt.

I have always known these as "One-eyed Jacks."  It makes a  heartier meal if you add a slice of cheese and then a second slice of bread for a grilled egg and cheese sandwich.  Very delicious!

We grew up eating these!  Always one of our favorite treats!  Except we called them "Eggs in a Hole."      

A few tips...      

1. To cut the hole in the bread, use a small cup (with an opening smaller than the bread); place it top down on the bread and press down until you can remove the center piece.      

2. After you add the egg into the frying pan, sprinkle salt & pepper to taste, while still unset.      

3. Put a little butter on that little circle of bread left behind and fry it up beside your Egg in a Boat.      

4. Do not keep the fire up too high - Medium at the most.  Place a lid on the pan so that the heat is kept in and circulates - this helps to cook the top of the egg at the same as the bottom, so you don't have to try the tricky task of flipping.    

5. Enjoy!!!

Very good and very easy! This was my first time making these and I had to flip them about halfway through cooking because the whites that spilled onto the top of the bread wasn't cooking. I was worried that it may ruin my yolks, but it didn't at all! they came out absolutely perfect. As another reviewer suggested, be careful about burning your toast while cooking the egg....another reason to flip these about half way.

I have had this before, but I had never made it myself. This is really easy for someone who doesn't cook much. I added a piece of cheese to the top and another piece of buttered bread to make it like a grilled cheese.

The best thing about this recipe is all the different names people call it.  I've heard it referred to as Toad in a Hole.  The picture is off-putting as the egg looks undercooked and the "toast" looks like a dry piece of bread.  I tried it and ended up flipping it as I knew there was no way the egg would be done to my liking.   Soft yoke but firm white. This works and I enjoy the taste of the the grilled style toast.

Last minute breakfast for my kids this morning since the muffins I made tanked. This is always a hit in our house. ALWAYS. I use whole wheat bread and organic eggs and sprinkle a little salt and fresh ground pepper over the egg after I pour it in. We loved this.

Made this for breakfast this morning. I told my daughter I was making a suprise for her, I used a snowman cookie cutter to cut out the middle. She said that it was the best suprise ever! For that alone I give it five stars.

My mom made these for us when we were kids (middle 40's now) and I made them for my kids-we still have them on occassion.  We call them picture frames and we sprinkle a few bacon bits and some chives along with salt and pepper before we flip the bread/egg over to toast the other side...always a favorite-give them a try.

This is a classic. It is good, too simple to be 'great'...but one of the first foods my kids learned to make. We knew it as egg-windows or Holey-toast. The circles that are removed from the bread toast nicely in the pan with the egg/bread and are part of the ‘fun’ of this particular treat. You can, with little effort, customize the egg centers; I'm fond of soft yolks and plain eggs. My kids prefer a seasoned 'scrambled' center. You can add grated cheese on the top after you’ve flipped them. You can also…if bored and cooking for someone who demands you break the yolk…write with the yolk on the ‘toast circle.’ It cooks into a visible ‘picture or letter.’ It can encourage reluctant eaters not only to eat...but to try 'different' breads, such as wheat (or anything not tasteless-white-LOL)

My children love this concept.  We watched V for Vendetta and decided to try it (they served it in the movie).  Don't over cook your egg though because you need that yolk for moisture.  It's easy and simple, and beats having to pop toast for every person having over easy eggs.

Funny all the different names for this simple but great dish. My mom called them Gashouse eggs, which is what the actor Don Ameche called them when he made this dish in a movie from the 40's, called "Moon over Miami". The classics are always best!

Pan-grilled bread is so much better than toasted ... Adding an egg makes for a fun an easy breakfast! I buttered the bread as instructed, but also coated my non-stick skillet with a touch of coconut oil for the added health bennies. Perfect!

I was looking for something simple to make for my kids' tea party and came across this recipe. I had never heard of this before, but my kids love eggs, so I went for it. We all enjoyed it very much. I did not precook my bread, but broke the egg right into the hole immediately, seasoned it with a bit of salt and pepper, then flipped the whole thing halfway through. Didn't have any issues with under/over cooked eggs nor burnt toast. Will be making this a lot more often!

i grew up with these because my mom grew up with them - we called them "miami eggs" because my grammy saw the recipe in an old movie called "moon over miami" lol 

when i was little i used to want to watch the movie while eating them… if it came on TV we would watch it. 

i preferred mine with "broken" yolks…so over the years i really make them all that way unless someone tells me they want theirs with the normal yolk… LOVE this - it's actually one of my "go-to" comfort foods! 

once in a blue moon i will put a tiny bit of shredded cheddar on them - which is tasty, but i think that i prefer them plain… (and i am a cheese-a-holic!)

This was really fun to make, though it took a couple of tries to get it right. For starters, medium heat seems to be good enough. Putting the egg in right after you flip it, sprinkling a pinch of salt, and immediately lowering the heat to low and covering it for about 3 minutes or so really works well to get the egg nice and cooked without burning the underside of the toast. I recommend using a clear lid so that you can keep watch on the egg. Since the recipe is a bit plain, I squeezed half a slice of orange into the butter and finely chopped a small leaf of fresh basil too. It adds a bit of zing to the butter to make it a little less plain. A friend suggested drizzling some hollandaise sauce or a balsamic vinegar and red wine reduction over it too.

This recipe is pretty versatile. If you want to make it sweet, you can add some maple syrup with some cinnamon spice to make a mock french toast. Making a filling of cooked strawberries and bananas helps to make it more nutritious, and you can use it to sandwich two pieces of bread. Or you can switch the butter for olive oil add some savory seasonings and tada! You have a meal more suitable for dinner. Whole wheat bread works well too.

This was delicious! I'm not a very good cook, and my only trouble was getting the white part of the egg that spilled over on to the top of the bread to cook. I flipped them and it worked out just fine!

I've been wanting to try this for a long time.  For various reason, one being that I'm wheat intolerant, I always put it on the back burner (no pun intended.)  We have four backyard chickens, so I'm always looking for ways to use the numerous amounts of eggs we amass. 

I made this for hubby this morning and topped it off with heated chili from last night.  Because our range died last week, I made this on our Cuisinart Griddler.  I felt like the bread didn't get quite as toasted as I would like, hence the four stars.  I will make this again, but work on making the bread more toasted (like grilled cheese sandwiches).  I have to add that hubby was very happy with the meal, so I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could.  I think it would be fun next time around to play with some seasonings as well.

I saw this cooked in the movie Moonstruck back in the eighties. I tried it for the first time yesterday and loved it. I used a nice, dense piece of white bread. I cut out a hole with a small jelly glass, melted some butter in a pan, laid the bread down to brown, cracked an egg into the middle, added a pinch of salt and pepper, then flipped it to brown on the other side. Delicious! I don't like runny yolks so I cooked mine till just done. I spread a little grape jelly on the bread and cut a piece of toast and a piece of the egg for the perfect bite. An easier way of eating egg and toast, if that doesn't sound too odd.

This is now one of my favorite breakfasts! So quick and easy. Even my 7 year old liked it (the other wouldn't even try it though) I drop the bread in the pan then the egg right away so I don't get runny whites.

Easy and yummy. I used whole wheat bread and used a glass cup to cut out a large circle since I don't own cookie cutters. After flipping the bread and putting in the egg, I turned down the heat and put on a lid to cook the top side of the egg, but it wasn't cooking fast enough, so I flipped it over. I also added a pinch of salt, moved it to a plate then added freshly ground black pepper and hot sauce.

I've always called these Eggs in a Hole.  One thing I love to do while they're cooking is to heat up some chorizo.  When the Eggs in a Hole are done, top one of them with cheese and chorizo and put the other on top for an incredible flavored and filling breakfast.  Mmm, I could go for a sandwich right now!

This is a classic. I use olive oil on the bread instead butter. It taste pretty much the same and it's way healthier.

I think many of us were surprised (maybe even disappointed) to see a "recipe" that our families have been enjoying for generations appear as a featured recipe here.  Whatever.  Who knows what goes on in the minds of the AllRecipes moderators.  We've always called these One-Eyed Sailors. 
I'm only giving four stars because we like our tried and true method better.  But hey, if this can help just one person, I guess it was worth it.

We call these Eggs in a Basket. Make sure to save the circles you have cut out - for dipping into the yolk. After all the baskets/eggs are done - put on plate, then add 1-2 tsp butter to skillet and 'toast' the circles on both sides. Also remember you can make the eggs overeasy - just flip ithem over and cook for a minute. Yummm.

This is one of my favorite ways to eat eggs with bread (we always called it 'egg in a basket').   Here in Japan one bakery sells them pre-made with mayonnaise, coarsely ground pepper and parsley on top.

5 stars for nostalgia! Been eating these occasionally for 50 years. We call them Popeye eggs, that is what my mom called them. in our version, both sides are buttered well and the egg is cracked into the hole, lifting up the bread to let it go underneath the bread. Both sides get cooked to medium; the cut out piece is cooked too.

My Mom made this when I was a kid using small shaped cookie cutters.  She called it "toad in a hole".  Still have this on occasion, 60 years later.

I have been making this for my kids for 20 years. We call them "Eggs in a Frame" Dont forget to butter the center you cut out and grill that as well. If you cant find a cookie or donut cutter, a jar lid will work fine. I have even scrambled the egg before I put it in the frame for one of my fussy kids who doesnt like the egg "looking" at her. Great for sleep overs. My eldest daughter makes them in college all the time.

OMG;  something so simple to make for the kiddies or grandkiddies. I make these upon request and that is a lot.  My grandkidsr love these as an after school snack with a mug of hot choc.  My Mom made these all the time for us 5 kids growing up in PA in the 50-60's era...good ole days.  We called them "Birds-in-a-Nest".  Egg goes in hole on first side of buttered bread.  We like egg cooked almost semi-hard.

I have been making this for 30 plus years!  We always called it EGG ON AN ISLAND. When my boys were little one liked dippy and one liked fried hard....so I always flipped one of them to harden the yolk.  I can remember making saturday mornings a fun game with this breakfast. One way wasI would strategically place diced potatoes aroud on the plate, just a few. Then I would lay the Egg On An Island off t the side of the plate. The I would take  1 strip of Morningstar Farms Imitation soy bacon and cut it in to 3 sections. They were the boats. My boys had to take their fork and push the boats to the island with out bumping a potatoe. Everytime they touched a potatoe they had to take a bite of the boat and a bite of the Island and eat the potatoe they bumped. The idea was to get a boat to the island before the boats or island was all gobbled up. Once they acomplished that, they got to pick the treat of choices I selected to finish breakfast with. Sometimes it was fruit, but sometimes it was the park or the pool, or shopping for a $3.00 toy or a cartoon movie VHS rental at our local video store. Anyway the breakfast was always ice cold till we were done but they always it it all and had a good time......I loved doing stuff like that with my boys, and hope to be doing it soon with my 19 month old grand-daughter. Thanks for bringing back the memories.

Okay, so you guys must be way better cooks than I am, but I agree with Stinkerbell.  By the time my egg was done the toast was burned on the underside.  So I tried not toasting the one side.  Same result.  Made the hole bigger so the egg would cook faster.  Only marginally better and there basically was no toast.  My suggestion...fry the egg, make the toast and put the egg on the toast.

I do not remember what my mother called them but she had a variation of this recipe.   She used two slices of bread, but added a slice of ham between the layers and cooked the egg in the hole on top of the ham in the oven by using the broiler.  Mom always loved ham and she added it to anything she could.  This was quite tasty and a childhood memory.

I grew up with the name of Fireman's breakfast. The hole was the one the firemen slid down from upstairs and the egg was the gold colored pole they slid down through the hole. I think I learned that 70 years ago!

I've been eating these, what we called "Monster Eyes" for 42 yrs. My first bite was at my best friends house, who is more like a sister to me even now. The only difference is we flip it one more time after the egg is broken into the toast. And we toast the cut outs to dip in the egg. Yummy!

My kiddo loves these, I do too.  We make them a few times a year.  You have to put the egg in when you flip the 2nd time or the toast will burn.  I always toast the middle & eat it too!  It's a bonus.

The first time I had this growing up was while camping with 4-H.  We called them One-eyed Egyptians.  I still make it occasoinally and it takes me back to the woods!!!!  After they're cooked and they're on the plate waiting to be eaten, I'll add more butter to the toast part !!!  Yummy!!!!

Very easy and delicious. My grandmother used to make this for me and my sisters when we were little. She called them "Moon Over Miami's", she did live in Florida though so I suppose that's where the name came from :)

My oldest daughter is in her 40's & I started making "egg in the  hole" for her when she was about 2. Now my girls make it for their children. I use plain white bread buttered on both sides & the center hole cut out with a 2 inch cookie cutter, with a little extra butter in the frying pan... I don't put the egg in the 'hole', until  I turn the bread over, having lightly browned the first side. I'm sure many mothers make their own version of this breakfast treat & all children love it. So do adults, I guess we are all kids art heart, I sometimes make them  on the stove top griddle, as the eggs of a company breakfast, When I have house guests.

We grew up making these for breakfast.  My mother called them popeye sandwiches, but we would use 2 slices of bread, buttered and add the egg in the center of both pieces of bread and fry.  Brings back memories.  These were the best.  Always buttered and fried the center pieces and used them to dip in the center of the egg.

In my family we call this a camels eye. Very little variation. you cut out a hole like it said and butter bread. drop the bread in the pan and put the egg in the hole then you flip it so you end up with a over easy egg or even over medium. my 4 yr old and 6 yr old have love them since they were able to eat solid food. another thing you can do is take two pieces of bread cut a hole in one and butter both. drop both pieces of bread in the pan and the egg in the one with the whole flip when toasted and then melt cheese on one and put it together to make a cheesy camels eye sandwich. Just yummy easy and kids love it because it's wierd with a wierd name "The Camels Eye". Thanks for this recipe! Many people will enjoy

Easy and delicious gets 5 stars. I followed the advice from other reviews and turned the heat down when I added the egg. Low temp worked well, no burning. I used honey wheat bread and toasted the extra circle in the toaster oven. I lightly oiled the pan instead of using butter.  This is great for a light breakfast with a piece of fruit on the side, will make again. I posted a picture of my final product, too.  :)

My kids thought they were ok. If you don't cook them longer than the 2 minutes suggested, they will be runny. I thought it was ok and I probably won't make them again.

These are great. We've had theses since I was a kid but, we called them "Toad in a Hole". I fix them for my grandkids (both girls), and they love them too. Sometime's I'll use a heart shaped cookie cutter.

What a cute idea! I put the toast and eggs in at the same time bec I like it fully cooked. Sprincled some garlic salt and pepper in and topped with some maple syrup.

i can't believe i wasn't the only one looking for the V for Vendetta egg recipe.

 i first saw this in a cookbook a few years ago, and (i swear) it was called "rocky mountain eggs".
 if you put the egg in with the toast, they will finish at the same time.

My dad used to make this for me and my siblings when we were younger. We called it "egg in the toast." He did not brown the bread in the frying pan; instead, he popped it in the toaster so it was lightly toasted, and then he placed the toast in the pan and put the egg in the middle. He would flip the toast once the egg cooked a bit on the bottom. The toast would absorb the butter and it would be nice and crispy, not soggy.

Its a very easy and fun way to make your eggs and toast all in one step. I used wheat bread and I browned the hole cut outs in the frying pan and served it with the eggs for dipping. I've made this many times since I found this recipe. Try it, its fun!

I absolutely love this!!! It's so easy and quick and my 7 year old loves it too.  Sometimes I use 2 eggs when hungry and today added a little feta and Italian seasoning and delic! Thanks so much for posting this - I welcome new ideas for the morning especially!  I use whole grain/bread w/fibre in it and it's so tasty.

It was called Eggs in a Hole where I'm from. I like using 3 inch cookie cutters in different shapes to cut out the hole in the toast, and I fry the little toast "cutout" and serve that up, too!

Always yummy- I usually use a glass turned upside down to make a cookie cutter instead of taking the time to cut holes in  each piece of bread. I suppose you could just use a round cookie cutter too.... Yum.

We have these a lot at our house and they are BIG hits!  We call them "Hole In One's".  Sometimes we crumble up some bacon and sprinkle some shredded cheese in with the egg before pouring it in the center of the bread.  Yummy!

These were super fun. I used a heart for Valentines. I suggest adding the egg as soon as you flip the bread or else the bread will burn in the time it takes for the egg to set. Another hint is to crack your egg ahead of time and place it in a shallow bowl. That way it is ready go and also it will slide out of the bowl easily and fill the hole more uniformly.

This was a really cute recipe. Even though when I made it it was hard to cut a hole in the bread without it breaking, and that the egg didn't really stay inside the bread while eating it, it tasted pretty good. I will have to try this again with a different type of bread to see if it works better.

This is a good and easy recipe I make for my wife and daughters. However I change it and I spirnkle Brown Sugar or Cinnamon to each side of the buttered bread. It adds an extra sweetness to it and more flavor.

We call this Toad in a Hole.  I add the egg right after I put the bread in the pan.  I turn the heat off when I flip it over.  I toast the "hole" along with the rest.

Love this recipe. We've always called them Jim Dandy's. I use a standard juice glass to press down in the center and cut out the hole. Have to use the electric griddle when the Grandkids are here to stay up with the orders.

We have been doing this for years, but toast the bread in the pan on one side first and a little on the second, but we call this egg in the nest.

I grew up calling these Popeye eggs, so that is what my kids call them too. These are awesome with crumbled Bacon (or any kind of cooked meat) and a bit of cheese (I prefer sharp cheddar) as the egg is cooking.  Such an easy and perfect breakfast

Used wheat bread and seasoned the eggs with rosemary, basil, salt and pepper like one user suggested. I added the egg immediately after turning to the second side. My hubby liked them! I want to experiment with other spices or adding cheese.

My 5 year old is eating this as I type...she loves it....and requests it again. Only change is to use whole wheat bread. I dont buy white bread. Delicious, easy and cute for the kids. I found that a small 8oz  mason jelly jar makes the best holes in the bread!

Easy to make and very good. To keep egg from being too runny, would suggest adding egg before flipping for first time. Will definetly make again.

My mom called it "eggs in the middle" and we always looked forward to eating it for breakfast. One was never enough, we always had her make more to satisfy us. I'm glad that I'm able to pass this down to my children (funny how one is never enough). Now that they are much older, they too make it for themselves.

Standard recipe, but totally delicious! I find it hard to get a perfect presentation because my gas stove runs pretty high, but even if I flip it to prevent burning and make sure all the white is cooked--it still tastes just as good even if it looks a bit sad. Try it today! I just made one for myself for a light dinner. I bet you have all the ingredients at home right now (all three of them, haha).

I have made this recipe for over 20 years--but we know it as a Spy-Eye--my children loved the idea of an eye looking through a key-hole.  Even now, friends spending the weekend routinely request Spy-Eyes for breakfast!!

One of the first things I learned to make as a child and now I am into my 60's. 

 Much better if you toast the bread in the toaster then butter the bread before you put it in the pan and put he egg into the hole.

So easy to make!  I made this for my young daughter and she loved it!  I used wheat bread and toasted the bread at the same time I cooked the egg, I also added some butter to the hole so the egg could cook nicely.  Very easy and fun recipe.

Since I did not know how to cook when we were getting married, at my bridal shower I was given a gag gift of a cookbook.....Betty Crocker Cookbook for Boys & Girls Under 12.  In this book it had this very recipe, called "Egg in a Raft."  My bridal shower was 50 years ago, and I still make this for breakfast often!!

My dad used to make this every Saturday for breakfast and I still love it!  I personally hate runny eggs, so I stab mine just after cracking for a nice dead fried egg in the middle.  I love using fun themed cookie cutters, just like my dad did!

I love this! I usually put salt,pepper, and some shredded mozzarella cheese (just a little). I also toast the center that's been cut out in the pan, and dip it in the egg yolk when i'm eating.

We used to have this on Christmas mornings when I was a kid.  My mom would use cookie cutters to make fun shapes in the middle.  Always fun!!  

We never had them over easy, though.  We always flipped the bread while the egg was in it.  It makes one side a little messy, but it tasted great!  :)

Love this!  I am pregnant so not supposed to eat a super runny yolk, so I put the egg in immediately, pop the yolk, let it cook till the other side is toasted and yolk won't go every where when I flip it.  Flip it and cook it more till it has the solidness I need.  delicious!

I grew up calling it "eggs in a nest"  I made it for my Husband for the first time last year.  He love it.  Now he makes silly creations with it.  He will make 2 "eggs in a nest" then sandwiches some cheese and lunch meat between the 2.  It makes A very sloppy but delicious grilled cheese type of sandwich.

I LOVE this recipe! I grew up with it and always cook it as a special breakfast. One fun tip I would give is to fry up the centers that you cut out with the cookie cutter and then place them in a plate of cinnamon sugar to coat both sides! Yum! A "cookie" with breakfast!

I make these, but, my grandmother called them a toad in hole! She buttered both sides of the bread, butter also in the skillet. Cut the middle out of the bread, put the egg in there. She usually would pop the yellow due to the fact alot of my cousins thought the runny yellow was gross! LOL!

We call these Lone Ranger Eggs - kids love em - at least mine did.  The trick is either use butter or bacon drippings and HOT pan to get the toast just right.  Yum - I think I'll go make one right now..

We call these cute dish eggs in a basket or bird in the nest. They became a favorite of my coworkers real quick... You gotta use butter, and watch the heat- med heat is important so you dont burn the egg or the toast. Brilliant!

Good and quick!  I made them two days in a row!  I added basil & some garlic powder which made them perfect!  My husband didn't like how runny they were so the 2nd time around, I scrambled the eggs before pouring them onto the bread.

We grew up with these being called Egyptian Eyes, or Toad-in-the-Hole!   My family enjoys them  browned in bacon drippings for more flavor.  You have to go easy on the bacon drippings, though, and make sure the pan is hot, or the bread absorbs too much fat...

Delicious! We knew this as Eggs in a Basket. My mother used the grease left after frying bacon instead of buttering the bread. Not a low calorie treat, but very tasty!

Suggest toast the bread first. Then, after cutting the hole, if you take your knife and slide it sideways into the toast to hollow it out, the egg will seep into the hollowed toast as it cooks. Awesome!!

I've been making this for years, thanks to my sister's grandmother. We call them Eggs in a Basket. We actually butter the bread, wait for the pan to heat up a little, drop the bread in, wait just a little bit, and then put the egg in, cooking on both sides. Helps to give the bread a bit more flavor as well, and makes a great quick and easy breakfast. My husband loves these. :P

This is actually called, "rocky mountain poached eggs.  When I started making it for my step-son, he called it, "toasbread with and eyeball."  It is great and a simple way to create an imaginitive twist on an old favorite, toast and eggs.

Years ago when I lead a Girl Scout troop, we used to make something similar.  We would take a large can with two opposite holes punched in one end with a can opener, the other end open.  Each girl,  got a pre-made tuna can with cardboard strip wound inside then parafin poured in.  You light the parafin, place the large can over the parafin can, this becomes the stove.  You place two slices of cut bacon on and cook on one side.  Take a slice of bread and bite out a hole in the middle.  Place the bread on bacon & turn when toasted on one side.  Break egg into hole and cook till done.  The kids loved it.  It made a fun project.  Don't remember a specific name for it.

Years ago we made these over the campfire at Girl Scout Camp and called them "egg in a hole".  They were just as good then as they are now.

My mom always made these when my sister and I were growing up, the only difference was we called them "Egg in a Nest".  Sis and I would fight over the middle parts.  Thanks so much for sharing!

As a child in the 50's, my mom made these and called them "Egg in a Hole"!  The circle of bread was also browned and then placed on top of the egg when served.  My sons now serve this to their children.

It's so funny.  Everyone has a different name for this recipe.  We've been making it in our family for years too.  We call them Lone Ranger Eggs.

I've always known this recipe as "HOBO EGGS". We love this and use home made whole wheat bread. We use a shot glass to remove the center and when we turn it the second time, we add chedder cheese.
Fun and Fast !!!

My father used to make these.  He called them "Gas House" eggs.  Said he learned to make them back in the 1920s.  They are fun.

This is an old standard sailor recipe.  Easy to do in a seaway.  Navy method is to fry bacon first, then do the egg thing and serve with two slices of bacon crossed on top = Shanghai Slider.   If you also fry a tomato slice and put it under the bacon, its a Commmie Shanghai Slider!

We've actually been making these for years .. not sure if any of you remember the "Nancy Drew Cookbook" (Heh .. Im old..) but they are in there, and they were called "Hollow Oak Nest Eggs".  I used to love making them as a kid, and still love to, today!

I made this for breakfast this morning for my kids and they loved it! I used a glass with a diameter wide enough to make the hole in the toast and then slightly browned it only on one side over medium-low heat (I think it looks more appealing that way). Then I cracked the egg inside the hole and continued to cook until done. I also toasted the center rounds in the pan and the kids used them as egg dippers. This was a delicious meal! The egg and toast was golden and crispy at the bottom. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing, Viclow!

Have made these for 35 years but we call them "Camel Eyes." Funny how different names come from same thing. We use the bread holes for toast, sopping up egg!  Ummmm good!

My Mother made these for me and my siblings back in the 1960's.  We called them "hole in the middle".  Thanks for the memories.  She always used a drinking glass to make the circle, but a cookies cutter is cute.

i make this all the time, but i do it french toast style. i use texas toast because the slices are cut thicker. cut the center out of the bread and make french toast like you normally would, and crack the egg into the hole as soon as you put the bread on the pan so the egg whites cook through. works best on med low heat. top with powdered sugar and syrup!

Make sure the pan is hot if you want to keep the egg from creeping out from under the bread. We called this egg in a nest growing up. For all those out there who want sunny side up, toast both side of the bread before adding the egg. Reminds me of child hood.

I've always called this Toad In A Hole, but either way it's yummy and super easy. It's not something I make often, and it's always sorta been a non-recipe in my mind it's so easy.

My 3-year-old had one and asked for more. Since I was having this for dinner, I topped mine with a slice of American cheese and a slice of ham that I heated up on the skillet after taking the egg out. It was delicious!

We grew up calling these popeye eggs! My grandfather was a fisherman and would get up REALLY early and he would make these for my brother and I in the mornings...since we loved Popeye the sailor man...he told us these eggs would make us big and strong!! I feed them to my kids and they love sharing the great memory and such a comforting food! ( But we definitely have to flip them once!) We're an over-medium egg family!

This was really neat. We used fat free butter spray to make it much healthier and my husband grabbed sugar cookie cutter to turn the centers into stars, hearts and flowers. Really fun way to serve eggs, my kids wont touch scrambled but they loved these and it brings back memories of my best friends mom making these for us the morning after a sleepover but we called them Peek-a-Boo eggs.

This was a fun way to prepare eggs and toast. Careful of using too much butter, though... mine didn't "toast" up enough, so I had a hard time flipping the bread and egg together.

Never had these before today.  They turned out great!  I toasted the circle that was cut out and used it to dip in the egg yolk.  Next time, I think I will cook the egg through and throw some thinly sliced ham and a slice of cheese on top.

So simple. My family loves these. Sometimes I vary it by melting cheese on top, or adding canadian bacon. So many possibilities with this recipe. Would be great for camping as well.

This is great. I made it today for my first time along with trying it for my first time and dashed a little bit of salt and pepper on top and drizzled some syrup on top. With the extra pieces of bread, I spread butter on them and put it back on the pan for a little while, took them off, and sprinkled some sugar on top or you can even spread jam. Also, if you end up making 2 Eggs on a Boat, you can make a mini sandwich with the left over pieces.

Very yummy.  We pulled out our cookie cutters and made Christmas tree cut outs and hearts.  They were very fun.  My kids like scrambled eggs, so I tried scrambling one, but it was a disaster, so don't try that!  I also threw the little tree and heart cutouts in the pan and browned those up too... very good!

I’ve already made this dish but I made it for the first time again in awhile. I Am a teen and it is very easy for me to make. you don’t need to butter both sides just one and butter the pan for the other side. Don’t forget salt and pepper before you flip it!

Such a fun and easy recipe to make. I made these as a surprise breakfast for my husband. He appreciated the creativity but still prefers his eggs fried normally as he doesn't understand how to eat these, lol. Nevertheless, these were so fun to make.

Perfect way to make this! I like to flip mine as directed so that's it's cooked on both sides. The only issue I have is that the directions call for medium high heat, which is too high to cook this so it's properly grilled. I had my heat on medium.

It was really good, and easy to make. I'm not the person to like sunny side up eggs. I added taste by putting salt and pepper in it. Then I put cheese on top of  it for even more taste. It was really good!

We call this a "toad in the hole"  and my kids always love when I make them
I drop a spoonfull of butter in the center of the hole then drop the egg in the center and toast both sides along with the egg. 
I also toast the "hole cover" as well and place it on top of the egg to serve
The best hole cutter I've found is the lid from any can of spray cooking oil

I sometimes put a little shake of curry powder over it and maybe a little splash of Tabasco on top of the egg

What's not to love!  Super easy breakfast that the kids had a blast with.  You do need to be careful they don't burn so gauge your heat carefully.  I ended up flipping ours so the eggs were cooked all the way through for my kiddos liking.

CLEVER!   What a great way to cook an easy breakfast!   I added the egg as soon as I turned the bread over.  I turned the heat to low and put a lid on to help cook the egg.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely be making this again!

Try it with grilled cheese! It is amazing! Cook the grilled cheese 70% of the way on each side, then do your egg basket thing. If you really want extra amazing, put some bacon in your grilled cheese.

I have been making these since childhood but we call them "eagle-dumps" yes sounds gross but our family has a huge sense of humor.I prefer my egg whites solid not runny so I flip the dump over the egg and cook.cheese is good over top,so many ways to make this.

I cut out close to 3 inches in the center of the bread and had the pan good and hot at med-hot temps. But the egg never seems to cook through. So, I flip and the whole thing busts:( Still tastes good though even if it looks bad and is overcooked.

So easy and I cooked it with plenty of yoke in it (my favorite!). I will defiantly be making these more often. Too bad the rating scale only goes to 5 stars. 10/10 would make and eat again!

Simple and quick meal for when you want something with few ingredients and very little effort- and it's a classic, as well. You might want to make a few modifications to the original recipe, depending on taste and cooking logistics. For instance, I softened the butter for 5-8 seconds in the microwave because refrigerated butter can tear up the bread and then it won't cook right. Also, it might be a good idea to either lessen the cooking time or lower the temperature to medium heat (or flip the bread another time) to avoid the bottom getting blackened as the egg is cooked. (Mind you, it was tasty anyway!)

We've been eating this all my life. My dad called them one-eyed-jacks. For fun, sometimes I use a heart-shaped cookie-cutter instead of a round juice glass to cut the hole (and resulting dipping toast cut-out piece).

This was a childhood favorite when I was a child. My mother was able to get the white solid and leave the yolk runny, which made for a better"Winkie" as we used to call them.  Thanks for the reminder I shall try them tomorrow.

This was a favorite of all us grandkids growing up!  You all should know that the proper name is a "One-Eyed Donnelly" or just "One-Eye" for short! ;)  You can put the hole from the toast over the "eye" as an eyepatch!  It's a great and easy way to create memories for the kiddos!!

Did this for years when our sons were still at home and now do it when the grandchildren visit!  We call it "toasts trouées".  We cook the cut out circle and place it on top of the egg.  We call it its hat!

Great breakfast idea especially when it's the morning before grocery shopping! I made this for my brother and I with four tries, two of.which the egg yolk popped. It's still good either way though. My brother is just picky so I ate the ones that cooked and didn't have a runny yolk.

Loved these.  They were cooked perfect!  Butter both sides of bread.  Heat pan on medium low.  Cook bread on one side for one minute. Put tab of butter in hole and then add eggs.  Lower heat.  Cook with lid on to speed up eggs. Breakup egg whites and poke egg yolk with fork to speed up eggs.  Flip toast and eggs together to cook both sides.  Don't forget to cook the cut out bread circles, too.  Will do sour dough bread next time.  Maybe add cheese....

These are a household favourite! My wife calls it Cowboy Toast. We press down on an upside down juice glass to cut a nice round hole in the center of the bread. Once cooked we drizzle maple syrup over it. A great start to any day!  ":)

I make this recipe without buttering and browning the bread.  Just use a glass to cut out hole, put butter in heated pan and put bread in for a few minutes, then add the egg, then flip.  Yummy!

one morning - in the 60's - my mom said she was making us something new for breakfast. she had it at a friends house the day before - they called it "port holes". you see the lady that fed these to my mom lived on a boat in San Francisco. We have been eating them ever since. I've passed them down to my kids and their kids and their kids. The one thing I do that I have not read in the reviews is after I put the egg in the hole (right after I put the bread in the pan and after I put a small pat of butter in the hole), I use a bread knife to move the white of the egg around so it cooks quicker, then I turn over to cook the other side. I never have runny whites that way. And the type of bread I have used varies by what I have on hand - sourdough, rye, raisin, wheat and of course white. One of the favorites of my family.

For something really delish, use sourdough bread.  This is the way Cracker Barrel does it only they flip it over for over easy eggs and one of my favorites.

We called these eggs in hats when I was little...we fried both sides of the cut out bread circles too and put on top of the eggs ,hence the hats...also in the movie Moonstruck  ,Cher's mother made these for their breakfast (with a piece of bacon on tip) the scene when her fiance calls from Palermo...??

We've enjoyed these for 65 years.  I remember as a little girl my dad making them.  We know them as one eyed Joe's (I still make them).  We've always flipped them over while cooking. Don't forget to toast the circles and place them on top of the egg.  I always use olive oil instead of butter.  They taste just as good.

I loved this recipe, I also added Brussels sprouts to it and made it a sandwich it was good :) You got to be careful on how fast the toast cooks or it wont turn out how its supposed to... 

Sincerly,

My family loves Cracker Barrel's Eggs in a Basket so I tried these, and everyone was very pleased with the results.  I used the outer cylinder of my Pampered Chef Measure-All Cup to cut the holes in the bread and it was the perfect size.  I did have to turn the heat down to prevent burning the bread and overcooking the eggs--so it was more like medium-low, maybe slightly higher than I normally use to fry eggs.  You just have to know your range top--but I think that whether you have gas or electric (coil or flat top), medium-high is going to be too high.  Also, the next time I will try sourdough bread like they use at Cracker Barrel.

I've made this in the microwave.  Toast a slice of bread, butter one side, and cut out the center with a biscuit cutter.  Place on glass plate, drop an egg in the center, pierce the center of the egg with the tines of a fork and cook on Roast for approx. 45 sec. or until cooked to your liking.  Replace the piece of bread which was cut out and top with cream (white) gravy.  Delicious!

We have been eating these for years.  We have always called them Hole n One.  My grandchildren ask for them when they spend the night.  Another thing we do is to dip the bread in an egg/milk mixture like making french toast and then put the egg in the middle.

Its so interesting to see how many people make this and the different names used. When I was growing up it was either called "hats on it" or my favorite "holy egg toast." Thank you for the memory!!

I love making these.  They have many different names. Toad in a hole, one eyed Egyptian or egg in a boat.  Call em what ya want they are just good.  I cook my in bacon grease (not heart healthy) for a little extra flavor. Also toast the piece of bread you cut out for dipping.

Made these over 40 years ago for my children.  I buttered both sides for even browning.  And they called them Moonie eggs because they said they looked like a moon.  These days I spray Pam instead of spread butter.  But still yummie.

My kids both love this recipe. I have used it for years and even as a child we used it as well. I remember learning it in cooking class in Junior High school. We always butter and toast the circle we cut from the middle with lots of butter and my kids dip it in the egg yolk. Yum!

We were introduced to this recipe by my father in law, a true cajun.  He called them "Toad in the hole".

For 60 years I have called these "gashouse eggs" because that's what my family called them.  
There are numerous names in the different regions around the country.  
I don't butter the bread first, I cook butter until it has reached the "browned butter" point and then place the bread and slide an egg into the center cutout.  
I often use sourdough or sheepherder bread and cut out two centers and apply two eggs, for hearty appetites.

I've had this dish since I was a child. We too called it "egg in a basket" but my daughter started calling it "eggies in the middle," and the name stuck. (she also has a song by the same name, that's how much she likes them, lol). I flip ours halfway through cooking since we don't like sunny side up.

I love all the different names for this recipe.  We call it "Egg in a Hole."  My son asks for it at least 2x a week.  I flip the bread/egg and cook both sides in the pan, and I don't break the egg until it's on the plate.  So many variations -- I'm sure they are all great versions!!

Oh, I've always liked these.  My best friend showed me how to make them -- she calls them "one-eyed bread".  I do add salt and pepper though.

A great recipe, very similar to one that my mom made when I was a child and that I continue to make. Mom called the Gausthaus Eggs and the difference was she didn't butter the bread but melted the butter in the pan, added about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and then toasted the first side, flipped it over and added the egg and turned the burner down to let it cook.  Either way, it tastes great.
