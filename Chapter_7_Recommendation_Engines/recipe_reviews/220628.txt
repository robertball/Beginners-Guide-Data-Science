this one's a keeper - the carrots were tasty and looked appetizing.  I used parsley, which was a nice touch (not mint fans, particularly).

Add a pinch of ginger powder and 1 tbsp of brown sugar in place of the white.  We always have this at our Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners!  Never used mint...and probably wouldn't.

I use brown sugar rather than white with a little parsley and Becel, orange juice 1/4 cup works in a pinch too :)

This is a fantastic way to serve carrots, and is a quick and easy recipe. I used 2 teaspoons of maple syrup instead of sugar.

This was really good. the first time I went to make something else and didn't have the ingredients, so when I went to make this I'd had garlic and ginger in the pan cooking already and it turned out good. The second time I made it exactly as stated. I enjoyed it.
