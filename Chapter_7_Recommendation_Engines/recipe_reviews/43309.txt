MADE THIS FOR 4TH OF JULY. IT WAS A HIT. THE KIDS LOVES WATCHING THE DRY ICE SMOKE AND BUBBLE. THE ADULTS LOVED THE TASTE. I USED McCORMICK FLAVORING BUT INCREASED THE AMOUNT, FROM 2 OUNCES TO ABOUT 3 OUNCES. I BOILED 1 GALLON OF WATER,  6 CUPS OF SUGAR, COOLED,WHEN READY TO SERVE ADDED 1 GALLON CHILLED SELTZER WATER, 1 1/3 GALLON WATER, AND 5 POUNDS DRY ICE--NO SUBSTITUTE-- THE DRY ICE GIVES IT THE FIZZ AND THAT ICY TASTE-- WILL MAKE MORE NEXT TIME WE RAN OUT

I rated this 2 stars for 2 reasons, 1 is that the mesurement of the extract is subject to the brand used, some extracts like the brand HOMEBREW only use 4 tablespoons for 4 to 5 gallons water, and the 2nd is for the personal reason that extract = cheat, no knocks intended there just a personal thing, but you may want to tell us want brand to use.

Hi this is Lesa the submitter of this recipe.  There was a typo on the amount of extract to use.  I use 1 bottle (I think 2 ounces) of schilling rootbeer extract.  I can only imagine how awful this is with a full cup.  Sry all!

This was a big hit at our 4th of July party.  Kids and adults alike could not get enough.  We made 4 gallons using about 1.75 bottles (2 oz.) of McCormick root beer extract, 6-2 liter bottles of club soda for half of the sugar we used dark brown sugar.  It had a very rich, yummy flavor.  We also used 10 pounds of dry ice, started off with 5 and it all melted away in an hour.  Got 5 more and it stayed icy until the last drop was drained.  Made it in one of those gatorade 6 gallon beverage coolers.  Excellent!

This was a hit at a July 4th get together. I used a bit more dry ice but I had compliments from every age group on this root beer! Thank you! I used 1 ounce of Lorann's root beer flavor.

It was ok, we made only 1 GAL of root beer.  We cut back the amount of root beer recipe called for still a bit strong.  We served it with homemade ice cream and was very good, but remember root beer will not be carbonated.

The best thing about making it with dry ice is the next morning when the kids can't stay away from the "rootbeer slush" that forms when the dry ice is all used up.

We made this first for my son's Cub scout pack meeting.  The kids thought it was great and the parents kept sneaking glasses of it too.

Since the first time we made it it's now requested at all my kids birthday parties.  We found the rootbeer extract at a local homebrewing supply store.

Definitely use Rootbeer CONCENTRATE, not just extract. We used just rootbeer extract, and it didn't have the nice dark color, or a good taste. Roobeer CONCENTRATE saved the day!

Made this for a halloween party and it was great after I added about another once of rootbeer concentrate and 1/2 c of sugar. Don't judge the taste of it until you add the dry ice, since that adds the carbonation and makes it nice and cold. Plus, it makes for a great "Witches Brew"!

We made this tonight for a church function. We received so many compliments and it was pretty cool to watch = ) Word of advice...do this outside if you're making a big batch! We did use more dry ice than it called for like the other reviews suggested. It turned out really well.

I got a slightly different recipe from an employee of a local dry ice distributor who was giving out samples at the grocery store. He said to make sure to use COLD water or you will need more ice. The warmer the ice, the more it will fog. Perhaps this is part of the problem in not having enough ice??

Good Stuff, I recommend replacing at least half of the sugar with dark cane sugar.  You can also keg and carbonate with homebrew supplies!

The kids had a blast making this and we all thought it was yummy. Especially for younger kids who don't like carbonation.

Really didn't turn out good at all for us. And I followed the recipe to a T.  The dry ice never made it carbonated and it lacked in flavor. I tried adding more extract and sugar in the end, to try and salvage it, but it didn't help enough.  We ended up putting 3 gallons of root better down the sink.

MMMMM!  We made this last Halloween and my kids have already started asking when we are going to make it again.  Super good in rootbeer floats . . . especially when the icecream is homemade too.  Delicious and a lot of fun!

Very fun, very easy, and tastes great! This makes a ton of root beer- if you don't like flat soda, make sure to put leftovers in containers with tight-fitting lids.

We (our family) have made this recipe several times now and it is a hit every single time. Even I had to admit my skepticism was misplaced after the first taste. :) 
We've made it for parties, for fishing trips, and for classroom experiments. The students LOVED the dry ice! We did find however, that six pounds of dry ice made for better carbonation and overall chill factor.

Woowziers. This doesn't taste or look anything like rootbeer.  Smells like it.  I followed the directions to a tee.  I used McCormick extract.  What a disappointment.  If ya'll have an idea where I screwed up ide like to know...

My only suggestion: Use BROWN SUGAR instead! It tastes 100% better and has that brown color you are looking for anyway! :)

Excellent recipe!  I've used this one a few times and I never have issues with it.  Works great!  I do add more dry ice than usual, but we like bubbles.  I added 7 pounds last time.

So fundamentally the recipe is great but I rated it 3 stars to help draw some attention to the problems I encountered.
1. I made this recipe for a church function of 100 or more. I planned on tripling the recipe so I bought 12 lbs of dry ice. It ended up being a waste because the 4lbs mentioned was way more than enough for triple the liquid. (don't buy extra dry ice)
2. I bought the root beer extract and though it is sold in a brown bottle it was clear extract. There was nothing to make the mixture brown like traditional root beer. It was embarrassing trying to explain to everyone why the root beer was clear. (check your extract is brown)

I have made this a couple of times using the McCormick root beer flavoring. My root beer however, is clear. How do you get the dark color?

Made it for the 4th of July and it was a hit. Have used this recipe for Halloween as well and the dry ice bubbling is fun.

Had my grandson over today and made this root beer.  We all loved it!  We used birch root beer flavoring and 8 cups of sugar.  Thank you for sharing this fun recipe and starting a new tradition in our house!
