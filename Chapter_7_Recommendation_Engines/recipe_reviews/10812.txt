This is a very tasty bread. I loved the recipe. Perfect just the way it is.
One reviewer had stated that the breads  are not called pregnant dolls, I come from a traditional Italian family and my Grandmother refered to them as  
"a fertal Goddess" I think in reference to Spring being the time for new life. Which is why we have eggs for Easter. So all names lead to the same great bread.

This sounds just like what I use to make but we called it a "Birds Nest". Still very tasty.
