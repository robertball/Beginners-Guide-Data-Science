I made my own refried beans and  I never was able to find the red tostada shells so I just used the regular ones. This turned out pretty good. I thought the bean and shrimp combo sounded odd but it worked good together. I made my shopping list from the ingredient list so I didn't see the other ingredients mentioned in the recipe description. A layer of shredded lettuce between the beans and shrimp would have been a nice touch. Good recipe though and one I would make again.
