this is a good base recipe however I highly recommend you do the following add 1/2 cup of flour (2 1/2 cups of flour total), add 1/2 tsp of baking powder (1 1/2 tsp of baking powder total), add a tablespoon of bacon grease (reduce butter to 3/4 c of butter), and add 1/4 c of bacon (1/2 cup of bacon total).  also its really important to have this batter chilled so it doesn't spread when you bake it.  my friends LOVED my cookies.  i hope this helps people out.

Okay, let me first say that the only real issue I had with this recipe didn't involve the bacon! :) It was something like eating a chocolate chip pancake with syrup and a side of bacon.  I wasn't put off by it, at all. Just make sure to cook the bacon crisp, crumble and drain well. However, I had to add more flour to this recipe. There isn't a high enough chip/dough ratio as written, to help hold the dough(only I used a mix of white and milk chocolate chips) and my first batch spread so much they LOOKED like the aforementioned pancakes. :) So, I just added another 1/4 cup flour, remixed and refrigerated it for a bit. The rest of the cookies were fine. Even though, as written, these just weren't the right consistency, I'm still giving it a 4 because the flavor which, to be honest, is likely what most folks will question, was good. A very rich cookie with a fun "don't tell them" ingredient. :)

These were very good.  A few changes that I made:  First, I candied my bacon.  Lay out 5 strips of bacon on a foil-lined cookie sheet (preferably one with sides) and sprinkle with light brown sugar (about 2tsp per piece of bacon.)  Bake at 400 degrees, turning once.  Once the candied bacon is cool, crumble into bits.  Also, I could not find maple extract in my grocery store, so I used pure maple syrup that had been infused with cinnamon.  It made the batter delicious!  Lastly, I did not have a stand mixer available when I made these, so I made them by hand.  I let my butter get extremely soft, then whipped it with a whisk for several minutes until it got very light in color.  Then added the other ingredients as called for.  There is a high fat to flour ratio in this recipe, especially with the bacon in it (even if you drain the bacon, there will still be a bit of grease that will get in the batter) so these cookies spread out quite a bit and get very flat.  Next time I might add a little more flour to try and even out the fat/flour ratio.  Overall, a good (and very different!) cookie.

So I love this cookie recipe. With a few adjustments they were exactly what cookie should be. Slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, this controlled the overspread of the cookie. I also used a lot more bacon and chocolate than called for. Instead of using the maple extract I just smothered the bacon in maple syrup and brown sugar when I cooked it.

The only issue with this was that the recipe simply did not call for enough bacon. If you didn't crumble it enough, the bacon bits were few and far apart. I would use equal parts chocolate chips and bacon. :D GO BACON!

These are good as a novelty cookie.  The maple extract added a very nice aroma.  Although I followed the recipe to the letter, the cookies spread more than my normal recipe for chocolate chip cookies, so I made the rest of the cookies smaller after the first batch was done.  I chopped the bacon into bacon bit size.  You really could not taste the bacon in the final product.

I added butterscotch chips in place of the maple flavoring and my husband said they were great. Also, if you crisp the bacon and drain it very well, the cookies will be fluffier.

Best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever.  Best cookie recipe ever.  My friends went nuts over these.  The only thing I changed was I used rum extract in place of the maple because I couldn't find maple extract anywhere and I used an entire bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  You might think that would make them too "chippy" but it did not.  As a matter of fact, I think anything less that a full bag will leave you a little short in the chip area.  Delicious.  The best ever.  Really, reall great.

I candied the bacon with real maple syrup and brown sugar before I added it in, AMAZING! I also substituted maple syrup, added a bit more flour, and refrigerated the dough over night. Resulted in a super chewy cookie. My favorite so far...

I made these while in the mountains for Thanksgiving.  I stored them in a glass container on the counter.  My husband said he wants them in a jar on the counter every day.

OMG!! I got alot of sideways looks offering these but not one complaint. So fun So good. I would go less on the chocolate more on the bacon but that's just me.

I'm so glad that I decided to try this recipe! I am NOT a fan of bacon but I was very intrigued so I just went for it. The cookies turned out great. The only alteration was that I used a full bag of chocolate chips. I'll be making these again.

Great recipe! Like a few people on here I candied the bacon with brown sugar, however I used 10 strips chopped and dropped in a small food processor to get them really small.  I also found that I was out of chocolate chips and had to use 2 grated baking squares instead.  The maple extract isn't my thing so I used a little more maple syrup then it called for and it turned out great! Thanks!

I really enjoy this cookie! I agree with the comments about more bacon...I used just over 1/2 c. and it's still not enough! I think next time I will use equal parts chocolate chip cookie and bacon. I actually rubbed the bacon down with brown sugar before I put it in the oven. I cooked it too long and some of it burned slightly, but I think the crisp actually is better in the cookie.   Also, I didn't use as much butter--about 3/4 c. then I tossed in a bit of the bacon grease...I didn't measure it, but it was probably something like 1.5 tablespoons. I also added more flour and a bit more baking powder in hopes they would rise a bit more--again, no measurements. They still didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  I also pressed a bit of bacon on the top after I tried the first batch and decided it wasn't bacon-y enough.   All in all, I would give it a 5 star rating when I add more bacon and figure out how to make them rise more!

These are good, but there really isn't much bacon flavor which is what i was hoping for. I might try them again and either put more bacon, or perhaps bacon on top. The actual cookie part wasn't the greatest either. I don't mean to sound completely negative. The idea is great and the maple extract was an excellent addition. If I do try these again, I'll tweak them a bit, but I appreciate the discovery!

The cookies were yummy but no bacon taste.  The dough however had nice bacon/maple flavor with the crunch of the bits.  Once cooked, that flavor and the crunch disappeared.    Probably won't make this recipe again

5 stars for a great idea!  Like many others I made a few adjustments to get cookies perfectly suited to our taste.  Added an extra 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 T real maple syrup, and increased bacon bits to 1/2 cup and used only 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chips.  I made smaller cookies and ended up with about 5 doz and baked for only 9 mins.  Perfect-rave reviews from my work and my BF's

I thought these were absolutely delicious. My husband and son just gobbled them up. I think even when I want plain ol' chocolate chips recipe I will just omit the bacon, that's how much I love the flavor! Some cookies had bacon, some didn't, but I really did enjoy the flavor surprise. No complaints here!

Was so good that I got a vegitarian to eat them. She is not a vegitarian anymore! My whole family loved these. I did make some changes. I put in twice the amount of vanilla and maple flavoring, I used less butter (3/4 c.) and added a tablespoon of bacon grease. I also used a whole bag of bittersweet chocolate chips. I also changed the sugar ratio. 1 c. dark brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar. This makes the cookies fluffier and they do not spread as much. Lastly, I used a whole package of thick cut brown sugar bacon. GO BACON!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The chocolate chips overpowered the bacon, and there was not enough bacon/not evenly distributed. I WILL try to make it again, only next time I will double the amount of bacon AND chop it finer so it is more evenly distributed.

These are amazing!! I have made them several times now. I suggest making them as directed by OP to see how you like them first and then tweaking them to your preferences the next time. I now use an entire package of bacon and try to leave decent sized chunks of bacon so you can get the flavor coming through with each bite. In fact, these are so good, I had an ex boyfriend, who is basically bacon intolerant, eat so many that he almost had to go to the ER - he liked them that much!!! lol Everyone who eats these cookies LOVE them.

As a college student who was stress baking, this recipe is A MAZ ING!! Very simple and tastes great! I used microwave made bacon and instead of vanilla or maple extract I just used regular pancake syrup!

This is a novel recipe and it deserves points for that, but I've certainly had better cookies.  The overall flavor is lacking and really needs a boost.  Neither the bacon nor the maple flavor comes through in these.   The recipe needs some tweaking.

I didn't have maple extract, so I added maple syrup until the batter was mapley enough. I now have the extract, so looking forward to making them again. I may up the bacon quotient.

UPDATE: Made them a second time with about double the bacon and using maple extract. Sad to say, they're still not super-maple-flavored (although I'm happy with the bacon content now.) Next time, I may glaze the tops of the cookies with some maple syrup while they're drying, or add a maple icing.

I too can only give this a 4 because iof the modifications that needed to be made to the recipe, but these are good cookies. Very easy to make. I did add an additional 1/2 C of flour and upped the bacon to 1/2C as well. Next  time I would leave the bacon in larger crumbles because the bacon flavor really didn't shine through. I refrigerated the dough for about 20 minutes then rolled it into 1 inch balls and placed 12 balls on the cookie sheet at a time and baked them for 13 mins.  They came out perfectly round and uniform and it yielded 4.5 dozen cookies. I will be making this recipe again!!

They were so thin and spread out way too much.  After the first batch came out of the oven, I added 1/3 cup flour to the remaining mix and chilled the dough.  The next two batches were much better.  Didn't find these to be very maple-y and I would have added more bacon.

I did not care for this recipe.These cookies turned out like sticky, crispy pancakes. Please use at least one extra cup of flour when you try to make them!
