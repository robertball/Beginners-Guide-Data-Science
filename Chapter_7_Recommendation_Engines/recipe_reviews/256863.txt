We halved the  amount of honey but felt it was too sweet and my wife thought it was too hot/spicy. So be careful with this one - it's good if you like Sriracha heat. It is a quick recipe to make and easy to clean up if you use foil in the broiler, but depending on the thickness of your fish it may be done with 5 minutes a side or less.

This had too much sriracha for my taste. It brings some heat even with the honey. Maybe leaving out the jalape√±o would help a bit
