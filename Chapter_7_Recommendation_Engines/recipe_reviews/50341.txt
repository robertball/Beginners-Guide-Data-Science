This was sooo yummy!!! I did make the following modifications - used 2 cans of sour cherries, and cut the sugar/flour in half.  Put in an 8x8 pan.  I cut the topping in half and took out the shortening completely (not sure why you would want to add unnecessary trans fat).  Also, I used salted butter, which I'm sure helped give the topping its great flavor.  This ROCKS with Blue Bell vanilla ice cream.

My rating is for the following modifications: I used a bag of Trader Joe's frozen cherries and berries (about 3 cups) because that was all I had and reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup for the fruit mixture. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon over it. I did not use the shortening! You only need 1/2 cup of butter for the topping or it will be greasy. Shortening has no place in a recipe like this. I look forward to trying it with the sour cherries next time.

This turned out pretty good.  I did have some slight changes.  I didn't have enough frozen cherries so I added half the amount in frozen peaches.  The peaches and cherries tasted great together and complimented perfectly!  I didn't have any shortening so I used 1 c butter.  The cooking time seemed right on.  All in all the only thing I would change would be to cut down on some of the topping.  There was just a bit too much so you didn't taste as much fruit as I'd like to, just a mouth full of sugar!  I would say cut the topping by 1/4 or even 1/3.  I'm going to experiment to find which is best.  Oh also, I had a little juice spill out so it got burnt on the coil.  It smelled AWFUL!  Just in case, I'd lay down some foil underneath.

Very good, and simple!!

I used all butter instead of half butter, half shortening.  I also added 1 TB almond oil to the fruit and 1 tsp almond oil to the crumble.

I used half fresh cherries and half fresh blueberries for a wonderful combination.  Also, before I topped the fruit with the crumble, I added 4 pieces of Neufchatel cheese (1 TB each) to the top of the fruit.  Then, I topped with the crumble and baked.  The cream cheese gave it a danish-like taste.

The crisp was delicious and everyone LOVED

I tried this recipe when I realized that I had 2 cherry trees in my back yard and an abundance cherries. I made this with fresh cherries, of course, and it turned out wonderfully. It was such a hit that I ended up having to make 3 more for my friends. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!!

This recipe is awesome!  There is no need for 1/2 cup of shortening.  I used more than 4 cups of cherries. I served this with whipped topping, but will be sure to serve it with vanilla ice cream next time.

So delicious!  I used a one pound bag of frozen sweet dark cherries from Trader Joe's.  (And cut the recipe in half).  Since they were sweet cherries, I omitted the white sugar.  For the topping, I used mostly whole-wheat pastry flour.  I don't use shortening, so I used all butter, (a little less than called for) and melted it before mixing it in.  Added just a little cinnamon too.  With my changes I give it five stars.  I'll be making this again soon!

I picked sour cherries at my neighbors and pitted them. This is a great recipe for the filling. The crust is not as crumbly as I would like. With the crisco it makes it clumpy, good, but not what I wanted. I like the Apple Crisp II topping.  #  1 cup quick-cooking oats # 1 cup all-purpose flour # 1 cup packed brown sugar # 1/4 teaspoon baking powder # 1/4 teaspoon baking soda # 1/2 cup butter, melted  #  Combine the oats, 1 cup flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and melted butter together. Crumble evenly over the apple mixture. # Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes.

Yum! My friend gave me some cherries. So I was looking for a recipe for fresh sour cherries and ran across this recipe, and so glad I did! I used 5 cups cherries because that was how much I had.I added 1/2tsp. cinnamon to topping and used all butter, no shortening. Delish! Thanks Gail!

My family had requested that I make cherry crisp for a summer cook-out, and use some of our freshly-picked cherries.  I followed this recipe exactly, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about it, and I only got one spoonful at the end of the day!

As written, this gets three stars simply because every component tastes great!  However...this is seriously not enough cherries and WAY TOO much topping.  This is coming from someone whose favorite part of a fruit crisp is the topping.  Since I have a large family and will need the 13x9 pan, next time I will use closer to 5 cups of cherries, and about 1/2 to 2/3 the topping.  Probably closer to 1/2.  Like I said though, the crisp was great, and the cherries were great, but they were hidden!  I still can't wait to try again!

I've made this twice now and it was a huge hit both times.  My oldest son was hovering over it while it cooled when I made it for a party last night!  I used 2 bags of frozen, no sugar added, sour cherries from Safeway.  Followed the directions just as they are with the frozen cherries and it turns out wonderfully!

LOVED IT! I made some changes others suggested and incorporated my own. I ended up with more cherries and less topping: 4 and 1/2 c cherries (I used frozen), 3/4 white sugar, 1/4 cup tapioca (instead of flour) and 1 t vanilla. For topping, 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c rolled oats,1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar. Leave out shortening. Bake in 8x8 or 9x9 for 50-60 minutes. Less topping and more cherries make me a happy girl. Serve with vanilla ice cream. My hubby ate three helpings on his go-round.

This was delicious and what a great way to use the fresh cherries that are in season! It is true that this makes a lot of topping, but I like it like that so it didn't bother me. You could half the topping and add more cherries if you like it heavier on the cherry side.

I only used 1/2c sugar with my fresh (not sour) cherries, and it was WAY too sweet.  omitted the shortening, cut flour down to 1 cup, and added almonds on top for the last 15 mins. It looks delicious and the topping is pretty good. If you aren't using sour cherries, maybe you only need a few tablespoons of sugar to make it palpable.

This was just ok for me.  It needed a lot more oatmeal and a lot less sugar.  The topping tasted like mostly sugar with a hint of oatmeal and there was way too much topping and not enough cherries. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  I also reduced the sugar in the cherries by half because I used sweet cherries instead of sour.  Next time i'd reduce the topping by half, double the cherries and add more oatmeal to the mix.

Very good. I used cherries fresh picked from my grandparent's cherry tree. The only thing I did different was use 6 cups of cherries instead of 4. I made two of these, one with 4 cups and one with 6 cups, giving the one with 4 cups to a friend. I used 6 in my family's because there was a lot of topping and I had way too many cherries, and I thought it would be better if it was a little thicker. 

Oh and also I heated up the cherries, sugar and flour before I baked it so that it wouldn't be so runny. Just brought them to an almost-boil so it thickened it up a little =]

Really good. I used regular bing cherries and used only 3/4 cup sugar and it was still great. I may even reduce to 1/2cup next time. Makes a lot of crisp, I could have used another cup or so of cherries for the fruit part. First time making a cherry anything. Hulling them was really a labor of love, but worth it.  If you have a convection oven, turn down the heat and start checking for doneness about 15minutes ahead of time.

Rave reviews.  I too cut both sugars in half and did not add the shortening - did not add more butter either.  It came out great with just the right amount of crispness and sweetness.

This was my first time baking with cherries, but I'll certainly try it again.  Wish I had read through the comments and reduced the amount of sugar, but will do that next time. The bin of cherries from the farm stand was more than 4 cups, so I just tossed them all in.  This is a CHERRY crisp after all.  I wondered about the shortening in the topping, but went with the flow.  Sometimes we get a bite of that shortening in the topping and it is just icky.  Will keep this recipe on file but skip the shortening.

This was good, but I found the topping to be a bit thick.  I may make this again, but will probably increase the cherries and decrease the topping. It was very tasty with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.

I really enjoyed this dish!  I only had 3 cups of cherries on hand so I substituted 1 cup of blueberries. It turned out beautifully.  I love the way the tang of the fruit is not over powered by the crisp mixture. I will definitely make this again

I made these in six individual dishes as my husband and I really shouldn't eat the whole recipe at one sitting - and it was good enough that that would have been tempting.  By making it in small dishes I was able to freeze extra.    I made the topping in the food processor, grinding the oatmeal fine and used all butter. It tasted like shortbread.  I only used half the topping, put the rest in a ziploc bag and held it in the refrigerator for next time.  I made this twice - the first time I used Splenda as another reviewer suggested. Yuck!  I don't use Splenda but someone had left a box in my kitchen and I thought it would be a good idea to use it up.  I followed the instructions to use it in the same quantities as sugar but it turned out way too sweet and to me it had an aftertaste.  I'll never try that again.

This is FANTASTIC!!  I made this exactly as written, with the exception of the 9x13 pan.  Mine were all in use, so I simply put it in an 8x8 pan.  Some of the crumbles on top were a little powdery because they didn't contact the cherry juice, but it was still absolutely delectable.  If you decide to use a smaller pan, I might recommend not using all the crumbles, or cutting that part of the recipe to 3/4.  Regardless of how you make it, you won't be disappointed.

Very good.  However, since I used sweet cherries, I decreased the sugar to only 1 C. and added lemon juice.  For the topping, I only used butter and no shortening.  Next time I make this, I will add water to the cherries as they didn't come out as juicy as I had hoped and I would not use the oats for the topping...  personal preference.

This was really easy.  I used all butter instead of butter and shortening.  Also used tart cherries because that is what I had on hand. I felt like something was missing.  My cherry pie recipes calls for almond extract so I may add that next time or some cinnamon like in apple crisp.

This was great!!  I made a few modifications according to what others said.  I didn't have enough frozen cherries, so I used frozen blueberries to have a total of four cups fruit.  (I will have to try the cherries/peaches combination someone suggested.)  I also did not use the shortening in the topping, and did not use all the topping that was suggested.  Before I baked it, I sprinkled a little sugar/cinnamon mixture on top.  This was absolutely one of the best crisps I have ever made, and will definitely make it again!!

An excellent choice for our July 4th celebration. Easy to fix!  I did add slivered almonds to the topping as one reviewer suggested.  Perfect.  And I added almond extract to the cherry mixture. Thanks for an easy and tasty dessert.

This was delicious!  I did cut back on the sugar just a bit - I used just one cup.  I also used tapioca in place of flour for the thickener.  I will make this again.

Being the first time I've made my own cherry crisp.. I followed the recipe but subbed the shortening for a full cup of butter and cut back a 1/2 cup of sugar.. still, I felt so guilty eating this, using 2 CUPS of sugar, even with cutting back it came out still too sickeningly sweet.. I would have much rather preferred the sweet tartness of the cherries without all the sugar coating of this dish.... I will keep that in mind next time to use only the 1 cup of brown sugar for the topping.

Really good.  I used canned cherries and made 1/2 a batch.  I then baked in individaul ramekins.  They turned out great and were a delicious dessert to our Christmas dinner.

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly (only because I don't believe in giving a review of a recipe that I make changes to) and it was delicious!  Some of the sugar did stick to the bottom but I probably would not change the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good I made it twice (good cherry year) and it worked out well both times.  I did add two more cups of cherrys and melted the better before I mixed it into the crumble.

This is my first year of sour cherries and my first attempt at a cherry crisp.  It turned out WONDERFULLY!!  I didn't have enough for the full recipe so I cut it in half and cooked it in an 8 x 8 glass baking dish.  I took the others' suggestions about the shortening & instead used 1/3 cup butter when I cut the recipe in half.  I also sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top before I baked it.  I'll DEFINITELY make this again.

Our sour cherry tree actually had fruit last year thanks to our puppy who thinks he's a cat (shoo birds!). This recipe came to our rescue as we had buckets and buckets of cherries to deal with. It tasted great. Thanks for the recipe

The recipe is as delicious as it is simple.  I made it for a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used bing cherries (almost 5 cups)in place of the sour cherries and cut the amount of sugar to 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons.  I also added sliced almonds to the topping (about a handful).  The topping is plentiful which helps to ensure the juices don't escape through it.  I plan on making it again for the 4th of July weekend.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used about 5 cups of fresh picked, pitted sour cherries.  Used less sugar on the cherries, about 1 cup.  On topping, I used only 1/2 cup margarine, no other shortening, less flour and sugar,  and about a cup of oatmeal.  It came out wonderful.  We are trying to use less sugar, and the cherries didn't need to be so sweet!  Very good recipe!  I'm tasting it so hot, right out of the oven! Haha

I think this was perfect as is! I used fresh cherries cut in half and pitted. Easy to assemble in a 9x13 pan and great proportion of fruit to topping. I used a pastry cutter, then a fork to cut in the butter and shortening, but it was room temperature so I ended up just using my fingers until crumbly. Very easy and very yummy! Everyone loved it including my picky daughter who said she didn't like cherries. Great served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream too!

I made this using fresh sour cherries. We enjoyed it, but I felt the ratio was backwards--it was about 1/3 fruit, 2/3 topping. I like my fruit crisps a lot heavier on the fruit. Oh, and I baked it in a 10-inch square pan; I don't think the cherries would've come close to filling a 9x13-inch dish. I cut the sugar in the filling to about 1 1/4 cups, and in the topping to 3/4 cup since I like some tartness in fruit desserts. I added a pinch of salt to the filling and topping, too, and used all butter (about 3/4 cup). Tasty with ice cream.

I took the advice and reduced my sugar to a little less than a cup.  I used approximately 5 cups of cherries and wished I had used more!!  I will use more like 7 cups next time!

This was good buy wasn't crispy. I think the oats soaked up too much of the liquid. I increased the amount of cherries based on prior reviews. Flavor was good but the texture wasn't what I was looking for.

Good, but maybe too sweet.  I used fresh tart cherries and found that in a 9x13 pan I needed closer to six cups to fill up the pan.  Otherwise it was great.  I used one cup of butter instead of shortening and added a dash of cinnamon in the crumb mixture.

I only gave this 4 stars because I don't believe in using shortening over butter.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour and added almond extract to the cherry mixture.  Also - I added chopped walnuts to the topping - really gave it a texture instead of being all soft and mushy.  Will make again.

This is a winner.  My parents visited when I made this and my Dad told me it reminded him of his Mom's crisp that she made when he was younger.  This recipe keeps the tart flavor of the cherries and has that wonderful crisp on top too.  We loved it!!!

Holy sugar overload. There was so much sugar with the fruit it was crunchy. I used fresh cherries and blueberries and could have cut the sugar in half. Too much topping, also with too much sugar  The second star is only because my co-workers raved about it. I have quite a sweet tooth and found it impallatable, but the masses said yay.  It has tasty potential with all that fresh fruit but just way less sugar.

Really great recipe! I don't have shortening, so I used another half stick of butter. Added a little lemon juice and zest, sprinkled with lots of cinnamon. With or without ice cream, this one's a keeper. Oh yeah, fresh cherries all the way.

I tried this recipe this weekend and it was good, but not fantastic. I adjusted the amounts of the ingredients a lot. I used about 3c each of cherries and blueberries, cut the sugar in the fruit to 1c, cut the brown sugar in the topping to 3/4 and eliminated the shortening entirely. I also added a little vanilla to the fruit. Plus, I baked it in a 9x9 pan. I think the key to this recipe is to: 1. Use it as a guideline 2. Adjust sugar amount to your taste 3. Eliminate the shortening

This was great!  Like other reviewers, I left out the crisco and only used 1/2 a stick of real butter. I also cut way back on the sugar in the filling. I used one can of dark red tart cherries and one can of royal anne cherries (no pie filling).  I added cinnamon and pecans and it came out perfectly!

Excellent!  This is the second time I've made it, and it is a pleaser for adults and children.  I agree with others,  the shortening is definitely not necessary.

Well the crumble was great and overall the recipe is great however I used sweet cherrys since thats what I had in the freezer. I cut down sugar to 1 cup but wish I would have cut it down even more. Next time I will try 1/2 cup or less.

Great tasting cherry crisp! I did replace the white sugar with maple syrup to make in more healthy and I did not use the crisco again for health reasons. 1/2 cup butter was plenty for the topping. Thanks for the recipe.

My mummy makes Cherry Crisp and I wanted to but she wasn't around and I couldn't find her recipe, so I turned to Allrecipes! I (and the lovely guests) loved this piece. I had to cut the flour as one was allergic, and I added tapioca, to make it hold together more, but otherwise, the same. Yum. Eat with Blue Bell vanilla ice cream.

Although it needed a few alterations. Cut sugar to 1/2 cup. It also had way too much topping.  Could probably cut it in half.

Overall this is a great easy recipe. It was just a little too sweet for my preference so I may reduce the brown sugar & the regular sugar by half next time.

YUM!  Made this using one can of sour cherries, almond extract, splash of lemon juice and I had some dried cherries, threw in a couple of handfuls.  The BEST crisp I have ever made.  Boy it was rich..should have topped it with some vanilla ice cream just to cut the sweetness!!  Will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  I like a lot of topping so this was perfect. The whole family loved it.  A great way to use the cherries off our cherry tree.  I've made this twice in about a week's time.  I use all butter and omit the shortening.  The second time I made it I did cut the sugar back to 1 cup in the filling.  The full amount was a tad too sweet for me.  I will be making this every cherry picking season from now on.

Edited to add that I’ve started adding  another cup of cherries.  Helps cut the sweetness plus there seems to be more topping than cherries in the original recipe. A few extra cherries solves this problem.

Delish! I 1 1/2'd  the cherries. (I used frozen sour cherries) I decreased the white sugar to 1 cup. And I cut the crumble topping in 1/2 and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I also assembled and then froze an extra pan. Came out perfect freezer to oven.

I was given a bag of fresh sour cherries and found this recipe. I just pulled this out of the oven, and it is delicious.  Very easy to put together.  I did not use the half cup of shortening that the recipe calls for and next time I will cut down on the topping probably by half.

Since I used fresh cherries (about 5 cups), I reduced the sugar added to the cherries to 1/4 cup. I made the full amount of topping, but used only about three-fourths of it, and even that was too much. It sort of overwhelmed the taste of the cherries. I would agree with other reviewers that even if you like the topping best, reduce the topping in half - that is plenty!

I halved this recipe, but mine came out with the sugar still grainy. I creamed the butter and sugar as directed for the topping, however, it was the butter in the cherry flour mixture that was gritty, I think. Any suggestions? We will still eat it. Thanks Arandygail.

I made this for my guinea pigs--I mean, co-workers at the peak of cherry season, following all the instructions...EXCEPT: I used coconut flour rather than wheat flour to make it gluten-free. The results were great-my co-workers loved it and I received many compliments. The only thing is, I've never used coconut flour before, so in the future, I might cover it with foil to keep it from getting too dark in the oven.

This was yummy!  I did modify it a little bit, as I wanted to use up all my fresh cherries.  I used about 6 cups of fresh cherries (next time I will cut them into halves instead of using full cherries...makes them easier to eat!).  The topping was right on the money for a 9 x 13 pan.  I took it out of the oven exactly within the time on the recipe, but I wish I had left it in for a few more minutes so the top would be more crispy.  The taste was sensational though, will definitely make again!

The cherry crisp for very tasty.  I did not give it a 5 only because I would totally the 1/2 cup of shortening unnecessary.  That made it too oily and did not add to the flavor.  The half cup of butter would have been the right amount in my estimation (without the shortening part). I would also increase the oats to 1 1/4 cup because it did not completely cover the top of the pan.  I did add chopped walnuts to the topping.  Overall, very tasty and easy.

Made this for work and got rave reviews. Fresh cherries were out of season, so I used some frozen dark ones and it was awesome. Just enough left over for breakfast the next day.

Very yummy!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and just took out the shortening completely (didn't sub anything for it), using only 1/2 c. butter and it turned out PERFECT. I can't imagine it needing another 1/2 cup of fat. It was very moist without.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was. I was very hesitant when I started because of the amount of sugar. I now wish I would have cut the sugar in half. it was WAY to sweet, and there is to much topping compared to cherries. It would be ok cutting back on the sugar.

This was the best recipe for crisp I have found! I didnt' have any old fashioned oatmeal on hand, so I used instant oatmeal packets (3)and I only used 1/2 cup butter, no shortening. A little bit of cinnamon was added too. I think next time I will only make 1/2 of the topping, i didnt' use all of it. I did use sweet cherries and only 1 cup sugar instead of the entire amt. It was perfect!

Delicious! I think it's great as is and wouldn't change a thing. I have made it with all butter before (no shortening) and it was great that way too. We loved it.

I have never had fresh cherries baked in a dessert...just the ol' stand-by, canned cherries.  I was looking for something different and I LOVED the fresh cherries in this.  I also decreased the sugar by about a 1/4 cup and it was PERFECT served with icecream.

I just LOVED the topping.  I couldn't find the right fresh cherries, and had to go with frozen, which wasn't as good as I had hoped.  I'm still giving this a 5 since I think it was my fault going with frozen sweet cherries instead.

this was pretty good, served it hot with vanilla ice cream.  used cherries from the tree we have out back, so they were maybe a little too sour for this recipe?  i think i might try something else next time, but still very good. very easy to make.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I took another reviewers advice on lessening the sugar, since I was using Bing Cherries.  I also took another reviewers advice and added some frozen peaches.  I loved it with these changes.

This was my first attempt of baking with fresh cherries, and it was wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half since there were only 2 adult and 2 children eating it.  I used 2 1/2 c. cherries and added a tsp. of cinnamon to the topping.  Very good!  I think next time I will add even more cherries.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!!

I used fresh cherries and added a bit of coconut to it.  It added a lovely texture and the flavors went well.  As for the extra topping I added slivered almonds and i put it in a cake pan and baked it off as well.  We saved it and put it on our ice cream.

Very Good!  The only change I made was to cut back a little on the brown sugar.  I wanted to make sure the tart cherry taste came through and it did.  I will make this again!

This recipe was okay, but nothing spectacular. The flavor was fine, but I think I will try it again with more fruit and less topping. I like a very fruity crisp, and in this recipe the crisp topping overwhelmed the fruit. Still, I took it to a BBQ and good good reviews on it.

I love picking cherries from our little tree in the backyard.  This year, we had a bumper crop.  My husband and I picked the Montmorency cherries on our anniversary, and I made this recipe for his parents.  They can't get out much -- don't drive any more.  But they just loved having a fresh cherry crisp.  Even ate it for lunch one day.  We just picked another 7 cups or so -- and we'll have it again on Father's Day.

After a long day of picking and pitting 3 gallons of sour cherries, I needed a quick but appealing recipe.  This is a wonderfully quick recipe that produces great results.  The combination of the crunchy sweetness of the topping and mild tartness of the cherries made for a great finale to my meal.  Of course a big dallop of whipped cream only added to the dessert.  It was quite popular with all of my family and will be made again!  Thanks Gail!

This was a great way to use those farmer's markets' fresh sour cherries that come along only too infrequently.  The crisp topping works really well with the sweetened tartness of the baked cherries.  I'm sure this would be good with ice cream, but it didn't last long enough for us to try it that way!

The only changes I made was a suggestion by another reviewer for the topping, which was fantastic. Apple Crisp II topping: 1 cup old fashioned oats, 1 cup flour, 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 cup melted butter.

This is sooooo good. I have a cherry tree, and so always have fresh or frozen cherries around. Both work great. 
I use all butter. Between my husband and I, we can take down a pan of this within a couple days. He loves it just as much as I do.

Really good. I added 1 cup of sugar (recipe calls for 1 1/2) and it is still a little sweet so would probably adjust the sugar to 1/2 cup for my taste. Added 1/2 tbsp vanilla to cherry mix, a pinch of salt and added about a 1/2 tbsp cinnamon. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the flour/oats mix and instead of shortening I added 1/2 cup plain applesauce. I also drizzled a little coconut oil to the top just before baking. I will make this again when I have fresh cherries I need to use. Thanks for the recipe!

I make a lot of fruit crisps.  I always use fresh fruit to make them. This is a good base recipe, but required a lot of changes.  First, use only 1 cup of sugar to cover the fruit.  Second, use only 1 cup of flour for the crumble topping, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of oats.  Eliminate the shortening and use only butter.  This created a nice balance of sweet and tart.  By using all the sugar included in this recipe you would completely overshadow the sourness of the sour cherries.  If I had followed this recipe exactly, I probably would have only given it a 2 or a 3 because it would have been way to sweet.

This is a delicious crisp- used 4 cans of sour cherries since I cannot find any fresh sour cherries in our area.  Made it even easier to use the cans since they were already pitted. Also, I substituted another 1/2 cup of butter for the shortening, and the result was a outstanding topping that I will use with other fruits.

Delicious (and vegan)!  Took recommendations from others and used half the sugar and no shortening.  Instead of butter i used 1.5 sticks of Earth Balance vegan buttery stick and you don't even notice.  

Used 8x8 pan and had so much crust that i lined the bottom of the pan with crust and still had so much for the top.  Thought it was too much, but for me there is never too much crust.  Just dumped it on top and it came out awesome.  Also threw in some cinnamon, nutmeg and anise in the crust.  

Sweetness was just right, perhaps could've just used 1/2 cup sugar instead of the 3/4 c for more tart flavor.    Very easy to make - hardest part was pitting the 2+ pounds of cherries!

It is good, but definitely way to sweet, out of a family of 7 only one of the children didn't complain. And you know it is really sweet when children complain. I think I will try the recipe again just try to cut out some sugar.

This is O.K.  I found the other modifications to be spot on.  It needs a lot less sugar, and a lot more fruit.  For fresh cherries either half the sugar or double the fruit.  The topping was also too much, although if you double the fruit it would probably be perfect.  Otherwise, it was good, and I would try it with any kind of fruit.

Good stuff!  Just moved into our new house last January.  Noticed a North Star Cherry Tree growing.  Just picked the berries and made this crunch.  Good stuff!!!  Did I mention that this is really good stuff?  Because if I failed to let me just say...good stuff!

This was fantastic!  I served it as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving and more people wanted this than pumpkin pie.  I used canned cherries.  Next time I'm going to cut out the shortening from the topping, and probably throw in some more oats.  I ate the leftovers for breakfast!

This recipe has all of the benefits of a cherry pie with none of the fuss.  So simple and yummy.  Best when served warm and with vanilla ice cream.  I did substitute 2 tablespoons of flour with cornstarch because I was using frozen cherries and they tend to have more juice.  Perfect.

this crisp was fantastic!!! the topping was sort of cake-y after it was baked, but still delicious. i tried what a few other reviews said and only used 1 cup of sugar and put in maybe a cup more cherries than the recipe suggested. I chose not to put in the cherries with the sugar and flour mixture, and ended up rolling the cherries in it and lining the pan with them. then i just poured the excess sugar/flour over the top of the cherries. My only complaint is how quickly it ran out!

This is delicious, but I made it a little more healthy:  I used a fresh berry medley of  sweet cherries, tart blackberries and blueberries, so I cut the fruit sugar to 1/4 cup.  Then I cut the crisp recipe to 2/3 and replaced the shortening with 1/4 cup of applesauce to make it more healthy.  Came out great!

My biggest complaint is I think it really needed more cherries in a 9 X 13 pan and that was with having about 4 1/2 cups in it. It seemed to be all topping to me? Maybe I should have cut back on the topping as one reviewer suggested? Anyway, I had sweeter fresh cherries too, so I cut back the sugar to 3/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown. I also used all butter in the topping and cut it back to 3/4 cup. I sprinkled cinnamon in the topping too. Mine did not take 45 minutes to be done. It was nearer to 30- 35 minute mark, so keep an eye on it. I think the topping was a little overdone on it even at that, but still really good.

I prepared this recipe as directed and was not impressed.  I decided to try it because of the great reviews, but wish now that I would not have wasted the ingredients:( The crisp was way, way to sweet, there was too much topping for the amount of fruit, and why the recipe calls for shortening-I'll never know--it just makes a greasy, slimey mess--YUCK! I have made many a cherry crisp and this one was the worst--sorry.

I used fresh sweet cherries, whole-wheat flour and no shortening. I omitted the white sugar completely, and it turned out plenty sweet. I did add cinnamon as suggested, and it was a nice touch. This recipe does make far too much topping. We probably had nearly an inch on top of the fruit. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. It was well received.

Wow!  This cherry crisp is fabulous and easy to make!  I made this recipe as directed for the most part.  The only change I made was that I omitted the shortening.  The topping was perfect without the shortening.  My family gobbled it up and asked for more!  What a great way to use fresh sour pie cherries!

This was pretty good.  I didn't use shortening though and it was still tasty.  You could use any fruit for this recipe.  I also melted the butter and poured it over oat mixture.  Just make sure you drizzle enough butter over all dry ingredients, otherwise the flour stays too "floury".  I should have used a little more than 1/2 cup butter for that.

Very Very yummy. I used 1.5 bags of frozen sour cherries a halved the recipe for the topping. This made a great dessert in a decorative pie pan. Will definitely be making again!

I was looking for a "crisp" topping for my mixed fruit (peaches, apples & berries). I used all margarine instead of the shortening.  I thought this was the perfect amount of topping for 5 cups of fruit in a 9 X 13" pan.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this!

Love this recipe! Tastes awesome. I wasn’t sure how the sour cherries would taste from the trees in our backyard and I was happily surprised! My only complaint is that the crumble part does clump. Maybe the shortening caused that? (I might try varying the ingredients in the crumble.) But really this recipe tastes perfect as is! Loved it.

My family loves tart cherries and I like to make crisps more than pies.  I have been using this recipe for years BUT with the following changes:  I use half the amount of white sugar in the cherries (too sweet!).  For the topping, I make sure to use Crisco Butter for the shortening and also add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt to the topping mixture - more flavor!  I prefer to use an 11x7 baking dish as the 13x9 spreads the crisp out too thin.  One of our favorite desserts if we have tart cherries!

Excellent recipe, I gave it 4 stars as I did cut the sugar to 1 cup for the cherries and only 1/2 cup brown sugar for the topping.  I cut the flour to  1 cup and did not use the shortening. I melted the butter. This is a recipe you can easily play around with to make to your personal taste.  Oh, I also used 5 cups of cherries instead of 4.

Only good with adjustments. Do not use shortening, halve the topping. Halve the sugar, add tsp of almond extract to cherries.

the crumb to fruit ratio is WAY off.  I used 5 cups of fruit and it was WAY too dry.  Its worth trying again but more fruit and half the crumb topping.  Butter Pecan ice cream saved this dish.  And used it for breakfast with lots of yogurt the next day

This was delicious, a big hit with everyone in the family.  Served with vanilla ice cream on top.  I used a little extra fruit (almost 4  3/4 c. instead of 4), but it was perfect.  We had a bunch of fresh cherries from a friend's tree that weren't very sweet.  I used a little less sugar then called for, and the topping was wonderful.

I did line the pan with foil, with made clean up much easier.

I only wish I owned a cherry pitter, I now have stained fingers!

What a complete waste of 4 cups of fresh picked cherries! Way, way, way too much sugar, you barely taste the sour cherries at all, just sugar. Every spoonful is 80% fatty-sugary-crisp, if you're lucky you get a cherry with all that carrier. This should be all about the cherries, but it's not.

Wonderfully delicious! I made this with our 1st cherry harvest of the year. I was concerned that the early harvest may make it slightly sour. No way! Oh, this was SO good, exactly as instructions were written. Def being added to my ‘favorites’.

Absolutely loved this.  Had some tart cherries in the freezer.  As some of the other reviewers suggested, I didn't use as much sugar mixed in with the cherries and I did add the layer of cream cheese.  Hubby said "Don't lose that recipe!"   5-1-19  Made this again using a 3 lb bag of mixed berries.  Just as delicious as with cherries!

I made this with fresh sweet cherries, and it was delicious!  Since the cherries were sweet, I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup.  I also threw in a handful of blueberries since I had them on hand.  I took it to a friend who is having medical problems, and her family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

As written, this recipe is sickeningly sweet and fatty. No fruit flavor came through. No "crispy" topping, just a sticky goop of syrup with some oats embedded in it. I usually make smaller batches of fruit crisps, so I overrode my misgivings about the sugar and fat amounts. What a mistake!

Because my husband is diabetic, I substituted xylitol for the granulated sugar and added a very little bit of Splenda.  He loved it, and so did his son. Before the first one was done, he asked for another one, and it's in the oven now . . . but this time I added some extra cherries  and some blueberries (because I need to use them). Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used honey instead of white sugar and the fruit set up well under the crisp.  I also used an extra cup of cherries and that didn't hurt the results one bit!

Made it as recipe states. Great flavor--cherries were tangy but not sour--just the right amount of sugar. I would add more cherries next time as they cook down quite a bit and the ratio of cherries to topping was a little unbalanced. Maybe use 6 cups of cherries and up the white sugar accordingly. Otherwise, really good.

I took heed of all the suggestions, and adapted this by decreasing the sugar in the cherries.  I used canned cherries, and nowhere could I find ideas on whether or not to drain the cherries, so I drained 1 can, and left the liquid in the other two. I used 3 cans of tart cherries, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 5 TBSP flour in the cherries, and it was just about right. I made the crumble topping without the shortening, and cut the cold butter in after mixing the rest well.  I found I had a little extra topping and froze it for individual peach crumbles later this week.  The great  tartness of the cherries and the sweetness of the topping was a huge success with my family. 

Thanks for this recipe!  (I rated it five stars based on eliminating the shortening and half the sugar, not the original as-written recipe.)

I made this recipe near exact to the ingredients except I added 1 tsp almond extract to crumble and only used butter, no shortening. I had read a lot of reviews saying that the recipe had too much crumble on top. I cannot imagine that's possible so followed the recipe exact. As suspected, definitely not too much crumble. Approved by my eight year old and sure to be a family favorite with the cherry tree in the backyard :-).

This is a great recipe . Simple and easy to double if feeding a big crowd... or feeding a small crowd that likes seconds and thirds ! I used all butter in the topping ... not sure what the reasoning was to use shortening and butter in the topping . I love love love cherries , and actually used about two extra cups of cherries and added another Tablespoon of flour.  I love the amount of topping when using the 9x13 baking dish . I don't find it too much . I love topping and even on it's own taste great oreith a little spoon up of vanilla ice cream. This is just a great comfort dessert or snack on a nice summers night sitting with family on the deck .

First time I made cherry crisp from scratch. Husband did not like batch of fresh cherries I bought and did not want to waste them. Turned out great! This is a keeper.

The cherry component of this cobbler has way too much sugar in it. The cherries were delicious but I could literally feel the sugar on my tongue when I ate the syrup. I gave this 3 stars because the oatmeal topping was delicious.

Real good.  Would have been better with sour cherries like it calls for. I used regular fresh cherries, pitted them (gotta get a pitter tool...my lifesaver!).  Tossed cherries with the sugar and a little lemon juice, then refrigerated for a few hours first.  My husband loved it!!!

The amount of shortening and butter didn't work for this dish. Even after I tried to cut the shortening into the oats I knew it didn't look right. The oatmeal topping sunk to the bottom during baking and the cherries were swimming in the grease!  The proportions should be re evacuated. This was tasty, though.

Very good!  Just a few modifications.  With the cherries, I cut the sugar to one cup. Also for the topping, I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I used all butter.  It seemed like too much topping and only ended up using about 2/3 of it and baked it up in a 9 x 9 pan.

This was a great starter recipe for me, I made this exactly as written except the shortening - I used butter instead. I found that it was a little too sweet for my taste so I will simply use less sugar next time. Overall, I thought it suited my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

The first thing I am going to say is that making this makes your house smell AMAZING!!!! I just picked sour cherries yesterday so I used those. When I was adding the sugar and flour to the cherries I noticed it was really dry, so I added some of the cherry juice to the mixture. I baked one in a 9x13 and one in a 11x7. The 11x7 took 40 minutes in my oven and the 9x13 took 55 minutes. I read some comments saying that there is too much topping, so I left about a cup and a half out to make a blueberry crisp to freeze. Doing so I had a perfect amount of topping for both. Overall this recipe is amazing and tastes wonderful! ( I had to sneak a couple bites :) I plan om warming it up before eating and serving it with vanilla ice cream. Found my new cherry crisp recipe!!

Took a tip from another reviewer and (depending on the fruit I use) cut the topping in half.  I have made it with the full topping amount, but for my family it is a bit too much.  I've made this crisp with fresh cherries, frozen cherries, apples of all varieties, mixed berries, and peaches.  Never fails!

*edit for Sept 2019* Still making my crisps with this recipe!  Still (usually) cutting the topping amount in half.  If there was ever a problem with the final product, it was from my own error.  This recipe has honestly never failed me!

Love this recipe. I used just enough of the syrup from the tart cherries to cover them in the baking dish. I also added one tablespoon of corn starch to help thicken the sauce and one teaspoon of almond extract for a little surprise flavor. This is a keeper!

Update to my review:
I've made this recipe several times now and have come up with the following modifications:
I add 4 tablespoons of cherry juice, 1 teas of almond exract and 1 tablespoon corn starch to the cherry mixture. I increase the oats in the topping by 1/2 cup and add 1 teas of cinnamon, 1/2 teas nutmeg and 1/4 teas cloves.
I love the extra crunch in the topping with the extra oats and the spices give it some extra flavor and zip. The almond in the cherry mix is awesome. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Very yummy & easy sour cherry crisp! I made 2 batches both with frozen sour cherries. I made 1 batch as the recipe is written (substituting butter for the shortening) & made the 2nd batch substituting tapioca flour for the all purpose flour & gluten-free oats for the regular oats to make a gluten-free dessert (again substituting butter for the shortening). Both turned out wonderfully! Make sure to let the crisp sit once it comes out of the oven so that it can set up.

I made it per the recipe for my wife and two boys and it was gone in an hour! Add some vanilla ice cream and we're talking divine. I liked it so much I'm trying the recipe again, but this time with apples. I hope it's as good as with the cherries!

ok.  For starters there are too few cherries for the size of pan.  I put four cups into an 8x8 pan and added cinnamon,nutmeg and almond flavoring, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Not sure about the flour.  Next time I'd try tapioca.  The crisp I cut by 1/2, the sugar by more than 1/2 and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  Some sliced almonds would be a nice touch as well.

Super easy to make.  While I didn't personally taste this, I sent it to my husband's work and he said it was amazing.  His office devoured it in record time.  I will make this again next year at cherry season.

Just finished a bowl of this and it was wonderful! My father in law is already on seconds. Served with whipped cream and it was the perfect way to end a meal.

I used canned dark sweet cherries, which came out way too sweet with this recipe.  The crust tastes awesome, especially when warm!  My only other complaint is there was way too much crust.

Good, easy, straightforward recipe.  I tend to leave out the flour since I don't do carbs very well, and definitely left out shortening.  I used less butter as well.  I didn't have quite enough cherries, so I added some frozen mango I found in the freezer, and some dried cranberries.  I subbed Splenda Brown Sugar for the regular brown sugar.  Its baking now, and smells fantastic! It will be very welcome in this extended snowy weather.

Very Tasty! I had presweetened canned cherries that I wanted to use up so I didn't  add the sugar or flour to the cherries. This recipe is easily modified  if you don't have fresh fruit on hand. The cherries bubble up under the gorgeous golden crisp. Topped off with vanilla ice cream this is a true crowd pleaser. I'm just kicking myself for not taking a picture. It looks that good. This recipe is a keeper!

I substituted the butter for the shortening because I was out, but it was delicious!  Lots of crumbly topping, which we love!

Looked all over for cherries and couldn't fine the sour kind, so we totally changed this up with a bag of frozen triple berries (blueberry, raspberry and blackberry), following the recipe exactly  otherwise, it turned out GREAT!

Excellent when skipping the shortening and using fresh cherries!  I also used more cherries than the recipe called for to make it extra good.

I was a bit disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh SWEET cherries.  All I could taste was brown sugar with every bite.  My husband thinks it would have been good if I had used sour cherries.  Next time I will decrease the sugar as suggested and add more oats to make it crunchier and of course, use sour cherries.

Very good, but I wish I had made more topping and increased the amount of oats used. Like other reviewers suggested, I cut the shortening, and I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup because I used dark sweet cherries (frozen). I added a little cinnamon to the topping.  Hope to make it with sour cherries soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome.  It's quick to make and tastes awesome.  I didn't have any butter so I substituted 1/4 cup butter margarine and used shortening for the rest.  I did add about 1 extra cup of oats to make the top more crumbly.  Also, at a higher altitude you only need to bake it for about 25 minutes.

Great recipe.  I used sour cherries from my tree and there wasn't too much sugar for them.  The only change I made was to leave out the shortening and to add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping mixture.  We've had it twice already and loved it.  Great topped with milk, ice cream, or whipped cream.

This was wholly b-jolly sickly sweet!  I'm not sure where to start to make it right for us.  I'm still trying to figure out how to tone it down so that we can enjoy this one.  Waaaaay too much sugar or something, and I did use tart cherries.

I used regular sweet cherries, and it did not come out having the tartness I was expecting (hard to find sour cherries in Fairbanks, Alaska in the winter. The topping also wasn't as crunchy as I was hoping.

great!  Added a bit of oinnamon, used only butter and cut it to 1 1/2 cups.  I used sweet cherries so I only used 1 cup sugar and probably would cut it to 3/4cup next time

Yum!  Used frozen pie cherries and will probably still cut back on the sugar next time.  I made the topping ahead of time and it keeps well because of the shortening instead of butter.

A delicious, very easy recipe for using fresh cherries from the garden! Very easy for my young granddaughter to prepare.
