OMG!  I think I have died and gone to heaven eating this fantastic praline bread pudding!  It is awesome!  And it tastes great either hot or cold.  It was so easy to make.  I halved the recipe and otherwise followed the recipe except I used walnuts instead of pecans just because that is what I had on hand.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.

This is VERY sweet -- especially if you're going to add a sweet sauce to top it off.  I wish I had followed my instincts and cut the sugar down to 2 cups.  I would also mix all the ingredients together before pouring them into the bread -- otherwise you're likely to break down the bread completely .-- so you get mush.  I like the crusts also because that helps to keep it from compacting down too much -- just make sure to soak bread long enough to absorb the liquids.

I made this recipe for our Christmas dinner.  My family ate every crumb!  I am rating this recipe AS WRITTEN.  I didn't change a thing.  This is my first time trying to make bread pudding and it came out great.  Thank you for sharing! I have been told I will be making this at every family gathering from now on :)

Absolutely amazing. Use whatever bread you have- French, boule etc. I cut some of the harder top off - but would be fine to leave crust on. Make sure you toast pecans. I made ahead and stored in frig until my dinner party. I think key is to cook in rectangular pan as recommended- and don't overcook. I served with fresh whipped cream with vanilla extract mixed in AND ice cream on other side.  I wish I had saved some pecans to garnish the top- or pan caramelized pecans for the top.  Maybe that would have been too over the top- lol. Major hit of a dinner party. I think would easily serve 8-12 people+. I wish I had taken a photo!  Ps- I plumped the raisins in a tablespoon of hot water with vanilla extract- zapped in microwave on very low a minute.

Without a doubt the best bread pudding I have ever made.  I did use a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin bread ( exactly 1 pound ) to save a little time.  The sauce was perfect.  I give this 5 stars.

I had been looking for a Banana Bread Pudding recipe and made a couple of alterations to this recipe.  I reduced the vanilla extract to 2 tsps and added 2 tsps of banana extract.  Instread of raisins I added to 2 cups of sliced banana which I had tossed with a little lemon juice.  It worked out perfect.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  Made this for a Valentine's Day supper as my husband is a Southern boy.  The best bread pudding I have ever  eaten.  This recipe puts ALL of the restaurant bread puddings I have had to shame.  When you combine this recipe with love it's unbeatable.
Thank you for sharing this treasure of a recipe.

This without a doubt is the best bread pudding I have ever had. I used a loaf of wheat french bread as well as omitting one cup of the milk and adding heavy cream. Makes it just a little richer as well as a better match for the pecans.

Phenomenal exactly as written. I didn't change a thing. We ate it warm the night I baked it, and cold the following night. Both were absolutely delicious. Thank you for a solid recipe that is easy and scrumptous!

OMG this is killer.  I had never made bread pudding before but this was easy.  I used golden raisins (soaked in hot water to plump) and added 1/4 cup more to recipe.  I also took a little butter in my frying pan and sautéed the pecans prior to making the sauce.  My husband loved this and I took half to the hospital where I volunteer and everyone said it was the best bread pudding they ever had.  Will make again only next time I will add a few more pecans to sauce and cut sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and add a little more cinnamon and vanilla. Either way this is a perfect dish to impress people.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe. Use a very big mixing bowl. In addition to cinnamon i added 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon allspice, and 1 teaspoon nutmeg. I had a small bad of praline pecans that i rough chopped and added to sauce. All said and done this is one awesome recipe! Even better after it sits and settles!

Unbelievably great....I cut back on the sugar a little bit (2 cups instead of 3) because my husband doesn't like anything too sweet. Hands down great recipe!!!!!!

Rich, rich, rich, but oh soooo good!  This was the first time I made bread pudding and was able to use up old stale odds and ends of different kinds of bread left in my refrigerator in this (waste not want not).  I also cut back to 2 cups of sugar instead of 3.  The sauce was an added bonus!

My husband's a bread pudding critic and freak.   He likes it rich and thick, not mushy and eggy.  This is it.

I tore the pieces  "some small, some medium."  
I used 2 and 3/4 cup of sugar, instead of the 3 suggested, and although delicious,  2 cups will be fine next time.  The texture was perfect and the praline sauce fantastic.  

I decided not to pour the praline sauce over the pan ,but over individual servings instead.  YUM!

This is the first time to make bread pudding.  I'm not sure if it was I just don't like bread pudding or I didn't follow the recipe correctly but I didn't like final product.  It reminded me of mashed up french toast.  LOL.  Lets just say, I still have 3/4 of a dish left...no one in the house really cared for it.  BUT it could just be we aren't bread pudding fans.

EXCELLENT,  SOO SWEET,  EASY. I read reviews and followed with success. I did not use full 1/4 cup of butter in pan, I also only used 2 cups of sugar. I also combined eggs and few other
following ingredients together then mixed in bread at once.
I used all bread ,crusts included. Turned out just fine. Sauce very good and sweet . Toasted pecans . Be attentive to sauce.
Stir. I served with whip cream. I think it was important to help cut sweetness. Also few blueberries on plate. Many positive comments all loved.

10 STARS for the sauce!  Just like the pralines from Aunt Sally's in New Orleans.  You can make a dessert out of the sauce itself.  Serve it over ice cream or on your finger, its heavenly either way. Don't forget to toast the pecans (and watch them carefully so you don't burn them).  I use THIS sauce on the Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce III recipe. It's just like grandma used to make!

It was good. However, if I make it again, I will put just a little salt in the pudding. It's way sweet. Plus, the sauce recipe calls for 1/2 pound of butter. That's two sticks. That is too much butter. I boiled it a couple of times and simmered it for about 20 minutes. Sauce never did get thickned up.

Simply divine!  So easy, so aromatic.  Made this using challah bread.  Followed others' advice and reduced sugar to 2 cups (could easily cut it to 1 and would be fine with a sweet bread).  Would also recommend all 1/2 and 1/2 for a richer texture/taste.  Didn't presoak raisins because they cook up plump in the egg/milk.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Pretty good. I think it was a little too much butter in the sauce. The taste was much better the next day.

Awesome bread pudding!  I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar for the bread, I also mixed all of those ingredients together and poured over the bread at once, and then stirred the bread mixture occasionally until all liquid was absorbed.  Other than cutting down on the sugar in that mix, the only other change that I made was to add 2 tablespoons of spiced rum to the sauce mixture while it was boiling.  My entire family raved about it.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2018 and everybody loved it.  There was none left.   I did use only half the sugar listed in the pudding and praline sauce because we have diabetics in the family but it still came out delicious and sweet.  Top it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  Oh my!!

I used a little less sugar in the pudding.  I also mixed the eggs, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla together before I mixed with soaked bread.  Everyone loved this dessert.  The praline sauce is very good.

Wow, my first time making bread pudding...and what a great recipe! I halved the recipe and ended up cooking it for about 10 minutes longer than stated to get the bread slightly brown on top. Next time I may try to use day old French bread instead. That topping is very simple and absolutely makes the finished result fabulous. Thanks for sharing

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!  Have made this three times now.  Made it the first time with croissants second time with left over yeast rolls (home made) and tonight with regular white bread.  Made with half the sugar each time.  First two were delicious!!  Thinking, with this pecan sauce you could probably make the pudding with cardboard and it would still be good.  LOL  Anyway, we'll see how tonight goes.  The house is smelling yummmy.

This bread pudding was the best I have ever made. The only change I made was to add dried cranberries with the raisins since I didnt have enough raisins. My husband and guest loved it.  Great recipe, easy and fast to make.

Made this with my mother ("mature" :-) excellent cook) watching over me.  She didn’t think it would be done in 50 minutes and she was right. I had it in for 65 minutes and when I scooped the corner out, liquid rushed out of the center. It’s back in the oven *sad face*. Odd thing is that the inside oven temp read 325 so I’m perplexed why it was still liquid. Anyway, I used Hawaiian sweet rolls and 1 1/2 cups of sugar and the corner piece I scooped out was much too sweet, and I’m the gal that could eat cotton candy all day, so I like sweet stuff. If you’re using sweet bread I wouldn’t use more than 1 cup sugar.  Hopefully this will eventually thicken up and maybe it’ll be better with some homemade unsweetened whipped cream to cut the sweetness.

I just used some stale bread in the cabinet and I mix the wet ingredients and pour over the bread chunks rather than stir, because I prefer that consistency, but the recipe is great and THAT SAUCE! YUM!

This is amazing!  We serve this in our restaurant and get RAVE reviews.  Remove the sauce and it's a great base recipe for other flavors too.  I add rhubarb and serve with heavy cream.

I made only one change- I cut the sugar in half. I used 1.5 cups of sugar and the loaf of French bread I bought was only 12 ounces but I followed everything else exactly. It came out perfect! It was delicious! Everyone raved about it. The sauce is delicious and easy to make. I probably could have made less than what the recipe called for as I had a lot left over. I'd also recommend poking holes in the bread pudding to get the sauce to soak in a little more. Really good! I'm glad I didn't do 3 cups of sugar though, I feel like it would've been way to sweet with the sauce.

I made this with challah bread in a slow cooker and called it Deconstructed French Toast.   We have Slow Cooker Sunday at my job, I brought this in with some turkey sausage and they've been asking for it ever since.  This is my Sunday and I'll be bringing this in again.   It's DELICIOUS!

Took this to a dinner party where it received rave reviews and several requests for the recipe.  One person thought it was a "secret" family recipe.  I used 2-1/2 cups sugar followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I did have to bake it considerably longer than 50 minutes.

OMGoodness!  I've made bread pudding before, but not with this sauce.  Took it to work for a Fat Tuesday celebration.  I did, however, mix all my ingredients and added them all at once to the bread, then let it soak for the 10 mins.  Distributes them more evenly and kept the texture I like as there is not as much stirring of the soggy bread. Also reduced the sugar to 2 cups. The sauce, especially, was fantastic!

A good old bread pud, but far too sweet.  I didn't use bread, but stale brioche.  Also I don't see the need to put everything one by one.  I mixed it all together and left it for 30 mins to soak well.  I dislike dried fruit cooked, so used some cherries and raspberries.  The praline sauce was a delicious addition.  Note.  One usually makes bread pud with stale bread.  It used to be the dessert of the poor and was taken down to the baker for him to cook with the bread.

I made this just like the recipe called for & it was awesome!! I made it for a Bunco party.  I did a Cajun themed lunch & it was the hit of the lunch.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My mom used to make bread pudding for us when we were little & it was always good.  It was the first time I made it & my husband wants to know if I'm going to make it for just him.  LOL

Delicious! I have tried several bread pudding recipes before and could not find one that was perfect. This one is sensational! Family and friends could not get enough! Next time I think I will try to add a little bourbon to the sauce.

As most people have mentioned on this recipe, I used less sugar by 2/3 cup, but think I’ll cut it down to 2 cups next time. I was in a hurry, so I just mixed my liquids and sugar and cinnamon all together and poured it on the bread. (I didn’t even measure!) It baked up beautifully. When making the sauce, I kept cooking and stirring and it didn’t seem to thicken. We were running late for our church small group, so I just poured ITV not s container to transport and went on our way. I have to say, the praline sauce is to die for. When I tasted it at church it was fantastic and everyone loved it! Had to tell them I just followed the Allrecipes.com recipe I found. The next day I warmed some up after dinner and it was still just as delicious as when it was fresh. This is saved to my favorites for next time!

OMGoodness, Yum! I wasn't sure if the sauce was supposed to be poured over the whole dish before serving or if it was to be served on the side. I chose to serve it on the side as it would likely have made the pudding too soggy for my tastes. That said, if the sauce is to be served separately, don't boil the cream mixture as it gets a curdled appearance. Next time I will try using only 2 cups of sugar in the bread.

This is an absolutely FANTASTIC recipe!!  DING DING!  We have a winner!  I used 2 & 2/3 c. heavy cream & 1 & 1/3 c. 2% milk in pudding mixture.  I decreased the white sugar to 2 & 1/2c.  (2c would have probably been fine too).  I added 1tsp salt to the pudding & 1/2 tsp salt to the praline sauce. 
The cream & milk ratio was because I had a lot of cream!  I added  the salt because I like the sweet/salty combo.  It came out perfect. ??

I doubled this recipe but cut back on the sugar as other's suggested, using 3 cups. I also let my French bread pieces sit out until they got stale before mixing with the milk. It was out of this world! I will definitely make this again!

Found the bread pudding was a little bit watery and took considerably longer to cook.     But the taste is to die for!    Would make it again but would add more pecans into the sauce and more bread into the mixture.

Very sweet, so for me I could use less sugar, but my husband will love it! I used a darker bread (what I had leftover) and used part whit and part brown sugar in the pudding (again, What I had left after Thanksgiving cooking). I’d make it again. Yum!

The bread pudding is delicious.  As others have suggested, I cut back on the sugar to 2-1/2 c.  I added about 1/2 c. golden raisins, so that added sweetness too, and in the future I would cut it back to 2 c. sugar.  

I didn't have enough butter to make the praline sauce, and I wonder if it would have been gilding the lily, although I'm sure it would have been delicious.

It took more like an hour and 20 minutes to bake it completely.

This is so stinkin' good. Practically perfect in every way. Have made many times, always by the recipe, and love it every time. We use challah bread, but have used regular bread, cinnamon raisin bread and probably others. Prefer challah, but that's personal taste.

My husband made it for a potluck,  It was a big hit!  It is very rich and decadent.  He added abut a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and substituted glazed pecans (since we had some at home already) for the toasted pecans.

Personal preference: I use 4 eggs, half the sugar for the bread pudding (the sauce is very sweet), mix the wet ingredients & then pour it over the bread. 2nd time I made it I used egg whites (had a carton that needed using) subbed 1/2 the milk with almond milk (had a carton that needed using), used turbinado sugar (out of white sugar). Couldn't even tell I had subbed anything. The sauce is what makes this SO Delicious! I do make sure the sugar is dissolved before pouring it on the bread, and then I let it sit 30 min for good absorption.

Consider these changes:
1.  Cut the recipe raisins, cinnamon, and bread, instead use a loaf of your favorite raisin bread;
2.  Cut sugar in half;
3. Put all bread pieces in a buttered 9 x 13.  (I Like to dry out my bread first in a very low oven before breaking it into pieces-about 6 to eight pieces per slice, not too small);
4.  Mix all the liquified ingredients together into a pudding type mixture and carefully pour all over the bread pieces. Use a flat spatula to gently lift the bread pieces to allow liquid to reach the bottom of the pan, so that the bread soaks all the liquid up evenly.  Let the entire soak an hour or even overnight.
5.  And Most importantly,  Do Not Stir!!   Stirring makes it Tough!  

This makes the consistency much nicer!  
Bake as directed and make the praline sauce for serving!    
Knocks their socks off!

It was absolutely delicious...I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the praline sauce for added flavor and used walnuts instead of pecans...a major in a family that never really liked bread pudding - now it's specifically requested....

Soooo good!!! I made some changes. Some accidentally some on purpose. I was rushing and accidentally poured the 1/4 cup melted butter in the custard mix instead of using it to coat the dish.(I used the other half stick of butter and just rubbed the pan generously before I added the mix. Also, because it is what I had on hand, I used heavy cream instead of half and half, a whole loaf of store bought sliced wheat bread, toasting each slice before tearing it up. I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 based on other reviewers. OMG... so creamy and rich but not overly sweet. I would absolutely make again, with all of my changes of course. Sometimes accidents are meant to be.

Fanfreakintastic after I changed it a little. I used salted butter to grease the pan. I only used 2 cups of sugar on the advice of other reviewers.  I used the one pound loaf of Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread plus 2 more pieces of wheat bread sliced into small cubes. For the sauce,  I agreed with another reviewer that 1/2 pound of butter is too much. I used 1 stick  plus 2 T. I didn't use heavy cream,  just regular.  This was probably a mistake.  The sauce wasn't very thick. I had added 1 T of whiskey while it was boiling.  It was just too sweet. I served it with vanilla ice cream and sauce on top.  My mom and I decided it is the BEST EVER!!!

Sooo good and very easy! Have made it about 4 times now, and even tripled the recipe to serve at the VFW where I cook. Everyone loved it! I made homemade whipped cream to top it ,but the heat of pudding melts the whipped cream down too fast for me. So am going to try some vanilla ice cream on the next batch and serve it slightly warm instead of very warm. The praline sauce is deliciously rich, so a little goes a long way. This bread pudding also freezes well. Wrap serving size pieces in saran wrap and pop in freezer. Didn't last very long, it was calling my name very time I walked into kitchen! LOL!

Excellent and easy!  I halved it and it was perfect for my needs.  I did add pecans along with raisins and had then on top also.  Delicious.  I did not think it too sweet as some others have.  Will make this my go-to recipe for BP.

Excellent!  I used Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup added 1 extra egg.  Also combined heavy cream with unsweetened coconut milk.  Kept the topping as stated.
So decadent ~ a true comfort food!

This bread pudding recipe he gets no stars.  However the sauce was very good I even scraped it all off for ice cream topping. It was heavy and had no flavor at all. I'm slowly but surely learning I can't trust this site for good recipes you're better off going to professional cooks

I don't remember if I commented on this recipe before but I sure am now! This is amazing bread pudding! I did do an adjustment. I added 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. It gave it a wonderful flavor. I also added 1 tsp of butter flavor. I will only make this recipe now. It's wonderful! Oh, and no sauce needed. A must pass along recipe!!!

Fantastic! Everyone loved it! I substituted whole wheat buns and cinnamon raisin bread (that is what I had on hand) and it was still fabulous! I also added ripe bananas. I mixed all ingredients except the bread chunks  in one bowl and then just poured the wet ingredients over the bread chunks in the pan. It was so good! The praline sauce put it over the top! Yum! Will definitely make this again and again!

This was my 1st every attempt at making bread pudding and it was a home run!!!  I used leftover dinner rolls that I had, and cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups.  The sauce makes A LOT, so I may cut it in half next time.  Absolutely the best bread pudding I've ever had!!!

This is the BEST dessert I've ever made/eaten!  I brought this to my church and even with 3 cups of sugar me nor the ladies that tried this said it was too sweet.  I ate 3 pieces the first time and had to stop myself from going back for a forth.  I will be making this for family occasions.  I may need to double the recipe!  It's wonderful !!

Pudding turned out good but the amount of butter needed for topping was too much. I had to add extra ingredients to cut the butter taste.

Fabulous bread pudding.  Second time I made it, I cut the sugar back to 2 cups and it was extremely sweet.  I may try it once again and will cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  The praline sauce never thickened for me and in light of the 2 sticks of butter and all that heavy cream, I think next time I might skip the sauce and just blob the top with some whipped cream.  I would like to add that I'm no stranger to sugar.  It is my downfall in life so for a sugar-holic to say something is too sweet, it certainly must be so, but still, it is very delicious! Thanks for sharing.

This was a great dish. I cut the white sugar to 2 cups. I wish I had cut the sugar in the topping too.  I would suggest toasting your pecans on top the stove while letting the bread soak up the milk. My husband loved it!

Flavor was great,  yet way too runny. I used stale brioche bread and followed recipe to a t.  Will cut back on milk next time; still a keeper.

Very good and tastey recipe. The only change I would and will make the next time is on the praline sauce. The recipe for the sauce makes, in my opinion way too much, very good but too much. I'd suggest either halving or even quartering the sauce recipe. As the pudding is good on it's own but in a 9 x 13 inch pan the amount of sauce overwhelms the bread pudding.
I love my sweets but as you can see by the recipe 
there's alot of sugar.
I'll make it again with the changes noted above.

I liked this recipe as long as you MODIFY the recipe. I did read the reviews ahead of time before making this. I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, pepperidge farm brand of raisin & cinnamon bread, and only 1/4 pound of butter (less butter). Also, the bake time is more like 60 minutes so it won't be mush. The praline sauce is delicious ! With a little more thought, this is a great tasting bread pudding recipe ! :)

Amazing! I love bread pudding and have been searching for a great recipe. This is it! I made it exactly as the recipe is listed except for I only used 2 cups of white sugar instead of 3. With the sauce it was the perfect sweetness for my family! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Made with one cup Stevia,(pretending to be good) one cup white sugar and one cup light brown sugar. Quite good, sweet, with a soft texture. I've had bread puddings that were not as soft as this one turns out - Matter of taste. The caramel pecan sauce would make cardboard your favorite desert. Guests loved it, one of them took a big container home. None went to waste!

Yes, to the one reviewer, you have to be a bread pudding lover to enjoy bread pudding! Some just don’t like this old fashioned dish. But WE do, and my husband of 44 years is still eating his second dish as I write this!  Only change was to reduce the sugar in the pudding. The divine praline sauce is sweetness enough!  This is easy, pretty, and GOOD!

I've long adored bread pudding and this is among the best I've made.  I followed the advice and cut back on the sugar.  Added some Tennessee whisky to the sauce, to the delight of all.  I had trouble getting my share of the leftovers -- my picky daughter got there first.

This is one of best recipes for bread pudding that I've tried. I did reduce from 3 to 2 cups of sugar because with the praline topping and vanilla ice cream it provided enough sweetness.

This is a great recipe. I did take the suggestions to cut the sugar to 2 cups and mix the first 8 ingredients together, then soak the bread. I'll definitely make this again. Easy and delicious!

Not sure what I did wrong but the pudding never solidified even after almost 2 hours of cooking and raising the temp to 350 degrees after the first hour.  Basically it was a pan full of sweet mush.   I followed the recipie precisely except for cutting back the sugar to 2 cups.

Halved this recipe and used an 8x8 pan. Turned out perfect. I personally found it a little too sweet, but the hubs loved it, and he is the bread pudding expert. Next time I would add a little more raisins (personal preference...we love raisins) and cut the sugar in the actual bread pudding mixture by 1/3. With the caramel topping, you’ll never miss it in the pudding. Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe! I change it up by adding blueberries, peaches or any fresh fruit you desire.  I also add white choc chips depending on my mood (when you reheat leftovers the chips melt creating a sauce)! I like to add a bit of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to the milk mixture, it gives the custard a delicious flavor. Fresh whipping cream or ice cream at service puts this dessert over the top! I've also prepared the mixture then baked it in greased or lined large muffin pans. They make for great individual portions or on the go breakfast if you dare!!

I agree with the review by Poirot and wish I had read it fully before starting. I cut back to 2 cups sugar (could probably go lower) and wish I had combined the eggs, vanilla, sugar, etc. before adding them to the bread/half & half mixture.  This would have resulted in a better texture.
I love the praline sauce! I made half of the recipe and it will probably be enough (we haven’t finished the pan yet).

This was one of the best bread puddings that I have ever made. I used two 1/2 loves of bread that were slightly stale instead of using fresh French bread and I reduced the white sugar by one cup. I am not a big fan of pecans, next time I will make it with walnuts instead. Very good recipe!!

This is amazing comfort food.  I followed recommendations of some of the others such as using the Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread.  I cut back the sugar from 3 to 2 cups, but otherwise as written except mixed all liquids together before adding the bread to soak.  Praline sauce is amazing!!  I can think of several possibilities for that on its own. We ate hot and cold and took to our Sunday school class..... this is a keeper!!! Huge success and really very easy to make.

Oh my goodness!  This is fantastic!!  I made it as stated except I only used 2 cups white sugar (instead of 3) because I don't like things super sweet.  I'm glad I did that because, with the sauce, it is still sweet but PERFECT!! I poured the sauce on top as soon as I removed the pudding from the oven.  We ate some immediately.  I was amazed at how delicious it was. Wow! This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Leah Little,  for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I made this for my wife for Valentine's Day. I have never made bread pudding before. I followed the recipe as written with the exception I used a loaf of my own home made 3 day old bread and I added vanilla to the sauce. Big hit made my baby smile. I will make this again. It is rich tho. I also served it with a small scoop of Vanilla Haagen Dazs. Delicious!!

Excellent, delicious bread pudding.  Mixing the milk, cream, and eggs together worked fine.  I served the warm praline sauce on the side so everyone could use as much or little as they wanted. Everyone LOVED it!   I had some sauce left over, SO....treated myself a couple of days later to a quartered biscuit (canned) baked in it to make an amazing mini "monkey bread" treat! I may make a small amount of the sauce sometime to keep in the fridge just for that!

My grandmother made bread pudding when I was young  and I loved it. However hers can't compare to this. I went to some fancy restaurant  once where they served a bread pudding with praline sauce and it was the best. This one is better then the best it is a dish of heaven in you dinning room. I would not change a thing and serve it often.

This was my first bread pudding try, and I do not think I need to look any further. I added way more raisins by which I mean 1 1/2 cups and I did not add the nuts. The sauce really pulls together this dish but I find it is a little much, so I half the amount. 
I made this for a get together and was banned from every bring it again after one person ate, literally, half the pan.

I made this for Easter upon the request from a friend for bread pudding.  I cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups and mixed the pudding ingredients the night before and refrigerated.  It got rave reviews!  I will use this recipe again!

This one is a keeper. I made it and it's pretty good but I had to use 2cups of sugar instead of  3.

Made this for a work Thanksgiving luncheon. Was told it's better than the famous Houston restaurants that serve bread pudding. I did reduce the sugar by 3/4 of a cup since the sauce is pretty sweet but wit would be good with the full amount if you like particularly sweet desserts. Great the day of and the next day. Sauce is good over vanilla bean ice cream if you serve that on the side as well!

Super sweet and took longer to cook, but the sauce makes it!
