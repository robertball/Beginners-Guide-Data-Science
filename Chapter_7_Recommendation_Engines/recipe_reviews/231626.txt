I love broccoli salad but have never had it with Mozzarella cheese, gives a nice mild creaminess to the salad. I used part skim Moz. and an 8oz. chunk shredded yielded about a cup and half of cheese. I had two heads of broccoli, so not sure if that was a pound or not. The dressing was pretty good and not as vinegary as other dressings tend to be, I just added the sugar until it reached my sweet preference, just a bit under the amount called for, and I added in a few grinds of black pepper. I've learned over the years when you make a broccoli salad, make it several hours before serving so the broccoli has time to absorb the dressing, the longer the better, if you want crispy bacon just wait and toss it in later. This salad is good enough for company and will be in my recipe box.

I omitted the sugar and instead used one packet of Truvia. I did add a few spices to the dressing to jazz it up a bit (dill weed, dried chives, onion/garlic powder, celery salt, little hot sauce, fresh ground pepper). Very nice broccoli salad. The longer it sits, the better it gets.

I am sorry I ever found this recipe.

The first time I made it, I took it to work for a pot luck.  Now this is all they ever want me to bring.

So much for taking a bag of chips or some buns.  That will never happen again.

My bowl is almost always the only one that's empty, and I at least double the recipe.

Excellent!!! I have made this several times for parties and have come home empty! No leftovers. Only thing I don't add is the onions I also have used fresh mozzarella cheese in the past but the shredded works great too! Great ANYTIME salad.

Best broccoli salad EVER!! I like to shred some of the broccoli and add to the mix as well. I've been making this at least once a week since I found this recipe.  My 2 year old LOVES it too!!!

This is just what I needed in my life! Added tomatoes, small cubes of sharp cheddar cheese, and had a fork full of creamy goodness. Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe!  Sometimes I will add red globe grapes or Craisins for a little more color and a nice, surprising sweetness.

Great recipe, have made it a few times & it's always been a hit! I used aged cheddar instead of mozzarella because it's what I had in the fridge & it was still fantastic.

I could not find the recipe Tossed Broccoli Salad by Nina Pitcl.  I printed it years ago  and need a clean copy.  By doubling this recipe and substituting 1/2 lb of bacon, 1/2 of a red onion and cider vinegar I was able to replicate the recipe.

It is a wonderful dish. I think including dried cranberries and sunflower seeds would make it a bit more complete.
