1.20.20  I cooked the shrimp for 10 minutes, and they were overcooked.  Temperature at 450ºF definitely is high heat, so next time, I’ll start checking at 7 minutes.  It definitely does have a little kick to it, so keep that in mind when making the marinade.  We liked it, and I’d make again.

It was spicy yes but that's all. We couldn't taste the soy sauce or the honey; the olive oil over powered everything but the Cajun seasoning. I made it exact to the recipe but will not even try to doctor it up as there will be no next time. The most disappointing recipe I have ever found on this site.
