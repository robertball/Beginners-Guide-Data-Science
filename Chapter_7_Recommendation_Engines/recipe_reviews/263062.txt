Made as written and these turned out good. I was unable to find baharat so I Googled it and made my own. I really liked the texture these had with some of the salmon blended and some left in chunks. I also liked the fact that they held their shape well and did just fine in the oven instead of frying too. This is a keeper and one worth trying!

Deliciously different! I had to add extra bread crumbs as they were so soft. Used one whole egg and no roasted red pepper, as my husband doesn’t like them. Coated in panko bread crumbs and fried in olive oil.  The sauce is excellent too.

Amazing. Made it exactly how it said to and they were amazing. Went to share the recipe with my sister, knowing she would love it too, and added a bit extra parsley and peppers just for flare of appearance and it was still just as good.

I live in Alaska and cook salmon often, a lot of different ways. I have several favorite salmon cake recipes and this one is joining the list. I made my own baharat mix per an online recipe, which was very easy with common spices. I made the recipe pretty much as written, except I fried the cakes on an electric griddle vice broiling. Be sure to not overcook, as salmon is much better moist. I think the recommendation to cook to 160 is overly conservative. Don’t skip the aioli, it is fantastic!
