I never liked zucchini in anything until I tried this cake. It was moist, succulent, rich, and just downright decadent. I had two pieces of this right out of the oven and I could only finish part of them. After my brother lost his homecoming game last night in a miserable defeat, a slice of this phenomenal cake cheered him right up. This is a SPENDIFFEROUS recipe and I'm never trying another for zucchini cake again. Thanks for sharing Ani!

I wasn't sure how my husband would like this cake - not usually his kind of thing - but he LOVED it.  I was pleased with how moist it turned out and I loved the hint of orange flavor.  The only substitutions I made were: applesauce for 2/3 of the butter, and Splenda for 3/4 of the sugar - just to make it a bit lower in calories. This is a wonderful cake - thanks for the recipe!

This is the best zucchini cake I have ever had. I used 1/2 the sugar, added 1 cup of coconut. I meant to add some orange extract to the cake but forgot so I added it to the chocolate ganache I poured over this wonderful cake. Will make this again!!
*Update*
I had no butter so I used all applesauce and made sure I added orange extract in the cake and the icing!

Nice hint of orange. I used 1 cup of sugar with 3 Tbs orange juice for the glaze.
Easier glaze without having to cook it.

Extremely moist cake, and super easy to make.  I grated the zucchini very finely (as I don't like chuncks of vegetable in my desserts!) and I did press a good deal of the water out of the zucchini before folding it in to the batter (as some other comments mentioned that the recipe turned out really gooey) and it turned out wonderfully moist and soft, not gooey at all.  I will totally make this cake again; I'd also like to try it as a loaf for breakfast, with more nuts and some dried fruit, too.

Who could not just LOVE this chocolate cake!!  I found myself picking at it all weekend, so I had to freeze it so to avoid the temptation!  I served this as a desert at a BBQ and it was a great hit.  The non zucchini eaters were even fond of it!  I made some substitutions however:  1/2 cup pureed prunes to replace 1/2 cup of the butter, only used 3/4 of the requested amount of sugar and finally made less glaze with less sugar and less orange juice.  The only thing I would change for the next time is put more orange rind in the mixture!

Very good, with or without the glaze.  It is moist and holds up well for several days.  I used three packed cups of zucchini and a bit extra orange.

fantastic recipe.  the cake is really moist - even 4 days after i cooked it (alhtough people will eat it quickly).  no one cousl guess the 'secret ingrediant - zuchini and you can't even see it in the cake but it makes a great texture and moistness.  2 thumbs up.

Wonderfully rich, great with vanilla ice cream. I also made a chocolate ganache but used 3/4 cup cream with the zest of an orange, 9 oz. Semi sweet choc. chips & 1/4 cup orange juice. After bringing cream & zest to a boil, poured over choc. chips & stirred till smooth, then added the oj.

this is an excellent way to use up extra zucchinis. i only had 2eggs available, used o.j. instead of milk and substituted half a cup of plain yogurt, using only 1/4cup of butter. next time i will add more orange zest(just a personal preference). a very, very, good cake.

Made this last night for work - read all the reviews on here before doing so and made these modifications:  I used more orange zest (I used 2 tbsp), I wrung out the excess water in the zucchini, I used 1/4 C milk + 1/4 OJ instead of 1/2 C milk.  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used two different pans and each cake turned out perfectly (baked at 350F for 50 min exactly).  Thank you so much for this! People have already been asking for the recipe!  This one definitely is a keeper!  Can't wait to make it again.

I like zucchini bread, but I thought this was terrible. It overflowed my bundt pan while baking, then broke while I was taking out of the pan.  I won't make it again.

Very moist and very good. I baked it longer than suggested, maybe 10 minutes xtra. Seemed almost too much batter for the bundt pan at first, but in the end was fine. I will also try in a 9x13 pan. Was a bit hard to get out of the bundt pan. The icing added a nice touch to the cake, but does not look like the picture. Is more runny and goes on clear, not white like photo. I made recipe as is, minus the nuts but replaced with chocolate chips. Took this to a potluck and it was well received.

Very moist and very good. I took it to a family tea party and it was a hit. I had to cook it much longer than the recipe specified, about 20 minutes longer.

Mine turned out gooey, even though I cooked it for an extra 20 minutes. Next time I will drain the zucchini before adding it to the recipe.

This was a pretty cake, and good, but I thought it could be a little more chocolatey to make it more dessert-like and less like zucchini bread. I didn't care for the orange glaze that much - a chocolate one would be better. I made the recipe as written with the exception of using chocolate chips instead of walnuts. I also squeezed the liquid out of the zucchini first to keep it from getting to heavy.

Yummy!  Instead of orange zest, I used a tsp orange extract.  my 12 inch zuccine was 3 cups shredded.  I made this twice bec my kids requested it again.  Glaze it from the bottom so it can soak up the glaze juices then glaze the top.  It's a keeper.

This is an excellent cake - so tasty and moist.  One bit of warning though - it overflows in the rose shaped Bundt pan - make sure to use the regular size Bundt pan...  Will definately keep it in my favourites... Thank you AHUSIOW

This is the best way I have found to get rid of zucchini! I grated the zucchini with the small side of the grater - hard to tell its in there now. Also, I split into 2 bread pans and cooked for 45min at 350F due to lack of a bundt cake pan. The glaze is a glaze, not icing, so its OK if its thin. Spoon it on and let it soak in a bit.

This has to be the best chocolate cake ever - and the kids don't even realise that it is packed full of vegetables!  Everyone who tasted it could not believe how delicious it was.  I founf that this cake stores really well and is even better a few days after it is first bake (if it lasts that long!).

This was an amazing cake!!  Instead of using the orange juice glaze, I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and drizzled it over the cake.  I then sprinkled orange zest on the chocolate - Perfect!!

This is an extremely moist chocolate cake.  No one would ever suspect there is zucchini in it.  It is by far the best chocolate zucchini cake recipe that I've ever tried.  I would like there to be a little more orange flavor so the next time I'll add 1/2 cup of OJ instead of 1/2 cup of milk.

This was a very generous and yummy cake.  I made it to take to a meeting and it was a winner, with lots of comments and people asking for the recipe.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the baking soda, as I could taste it in the cake.  As others commented, I added extra orange juice to the cake when making it and this worked well to balance the flavour.

This has got to be the best way to use up zucchini.  The cake is moist and doesn't last long in our house.  Be sure to grate the zucchini very fine, and it will absoloutely dissappear into the cake.  I used at least two tablespoons of orange zest and also added a teaspoon of orange extract.  With or without the glaze, it is wonderful.  YUM

Marvelous taste and texture. My only change was to bring glaze to a boil adding 1 Tablespoon butter. Then brush glaze on after turning out on serving plate.

The cake wasn't that tasteful and the Orange Glaze did not enhance the flavor.

This just didn't cut it for hubby and me.  We are zucchini cake fans and none of the flavours in this one seemed to work together.  In fact, there wasn't really any flavour that stood out!  Also, it was overly moist and even with the non-stick pan greased and floured it stuck a bit.  The glaze was bland too.  Sorry, won't be making this one again.

Excellent recipe and very easy. Since I am fond of orange, my only change was to do 1/4 cup of OJ and 1/4 of milk as suggested by other reviewers. They taste so perfect and moist that there might not even be any left to put a glaze or frosting on by the time they cool! This recipe is perfect for adapting for more chocolate or orange flavor or both. I'm leaning towards keeping the strong orange flavor in the cake and making a chocolate ganache for the top.

SO good I made three and gave two away. My dad ate most of the one I gave my parents that day. I added chocolate chips to the batter (about 1 cup. When I drizzled on the glaze I melted some more chocolate chips and drizzled that on top as well. Will make this one again and again.

Wow this turned out super!! I did change a few things, I used 1/2 cup stevia(natural sugar) instead of 2 cups of sugar and I used whole wheat flour. I will make this over and over with the alterations even a diabetic can eat it. Well as long as there's doesn't have the glaze. The orange taste in here is what really did it for me Thanks a ton for a great zucchini cake!!!

I didn't have zucchini but tons of banana so I decided to make this into a Banana Chocolate Orange Cake.  The combination of all the ingredients came out very good. The cake was moist and delicious.  This shows how versatile the recipe is.  Thank you for sharing it with us.  Next time will make it with zucchini (promise) and will add chocolate chips.

Even my picky son loved it until he figured out what the mystery ingredient was!!! It was devoured at our neighbourhood barbecue. The glaze WAS runny...but soaked into the cake which I thought added even more flavor!

My kids love chocolate cake - and they loved this too, despite the zucchini.  The glaze was very runny.  I ended up painting it on with a pastry brush.  It was very delicious!

Wonderful!  I creamed the sugar and butter as instructed but then added the eggs and creamed until light and fluffy.  I alternated adding in the milk combined with vanilla and the flour mixture just to ensure it didn’t separate. I added extra orange zest only because it smelled so good and I couldn’t resist.  I’m so glad I did.  The results were a delicious cake that was moist and had wonderful texture.  I would omit the walnuts the next time just so the orange flavor would take center stage.

This is a wonderful cake! Moist and chocolatey, no one would ever guess there are 3 cups of zucchini in it! I made it for my husband's birthday on Tuesday and I am about to make it again, 2 days later, to take away on a  trip this week end! I changed nothing except for leaving out the nuts.

This cake is so moist and the flavours from the chocolate, orange zest, mingling with the shredded zuchini...hint of cinnamon..wow!!  I gave some to my brother and his girlfriend, my parents took 1/2 the cake and shared it with my uncles, and I had 1/4 of the cake with my boyfriend...everyone talked about it the next day!!  So if you have a big zuchinni and don't know what to do with it, that someone gave you (my mother!)...do this cake!  Oh and the little glaze that you pour over while it's still a little warm...reminded me of the simple glazing on a doughnut. It was wonderful...will do this one again.

Let me tell you. I already don't like making cakes! It's just to messy to me, but i tried this one anyway because i needed something different for a dinner.  WOW...... This cake is awesome and worth the work! I'll will always make this cake!  I also used 3 tablespoons of orange zest. So good.

This is good. It is moist and chocolatey with a tantalizing hint of orange. I am only giving it three stars, though, because - though I am a cake nut and a chocolate nut - for some strange reason I don't feel compelled to eat this in the way I feel compelled to eat most chocolate cake. I've had 1 1/2 pieces in 48 hours, and that's been plenty for me. It doesn't have that addictive, must-eat-more-now quality that I like in a cake. Of course, that's probably a good thing!

Delicious.  I made mine with Triple Sec and orange extract instead of OJ, to get more flavor (and put the Triple Sec in the glaze as well) and added chocolate chips, as some suggested.

Excellent!  With soooo many zucchinis coming out of the garden it is nice to have a little chocolate for a change.  This is the most beautiful cake batter I have ever made.  Eating the raw batter was like Choc Mousse!  Make this now!

This cake is incredible! I made exactly as stated, but in a 9" spring form. Took about 50 minutes to bake. The middle sunk a bit, but that's my own fault for not having a Bundt pan! Make sure to squeeze as much water out of the zucchini as possible after shredding, otherwise this will be way too moist. I did, and it's still insanely moist. Will definitely be making this again!

Very moist cake. Chocolaty without being overpowering. A nice texture, but not cake like. I don't taste the orange in the cake at all. But neither do I taste the zucs either. :) My 8 year old thought it was really good! Easy to make and really yummy! Yes, I'd make it again. THANKS!

This was exceptionally moist and choclately. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I didn't tell anyone there was zucchini in it as I didn't think they would eat it.  I made this for my daughters birthday cake and everyone had big slices.  There is none left.

Wow!  Awesome use of zucchni!  The hint of cinnamon really adds a yummy touch to this cake.  I didn't have orange juice so I iced it with chocolate icing which was heavenly and if you really want to make it decadent, add 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I didn't have a Bundt pan but it worked nicely in a 9x13.

This is a great recipe. For a stronger orange flavor I would suggest using orange extract. It has more flavor than juice or orange rind.

I made this cake today and it turned out very, very moist, almost to the point of being gooey.If I were to make this again, I would decrease the amount of zucchini to two cups.Also I left out the orange zest and doubled the amount of cinnamon, as we love that stuff!! The cooking time was about fifeteen minutes longer in my oven, than what the recipe stated. When cooled ,I put chocolate icing with cinnamon in it.
   It is a tasty cake and a good use of your garden zucchini. It is just a little too gooey for us.

I forgot the cocoa and had a Zucchini Orange Cake and it was fantastic.  It was very popular at a potluck dinner--moist and flavorful.  Will make it again.

If you have never made a zucchini cake (as I hadn't before this one), you must first know that these things have a different flavor/texture.  I know most people probably like it, but the little chunks grossed me out.  I should have just tried a chocolate orange cake recipe and forgotten about the zucchini.  So I am sure this recipe turned out exactly like it should have.  But I won't be making it again.

Delicious cake! The cake also freezes very well! I had some sour cream and yogurt that needed to be used, so I substituted 1/4 cup of sour cream/ yogurt for some of the milk...I made a chocolate frosting for the cake using cream, icing sugar and melted bittersweet chocolate and a tsp of vanilla!  Wonderful recipe!  I will make it again as soon as more zucchini are harvested!

Next time I may try kicking up the orange flavor a hint like some other reviewers suggested, although I could taste the hint of orange when I made the recipe as is. Very moist, tasty, and unique recipe!

Very good- I left out the nuts because of an allergy and it was still great.  I should have paid more attention to the other reviews and adjusted the glaze but it turned out fine anyway.

Just made this this morning for a funeral luncheon. I trimmed the top of the bundt to be able to test it and it was delicious! It was easy, too! p.s. the amount of zest and juice called for is equivalent to about 1 orange. Would definitely make this again and/or try it as cupcakes!

Loved it!  Took one very large and a small onion to get a tbsp. of zest, so I used orange extract in the cake and the glaze.  Made two loaf cakes and poked holes in the top so glaze would sink in.  Very good, zucchini didn't show at all, you could easily fool non-zucchini eaters with this cake.

This recipe was great. After reading most of the reviews I decided to use 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract and the orange zest plus I used dark cocoa powder instead of the regular cocoa. Since I added the orange extract I reduced the amount of vanilla by 1/2 a teaspoon. The cake turned out moist but not gooey and I got the deep chocolate flavor and the with a hint of orange. Just what I wanted! On the glaze I used the exact amount of orange juice called for and 1/8 teaspoon of orange extract. Consistency was just right for a glaze and I had a nice orangy flavor.

Fabulous.  Next time I would add the orange with the wet ingredients.  I think it would be easier to mix in that way.  I reduced the butter to just 1/2 cup and left out the nuts.  It stuck to my bundt pan so I want to try using shortening instead of nonstick spray before I flour it and see if that helps, or try it in a springform pan.  Flavor and texture were excellent.

Excellent. I made it without the cocoa and it turned out great. The walnuts make it taste like a carrot cake, so might try the recipe without walnuts in the future.

So far everyone that has tried this agrees that it is wonderful!!  I've made this recipe twice - the first time I followed the directions fairly closely - I used chocolate & lemon flavoring (would have used orange if I had it) instead of the vanilla and I added a bit more orange zest.  The second time my zucchini was a bit drier, so I added 1/4 orange juice and 1/4 chocolate sauce - mmmmm!  Even better!

Very good cake.  I added freshly grated orange rind to the glaze, for more orange flavor.  I also cut back a bit on the amount of sugar in the cake.

Very good, moist and dense.  Could not really taste orange flavor except for the icing.  Could be more chocolaty.  Next time, I will use baking chocolate instead of cocoa.  Definitely a keeper!

Everyone at my office loved the cake, but I found it to be a bit dry. Perhaps try using more milk. I found that 3 tablespoons of oj to one cup of sugar made a nice glaze. Next time, I may try to cut the cake into even slices, and then pour the glaze over the individual pieces as a means of moistening it up a bit.

Still on my quest to use up the large zucchinis from my garden, I made this tasty cake tonight.  Made as written and baked in a tube pan with the listed glaze.  I agreed with other reviewer's that the glaze was too thin, so I added more sugar to help it out.  I poked holes in the cake and then put on a layer of glaze, waited 10 minutes for it to soak in, and then put on another layer until all glaze was absorbed.  Yummy!

It is a very good cake and I will make it again. I did cut back on both the baking soda and powder  by a half teaspoon each. I will use 2 teaspoons baking powder and a half teaspoon soda next time.

The orange zest changed the taste way more than I expected and we absolutely loved it! Hard to only have one piece! Will for sure make this again!

This cake is the bomb! It's a wee labor intensive--especially when you are catering to all the allergies in our household. I substituted the flour with a GF all-purpose flour mix, the milk with almond milk, the walnuts with chopped almonds, and the butter with oil. The texture is terrific: moist with a nutty flair. My non-allergy friends couldn't believe it was free of all the regular stuff. While it's not an every day cake, it's perfect for a special occasion.

Delicious.  Probably added more zucchini than stated, so it took about 20minutes longer to bake, but it’s awesomely delicious and will make again and again.  Will top with a chocolate orange ganache next time. Just to mix things up.  However, this is so flavorful you don’t even need a glaze. Well worth the effort.

I substituted 1/2 t of orange oil for the orange zest. I didn't drain or squeeze the zucchini. I substituted a handful of chocolate chips for the walnuts.  I omitted the glaze. It was delicious, and I'll make it again.

I made these into muffins instead of a cake and omitted the glaze. Loved how they turned out. I did double the orange zest and uses flax seed in place of the eggs (because i was out of eggs). They turned out moist and not too sweet

I only gave this 4 stars because I made a couple changes as per the reviews. I used half milk and half orange juice, substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter, and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I also baked it for 45 minutes in my convection oven. For the glaze I added cocoa and orange zest to the icing sugar and orange juice.
   I made this cake for work and it didn't  go over well, but we loved it. The zucchini makes it a heavy cake, but it's very moist .With the extra orange juice,  there's a nice chocolate orange flavour, and not too sweet. I will definitely be making this again.

I'm already a fan of cakes that derive their moist factor from zucchini, and this one is no different. What I was after today was a super moist orange cake that does NOT start from boxed cake mix. Mine is an orange white chocolate cake rather, so...  I replaced the cocoa powder with white chocolate pudding powder, I replaced the milk with OJ, added orange extract, and more rind as well. To balance, I reduced the sugar, made sure to squeeze out excess liquid from the zucchini, and added white chocolate coins to the batter. I was glad to see that this can be baked in a non-bundt way. The glaze is easy and nice too. I recommend this forgiving recipe to anyone looking to enjoy a super moist and lovely cake that goes well alone or with a nice cup of coffee/tea.

Made this with whole wheat, raw brown sugar & olive oil; instead of the white flour, white sugar and butter.  Delightfully rich and delicious.  Still need to work on a healthier and thicker glaze.

This is amazing. I added a bit more oil and added chocolate chips as well. Heavy on the Orange rind too. This was so decadent and I couldn't stop eating. It doesn't even matter it has zucchini in it. I want it for my bday for years o come!

Delicious! All the combinations of zucchini, cinnamon, chocolate and orange are perfect. A decadent way to end a meal (or, let's be honest, to start a day). Great, different way to use up garden fresh or frozen zucchini.

Perfect as posted.  Very moist & flavourful.  I served it with a dollop of whip cream which I added Grand Marnier.    For those concerned.... you cannot taste or feel the texture of zucchini at all.

I had zucchini I needed to use, but my partner is NOT a fan of squash of any kind. This recipe was a perfect solution.  I waited until he inhaled a slice before I asked if he noticed any distinctive ingredients.  "um some kind of nut?" hahaha...

Fabulous recipe! Incredibly moist. I use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder, which provides that deep, dark yumminess. Additionally, for the glaze I used 1/8 cup O.J. and 1/8 cup triple sec.

My husband thinks it's the best cake we've ever made. He loves the moist, soft texture it produces and we both love how it is not too sweet. However, we reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups, so it's probably much sweeter as written.

Absolutely wonderful! This turned out moist and delicious, not too sweet, and that hint of orange made it perfect. Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I added about 1/2 tsp of orange extract to give it a stronger orange taste and it tasted great that way. I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any, and I think it would be great either way. I will definitely be making this one again!

I have been baking for over 50 years, love trying new recipes, bake breads, do cake decorating etc. This recipe for some reason did not turn out. I followed it exactly, it ended up very crumbly, could not even slice it, will use it in a pudding layered dessert as a crumb layer. Hope others have better results.

This is a very good, very moist cake, and with 3 cups of zucchini, is a great way to get rid of a big zucchini! I followed the recipe exactly, (except maybe added a touch more cocoa due to bad measurement) and it was very good and moist.  I think this cake would be a good candidate for a cream-cheese orange icing, the cream cheese would cut the sweetness  bit.  I think the nuts add a necessary texture crunch.  It WON'T overflow your pan if you use the right-sized pan!  (Don't use a small one) As always, DON'T use frozen zucchini!

This was amazing!!  My family asked for seconds.  I added a cup of chocolate chips.  Seemed to take a little longer baking than recommended but came out moist and full of flavor.  Excellent!!  I would make this over a regular chocolate cake any day!

This cake came out so moist and rich that everyone wanted the recipe!  I did make a few substitutions.  I substituted 1 tsp of orange extract in place of 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Instead of adding milk, I used 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also added 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Not as moist as I was expecting based on other reviews, but still it was good.  Maybe it would have been a little more moist if I had used 3 packed cups of zucchini instead of just using it as it fell.  I didn't drain it. Used 1 tsp of orange extract instead of the zest but would probably use slightly more next time. Only used 1/4c of walnuts, which was plenty for me. It baked up very nicely. The glaze was just ok, I think it needs less liquid because it all just ran immediately down to the plate and it didn't look like it had any glaze on it.

Great recipe. Doubled the orange juice and poured the mixture over the cake when it came out of the oven. By the time it had cooled it had all soaked in and the result was a tangy moist cake. A lovely change from the usual zuchini cake recipes.

It was rather dry but tasty. Next time will put in only 1 cup of zucchini.

Ohhhh  how delicious!!!  This cake came out nice and moist, full of flavour.  Better than anything from a store, and I would say almost as moist as a boxed cake!  I did a few alterations:  1 1/4 cups of honey instead of sugar, canola oil instead of butter, no salt (I know salt supposedly makes baking taste better, but I don't care for it), and I added some nutmeg and I skipped the walnuts.  I would say sifting the dry ingredients is key to making this cake so light and fluffy, and then adding them to the wet ingredients afterwards.  I used all of the zest of an orange, and then all of the juice from the orange in the icing.  Oh my, this was just heaven!  Thanks for the recipe, it's my new favorite cake :)
