This has to be one of the best tasting potato soup recipes I've tried.  I think next time I will try adding some shredded cheese in the last step or stir some into a hot bowl of soup for an added kick.

I did find that this recipe takes much longer to prepare than the recipe states.  The times listed in the preparation are assuming you're starting out with peeled/diced potatoes, chopped onions, chopped celery, etc.  If you have none of this prepared ahead of time (and who does?) then this recipe will take much longer to make.  Sure, it's worth the time it takes to make it...but don't use this recipe for as last-minute dinner when you're in a hurry or when you're really tired and just wanting a good soup.  It took me about two hours to make this from start to finish.

The cooking of the potatoes in the middle of the recipe before the stock is added is an excellent step and it helps the potatoes cook much faster than they would have just by boiling alone.  The puree step at near the end is very important.  It highly affected the texture and flavor of the soup.  Don't skip that step!

Also, please don't think that "chicken broth" and "chicken stock" are the same thing.  They're not!  I wasn't able to find chicken stock at Walmart, I had to go to Albertsons.  If you use chicken broth you'll get a much different result.

I also noticed this recipe has no salt added.  I did find adding salt to my bowl of soup helped the flavor even more.  I suggest adding some salt!

I read all the top reviews and nobody has mentioned this before so maybe it's not a big deal to some...but I thought the bacon would be SO much better if it wasn't boiled with the potatoes (after cooking it.)  It lost it's flavor and became soggy!  I think it would be so much better added at the end, after everything was pureed.  Just my $.02.

Good base soup to build on for personal preference.  I felt the soup definitely lacked flavor, but wasn't sure if it was me, so I asked hubby to taste it.  Immediate response; "terrible"!  Thought he was kidding me, but alas, he was not....   Back to the stove top it went; added chicken boullion to give the soup more complexity and depth, extra garlic, white pepper (better with cream bases than black pepper), leeks, celery, garlic salt, tsp of hot pepper sauce, dried parsley and a tad bit more tarragon.  Didn't need to puree the soup as the potatoes melted away.  Ultimate potato soup with additions!

Thank you so much for letting us enjoy this wonderful soup. It was one of the last things my Father tasted before he died of lung cancer. It was amazing how much he ate of this soup even though he had a hard time getting it down trough his throut because of the cancer. it was very very much worth it.

so in the spirit of john van liempt, 
               enjoy

This was by far one of the best Potato Soup recipes I've ever prepared!  It is a bit involved and time consuming (don't believe the prep or cook times posted here), but it was sooo worth it!  I added carrot and used chicken broth.  Yes, stock is better, but if you don't have it handy, broth works just fine.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a fan of red potatoes, skin on; use them in this recipe as well!  In step 3 skip the pur√©e part.  It's a needless mess and complication!  Near the end, when the potatoes are soft, simply mash it about 4 to 5 times with a masher and achieve the same results, without the time, mess and added cleanup.  Top with your favorite grated cheese, sliced green onion and some crumbles of the bacon you've set aside.  Enjoy!

I have made this soup several times for many different people.  Everyone LOVES it!  I don't add the tarragon or cilantro nor do I puree at the end, it is still absolutely delicious.  I read in a previous review not to use canned chicken broth...I do!  I'm looking forward to my first cold weather batch, it's worth every bit of the effort!

This TRULY is the best potato soup you could ever have. Rich, creamy, full of flavor. You won't find better in a can or at a restaurant. The only change I will make next time is I'll use leeks instead of onions. Simply because I think leeks in soup adds the most delicious flavor. You definetly should give this soup a try!

This was pretty good.  My wife noted that the bacon flavor seemed to overpower everything else, but other than that she really liked it.  

I don't know how to process the words "too much bacon", so I can't comment on that.

Ultimate comfort food! I've made this recipe many times & it is always a hit with my family/friends. I personally don't care for tarragon, so i use rosemary instead of the tarragon & cilantro. Tip for those who are concerned with the amount of time spent chopping the veggies - i chop celery, onions & bell peppers up as soon as i buy them & put them in the freezer in zip lock bags. When I'm ready  to make this soup (or any other recipe) I just grab my pre-chopped vegs. from freezer and add them frozen to the pot.

This soup was awesome!  The only change from the recipe that I made was to use fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the flour and cream, and it didnt need the flour anyway!  When I pureed for a minute, it thickened up nicely!.  The tarragon gave it a really nice flavor...will make again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I scaled it down to four servings, but after tasting it, I wished I had made the full recipe. I never use chicken stock because it's a little bland. I always cover my potatoes with the water and add chicken bullion cubes for a richer taste. Try leaving out the cilantro and add cooked crumbled Italian sausage with a cup of kale for an exciting Italian tasting soup.--Summerk

Thankyou! Karena. What a rich & decadent soup!!  As I'm devouring every bite. I feel like I just went to a 5 Star Restaurant and ordered their "best" soup.  My family and my daughters 9 year old friend couldn't get enough.  Excellent. I had no choice to do some things different, I did not have any Tarragon and I used 1/3 of the cilantro(I didn't like the taste of the cilantro plain so I was afraid if I put the 3 tsps. it called for, I thought I might not like the soup... but in fact when the soup was done it tasted like it needed something, so I threw in one tsp. of the cilantro and a little more salt and pepper. It was the best soup I have ever made.  Oh! also, My Ten year old Daughter (who's finiky) only like it after I added Shedded Cheddar Cheese to hers. 
Served with Fresh French Bread and Butter.  WHAT A HIT!!!  I will definitly be making this again, especially at my next big Holiday gathering.  I want my WHOLE Family to enjoy this delectable soup

The Best!!  You'll add more tarragon once you taste test on the stove like I did.  It's the key.  To save dirty dishes, mess and time, don't remove half to puree, just send in the old fashioned "HAND" potato masher for 5 or so mashes.  You do not want to make mashed potatoes.  Hold off on throwing the bacon back in until ready to serve and let the person eating it add salt in their individual bowl to taste.  I'll make this recipe on a regular basis.
Thanks alot!!

For those of you (like me) that simply cannot enjoy a meal that has too much fat and cholestorol try this for the authors step #3:    3 TBS margarine (no cholestorol, same amount fat) 1/4 cup flour 1 12 oz can Carnation Evaporated Fat Free Milk (no fat, no cholestorol)  I left in the bacon-come on!  i'm not that good- and this soup is GREAT!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made this soup for dinner last night and my family loved it.  I used half & half and omitted the tarragon.  I also went a little easy on the garlic.  We are not big garlic eaters around here.  I had the cheddar cheese ready to add to my bowl, but changed my mind after the first bite.  It didn't need the cheese to make it any better. I can't wait to show this one off to my friends.  Thanks for the recipe!

I adjusted this recipe to cook in my crockpot. My potatoes were organic reds, I just layered them in the crockpot covering with the organic broth and cooked them until fork tender, about four hours. I mushed the potatoes in the crockpot with my handheld potato masher leaving chunky bits, then added the crumbled bacon and the vegetables that I sauteed in a couple tablespoons of the bacon grease and a tablespoon of butter. I only needed about a 1/4 cup of fat free evaporated milk which left the soup thick without adding flour and creamy without being too fatty. This was good, but we didn't really care for the combination of tarragon and cilantro with the potatoes. It's not the recipe's issue, it's just our tastes, I guess.  Next time, I'll leave those out. This was an easy recipe to make in the crockpot which I appreciated.

Excellent!  Never made potato soup before and this was quite a find.  Didnt use cilantro because quite honestly Im from Phoenix where everything has cilantro in it.  I will make it again adding it though.  Also I used 1/2 c. of 1/2 and 1/2 and a full cup of milk in lieu of the cream.  It is really a thick soup, I like my consistancy a little thinner.  Didnt puree the potatoes either, they cooked down quite nicely, so I just used a wire wisk to break them up a little more.  Used half bacon in the soup and saved the other half for topping.  All in all great flavor and very easy, thanks for the recipe!

was looking for a creamy potatoe soup with bacon and came across this one.  It is fabulous!!! Didn't need to puree though. After stirring in the cream mixture, the soup puree'd itself ... I let is simmer for 2 hours vs. the 20 min. I would definitely recommend this recipe to others.

Gotta agree---this is the Absolute Ultimate Potato Soup!  We're in the middle of an ice storm here in southern PA.  There's already almost a foot of snow on the ground.  Seemed a perfect time to make this soup.  It is fabulous.  Working with what I had on hand (which was everything except heavy cream, cilantro & tarragon,) this soup turned out marvelous nonetheless.  I only used half a pound of bacon and that was perfect.  I added about a tablespoon of dried parsley to the roux and it worked well.  (I always have dried parsley flakes in my freezer---and chicken stock.)  I also substituted Half & Half for the heavy cream, but not in the interest of calorie-cutting.  It's just what I had on hand.  It, too, worked just fine.  Thanks, Karena, for sharing this wonderful, wonderful soup.

That was very tasty.. I do plan to make it without the bacon added the next time and try it with butter as I thought it was a little heavy in the bacon flavor. I also added my flour to the potatoes when I added them to the pot to saute'.. then when I added the broth it blended quite nicely without the addition of another dirty pan to wash. I just added my lowfat cream and seasonings after boling the potatoes in the broth for about 18 minutes. I also didn't add the cilantro as I am allergic to it. I added a little sage and some chives instead. it was good that way.I will add bacon and cheese to the soup when serving it to give it a little bacon flavoring. This soup did take me about 2 and half hours to make. I will make it again, but this time with my changes. Thanks!!

I have not tried this recipe; but from reading it, and with 60 years of cooking experience, I can tell you that what it lacks is a touch of acid. I would add during the last 3 minutes cook-time, 1/4 cup GOOD white wine or if that is a problem for some cooks, some other acid - lemon juice in a lesser amount, or apple cider vinegar by a tablespoon.

Before I met my husband, I used a different recipe.  He introduced me to this one, and once I tasted it, I was sold.  Now it is our go-to recipe for potato soup.  What makes this so good is the bacon.  We reserve some of the bacon to top the bowl, and also top it with cheese and green onions if I have it.  They have the title of this soup correct - absolutely the best potato soup ever!

This potato soup was pretty good once I doctored it up.  I felt it needed a lot more salt than called for.  I also used dill instead of cilantro on the advice of other reviewers. It was easy to make  and came together quite well.  It was a little too thick, so I ended up adding additional milk to the recipe.  My only real complaint is that it doesn't do well as leftovers...it's the consistency of mashed potatoes and it needs to be thinned out so much when reheated, that it loses a lot of it's flavor.  I'll make this again, because it was delicious, but next time I will add more liquid, less flour and prolly add some carrots and corn.  I'll be making it to send with my hubby for hunting season!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe!!! I knew I would like it from the beginning; anything with bacon and potatoes is good for me. Perfect amout of creaminess and smoky bacon flavor. The only one change I made was, instead of sauteeing the onions and celery in the bacon fat, I ussed about 1/4 cup butter. Still great and cant' wait to make it agian!

I've made this soup twice now and it has been amazing. I use half and half instead of heavy cream and it is still great. Finally, leftovers to look forward to!

The kids really like it, but it didn't wow me.  I really like the texture, but I needed more flavor.  Also was way to thick, I added about a cup of milk or more extra to thin it out. (Followed the recipe exactly except for the extra milk).

Great recipe.  Good with ham or sausage too.  I usually make a double batch.  The prepping of the potatoes and onions is no big deal for me.  I love making things from scratch and doing all the prep work.  It makes me feel like I've accomplished something good.  The only change I did to this recipe is I didn't add the tarragon.  Tarragon is not my favorite flavor.  I find it very distasteful. A pinch of Rubbed Sage adds an interesting taste. Also, I use more Heavy cream. This is on my list of SUPER COMFORT FOODS.....  {:0)

Amazing recipe!!! The only thing I did different was I nixed the celery and tarragon. For seasoning, I used basil, parsley and thyme. And I topped it with scallions, cheddar and bacon. Got my whole family hooked!

I am giving this 4 stars because hubby loved it.  Me, nope!  Not that the taste wasn't good, because, it was.  Just wasn't creamy enough for me.  Made it exactly as directed, no changes.

Excellent soup and the recipe is written very well...very easy to follow.  The only thing I did differently was the bacon...I had left over bacon from breakfast, so I chopped it and added it when the recipe called for it ( I had saved the grease too).  I really think the soup has great flavor and I like the consistency!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

After the following changes, this soup is very good. I didn't add cilantro or tarragon and I didn't puree the soup and I used canned milk instead of heavy cream and I added some velveta cheese, so it was really a cheesy/potato soup.

I tweaked this to my liking also.  I cooked onions and celery in butter, not bacon grease.  Also used whole milk instead of cream.  I omitted cilantro an tarragon and used dill instead.  I also only put about 3 pieces of bacon back into the soup and and left the rest to put on top when I serve it.  This soup was very tasty, rich, and creamy.  When I made the roux, I cooked it until it was fairly thhick before adding it to the soup.  I will make this again!

Loved this soup. I used butter instead of the bacon fat, and used only 6 good sized potatoes but it was still plenty :) I never thought these cream soups would be so easy to make with just ingredients already in my pantry. Next time, will try adding some shredded cheddar during the cooking process for some extra "oomph". Wonderful light supper with some bread YUMMY!

This is one of our favorite soups. I dice the bacon before frying and usually use only 1/2 pound of bacon as you need a little taste but don't need that many calories. I also use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream to cut calories and it works fine. We also like 1 c. or 1 can of drained corn in our potato soup. This is just a nice comfort food and always goes well with the family.

This was delicious!  I omitted bacon and added sliced kielbasa along with the potatoes.  Didn't add the herbs as I didn't have them.  Used canned broth which worked fine.  The flour/butter mixture became VERY thick very quickly after adding the cream, enough that I was a bit worried, but it turned out fine when added to the broth/potatoes.  Rather than blending some of the soup I just mashed it a few times with a pastry cutter.  Wonderful flavor and texture.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We loved this, including my toddler.  I didn't have cream, so I used milk. I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used dried.  I also had 3/4 of a pound of bacon, which was plenty.  Delicious.

This soup received mixed reviews in the family. Several of us, including myself, loved or really liked it; two of the kids thought that the tarragon was too strong, overpowering the other flavors in the soup. Overall a good soup, though the prep time, as others have noted, is WAY under-stated. I'll probably make this again but cut the tarragon by about 1/3 to see how it turns out.

This soup was as amazing as other users have said. I changed up the onions in mine since I didn't have any on hand and my roommate doesn't like them so instead used about a tablespoon of minced dried. I felt this was perfect and that if I had used actual onions it might have taken away from the delicious smooth flavor and consistency. So for once leaving out the onions for my roomie didn't detract from an awesome recipe.

A lot of work and it wasn't bad but it really lacked alot. The prep time and cook time is also way off. I added cheese just cause my family loves cheese and I am glad I did cause it is the only thing that helped it.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I used leeks instead of onions because I had some that needed to be used up.  And I used fat free half and half instead of the cream.  As another reviewer mentioned, I live in the southwest and cilantro is in everything, and it was not the flavor I wanted in my soup, so I used a bit of thyme instead.  My family loved this soup, and the leftovers tasted even better when we ate it for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the recipe, Karena!

This makes a delicious soup.  Several other reviewers commented that the recipe calls for too much cornstarch so I decided to wait until the soup was almost done and I found that I didn't need the cornstarch at all.  The soup was very thick and creamy.  I will be making this again when the weather turns cooler.

I've made a soup like this for decades and it's the best.  However, it's even better if a 14.5 oz.can of creamed corn is added to it, AND right before serving, add a tablespoon or so of red wine vinegar.  Just heightens the flavors a lot.

This was quick and easy to make for a delicious cream of potato soup.  I only changed a few things.  I only used 1/2 lb of bacon and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream.  you can problably use milk too if that is what you have on hand.  The potatos itself make the soup very creamy.  I also left out the tarragon and cilantro, and topped off my soup with fresh chives..yummy!!  PS:  try and use low sodium chicken broth to cut down on the salt.  You can even sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top too!!

Absolutely Ultimate is right!! It does take longer than 10 min for prep time, peeling, chopping, dicing takes a while.  I did not have tarragon or cilantro to use, made no substitution.  The cream sauce never got to the boiling point, it thickened and I mean thickened way before that.  Next time I may use less flour.  I pureed most of the soup and left a few chunks of potatoes.  I never added salt or pepper, it was just fine.  I was going to put some shredded Cheddah cheese at the end but I forgot, next time.

This really is a pretty perfect soup - as is. I get nothing but compliments when I make it. Very creamy, but not overly so - good amount of potatoes versus soup. Very hearty and comforting.

My family considers itself potato soup connosieurs (sp?!) and they LOVED this!!!!!  I made a wonderful cheese bread to go with it on a cold, raw day, and my family ate it till they were stuffed.  My 4 year-old granddaughter, who rarely eats much of anything, came back later for two more bowls and literally licked the bowl!  It's calorious, but at least it's worth the calorie hit if you don't have it too often.  But watch out!  It can be addictive!!!

I will give it 4 stars because my hubby gobbled it up greedily, had seconds, and took some for lunch today. I didnt care for it though :-) Only because I dont really like bacon and to me it felt like I was eating bacon grease (I have NEVER cooked with bacon grease before!!!) I mean it tasted good for the most part, but I am somewhat of a health nut, so it was hard for me to eat this. OTHER THAN MY PHOBIA of bacon, it was a hit here. My hubby was so happy to have something not totally focused on healthy healthy healthy! He loved it. He thought it was perfect and delicious and is hoping I feel nice again and make it another time down the road! So if you like bacon, this just might be the soup for you!

If I make this again I will saute in butter NOT bacon grease.  It gave it a "bacon grease" taste that really overwhelmed the other ingredients.  I agree with others that it needs additional spices also.

With a name like "Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup", I had to try it.  Unfortunately, this was one of the most disappointing of the 5 star recipes I've tried here.  The flavor was bland, oddly enough, almost a faint fishy taste, which I cannot explain.  The next day it was very thick and reheating didn't improve texture or flavor.  Maybe b/c this is the type of potato soup that isn't topped with cheddar cheese and scallions, more like a baked potato soup, it was bland?  Don't know.  Went into the circular file, not the success file.

Thought it was great! I think it would be good as the recipe says, but I did make a few changes - leeks instead of onions; skim milk instead of cream; and skipped the flour. The soup was thick enough wo flour ... after the potatoes were soft, I mashed them up a bit, then just added milk. And I added at least 3 cups of milk, just to thin it a bit. Also, the tarragon made me nervous bc I don't really know a lot about tarragon, but I went for it and am glad I did! I think it's a nice, mild addition. Thanks for this recipe!

I've adjusted this recipe a bit over a few batches. That said, the recipe is pretty good as-is.

Instead of cubing the potatoes and then blending the soup later, I used 7 shredded russet potatoes and 5 cubed gold potatoes, no blending. I think red potatoes would also be really good for cubing. Also I doubled the bacon and onion, added about a cup of shredded carrots, and used 1L chicken broth and topped it up with beef broth (about 500mL, enough to cover potatoes).

Also, FWIW, corn starch is much faster acting than flour as a thickener.

I am a traditionalist, I guess and although this soup was okay first time around. Left the tarragon, cilantro out and added flat leaf parsley.  I roasted the garlic since I like the mellow flavor imparted by the roasting.  Added a few red pepper flakes - only enough for flavor, left the skin on the potatoes and followed another users idea to use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 but only.  Mashed some of the potatoes (not all just some) rather than puree and still got the natural thickening from them. Didn't use the flour for thickenening as we have people with gluten allergies. Came out wonderful.  Only boiled for awhile at the beginning to cook the potatoes.  After that, because I used no flour, I only used medium setting heat.

Great soup! I used a really lean bacon, Fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and instead of tarragon, I threw in a couple bay leaves. Also, a little trick I learned to thicken soup like this... no puree is needed, I just used a potato masher a few strokes and the soup is thickened perfectly without loosing any potato hunks.I like lots of potato in my potato soup and prefer the hunks of potato as opposed to a smooth soup. Also a great soup to experiment with...using chicken sausage, or ham, kielbasa...it all works well. You can also add Kale for an added nutritional boost. Mmmmm!

I made this for a friend who just had surgery. I left out the bacon because she doesn't eat pork. I substituted leeks for the onions.. She said it was the best potato soup she has ever eaten. I agreed that it was delicious.I made another recipe for me a n my husband later in the day. I didn't make any changes to the recipe this time. Both my husband and I loved it hot out of the pot--exceptional yum factor. The next day my friend came over and we heated it up. It was even more flavorful than it had been two days before. This recipe is a winner! It is my recipe box permanently!

This is the greatest potato soup for those cold winter days. It may cost a little more for ingredients and be thick in flavor, but follow it exactly and you will be pleased. My wife loves this! She often asks about this recipe when she tries another that leaves her wanting this one. The bacon and heavy cream hook you with the taragon balancing the celery and garlic in each savory spoonful.

Well, my picky hubby (the anti cheese/creamy man) turned his nose up at this, but I really enjoyed it.  Very filling especially if paired with cornbread or crackers.  I love mine with a good dose of freshly ground black pepper.  Just wanted to share my thoughts...thankx Karena.

This is very similar to my favorite potato soup recipe but I only use 2 or 3 slices of bacon, and half and half, rather than cream.  And instead of the tarragon and cilantro, try marjoram. You won't need much.  About 1/4 of a tsp. to start. It's such a nice spice in cream of potato soup and also cream of broccoli soup. Well worth experimenting with.

This soup was fantastic!  I made it almost per the recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I added a cup of carrots and subbed flat leaf parsley for the cilantro.  I also did not blend half the soup and add it back in.  I only blended about 4 cups and it was perfect!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Truly wonderful recipe and just the right consistency!!! I replaced the onions with (3) leeks and omitted the tarragon and cilantro--didn't have on hand and it was still an excellent.  Next time I will try it with the herbs.  Followed instructions as noted!  Thank you for a great recipe I will be using over and over again.

Everyone was right! This was devine! I made it exactly as the recipe said except minus the terragon simply because I didn't have any. I didn't take half the soup out to puree- I just used my potato masher in the pot and it came to a perfect consistency that way. I will top with cheddar. It is sooo good! And makes a huge pot, perfect for a big family or gathering. YUM!

YUMMY!  However, I will not puree next time as I think it makes the soup too mushy (the taste was better before this step).  Either do the bacon at the very end or make sure it is very crispy.  I also didn't use cilantro.  The taste was very good, but AMAZING the next day!

I am 31 years old and I have never cooked anything in my life.  I was nervous about this "adventure."  I was so proud of myself when I tried the first bite.  It was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I disagreed upon was the prep time, unless you have your own personal line of chefs waiting on you.  It took about 30-45 minutes to prepare all the ingredients, but it was definitely well worth the time spent.  Thank You!!!

This is the BEST potato soup I have had.  Ever.  Better than any restaurant or any family members recipe.  If you have a little bit of time, and want a lot of praise, this is what I would go for.  Beer Bread is great for sopping up the bottom of the bowl.  Karena, thank you so very  much for submitting this!  Wonderful!

I thought this soup was delicious!!! Entire family LOVED it (includes 3 and 7 year olds). My mom said it was the best soup she's ever had :-) Next time I will serve it with crispy bread for dipping.

I did hold out half the bacon and added it at the end - served topped with sharp cheddar cheese. I will definitely be making this again and again!

Delicious and don't be afraid to use bacon fat. Bacon fat/lard has 40% less saturated fat then butter. However it's about comfort factor and taste to me so I us a 50/50 mixture of butter and bacon fat for lots of things that I fry, brown or saute.

I always read the reviews of recipes on this site, but never respond.  This recipe was perfect just the way it is.  My entire family loves potato soup and I was looking for a better one than the one I used.  This is a definite keeper!!  The prep time wasn't bad at all, it only took me 20 minutes to chop everything while the bacon was cooking.  Thanks for this perfect soup recipe!!

The idea of cooking everything in bacon grease was fabulous!  It lent a great smoky flavor to the soup, but I think next time I would just use the leftover fat (I saved it in the fridge) and not put in the bacon, because I don't particularly like the texture of it in the soup.  Or maybe add back the crispy bacon at the very end.  This is something I just decided to make on a whim and then realized I didn't have heavy cream or chicken stock, or celery, so I subbed in milk and chicken broth and tossed in some celery salt.  Skipped the tarragon and cilantro too, as I didn't have those either!  I added some sliced baby carrots to pretend I was having some vegetables with my dinner.  I decided at the last minute to toss in about 6 oz of cream cheese in the cream mixture, since I didn't use the cream.  I think that made all the difference in the taste of this one.  Very thick (I skipped the pureeing part as well) but very delicious!

This recipe was delicious! Even my husband, who is a picky eater, loved it! I did have to change a few tings though for our families preferences. I added extra bacon, left out the celery and cilantro, since my husband wont eat them, and replaced tarragon with dried parsley and chives, since i didnt not have tarragon handy. I am giving this 5 stars because though I did make changes to the recipe I think this recipe could only be more delicious with the addition of the originally ingrediance, as long as you dont have picky eaters in your family like mine, haha. The previous reviewers do make an excellant point when saying the recipe takes much longer than 40 minutes. From begining to chop and prep everything to serving the soup took about 2 hours for me. So this is not a last minute meal, but when you have the time it is definately worth making!

Didn't have tarragon, so I used Mrs. Dash (original). I did not add the bacon until the end, and I used it as a topping with some shredded Vermont Cheese. Other than that I made this exactly as directed. VERY VERY VERY good!!!

Just finished two bowls of this rich, creamy and delicious soup!  The only change I made was to substitute fresh parsley for the cilantro.  When I make it again, I will use very little or no tarragon at all.  I just tasted it too much.  But what a great recipe!

I used this recipe as a base for making my mom's tuna potato chowder, as it calls for condensed potato soup and I didn't have any on hand.  I omitted the celery and replaced it with green bell pepper and added a few cans of tuna.  I also didn't put in the tarragon or cilantro.  It was wonderful, and close to my mom's recipe, so I will use this one from now on since the condensed potato soup has other junk in it I don't want my family to eat anyway.  Thanks!

Delish!  I didnt use the terragon or cilantro because I didnt have any.. also i could not use the onion as my hubby doesn't like them.  I used a touch more garlic and some epicure onion spice that seemed to do the trick.  Just remember that when you puree potatoe it turns into a glue like consistancy quickly so watch.  I forgot and the soup is a touch thicker than I would have liked but the flavour is excellent!

This soup is awesome! Smells amazing and looks very good too. About to dig in! I followed the recipe exactly besides using a little extra bacon grease to saute the onions and celery, and a little tiny bit extra heavy cream because it was the last in the bottle. It is outstanding! Serving it with cheese bread!! :D Thank you

This turned out just like mom's =) !! Used thick, center cut bacon, chopped up. Center cut cooks up more meaty less fat, fixng the soggy bacon problem as some reveiwers have noted.  Used extra garlic and a can of whole kernal corn. Didn't bother with the tarragon or cilantro. So thick and creamy. More like a chowder. Garlic cheese texas toast completes the meal. Perfect for these frigid Michigan winter nights ~ Family Fav! Thanks!

MOST AMAZING POTATO SOUP EVER! Both my husband and I ("I" being the biggest critic out of the two) agreed this is the best potato soup we've ever had. I love putting extra work into my cooking, I'm not one for the "easy" recipes. If you don't do the steps the way it asks, I think it would disappoint you. I followed it exactly, and even added the taragon and cilantro bc although smelling the two on my chopping board didn't seem "right", it ended up being perfect - neither herb had any remote overpowering taste in the soup, very faint at that, but was just right, you could barely notice it really. I like my soups thick but this wasn't super thick or thin, it was really just right, and this was the PERFECT consistency. I have to be fair though and say that I did 2 things differently: 1, I didnt do the puree step. The reason being that when the whole soup was brought to a boil and that step came up, I tasted the soup, looked at the soup, and well, was just really happy with the way it was. 2, I added about a half cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a tablespoon of black pepper. I LOVED this soup this way - but would be willing to give it a shot with the puree'd version and also omitting the cheese, just to see what happens. I am not even a cheese lover, but to me, I felt it would put this soup just right over the top in flavor, and it sure did. KUDO'S TO THIS RECIPE - FINALLY, POTATO SOUP DONE RIGHT! WOOHOO! ***DEFINITELY WORTH ALL THE EXTRA WORK*** Oh, and in regards to the

YUMMO!!!  This soup is amazing!  Like some other reviewers, I did find it a little thick so I just added some milk.  I didn't blend any of it because when I stirred in the flour mixture the potatoes broke up perfectly, leaving just the right amount of chunks.  I only added about half the bacon to the soup, reserving the other half to sprinkle on top which I am glad I did.  I also sprinkled some cheese and green onions on top.  Oh, and I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was plenty creamy.  And I had no cilantro but thought it was great without (will add it next time if I have some on hand, just didn't think it was worth buying just for this).  My boyfriend is already asking when I'm going to make this again!

Absolutely OUTSTANDING!  I followed everything perfectly, except using salt and pepper to taste, and added a little extra garlic powder to the cooking potatoes.  I also left off the tarragon and cilantro (allergies).  You really didn't need them.  I blended half the mixture and that is what really made it nice and thick.  I served shredded cheese and sliced green onion on the side for toppers.  OMG, SO GOOD!  This is a keeper, thank you so much!

Made this soup again last night for guests, and as always, they raved about it. Company ALWAYS loves this soup. Being veg, we leave out the bacon, upping the butter as suggested, and use vegetable broth instead of chicken, and the flavour is amazing. Thank you for sharing! Love this recipe.

The name of this soup really says it all.  It is awesome.  I liked it better than my moms homemade potato soup that I have ate all of my life.  I added a few carrots for color and they tasted great with the potatoes.

I love this recipe! I use Turkey Bacon,Low Fat Chicken Broth and substitute half the heavy cream with 2% milk, for a lower fat content. It is still incredible!

This was a great recipe. I have never really made a potato soup before, and this was not to complicated. I would recommend that you cook the bacon and then crumble by hand to make the pieces. I for some reason thought it would be easier to cut the bacon before cooking. (Duh...)I would also use caution while making the cream sauce. It can thicken very quickly. I will be making this again.

This recipe deserves its name!  I generally do not like potato soup, however my husband does. I made this for him, and I Loved it!  The bacon makes it awesome!!!  Next time I would change to 1 stalk of celery (not a big fan) And I used 3 - 1/8th tsp of minced garlic, and Parsley instead of cilantro.  This was wonderful, I will be making it again very soon!  Definatly worth all the chopping and dicing!!!

This is a great soup! What a nice dinner for a cool evening (or a hot one for that matter). Everybody loved it, even my children. We reheated for lunch the next day and shared some with a friend, who quickly asked for the recipe!

My husband and I loved it!  Very yummy.  My 9 year old said he didn't like the bacon in it.  Actually, next time I think I'll sprinkle crumbled bacon over the top of the soup instead of mixing it in, because it gets 'soggy' when it's cooked in (soggy bacon is not kid friendly!).  Also, I used 2% milk instead of cream and it was just as good I'm sure. There was no need to take out some soup and puree it.  It cooks right down with just the right amount of lumps of potato left in it without doing so, and it saves cleaning the blender too.  Didn't put in cilantro because didn't have it.

It's a super recipe as it is. 
I made some big changes to seriously skinny it down. First, I left in the bacon for smoky flavor -- but only used six strips of bacon and cooked it in a defatting pan. I omitted all but a tablespoon of the bacon grease or butter as called for. Instead of heavy cream, a mix of half skim milk and half nonfat sour cream was used. I used nonfat, low-sodium chicken broth. 

The result: a dieter's dream, and a pretty darn good potato soup.

I literally just finished the cooking this recipe. It is sitting on the stove as we speak. My boyfriend had a tooth extracted this morning and he loves potato soup so I searched the internet for "top rated potato soup recipe." I came across 3 recipes and found this one with over a remarkable 1000 reviews and a 4.5 star rating. I had a winner. 
I just finished adding a touch of salt & pepper and already this soup tastes amazing. Honestly, I have never had a recipe that called for tarragon and I can definitely taste the flavor and like it. Not to mention the 3TBS of cilantro which my BF is also crazy for. I followed this recipe exact to what is given didn't add/substitute one thing. It's a great recipe and I am definitely going to have to keep it in the arsenal. Thanks so much :)

I made this recipe as is for dinner last night. My family didn't care for the tarragon flavor very much, so next time i will use dried dill. This soup was rich & creamy... definitely a special occasion soup! I will be posting a reduced-fat version of this in my recipe box soon...Please try it!

This is delicious. I add a carrot or two, shredded, and use milk instead of cream. I don't add cilantro, but do sometimes add fresh chives. I have even replaced half the potato with cauliflower to make it lower carb/lower calorie. If you puree the (cooked) cauliflower and leave the potato chunks, no one will know it's not all potato. Leftovers freeze well.

I have no idea how anyone could not love this soup. Sure it may not be the healthiest soup but nobody's making you eat it all in a single sitting. I was prepared to follow the recipe exactly including making the roux but when I saw that a number of people said pureeing some of the soup gave it enough thickness, I did just that to save some work. And they are right. I also did not add crumbled bacon until the soup was served. It's a wonderful, delicious soup and now I want to use this as a base for chowder!

Tried and did not like it, definitely not "Ultimate" at my house. I found it too thick and too heavy fat wise (bothered my stomach terribly). My husband and daughter (adult) both like potato soup and gave it thumbs down and actually ask me to throw out the leftovers. I make soups weekly and we all like our soups but this one definitely won't get made again!

Ive probably made this soup 20 times...and it's always gone before it can even cool! Most of the time I make it just as the recipe calls for but occasionally I change things up a little.  Tonight I added leeks! Ive found over time that you can skip a lot of the time consuming steps; ie: just mash the potatoes til you have the consistency you want! My family loves this soup and talk about it constantly as their favorite meal I make.  Thanks so much!!

I halved the tarragon and so glad I did, otherwise I would have given this an extra star.  Also, I didn't see the need to thicken this with flour.  After smoothing half the soup with my puree stick, the consistency was perfect.  (this cost an extra star).   This could easily be a 5 star recipe and is definitely a keeper!

Excellent... Toasted Whole Wheat Buns by Oroweat. Hallowed out the top bun and made a circle to place on top of the soup, like an inverted bread bowl.

I only made potato soup once years ago and wasn't happy with it. So since it's icy/snowy out I wanted a good creamy soup for dinner. I found this one and thought-bacon-he's favorite. I decided to make. I used leeks and green onion instead, and omitted the cilantro and other herb. I used parsley, garlic, salt/pepper, chicken stock. Followed the recipe, and used a half carton of cream since I made a large pot. When the recipe called for puree, I used a old fashion potato masher my Ya-Ya had to break up the chunks of potato. I also added shredded Monterrey jack, cheddar cheese when I served. I couldn't stop the "mmmm's" as we ate. It was delicious the best potato soup I have had. Can't wait to take some to the office to share! Wonderful warm soup for a cold wintery weekend! PS-I served w/ homemade twice stuffed potato skins. A little overkill on the starches...but sure was yummy!

DELICIOUS!!!!!  I made this recipe and made a few changes.  I used chopped leeks in place of the onion.  I put chopped celery and leeks in the bacon drippings(1/4) cup and allowed them to cook/sweat, stirring occasionally ( 15 minutes or so) then I added the chopped garlic and let it cook a little longer then added cubed potatoes and let them cook about 5 minutes.  I poured the broth ( 2 cans as I did not have any chicken stock on hand).   I did NOT puree any of the soup; I JUST used a potato masher to mash up the potatoes a little as my family likes chunky soup.  I was hesitant to add the cilantro and tarragon but I DID!!!!  It made the soup 5 *!  You might need to add a little milk as it is VERY THICK!!!!  ENJOY!!!

This was an awesome potato soup.  The whole family loved it.  The only thing I changed was not adding the tarragon as I didn't have it on hand.  I took the potato masher through the soup instead of pureeing half.  It came out the perfect texture and thickness.

Excellent soup. This is the first time I have ever made soup, so I was worried how it was going to turn out. I actually used vegetable broth instead if the stock, but I think next time I will use the stock to see how much better it could be. But even with the broth it came out really good. I added cheddar cheese in the end, and I actually pureed most of the soup because I like thick soups. I actually could have made it even thicker. I highly recommend this soup and will probably add broccoli next time.

This was amazing. Just what I was looking for. We lived on the Oregon Coast all of our lives until recently moving to the Midwest. I have had trouble finding out how to make a good clam chowder base. Add clams to this recipe and you have an authentic clam chowder that can not be beat. And if you don't want clam chowder you can eat this just as the potato soup, it wont let you down. My only suggestion to others trying this recipe is be sure to get your bacon well done, not burnt but a little more crispy than you would normally like otherwise it will be rubbery in your soup. Other than that I can not preach how good this was. Thank you so much for sharing.

Delicious!  I cooked the celery and onion in EVOO and substituted skim milk for the cream, skipped the bacon to save calories.  Absolutely delicious.

Made it exactly as written and we and our guests loved it!  (Oh, had to substitute dried mustard for tarragon, but that was the only change.)

Very good.  I added mashed potatoes that were leftover from last night's dinner as well and didn't puree as much of the soup--just mashed some potato cubes with a fork before adding the cream in.  I didn't have an onion, so I just used some onion powder.

Never made potato soup before but had some alterations to this recipe for our family.  Used Canadian bacon (also chopped) instead of greasy regular bacon ... used 2 Quarts home made chicken stock ... no garlic, tarragon or cilantro added.  Did add one well chopped carrot  and doubled the amount of potatoes ... no salt (we did add a bit at the table.  Changes in the directions ... used small amount of olive oil to onions when saut√©ing them and used hot water, cooked off, to finish them up same with the celery.  Followed directions for cream, flour and butter.  Did not puree but left chunks of potato.  Yummmy ... thin mashed potatoes with plenty of leftovers for sharing with sick friend's family.  Needed to be thinned with more cream or milk after sitting.   ;o)

My family of picky eaters are all sick and I chose this to make for them for dinner and everyone LOVED it! I served it with sliced sweet french bread to dip and soak up the thick creamy soup and for it to be more filling for my big boys. I always double recipes due to large family and we love leftovers for lunch the next day. I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 2 lbs. bacon, 4 stalks celery, 2 lg. white onions, 6 cloves garlic, 16 potatoes, 2 49.5oz. cans chicken broth, 1 cube butter, 1c. flour, 1 quart heavy cream, 3 tsp. dried tarragon, 6 Tblsp. fresh cilantro, salt & pepper to taste. Same directions just more ingredients to feed my army:) Fantastic flavor! Wasn't sure about the cilantro but it fits fantastically. Will make again for sure!

This is an awesome recipe! So full of flavor, Crystal S, how can you say that it has no flavor?!?! Any recipe using a full pound of bacon and a cup of heavy cream, garlic, onion, & chicken stock??? you say it has no flavor? You must have no taste buds! Chicken stock makes a difference too as apposed to broth. using real bacon grease makes a difference too. Absolutely delicious!

Amazing soup! The only change I made was after suateing everything I threw it all in a crockpot, except for the cream and rue, and cooked it all day. I put in the cream mixture at the very end so it wouldn't curdle.

Pretty good, but definitely not the absolutely ultimate potato soup.  Mine was a little less flavorful than I wanted.  I think with some modifications it would be a good recipe.  Not sure why I wasn't "wow"'ed.

Not bad.  I didn't have cilantro and I diced up a hot sausage link instead of bacon.  I also added a carrot.   Very flavorful.

I made this recipe for my family tonight for dinner- it was A M A Z I N G!!!!  I omitted the tarragon, but only because I did not have any and couldn't find it in the grocery store. I rather liked the cilantro in it- gave it a little something special. we sprinkled a little cheese on top, a dab of sour cream and a couple pieces of green onion and served it with slices of crusty french bread, which I think made it perfect :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Made something similar to this, excellent!  Added one can of chicken soup, 1/2 c sour cream, onion, bacon, chicken broth and potatoes. I didn't blend any in the blender, I just used my potato masher and mashed a little and left most in chunks, but it made it creamier and so yummy! It was very good!

This absolutely the best potato soup recipe. I have been searching for a good one for a while and this is the best. Pureeing half of it gives it excellent texture and thickness.

This was sooo delicious! Used red potatoes, bouillon, and half and half. I'm positive there wasn't a difference. I garnished with sharp cheddar and sour cream. Probably the best soup I've ever had.

Wonderful! I omitted tarragon and cooked my onions in butter instead of fat. I also added 1 and a half cups sharp cheddar. Tasted so great even my picky son loved it and asked for seconds!

I have never had potato soup except for out of a can, and honestly I thought it was horrible.  So I decided to try this recipe and I thought it was great and so did my husband.  I did make a few changes.  I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and added some chives with the cilantro and just a pinch of the tarragon leaves.  It was really good.  I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar at the end and garnished my bowl with sour cream.  This recipe takes some work, but taste really well.

This is the only potato soup I make. It does take a little extra effort, but it is sooooo worth it. My family loved it, and still does.  Been making it for several years. The kids are now married with families of their own, and this is a request I get when they come for a visit. Now the DIL's are making it for their families..... Crackers or homemade biscuits make it even better.  I have made it using bouillon cubes even, and it is great. Have also made it with turkey bacon, and it wasn't even noticed by anyone.

To reduce fat & calories, used precooked bacon in package (bacon bits aisle, but NOT bacon bits), saute celery, onion, bacon & garlic in 3 tbl's of light butter. Used fat free half n half in place of heavy cream & used FF chicken broth. Cut the calories & fat by almost half and the flavor was still great! After serving in bowls, topped with green onions and a little 2% ched cheese! (if want thicker soup, use a little corn starch & milk)

I have tried a lot of potato soups on this site and this is by far the best!  The flavor is just exquisite!
I did end up using more chicken broth than called for.  It was kind of an accident because I had homemade broth and didn't realize until later that I had used 10 cups instead of 4.  After reading the reviews though, I would recommend it.  It wasn't super thick.  Just creamy!  
Oh, and use whatever herbs you prefer -- it won't matter, it'll still be good!

A wonderful soup, will definately make again. I didn't use heavy cream but milk and more than suggested. I didn't have tarragon but it didn't seem to matter. A success with this household.

Its all in the name. FANTASTIC!!!! Reccomend this soup hands down. I followed it exactly except for tarragon, as I didnt have and no cillantro, since we dont care for it. 
I cant say it took away from the recipe, since ours turned out amazing. 
But those that have it may want to try it. Either way, this soup is amazing!!!!

I have mixed feelings regarding this recipe.  It is true that this soup is delicious, however the time involved and the constant attention needed during cooking was more than I thought it was worth, not to mention that as another reviewer stated, it also created many dirty dishes. It is a very "heavy" soup and therefore I would recommend using the half & half that other reviewers used instead of the heavy cream. My overall thoughts during the duration of making the soup was, "surely I can find a less time consuming recipe that will be good."  Unless you prefer "gourmet effort" or you need to wildly impress someone.

I made this without the bacon and using half and half instead of cream. I may use milk the next time as it was very creamy. It was a big hit with adults and kids. We sprinkled sharp cheddar over it and it was great!

I tried your recipe tonight for my husband and myself. I changed the servings to the *2* serving size-thinking it would be enough for the two of us...well we liked it so much that I had to go back and make another pot! The only modification I made was, instead of using heavy cream(which I did not have), I used evaporated milk, worked just as good for the thickener.
Thanks for a great recipe! this ones' definately a keeper! :-)

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for this excellent recipe!!  My husband has asked for it again and I just made it 1 week ago.  The effort is definitely worth it!  My daughter, who usually won't eat any kind of soup, asked for seconds!!  I was skeptical about the tarragon and cilantro (mainly because I never use those spices as I don't like them) but OH MY GOSH!!!  This made the dish!!

This is a very good soup.  Only gave 4 stars because I thought it was quite thick.  Easy to thin down with a bit of milk though.  Yummy wintertime meal.  Update:  What was I drinking when I posted first review?  I make this all the time now.  It is NOT to thick.  Easy to adapt to ingredients on hand.  Excellent recipe!

Five stars all the way. My husband wanted me to put in this review, "this is the best potato soup I have ever had." He was wowed by the flavors. Think it will even better today than last night. I keep all the measurements the same and at the end, added a splash of sherry because it seems to go with the tarragon. Also found there was no need to puree as we like chunks of potatoes.  Very good recipe.

This is one of the best, if most fattening, soups I've made.  Thick, rich and packed with flavor, it's the perfect example of wintertime comfort food.  A keeper and new winter staple.

To cut the thickness when re-heating, instead of water, I've used chicken broth and also milk.

I have been searching for a reaaly good potato soup recipe for a long time, this surpasses anything I have tried to date.  My children and husbnad can be difficult to please, but they all loved it.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic was the only alteration I made.  This is a keeper and one to make on a regular basis. Thank you for getting me what I have been looking so long for.

Good soup. However, not a "true" potato flavor for my taste... I make a potato soup using left over mashed potatoes and lots of onion, celery, cream and butter... It's just a plain easy soup with great flavor...and no work at all...

Excellent, flavorful soup!  I didn't have any bacon on hand, so I sauted the celery and onion in olive oil.  I also use corn starch instead of flour.  This soup goes great with buttermilk biscuits!  Have made this soup many times!

This is awesome.  My boyfriend and I tried this recipe about a month ago...since, I've made it 7 times.  We can't get enough of it.  I'm making it for my family for xmas eve.  

The first time we made it, we accidentally cooked the bacon a little too much (ok, it was black!), after making it w/ properly cooked bacon, we decided the more cooked the better.  Adds a little crunch and seems to be more flavorful!! 

A CLASSIC!

This didn't do much for us.  There was something in it we didn't care for (tarragon?) and my husband really tasted the flour and thought it tasted doughy.  Won't make this again.

This was labor intensive but fairly tasty.  It had a nice color, not the anemic color you would expect with a potato soup.  The color or course is due to cooking the soup in the same pot that you browned the bacon it.  The color was rich and the flavor was nice.  I omitted the tarragon and cilantro.  I garnished with thinly sliced green onion and crumbled bacon.  I served it with hot, crusty French bread.  It was quite tasty.  I found the "8 potatoes" ingredient listing a little vague.  I actully used a 5# bag of potatoes and 3 cans of chicken stock.  I used half the bacon and less than 1/4 c. bacon drippings, which may account for me needing to add salt.  I also added a little red pepper for zip.  I will make this recipe again.  My husband cleaned his bowl with his French bread!

Excellent soup! I wasn't going to puree 1/2 the soup because it looked so good as is, but I did, and it made the soup so rich and creamy. Next time I'll make at least twice the amount. It was an instant hit!

Fairly easy recipe to make.  I thought it was a little too smokey flavored from the bacon grease.  I think next time I'll use butter instead of the grease.  I also shredded some carrots and added for color.

This is the first potato soup recipe we attempted at home, it is very tasty, we used 2 cans of regular chicken broth and 1/2 can of roasted garlic broth and 10 cloves of garlic opposed to 3 on the recipe. It was very tasty! and we will make it again! Thanks!

A little too greasy for me, my husband loved it, the kids didn't.  Seems to be a matter of personal taste.  If I made it again I would not use the bacon grease.

The title suits the recipe!!!  Not only was this easy and cooks up so quick, it has tons of flavor.  I used 2% milk.. thats all I had and didn't use celery... was out of that too and it was great!!  It was nice and thick and didn't lack any flavor!!!  This is a must try.

I always make Potato Soup; it's a staple in our family.  My husband often requests I add ham or bacon to my soup, which I sometimes do, and that prompted me to try this one.  I used half and half instead of the cream, and only used half the bacon that was called for, since I am not a meat lover.  It was fantastic!  My husband requested I make this one from now on, and suggested throwing away the old recipe.  It didn't take much more preparation than any regular soup, either.  I will definately make this again and again.

Incredible!  My family loved it!  The kids have been requesting nothing else.  I cut the bacon down to 1/2 pound.  Marvelous flavor and very filling.  A real winner!

Absolutely amazing soup. I cooked the celery, onions and garlic in butter rather than the back on grease. I didn't want the whole soup to taste like bacon. I also fried the back on first than added it as a garnish or topping at the end so it maintained the crumbly crunchiness for the extra texture. I also didn't food process or mash any of the potatoes at the end. It was much better if a texture without that.

I made this recipe and realized at first taste "This isn't my mother's potato soup!"  Excellent and flavorful - I feel like it has a very sophisticated taste that would be a hit for parties and events!  On the "home-cookin' side - my son (who never tasted potato soup before) loved it!  I'm not sure about the person who said it had no taste - perhaps they left out the bacon or spices?  I thought it was quite beautiful and yummy :)  I kept mine a bit thin without thickening it and it was almost gone before I could get a picture!  Thank you for posting the recipe and sharing!

I make this soup (freezes well if you're making extra) all the time for my boyfriend and I! I use gold russet potatoes with the skin on for texture on those that don't get blended, I find it also cut down the cooking time. I also doubled the garlic and tarragon portion since we love lots of flavor! I also prefer ham chunks vs bacon. I used leftover ham from Christmas and it was mouth watering. Also a great way to use up leftovers!

This is the best potato soup I have had and it is flexible enough to adjust to your taste. I have made it 4 times and every time it's been  a hit with family and company.  

I have made it without cilantro and terragon and it's still good. I add a little whole milk to stretch volume if someone extra shows up.

 I prefer to reserve half the bacon, crumble and add just before serving. This has some crunch as opposed to soggy bacon cooked in the soup itself. You may add grated cheese (or not) to serve.

 It is wonderful, versatile and very amenable to slight modifications. Don't cut the simmering time short (and don't turn heat too high). It tastes so much better if it can simmer for a good 40 minutes or so. Yum.

Spare the flour, ugh! Add a few extra potatoes instead. Seriously do NOT like cilantro so used fresh chopped parsley and/or chives. Lovely.

Variation: For the thickener use some of the bacon grease instead of butter. Add bacon last. Use dill instead of cilantro.

my changes - I didn't use onion but used onion powder...didn't have tarragon, used marjamum instead...used ends and pieces for bacon...added carrots and used 2% milk for the rue...used mexican cheese mix that I already had - parm would have worked too. I did not puree at all.

This was quite bland. I know potato soup is not very exciting but...Toppings of bacon bits green onions and green onions improved it but I felt compelled to add penzey's fox point seasoning to help it.

I wanted to really love this recipe, but I just couldn't.  Well, not without changing the recipe.  What did I dislike?  The prep time, for one thing.  You can achieve as good a result with butter (3-4 Tbsp), as you can with bacon grease.  And there's no cutting up a pound of bacon. Second, I think it was very bland.  I'm no salt addict, but I had to add two teaspoons or so, just to give it some flavor. What did I like? It was very creamy and comforting on a cold night. And, really, 1 C. of cream isn't all that much, considering the soup filled up my pot (a good 4 quarts).  I would change the herbs to something like an Italian seasoning blend, but that's personal preference.  Overall, it's a good base soup recipe.  It just needs more seasoning and flavor.

Numma!  And the next time I make it I will substitute half of the broth with BEER!   I also have a tip for thickening up any soup.  Plain potato flakes, yes folks, really!  Simply sprinkle slowly and stir until desired consistency!  I use flakes for any creamy soup that I want to add substance to.

Yuuuummm!  I have made similar, very similar since I was a kid and I did not know what cilantro was..... no joke (to me it was only coriander)... but it is a good soup.  If you want more seasoning, do you 'thing', but it is a great soup.

Seemed like it was missing something and the tarragon was a little over whelming.  Couldn't put my finger on it but just wasn't the restaurant recipe I was looking for.  I would try it again perhaps without bacon grease and leas or no tarragon.  Added white pepper that helped.

Thanks for the recipe! This is my 1st making a potato soup and this came up great! Cooking time 1h15mn. Thats included preparation time. I added 2 carrots and i made sure that the potatoes are soft before i added the stock which speed up the cooking time. Thanks!!!

OMG, delicious! I made this today with left over mashed potatoes, subbed a leek for an onion and half and half cream to save on some cal/fat. I used parsley in place of cilantro (had none :) It is fantastic, so tasty!
I started this soup at 1120hrs and served it up at 1200......pretty fast and easy esp with the mashed potatoes. 5 stars!

This recipe had too much of a strong fragrency spicy taste and smell.  When my husband came home he said what is that smell and I knew he smelled the tarragon that I smelled and we tasted it and that was all we could taste.  So I would omit that.  The next day the soup turned out to do exactly what the other review said it turned into mashed potatoes and was no longer a soup.  My husband suggested after the first night that I never make this again and maybe I will go witht the Kraft bacon potato soup and that only has 11 grams of fat vs 40 some grams of fat.  It was better the second day as mashed potaotoes, but you need antacids if you have stomach issues because there are just too many spices in there.  Was worth trying something new.

I love potato soup, and this one was very good.  I was true to the recipe except for substiting parsley for cilantro, adding more celery for some bite, more tarragon because we love it, and reserving the bacon separately to use at serving time so it didn't become limp.    One thing that surprised me was that the texture was great the first day I made it, but the leftovers turned into what can only be described as a pot of mashed potatoes.  So, in went 16 more ounces of chicken stock.  I did not use more than the recommended amount of flour in the roux, so I can only guess that the potatoes I used were larger than the ones used by the submitter (they were medium size ... not large).  That is one reason why I always prefer when I recipe calls for a number of pounds or cups, rather than just a number of items that can vary so much in size.  Maybe half and half should have been substituted for the heavy cream?  At any rate, I would advise having more chicken stock on hand in case this happens to you.  Thank you, Karena, for the recipe!

If you try it, don't use the beacon grease. My end product was more like beacon grease stew than potato soup.

Love it!  I added about a 1/2 cup of white wine and substituted the cilantro with oregano.  This is fabulous and will probably become a family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The soup was delicious but I question the "ready in 40 minutes".  Took me a lot longer to make it.  I added some cheese when I served it.  Definitely a keeper.

Made this today.It does take longer than stated but worth it.After the potatoes were cooked,I put the soup in a crockpot and used the Dutch oven to make the thickener.I used 2% milk and some Half&Half .I put parsley in too.Using an immersion blender makes this so easy.Sooo,soo good!

Hoooo-leeee cow!  This soup is warmed me up from the inside out and reminded me of the exact soup that my German grandmother used to make!  I have searched near and far for a recipe that would even come close, and this is the one.  Food is medicine, and this is just plain good for the soul.

This was really good.  I substituted because I had no Celery and I had Mushrooms that needed to be used.  The Potatoes I used looked to be Yukons of various shapes and sizes  Maybe I only used 5 or 6.  My stock was Frozen Turkey stock from a thanksgiving Bird
I had maybe 5 mushrooms  and I added  a Chipotle. 
I didn't need any flour because it was thick enough.
 
It would be glorious over egg noodles  Heck a little Sour Cream and you have a potato stroganoff

I made this recipe twice and as written, I give the recipe 3.5-4 stars. It's a good starting point but the taste leaves me wanting more flavor. I modified the soup to increase the garlic to 6 cloves and I also added about 1 tsp of dried basil (alone) and about 2 tsp of Italian seasoning mix (blend of dried basil, oregano, rosemary, marjoram, cilantro, thyme, red pepper flakes). My family and friends loved the soup and I will definitely make the modified version again!

Very good soup, added 2 tsp cayenne pepper to vegetable mixture and it really spiced it up nicely. Used 7 slices thick bacon and 1% milk and it was still very good.

We didn't have tarragon or cilantro. We threw in some parsley hoping it would do something and the soup still tasted really good. I can't wait to try it with the ingredients we missed the first time.

Great Recipe, it was excellent.  Even better the next day when i took it to work with me.  I did not have to puree at the end it was well worth the effort.  Only difference is I used half and half.  Fantastic 
Thank you for the great recipe.

This is the BEST potato soup EVER!  Did not use the entire pound of bacon as I began to feel a heart attack coming on just thinking about all that bacon but was still completely delicious and super AWESOME.  I would mention that i did leave out the cilantro and used parsley instead as I wasn't sure about having the cilantro taste in the soup.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!  Kids even had seconds!

I made this soup last night for my boyfriend and I. I had never made potato soup before, so I was a little worried. I am a very picky eater so I left out the onion, celery, tarragon, and cilantro.The soup was a little thicker than I had anticipated, So next time I will minimize the flour/heavy cream mixture. This soup was awesome and I certainly make this again.

I think the author of this recipe relies on the bacon lard for flavor and it does add a nice element but otherwise the soup was bland.  I added carrots for color and additional spices.  Probably wouldnt make this version again

The taste is great, although the thickness is a bit much. I read alot of the reviews and pictures, seems I am not the first to see that. I would like mine a bit thinner and lighter in color.

Notice in the pics the variations in color and thickness

I am giving this recipe five stars because it was amazing even though I did simplify it.  I was just trying to use up a bag of potatoes before they went bad, but I fell across a staple meal around here!  I didn't have bacon so my soup was baconlesss.  I also left the skin on my potatoes to save time and actually loved it that way.  Even with those changes my husband begged me to make it again!  The whole pot was gone by bedtime. =)

Best potato soup I have ever eaten!  Followed the recipe as is, except I did not make a roux, just mashed up some of the potatos when they were done.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so substituted 1 tsp. dry.  Also, I used half & half instead of cream.

I made this soup for my husband & me on a cold day...It was excellent. I wouldn't recommend adding any salt. The bacon grease and bacon have just the right amount. Very inexpensive and quick to prepare.

I think this recipe really depends on the size and type of potatoes you use. My potatoes were really big so i ended up using twice as much stock and really had to up the seasoning.

This was delicious! I used italian sausage instead of bacon, added onion powder, garlic salt, and sour cream as the last step. It was the best potato soup I've ever had!

Very good base recipe. I added more bacon, and added leeks. The soup was a little thin for my liking so I added a little more butter and flour. Otherwise a great soup. I also suggest to season the cream mixture with salt and pepper.

We loved this recipe. I didn't have any tarragon, so I used marjoram instead. I didn't add the cilantro because my husband doesn't care for it. I was a wonderful soup! I used maple cured bacon which gave the soup a wonderful flavor. Thank you to the author for sharing. We appreciated it and hope to make it again soon.

This was AMAZING!  I made minmal changes. I used 4 cups of h20 with 5 chicken boulion cubes instead of stock. Only about 1/4 lb of bacon instead of the full lb.  I also added a can of sweet corn. Everything else was done perfectly to the recipe.   This will definitely be made again!

This soup is absolutely AMAZING...I made it 3 days ago and there were left overs for about a day. The only thing I would make different is if there was a way of making the bacon seem crispier. I also cooked it all on the stovetop not in a dutch oven, which worked just fine.

I used water and bullion cubes with a little base because I didn't have any stock on hand.  Also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.  Did not use cilantro as I didn't have any.  This turned out really well and will definitely make again.

This was a great soup.  I did lessen the bacon grease used  and kept the bacon out to add on top just because I don't like too much bacon flavor.

This was great!  I had half-and-half so used that rather than heavy cream and 1 tsp. Herbes de Provence as a substitute for the tarragon.  I didn't use the cilantro.  I used 1/2 pound of bacon rather than the whole pound in the soup.  Turned out I didn't need to drain any extra fat away; just right for the vegetables.  For the fam members who might of wanted a garnish, I put out chopped chives and a little extra sauteed bacon.  I'll definitely be making this soup again!

This recipe is great!  I omitted the bacon, simply because a guest that was over doesn't like it.  So I used butter in place of. The guests and the hubs LOVED it.  They all got seconds, and asked for the recipe.  What I loved particularly about this recipe, is that you boiled the cubes and didn't have to use pre-baked potatoes!

Amazing soup, thank you Karena!  My husband is not a fan of soup but he couldn't stop eating this, I had no leftovers!  A few small changes I made were as follows: 1.  We hate cilantro, I omitted it.  2.  I added 8 ounces of whipped cream cheese, softened.  3.  I added 8 ounces of sour cream.  4.  I omitted the roux (flour/butter).  5.  In addition to the onion, I also sauteed 2 leeks (white and light green sections only).

Delicious even without the tarragon and cilantro. I had leftover shredded cheese that I needed to use, so I put in on top of each serving with green onions.

This soup was so delicious! I subbed chicken boullion cubes for the chicken stock, garlic powder for cloves and I didnt have heavy cream so I used 2/3 cup milk mixed with 1/3 cup of butter. It turned out great and the texture was so smooth and creamy after I pureed half of it.

I made this soup tonight with only a little variation- I used haf and half instead of cream, and used gluten-free flour (2 TBLS was plenty).  And I didn't have cilantro so I used fresh parsley.  It turned out perfectly.  We loved the rich velvet flavor.  I'll be making this soup again and again.

Awesome!  Thank you for a perfect, easy to make soup.  What a great meal on a cool, fall day.  Update:  My son is home for Christmas and asked me to make this for him while he was home.  This has become his very favorite meal.  Over the months I have been making this I've realized that mine is too thick so I add an extra cup or two of either cream or milk.  Perfect name for a perfect soup!  Thanks!

This was great.  It is one of those recipes that you can either follow exactly or experiment without too much fear of messing it up.  I used 2% milk instead of cream and this was still plenty rich.    We topped with grated cheddar and this was a main course. Next time I may try adding some velveeta cheese directly to the soup.

I make a lot of soups and chowders during these Colorado winters, and this one was one of my favorites! SUPER GOOD! I left the skin on the potatoes and used whole milk (was out of cream) and everything was THICK and perfect! My DH kept sampling it before dinner. Thanks so much! It's a great soup!

Used more cream then recipe called for and added some carrots.  My partner loved it and said it reminded him of his mother's!  Can't get better than that!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  My mom and I have been looking for a potato soup recipe for a long time.  Thank You so much.  Not only is this easy, but my whole family loved it! The only changes I made were that I added chives instead of tarragon & cilantro, used light cream, and added carrots.  I will be making this one again & again!  Thanks again!!!

Wonderful and so easy! I also added a couple of chopped carrots to the veggies.  Also, I used 2% milk and no butter and flour. I just thickened with an immersible blender when the potatoes were done, leaving it a little chunky.  I also added a couple of cups of shredded sharp cheddar at the end. We enjoyed this with some garlic toast.

This soup is incredible - rich, creamy and utterly delicious. We all loved it. I used butter instead of bacon grease, omitted the bacon, and, since I didn't have cilantro, used 1 T. each of chives and parsley. I can't wait to make it again!

Added chopped leeks instead of onion. This soup is excellent, but I would add less tarragon or skip altogether.

Great soup; thick and filling.
This is the first potato soup recipe that I've made that didn't include cheese, so I was hesitant to try it.  Glad I did.  It was a little thick, so you may want to thin it down some with a little extra broth.

Best ever!!! I used Golden potatoes the second time I made this, which cooked for about 20 minutes. They turned out very tender. I used russet potatoes the first time and they were a little too tough but it was still good.

I originally reviewed this on Jun. 16, 2007.  I have made it many many times since. The flour called for in the recipe is totally unnecessary and in fact is detrimental to the overall quality of the soup.  The naturally occurring starches in the potatoes themselves are more than sufficient to thicken the soup. When using the flour, leftovers or frozen portions will become grainy.  Just leave it out - it is totally unnecessary. The additional butter is no longer needed either. Also, half a pound of bacon is more than sufficient for 8 med size russet potatoes.

This is the recipe that made me stop hating potato soup. I made it for my Dad, and after he had tasted it, he said, "You know, when I was watching you make that, I didn't think it would be worth all the trouble, but it sure is!" DON'T leave out the tarragon or the cilantro - if you do, you just won't know what you're missing! I get Tarragon in a 5 g container from McCormick or Best Buy for .89 to 1.19 - much cheaper than the fancy stuff in the glass bottles. You can also find the tarragon much more affordably from a place like Penzey's, and it has many other uses (such as in seasoning roasted potato wedges).

Finally, the prep time is WAY off.  This soup takes much longer than 10 mins prep time - closer to 20 to 30 minutes. Altogether it takes about an hour to prepare and cook this soup.

I give it 3 stars as-is, but 5 stars if you leave out the flour and just mash up some of the potatoes in the soup instead.

This was great.  I doubled the recipe and used half-and-half instead of heavy cream.  I was making it at my Dad's house a state away and I forgot the tarragon - it was wonderful anyway. Yum.

this soup was really good. I used only half the baccon it called for because that was what i had. i did not have any of the spices i used chives and paprika. my hubbie said it could use more veggies i think it was great the way it was. and mine was not to thick it was like resteront soup.


I put some chopped carrots in it and it tasted great dont blend the carrots with the mixture because it dose not look right add them after you blend the soup and cooked them separate. then just throw the cooked carrots in

Oh my gosh, this soup is so good and flavorful. I made it just as it says to, except I did not puree it. I am not a big fan of mooshed potatoes. It still turned out great. My kids even loved it. I will make this again. It needs NO improvement what so ever.

Absolutely decadent. Recipe turns out perfectly. Instead of putting bacon in during the cooking process, I crumbled the bacon on top for serving...this keeps it crisp.

I made this soup last night for dinner, and my family and I loved it!  The texture turned out just right and the flavoring with the bacon was just yummy!  I have to say, though, that the prep time listed was completely off -- (Prep Time: approx. 10 Minutes. Cook Time: approx. 30 Minutes. Ready in: approx. 40 Minutes.)  I am a big fan of cooking soup and often spend all day in my kitchen making huge batches to freeze and eat all during winter, so when I saw this soup listed as taking 40 minutes I thought "cool, I can make this for dinner on Tuesday night with steak sandwiches!"  Well, I would suggest adding an hour on to the prep time -- just chopping the raw bacon, cooking it, peeling and cutting the potatoes and chopping the cilantro took me 40 minutes -- and I already had chopped onion from Sunday's soup-maiking day and used reconstituted dehydrated minced garlic.  So, by all means, make this soup, it's well worth the effort.  But if you are a working mother and want your family to eat before 8:30 at night, make it on the weekend!

I changed a few things in this recipe. I just boiled the potatos in the chicken broth, not sauteing them. While they cooked I got the other ingredients ready.  Since the potatoes had a longer cooking time, they thickened enough not to need the butter/flour mixture.  I used ¬Ω lb. bacon and ¬Ω lb. smoked link sausage, 2% milk instead of cream, and 1 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese, and 1 cup shredded cheddar. Also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Followed the rest of the recipe, though.  I wanted to trim a few calories, if possible.  I patted the grease from the bacon and sausage and used olive oil to saute. It was a hit with the family. I do plan to try this going strictly by the recipe.

This soup is awesome! I've made it twice.Both times using 1/2 & 1/2.Used russets the first time,just mashed the potatoes right in the pot and did'nt have to thicken at all.It was a little mealy with the russets but I loved it just the same.Tonight I tried it with red potatoes.Though it was very good,I did have to thicken it.Screwed up the flour mix so just added some instant potatoes to thicken.I thought I would prefer a creamier soup but I preferred the texture of the russets and it's less work.Also,I dont bother making broth,just add the water and throw Knorr cubes in the pot.(Don't like the regular boullion cubes,they just seem like salt water).

This was okay.  somewhat boring.  we had a bumper potato crop this year so i've been trying out new potato recipes.  i would probably think better of it if i had never tried "Baked Potato Soup I 
Submitted by:Sherry Haupt" on this site.  I think that's tons better than this one, and easier to make.  

I would recommend you skip this recipe and try "Baked Potato Soup I 
Submitted by:Sherry Haupt"  you'll love it!

Great recipe, however I too had to cut back on the bacon by half. I guess if you really like the taste of bacon you could leave it alone but I only wanted a hint of bacon flavor, not for it to be the dominate flavor. This was my first time using tarragon in potato soup. It was a bit loud, but it wasn't unpleasing. I was suprised at how well it complimented the soup. I used fresh instead of dry so that may have been the problem. Going to have to play with this one until I find the right amout for my taste. But overall this recipe is fantastic.

This was a terrific soup!  I thought it was fairly easy to make and with a great payoff, the soup.  I've made it twice now.  Once with tarragon and cilantro and another time with tumeric and no cilantro.  Both versions were great.  My whole family loved the soup.  By the way, I did not use cream, instead I used 2% milk and it was great.  I'll make this again and again.

I LOVED this soup. To make it less fattening, I substituted the heavy cream with half and half and didn't have any tarragon, but didn't seem to miss it. Over all, it was very filling, yummy and I WILL make it again.

This is comfort food.  The second time I made it, I was on a mission to cut some of the fat.  I used only half the bacon and bacon grease and used low fat milk in place of the cream.  Still wonderful--we actually liked it better this way.

I made this for a party and everyone said it was very good.  the only changes I made was to hold the bacon out until the soup was served and this left the bacon crunchy and salty instead of mushy and bland.  I used half-n-half instead of cream also and that was fine too. My husband says this recipe is a keeper.

As you've probably seen, this soup already has TONNES of 5 star reviews, but I don't care!  I must add my own 5 star review.  This soup definitly deserves to be on the hall of fame~  it is sooo good.  however, I did use less salt because the bacon were quite salty.  I didn't puree the soup this time but will do next time because I think I'll give it a nicer consistency.  but overall, this soup is SUPER!

I did make some changes and it turned out fabulous, so I don't really know exactly how it would have turned out if I had followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked the bacon, onions and celery as it says.  I cooked the potatoes separately in a pot with canned chicken broth, then added my sauteed onion and celery.  After that had cooked for a while, I added a box of frozen peas & carrots and frozen corn.  At the very end, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and the bacon.  Served with grated cheese on top.  It is delicious!  I didn't add the seasonings because the chicken broth was seasoned already.  I will definately make my version again!

I have to agree with everyone else - this is a wonderful soup!  So incredibly rich.  I added some corn (just cause I like it), eased up on the tarragon and didn't puree any of the soup.  I thought it was plenty thick enough.  My husband and stepson both said this is a soup we have to have often.  Quite a compliment from these guys.  It was a little time-consuming, but worth it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This really is the ultimate potato soup-thank you for sharing.  The only thing that I do different is I only use about half a package of bacon and it still seems to have a great flavor.

Absolutely amazing!!  I loved the thickness, but the next day I had to add water to it because it was really thick, like mashed potatoes.  I added quite a bit of salt because of the potato\flour, therefore I may cut the flour down next time, but it is a great soup.  I served it with sprinkled with shredded sharp cheddar on top.  My search for potato soup is over, thanks Karena!!

Substituted evap milk for heavy cream, used leftover baked potatoes, and reserved herbs for the last minute, but it was very good.  Next time, I'll reserve at least half the bacon for the end, too.  Very good soup.  Definitely a keeper.

This was ok. Save the bacon for a topping. I also topped it with cheddar cheese. I thought the seasonings were overpowering, I put half what the  recipe called for and still thought it was too strong.

This is truly the best potato soup I've ever eaten.  I didn't puree the soup as directed, nor did I add the cilantro (don't like it), but it still turned out marvelous.  Don't be afraid of the tarragon...it's great!

Leave out the tarragon??? Good God.. What are people thinking?  That gives it the wonderful flavor! (but I'm biased... that is my most favorite herb)  I left out the flour (who would have thunk? and just pureed for a creamy soup) This is awesome....... love it, can't get enough of it!  Thank you for posting!

So good.  I did not like the bacon in the soup; the bacon's texture changed during the second cooking.  Next time, I will wait to add the bacon until the end, as a garnish.  

So good.  This is the best potato soup I've had...including my favorite version at a restaurant. Thank you for sharing with us Karena.

This soup was very yummy. I kept a few of the bacon bits out to sprinkle on top along with some cheddar cheese and chopped green onions. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. This is definitely on my list of things to make on a chilly winter night!

An exceptionally easy, tasty potato soup. I made some modifications, otherwise it would get 5 stars. I don't eat meat, so I left out the bacon drippings. I cut the amount of butter WAY back, used some olive oil for part of the fat I did keep, and used fat free half and half instead of the cream to make a lighter, healthier soup. For those who said the soup was too thick, the solution is painfully simple- just puree a smaller amount of the soup, say 1/4 of the soup rather than 1/2.  This froze well and we enjoyed it for a couple weeks after I made it.

Absolute the best I've every tasted or made.  I thickened the broth a little more like some of the others suggested but otherwise, the recipe is right on the money.  Scaled it for 25 people but probably could have made twice that even....they clamoured for it over and over.  Now I'll have to make it a monthly menu item.  Well worth the time!

I was looking for a soup recipe and when i saw this with so many reviews how can you pass it up. While it does take more prep time than stated it is worth it. Being a veg. i used olive oil instead of bacon grease and veg broth, my husband who is not veg. loved it. thanks

This was my first attempt at potato soup and I was disappointed with the results.  Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this dish looked like lumpy mashed potatoes.  The taste was okay but definitely not worth the work or the mess.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

What a flavorful potato soup.  The bacon is a great addition.My family loved it.  I used half and half in place of cream.  I will double the recipe next time and freeze the extra.A must try!

This is the Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup!!  We loved this soup.  I loved potato soup as I was growing up, my aunt always made the best.  Now I have finally found a soup that is even better than my Aunt's, and easy to make.  I calls for more ingredients, and takes a little longer, but it is definitly worth it.

We just made this soup tonight!! It was absolutely delicious, the flavors are just amazing! I did substitute chives and dill for the cilantro and tarragon and we just love it! We topped it with some shredded cheese. This will definitely be a new favorite!!

Good!  I did not have heavy  cream....substituted with creamy protein vegetable broth.....and did not have cilantro to my disappointment. This would have made it even better. To cut down on fat the protein vegetable broth is probably a good substitute. It is made with soymilk and vegetable broth.

The flavor is amazing.  Next time I will be keeping the cooked bacon out and using it as a topping to mix in while eating.  Adding the bacon into the soup at the stage it says to, rehydrates the bacon, making any fat bits a blubber mess.  I ate around the bacon pieces this time but will remember that change next time.  Will make again for sure.  I also used dried cilantro since I did not have fresh.  Still really good!

This was one of those ‚Äúuse what I have on hand‚Äù recipes, so I made a few substitutions: diced green pepper instead of celery, chicken broth instead of stock, rosemary instead of cilantro (plus I hate cilantro).  So good!  I followed others‚Äô advice and added crumbled bacon after adding the potato pur√©e. I suggest garnishing with scallions and shredded cheddar cheese. Perfect for a wintry day.

I made it according to the recipe and it was TERRIBLE.  I'm not sure if it was the bacon grease or what, but my whole family couldn't eat it.  It ended up being a waste of food for our household.

I‚Äôve been making this soup for a number of years. Just never got a chance to review. It‚Äôs fantastic! But instead of cilantro I put in fresh cut parsley. Also the rue I don‚Äôt make. I eyeball milk and powered Idaho potato mix till it‚Äôs the right consistency for me. I even add butter. Great soup for when it‚Äôs a cold night but also if you don‚Äôt feel well and want something comforting.

This is definitely a "make again"!  I did simplify it a little by using a potato masher right in the pot and mashing half the potatoes, instead of dirtying the blender. Also, to emphasize the "ultimate", I added shredded cheddar cheese at the end.

Made as is, we had no cilantro, and it was delicious just made and even better the next day.  This is my new potatoe soup go to from now on. It's just us two so I will see how it freezes will update when we try it the next cold day we have a potatoe soup craving. I did not puree just use the potatoe masher that was handy  couple of mashes is all that is needed if you over do it you will  get a glue like consistancy.

Phenomenal soup!   Two Notes:   First, be sure to use stock and  not broth.   Broth is made with a lot of meat and stock is made with more bones, and bones release gelatin which increases the liquid's richness.   It makes a world of difference!    Stock stock stock, that's the way to go.      Second, modify the bacon.  Instead of returning it to the dish in Step 2, add it back to the soup at the very end.    Flavor isn't enhanced, but the texture is superior, in my opinion.   By adding it back at the end, the bacon is crisp instead of limp.

I made it once just like the recipe said and felt that the bacon was too overpowering and the rest of the soup was bland. I just made it a second time with a couple changes: decreased the bacon by 1/3, added cream of chicken soup+ 1/2 cup water, and did half sweet potatoes. I didn't have tarragon so I added fresh basil instead.  My husband suggested that it could have used some chives as well. All in all this recipe is a good base for preference.

My daughter and I love potato soup, so we are always looking for new recipes.  This one is a keeper.  I made this in my pressure cooker (electric).  I did not use the bacon (we are more vegetarian) so I sauteed the onion and celery in 3T butter (on brown in my pressure cooker), then added the broth and red potatoes.  While this was cooking, I made the rue without tarragon and cilantro.  Once done, I added corn then mashed some of the pototoes.  We made homemade croutons, added black pepper and dome DILL for freshness.  Topped with shredded cheese and gobbled this up.  I am going to make this for my soup exchange and may add the bacon on the side if people want to add this themselves.

Since I made this without the onion, cilantro  and celery (husband dislikes all), I don't know how valid my review is, but we loved this soup!  It was the perfect meal for a cold winter's evening, and I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks for a winner!

LOVE this recipe. But you definitely do not want to skimp on the bacon. For me, that's the best part of the whole soup. Make sure the potatoes aren't too small either, I find that the bigger the size of the potatoes, the better. Also, I add a little bit of crushed red pepper to give it a little kick, and it turns out amazing every time.

I followed the recipe exactly and here's what I found; there are far too many potatoes. It ended up like potatoes with sauce rather than a soup. It was also very bland.

Absolutely delicious.  I made it with only one change.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 since I didn't have cream.  I put the bacon into the soup, not on top as some have suggested and it was just fine.  I did garnish with some shredded cheddar.   I'm on a mission to only make recipes that are 5 star worthy and this one is a keeper.

I used chicken broth instead of stock, I used a masher to mash some of the potatoes right in the pan instead of pureeing, I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and I omitted the tarragon and cilantro (didn't have any.) It still tasted awesome! My husband and two boys had seconds! The consistency and taste was perfect. Yes, the prep was a bit of work, but it was worth it.

Great soup! Very flavorful. If you thought this didn't taste good, you were using bad ingredients. I did switch carrots for celery as a personal preference.

My family loves this potato soup, especially on a rainy day.   I make the soup in my pressure cooker.  The only thing I didn't have was tarragon, so I used Italian seasoning instead.  It's what I had on hand.  Great soup!!

Following the recipe given made for an extremely bland, boring soup, even with the bacon.

I tried again, this time adding about a cup of shredded cheddar, some smoked chilli powder, about five more cloves of garlic, some diced mushrooms, and lots of green onions.  

I also skipped the cilantro and went with some fresh rosemary instead. I ended up with something much more hardy, tasty, and comforting than the recipe gave me.

I made this but did a few modifications. I did not have Tarragon but used an Italian seasoning mix instead. The Italian seasoning had Tarragon, dried basil leaves, marjoram, oregano, and rosemary in it. Also, used dried cilantro as I did not have fresh. I used Bacon Salt with a bit of Sea Salt. The last thing I did was not Puree anything as I think the hearty texture looks and taste great.
It came out REALLY GOOD! I believe the different salts were a nice touch!

2/16:  very good.  a few changes.  i used scallions instead of onion and just a little but either one would be fine.  i used 2 slices of bacon only because only 2 of us were having crumbled bacon on top.  i did not mix the bacon in with the soup, i think that wouldn't have been good.  for the roux, i used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup half and half and it was way too thick.  after combining in the soup and pureeing, i had to add 2 cups of boiling water with one chicken cube in it to thin it out.  i used dried cilantro.  needed more flavor at the end so i added dried mustard, cayenne pepper, salt and ground pepper.  alot of each.  then it was very good.  matthew, larry and i all like it with bacon on top and crountons.

This is by far the BEST potato soup Recipe I have ever made!  I did not have tarragon and only had Half &Half rather than heavy cream, but it was still very rich, creamy, and full of flavor.  Had red potatoes on hand, so used them with skin on.  Did not pur√©e...used masher.  My husband is not a soup lover, but has labeled this soup as one of his favorite meals!  You can't go wrong with this one??

I made it and I love it, and it was so good for the snowy weather we had, my daughter had two bowls. That says alot, because she is such a picky eater. I top it with fresh chop green onions,fresh chop cilantro and shreded mild cheddar cheese. It was delish. Thank you.

Very tasty, but I would say it takes 45 minutes to an hour to make. I like bacon crispy especially when it needs to be crumbled. Since I needed to pur√©e the potato mixture (in several batches due to blender capacity), I didn't add the bacon until I was done with that. Also, the cream mixture doesn't need to be started until you're close to done pureeing. I didn't have tarragon, so I used dill and loved it! Garnish with some shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.

The soup takes an hour plus to make but is worth the effort. I put some bacon in when I cooked the potatoes and reserved some for garnish. I shipped the pur√©e step which really isn't necessary unless of course you like to be able to drink your soup. I used red potatoes which are small and they cook relatively fast so if you desire, you can break them up with a wooden spoon. I did make the roux which added the thickness. The day I made it we were getting pounded by snow (expecting 6 inches) so this is perfect for that kind of day!

Great flavor! I made this today, in part because the weather is cold and snowy in Kentucky. It was a big hit. I did add a little extra garlic, because both me and my husband like it. And I added one TBSP of organic chicken base, which I recommend. I didn't need to blend it at the end; the texture was perfect.

This soup was well worth the little extra effort!  I didn't have tarragon but added everything as directed ... well, almost. Instead of pur√©e-ing I used a potato masher and added the bacon right before serving.   Very good!

Great Recipe for potato soup - used a couple of handfuls of a couple different kinds of cheese and also added some cauliflower to my last potato soup experiment.
I make a huge pot of it and just keep throwing stuff in.
My neighbor says its "like having a party in your mouth"
Love that Chef John

Oh my goodness! This soup really warms your soul on a cold winter's evening. What a crowd-pleaser! I saved some bacon bits to sprinkle on top of the soup before serving, along with some chopped chives I happen to have on hand. Everyone asked for seconds!

I followed recipe but I omitted the bacon, tarragon & cilantro. I'm a picky eater. BUT  this soup is wonderful!! I've never posted before either but this recipe deserves glory. My pic is the pot of soup with the black spoon. I'm good at making chili but I've not made real soup before. This recipe is easy. I'm  a person who has to follow recipes, lol. My adult daughter in IN ( I'm in TN) found this & made it. It sounded so good I had to try it. It's resturant quality. Oh. Since I didn't use bacon I used EVOO to saut√© with. I just read that I could had used butter.

Soup was all right the first time I made it, but had way too much cilantro/taragon for my family's tastes and the bacon came out mushy. The second time I made it with 1/4 TSP of cilantro, taragon, oregano, and basil... 1/2 tsp of pepper and salt, mixed them in while the garlic was simmering along with 1/2 cup of butter. I also didn't add in the bacon until the very last step the second time around, and the soup came out much better. Family loved the edited version.

Yum! This is definitely a good potato soup base to build on. I found it to be quite flavorful as written, although I didn't have tarragon so substituted a mix of fennel seed, ground marjoram, rosemary, and oregano. I also added carrots to the veggies, and I used an immersion blender (love that thing!) to blend it without mess. I did need more than 1 cup of liquid to make the cream sauce. I used 1 cup heavy cream and the roux was still very solid, so I thinned with milk (prob another 1/2 cup) until it was a nice sauce. And it only took me about 1 hr start to finish, even with chopping veggies.

I just throw all the ingredients in the pot and simmer for an hour-ish, reserving the flour until the end, use just enough to thicken, then a few pokes with the potato masher to mash a few of the potatoes. I can't tell a difference in the end result doing it this way rather than saut√©ing and all that. I omit the tarragon as I don't care for it,  only use cilantro when I have it on hand, and I brown and serve the bacon on the side as a garnish.  I know the rating police will hate a review of a recipe I didn't explicitly follow directions on, but oh well. Cooking entails experimentation - get over it.

Great base recipe, however I made a few simple changes. I made the bacon, but didn't use as directed in the first step of the recipe I set aside and added later. I combined the celery, onion and garlic in a pot and cooked for 3-4 minutes then added the potatoes and chicken stock and allowed to cook until the potatoes were tender. In the next step I combined the butter, flour, heavy whipping cream and substituted the tarragon and cilantro with 1 1/2 TSP of Rosemary then combined it with the potato mixture. No need to puree the potatoes just a few simple passes with the potato masher worked just fine. I then added in the bacon to the mixture and allowed to simmer for another 5 minutes. Before the last 3 minutes of simmering I added 3/4 jar of Cheese Whiz and 1/2 cup of Sharp Cheddar cheese (shredded). My husband and 2 very picky boys LOVED IT!

This is the best potato soup recipe I've made.  Followed the recipe as written but added white pepper and salt , and I also added a little more heavy cream to the flour mixture.  Great comfort food!

Believe it or not, I veganized this recipe and it was amazing! I used Earth Balance butter and subbed in cashew cream for the heavy cream; and of course omitted the bacon. So delicious and easy to make! I sprinkled finely chopped chives on top before serving. Wow!

Just made this recipe for the 2nd time, but this time I was making it for my daughter who has celiac disease so needed to make it gluten free. I simply substituted a GF all-purpose flour blend for the required flour, and it turned out great! Smooth, creamy, rich...delicious! Add a little shredded cheese when serving--fantastic!! This will be a staple this Fall/Winter!

I added thyme and salt and pepper instead of cilantro and tarragon.  Also I omitted chicken stock and cooked potatoes and onion with just enough water to barely cover potatoes.  Let them cook until tender and no need to puree or add flour, still lumpy and great.  Just before serving add butter and crumbly bacon.  I also browned a little ground sausage and added that.  It's a favorite with friends and family.  A meal indeed with warm crusty bread.

Great recipe though I tweaked it a bit on multiple repeats.  
Cook as above saving a few slices of bacon raw. Once cooked bacon is removed add raw bacon to soup for added bacon flavor. Do not return the crisped bacon to the pan until the soup is finished.
-To reduce fat, evaporated milk works well instead of cream. Liquid smoke can be used for 'bacon' flavor without the fat. Saute in coconut or other vegetable/olive oil for a healthier alternative. 
-To make this meat and dairy free,saute in coconut oil, substitute one can coconut milk and 2 tsp. coriander seed and dash of cayenne instead of smoky flavor.

I make a similar soup to this. I add celery leaves along with the celery stalks and I add chopped broccoli. Replace the heavy cream with sour cream and it adds a nice tang to the soup. Serve with small cubes of cheese or purchased cheese crumbles. A family favorite for years.

Delish! Loved it! Tarragon and cilantro make it so unique! I made the following healthy changes...turkey bacon. Canola oil to cook onions in. Instead of a butter {fat} based rue I poured the half n half into the stock pot then after cooking stirred in instant mashed potato until it was as thick as I wanted it to be.

This recipe was KILLER GOOD!!! I followed it exactly as written and it was perfect! I would not change a thing.

By itself it would be rather plain so I put two recipes together using this one and another I found on pinterest. I decided to add 1 cup half and half and 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. I did this in place of their "heavy cream mixture". Otherwise everything was a great base to make the soup with, I did not puree my potatoes I like mine to be chunks and I also added shredded cheese!

I gave this 5 stars because I had to make some changes (my son can't have milk or soy). It was SO good, but with my changes, probably a 4-4.5 star. I'm sure that, as written, it's so much better. I didn't have bacon, so replaced the bacon & butter with coconut oil, and the cream with coconut milk.

Even still it was SO delicious. My husband commented that it would make a fabulous base for chowder. When we re-heated the leftovers the next day we added a bunch of frozen corn and that was a nice addition.

Great. Had to make some subs because I didn't have some. Didn't use cilantro, used thyme in place of tarragon, had to use 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup 2%milk in place of heavy cream, did not add boil bacon, added bacon and shredded,mild cheddar as topping.

Excellent basic recipe, which you can easily adjust for quantity, taste and calorie count. Homemade chicken stock will provide a different, possibly more concentrated flavor. I nixed the cilantro and added more fresh garlic, plus a few more personal choices (fat free evaporated milk, fresh cracked pepper, etc.) and served with warm whole wheat bread, garlic butter with shredded cheese (sharp cheddar)& minced green onion available. Tweak away... they will gobble it up! Oh, I dropped a star for overall prep time and IMO avoidable calorie/bad fat count.

I would have to add shredded cheese to an "Ultimate" potato soup.  Only thing I would change though about this recipe is the addition of the bacon during cooking.  After making this soup, I felt a little let down by the texture of the bacon.  My personal preference would be to complete the soup, then add the bacon and cheese at serving.

A truly delicious recipe! I used only 1/2 and onion and added some chopped carrots as well. Make sure the celery, onions and carrots saut√© in the bacon grease for awhile. The soup is very thick. :-)

Loved this! It made enough for a dinner and lunch for my fiance and I. Definitely not "waistline friendly," but that's what makes it so good - rich and filling. Hit the spot (and then some) on a -15c day. Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe with very minimal tweeks of my own. I got Chicken Stock @ Walmart (32oz box)..I purchased those small Klondike gourmet potatos but really to peel was hard so small. I used bigger yellow ukon potatos peeled diced small. Definately puree in blender but on 8serving size I had to twopart it..pulsed puree soup then the cream mix. End result smell and taate at 1st I felt not enough flavor.? Oh..other thing.I didn't out all the cooked chopped bacon in¬†the "simmer"..I put half and reserved rest like another reviewer said!! I served my bowl and I chopped up more freshcilantro and fresh green chive! Crumbled bacon on top..pinch or two of shredded cheese and finally some diced up Jalapenos! Omg...topping definitely made it better! Was very thick and creamy. Peefect for when artic blast comes or just pmsing abd hungry for comfort food!!

I agree with MAGGIEOK2, this definitely took a lot longer than expected. Prep took more like 30-45 min, maybe I'm just really slow but I didn't expect all that work. Definitely add some sea salt, I used no salt stock which didn't help things. The only complaint is that it could've used a bit more flavour. Other than that we enjoyed it :)

At last a delicious easy soup thAt tastes like I spent hours on it. The only difference I decided was to add sage. The flavors melded together and t was delicious. I made it in the Dutch oven then transferred to the crock pot to eat when we returned from . Going to be the perfect end to a cold cold day.

This turned out perfect cooked the recipe as stayed and added a little salt and pepper near the end.  My son tasted it and fell on the floor, said he'd died and gone to heaven.

I'm learning to cook and Allrecipes is TOTALLY helping me save $ for my family of 5. Made this soup Halloween night with Paninis to ward off stomach aches and it was tasty. I found myself adding more butter, salt and pepper (like flavoring a baked potatoe) and I'll play with the consistency next time too. True to other comments it was WAY better after sitting in the fridge a couple days, I'll try to make ahead for Saturday afternoon next time.

I thought this was a great potato soup.  Started everything at 5:15 & was ready by 7.  I did make a couple alterations.  I used Canadian bacon instead of bacon and i used 2% milk with Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream.  I didn't have any tarragon so i used thyme.  It was fabulous.  I also added some frozen corn and peas.

I've been making this recipe for several years and decided it was time to review it. Obviously, it's become a staple in my household. It's a very forgiving recipe as I sometimes don't use the whole pound of bacon and I never add the tarragon or cilantro as I have family members who aren't fond of either. I substitute with fresh parsley. I will use celery seed - sauteing them with the onions - if I don't have celery. I find that the celery flavor is important to the dish as a whole. In lieu of flour I have used a tablespoon or so of instant mashed potato flakes to thicken up the soup. We garnish with the bacon, with more parsley, or with shredded cheese. Combined with a grilled cheese or ham sandwich and you've got a perfect dinner for a cold night. In fact, there's a pot of this on my stove right now which prompted me to finally review it. It's excellent!

I made this with two small changes.  I didn't have bacon so I used diced ham.  Also, after the cream mixture came to a simmer I removed from heat & stirred in a cup of shredded cheddar until smooth.  This turned out excellent!

This soup had a good flavor, however, it sure did not need the flour thickener.  It became very thick and was more like mashed potatoes than soup.

Yes, this recipe takes MUCH longer than "ready in 40 minutes" !!!!!!!!! I just made half a batch for the two of us, and it was very thick. I should have added more stock, but it was late in the evening and we needed to eat. I will adjust next time. I also made this in my cast iron, which I won't do again either. Very filling dinner with some fresh baked biscuits. Thanks!

I used this recipe for soup nite at a Veterans club and they couldn't get enough of it.  Though I admit I didn't stick to the recipe totally I added some of my own homemade spice mix, and extra garlic and I didn't puree any of it as it was tender and some of the potato pieces were smaller so they melted away as it cooked.  I love this recipe!!!!!!!

Yummy! I increased butter and flour to 1/3 c each and used 1 3/4 c of half n half so I could add about 1 c shredded 
cheddar cheese. I omitted the cilantro and replaced w/ fresh chopped chives, about 1 1/2 Tablespoons and increased my garlic to 6 cloves. Puree half the soup its well worth it in the creamy dept. I topped our bowls w/ teaspoon sour cream, fresh coarsely chopped green onion and a sprinkle of cheddar. GREAT comfort food!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good soup.  After reading the reviews I can see how the recipe would be bland if broth was used instead of stock.  There is a big flavor difference between them.  I did add more salt and a bit of red pepper flake, and used 1/2 & 1/2 to cut the fat. The amount of salt depends on the stock used.  I did not use flour but thickened the soup with corn starch for my gluten free eaters.  I did not cook with the bacon grease but did top the soup with sharp cheddar and bacon.  I made my kids do the chopping while I was cooking the bacon so it didn't take as long as some suggested.  My family liked it.

I forgot to buy bacon so I made it and used butter instead of bacon fat, and I used leeks instead of onion.  It was amazing! Best potato soup I've ever had.  Thanks so much for the great base!

Made it again tonight, and it's just as good as I remember. I did add the flour to the potatoes and then the chicken stock, and stirred in the tarragon, cilantro and cream after simmering. Also, I only top with bacon instead of cooking it in the soup. Amazing stuff! Great with a nice salad and loaf of bread. ??

Deeeeeelightful!!!!! I added day old garlic mashed potatoes (about 2 cups) and cooked 3 large potatoes instead. Substituted half and half for cream and used Winter Savory instead of Tarragon and Cilantro. Will definitely try again.

This is the most deicious potato soup I have ever had!  I surprised my husband with it one night thinking it would be just an ordinary dinner, but he was blown away and said hinting, "You can make this ANY TIME you like!".  DELICIOUS just the way the recipe is listed!

Same as other negative reviewers... this is a lot of fat and a lot of work for surprisingly little taste. Pales in comparison to the ham and potato soup posted by chef john which is also much less work. Or one of the potato and leek soup recipes... also good.

I made this recipe as written; the only change I made was to use half-n-half instead of heavy cream. I cut the bacon with kitchen shears & cooked in 3 batches while I peeled & chopped the veggies.  Still took THREE times as long as stated until completion! Entirely TOO much bacon. Olive oil would have allowed the veggie flavors to show, rather than be masked by bacon. This was not the "Absolute Ultimate" potato soup for me, sorry. I will stick with my own recipe.

Best loaded potato soup ever.  The celantro adds a nice bright taste.  This is a must try.  Some grated cheddar and this is comfort food for sure.

This recipe is almost identical to my recipe, and it's very good! Just one thought to share: Rather than peeling baked potatoes (time consuming), I just cut mine in half and use a fork to scrap out the meat of the potato. This also gives the soup a more rustic look.

Instead of using flour for thicking I use instant potato flakes.  Starting with 1/4 cup or more as you desire.  I find it increased the potato flavor.  Other than that this is exactly how I have made it for years.  It's the best.

This is almost like my recipe only better!  I always added cheese but it never froze well.  I make a huge batch of all soups.  So I made this and then added cheese when serving.  Very nice and well the best.

This could be renamed OMG Potato Soup!!!  Really, it's that good!  I made it last night according to directions (two exceptions were turkey bacon and half & half, because that's what I had...I'm a big believer in making a new recipe by original directions first time, and then customizing if I desire).  Anyway, it was a big hit.  In fact, my finicky 15 yr. old son said, "Man, that tasted like we were in a restaurant!"  High praise from him!!  It's my new potato soup recipe!

Good soup. Definitely a keeper. I recommend really crisping the bacon as it stews in the chicken stock for some time and loses some of it's lovely color otherwise.

This turned out fantastic.  I stuck pretty close to the recipe, although I added 8 oz Velveeta into the flour and cream, with about a half cup of milk to thin it out. 

Also, I wasn't in a hurry - I like to let soup meld together - but I believe this truly needs longer than 40 mins.

My family heartily enjoyed this with shredded cheese & scallion garnish.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great winter soup.  It has amazing flavor with the cilantro and the tarragon mixed into the white sauce.  As a finishing touch before serving I sprinkled red pepper flakes on top.  

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love this soup! I've made it several times now, and it's always been a huge hit with everyone. In fact, I am making it tonight, but will leave out the bacon (use the bacon grease still) and add a can of cheese soup near the end to make it cheesy potato soup.

Oh yum. Making some homemade breadsticks to go with.

This recipe is delicious!  The only modifications that I made was to use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy whipping cream, I used leeks instead of onion and added carrots.  This was the best soup I've ever made.

This is the best potato soup recipe I have ever made. My alterations are few. I bake the potatoes and then dice them with skin on. The first time I used kielbasa in place of bacon. The second time I used bacon and smoked sausage. My daughter loves it! It will go in our weekly rotation for winter and be served at our annual New Year's Eve party.

When preparing a dish for the first time I always follow the recipe as written, otherwise how can you honestly rate it.  If you change ingredients, it then is not the same recipe. I have never made potato soup until the other day when I made this one (as written) and I was very happy with the outcome.  It is a keeper. It's a great base recipe that you can easily make it to your own taste by changing or adding a few ingredients to your liking.  I will be making it again to share with family and friends.

I tried this tonight and it was absolutely wonderful! I left out the tarragon and cilantro (because some people don't like it) and added more salt at different times during the cooking process. We sprinkled cheese and green onions on it when we were dishing it into our bowls and that added even more taste to an already great recipe.  This is a keeper!

The soup came out a bit pasty.  I don't think I would both blend 1/2 of it AND use a roux..  One or the other would thicken it enough.  I agree with another critique that it lacked flavor.  Needs some adjusting.  But a good base.

By far the best potato soup I have made! Anything with cilantro is a hit in this house. I made very minor adjustment to the flavor by adding shredded cheese, parsley, extra celery, pepper and tarragon. This will definately be my go-to potato soup recipe. Thank you for sharing! xoxo

This is a great base recipe!  Even though I had some doubts about some of the aspects of this soup, I made it exactly how the recipe is written.  Next time, I would do the following: add some carrots (only because I love carrots in soup), omit the tarragon and cilantro (not sure how felt about the flavor of it in the soup) and add some cayenne pepper.  I would also not puree the soup....seemed thick enough on its own and after pureeing, I had to cut the soup down with additional chicken stock.  Still gave it five stars...very yummy!

Phenomenal!!! I made this when my wife was out at work and it was excellent. My kids ate double helpings which is rare. I exchanged the heavy cream for whole milk, bok choy for celery and upped the cilantro and garlic. I would make this again in a hearbeat.

Felt a little under the weather, and googled potato soup.

After reading reviews on this, I left myself about two and a half hours to make this (Just in case), but I did it in about an hour and ten minutes...I read reviews saying it was bland, which I almost agree with. It's delicious, don't get me wrong, it's just missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. 

Also, I used EVOO instead of butter (Go figure, I had an empty box of butter in my fridge so I didn't pick any up at the store) That may have something to do with the lack of flavor...definitely a prominent bacon flavor. 

Felt something was missing, thus the missing star...I will perfect it when I feel better though!

I'm at a loss for words to describe how delicious this potato soup is.  My oldest grandson who is 14 said "Ganny, this is the best!" You mean the best potato soup? "No the best soup I have ever eaten!" Our entire family loved it and are still raving about it.  I'm afraid they're going to ask for it again soon and my only complaint is that it is NOT 10 minute prep time.  With my husband and I both working steadily at the preparation and cooking, it took over two hours to prepare it but it was WELL worth it.  I only wish I could take credit for it.  We fixed it exactly according to the recipe and although I wouldn't change a thing, there are many substitutions and/or additions one could make depending on your tastes or your desire for fewer calories.  But just know that it is GREAT just the way it is written.  The only things we added were a little salt and pepper.  Karena, I hope you have more recipes posted because I'm going looking for them right now.

I lowered the calories but not the taste.
I used turkey bacon instead of pork.
Canola oil instead of bacon grease.
Skm milk instead of heavy cream.
It was a hit even with all the men in my home.

this is a wonderful soup!! since I think chicken stock is kinda plain I added 1,1/2tsp of chicken bouillon, and more bacon, a link of italian sausage and kale, the flavor was just perfect for my own taste, and my family loved it!!!! Thanks Karena for sharing and so sorry for the alterations...

This soup is fantastic.  Didn't change a thing except I didn't puree half the soup.  Just mashed the potatoes with a potato masher a few times.  This soup came out perfect.  Will be making this again.

Excellent.  I wasn't sure whether to use this recipe which used more chicken stock or another that used more milk and cream.  Glad I chose this one.  I did a few shortcuts...I cooked the bacon 1/2 way and then added the veggies as I got them chopped up (although the bacon I use is quite lean so no risk of too much fat). I also used a potato masher at the end rather then taking the time for food processor/mixer and extra clean up.  Still had perfect consistency.  Will make again. Thank you.

They make potato soup at my job. I went to the website to find a recipe to fix at home. The first one I tried contained sour cream. I didn't like it so I tried this one. Lots of work and more time than stated but the results were perfect. Just like I like it. I left out the herbs and added more stock and half and  half as it was very thick. Will try suggested garnishes and add some carrots next time. Didn't need anymore seasoning for me as I don't use very much salt. The bacon gives it flavor and if you're like me you can always tweak it. I used Better than Boullion chicken stock and will try some parsley or chives next time as well.This is a keeper. Add a salad and some hot crusty french bread and you'll think you've died and gone to heaven.

I made this soup yesterday and the flavors were stronger the next day. I omitted the tarragon and cilantro and added thyme leave instead. I did not puree half the mixture. I prefer texture in mine. I also took suggestions from other readers and added shredded cheddar cheese to my individual serving and loved it!    For an added kick, add your favorite seafood to enhance it even more. Perhaps clams or crab!

I Absolutely agree - fabulous soup! I have been searching for years for this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes but just for personal preference.  I don't like tarragon so just went with the cilantro, which I love, plus sea salt and ground pepper.  I also did not puree any of the soup - instead I added 2 cups real  leftover mashed potatoes just after the cream.  I  have always hated the flour taste in most cream soups so I just added the butter after the cream and along with the mashed potatoes it thickened up just fine.  It did not need the roue (flour & butter mixture). Anyway, it was fabulous!  I also have a hint for those who, like me, may not be familiar with all the herbs & spices out there.  I went on google and put in "tarragon taste"  - a site came on and told me what tarragon tastes like - it included licorce  which is a flavor I detest.  So I am glad I checked before I bought some and used it.  If you're not familiar with an herb, check it out before you buy it since it might ruin a recipe for you and also they can be very expensive.  The Internet can be a wonderful helper sometimes.

This is very, very good! I didn't have cilantro on hand so I substituted some basil, parsley & a dash of mint- it was excellent & I'll probably continue to use that modification! I put half of the cooked bacon into with the potatoes to simmer. I pureed about half of the soup and felt it was too thick so I added 1 can of chicken broth- it was nice & creamy and still had nice chunks of potatoes! We crumbled the remaining half of the bacon over our bowls & sprinkled cheese on top... delicious!! I will definitely make this again.

Very good potato soup.  I felt like something with just a bit of spice was missing, but I liked it very much.  We even got my mom to eat some who claims everything tastes "funny" since an aneurysm 3 months ago!

Wonderful!  This is a standard in our home.  The tarragon gives such a nice flavor!  Filling enough to stand on its own...but goes great with a crusty bread and a ceasar salad.  Grated cheddar  takes it over the top!

Great recipe. I used pancetta instead of bacon. Then I used the herbs I had (fresh sage, dried oregano) and it turned out to be very tasty. This was supposed to be lunch for the week, but there is company over now so it won't last long!

Excellent recipe! Let me tell you, it went FAST! I made a triple batch and it fed 21 people total (just my family and the kids friends) with only 5 servings left over (which frreze BEAUTIFULLY btw!). We paired the soup with sandwiches for some, garlic bread or breadsticks for others, and just crackers for the rest of the group. This recipe satisfied people 6yrs to 53yrs old! I have a large family (many kids) and easy and satisfying meals such as this are such a blessing! Thank you so much for sharing... I see this one in my family for many years to come!

I love potato soup and this recipe is just evil.  I made it exactly as written and am forever spoiled.  My husband was ill at the time, and he wouldn't eat much of anything else but he gulped down the soup.  You could dress it up, jazz it up - but as written, it is the epitome of "comfort food."  Simple flavors combine into a rich, thick, cozy kind of soup.  Thanks Tricia.  :)

I used 2% milk instead of cream because that's what I had, and it still worked beautifully. Also, I'm not a fan of the herbs used, so instead, I tried a tbsp of dried thyme added with the chicken stock and it was spectacular. Best potato soup I've ever had. And I found that cheddar cheese was too much, it was fine as is. But maybe next time I'll try some grated parmesan. That could be really good.

SO GOOD!!  I did change it to have half and half instead of the cream because it's what I had and it is WONDERFUL!  Only thing differnt with mine is we're moving so our blender is packed so I used the whisk to break up the potato so it'd be thicker.  This is going in my recipes!

Um...WOW!  Way YUM!   I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe, except the time it takes to prepare.  But a little time investment yields a simply divine soup. To speed up the process a bit, I cooked the bacon in a large electric skillet and then started the vegetables in the dutch oven as soon as I had rendered enough of the bacon fat. The bacon finished cooking at the same time the vegetables were in process.

This soup is terrific. I made it for my family, and served it simply with just some garlic bread. I skipped the step of pureeing half the soup - it sped up the process, and tasted wonderful regardless. I also added mushrooms, but imagine that this recipe just as is would be great.

This was one of the best potato soups I have ever had. I didn't have the terragon so I left it out, it still turned out wonderful. I have to admit it definatly is not figure friendly, but it sure is good. It is great comfort food.

I made this on a night my father happened to be over for dinner. Within days, my father and sisters and mother all seperately asked me for the recipe. Apparently word travels fast! I used good ole 2% instead of cream. I pureed all the vegetables and half the potatoes to hide the vegetables from the picky eaters. This was a HIT! Thanks so much

I LOVED this soup! I didn't use celery and I increased the amount of cream to two cups. I will most definitely make this again!

This is absolutely the best soup ever.  I just got done making this soup, and followed the recipe exaclty except i didnt have the tarragon or cil. It still came out perfect. Also i added 1 tsp of corn starch to 1/4 cup water and added to the soup after it was totally done just because i like a little bit thicker of soup.  A+++++ YUMMY

I wasn't going to try this recipe because of how difficult it seemed and how many ingredients were involved, but it fed everyone and everyone was sad when it was all gone.

I never ate tarragon before so I put it in and I think I messed it up. Don't really like the taste of that herb. This might be better without the tarragon. I guess it's a matter of taste. We don't use that much here in Cajun Country! Sorry....

I halved the recipe and only used 4 slices of bacon. This made just enough grease to saute the veggies and add a light bacon flavor.  I ate two and saved the others to add to the soup. I don't like tarragon and didn't want the taste of cilantro in my soup so I used chives and parsley.  I used red skinned potatoes which I think hold their shape better and they don‚Äôt give the soup a grainy texture.  The recipe turned out very well and comes together quickly.  I had planned on only eating a small cup of the soup but it was so good, I ate two cups.  I decided to add a little shredded cheddar to the second serving.  Delicious!

I thought this recipe was quite good, although not quite what I expected.  It is by far the best soup I've made besides cream of broccoli.  I usually have trouble with the thickening step- I wish there was some way I'd know if I did it right- but it seemed pretty thick after I mashed the soup with my potato masher (pureeing sounded like something that would go terribly wrong).  I really wasn't sure how long to cook the bacon, and since I used leeks instead of onions (milder yet still flavorful for my poor stomach) I wasn't sure how long to let them saute, but I do think it was tasty and my boyfriend weally liked it.  I have a feeling he would be sold on anything with bacon!

Used just a pinch of dried cilantro rather than fresh, and used some Wondra to thicken  a bit more. Served with cheddar cheese. Rave reviews all around!

I made several adjustments to this soup since I am vegetarian, I used a 'no-chicken chicken broth' no bacon, and Silk Coffee creamer plain flavored.  I also used the small golden onions whole to saute and simmer in the soup, I also added carrots and dried shittake mushrooms.  The carrots gave it a slight sweet taste, which was delicious and the mushroom were good as well.  I pureed about 1/3 of it and it worked well.  The flour didn't mix well with the creamer, so I ended up removing it, next time I will either try using soy flour or none at all.

I have looked through many recipes for potato soup, but the name save it all.  This is absolutely the ultimate potato soup.  Don't be tempted to leave anything out.  It all comes together in the end.  My one suggestion for the bacon, is to cut it up in small chunks first with kitchen sheers, and then brown it to a crisp.  When it's time to add it back in, I only add in half, and reserve the other half to spinkle on top when serving, along with shredded cheese and chives.  If you can find chicken stock instead of broth, use it.  It has so much more flavor!  It takes a lot of time to prepare this, but it is so worth it!

My family and I just loved this recipe. I used whipping cream which I'm not sure is the same thing. It turn out great. My daughter loved helping me make this, and it didn't hurt that she loves bacon. I didn't know what tarrigon was, but it tasted really good in the soup.

Made this for a party with baked potato fixings (crumbled bacon, shredded cheese, sour cream, chives) and people loved it.  I served it in a crock pot so it stayed hot the whole time.  Every drop was gone by the end of the night.

This is a great recipe for potato lovers out there. I didn't have bacon lying in my fridge so I sauteed bacon bits in the butter instead. It still worked. I love how I could taste the bacon with the potatoes in every sip.

I added a few chopped carrots in the beginning (saute with celery), and a handful of shredded cheddar at the end. I also substituted milk for the cream and did not blend much of the soup. I only blended a few cups to thicken it a little. Very popular with my entire family.

This soup is a cold weather staple in our house.  Only thing i do differently is leave out the bacon because i don't like the way it gets soggy in the leftovers.  Also I add just a bit of fresh dill instead of cilantro.

This soup is so GOOD!!  I made it for my daughter, SHE'S 13 & VERY picky, so I left out the herbs.  She thought it was YUM! I cut the recipe in half (love that feature on this site!!)  I used half yukon gold & half russet, the yukon melt & the russets were cooked perfectly.  I  used the yukon so I wouldn't have to puree. It worked great!!  Next time I might try it with thick cut pepper bacon & leave 1/2 out for a crunchy garnish.  MMmmm I loved this soup!!

I love this recipe, It is so easy and delicious. I Jst use a potato masher instead of pureeing the soup and it turns out just fine I have added this to my teenagers recipe book so he has it when he moves out.

I have been searching for the potato soup that they serve at "Hops" without success. This recipe comes very close to being as good, and I love the tarragon flavor in it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good, I added 1/2 tsp thyme and only used 1/2 tsp tarragon (wasn't sure about licorice flavored soup). Pureed half like directed, not sure if it really needed it because after that it reminded me of mashed potato soup, but overall good flavor, kind of heavy on the bacon and I only used a little over half a pound. So next time I make it, no pureeing, no bacon in soup, only for garnish. Oh also added a shredded carrot, added color and taste, and no cilantro.

So so so good.  I cannot begin to describe how good this soup was.  
Suprisingly though, it did not reheat very well at all.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half as to not have so many leftovers.

This soup is absolutely awesome!!!!  The flavor is so rich and tastey.  My husband loved it too.  It didn't take too long to make either.  I would definatley serve this to company and make again for us to eat.  I didn't have any celery or tarragon.  I also used 2% milk instead of cream (still very rich in flavour).  I added a little paprika and pepper.  Thank you for entering this recipe.  It is a keeper!!!!

I made this recipe for the office Irish Celebration, it came out great! I substituted some lower fat items, fat free chicken stock and light cream, no one will notice. Also, I just had to add a can of corn.

This soup was excellent and very easy to make! The flavor was incredible! And it only took one pan to make it in, didn't seem like a big mess to me. Reminded me of my mother's homemade soups when i was growing up - good comfort food!

Excellent soup/chowder.  Substituted leeks for onions and garlic, cut bacon in half, added evaporated milk for the cream.  This is just what I had and it was excellent.  I did not puree.  Thanks very much!!!

truthfully this tasted more like bacon soup than potato soup. next time i will definetly add maybe a fourth of the bacon if any. i think the bacon bits on the top thing would probably be enough.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I made it for my daughter who had just had a tonsillectomy and she loved it.  Everyone in the house ate every bit of a huge pot in two days.  I will definitely continue making this for years to come.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Original review 10/25/2005 - This is truly the ultimate potato soup recipe. I will never make another. DO NOT CHANGE A THING when making this soup. It is perfect exactly the way it is. I have made it many times and each time it is gone within a day. I get raves reviews from everyone I've made it for. Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe.

UPDATE 12/31/2015: I can't tell you how many times I've made this awesome soup but every time it turns out thick and delicious. I give it away as gifts and everyone always has great things to say about it.  I have never used cilantro or tarragon because I do not have those things on hand and won't buy them for one recipe, but it so, so good without them so I personally will never add them. Delicious and well worth the prep time!

This recipe is great! I followed recipe exactly.  I do think it took a little longer than 40 total minutes...but worth it.  One suggestion: peel your potatoes before you start...that took longer than I thought.

Very good... I wish this recipe specified what kind and size of potatoes to use. I used red potatoes and since they are less starchy, they got a bit glutenous when I blended the soup. I would also suggest eye-balling the amount of bacon grease you use. I thought 1/4 cup was too much. Another suggestion I have is to try omitting the butter/flour and use Wondra (made by Gold Metal) instead to thicken the cream mixture. Also, I don't see any reason why you couldn't use 2percent or whole milk intead of cream. This was tasty in it's hi-fat form, but would probably be just as good with these changes.

What a wonderful soup! I am vegetarian so I used the butter option, but I have a *secret* - when you finally add the potatoes to the onion mixture, sautee it for about a minute and then add about 1/4 cup of BACOS Bacon Flavored Bits. They are not real bacon, they are a soy substitute. That will add back the bacon flavoring. I did not add cilantro; the tarragon was a brilliant addition I wouldn't normally have thought of. Also I used half and half instead of the heavy cream, and I used my blender to puree half of the soup. I served fresh warm rolls with butter with this soup. HEAVEN!

There's GOT to be a better way to thicken soup. Way too much flour for the amount of soup! 
Didn't like having to puree the soup! Too much time and too many dirty dishes!
Overall, it was almost ok.

The flavor of the soup was very good, but the potatoes were a little gritty.  I think next time I will use Yukon golds, because they seem to have better texture for soup.

This was sooooo good!! Very rich, so I'm not sure how often we'll be making it. We cut down a bit on the bacon (12 oz) and used center cut (less fat).  Everything else we followed to a T and it was just perfect.

I was looking for something a bit like the potato soups I've had in cafes.  This recipe is close to perfection.

As a vegetarian, I left out the bacon and used shredded smoked cheddar as a garnish for extra flavour.  I also ended up using 10 small/medium sized potatos instead of eight.

Will definitely make this again.

This soup was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, my husband loved it and I have given the recipe to all my family to try with a very strong recommendation. I used 2% milk instead of the cream and added one diced carrot with the celery and onion. Also, with a potato smasher instead of puree & only did 1/3 the soup. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  We just got through eating it and my husband is asking when I will make it again!

i made this tonight and thought it was really good. i've made a lot of different potato soup recipes. It was really creamy, perfect for a cold night like tonight! Tarragon gives it a rich flavor (i did cut that by half) and used half the bacon. My boyfriend said it was amazing. don't know if i'd go that far but it was pretty darn good and had great flavor.

Considering the rave reviews and high calories,,I was expecting a much more tasty soup.  It was pretty bland for my husband and I.  I won't be making this again.

I wanted to make potato soup and decided on this recipe because of the high ratings. I have to agree with everyone else, that this is an awesome soup. My family went nuts over the taste and texture. I wanted to leave my feedback, so that this recipe can get the 5 star ratings that it deserves. Thank you op for this awesome recipe.

I frequently use this recipe and it always receives rave reviews.  However, to make this soup a bit healthier, I substitute the bacon for light margarine and use skim milk instead of the heavy cream.  I've never felt that I've missed out on anything using skim milk, but then again, I've never made it with the heavy cream to know otherwise.  And I use 99% fat-free chicken broth.  Also, I've made this recipe with as well as without cilantro and the difference isn't great enough that I would go out of my way to buy any if I don't have any on hand when making this.  With these modifications, I don't need to make these as a "special treat."  I can make this as often as I feel like it!  This is an Excellent recipe!!!

The soup was delicious! But it was brownish, I guess I had visions of cream colored soup.  But that might have been my fault.  I browned the bacon, deglazed the pan with a very small amount of (white) port wine.  When I pureed 1/2 of the soup and added it back in the soup was not cream colored it kinda looked more like a light gravy. Hmmm. But still delicious.  I'm thinking that if I want a cream colored soup :-), I should use smoked ham for the smokey flavor and cook the bacon separetly from the soup and sprinkle crumbled bacon on top?  But however you make it its GOOD!

This recipe surprized me, it is FANTASTIC!  I used fresh Tarragon as well as fresh cilantro.  I love scratch cooking.  Fresh ingrediants make a huge difference.  Thanks for shareing with the rest of the world. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This is an awesome potato soup.  I've made it for several different guests and everyone always wants the recipe.  After making this many times, I've started using just a bit more garlic and a little red pepper for some kick.  One helpful tip:  Don't overcook your bacon--I did this once and it just didn't seem as good.  When it's just starting to crisp, you're ready to go.  Comfort food at it's best!

TASTY! Used precooked bacon, so I didn't have any grease to add.  Followed Submitter's suggestion and added extra butter. I made exactly as stated and then added about 1 cup velveeta to provide a cheesier soup. Didn't have to blend to smooth - cooked long enough that wasn't needed. Excellent, easy to fix soup for a spur-of-the-moment what-can-I-fix dinner! Thanks for the post!

The recipe is good, but I was not prepared for all the prep work. Maybe it was because I was making dinner while helping the kids with homework, snack etc. In addition to the all the prep, the recipe has you make the cream after you get the soup cooking. I should have waited 10-15 minutes before starting that part of the recipe. I had it finished and had to let it sit. I added some of the stock to it when I was ready to add into the soup, it warmed it up and thinned it down. My husband didn‚Äôt like the Tarragon flavor next time I will leave that out, I did not add the cilantro because my family does not like it. I used half and half instead of cream and it worked great.I would wait to put the bacon in, a lot gets blended up and that is my kids favorite part.

This one's a keeper.  I've made it countless times.  I have tweaked it however--I omitted the tarragon and cilantro (didn't have any on hand and thought it sounded strange to add those herbs anyway)  AND I don't put any of the cooked bacon back into the broth to cook with the potatoes.   I simply serve the yummy crunchy bacon on top of each bowl.  Putting it in the broth only renders it soft and less appealing.   Give this one a try!

The only time I make a potato soup recipe is when I have a small bowlfull of left-over mashed potatoes. If you use flour to thicken this soup, this is no longer soup, it's something else - a stew. I use thyme leaves and parsley for flavoring, plus salt and pepper,  but you can use whatever flavorings you like. I put in diced potatoes, raw, a diced carrot, and one can cream of chicken soup (last) along with the chicken broth. Otherwise just follow the recipe as is. I don't use the cream as the mashed potatoes have milk in them if you're watching the calories.

Oh my Gosh!!! This soup was simply wonderful.  I made it for my husband (his favorite soup) and he said it was the best he has ever had!  We just loved it!

Very good and easy to prepare - there really isn't anything exciting about potato soup - I wanted soup - had all the ingredients on hand so I made it. I would make this again.

I used half the bacon called for, and it still turned out to have enough bacon flavor.  I skipped the celery.  It was the best potato soup I've ever had!  My only complaint was that it was not as good as leftovers as I had hoped.    The bacon got soggy and the texture was more greasy the second day.  I would recommend this as a cheap, hearty meal!

I thought this was very good, but I think I would add a little cayenne pepper or some other spice to add a little zip, but I will definitely make again.

Made this a second time with much better results.  Should have followed the recipe correctly the first time!  Added chives instead of tarragon and cilantro, and added sweet corn and grilled sausage.  Wonderfully creamy and satisfying.

Ohhhh Myyyyyy Goooooodddd!!!! I have, for a long time, stayed away from pasta's and potatoes, but this soup is too delicious to ignore!!!  I made this mainly for my hubby who LOVED it.  I, myself, ate 3 bowls! My coworker begged me for the recipe after I gave her the leftover soup to try.  She said she'd rather have this soup than Turkey on Thanksgiving! LOL  A++++ all the way!

Soooo good!  This is a very good recipe.  I did keep the bacon aside, and served it as a garnish.  I thought it might get soggy in the soup.  This is the best potato soup I've made!

Sinfully delicious!  I cheat and use the packaged bacon bits.  It saves time and it tastes the same.  Also, I use dill instead of the tarragon and cilantro (Hubby hates cilantro) and I couldn't imagine it without it!  The best comfort food!

Didn't have any tarragon but tasted great with Italian Seasoning and lots of fresh Cilantro.  My vegetarian friend had a taste ... even she couldn't resist the smell!

Wow!! What a fabulous soup recipe! I followed it exactly, except I did not puree 1/2 of it in the end, I liked it the way it was. This was extremely easy to make, my children and husband loved it. I will definately make this again. Thanks for this recipe Karena.

The taste was wonderful. Mine came out way too thick, about the consistency of mashed potatoes. It made a wonderful side dish. Because mine came out so thick I shaped some into patties and fried them in a little butter. Good Stuff!

Outstanding soup.  On second attempt made the following changes and liked it even better: Used about 1/3 of the bacon to make bacon crumbs to sprinkle on top.  Added 4 Brown'n Serve breakfast sausages sliced in 1/4 inch pieces to the other 2/3 pound bacon in the recipe.  Added cooked bacon/sausage at the end to keep them from getting chewy.  Pureed only 1/3 of the soup (instead of half) - the original recipe was actually too thick.  I can't resist tinkering - Karena's original recipe was great and you may prefer it.

Words can't sufficiently describe how good this soup is. Do yourself a favor & save it for the next snowy or rainy cold day and make sure you have a good roll of german crusty bread or at least a bagette of sourdough and some good croutons. I've made it three times in the last 4 months. It's definitely a Hall of Famer in my book. This is comfort food to the extreme.
Thanks for sharing!

This soup is terrific! However, my body doesn't agree with high fat content. Next time I will cut out as much fat as possible.  Also, the fresh cilantro was a little overpowering. Next time I will try using dried cilantro instead. Thank you for this recipe.

This was an awesome recipie or so my family told me (I am on a diet.) I used only six slices of bacon and substitued evaporated milk for cream and added more normal milk to make the soup go a little farther. It was great!! Though it took longer to make than the recipie said with a substantial amount of prep time it was well worth it. A definate keeper!!

This is the best potato soup ever.  I used half & half and left out the celery & garlic because I don't like either one but it was still great.  Even my very picky son liked it and he never eats soup of any kind. Took me a little longer to make than what it said but no matter, well worth the wait.  Thanks!

I really like this recipe.  The only thing is that my husband said he liked it too, but he said it's a little bit too garlicky.  I love garlic, so I didn't even notice, but if you have people in your family who don't care much for garlic, go easy on that part of the recipe.

I used 1/2 the bacon and sprinked it on top after serving along with some cheddar cheese.  I also used 1/2 cup of half and half and a 1/2 cup of skim milk.  It was delicious even without any added salt and pepper.  My 9 year-old loved it too!

I loved the flavor. It was wonderful and it is full of flavor NOW. I know it will taste better tomorrow but you dont have to wait. I made a few modifications only because it is what I had handy. I used the precooked bacon and threw it in the pan and let it get crunchy then drained. It leaves a little fat in the pan, then I put in the onion and celery and sauted then a little butter and then the garlic and made every thing golden. I dont care for cilantro except for in salsa so I omitted it. I cant tell you how great this is. I chopped the tops of green onions and sprinked on top and then crumbled some of the held back bacon for the top. Then three small shavings of cheese. And Viola.....Dinner is served! Thanks

This one will be a standard now for our family...I served it at a dinner party for 8 (doubled the recipe so that we could freeze the rest) and received rave reviews.  Pureeing 1/2 the soup lends a warm texture.  A few changes: I only used about 1/2 cup cream and the rest whole milk, omitted bacon and used olive oil for base and Healthy Choice Kielbasa.  It was still thick and creamy, but just a touch healthier!! Molto bene!!

And I thought my baked potato soup was special. This is really a great recipe. I emailed it my sister for her to try.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!  I usually have a pasta course on Christmas.  But, I decided to make this soup instead.  Everyone was so disappointed....until they tried the soup!!!  They loved it and even asked for seconds.  My sister wanted the recipe and my father was in heaven.  My FATHER IS VERY PICKY!! It was alot of work but well worth the time......Made it twice so far (was craving it after the holidays!)
Make it....you'll love it.

This was the best potato soup I have ever had.  Wonderful flavor with the bacon and cilantro.  Just the right blend of ingredients.  My hubby is a picky eater, but he asked for seconds on this one!  Excellent soup!!!

Perhaps I did something wrong?.. but this soup was so thick it was more like a runny scalloped potato dish than a soup. I'd attempt to thin it but I don't care for the taste the cilantro brought to it, so it's not worth the effort.

I put everthing in the slow cooker and it came out wonderful. I cooked the bacon and the cream mixture first, then added the rest of the ingredients.  After three hours on low it was already done, I did just like the original recipe and pureed half the soup.  Best  potato soup recipe I've tried yet

Well I am 38 years old and had tried potato soup for the first time about a month ago.  I loved it!  I pulled up the first recipe on the net, which was this one and attempted it.    This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I even cooked a second pot and took it into the office for the more seasoned potato lovers to try.  They have all taken the recipe and are using it.  Thank you for adding taste to life!

I recently made this soup for our Bible Study class.  Everyone loved it to include my husband.  He is basic Chicken Noodle kind of guy so this was a real test.  Prep time is more involved than just cutting up some vegetable and throwing them into a pot to simmer but it is worth the extra time.  I will definitely keep this one to make again and again.

This was wonderful!  We all enjoyed this a lot.  It was just a bit too thick so I thinned it out with some extra chicken broth.  The cilantro is a great taste treat in this soup.  One of our daughters added just a little cheddar cheese to her bowl of soup and said it was a nice addition.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It would be better with less bacon.  This was more like bacon soup with potatoes.

I haven't had potato soup in a long time and was searching for a good recipe.  This one was great, except I skipped adding the flour done in the butter in the third step because after I was finished pureeing the potato mixture, it was already thick enough.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe with half the bacon fat, half the bacon, and 2% milk.  I didn't puree half the soup and it was still quite thick. My husband was talking about another batch by the time the first batch was gone.  He thinks this soup should become a Sunday tradition.  Thanks Karena!  (I've tried it with ham and sausage and we like it best with bacon.)

We loved this soup!  Admittedly it is not for the faint hearted, but such a wonderful treat!  I substituted the bacon with diced ham that I had left over from a baked ham, and, used the ham fat to saute my veggies.  Also, I added some carrots for color and shredded cheese (of choice) for an extra creamy texture.  Just a wonderful base recipe to then personalize to your family's tastes.  Believe me, there were no left overs!

I used this recipe with the extra butter instead of the bacon, I also used 2/3 cup plain rice milk instead of the cream. It was fantastic. I made it last weekend, and I'm making it again today! We love this, it has become a regular on the cold weather menu.

I served this potato soup at a family pot-luck dinner.  Although it took some time to prepare, it was well worth the effort.  Everyone said it was the best they had ever tasted.  Even the kids were scraping the bottom of thier bowls.  I've been asked to make this again next year, and I will.

This is the best potato soup recipe ever!!  I have made this soup at least a dozen times for different occasions and everyone begs for the recipe!!  I don't like the bacon grease, so I use canned, crumbled bacon and instead use olive oil.  I also use half and half instead of the heavy cream, although milk would be fine as this soup is very thick.  One last favorite addition of my fiance's is cheddar cheese!!  Everyone should try this recipe once and they will be hooked!!

this is AWESOME, I've been looking for a good P. soup recipe for a long time and this is it!  Next time we will use bacon bits or OM real bacon bits instead of freshly cooked bacon, it got too soft for our taste.  I used the heavy cream, and it was way creamy, I will try half and half next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe twice to the rave review of my friends.  As I do not like the grease and heavy
flavor associated with regular bacon, I substitute turkey bacon in the recipe.  In place of the grease, I
use a little olive oil.  The taste is wonderful, and the reduced fat content makes you feel a little better 
about eating the soup.  Be careful about over-stirring, as it can break down the potatoes and give the
soup a rather mashed-potato texture.  Enjoy!

I have always hated potatoe soup. It always seemed like potatoes in watery wallpaper paste. However, I happened on this recipe as a newcomer to this site and decided to make it as it even sounded delicious.  I made it exactly like the recipe was given and could not believe how wonderful this is.  It has to be one of the best soups I have ever eaten and my family enjoyed it temendously.  I would definately recommend this to everyone. Thanks so much.

I have made this twice and both times it was fabulous!  Really satisfying.  I also added some 1/2 and 1/2 at the to thin it a little.  Mine came out as thick as mashed potatoes until I thinned it. Well worth it.

An excellent recipe.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I used milk in place of the whipping cream and it was still wonderful.  Garnished with chopped green onion--superb.

This is the potato soup recipe I've been looking for.  I did make a few substitutions out of necessity.  I used a 2.8 oz can of Oscar Meyer bacon pieces (usually found in the salad dressing section of your store) and I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.  Wonderful!  Even my soup hating husband liked it!

I made this soup last weekend for my other half, who wasn't feeling well and wanted some "really good potato soup." I have since had to make 2 more batches! It opened to rave reviews, and after I took a big bowl to my mom's house, the whole family was begging for the recipe!   My NEW FAVORITE!  My own little twist - serve it with Tabasco sauce on the table - it tastes great spicy!

I substituted canned chicken broth for the chicken stock and used skim milk for the heavy whipping cream (didn't feel like running to the store) and it was fantastic.  I had to season quite a bit, but overall an excellent recipe.  Thanks!

I made this and loved it! I used red potatoes that I scrubbed and diced with the skin on. I doubled the celery and added just as much carrots! They fit well into the recipe. I also used precooked bacon bits and added them toward the end, easy and still flavorful. Cheese makes a wonderful add on at the end!

Absolutely AWESOME!!  The title of this recipe is correct.  It is VERY good.  I halved the amount of bacon and used parsley instead of cilantro . . . seriously good.  Absolutely will make this again.

Amazing! This is the best potato soup I have ever made. As some of the other reviewers have said I did not boil the bacon with the soup, but instead used it as a topping afterward to keep it crispy.

Delicious, rich comfort on another gloomy cold day. Even with my substitutions it was 5 stars. I did have bacon fat, but no bacon. I used leftover holiday ham. The bacon fat added wonderful flavor. I didn‚Äôt have fresh cilantro and used dried. I didn‚Äôt have tarragon and threw in some sage. This is really so, so yummy.

We loved it because we hadn‚Äôt had potato soup in quite sometime.  It was yummo as Rachel Ray would say.  We will definitely make again but would add bacon at the end for crunch.

Delicious!  I added some shredded carrots for color.  Next time I will add some corn too.  I can easily see this made with some diced ham too.

This is the BEST potato soup I've ever had! It is rich, so sometimes I'll substitute some of the cream with milk. Either way, it is delicious! I highly recommend this recipe!

I have made this a few time so far and love the recipe more each time.  I have added a few twists for our tastes which compliment the recipe...  doubled the heavy cream, added fresh corn from three ears of fresh sweet corn and cubed ham.  Absolutely delicious.  This one is definitely a keeper and worth sharing with friends.  Serving tonight with slices of garlic cheesy bread.  Definitely awesome.  Thank you.

I‚Äôve made this twice and love it. I don‚Äôt change recipes until after I‚Äôve tested it out. This time I was short some spices. I substituted marjoram for the tarragon and parsley for the cilantro. I also saved back the bacon until I was going to pur√©e some soup in the blender but decided to just use a potato masher. It took about an hour and a half. This was my favorite potato soup

I can't get over how people use chicken stock for everything,  This recipe has no chicken in it, so why use it. People you have to get with it. now days you can make  it yourself   . I have found that (  Better than bullion ) An it comes in beef ,chicken, pork, and garlic.  I use all of them , an I think they are great. Just use one teaspoon per 8 oz of hot water.

I added more milk so I could include shredded cheese. Didn't use tarragon or cilantro. Topped the soup with chopped scallions. Also through in a cup of sour cream. Delicious! Used white pepper

Really good! I didn't have the stock so I threw in 2 boullion cubes. I also added a can of corn and a brick of cream cheese. I was worried about the Tarragon so I added half the amount and it was good! For sure will make again, thank you!

It was wonderful! I added more cracked pepper and used another cup of the cream instead of pureeing potatoes. I was in a hurry and didn‚Äôt have time to pur√©e. Don‚Äôt skip the tarragon, I used crushed leaves, it added color and flavor. The family loved it.

Prepared as written with the exception it took more liquid than stated. Great soup. Rich, thick texture.   Personally I could do without the bacon but my husband loved it.  :)

I did not care for the flavor of this soup.  Maybe it's the tarragon that seems out of place.  A lot of work and two pots to clean.  I will say I liked the thick nature of the soup.  Will not make again.

I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand. Wasn't going to the store on a cold day to pick up a couple of ingredients, so had to improvise. I didn't have any cream, so used some cream cheese and omitted the flour. I used rosemary instead of tarragon. I didn't add the bacon until the very end because I like it crunchier. I also added some carrots and then at the end, added some shredded cheddar cheese. I just mashed the potatoes with a masher instead of my inversion blender. I also added a bit of better than bouillon to my broth for more flavour. Husband was standing over the stove eating it right out of the pot, with the serving spoon. Needless to say, he loves it, and since I made it for him, that's all that matters.

Turned out delicious! I omitted the tarragon and cilantro.  Cooked about 6 thick slices of bacon, garlic, onions, and celery together.  Then added chopped potatoes until slightly browned. Added a couple dashes of onion powder, black pepper,  and salt. Put all into 4 cups of chicken broth. Whisked butter with flour added heavy whipping cream until thickened. Added to potato soup and wahala.  Master piece. It is bacon potato soup.

This was pretty good. I'll make some changes next time, though.
  
First, the onions and celery were a bit overpowering.  The bacon helped to balance out the onions and it wouldn't hurt to have even more bacon.  Next time I will make sure to caramelise the onions, roast the garlic, and try adding less celery.  Also, "8 potatoes" can vary wildly depending on the size and type of potato.  It would be better if the recipe had a weight measurement of potato.  I needed twice the amount of broth that the recipe called for in order to manage my 8 potatoes.  Overall, this is a good recipe, even though it could use some tweaking depending on personal taste.

Fabulous! I used condensed milk with a little water instead of cream because we like the taste better for white sauces. Thank you so much for sharing! The spices really make it tasty.

I found this very easy. I put some leftover vegs. from a  Christmas tray.  Instead of bacon, I threw in some leftover ham, and it was a very tasty soup.

I added dried potato flakes to thicken it instead of pureeing half the soup. It makes it go a little farther and I feel does not change the taste at all. It was delicious and I likely will be making it again.

This is a great starting point. I thought the original recipe was a bit bland so I added some bay leaves into the potato and stock along with the seasons so they had a chance to really build flavors. I also put pepper in while the potatoes cooked.   The prep time is longer than the recipe says and if you want to really get a good flavor let the potato mixture cook for a while before adding cream mixture.  I also held the bacon out until the end and topped with shredded cheese.  It was a hit.

Absolutely.  My mom made potato soup when we were kids and we would eat it every Friday.  This soup is so much tastier but we had it on Fridays and no meat on Fridays.I don't know if that included chicken broth.

Loved this soup, excellent flavor! I omitted the bacon and used half and half instead of cream. I also used organic vegetable broth, and sprinkled fresh parsley on top. My husband even likes this recipe cold from the refrigerator! Will make again. I used little Dutch Yellow potatoes, peeled.

This was amazing - honestly, my favorite potato soup recipe ever.  I made it according to recipe, with one change - I pulled the bacon out and then added it at the very end, so it stayed crisp.  Absolutely delicious and my entire family agreed!

It's an okay base but lacked in flavor, I had to dress it up. I substituted the Bacon for hamburger 1lb, 4 heaping tablespoons garlic, 8oz cream cheese, 1stick butter, cup heavy whip, whole can of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup velveta cheese, only 1/2 teaspoon salt. 1 cube chicken bouillon, 1/4 cup chives , 1 tablespoon pepper, 1/4 tsp cumins,1/4 tap coriander cooked in with the beef.  Was amazing! Definitely making again .

This is probably the best potato soup recipe I've made (and I've tried alot of them!). The only change I made was to use half the amount of potatoes and sub in sliced carrots and corn for the difference.  Also, the butter, flour, cream mixture for me quickly turned more to a paste than sauce consistency even though I was stirring it constantly and only cooked for the time cited.  However, once I whisked it into the soup, it was fine.  I did let it all simmer together on Lo with the lid on for about 10 minutes at the end.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Taste is good, but a little salty, so we put in half the bacon.  Would definitely make again but next time will use reduced sodium on the broth!

I‚Äôm not one to leave reviews on recipes, and I don‚Äôt even eat this soup because of the bacon, but my husband told me it was in the top 3 dishes that I‚Äôve ever made for him!  He loved it!  I pretty much made it exactly (except I omitted the cilantro and didn‚Äôt add a full teaspoon of tarragon and added more garlic) and it came out wonderfully!  It is time consuming, probably took about 2 hours start to finish, but we‚Äôll worth it (according to my husband).

Do not use the flour mixture.  I tried it and put it one glob and it just made little pieces of flour mixture in the soup.  I can see them in the video too.  Just puree a cup of soup and it gets thick on it's own.  

I did add one carrot to the mix and used 1/2 and 1/2 and added the bacon to the soup when served.

Delicious! I added some shredded carrots and changed the spices up a bit - instead of the spices mentioned in the original recipe I used a few dashes each of Penzey‚Äôs Bavarian spice and Krakow Nights, and a little shake of paprika.

Like other said, good base recipe. I added chopped carrots, small red bell pepper, fresh dill, parsley and broccoli. Instead of cream, I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk. No flour as it thicken nicely. And only 1/4 lb bacon. This soup is SO good. Sorry. But after 40+ years of cooking I just add what the pot is screaming for.

This is absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it's the best cream of potato soup I've ever made. And if you want a real treat, try substituting the bacon with 1/2 pound of diced cooked ham as I did the second time I made this soup.  In my opinion, it's even better with the ham.  Wonderful!  Thanks Karena for a great recipe.

Loved this soup.  I changed it up a little bit by using two bags of southern style hashborwns, a block of cream cheese instead of heavy cream and flour. Then I added 1/2 tsp dill and fresh chopped garlic chives and put it all in the crock pot on low for 7-8 hours... Delicious!!!!

I cut the recipe in half. I cooked it exactly as described except I added the bacon back in at the end and used green onion rather than white or yellow onion. I also used russet potatoes. I also used fresh herbs it‚Äôs delicious. Will make again. My husband said it was very good. It has tons of flavor not sure how other reviewers can dispute that.

Perfect BUT i made it even more perfect by adding carrots and roasted mushrooms and during the blending process i added fancy shredded parmesan cheese (did not add the bacon so these gave it the salty savory flavor)

Remember folks, a recipe is not set in stone but a guideline. Then it can be tweaked for your taste. After reading many reviews and hints I applied a few to the original recipe. One thing I found is not to use baking potatoes, they just don‚Äôt work. Tarragon is one of my favorite herbs so I added a little more. With friends over for lunch, they loved it. Yes, it does take time with the peeling and chopping so I made it the night before. It thickened up overnight and I just stirred in water before heating. Very nice recipe.

This is a great starter recipe. I modified this recipe to be dairy-free and gluten free for my household. To replace the flour and heavy cream, I made a cashew cream (cashews and water blended in nutribullet).  For additional flavor I cooked chopped leek root (the part below the "leaves") with the onion and celery. Blending part of the potato mixture with the cashew cream and cilantro is key to melding and distributing flavor throughout the soup. We topped the soup with chopped leek leaves. My kid loved this soup.

It lacked taste, although I couldn't use the cilantro as my husband gets the soapy taste from it.  It was also way too thick.

Loved this!!! Made it as written only substituting parsley for the cilantro as we are those people that don‚Äôt enjoy cilantro. Not sure why so many people complained about the timing of the recipe.  Calls for 50 minutes and it took me 60 first time as I kept looking back to double check ingredients and steps. Don‚Äôt waste your time preparing everything first. Cut the bacon. While that‚Äôs cooking I cut the vegetables, making sure to cut the onion and celery first. I had onion, celery and 2 potatoes done by the time the bacon was done. Finished the last of the potatoes while the onion and celery cooked. Time management*. Great recipe. Next time I might add some green onion and some bacon on the side for garnish to make it look pretty.

Add a bag of shredded sharp cheddar to the last step.  Also I didn't use the flour.  The cheese and the heavy cream will thicken the soup

I will definitely make this again! Cilantro was not an integral part of the flavoring, so you can use it if you've got some laying around but you don't need to run to the store and buy some. When chopping the bacon, do not remove too much fat! I didn't end up having enough grease.

Deelish. I had to use quite a bit more milk in my white sauce it was way too thick. I used canned milk. I also added chopped fresh carrots. Very tasty recipe.

Really good. I made sure to use chicken stock instead of chicken broth. I did not use cilantro or tarragon just because I do not like those flavors. I might finely dice some carrots next time and add them in with the celery and onions.

This was very good.  We used carrots, no celery, added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper during satay step.  We also added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  We used milk instead of cream, added a dash of cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp of parsley flakes to the soup.  We pur√©ed 1/3 of the mixture with some bacon.  We added the rest of the bacon at the end prior to serving.  Awesome!!!!!!

I liked the recipe but  I did not add tarragon and cilantro into the original recipe. After I was done cooking I added salt for flavor and I think it tasted better with the salt. I would make the recipe but not with big potato chunks.

This soup was very good! I did not put the tarragon or the cilantro due to them not being available at my local stores.  The first bowl I had was a little bland but I added some more salt and pepper and it was perfect. 10/10 recommend this recipe.

I enjoyed this soup. What I did differently was not using the spices because I thought the celery and onions would add enough flavor. I was wrong in saying this, so I had to use a lot more salt and pepper. Next time I would put the spices in. I would make this again and make sure to put the spices in.

This soup was sooooo good! Somewhat easy to make considering I‚Äôm not much of a cook. I added about 1/4 cup more of the broth and heavy cream to add richness and then sprinkled some grated cheese on top. Served in a bread bowl from the local bakery, this dinner is one for the books! I‚Äôll definitely make it again seeing as both my picky eaters ate almost all of it (it was a huge portion for them)!!!!!

So, I have made this recipe several times and it is excellent! 

Today I  Was in a jamb having several potatoes that I needed to use before they went bad. I  pulled this recipe up yet again.  When I opened the refrigerator to pull out the needed ingredients, I realized I had a decent size sirloin steak left over from the grill a couple of days ago. It was on the rare side. Lol, I  just went with it!

Cubed seared steak  instead of bacon, beef stock instead of chicken. I tossed a few cut baby carrots from fridge in with the potatoes and added about a cup if sliced marinated mushrooms from a huge jar we are constantly noshing on at the last minute. Had to use half and half instead of cream.

 When it was all done, I topped it with a fine shred Mexican cheese blend. OMG, I keep going back to the pot!! Lol, that man of mine better not be late getting home from work, there might not be any left!!

Good flavor, but next time I make it I won't use the flour. Mine turned out like mashed potatoes,  and I tried adding milk like I would to gravy to thin it out but it just got thick again over time.

This recipe was dynamite! I cut the bacon in half (because a pound would be over powering with the added bacon grease) also I added about a cup of velveeta cheese and cheddar cheese melted it in while making the cream base and it was fantastic! Pairs really well with ooey-gooey grilled cheese!! Defenilty gonna have to work out this weekend after this meal ;)

Very good, flavorful soup. And so easy to make. My two teenage boys absolutely despise soup, except for this one. They ask me to cook it often and they eat it numerous times throughout the day when they get hungry.

Used 1/2 lb of bacon (what I had on hand) and my potatoes were huge so I only needed 4. Also since cilantro is not fit to be eaten by anyone (IMHO) I used fresh parsley. This was a fantastic and delicious soup! I liked that it wasn't full of cheese and milk (just 1 cup cream). Yum, Yum. Perfect for a rainy day. I made fresh French Bread to go with it.

Best potato soup.  May take a bit of time to prepare  but well worth it.  I made a bit more than the recipe and it was gone in a day.

I love potato soup and I have made it many ways but this really is the best I've ever made.
I used russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Even my picky little eater is loving it and is on her second bowl.
Thanks for sharing.

Before we finished eating hubby said this is a 5. This is a flavorful soup. I have several potato soup recipe but I think this takes the top spot. I didn't have any heavy cream so used the butter & milk equiv. This is easy to make. I don't puree food (bad experience with hot foods) so took the potato masher & went at it until half was mashed up.

Cut the potato chunks thick and add milk. Only pur√©e a little, maybe 1/4. Adjust from there.

definitely best with the bacon (and cheddar and chives) added as a garnish just before eating. Fantastic soup! Half and half - not cream, and dill - not tarragon/cilantro.

I love the dried tarragon and fresh salon Truax, this made the flavor pop. I also took my cream and divided it in half with the heavy cream and half for half-and-half.

The soup was really good the SECOND time I made it. The first time, I made the recipe as written and it was nothing to write home about. I made a few corrections the second time and it turned out amazing. Here are the corrections - do not add the bacon to the soup!  Save the crispy bacon as a topping with cheese and green onions when served. Do not add tarragon and cilantro!  The tarragon flavor in the first batch was overwhelming and ruined the soup. DO add salt and white pepper to taste. This requires a lot of salt to balance the potatoes. The second batch with the corrections listed was great!

I made this but I did alter it so I will say that up front.  What I like best about this is it is from scratch as much as you can do it these days.  No soups or soup mixes.  Most stocks are pretty simple without a lot of additives.  I really cook from scratch most of the time to avoid the additives in so many premade items.  When you do this often you will start to taste the additives when you use them and it is not a good taste.  Great soup recipe and can be adjusted to suit individual taste.

I‚Äôll preface by letting you know I never follow recipes exactly. I use them as a guide or idea. I looked for a great potato soup recipe because I‚Äôve never found anything thick and creamy enough. This one is! Pureeing half the soup was genius! I didn‚Äôt have celery so I used celery flakes and different seasonings based on my preference. I also pur√©ed the onion, garlic, seasoning mixture before adding potatoes. It keeps the taste without the actual pieces of onion - a gamer changer if someone doesn‚Äôt really like onions. It also thickens and becomes creamy (because of the oil with it). And, I added the bacon at the very end. Delicious and excellent thickness/creaminess. Thanks!

Very similar to my traditional potato soup.  I liked it, but will use less bacon next time. I felt like that was the only flavor to the soup.

It was a hit with the whole family, I have never made potato soup with bacon reserves before.  We come from a southern family that uses bacon reserves for everything, so I though we woul givve it a shot and it was a hit!  I made it as directed, only I added a little more garlic, salt and pepper, and I let it simmer for a while so I did not return the bacon until almost ime to serve so it would stay crisp..  I will make gain

First time making this and it turned out great. Made some changes like using red potatoes and making it in a crock pot and not pur√©eing any of it. Also added a package of seasoned onion soup mix and different spices. Super yummy and easy to make on a cold day.

I made this and my husband , who is an excellent cook, said it was the best potato soup he has ever had!  I didn't have quite a pound of bacon and didn't use the tarragon or cilantro because I didn't have any.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  Awesome!  Will definitely make again!

I never follow recipes perfectly to the letter, but this one was incredible when I came pretty  close. The tarragon is key to making it taste like comfort food even if you decide to ease up on some of the other richer parts of the recipe.

I make this every other month or so.  I really believe that you should follow a recipe but tweak if desired. I used the chicken the 3rd time around I didnt like it as much. I do put smoke ham with the potatoes as it boils with chicken broth. My grandma, when she was alive, who didn't like potato soup, loved this

The key to making this revolves around the type of bacon used and how it is cooked. Be careful when cooking the bacon; if you allow the bacon to char it will overpower the flavor of everything else. Mine turned out really good; I didn't actually measure ingredients and used half and half though.

YUMMMM!!!! I followed another reviewers advice and didn‚Äôt add the cooked bacon until the potatoes were tender. I was worried about the tarragon being too strong but no way. It was so good! I made a double batch. My mom loved it and that means it‚Äôs really good! I did add sharp cheddar at the end and stirred it in. Cheese makes everything better.

I make this soup all of the time but I absolutely never have cilantro (I hate it), or tarragon in my house. That said I obviously omit those. I also save time by cubing and cooking the potatoes first while you cook the bacon that way you only have to throw it together in the end instead of waiting for the potatoes to cook. It really doesn‚Äôt need a lot of seasoning with all that bacon in there (being a New Englander I often use maple flavored) but I do often throw in a couple shakes of Italian seasoning. The last step of throwing half of the soup into your food processor and blending it to then reintroduce it back into the soup is an absolutely crucial step to making this soup great. I always save a few crisp pieces of bacon to crumble on the top when serving.

Only do on stove, Got too mushy in crock pot and tasted more like ham and bean soup. Also did not use 2 stalks of celery that is a lot of celery. Used chicken broth, worked great.

I made this a few times... I simply used this as a base for my own potato soup. To start I used the ingredients that I had in my kitchen already so we used regular potatoes (peeled), leftover ham from the holidays, butter, celery, onions, heavy whipping cream, chicken stock and scallions for garnish.  We cooked ours in a crockpot, following most of the steps as directed. I used seasonings that I liked in my flavorful soups, like garlic and onion powder, along with my favorite chicken soup base we added in with some butter to the stock.  This soup was very delicious, I like mine a little bit chunky and thick, so I mashed some of the potatoes in the crockpot once they got soft enough to mash. Will continue to use this as a base for my own potato soup recipe.  Season to taste is key!

Really nice recipe for our family! I added more potatoes and ham than indicated in the ingredients list and I sauteed the onions in a bit of butter to give them a sweeter flavor. Next time I‚Äôll add carrots‚Äîthat‚Äôs how my mom always made it when I was a kid.

Loved it!  Used real bacon crumbles (had on hand) 1 lb sausage in the pan to start. Used 1 cup high quality (with freshness date) cold pressed virgin olive oil instead of butter.  This recipe is very flexible, one of the best things about it.

I made this with lactaid whole milk and it was plenty rich and thick without the cream.  We have several with lactose intolerance.  The pot was "downed" quickly with several that were disappointed that it was gone already before they could get seconds.  Total hit!!! The tarragon really gives it a GREAT flavor.  I added cayenne for a "kick" since my family likes spicy.  I also used 1/4 cup all purpose gluten free flour and 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch since I have someone with celiac who ate some.  This soup was better than any you would get at Panera, even with the health changes.

My whole family loved this one. Followed all directions, except for adding tarragon. My grocer didn't have it. However, I could see why it would be even better with the tarragon as part of it. 

This soup needed no cheese, chives, or anything like I typically add to a bowl of potato soup. I don't know why it was so good, but it was.  Nor how cilantro works in potato soup, but it does. 

I'll certainly make this one again.

It turned out very yummy! My family loved it the only thing I changed was I used a lot more heavy cream to make it creamier. I think the bacon should have been sprinkled on top which is what I will do the next time. The bacon flavor overpowered it and pretty much made it bacon soup with potatoes lol. I added a little cheese on top also.

I didn't have any bacon on hand so I used some bite size ham pieces instead.  We loved the soup.  It was so close in taste to my Mom's whom I believed made the best but I have never been able to recreate it until now.

This is the perfect potato soup recipe! Very comforting and a little different from what you usually get for potato soup. My guests are always impressed by this. I used coriander instead of cilantro because of the love it or hate it factor that comes with cilantro.

We did NOT like this soup at all, sorry.  The bacon was flabby, the flavor was off, and who on earth puts cilantro in potato soup???  Hey, if it‚Äôs your thing and you like it that way, by all means make it.  But I prefer simple potato soup with the vegetables cooked in bacon fat, milk, a roux, and chicken stock. Maybe fresh thyme if you have it.  But the crispy bacon was added only at the table, along with sharp cheddar and sour cream.   The flavors in this recipe were not compatible to my family at all, and it was oddly flat tasting, as if it were under seasoned under all that horrible cilantro.   I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because I know some people love cilantro and add it to everything. But if you don‚Äôt enjoy that flavor, do not make this recipe, because it won‚Äôt work for you, even if you leave it out.  The soup was wan and bland .

Just made it here in snowy CO. Didn't have tarragon. Added Rosemary instead. Added a scoop of Kraft Triple Blend Cheddar and added the bacon at the very end so it stayed crispy-ish. Otherwise no other changes. It is delish.

This soup is delicious! My husband said it‚Äôs the best soup he‚Äôs ever eaten. I added 1/34 tsp tarragon and 2 cups heavy cream. It‚Äôs so creamy and flavorful. I also made the red pepper buscuits found here to go with the soup. So yummy!

I'm sorry, I dont normally write negative reviews but after following recipe exactly, I can attest this was brown, tasting predominantly of bacon grease, and so thick I was afraid to dump the entire pot down the garbage disposal. And I'd also like to see who can peel and cube 8 potatoes along with dicing celery and onion and bacon in the 20 minute prep time...all around very disappointed.

I followed the directions about 98%: slight modifications, used chicken stock, 1/2 1/2 cream and 3/4 teas tarragon rather than 1 teas.  Soup was wonderful.  Husband claimed it tasted like a soup from exclusive restaurant.

This is the perfect soup for a snow day! I only made minor changes. I added a bit more spices since it was tasting bland and I used 2 cups of cream since I made more potatoes. I also didn‚Äôt pur√©e but just mashed the potatoes a few times to thicken and it worked great. I think, however, next time I‚Äôll use a lot LESS bacon and saut√© the veggies in a little butter instead. As much as I love bacon, it overwhelmed the soup, in my opinion. My kids did give this recipe a thumbs-up and that‚Äôs what counts in my book.

Even if you have to substitute some of the ingredients (e. g. milk for the heavy cream or adding no cilantro because you're out) it still tastes so so good. I love it. I "puree" the soup a bit by sticking my electric hand mixer in it on low to medium for a couple of minutes and the texture is still great. So no matter if you follow the recipe loosely or exactly it's great. The flour cream mixture makes it. It's the only way I make potato soup now, thanks for posting it.

Loved this recipe.  The soup was great.  I used a can of evaporated milk and two tbs. more of butter,  as i didn't have any heavy cream,  and it was still perfect!

I followed the recipe to a "T" as I wanted to see how it tasted because of the great reviews.  Well, it was absolutely the best potato-bacon soup I have ever made.  Well worth the time it took to do.    If you love potato soup, this will become your favorite.

I saut√©ed my veggies in olive oil, not the bacon grease and added carrots. I also only had Yukon Gold potatoes on hand. After combining the cream sauce with the rest of the soup as directed, I also thought it needed a little more flavor, so I added a few generous dashes of ground white pepper, garlic salt and onion powder. I used my blender to pur√©e half of the soup...turned out DELICIOUS!!! Will definitely make it again now that the weather is starting to turn cooler!

This turned out awesome. I made a double batch in which I cooked the russet potatoes in one pot and cooked golds in another. I followed some others advice and added extra spices and broth. (I use Better than Bouillon)I mashed half the russet pot then put both pots together. I also added the bacon at the end of cooking. Time consuming but worth it.

I‚Äôve always had a little trouble finding a decent potato soup recipe, but so glad I ran across this entry.  I followed directions closely ‚Äì with a few suggestions from the comments  section. (I used a leek Instead of the onion, and added carrots. I also did not pur√©e as I prefer a chunky style soup.) Have to say this is one of the best homemade soups I‚Äôve ever made. The tarragon really makes the difference. Thanks for submitting this excellent recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I did add about 1/2 T of potato flakes to thicken it a bit more, but I prefer a very thick soup. I also substituted 1/2 t fresh basil and 1/2 t fennel seed instead of Tarragon bc I was out. Still turned out really delicious!!

This was my first time trying this recipe and I never follow a recipe to the "T". I used 1.5lbs of bacon, 10 potatoes and a package of cream cheese. I added the cream cheese to the flour mixture after I added the heavy cream. It turned out very good! A lot of work but definitely worth it!!

I followed the recipe other than not simmering the bacon, but setting it aside for the end. It was pretty good when I tasted it before seasoning. The cilantro was a bit overpowering for me and it was missing something. I added salt, garlic pepper, sour cream and a bit more cream. Topped with shredded cheese, bacon and green onions. I will make this again, but next time I'll try leaving in the bacon and using less or no cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this recipe several times a year. My family LOVES this recipe. I try to cut some calories by using half & half instead of heavy cream, not that it's helping that much, but every cut calorie is something anyways.  Yes, i will make this recipe again & again. ?? Yummy

I had my daughter help me make this, and she added her own twist, in that she accidentally dumped a lot of thyme into the soup as it was boiling! It brought a lot of flavor to the recipe. This is a fantastic base for a beautiful, hearty soup and it's fantastically customizable. I'll definitely be making it again and playing with the recipe.

I usually try to try new recipes as stated, and modify them when I feel they are lacking something. So, I did make this recipe as stated other than using evaporated milk instead of cream since that's what I had on hand. I didn't put the bacon back into the soup, but saved it for garnish. I used an immersion blender to blend some of the potatoes and accidentally blended in too many. So the soup initially came out very thick. Since my husband was standing at the stove ready for the taste test, he and I both tasted it and agreed it was too bland. We also agreed that it was too thick, but that was my fault. Since I made this soup for tomorrow night's dinner, I left it on the stove while I figured out what to do with it. I initially used peeled red potatoes, but decided to microwave some yellow potatoes to dice and add to the soup. Then I added enough milk to thin it some, but still leave it creamy. I also added 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh basil. After these additions, we did another taste test. WOW, the taste was wonderful. Since I had not yet added anything that would add to the flavor, I am assuming that it has to sit for a little while for all of the flavors to meld and come through. I should also mention that I used homemade chicken broth and not store bought. When I serve it tomorrow evening, I plan to garnish it with the reserved bacon and green onions. I really don't think it needs much of anything else.

I substituted onions with leeks for a less oniony taste. After the initial cooking prep work, I added the potatoes and broth mixture to a crock pot along with the rue mixture. I didn't puree the 1/2 because I figured leaving it in a crock pot for hours would break down the potatoes. It was amazing!

Very good, I made it as listed, except I didn't have cloves of garlic so I used garlic salt. Exceptional and didn't need pureed. I did add some minced carrots for color. Not super time consuming actually quick easy and well worth it. 
Perfect potato soup thank you.

Absolutely delicious! I've made potato soup the same way for a while and decided to try this new one out. So glad I did! One of my new favorite soups, for sure! I really didn't change up the recipe that much besides adding a few carrots for sweetness and green chili for some spice. I didnt puree at the end but that's totally up to you and how you would like the texture. Super happy I found this recipe.

It sounds gross, but I added slightly spoiled milk with a little sugar instead of the heavy cream (because I didn't have any) and it turned out absolutely perfect. The tanginess really paired well with the potatoes!

I absolutely loved this soup!  I had left over potatoes from twice baked and from a shrimp boil dinner,and some mashed potatoes (company for 10 days) which I added. I don‚Äôt have a blender at the cottage so I used a potato masher. I got rave reviews.

I had to use considerably more broth, and still in the end, it was too thick for my liking so I added a little water and half and half, which I used instead of heavy cream. In the end though, this was hands down the best potato soup I've ever had. Oh, I also left the bacon aside and used it as a garnish instead. So good.

Really enjoyed this potato soup recipe. Made a double batch and froze some for later.  At the end of cooking, I separated about half of it out and blended the remainder with an immersion blender.  I added back in the unblended portion for a creamy soup that also still had some potato chunks in it.

This really is the best potato soup! I‚Äôve made it a dozen times.  My suggestion would be to really crisp the bacon. And I always add a little extra celery and I often substitute half and half for heavy cream.

Delicious and rather easy to make.. i have no complaints at all.. even my 5 year old son enjoyed it which is about as rare as a flawless diamond. .. the only thing I added was 2 TBS of Fresh parsley, an extra TBS of fresh cilantro, 1 extra stick of celery, and a half teaspoon of celery salt.. and it was fire(as in amazing) lol.  Did have to add salt and pepper at the end but I do that with everything I make as it is. But overall I'd give it 6 stars but it only allows 5.

This soup was amazing!  I made it for my sons. I usually make enough dinner to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  My sons ate all of the soup.  There were no leftovers.  It was the best potato soup I have ever made or tasted.

Good. As several people mentioned, no need to do the processor step at the end. Just use a potato masher. Also cook without the bacon and add it at the end.

Good base recipe. I made changes based on our tastes. I used ham as well as bacon. (Add bacon at the end, so it doesn't get soggy.) Added more stock as well as leftover mashed potatos to thicken. Stirred in sharp cheddar at the end. Also used dill and chives rather than the tarragon and cilantro. Lots of compliments on supper!

This recipe is very flavorful and we enjoyed it tremendously. I kept the ingredients exactly as written but made it in my new crockpot, which has a saut√© feature. After returning the bacon to the pot and adding the broth, I turned it on 350 for 30 minutes. My family likes a smoother soup so after everything was cooked I blended it with an immersion blender. I think that was key, otherwise the bacon would have been chewy and kind of unappetizing. Blending it retained all the flavour that had cooked it. Wonderful!!

Worked out well in the slow cooker with a double size recipe. Did not cook potatoes in pan with any  with other ingredients, otherwise did same steps and took potato masher to the pot once spuds were soft. When I made the cream sauce, it appeared like there was way too much butter, but it all stirred in ok once potatoes softened up. Probably could‚Äôve used half the amount anyway if worried about calories. Good served with sour cream, cheese, and green onions

I make this about once a month. I use Red Skin Potatoes with the skin on. I cook down some of the Red Potatoes right into the broth. Then I add more potatoes about an hour or 2 before its complete. I add Bay leave and fresh ground pepper. The kids love it and so do I.

Absolutely loved this the first time I made it. Giving it a try with ham instead of bacon this time. Either way this is a great potato soup recipe.

Great soup even though I winged it a bit and did it ‚Äúmy way‚Äù HA! Cooked 8 oz bacon and added 4 oz with potato addition and saved the other 4 for garnish. For the most part there was little deviation and I did add whipping cream as per written directions and made the rue a bit thick however tweaked it in the final simmer with some 2% milk and it recovered nicely. No pur√©eing to thickening it was needed for sure! It is rich and hearty!

This was my first time making baked potato soup (I'm actually not much of a cook in general to be honest, but I'm trying to change that), and I must say, I hit a home run with this recipe! My husband (who is usually fairly critical) and my brother both said there's nothing they would have changed. One note that others have mentioned as well: This absolutely takes longer than  50 minutes. Took me about an hour and a half (and that was with some hustle and my husband helping a little bit). 

Notes on some changes I made: I mashed the soup instead of pureeing it (as one reviewer suggested), and the texture came out great (possibly better than a puree to be honest, since it was still thick and chunky). I also included some pre-cooked sausage when I threw in the garlic. This made the meal more substantive and added some great flavor. I also waited to put the cooked, chopped bacon in until the very end (instead of letting it boil with the potatoes). They stayed nice and crispy this way. I also tossed in some salt and extra tarragon. No cilantro.

I loved the spices and bacon for the main thrust of the flavor for this recipe.  This has a very pleasing flavor and is great for those cold winter days.  Will make again for sure!

Too much bacon! Couldn't taste garlic, tarragon or cilantro due to bacon (1 lb) being overpowering. Also, takes much longer to make than stated. Soup tastes good, but not worth the time and effort!

Great recipe.  Like others, I cooked the bacon, stored it in the fridge until we ate.  I didn't pur√©e 1/2 the soup either.  I like chunks of potato.  Once it was done, I served the bacon with each bowl and sprinkled the bacon and cheese on top.  The bacon stays crispy and so yummy!

This soup is ridiculous. So good!! I left out the tarragon and the cilantro. I didn't puree any of the potatoes - I just simmered the potatoes til they basically disintegrated. I used three Yukon Gold potatoes and three enormous russet potatoes, otherwise I followed the recipe fairly closely. This will definitely be added to the rotation.

It was later in the evening on a weeknight so I used a couple bags of real bacon pieces instead and it still turned out great. Having bacon grease like the recipe calls for would knock if out of the park.

Delicious.  I made it with ham instead of bacon. I used a quarter cup of butter at the beginning  instead of bacon drippings. When adding in the potatoes I also added cubed ham.  Best potato soup ever.

Good potato soup.  I did not add the cooked bacon while boiling the potatoes, but used it as a garnish instead.  I used almond flour to make my roux, and added fresh parsley and cilantro.  This goes in as one of my favorite recipes.

It was okay.... not quite sure what happened. It was a little bland and very bacony. We both agreed maybe it did needed green onions and cheese as toppings. Will continue searching and adjusting to find a good recipe.

This is a great basic recipe.
To decrease mess, I bake the bacon. Also, instead if taking out potatoes to puree, I used a hand blender in the pot (much easier!)
We dont have tarragon, so I substituted with our favorites.
PUT ON ROTATION 
Thanks

Made this soup the other night for the first time. When I find a recipe I want to try I usually follow it to a T just to see how it will turn out. I will then adjust the recipe to my liking from there. I will not be adjusting this recipe other than the amount of seasoning I use. This was absolutely delicious! I had a few friends over when I made it. They couldn't stop eating it. Definitely will be making this again.

Made it almost according to recipe except for:
   -  added cooked bacon to roux and took some soup broth to 
     thin cream sauce to accommodate
   -  used 1 tsp. fresh minced dill instead of coriander (cilantro)
   -  mashed instead of puree
   -  used 3 kinds of potatoes:  baking, boiling and fingerlings 
       w/purple potatoes
Served with fresh bread spread with garlic butter and Parmesan cheese, broiled.  FANTASTIC

This is a great recipe! I didn‚Äôt add the cream/flour mixture since hubby is lactose intolerant. To save time I added a bag of frozen Idaho hash brown dices with carrots and celery and cooked in olive oil, then added ham dices instead of bacon. Costco chicken stock is very flavorful so I added that with one pod of Knoor chicken flavor pod and LOTs of pepper. I cooked it for about 40mins until some of the potatoes became mushy to thicken the broth. This was soooo good. A keeper for sure since the hubby enjoyed it so much. He asked for it in his lunch for work, something he rarely asks. Enjoy and thank you for the recipe

I really love this soup! I use celery salt to give it a little more celery taste. To make a vegetarian version, I forego the bacon, use about 1/4 cup of butter and replace the chicken stock with vegetable broth. My family loves it.

I followed the recipe minus the tarragon and cilantro.  Didn't have any celery on hand but would have used.  The soup was a little too thick for my taste so I added a cup of milk.  Turned out great!!  Will definitely make again!!

This was disappointing considering the amount of time I spent preparing it.  I did not use tarragon, and my cilantro was dried (not fresh). However, I followed all the other instructions very carefully. This was very bland. We added lots of salt and pepper. I even used the chicken stock  as instructed. Maybe it's because I'm from the South where most foods are pretty rich, especially potato soup, but this did not turn out well.

Delicious soup.  I cooked the bacon ahead of time in the oven and then chopped and added to the top of the soup.  I would make again!

this is very good.  I didn't have a pound of bacon so I chopped up some turkey ham and saute it in some bacon dripping and put in some bacon bits used for salad.  I stuck with the other directions.  It was very good and hearty.

I made this soup and cooked it in the crockpot. I wanted all the flavors to meld together and it turned out awesome. I added carrots and a little bit of ham. I will definitely make this again in the future.

I baked my potatoes first... let them cool and then peeled and cubed them and added some additional garlic powder, onion powder and white pepper. I like the soup chunky so  I didn‚Äôt pur√©e at all, turned out great! Oh... I also used half and half  instead as well.

Wonderful soup!  I used 10 medium potatoes, 3 shallots instead of onion, 8 c. chicken broth, chopped carrots along with celery and it turned out great!  I also held onto bacon until the soup was done and added at the end so it wouldn't get mushy.

Just made it and is so good!!  It is a snowy day in North Georgia and just had to have soup.   So glad I found this recipe.  I didn't have tarragon so used dill,  white pepper and a dash of cayenne  No cilantro as my husband doesn't like it.  I didn't have heavy  cream so I used half evaporated milk and whole milk.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made the recipe as is. To the T. Is was a ‚Äúgood soup‚Äù. Nothing to write home about because it seemed bland. Made it a second time, still following the recipe as is, but with additional seasonings throughout the cooking process. 
Instead of pur√©eing, I used an electric hand blender. (The stick ones) this way I didn‚Äôt have extra dishes or have to transfer it around. The soup is definitely better the next day too, once the flavors have more time to meld. I also used a squirt of sriracha to the potatoes when they were boiling, gave some heat, but not overwhelmingly.

It was very good. I just don't find bacon or bacon grease necessary in my potato soup. My go-to potato soup recipe is from a mommy vlogger on YouTube. She uses just potato and onion. Her broth is just water, butter, chicken bouillon, salt, pepper, some spices, a thickener....and it's delicious. I'll stick with what I like, but it's good to try something new. This was good, but I didn't taste or notice the celery after, and got no extra kick from the bacon or chicken stock. I'll stick with my go-to and save money on ingredients.

I used leftover cubed ham in place of the bacon.  Instead of saut√©ing the onions and celery in bacon grease I used butter. I added diced carrots for color and frozen petite peas just before serving.  I used a full box of Swanson chicken broth plus a generous teaspoon of better than boullion chicken boullion. This was easy and relatively quick.  Just use a potato masher to get the chunkiness you want.  The basic recipe is great.  Easy add-ins. You will love this! It's delicious!

I added a cup of chopped ham and the bread bowl. It was so fantastic except adding the ham made  it a little too salty. If you do add the ham don‚Äôt add salt. Every drop of the soup was eaten best soup I‚Äôve ever made.

Excellent recipe!  Gave me a chance to break in my new Dutch Oven.  My only variation was to not 'Return the bacon to the pan'.  I reserved the bacon on the side as a garnish.  Instead I added a cup of cubed cooked ham as a substitute.  Worked out great.

Thought it was very good. Bypassed the bacon as we had some jalapeno cheddar deer sausage to use. Threw in a few extra potatoes (big family), a little extra celery and some carrots, doubled the cream, added a splash of milk and some parsley at the end, and spike seasoning when cooking the vegetables. Appreciate the great start.

We followed this recipe exactly except for the spices.  We added fresh parsley with a dash of red curry powder and omitted the tarragon & cilantro (not our favorites).  This soup was amazing.

It was fine, but not great. I really wish I had gone with a parsley/chive herb combo, instead of the tarragon/cilantro combo suggested here. Just my preference.

I prefer a more robust flavor. Next time I will add shallots and/or leeks instead of onions, and white pepper. I will DEFINITELY add the bacon as a topper, instead of cooking it with the soup. It is rubbery and soggy, not at all flavorful.  

I used my hand mixer to blend it up at the end. That helped thicken it up a little. I'd rather rely on cream and butter to thicken it up and enrich the flavor. I'll make it again, but with my modifications. My rating is based on the recipe as it's written.

So yummy! I love the tarragon in this! The only thing I did different is add the bacon at the end so it didn‚Äôt get super soggy. I also added crushed red pepper for a little extra kick (as well as a pinch of salt).

I have made this 2 times and working on a third. I cannot have any spices so I have alter this recipe for my food allergies. The only thing it's missing that I add is cheese. I add cheese individually to each dish served. I would also save the bacon until last and not cook it in the soup , just place it in the soup when serving with the cheese. I followed this exactly the first time and we felt as the bacon was too soft and wiggly. We liked it better when served with the cheese and melted into the dish.

This is an absolute ultimate soup! I added3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to it after I  put all the ingredients together to simmer! Then when i got my first bowl of it, I added a little sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crispy bacon crumbles on top of it! DELISH!

I made this for dinner tonight, and my picky family loved it! The only changes I made were I used beef stock instead of chicken, because I didn't have chicken on hand, and I also added carrots. Absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I like orher reviewers put the bacon in last, no need to 
cook it that much !  Also you don't need to puree, useless
step IMO. I didnt add any garlic because sometimes 
it can overwhelm nor did i use terragon. Old fashioned salt and pepper was plenty to give an awesome flavor.
It has bacon  in it how much more seasoning do you 
need? Lol 
Some ppl say it was alot of work, i disagree . It was one of the easiest soups ive made! Again, i skipped the puree step so that saved some hassle. LOVe This Soup!!!!

I wasn't sure about the tarragon, but it ended up being a nice addition. I didn't use the cilantro - I love it, but it didn't appeal to me for a potato soup. 

I really enjoyed the soup. I did add shredded cheddar to each serving, but it was still very good even w/o the cheese.

Delicious! I didn't use bacon; substituted olive oil in that first step.  I added a bit of salt, pepper, oregano & parsley to the onions, celery, & garlic mixture as they cooked. I also added fresh mushrooms that I chopped and sauteed with the cilantro & tarragon. The only seasonings I used were salt, pepper, & Goya Adobo. I skipped the puree step and instead mashed a bit of the potatoes as they cooked in the chicken stock. (I prefer the chunky potatoes for the stew instead of the puree texture.) For serving dinner, I added green peas and a pinch of shredded cheese to each bowl of soup. The whole family loved this one!

If you like potatoes or soup and haven't yet made this recipe, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.

My family loves this recipe!  After removing the bacon to the side, I always wait to add it back till after the soup is done and I've used my immersion blender to thicken it up a bit.  I also usually add 1 or 2 carrots and increase the cilantro.   I usually serve it with cheese or sour cream and green onions to top it.  Yummy!

Made this for tonight's dinner. It was fantastic! I see someone called it terrible, won't ponder a guess as to why that is their opinion. Maybe she forgot the salt and pepper. I added them a few times and then tasted it with each addition. I made a double batch so I could give half to a nephew. I added some carrot sticks to give it a bit more color. Will definitely make again.

The recipe was spot on regarding the ingredients but I agree with a previous reviewer in that it is on par when using a potato masher vs having to pur√©e. I'd also prefer to add bacon as a garnish on top when served, it would be that added level of taste, texture and crunch.

I have made this recipe many times, but I really use it as a guideline, since I am horrible at following directions. I add a lot more celery, onion, potato and also use ham and bacon.  I use whatever milk is on hand, 2% or whole milk and half and half.  I start by saut√©ing the bacon a bit, then add the onion and garlic, saut√© for a bit longer. I usually add a 5# bag of potatoes, or more, depending on who's coming for dinner, and cover with chicken broth to boil all ingredients at once. Then add butter and flour roue to thicken. Serve with chives or scallion, bacon crumbles and shredded cheddar cheese. Great Fall meal.

This is the best!  I doubt I'll ever use any other potato soup recipe again.   Next time I will only use half the flour, as I like my soup a bit thinner.   I was skeptical of the cilantro and tarragon together in a soup, but the flavors all blended perfectly.

I made mine slightly different I switched the chicken stock for vegetable stock (I already had it at home). I switched the tarragon and cilantro for Italian seasoning. The store I went to didn't carry tarragon and I just didn't want to use cilantro and it turned out great!!!! Everyone went back for seconds. Adding some shredded cheese and green onions on top really made this soup a flavor bomb! I highly recommend it.

They should include "incredible" to the title of this soup. The cilantro added just the right touch and I served crispy bacon and fresh diced celery on the side for those that wanted to add some crunch.

Love, LOVE this soup!!!! It is so good and hearty, wonderful for those cold winter nights.

I cut down my prep time a lot by buying precut onion and celery, using a jar of minced garlic and those little tubes you can buy in porduce of minced herbs :)

Maybe it's my preference, but the soup seemed really heavy and lacked flavor. There's another review saying it's a good base for personal preference. I definitely agree.

This is the best potato soup I've ever had! I changed the spices from cilantro and tarragon to a 1/2 tsp each thyme, sage and rosemary and it is delicious. I also added the bacon right at the end. Will make again.

This was a pretty good soup. The tarragon wasn't a very good flavor by itself. I agree with previous people that it's a base, and with added seasonings it can be an awesome soup. I believe I added parsley flakes, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. All of that made for a great tasting potato soup!

Simple to make, this recipe is a keeper!  My husband is a chef and recommended thickening with instant mashed potato flakes.  I used half-and-half, but don't skimp on the butter.  Cooks faster when the vegetables are cut smaller.  Save the bacon for a topping.  Also recommend shredded cheese toppings.  Yummers!

this recipe is so so good. inexpensive meal that gets devoured quickly. I never would have thought of tarragon but I really like it. I haven't added the cilantro because I never have any when I make this bit I am sure it would be good, I might add some salsa sometime instead. I add cheese and sour cream at the end.  we love it.

This is one of the best Potato soups I have had.  Easy to make, aromatic, and delicious!  I didn't have any bacon but I assure you, that will only make it tastier.  I did add about 1/4 cup sour cream.  Thank you!

I've made this soup probably 12-15 times now and it is by far the best potato based soup I've ever made/tried. It's perfect. The only thing I change is I cook the bacon in strips in a skillet then add some bacon grease to my Dutch oven to saut√© the veggies. I then chop the bacon and add it right before the cream mixture. That way the bacon holds some flavor. I constantly get requests for this recipe and I always give the credit to Allrecipes and it's  members!  Haha thanks OP!!

My picky 10-year-old absolutely loves this soup! Like other potato soup recipes,  it thickens as it cools and can dry out when reheated. Milk may be added before placing it in the microwave.

When I made this the first time I found it quite bland.  I've made it a few times since and here are the changes:
1. I use a whole head of garlic
2. Add worchestershire sauce
3.  Add cayenne pepper for a kick
4. I cook the bacon in the same pot I make the soup in that way I get all the bits from the bacon for more flavor.
5.  When I thicken the cream (I use 18% cream) I just use leftover bacon fat instead of butter.
6.  I don't boil the bacon.  I add it back in after I puree the soup.

There was a lot of prep work but worth it, I did add extra  garlic 6 cloves and I added carrots just our preference. Great base and we all loved it.

Okay, okay, gotta chime in here. Made an account just to post. This soup is absolutely fantastic BUT!! (It's a big but), I do not recommend add the fatty bacon back in to simmer with the potatoes. Just don't. If you're going to do it that way, make sure it's only meat and not fat as the fat turns back into, well, fat, and doesn't stay crispy. I mean, I should have known it would do it, but with two kids at my feet, I just wasn't thinking.

So please, if you make this, only place the crispy meat parts and not the crispy fat back in to simmer with potatoes.

Otherwise, I kind of winged it. It turned out fantastic. Is a great starter to add on your own. Would definitely make it again.

This potatoe soup is by far the best I have ever had, however I did add 1 cup dry white wine and 1 cup of milk.  I also used white pepper instead of black. Delicious!  I topped it off with sharp shredded cheese and scallions.

Use a potato masher instead of a blender. That way you dont have to wait till it cools. If it turns out too thick, add milk. I added 2 tsp Italian Seasoning and 3 slices of Pepper Jack Cheese to it. Turned out great!

This soup is full of flavour.  The few things I did differently are, I partially cooked my bacon ahead of time as I didn't want so much grease in my soup.  I added a bay leaf while the potatoes were cooking.  I used half and half cream and I added dill instead of tarragon and cilantro.  As my husband was enjoying his second bowl his comment was, "you have to make this again "

It was delicious, easy to make, and the fact that is used very little dairy is a plus for me..   I usually do not substitute on a recipe the first time I try it, but I did use Lactaid instead of cream and it worked just great. thanks for this!

Am in complete agreement with the assessment of CrystalS. This recipe is a good basic base to which one may add your own preferred flavorings. When ever I see the ULTIMATE verbiage attached to a recipe,  I'm mildly skeptical. My own additions were a good deal of additional herbal  interest and a heavier garlic presence.

Easy recipe and everyone had seconds.   I didn't add cilantro because people are divided over loving it or hating it and since kids from 4 to 11 would be included eating it, I played it safe and left it out.

This recipe was everything I have been searching for, and the only changes I made, was to the potatoes. 

I used a mixture of purple sweet potatoes and russet to give the soup a different texture and subtle sweetness. Once I added the sea salt in the end it all came together perfectly. Great recipe, easy to follow instructions.

I really did enjoy this soup! It was creamy and yummy and decently easy to make. The only difficult part was cutting up allll the potatoes (especially because I like small chunks) My suggestions are as follows:
- extra bacon, everything is good with extra bacon!
- add/melt cheese into the cream/flour mix, definitely some fresh parmesean 
- add some green onions

Chopped up pre cooked bacon added it to 3Tbs. of EVOO and 2Tbs. butter and simmered approx 5 minutes  then followed directions from there.  Also substituted 1/2 C. of cream with 1/2 C. 2% to not feel so guilty about calorie count, and wife will appreciate it.  And  added 1/2 C. chopped shitake mushrooms.  Outstanding.  Highly recommend.

I did not change any ingredients.  However, I only pureed about 2 cups of the soup which was plenty enough to thicken it up.  The whole family loved it.  Better than any restaurant or recipe I've had.

It tasted great. Fed 3 adults and 5 kids. I wish it wasn't so thick. I measured precisely by the directions. Had to add extra chicken stock to thin it out. It has a unique taste. Worth making once. Just wasn't the old fashion taste I was searching for.

I just spent 2 hours making this and my boyfriend said "it's edible, but it's not very good" no matter how we tweaked it. I followed the recipe and the video and it looks how it should but...I can only imagine you would like this if you like bland food. It tastes dirty. Even after salting and peppering it several times and retasting. Tarragon and cilantro do not make a good flavor profile for potato soup.

I made thIs and it's good.  However, three cloves  of garlic, I thought was too much (I love garlic btw) so I used 2 and that was still overpowering!  I suggest using one.

I have been using all recipes for quite some time and this is the FIRST TIME that I have chosen to do a review... I love to cook and I find that this site usually has the best recipes and the best reviewer comments... So, I decided that I needed to start giving back ...:)

I read about 40 reviews of this soup and so, I was prepared that it might taste TOO BLAND at the end...The only substitution that I made in the beginning was that I chose to use RED POTATOES instead of the russet potatoes... That was a personal choice and only because I prefer the buttery taste of red potatoes... Since, I was using a 5 quart cast iron skillet I needed about 16 red potatoes instead of the 8 russet ones...

I know a lot of the readers were concerned about the cilantro but it is VERY MILD... In all honesty I probably would have doubled or tripled the amount that was suggested but I am from San Antonio, TX and I love cilantro in almost everything...

This recipe does get VERY THICK so, I added an additional cup of 2 % milk in order to give it more of a soupy consistency...

As one reviewer said "This is a GREAT BASE RECIPE"... but it is far too bland... Like Crystal S. I added additional ingredients:

 2 tsp white pepper, 2 leeks saut√©ed in butter and salt, 1 tsp of Cayenne Pepper, an additional 1 tsp of tarragon and a tablespoon of parsley flakes towards the end and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! 

I did not add the bacon pieces until  the last 45 min so as to avoid the bacon becoming soggy...

I have made this twice now as it has become a family favorite.  I have omitted the tarragon and cilantro , however the soup was fine without.  Very easy to make.  Next time I may incorporate some leeks and also cheese on top, but otherwise this is the easiest and greatest.

I decided on this recipe after taking stock of what was in my fridge that needed to be used up - bacon, caramelized onions, chicken broth, cilantro, cream, and a bag of potatoes. I can't place the taste of tarragon, nor did I have any, so didn't include it. I also don't like celery in soups so did not include that either. The caramelized onions were what made the soup though. They'd spent more than an hour on slow heat and added a distinct but delicious flavor. The cilantro was great also. I never would have thought to include it in potato soup. I'm looking forward to the leftovers tonight as the flavors have probably  matured after being chilled for a day. I'm adding this recipe to my favorites.

This is my first potato soup.  I mean, I've eaten a ton, but never made one.  ;)  I used vegetable broth because that's what I had and ended up adding Better than Bouillon (chicken) at the end for flavor.  I used someone's recommendation to skip the flour in the thickening mixture.  And I used someone else's recommendation to hand mash 5 times or so instead of pureeing.  Those seemed to be great recommendations.  I added broccoli and carrots because I like 'em.  I might try it without bacon in the future, but why?

Great base recipe. This was my 1st time not only making but eating Potato Soup. I make potatoes of some sort a minimum of 3 times a week so playing w/ the flavor and spices in this recipe was second nature. I didn't really use measurements and just kinda added what felt was right. I also waited until about the last 2-3 min of cook time (after the puree step) added a good bit of diced (1/2-3/4 inch square) leftover Thanksgiving ham along  w/ the bacon. If you add bacon earlier it will have the taste & texture of boiled bacon. YUCK! Very pleased w/ this recipe, I will be adding it to my online box & my family keepsake handwritten box.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  I started making it several years ago on holidays, and now it has become a regular part of our dinner menu options.  One tip I might add: If your soup is not as thick as you like, add a small amount of instant mashed potatoes to help thicken.  I found that I can lessen the flour I used in the roux and make up the thickening with the instant potatoes.

As good as Houlihans Baked Potato Soup!  Made it with ham as I had leftover from Christmas. Still wonderful!  Added about a cup of cheddar at the end to help it thicken. Used dried basil instead of the tarragon and cilantro.  Tasted wonderfully!  I'm a fan of pur√©e-ing half as it made it easier to chop things in larger chunks and not having to worry about making it all bite sized. Definite keeper here!

Very easy, thick and filling. I set out a wide variety of croutons to add  in it. I do not care for soup, but when my elderly mother told me she wanted potato soup on Christmas Eve, I thought oh goodie. But even I really did enjoy this one. Give it a try, it really is super easy, fast and delicious

I need to back off the flour thickening quantity next time.  My inexperience was at fault, just added a bit more broth to thin it out.  It was fantastic and will definitely make it again!

I LOVE this potato soup recipe. Changes I've made: I used ALL the bacon grease, and I added 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar cheese and 1 cup of sour cream.

Excellent recipe! I added a sliced leek with the celery and onion. I thought it gave it a richer flavor, but my husband wasn't a huge fan of that. I also doubled the garlic and added a jalapeno (personal preference, I  do that to pretty much everything). I don't like tarragon, so I omitted that. Topped it off stirring in a handful of cheddar cheese. 

I usually roll my eyes when someone rates a recipe and says they modified it that much, but I also love reading people's modifications. haha. 

Best soup I've ever made.

I changed the prep time and gave every phase time to cool to room temp before combining to the next phase. I'm not sure if it made a difference but the  was the ??!

Really great! Made as is, no changes. Served with shredded cheese, chopped green onions and crumbled bacon as a garnish. Thanks for the great recipe! - - - - - - I am amending this just a bit... You will need to have extra chicken broth on hand to reheat it... Otherwise it's like eating mashed potatoes ;)

Good basic potato soup with plenty of bacon flavor.  
The key is the quality of bacon - the more smoked bacon flavor, the better your soup will be.

I used Yukon Gold potatoes -very rich and smooth.

The heavy cream is the key ingredient and making a roux to thicken it is important.  

Another review stated a little complicated, but its pretty easy other than making the roux.  

Kids gobbled it up.  I didn't have cilantro, but that didn't matter.

The cream makes it pretty rich, so I think you could substitute whole milk and that would still make a great soup - just not as rich.  maybe a little less thick.

Adding sausage or some kielbasa would make this very harty.

I work at a cafe and make souls a few times a week for us. Monday evenings we have a dinner special, and the week before last my manager made bacon, ranch, chicken and we had a bunch leftover. When that happens I like to make it into a soup so I thought of putting it into this potato soup...it was a smashing hit! Everyone has been asking for it since.

This soup was SO GOOD! I did not add the tarragon or  cilantro only due to personal tastes, but my daughter and I absolutely loved it. I also added a couple tablespoons of shredded sharp cheddar in each bowl just before serving...excellent!

This soup is fabulous, delicious and lip smacking good!  I have never been a potato soup lover -- until I made this. The only change I made was using an immersion blender on the whole pot -- as opposed to half of it, but that's just personal preference.  I love the richness of this but want to cut back on some of the fat. So today I'll make it using half and half instead of cream and see how that works. But whatever, this soup is a favorite in my house and there's never a drop left!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Husband hates soup.  He eats this like crazy.  It's a race between him and the 3 kids to whom gets more.  I now double the batches, and omit the tarragon and cilantro in order to get some myself.  The simple base is the biggest hit with the family and now co-workers.  Great quick dinner, especially if you have potatoes about to turn.  The skins on is fine too, just FYI.  It's only as spicy or bland as you choose it to be.  Delish!

This was great. My husband liked it well enough to ask for a bowl to take in his lunch, and he doesn't do it that often. I made a couple changes because I wanted to use Thanksgiving leftovers. I used left over white turkey and cubed it up and heated with the veggies once they were cooked. I also had left over honey baked ham, so I diced up a few sliced of that and fried it instead of using bacon. Everything else, I kept the same. It was great.

Great recipe. I didn't have tarragon so I think it tasted like something was missing. I used a beer seasoning blend for grilled chicken and it took this soup to the next level! Also, I threw in a cup of sour cream for good measure.

Very good! I used thick-cut bacon, which held up well during cooking. I did not add the cilantro and wished I had not used the tarragon, as my husband did't care for it (thought it tasted "sweet"). It would have been fine without the herbs. Next time I will add a little more celery and garlic.

The ULTIMATE comfort food. I added extra broth because it was a bit thick for me, but the flavor was beyond amazing. My Colombian husband called this "gringo ajiaco", which is a really high compliment. Ajiaco is a delicious Colombian chicken and potato soup that his mother and grandmother make so it basically reminds him of childhood and home. This soup definitely generates that same comforting feeling. We will definitely be adding this to our regular rotation.  :)

This soup was AWESOME!  Everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe. I made 2 batches and ran out quickly!  The only thing I did different is fry my bacon and chopped it afterwards.  I also left out the cilantro and the tarragon. Only because I don't care for cilantro and I didn't have any tarragon. It was yummy with cheddar cheese and crackers!

I didn't have any bacon or celery on hand so I cooked the onion, garlic and subbed chopped green onion for celery in a little oil. After adding the potatoes and chicken broth I knew I needed extra seasoning to make up for the lack of bacon grease so I threw in salt, pepper and two big spoons of chicken bouillon. Then came the problem- when I tried to melt my butter and whisk in the flour I found it very difficult. It formed giant clumps then made a dough. This dough was delicious but bad for soup so I added in the heavy cream (used about an extra cup), cooked it for a couple mins with the clumpy dough and threw it in my blender. I think I added the flour too quickly, not sure but my blender solved that problem. I poured the creamy mixture into the pan and cooked it some more before combining it with my potatoes then I did puree half the soup like the recipe calls for.  At the end I cooked up some sliced sausage and added that in before serving as well as some fresh parsley on top. The consistency would have been too liquidy without my extra cup of heavy cream... The melted butter and flour mixing ended up terribly. So I would say the recipe was just okay.

This is just about the best soup I ever made.  So flavorful!  The tarragon really pushed it to the top.  I skipped the cilantro - not my favorite.   Hope it freezes well because I will never be able to eat this much so fast.  It's going to be a great winter.  Tomorrow corn bread.

The taste was good.  I didn't have celery or cilantro, but it was the texture that I didn't care for.  Mine seemed a bit grainy, not smooth in appearance, which I have not experienced before when making other recipes of this sort.  Usually I don't use a recipe, just wing it.  But I had a lot of bacon to use up and this seemed to be a good Sunday evening meal choice in November.  I will go back to my own devises.  At least it wasn't greasy.

As other reviews have noted, the time required is waaaay to low for this. It look me close to two hours, too, but it was so worth it. I love the flavor, even though I used chicken broth and half and half, the latter to somewhat cut calories. It was a little too thick to suit me, and I think I'll try cutting the flour by about a tablespoon the next time.

Great homemade potato soup and so easy!! I did cut back on the garlic and it still had a nice flavor of garlic, just a little lighter. I topped it with chives and shredded cheddar to serve. I I will make it often over the winter.

Simply Delicious! I used 4 carrots in place of celery since I didnt have any celery and used chicken broth instead of chicken stock for the same reason.  The soup was amazing! Hubby was raving about how tasty and yummy it was! Perfect for a cold NY winter day. Next time however I will not blend have the soup as recommended I will only simmer longer until potatos soften and thicken the soup om

The prep time for this is way off...a bit more work intensive but well worth it.  I cut the recipe in half, only feeding two of us.  It still left plenty of leftovers so cutting it in half would be plenty for a family of four, IMHO.  Okay, don't cringe...but I added Tony's creole seasoning to the first step and the last.  My hubby like spicy food so I knew I had to jazz it up.  I thought I had tarragon, lord knows I have every other spice known to man. But, I did not, so used Thyme instead...it was fantastic.  Huge hit and I will defiantly make this again.

Outstanding! I made this for a fall party. Potato soup was just perfect around the fire pit. Close friend is a lifelong chef and he loved it. I used chicken broth  and simply used a hand potato masher instead of food processor to mash about half the potatoes. I served with shredded cheddar cheese as an optional topping. I was even better the next day!

This soup is easy, fast and delicious. I used 3/4 # bacon, substituted lemon thyme for cilantro and used half and half instead of heavy cream. I did not mash any of it as it was very thick and didn't need it. Will be my go-to recipe for potato soup!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  He added cheddar cheese on top, I was ok with it as it.  We didn't have tarragon in stock, so I substituted about a teaspoon of rosemary and a teaspoon of sage and it still tasted great.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of chooped carrots that needed to be used up.  Tasted great.

This recipe is almost perfect as is. I love the cream instead of milk. The only change I made was I substituted marjoram for the tarragon just b/c I didn't have any on hand. I also minced 6 cloves of garlic rather than 3. I don't care what the others said about skipping pureeing half the soup. Absolutely do that! If you throw it in the blender there isn't much mess, totally worth the extra dish to wash. It gives the soup better flavor and makes it more creamy. I grew up on creamy potato soup and I don't like it any other way. I did add about 2 teaspoons of salt, to me potato soup should be salty. As others said be aware start to finish time is assuming your vegetables are already chopped. Plan on about 2 hours from start to finish. Add some shredded cheese to your bowl of soup to serve! Thanks for this recipe it will definitely be in my winter time rotation!

Don't be shy with the bacon: Worth getting the good brand--and using half or all of the package; the key to getting that smoky flavor is in using the bacon grease!!  Don't worry about  thickness either; this recipe takes care of that.  Add all your favorite baked potato fixings with each bowl you'll enjoy; makes a great cool / cold weather soup!!

Yum! I only used about a 1/3 of a cup of cream and added 1% milk to make the full cup- didn't miss it one bit! Great recipe!

This is perfect. Used white pepper (BIG DIFFERENCE), and vegetarian bacon. I accidentally boiled the potatoes until they were very soft, like you would for mashed potatoes, and this works wonderfully for a thick, stick to your ribs stew.

Dynamic recipe. I followed the recipe almost as written and also added about a quarter cup of Leaks with a small onion. I used bacon instead of butter to saute the vegetables and did not add carrots or tarragon. I saved some  bacon to sprinkle on top of the soup on the finished product. Thank you for all your posts... They're so helpful especially when deciding whether to use broth or chicken stock. It does make a difference. I used chicken stock , it makes it so much more flavorful. I think the bacon and the butter makes it salty enough so I didn't add any salt, and seasoned it with cayenne pepper. Thanks for the recipe Karena.

I made a few changes. I added carrots, celery and onion together when sauteing in bacon drippings. After my potatoes were tender I mashed them with a hand held mixed to make them nice and smooth.I also used cheese in my rue sauce which made a creamy cheese flavor . The cheese allowed me to use milk instead of cream. The result was a lushes creamy flavorful soup the whole family loved.

I added shallots as the stores were out of leeks.  My family loves leeks in potato soup.  This is our first with the bacon and it was amazing.  Again, just a few mashes with the masher, great consistency.  A great freshly baked bread from whole foods, and we had a great meal.

Sooo....I live with my  parents who now need some help due to health concerns. My mom, who will rarely ever admit that my cooking is as good (and never better) than hers, gave this a very high rating and even complimented me! I have made this before for my ex-immediate family with rave reviews, as well. I didn't change a thing and this always comes out delicious. Thanks for making me look like a "real" cook in my mother's eyes. She sometimes forgets that at 50 y.o., I have actually learned how to cook. You know how it is... ? Oh! I forgot, I did add chives when serving this--very good addition!

Made this for my Family last night, and everybody loved it. (I used a lot more onion because i had a huge onion, but it was still delicious. I made the bacon separate, because not everyone likes it, it was good with, or without

Tip: a little bit of hot sauce can make this taste much better
*make sure to season more than the recipe says, or it'll be bland, but don't taste test util after cream mixture is added.

Wonderful! Tasted even better the next day. The few changes I made were based on my taste and what I had available. I baked some broccoli in the oven until crispy, chopped it and added it towards the end of letting it simmer. I also added some fresh rosemary along with the cilantro. Put a few shakes of red pepper flakes as well. I like my potato soup chunky so I only blended 1/3. It really had a wonderful taste. I garnished with paprika, fresh parsley and a generous portion of sharp cheddar. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely will make again!

I made this last night but I didn't need to make up the cream mixture, I just blitzed up the soup in the pan as much as I wanted to and added some double cream. I also added some left over cabbage at the same time as I added the potatoes and it was gorgeous. No need to buy any special herbs to make this recipe, you should already have all the ingredients in your cupboard.

This is my favorite potato soup.  The bacon is a nice touch.  It's amazingly easy to make, too.  I make a big batch and this is great for a quick easy dinner after a long day of work.

If I could rate this recipe a ten, I think I would. This is the best potato soup recipe that I've ever made, ate, or heard of...I'm not telling my mom that I just made that comment. I made this recipe just as it is listed except I used gluten free flour and left out the tarragon, only because I didn't have any. My husband and one year old couldn't stop eating it. I think the leftovers the next day were even better. I started a diet after this meal, this was like my "last supper" and I couldn't think of a better dish to go out of naughty foods on. Thank you for sharing, it's a keeper.

I did everything in a different order while trying to wrangle my toddler. I also added cheese to it to be more of a baked potato like soup. I used a bit of truffle oil and Black Sea salt for a bit of flavor change.

This is a Great Soup.  Everybody has different tastes.....so if you like cheese add it...More pepper...add it.  White pepper instead of black.....you get it.  This soup is great for that.  Because at the end you can eat it as it....WHICH IS GREAT or add to your taste.

Thank You

Just finished making this yummy soup. I'm allowing it to cool and will reheat it later for dinner, which I'm sure will make it only better. I saved 1/2 the bacon out to use for topping, I'll also top with a little shredded cheddar and sliced green onions.  I did have to add a little more liquid - chicken stock and a little cream. I used almost double the amount of tarragon as well. I would note that it would be nice to have more of a guide to the amount of potatoes than just '8 potatoes' - what kind of potatoes? It would be better to give a number of pounds since potato sizes vary so much. Also, 3 teaspoons is equal to 1 Tablespoon, makes it a whole lot less of a hassle to measure out the freshly chopped cilantro. :D I'm surprised at the people that said this was a lot of work. From beginning to end it took me 1 hour and 5 minutes. Maybe because I love to cook? To me that is a quick meal. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I always like to try recipes in the exact form they are presented in, otherwise it seems unfair to rate it.  This recipe is delicious, the only change I made was to add the bacon back in last (because I didn't want it to get soggy or lose flavor) and I didn't puree, but mashed some of the potatoes as others have suggested (because I don't have a food processor).  My only suggestion is don't forget the "salt and pepper to taste" part of the recipe.  After reading all these reviews, I was expecting to be blown away when I first tasted it.  But instead it was extremely bland - but once I added a teaspoon of salt and a 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to the pot and blended well - it was perfect for my tastes.

Okay.  Obvious, but not so creamy with only a cup whipping cream & about four cups chicken broth.  A good choice to warm ya up on a cool night.

I've made this wonderful soup without adding the rich cream.
I've added chopped cabbage with noodles, and it turned out quite tasty, and less fatty.
This is a favourite already.

This soup recipe is very delicious! I did add some finely chopped carrots. I did not add the bacon til the end.Another review said rhe bacon gets soggy if added in step 2. I did go ahead and puree half in my blender.I was fine, just a few extra dishes to clean.This recipie shpuld be made when you have lots of time! I doubled the ingredients so I can share with family . Definitely a repeat recipie!

I tried this recipe and the taste of licorice (tarragon) just doesn't belong in potato soup.  I think it would've been a really good recipe without the licorice taste.

I didn't have celery and no tarragon or cilantro.  Otherwise I made this just as the recipe said.  SOOOO good!  My friend ate a bowl.  Her mother was Irish and potato soup was a contant staple in her home.  She never heard of onion or bacon in potato soup.  She liked this recipe however.  Can't wait to have my mother and daughter try it.    Update:  mother said it was good.  She keeps telling me how good I did with this.  I will make her some more.I doubled the portions.  This will become a regular meal from now on.  YUMM!

I made this and it was so simple and flavorful.  Only change I made was adding a tablespoon of dijon mustard to give it a little zing.  

I will definitely make it again.

I thought this soup was amazing!! I made a few changes to suit my family and friend's tastebuds. I did not use tarragon or cilantro. Instead I used white pepper and thyme. I used a little more celery and 1 large carrot for color. My Irish friends raved about it! Thanks:-) Oh...I used Yukon Gold potatoes which work well for soups because they retain shape but can also mash well in the blender.

This really is absolutely fantastic!  I used homemade chicken broth and I think that's what made a difference.  So full of flavor and the texture is exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't use the tarragon or cilantro and I didn't puree any of it, but otherwise, followed the directions.  I'll be making this again for sure.

I ended adding more ingredients one at a time, and tasting, only to continue to be disappointed. Finally was able to serve it by adding pesto- about 1 tablespoon.

I saved the bacon for garnish, also shredded cheddar garnish.  Used a little more spice and some hot sauce.  Also cooked the potatoes longer in the bacon drippings.  Very good, hubby ate 3 bowls.

I added carrots and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper. I did not puree half of it because it was really super thick and I was worried it would become like paste. Next time I will use a little less flour.  Super easy to make and the husband liked it. Tomorrow I will serve it with some yeast rolls.

Delicious & easy.  I left the bacon as a garnish and added left over turkey.  Turned out great.  Thank you for sharing.

Oh man, this was SO GOOD! I don't own a food processor, so I mashed half of the soup with a potato masher and substituted marjoram for the tarragon. Delish!!

This recipe is probably a good base recipe in my opinion however I found the taste of the cilantro totally ruined the recipe. I couldn't  even think  about how to fix it. I read in some reviews that some thought it tastes like soap and that is totally how it smelled like to me just on my hands from handling it. I used less than 1 tablespoon to be on the safe side and I still couldn't eat it.  I was wary of using the cilantro but I read so many good reviews that I thought I would try the full recipe first before I made any hasty decisions.  Too bad I didn't go with my gut instinct, this was not a cheap recipe to make, don't even talk about my time. I am still willing to try the recipe again and tweak it to my personal taste. I most likely will not try the recipe again with the tarragon either.  Maybe I'm just a plain Jane......

This was a hit at our house.  Very yummy!  Make a double batch if you want leftovers - it disappears quickly!  Only sub was dried herbs instead of fresh.  I also had to use a hand potato masher instead of doing the pur√©e because the blender died.  Turned out great!  Thank you!

**Update:  I used the blender to pur√©e this time and oh my goodness!  Sooooo creamy and makes the flavors really come through.  This is one of our favorite recipes.  Thank you for sharing!  :-)

This was a nice base, but needed tweaking. I added a few chopped carrots to the saut√©  of celery and onion. I also added a generous tsp. of salt when I added the potato to the pot. I did not have any cream, so I used 2 TBS of butter and 3 TBS of flour to make a roux, with about 3/4 cup of whole milk (I was making only 4 servings). After adding this to the potato mixture, I added about 1/2 cup of a grated Italian blend cheese. I'll definitely make again!

I  was really excited to make potato soup for my elderly parents.  Well, unfortunately the soup was boring and my mother didn't like it and she loves potato soup.  Not sure if I did it right by cooking the bacon with the soup instead of just sprinkling on top.  After the bacon was cooked I put it in with the soup.  This was the wrong choice.

I have to eat gluten-free, so I didn't use flour, though I could have used GF flour.  I used Half and Half instead.  I also omitted the cilantro.  I left the skin on 4-red potatoes, peeled the other 4.  Great soup, thank you!

I made this soup last night for dinner. I did not add the tarragon; I did however,  add some shredded cheddar to the top. There are only two of us in the house and usually a large amount of leftovers go to waste. That will not be case with this soup as it is nearly gone already. It was amazing!

Like others have mentioned I found the soup to be a bit lacking in the flavor department. I tackled this by grating a bunch of extra sharp cheddar right into the bowl, topped with ground pepper, and it just took the soup to a whole nother level. 

Great on a cold day after your miserable city commute.

Absolutely AMAZING!  I didn't have any cilantro, so I omitted that. And used a vegetable base instead of chicken stock. For my dairy free toddler I pur√©ed the soup, then put some soup aside for him, before adding the cream. He loved it!  The second time I made it, I used leftover Christmas ham and it was just as delicious

Saut√© onions, garlic while heating stock.  Add potatoes/onion mix to stock and use onion pan for flour mixture.   I added a cup or  more of stock  to make it more "soupy".    Maybe leave skins on potatoes next time.  Yum!

Vegetarian version
I make this without bacon and with vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. This is a fantastic recipe. The tarragon and cilantro make it really taste fresh.  Possibly the best potato soup I've ever had. I've made it several times and it is always perfect. I sometimes add a Parmesan rind if I have one.

Everyone's right about this one!
I made a few changes, put bacon in after pureeing with all the drippings didn't drain.
Added 1 teaspoon of rosemary,& a couple dashes of tabasco sauce, and a chicken bouillon cube to the chicken stock.
My husband will not eat cream soups,but he tried this one and loved it.

Make this soup twice. The second batch I added a cup of cooked chicken breast, diced. This added a little more texture and flavor. Both batches were execellent, great recipe!

Great soup. I did not need to pur√©e this. Also, I needed to add more liquid at the end. And most importantly, the instruction to season to taste is extremely important here. I had to add a variety of spices to get some depth of flavour (added thyme, garlic powder, paprika, celery salt, parsley, and hot sauce). This is especially true if you need this to be a vegetarian option because you lose all of that bacon flavour.

Very Good, I did not have the heavy cream so I substituted with whole milk and some additional butter.  Used red potatoes. It did thicken up  a lot which I liked. Added some water to the left overs before putting away.

Made this a little healthier but switching up some ingredients: only used 1/4 lb bacon-chopped it first then rendered. Also only used 2-1/2 tablespoons  of butter. Used fat free low sodium chicken stock and also a combination of fat free and regular half and half. The soup, even skinnier was amazing!

This was super yummy. My potatoes were huge, and I like the soup extra creamy so I doubled the roux. We also don't like onions, so I doubled the garlic, and we had no celery so I used celery seeds. I added 25% more bacon fat, and replaced 25% of the heavy cream with milk. It came out delicious. I didn't have to put the potatoes in a blender. I cooked them in the pan as called for and then boiled them on medium heat until they were tender. Talk about creamy goodness and comfort food. Perfect for a snowy winter's day.

This soup was fantastic! Very hearty and flavorful! I went with half an onion and added diced leek in place of the other half. I added the bacon last instead of boiling it with the potatoes. I also didn't bother with the pur√©e, opting to use a potato masher a few times instead. I will definitely be making this again!

OH. MY. GOB. This is, without a doubt, the BEST potato soup I have ever eaten. The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used vegetable stock instead of chicken, because it's what I had on hand, and I used dill instead of tarragon. I also added carrots and kale. AMAZING. Even my son who hates potatoes loved this soup!

Awesome soup!  Used a pound and half of bacon and added 3/4 pound of diced ham (made a double batch) and cut back a bit on the potatoes.  Overall, very good!  Make sure to season with salt and pepper to taste when you are done.

We made this last night.   I halved the written recipe because it's just the two of us (I made for 4).     Hmmmm, don't know why it didn't turn out as I expected.   Very thin.   Saved leftovers and we are going to retry (leftovers) again tonight.   I cooked a few more potatoes, onions, celery and some garlic and added to the soup.   
Just finished our second day.  Yum!     Much thicker.    Maybe letting it sit was good.  Adding  3 more potato's, and onions, celery, and garlic helped. 
Will absolutely make again.

This soup was very good, especially with a bit of shredded cheddar sprinkled on top. There was no need to puree half of the soup as it was already very creamy and the potatoes were falling apart.  The only change I would make is to use half or even a third of the bacon. I really wanted to taste the potatoes and there was too much bacon in each spoonful for my liking. The bacon also made the soup a bit too salty so there was definitely no need to add more.

I guess I used too many big potatoes, because I ended up having to add an extra cup of cream and 3 more cups of water to my stock. Also used beef because I forgot to get chicken when I was at the store. Very tasty!

This was a hit with my friends and family tonight. Only differences were that I didn't have stock so used broth, and I had to use dried cilantro instead of fresh because of a shopping error (accidently grabbed parsley). Some issues: It takes WAY longer to prep than the recipe indicates, and next time I will hold the cooked bacon until the end and use more garlic and tarragon.

Very good. I had to do a little substituting because I live in the woods. I used turkey stock and subbed heavy cream with evaporated milk. No Cilantro on hand so subbed basil and parsley. My husband (the selective eater) even acknowledge that it was very good.

The is the ultimate of potato soups! I did omit the tarragon and cilantro, but added a bit of dried parsley instead. When serving it is great to add a bit of cheddar, chives and crumbled bacon on top.

This recipe is spot-on except for the tarragon and cilantro -- it doesn't need it. Garnishes are huge for this winner, I use bacon bits, tabasco, shredded cheese, green onions and sour cream. My favorite soup, I make it all the time.

I think I would add the bacon at the end. It was a little weird to have pureed bacon in the soup.  Also wasn't a huge fan of the teragon and cilantro combo.  Good, but I won't be making this recipe again.

Delicious soup! I used turkey bacon, so I actually added some coconut oil while cooking it to have enough 'drippings' for the celery and onions. I would also cook the bacon whole first next time, then crumble afterward, as cooking it cut up was a challenge. I also added a parsnip and a couple small carrots just for some extra veggies, and definitely some salt at the end. It tasted even better on the second day!

I have an aversion to the fennel/anise/licorice grouping of flavourings and my husband has the "hate cilantro" gene. But doctored up in other ways, the base recipe here was nice as a starting point. The potato bacon thing is always a good mix.

Delicious!! I will definitely make this soup. To reduce calories I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half.  The bacon gets soggy adding it back in with the potatoes. This is my only concern as to how to handle the bacon,  or use at all. Taste is personal,  I added chicken broth, white pepper to taste.

I am a soup aficionado and am very picky. I followed this recipe exactly. It was excellent. I'll be keeping this to make again and again. I DID season it with a lot of salt and pepper. If you are on a diet, don't bother making it - it's quite rich.

Just made this soup for my hubby and my lunch....it was wonderful!  It took awhile as it is now 2:56  but my husband said it was well worth the wait!   I did use chicken broth because that's what I had and put in more onion than called for because I think any potatoe soup needs a lot  of onion for the flavor to be good. I also grow my own cilantro and freeze it in ice cube trays. So that was one easy step. And I didn't had the bacon back in until I served it up in bowls and added shredded cheese on top too. Also served grilled cheese sandwiches with it , my husband likes to dip it in the creamy soup. A great tasting soup and will be making  it often . Thanks!!

This has potential to be great, but it is just too greasy and bacon filled.  The 2nd time I made it, I only used about 1/4 lb. of bacon, and it still was too greasy and the bacon flavor was too strong.  I might make it next time with no reserved bacon grease, or just change it to ham.  Adding a bit of sour cream did help the flavor a bit.

This was the best soup I've ever had. I didn't used a full onion, only about half of one. I only pur√©ed about 2-3 cups of soup, I had to add a lot of salt! This is delicous, I will make it again.

I made this and it was wonderful, although I did make some changes but not that much.  I omitted the cilantro, (mainly due to cilantro tasting like soap to me).  Used turkey bacon because it was all I had on hand, but used lard for that meaty flavoring, and added 5 slices of American cheese, and used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. It was very filling and amazingly good on a wet cold day.   Will remake again!

I thought it was a really delicious soup! I didn't like the way the bacon was cooked - it seemed somewhat chewy, but I could have made a mistake - and might avoid the bacon entirely next time. Still, it was super hearty! Very tasty! Probably not super healthy, but well worth it. It made for a great snowy evening dinner with the fam!

Made it exactly as recipe says, but added white pepper & black pepper and about half cup cheddar cheese into the soup when it was done. Topped with more cheese and green onion. 
It is delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I did make a few changes to this recipe but they where I feel small enough to give a proper review of the recipe. I left out onion and celery and added some grated carrot, (my fianc√© and nephew like to NOT eat veggies so hiding it was a must lol). Also I used different seasonings as I didn't have tarragon or cilantro on hand. how ever I did use the bacon grease as original recipe called for, even though I was nervous as numerous recipes stated that the bacon flavor was over powerful. I do not feel this is the case, it was excellent bacon flavor, I had no complaints neither did the other 3 adults and the teenager. we added shredded cheese on top and most went back for seconds!

I did not put tarragon. I think my measurements were a bit off. It ended up being rather thick.  While eating, there are some hard food bits that I fail to identify. I also did not puree the soup cause I do not exactly understand how to do that.

Not nearly as good as so many reviews suggest. It was good but not THAT good. And it took 3 hours from start to finish, not the 50 mins it suggested. It's very, very filling--honestly 1 cup would be enough. A whole bowl was more than anyone in my family of six could eat. This was a lot of work for the result. Honestly, kinda bummed.

this is a decent recipe but putting the bacon in at the end would probably be better because it gets soggy. we also used parsley instead of cilantro and added in some shredded cheddar cheese.

This is my go to recipe for potato soup. My family loves it. I always add carrots and sometimes diced ham or frozen corn just to change things up once in awhile. I also reserve some of the bacon to sprinkle on top along with sliced scallions when serving. Several members of the family add a few shakes of hot sauce on top, too. Yummy!! Serve it with garlic bread to sop up every last bit.

The soup was definitely quite tasty.  I did make a few adjustments though.  I used gluten-free flour instead of regular flour, half n half milk, and added in a few additional cloves of garlic because I like garlic.  I did notice that the soup came out extremely thick and creamy for my taste, so I will probably eliminate the flour altogether and maybe use regular whole milk next time.

This was the best soup. It takes a long time though so set aside plenty of time. It took my mom and I all day, but it was very worth it. 

I personally would substitute the heavy whipping cream for half and half  to have less of a sweet flavor. That's personal preference. 

Overall, amazing!!

I made this soup yesterday for lunch. I used ham instead of bacon and half and half instead of heavy cream. I also added one carrot. I used a potato masher a few times instead of pureeing 1/2 the soup. It was delicious!! This is now my go to potato soup. Mmmmm.....

I made it with chunks of ham and loved it, but I am sure bacon would give a similar flavor.

I added 16 oz. sour cream, used celery salt instead of celery stalk, didn't use cilantro, used Marjoram instead of Tarragon, used half the bacon, added ham, and grated cheese on top. Oh, and don't forget the Ritz cracker!

I've been making this for 3 years now and we all love it! I omitted the cilantro, added 1 cup shredded cheese at the end, and offered the bacon crumbles as a topping instead of mixing it in. I also use an immersion blender for about 4-5 bursts only. Soup is very thick and yummy!

Made it just like the directions said only I was lazy and didn't peal my potatoes.  So so good.  Lots of leftovers and for some reason those taste even better than the first night!  Will for sure cook again.

I loved this recipe . I tweaked it with leek and shredded carrots and it was a huge success . Simple to make BUT do not miss or change a step unless you are a pro cook . I believe next time . I might add organic chicken or sausage  for my carnivorous .

This is a great base recipe. Make it your own. I agree with another reviewer about adding the bacon last. Sometimes I add the bacon in at the end and sometimes I use it as  an edible garnish with chives. Definitely add some chicken base (paste) or bouillon in.

WOW! This soup was excellent. I was worried about it being bland, but that was not the case. We took out the tarragon and cilantro, but other than that, we made it almost exactly like the recipe.  My husband and children loved it and we made it on the night we had a big snow storm here in Wyoming. The stars aligned for this one! Perfect!

So good. Very thick, hearty soup. I took a lot of tips from other reviewers making it 5 stars after alterations.
-Add the bacon at the end
-Add shredded cheese at the end
-Do puree or hand mash a couple times

I also didn't add tarragon or cilantro. I didn't have any on hand. Tastes fantastic without. Be very careful with the cream mixture over heat so it doesn't separate. Just get it warm enough to melt, mix, and thicken. And my husband wished for some scallions to be added.

I made this recipe today,but tweaked it a bit . I used two strips of bacon and added about a pound of cubed honey ham. I added shredded carrots for some color and 2 cups of shredded cheddar as well. I skipped the cilantro altogether. It tastes Amazing!

Came out great! I'd only make a minor change. I'd save some of the bacon to use as a garnish and add a different texture (crunchiness) I also added some chopped scallion & a little shredded cheddar as a garnish.

1st review ever - with apologies to those purists who don't make changes before reviewing. This was the most delicious soup...fabulous. I had my own stock,  1/2 & 1/2 on hand, and cilantro makes me nauseous. Parsley is lovely for the freshness addition. Tarragon just slides in perfectly. Had to eat it right away, can't wait for a snowy night for the sure-to-be-better leftovers!!! THANK YOU

Really yummy, but next time I won't add the cooked bacon until just before serving.  I also needed to add a little more water while the potatoes were cooking.  A very hearty and delicious soup.

I made this for the second time today!  The first time, I made it exactly as instructed and I LOVED it.  This time I used leak in place of the onion and added fresh green beans and carrots ( just a few ) and again I LOVED IT.    THANKS for a great recipe!

I made this for dinner tonite and it was a big hit! I did step one and two this morning before I went to work, cooking the potatoes only for about 6 minutes (they were still crunchy). I stored it in the fridge until after work and put it back on the stove to boil. Step 3 went quickly so I suggest you have everything ready because before you know it dinner is done!!! Yum Yum!!

This soup is incredible.  It will be made again in my house.  We thought maybe more seasonings would be needed but we found out they were not necessary.  It is great just the way it is.  Prep time is longer than shown but well worth the effort.  I like Maggieok2 of adding a little shredded cheese at the end, or maybe just put it top of the soup in the bowl.

i made this soup today and it was a hit with my soup picky husband. i followed the recipe with just a few changes as i wanted to make it using what i had on hand, so instead of the 1/2&1/2 cream i used 2% milk and to boost the flavour i added 1 tbsp of sour cream, this in my opinion made it a bit too rich so note to self use only the milk. i  used parsley instead of the cilantro and used (Better than Bouillon chicken base) instead of chicken stock.. i  feel that 1 lb of bacon was a bit much so next time i will only use 2/3rds lb. for colour and nutrition i added 1 cup frozen peas. will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious! I reduced the bacon and added Fennel seeds. Also skipped the Tarragon as I didn't have any, added fresh parsley instead of Cilantro. The biggest thing for me was resisting the urge to tweak, which I do routinely, and I was concerned that it might be a little bland. I was wrong. Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I made this and a bacon, leek and potato soup at the same time.  So far, this one is my favorite between the two.  

I took a few liberties with the recipe, such as using replacing the butter line with an approximately 50/50 mix of butter and chilled bacon drippings.  I used a stick blender to blend the entire mixture instead of the 50% that the recipe called for.  I also used a combination of red potatoes and russet potatoes while making this; using 2 red potatoes are approximately 1 russet as a rough conversion factor. 

I think the cream+rue step is a strong part of what makes this recipe so darn yummy.

We love this recipe, but of course we change it around a little bit. Its only me and my wife so we decrease the amount of potatoes down to 2 small ones or 1 large one. We use a 32oz container of chicken broth and add carrots to the vegetables being saut√©ed in the bacon grease. a nice easy recipe!

Please take the time to read reviews!! If I had not I wouldn't have known the difference between, 'stock', and 'broth'. This soup is amazing!! My family could not stop eating it!
I don't leave low ratings on recipes due to the fact that there is the chance that it was me that did something wrong! I cook so much and have repeatedly used broth and ended up disappointed with flavorless results. 
For the stock I used a combo of beef, pork, and roasted chicken bones. I threw in some carrots, onions, and celery and let it simmer for about 5 hrs. That on its own tasted amazing!
Like another reviewer said, I too added leeks. For the bacon I chose apple smoked. It was delicious :-)

This made a very good meal for a cold day.   We added 3 teaspoons of Onion Salt because we thought it was a little bland for our tastes and I think a little shredded cheese might be a good idea.   We made it without the cheese and enjoyed it very much.

Used chicken broth as opposed to stock and turned out well (considering the other reviews). Added three carrots thinly sliced.  Added 1/2 tbsp of dried parsley and used 2 tsp of coriander as opposed to 3 tsp of fresh cilantro. Don't skip out on the tarragon - it's a must! A rich hearty winter soup.

This is very good, not sure if it needed the cilantro... Also adding a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar to the top when serving it makes it better!

Just made this but with a twist... used grass fed butter to replace bacon fat and made a cashew/coconut milk to substitute for the heavy cream and some Himalayan sea salt. So good!!

My mother created extraordinarily good soups -- and I loved her potato soup; however, this soup is so rich, creamy and just plain delicious that I will be using this recipe from now on!  It seems like a perfect blend of just the right ingredients! :-)

Delicious! Made this soup last night (and will make again, and again). ***3 Alterations: I used 5 large peeled russet potatoes instead of the red, as it was all I had in the house. And I added 2 large unpeeled chopped carrots. I also did not use blender to puree but used potato masher a few seconds to do the job. Less mess. Also, a word about using the Dutch Oven (I have a La Creuset): when cooking up the bacon, the bottom of the pan will get some heavy browning. THIS IS GOOD and expected. When the veggies go in, that will lift off and add TONS of bacon flavoring. CHANGES FOR NEXT TIME: I'll most likely not use heavy cream; maybe half-n-half or whole milk or maybe no milk at all! Lastly: make sure you use chicken STOCK NOT BROTH!!! Broth has much less flavor and depth.

This is pretty good. I made 4 servings so reduced the recipe to 3 strips of bacons, 5 potatoes and substituted heavy cream with sour cream (1/2 cup) and a pinch of ground oregano in lieu of cilantro. I accidentally added 1/2 and not 1/4 cup of flour which made the cream balled up and chunky. I mitigated this problem by putting it through the blender which rendered it a nice, creamy texture. The soup turned out beautifully.

As written, I'm giving this 3 stars. It is a great base recipe, but very bland as written.  After 5 of us sampled the soup, we agreed that it definitely needed more flavor. I added a lot of garlic,  some garlic salt, some kosher salt, black pepper, and an extra 1/2 onion and 4 more stalks of celery.  I also added extra tarragon and cilantro. Basically, I just kept taste testing until I felt the flavor fit my family!  After the adjustments made, my son told me "this soup is just TOO good!"

Totally freakin awesome. Yes a little bit of work but well worth it. Followed exact recipe and loved it. I was thrown a little back when it said take half the soup and puree but, that is what makes the soup nice and thick. Will definitely make this one again and again. Totally blows my old potato soup out of the water. Ok not totally but is much better.

Super delicious eats-like-a-meal soup! It's an absolutely perfect dish for a chilly fall day! I didn't change much, except all I had on hand was whipping cream so it was soooo thick and rich!!! But really, I can't complain about that!! Amazing recipe - definitely a favourite!

Excellent soup.  I used one large garlic clove and left out the other seasoning, except for salt and pepper.  It tasted good without, but was even better with some shredded cheese stirred into it.

This was delicious.  However, I made the soup a bit more heart healthy.  I poured off all the bacon grease and then put in 2 tbsp of coconut oil to saute the onions and celery.  I used 5 large red potatoes and didn't peel them.  For the roux, I substituted grapeseed oil instead of butter and then added 1 cup of coconut milk instead of cream.  I chopped up fresh tarragon and used dried cilantro since I didn't have any!  I'll have to make sure the cilantro is fresh next time.  My husband loved it!  It's a keeper.

Used bezel instead of cilantro, worked out great! No puree at the end. Potatoes with skins were cooked perfect, I'm not a regular cook who tries new receipts but this was excellent.

My husband and two boys loved this soup.  Made a few changes based on other reviews:  1) Added extra spices  2) Used milk instead of heavy cream  3) Added leeks  4) Added about two Tbsp of cream cheese at the end. 

Perfect soup for a cold night. I will make this again!

Just amazing! So rich and creamy. Hands down the best potato soup I've had. Substitutions made to avoid a trip to the store: .6 lbs of Bacon (all I had left), 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning in place of Tarragon, Celery salt in place of Celery, Half and Half instead of Cream, 3 lbs of red potatoes. Not having made this before I can't say for certain, but it definitely didn't seem to suffer for the alterations. These changes dropped the calorie count to ~ 450 / 10 oz serving (80 oz total). Start to finish was 90 minutes for my first time (including clean up).

I followed the recipe exactly except used turkey bacon and leek because that's what I had on hand.  This turns out a very thick soup which we liked on a cold and windy day, but you could easily add some milk to thin it if you want.  I thought the seasonings were perfect but I think it largely has to do with what kind of chicken broth you are using (I use a jarred paste).  The tarragon and cilantro combination really made this soup! Would love to try adding broccoli and/or cauliflower next time and maybe some cheese at the end.  Lots of possibilities with this one!

I made this soup yesterday and it was delicious! Like something from a gourmet restaurant. I used chicken broth as directed. I didn't use celery or cilantro because I didn't have it on hand. I used  Butter Red potatoes and didn't peel them.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe called for. This is a keeper! Never tasted any better potato soup anywhere! I garnished it with grated cheddar cheese.

It was the best!  I used mostly unpeeled red potatoes and a couple of russets.  The butter and cream make it really rich and filling.  It is now my "go to" potato soup and I've been making potato soup for at least forty years!!

I have been making this for years.  Mine varies from this recipe. I use corn instead of celery and I also use cumin instead of tarragon.  And I must admit I use 50% more bacon. Mmmmmm bring on the coronary.

An amazing way to warm up a Winter day!
Great texture - instead of blending the soup I used a potato masher - great result!
Also added broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower to make it a meal soup - Was a bit thick so threw in a splash of dry white wine..........Wow - fantastic!

I myself am not a potato soup fan, but my husband loves it, so I found this recipe and he loved it. I have to say I am becoming more of a fan as well. I followed the recipe almost to a "T", the only changes I made was I threw half of the bacon in when it called for it, I only pureed three ladles full of soup, added that to the pot and then the remaining bacon, so I had a little crunch to it! So very tasty!

Super good! Kids loved it. I did add sliced carrots and used 2 stalks bok choy instead of celery (didn't have it on hand). Used regular russet potatoes peeled and came out scrumptious. Will make it over and over.

I make this kind of soup all the time for my family. I use  low fat can milk instead of the half and half. I also add green onion and no garlic. I mash up a few of the potatoes to make the soup a little thicker. Other than that it was good. After it is cooked I add crumbled up bacon and cheese to top it.

I tried it the way it is described, then made my mothers receipt which has the following changes: instead of doing the butter, cream ect. in a different pot, bring all together as soon as the potatoes added (i don't peel them) then i puree everything with a imersion blender. I also add carrots to the soup and 1 stalk of leek as well as a tough of grated muscat nut on the end.

I made this for a party tonight for 12 people along with other food. Everyone loved it! I even had a 5 year old take time to thank me for the delicious soup and said he loved it. I followed the recipe just like it was listed, except for the flour. It didn't need the flour and I didn't have to pur√©e any of it because it was thick enough.

This recipe turned out really well! It works just as well without pureeing the soup. I prefer my soups chunky so I skipped that step. The result was a hearty delicious meal that I shared with friends.

I will make this again. I took one reviewers advice, left out half the bacon, until ready to serve. That way, you taste more bacon. I also wanted my soup a little thinner, so used 32 oz of chicken broth, & about a cup of milk. I think it would be better with the garlic, but hubby's on a mild, low spice diet.

Soup was nice and simple to make and ended up tasting pretty good. I personally thought it had a very strong bacon taste and even thought in the beginning about only using half a pound of bacon but ended up just following the recipe. Still a very good tasting soup and easy to make.

Followed the recipe to a T. It tastes like chicken. Is the chicken stock just too much or did I do something wrong?

This is fantastic! I used 6 Yukon Gold potatoes. I also did not have tarragon or fresh cilantro so I used dill and Parsley. At the end I also added shredded cheddar cheese about 1 cup. It was tasty and easy to make.

My family loved it. Even my husband, who is a MEAT and potatoes kind of guy. Only thing I changed was, I left out the tarragon and cilantro. I'll try it next time with the tarragon. And skip the puree, part. Using a hand masher or fork works just fine.

I mad a few changes to my personal liking. After reading reviews I opted out on the flour rue and celery because my husband doesn't like celery. I tossed the potatoes in the bacon grease, bacon, onion and garlic then separated the potatoes half I kept in the pan cooked with chicken stock and pur√©ed when soft. I used that as my "rue" then combined with the cubed potatoes. 
I diced Mozerrella with Artichoke & Garlic Sausage and  apple & Gouda cheese sausage really small and added that to the soup along with chopped bacon. Before serving I added some shredded cheese to the soup itself. 
The only additional spices I added was white pepper  and cayenne.  Topped with bacon, cheese and green onion. 
My version is definitely not for those counting calories but boy was it scrumptious. Served with French and Sourdough bread. 
Great recipe to do so many yummy things with.

I saw some were disappointed that it came out too thin‚Ä¶ Just a little trick I have when my potato soup comes out too thin...  I just add a few instant potato flakes and voila' !  I loved it! Just replaced carrots for celery and added crispy bacon on top when serving!

I loved it... I did add some dill (love this in soups), didn't have any cilantro, also added a little parsley flakes.
I added some chopped broccoli, could use less bacon, and want to use butter instead of the bacon grease next time. Oh yes, I did not use any salt or pepper and used unsalted butter when I made the flour mixture. Also, did not use heavy cream, used 2% milk and it was creamy enough.
IT WAS DELICIOUS!

This was the best soup I've made yet! I love the bacon grease instead of butter, it just gives it so much more flavor. If you are doing bacon anyways, don't use butter there! It's just not the same. Very good, will make again and play around with spices :)

I'll give the original recipe four stars. However, if you toss in some shredded smoked gouda (a cup or two depending on how much you like cheese), it would definitely be a five star recipe. :)

Okay -- I did make changes.  Don't hate me.  I didn't have tarragon or cilantro, so used poultry seasoning.  I used homemade vegetable stock that I made with the tops and bottoms of cut veggies (and veggies just about to go bad in the fridge). And added, because I needed to use it, a 1-lb cut up block of Velveeta.  I think, though, that without the changes, the recipe would have been just awesome.  

Thanks for a great recipe.

I will make it again. Didn't need to puree or blend, also needed to adjust/add seasoning to my preference, didn't use bacon grease, kept bacon separate from soup and just used it chopped up as a topping with green onion and sprinkled cheese, didn't think mixing bacon in soup was a good idea bc it would get soggy, also stirred in a bit of Velveeta cheese at the end, otherwise that it's a great comfort food recipe.

This is absolutely delicious. I cooked the potatoes with a ham hock and added the bacon and cheese at the very end. It was very thick but  tasty!  My husband raved about it.  Any cheese would do but I added cheddar.

Nom Nom. Made it as instructed, was missing tarragon so I replaced with 1/8 tsp of anise powder and teaspoon of dried basil. Do not forget to salt and pepper to your liking at the end.

Fabulous soup!  I've made it several times and it is delicious w/o any adjustments.  I add an additional onion, a bit more garlic, white pepper and top it with grated cheddar.  Old fashioned YUM!  Thank you for a now family favorite!

My entire family loved this recipe.  I doubled it because we have 3 teenagers AND love leftovers.  I did not double the bacon; I did 15 slices which was a little over 1 lb.  I used butter instead of bacon grease to saut√© the onions and celery.  Left the skin on the potatoes and used garlic powder b/c I don't like to crush garlic.  YUMMY!!!!  I will save and make again for sure.

This was my first time making potato soup from scratch. I used less bacon then it called for but everthing else was the same. I think it tastes wonderful. Thank you for sharing.

This was delicious. I made a few modifications -- for example I waited to add the the bacon as the last step. I agree that it takes much longer to prepare than stated in the recipe. Will definitely make it again!!

I've never made potato soup and was nervous. This was just incredible. So easy and amazing. Very picky husband and he loved it. I let it simmer for about an hour to let it develop more and beefed up the spices a little based on reviews. I added a little chicken bullion to give more flavor. After it cooked for an hour, I wished I would have waited to add the bullion. A little salty, but we never cook with salt so that's just our preference. Well done! Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.

This turned out really well...not a dropped left.  I did two things different...I used my SLOW COOKER so that we could have hot soup after a chilly softball practice after school...and this fit the bill.  I did step 2 and put it all in a slow cooker on low for 5 hours.  Instead of using bacon that I needed to pan fry, I bought  Hormel Black Label Bacon Bits...I would not use anything else as a substitute and added 1/2 the little jar to the soup.  After softball I whipped step 3 up on the stove and put it in the slow cooker and let simmer for 10 minutes.  As another  reader suggested I just used my masher and mashed it about 5 times and it turned out perfect.

Like another reviewer mentioned, I waited until the soup was done before adding the bacon back to it. And I grabbed chicken broth, not stock, not sure how big of a difference it really makes, as the soup was still really rich and creamy. But I wish I hadnt pureed half the soup, and just left it whole. I understand its a potato soup, but its almost too potato-ey for me. Took me about an hour, as I was chopping and peeling as I went along.

Delicious. It tasted just like if it were from a restaurant. My family ate it up! The only thing I did differently was that I cut three bacon pieces up using kitchen scissors and added them to the soup, and used the rest for topping. Serve with cheese and green onion and it's perfect.

Took longer cook time than expected but excellent recipe.  I sliced the potatoes into halves or quarters and microwaved them for a few minutes to reduce the cook time.  I added a little minced poblano pepper at the same time as the onion to add more flavor, but couldn't taste it  (next time will add more), and some parsley with the cilantro.  The cream mixture took a long to to thicken with a hand whisk.  Used an immersion blender instead of a blender to puree (left in some chunky bits), and ending up adding some extra chicken stock because it was so thick.  Served it with sweet sausage.   My son adding more garlic, some sour cream and cheese to his to give it a "loaded baked potato" flavor.  I ate mine straight.  It was yummy both ways.   This recipe is a keeper.

Love this! I didn't add the bacon to the soup with the potatoes, i waited until serving and added it to the top of each bowl. I also used chicken broth because i couldn't find stock, seemed to not make a difference to me, just added a little more salt. Also added one chicken bouillon cube for more flavor. Also added pepper because i love pepper!

Great recipe. I made it vegetarian by using vegetable stock and omitting the bacon. I've also used almond milk but prefer regular milk or cream.

This soup was wonderful!!! The only thing I changed was that I added chopped fresh mushrooms when I saluted the onions and celery.   The consistency was great and the taste was wonderful. Once we added cheese and bacon bits it was perfect!

this soup was great- made a big huge pot of it for my boyfriend, housemates and myself. it was very rich- me and my boyfriend love dairy but don't react well to it. I personally would've added more broth in replacement to cream. Added a little bit of white vinegar to the soup as my family always has to cut the creaminess. Kept very well in the fridge too!

Excellent soup! Easy to make GF with changing out the flour. I added two large carrots, chopped, and did half red skin potatoes with skins on and half russet potatoes with skins off. Used a masher instead of blending part of it and it worked great while saving a lot of clean up.

Perfect! I made this but had no tarragon or cilantro on hand. It was still delicious! It is really good with a little shredded cheddar on it too. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I added 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese at the end to make a delicious cheesy potato soup.

I used 3 bags of 'Simply Potatoes' (I dislike chopping potatoes and they are basically just diced potatoes with a bit of onion), 6 cups broth and doubled the butter/flour/cream mixtures. Added a cup of Shaved Parmesan. Really fabulous.

Love this potato soup! I really like that I can change up the flavor by just using a different bacon such as applewood smoked or extra peppery - totally different flavors with a vey simple substiution.

Very delicious, I made a double batch for family and there's barely any left! I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth and I put the bacon in afterwards so the bacon wouldn't get TOO soggy. When I served it, I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top! Perfection in a bowl! I didn't need to puree the soup either.

I love this potato soup and I love recipes with photos and this one has 54 photos.  My question is, Why does the soup vary in color? Mine came out white and creamy...some are orange and even darker looking? Could it be the bacon?  Other than that I think one pound of back is a bit much but to each his own...

Not sure what recipe Crystal followed but this soup is to die for!!!!!  I did add a little sour creme and about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese at the end of the cooking time.  I also did the cooking in a crock pot.  It saved me a lot of precious time as almost all of the ingredients were put in the crock at the beginning of prep.  The potatoes did not even need to be mashed/pureed.  I made not one but two crock pots of this soup for my Super Bowl party and didn't even get to keep a bowl for myself as the guests took it all home with them.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I did bacon as directed, but then when I cooked the celery and onion I added in the garlic and other spices and also added in the potato's to make them cook more quickly.  It made it have a unique blend and made the soup even better in my family's opinions.

Not bad! Wouldn't call it stellar but pretty good! I halved the recipe and substituted a leek for the onion, just to use it up. I didn't have tarragon or cilantro so used about 1/2tsp of italian seasoning, and blended with an immersion blender but left some chunks. Would probably try again and follow to the T to see if it makes a difference.

The cilantro gave this a nice twist, and it was a delicious,  easy soup.  I did serve topped with cheese. The only issue I had was my fault,  I wasn'twatching the potatoes closely enough and I overcooked . When I went to puree, the soup came out a  little runny. I'll watch more carefully next time,  but therewill ddefinitely be a next time.

I am not much of a soup guy, but this recipe was indeed absolutely delicious! We are trying to cut cholesterol so we used turkey bacon, subbed half & half for the heavy cream, and used butter flavored Crisco instead of real butter. We used red taters too... Might use just a tiny bit less tarragon next time. There WILL be a next time!

I loved this soup! I did not add tarragon or cilantro. Used fresh thyme and Italian parsley and it was delish! Just made it again today and added carrots when I sauted the onions and then 3 chicken breasts I had boiled with celery and green onion at the end. Shredded them first. Yum! Waiting for my biscuits!

It was a very god recipe. It did lack a bit of seasoning, so I added more salt and pepper once it was in my bowl. It did however give me and my husband gas and I'm not exactly sure why.

It's awesome!! I was able to lighten it up a bit.  I used half and half( fat free) and fat free/lactose free milk, turkey bacon and Smart Balance butter.  You can make it healthier by using Heart Healthy Bisquick, but I did not have that, so I used flour.

I am very happy having chosen this recipe. I did not use the tarragon or cilantro as my family does not like these. The time it takes [mentioned already] is longer than stated but not super long. I also took out about two cups to use a hand masher to mush it up a bit and then back into pot. I also did not need [or use]the flour. I agree and did put the bacon on last and cheddar cheese on top at the end. I also used half and half. [ I am miss pudge already] As someone said earlier [and I will use next time as this sounds good] sprinkle green onion at the end. Thanks go to Karena

I've been using this recipe for a few years now, it's the best one I have tried. The only things I do different is I don't use the tarragon  or cilantro but add about 4 Oz of cheddar cheese. It is the best soup.

When hubby says "it's a keeper" then I know I have found something really good! The video really helped, as well as the reviews, which I always read. And when I read MaggieOK2's review who stated: "The puree step near the end is very important. It highly affected the texture and flavor of the soup. Don't skip that step!" I made sure I did this step and she is right! I didn't have tarragon, so used Dill per the video and added salt and pepper to taste. It has a great smokey flavor to it thanks to the bacon. I normally make a potato cream cheese soup, but this may skip past it! As with all recipes, you can always season to taste!

I dearly love potato soup! The changes I would make to this soup would be to add a lot more celery and onion. You can't put too much celery or onion into potato soup! I'd leave out the tarragon and cilantro, it's not needed. At the end, melt in a cup or two of your favorite shredded cheese. Instead of a cup of heavy cream, add a quart of half and half.  I use instant potatoes to thicken the soup and leave out the step for making a thickening. Throw in the crispy bacon last for a delicious crunch and you have a potato soup straight from heaven!

I made this recipe vegan by taking out the bacon adding corn and using (unsweetened) coconut milk and vegan butter instead of cream and real butter. I also added fresh parsley and green onion on top.
It was VERY delicious and WAY healthier!!

An super recipe - one of the best for an excellent soup in its own right, or as a base for the more adventuresome. I've done this with sour cream, varied the herbs a bit (try some dill or oregano), used vegetable stock rather than chicken, etc. You can experiment without ruining this one! But if you just put this soup in front of your guests, you'll garner lots of ooohs and aaahs.

I thought this recipe was very good, with the exception of the tarragon. I thought it was overpowering. I may make it again, but I would substitute fresh thyme for the tarragon. I also added a splash of sherry at end.

Just made this soup, and its a hit! My husband said "you had me at the name", and it really lives up to it. I "lightened" it a bit by not using the full pound of bacon, and leaving very little bacon grease in the pan to saut√© the onions and celery, and using milk instead of cream at the then, but it was still awesome! Its the first time I have ever had potato soup that I liked. We are going to try it next time by adding some shrimp, it has a great chowder flavor. Also used chives instead of cilantro because that was what I had fresh in the garden, and it was dee-lish!

Just finished my first pot of this recipe, following it exactly as written, although have not pur√©ed the half of  it yet, and may not since the cream addition made the broth thick and substantial.  Husband, a real potato lover said it was "good, not great."  I liked it about 4 stars worth, and averaged the two ratings to 3 stars .  Because of the very high fat content, may not make it more than once a year, however!  Probably the fattiest, richest, soup I've ever made, but nice balance of flavors within it.  Do not feel it needs cheese as a topping, but maybe a few scallions to "pretty" it up.

I made this for the first time and loved it!  Thanks for the suggestion to cook the bacon and crumble in on top of the soup, instead of cooking it in the soup.  I did change it a little.  I used kale instead of cilantro.  YUM!!

Really good but did not use bacon fat!  Cooked bacon and drained off as much far as I could.  Did not use heavy cream but used 1/2 and 1/2.  Otherwise this recipe would have been very unhealthy.  Other than that, it was awesome and we'll make it again.

Followed recipe exactly and whole family loved it. Next time I will make it a day ahead. Left overs the next day  were even better! Only problem I have with the recipe is that it says prep time is 10 min. I know I work slow but I would like to see anyone do all that peeling and chopping in 10 min.

I like the consistency but I agree with JHarmon40 that the bacon should be added at the end and not cooked with the potatoes.  The cilantro was a bit overpowering also, so next time I may half the amount.

I liked this soup.  Did not have leeks.  Will add them next time.  Added 1/4 tsp of dried red pepper.  Also a little chicken granules.  Took. About two hours start to finish.  I will add the bacon, right before the cream mixture, next time. Was soggy, did not like that.

Loved the recipe, switched a few things up. I used 1/2 tsp of thyme and 1/2 oregano instead of majorum. Also added a 1/2cup of white wine while simmering with chicken stock, also added 4 drops of liquid smoke to the mix. Skipped the cilantro. After I bowled the soup up, I put 2 tbs shredded cheddar, 1 tbs green onion, and 1 tbs crumbled bacon, and a small drizzle of hot sauce on top. Awesome! Make sure to crumble the bacon before you toss it with the cooking potatoes.

Outstanding soup, good flavor, nice balance. We offer one cautionary note, as cooks with 30+ years of experience: the time estimate for food preparation was not even close for us: it took an hour plus cook time. On a weekend it was not a problem, but this is not a quickie recipe. And we will most certainly make it again, many times.

I thought like another commentor that it lacked flavor.  I omitted the terragan, cilantro and garlic because it just didn't sound good in potato soup.  However, I added a lb. of carrots, corn, a can of beer and more potatoes than the recipe called for along with salt and pepper.  I added just a little bit bacon grease to the pot from my baking sheet for health reasons.  I saut√©ed my onion and celery in a bit of olive oil.  I also had to add a lot of thickener at the end.  I did not puree but just mashed everything in the pot a couple of times.  I also did not want mushy bacon in my soup - yuck.  I baked my bacon and set it aside for crumbles on top along with shredded cheddar colby jack cheese and fresh parsley to dress it up in the bowl.  The family liked it.

This was delicious! I stuck with the recipe pretty mych exactly (only omitted the cilantro because my husband doesn't like it and didn't puree half at the end because everyone was ready to eat and it was great without). My daughter thought of sprinkling shredded cheese on top and was glad she did, yummy!  He and my daughter had 2 bowls! Definitely will do this again.

One of the better potato soup recipes I've tried. Took a lot longer than 40 minutes to make. Fair amount of prep work.

I will try to lighten this up for future batches. I made it for a high calorie dinner for my underweight son.

The only change I made was subsitituing rutabagas for potatoes. It was awful. We couldn't get past that bacon grease flavor. It tastes like veggies in bacon grease.

Today is May 13, 2014 and I'm looking out at snow here in the Central mountains of New Mexico.  Had a few Golden Yukon potatoes that needed cooking and so I picked this recipe for a not quite spring yet bit if comfort.  I followed the recipe as posted but halved the amount of bacon and augmented the grease with olive oil to bring to measure.  Pretty easy to follow and delicious to eat.  Pair with a bottle of Bass beer, a chunky corner of bread and snuggle in.  Tomorrow it's supposed to be 75!

I made this recipe for Mother's Day for the first time, and it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect. Make sure and add enough salt and pepper to it, as it will taste a bit bland if not added. People in my family who usually do not like soup loved it, which was a big deal! This soup goes perfectly with homemade rolls, like the "quick yeast rolls" which I made to go with it! I would recommend this recipe to anyone, cold or hot weather!

This is by far the best potato soup I have tried. However I did try to lighten it up a bit as my family is use to eating lower fat/salt foods. I used half and half instead of cream , reduced salt bacon and margarine instead of butter. Even my picky four year old will eat this and ask for seconds!

Fantastic soup, quite thick so great comfort food for those cold days.  I did not have cilantro so unfortunately had to skip, I added a couple of shakes of dry marjoram leaves. Will definitely make again, will try the cilantro next time.  One member in our family does not like thick soups, we added heated milk at time of serving.

First I read all of the reviews. Instead of onion I used a Leek.(first time I ever used one) I used chicken broth but I did add 2 packets of Swanson Chicken Flavor Boost. I used parsley instead of cilantro and tarragon. I did feel this could use a little more flavor (that's why I only gave it 4 stars) so I'm wondering if the tarragon and cilantro would have been good in the mixture. I crumbled up the bacon right before serving and put into the soup. I left some reserve for topping the soup in our bowls plus I sprinkled shredded cheese and sliced green onion, so good! The green onion gave it a little more flavor. I did not puree it, I didn't feel it needed it. My 11 yr old only added more crumbled bacon to the top of his and he LOVED it! He's very picky. He's the reason I made this soup, he loves potato soup! I will definitely make this again.

Wow! Now that is great potato soup! Absolutely loved what the tarragon did for the flavor. Just wish someone would be more specific...at least giving me a starter for how much salt. It's the one ingredient that I'm the most afraid of, but felt was needed.

Made this soup today.  WOW!!!  My only complaint is the roux makes the soup very thick after I pur√©ed half of it.  My culinary student daughter suggested doubling the cream next time.  The only change I made was to omit the cilantro as I don't care for that herb...I added dried marjoram instead and it was wonderful!  I also added salt and pepper at the end.  Upon serving we put a dollop of sour cream and some shredded Mexican cheese.  My family declared it a winner.

The name of this soup is perfectly accurate - it IS absolutely ultimate!  I have made this recipe several times now, always as-is, and everyone I have made it for raves about it.  It will be my go-to potato soup recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing!

I really loved this, and my picky kids liked it.  The only change I would make is that next time I will add some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it.  Also, I didn't measure the thyme (my fault) so the thyme flavor was a little strong.  Overall, a great recipe that I will use again this week.

I combined this with several other potato soup recipes and made it my own, but this was the best one I found and the recipe I followed most closely. I didn't have that much bacon and I had no celery, but I added some green peppers finely chopped which did help. I substituted half milk half/sour cream for heavy cream and it turned out well. I let it simmer and reduce a bit until it got to desired thickness. I still found it to be a bit brothy, so I slightly mashed it with a potato masher. This really helped thicken it up and add to the creaminess! Very good!

Made this tonight. We loved it. It can be a little bland but I add hot sauce to mine so I didn't notice it much. I will be making this again.

I made the mistake of cutting the recipe in half because only my daughter and I were home and I thought 8 servings would be too much.....HUGE MISTAKE!!!! This soup is AWESOME. However, I used ham cubes instead of bacon and leeks in place of the onions.  The soup was full of flavor and my daughter and I are fighting over the last bowl! Will definitely cook it again!

Not sure what I did wrong here. I followed the recipe exactly when it came to making the cream mixture. I had to make it 3 times before it came out right. The first two times I made the mixture it came out clumpy and like dough no matter how much I stirred. The final 3rd time I added milk and took the pan off the heat. I threw in the bacon and kept adding milk while stirring like crazy. It finally came out right so I just added the potatoes as I had way too many and mixed it together while simmering. Flavors were good. However I doubt I will be making this again.

Currently eating this with kids.soup is very thin, even after making and extra rue, and my soup turned very brown. It has a decent flavor, but won't re make this dish again. There are better and faster versions of this soup. This took an hour and a half to make, not the quick fourty minute dish I thought it would be

This soup was excellent! Perfect comfort food when paired with a crusty French bread. I think it would be great with other vegetables added to it or ham or kielbasa. No need to pur√©e at the end-just a potato masher will do the job. Thank you for am excellent recipe!

Amazing recipe! I substituted thinly sliced stew beef for the bacon and saut√©ed the onions, celery, garlic, and beef in about 1/8 cup of evoo. The rest of the recipe I left as is and this is by far one of the best potato soups I have ever tasted! Thank you!

This soup turned out delicious! I had to make two modifications based on what I had on hand. I didn't have any bacon so I used a 1/4 cup butter in place of the bacon grease. I only had skim milk so I used that instead of heavy cream. I was fully prepared to add some sour cream in at the end for some extra creaminess but it really didn't need it so I didn't. I loved the flavor of the tarragon in this soup. If it's this delicious without bacon and heavy cream I know it's gotta be amazing with them, so next time I will make this exactly as written for a treat. Thanks for this great recipe.

Such a great and easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was adding a gravy mix instead of chicken broth (was out of Knors!)I normally use full cream in my soup but there was none in  the market so I just used the partially skimmed milk that was available and the soup was still incredibly creamy and thick! Love it so much it will become a regular for our family.

I really liked this recipe and it makes for a great starter that allows you to experiment a little. I used basil instead of tarragon, which I really liked and I also added green onions and fresh shredded pepper jack cheese at the end. The green onion did a little bit for presentation, but I liked the pepper jack cheese, because a there were a few bites that would have a little kick. I also added cooked bacon before adding the cream mixture and some more after adding the cream mixture. I would recommend adding it at the end, because the bacon doesn't have as much flavor after sitting in with everything else for so long.

I also did not use a blender, because i don't have one, so I just mashed them with a spatula (also don't have a potato masher) and though the potatoes weren't mashed entirely, I got the texture that I wanted. I don't see any need to add salt because I used chicken broth. Overall, was really pleased with this recipe and will definitely be making this again.

This is a great soup and wasn't to difficult to make. The adjustment I mad was using ham instead of bacon. Cooking the vegetables in Olive oil. Great idea to pur√©e half of the soup this really made it great!

I made this tonight, really good soup.  I didn't change one ingredient other than using my own homemade **chicken stock.  I cooked it longer than it says because I think longer cooking develops more flavor.  Half an hour before I was ready to serve I added the *butter/flour/cream mixture and half of the bacon.  I reserved the rest for garnish.

*I used light cream that I use for my coffee.  The grocery store was completely out of heavy cream.  Turned out fine.  Half & Half would probably work as well.

**I use Ina Garten's recipe for chicken stock but I do not use 3 whole chickens.  I use chicken backs and necks that equal about 3 lbs and any remaining bones from roasting, rotisserie etc, (just toss bones in a ziplock bag and freeze them until you're ready for stock day!)  It's amazing and yields about 6 quarts of stock.  I use it regularly and I'll never buy store bought chicken "broth" again.

I used this as a base......Followed everything, except, flour, butter, cream and colantro just to keep it healthier! I loved this version.
Also, put some in a blender in the end to cream. Delicious! and the tarragon was great! unique, distinct flavor. You can play around with this recipe easily.

i made it last night but i had to leave out the onions cause they give me awful headaches. i think it would have been better without the tarragon which gave it an unusual taste for potato soup. Next time i make i would leave out the tarragon. however some people maybe like like tarragon i don't cook with it so maybe thats why i don' t care for this potato soup.

best potato soup recipe ever!  substituted marjoram for tarragon as i couldn't find tarragon in the store. my husband and i are those "soapy" cilantro people so we left that out too.  i prefer to use ham stock instead of chicken stock and it's AMAZING!!!

Very good recipe!! I tweaked it to taste like Karena says to do! I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cilantro and tarragon. I then added 1 teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder. 1 1/2 teaspoon of chives and salt. I also added a bay leaf  to the simmering potaotes. Then an extra 1/2 cup of whipped cream! I found it necessary to puree 4 cups of the soup for thickness!! Took die for!!!!

We loooved this recipe! I did not put the celery, onion or cilantro in as we do not like them in our house.  But I fried the bacon and added mushrooms and threw everything together and put it in the crock pot for 4 1/2 hours.  Turned out AMAZING!

"You should make this all the time!" "Can I take some home with me?" No higher praise from my girls. Didn't have any bacon, (sauteed with butter instead - but will use next time), tarragon or cilantro. Added finely diced carrots. Used gluten-free bullion instead of stock. Added shredded sharp cheddar cheese after serving. It was creamy, hearty, and will become one of my go-to recipes. Thanks!

I made this soup with a few changes. I used garlic powder instead, left out the cilantro and tarragon, mainly because I didn't have any ;) using parsley, celery seed and salt/pepper was a plus. I didn't have any stock so I used chicken broth and added hard boiled eggs (diced). My family complained because there was not enough! I left the crumbled bacon to the side, adding as a topping in each serving, it remained crunchy and it was amazing! I will most definitely be making this again! There were only 5 stars or I would have rated this higher!!

This soup was absolutely delicious. I didn't have tarragon, and I used one or two potatoes too many, which made it too thick. I thinned it out with some milk. It is to die for. Really really enjoyed it. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe!

Excellent soup! But it does not take 40 minutes. It takes about 2 hours start to finish. I did not add cilantro (my taste), but I did sprinkle chopped fresh chives and some of the bacon over the finished soup. Delicious!

So Yummy!! Tried this for the first time tonight and my entire family consumed two big bowls.  I followed directions, except i added a titch more fresh cilantro than it called for. :)  I used quite a bit of salt to season to taste.  Consistency was perfect after blending 1/2 the soup and adding it back in the pot.  Totally recommend this recipe and will be making it again!!

First time making potato soup and this recipe is fabulous!!!  Omitted cilantro just based on personal preference. Labor intensive, took about 2.5 hrs start to finish but definitely worth it. My 5 year old daughter loves it too! Thanks for the great recipe.

Very delicious!  Instead of real bacon, I used the pre-cooked packaged stuff, cut into pieces with my scissors directly into the onions and celery as they sauteed.  The bacon adds lots of salty flavor so I didn't use salt, but used lots and lots of fresh ground pepper.

I used ham instead of bacon, as I had leftover ham from Xmas dinner, and I added some bacon drippings that I had on hand.  This turned out fabulous!

Delicious!  I made it pretty much as written,  only I made a 1/2 batch for myself.  My husband doesn't care for potato soup,  but he decided to try it and LOVED IT! ... In fact I didn't get much of it... lol I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

I had to modify this recipe because two out of four of us can't do dairy.  I substituted olive oil for butter and almond mild for the cream.  It turned out really good.  I also had cooked up some ground buffalo with onions and I added that to the soup.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.

I thought the recipe was amazing but I did not follow it exactly. I did my own thing. I sauteed the onion, celery and garlic in virgin olive oil and 2tsp of butter. I used four large sweet potatoes instead. I used vegetable broth and added one teaspoon of chicken bouillon for flavor. I made my own heavy cream (1/3 cup of butter melted and I added 3/4cup of soymilk to it). I didn't have and tarragon so I looked up a substitute and found that I could use marjoram instead since I had that on hand. Lastly since I am a vegetarian I used vegetarian backon bits and stirred them into the soup instead of the actual bacon. Sounds like a lot but everything was done in the 40mins like the original recipe. My husband and 13 month old loved it. Oh and we topped our bowls with some shredded cheddar cheese. AMAZING!

This is wonderful! I did leave out the tarragon and cilantro. I added extra salt, Cheddar cheese, chicken (baked in the oven) and corn. I will definitely keep this in my Pinterest account to make again! It did take about 2- 2 1/2 hours to make but it's worth the time.

This recipe was great. I did however lack quite a few of the ingredients so I made quite a few substitutes that worked out great! In the second step I used skim milk with a dollop of sour cream and about 1/8 C of grated Romano cheese (for extra flavor boost). I also only had chicken broth so I added about 2 Tbs of chicken bullion to give it a richer flavor. Basil replaced the tarragon and of course plenty of salt and pepper added in slowly between the different steps. Even with all that it turned out great and my picky 8 year old ate it up! Will definitely save this recipe and make it again!

Doubled this recipe to feed my large family. Got race reviews!! Amazing flavor and texture. Creamy and hearty for cold Colorado nights. Didn't bother puree-ing part of the soup, just served it the way it was and loved every bite! Note - my husband doesn't are for cilantro, so I omitted that. Still superb.

I love this soup but it does take a lot of prep work , I would allow 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes. I made a couple of changes though. I used half and half instead of  heavy cream also I used 3 tablespoons of fresh cilantro. Because I prefer "soupy " soups I did not puree any of the soup.

This was very good. I did not have a pound of bacon so I added some diced ham along the few slices of bacon that I did have. I did not add the meat until after pureeing the vegetables.

My family absolutely loved it!!!  Made my own modifications.   Did not add tarragon & cilantro.  Chopped bacon then cooked till crisp.  Added bacon back at the end.  Used half & half instead of cream but will try milk next time as it was very thick.  Did not puree 1/2, just mashed the potatoes with my wisk.  Added sharp cheddar cheese at the end.  This recipe is so good, restaurant quality!!  The flavors of the bacon, cheese & green onion garnish gave it a loaded baked potato flavor.  My 11 yr old had a cooking lesson & prepared this with me.

Very good potato soup. Easy to make. I added light sour cream instead of heavy cream and used organic chicken broth powder instead of a can of chicken stock. I wasn't sure what tarragon was since I haven't use it be before so I used instead a dried bay leave. It came out very tasty when added shredded cheddar cheese on top.

Made this and it was AWESOME!  Used about half of everything.  Used red potates and used about 8.  Didn't have tarragon and used half and half for heavy cream.  FANTASTIC flavor!- Made again.  Had some left over rotel dip.  Added a bit into the soup and it was heaven.

This is a great recipe to make, especially when you don't have any meat in the house (I make it without the bacon a lot). It has a lot of flavor and is great to freeze as leftovers. I highly recommend this as a fast, fall meal. Great with biscuits and/or rolls.

I just finished making this soup and it is deliciously creamy and tasty! Perfect for today's weather, so glad I found it only. I followed every step except, I did not have tarragon so I sprinkled sage instead. I also love my garlic sea salt grinder so I used a bit for taste as I was worried it would have been bland! Can't wait for my honey to taste as he was curious when I was going to make the soup!!!

I make potato soup for winter church dinners, we omit the cilantro ( can't stand that stuff) and we use half and half rather than heavy cream, we also leave the celery out. Church members always comeback for more, we have to quadruple the recipe and  the pot is always empty. Instead of bacon we use diced ham. 

I'm only giving 3 stars though because of the changes I make. We like our comfort food to be smooth tasting.

This is FABULOUS!!! I make this all the time now...no chicken stock?? Use boullion...I've used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of making the cream sauce, sometimes cream of chicken soup & cream of celery..( I usually double the recipe for my Very Hungry Family)..used turkey bacon instead of pork..No matter how I change it up, it's always a big hit!! Love this recipe! Thanks So Much for putting it out there!!

Excellent recipe - because I am lazy and didn't want to have to do the puree step I used a potato soup starter (dried seasoning and potatoes) Added fresh parsley and green onions too, as I had them from our garden! Also added carrots, and used light cream. Delicious!

I thought the tarragon and cilantro gave this a strange flavor.  Maybe without these two things it would be fine?  I also substituted milk for cream and was still plenty creamy.

This was a big hit at my house! Even my picky 11 year old nephew loved it! It is a very thick soup, and added a couple more cloves of garlic. My only complaint is the misleading prep time, it does take more than 10 min for prep. But extremely worth it

Simply amazing! My while family loved it! I stuck to the original recipe for preparation and used yellow potatoes. I took another reviewers suggestion and added a cup of cheddar at the end and it turned out great! Just the little touch it needed. :)

My family loves this recipe!  I use only 6-7 slices of bacon and reserve it to add back in at the end so that it stays nice and crispy.  I also use 2% milk in place of the cream.  The soup still tastes rich and decadent; no one even misses the extra fat.  As I hate the mess in the blender I will take others' suggestion to just use a potato masher next time.  Thanks for the tip!

Best potato soup ever! I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and omitted the tarragon and cilantro (minor changes). I reserved a little of the bacon to use as a topping, along with shredded cheddar and chives. My new go-to recipe!

Good soup, but it was too heavy and greasy for my taste.  I would've used a half pound of bacon instead of a whole pound.  Otherwise it tasted fine.

My husband raved about it which is HUGE because he lost some of his ability to taste after a head injury. Most things taste bland to him. This soup has big flavor! I had turkey bacon on hand so I had to use the 1/4 C butter to saut√© the onions and celery. Served it up with grilled cheese with ham in them. Delish.

This recipe is great. Generally my son doesn't eat soups as there is a lot going on in it but this particular soup him and my husband almost at the entire amount right after I made it. This recipe is great and I didnt have to tweak it as it states season to your taste at the end of the recipe. I used turkey bacon as we don't eat pork. GREAT!

Thank you for sharing this recipe! It was absolutely delicious! I did lighten it up so it wouldn't be quite as fattening, and it was still very delicious! I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. It was a lot less fatty, but I had to add oil to the pot because there wasn't enough oil for sauteing the veggies because turkey bacon is so much less fatty. I also just used milk instead of using cream. It thickens up very nicely. Though I'm wondering just how wonderful it tastes when cream is used. I'll have to try that on a special occasion. :) I also ground up about 1 tsp of fennel seeds rather than using tarragon. I haven't used it before so I'm not really sure about the taste. I'll have to try it sometime! This recipe was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I made this soup as stated and was sure to use chicken stock and not broth.  I did add about one teaspoon of seasoned salt at the very end and it was FANTASTIC.  Thick and very filling. You can make it as thick or as thin as you like by blending more or less of the soup.  As good as it was, next time I'll probably add a bay leaf while the potatoes are cooking and use less bacon.  Time consuming?  Yes, but oh so worth it!

Loved this soup. Had to make some substitutions due to not having heavy cream (used half and half), tarragon, and allergy to cilantro (used Parsley and rosemary). Still supper yummy!

This is a good starting point for a potato soup recipe.  The soup as is does not fit my personal preferences, so there is definitely room for improvement.  I would make this again with some changes, such as the addition of cheese, celery salt, etc., adjust my family's tastes.

Perfect soup! I made it with garlic sausage instead of bacon = yum! I also added some fresh corn and carrots for color. This will make an impressive contribution to the next "bring a dish to pass" dinner that we go to!

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  My husband said it was "restaurant  good." Changes made : I hate cilantro so  I used parsley.  I also added  green chilis, roasted sweet corn and a little bit of cheese and crushed red pepper.  I made one batch with ham and one with bacon, and the bacon version was definitely our fave!  We like a little more spice in it.  Added a garden salad and it was a perfect dinner! Soup is very filling!

The soup is fine but the prep time is disingenuous at best. That's way more than 10 minutes prep time for an average cook.  Chopping bacon, onions, celery and garlic along with peeling and chopping potatoes all in 10 minutes?

A wonderful soup that is easy to make and great tasting.  Although I didn't have tarragon or cilantro,  I used  bit of parsley and it came out just fine.  I love the thickness of it as well.

Delicious! This was the first time I had attempted potato soup, and was so very pleased. This is better than I have had in many restaurants. I used 1/2 the bacon called for, and used green onions instead of white. Topped it off with a bit of cheese. Heavenly!

Very Good Soup.  However, this takes much more that 10 minutes of prep.  It is well worth it but just know what you are getting into.  I made exactly as stated and it needed nothing extra except some salt in my opinion.

Eh. This was just so-so. After reading all of the positive reviews (and as the title implies), I thought I was going to be in for a real treat. To my surprise, this was super BLAND! Even my hubs commented what a shame it was to indulge when there are better (and more satisfying) options out there to justify the splurge. :( NOTE: This makes a VERY large pot of soup! We enjoy leftovers during the hectic work week, so I made the full 8 servings worth. Unfortunately, we didn't care for this soup enough to make a second meal of it, so my parents were the happy recipients of our leftovers. :) Maybe this will become your go-to potato soup recipe, but it won't be mine. If you enjoy potato soup, Ellie's ham & potato soup seems to be the winner on here (and is a 5 star recipe in my book). Thanks anyways, Karena.

I made this recipe today.  It is a great recipe.  Keep one thing in mind when preparing this recipe....the one teaspoon of tarragon does come through in this recipe.  If you like this spice you are all set, but if you do not leave this spice out, or decrease the amount.  Next time I make this recipe I will probably add 1/4 teaspoon of tarragon.  Also, we prefer a soup that is not so thick...I ended up adding 3 tablespoons of flour to the butter and it thickened the liquid part of the recipe perfectly.  I used 24 ounces of chicken broth...that is all it took to cover my potatoes.  When preparing this recipe the aromas were wonderful.  I enjoy using Allrecipes when preparing meals.

Growing up I absolutely HATED potato soup.  But, whenever my boyfriend spends the weekend, we look for a new recipe to try out.  We sought out potato soups and came across this one.  We made it and love it, love it, love it!  Four thumbs up!!!  Definitely will make again.

YUMMY! My family are not big soup eaters (I am) so I thought I would enjoy this for days but the pot is all gone! They enjoyed it, even my picky 13 yr old. I didn't have heavy cream so I made it with 3/4 milk and 3 tbs melted, cooled butter. I also didn't have tarragon but I added a garlic and onion powder, white pepper and parsley flakes instead. I didn't have fresh cilantro, only dry so I used that too. This recipe is a sure fire keeper.

Good recipe. Found it rather bland. Added flat-leaved parsley instead of cilantro, and celery salt and bay leaves for added flavour. Seems like it needed another flavour base element, but great for children or fussy eaters.

I had to make a couple of omissions since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand (and I really wanted potato soup!). I did not add the cilantro or the tarragon and the taste was still a very good potato soup taste. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and glad I did as the texture was so thick, it was more like a big bowl of chunky mashed potatoes rather than a "soup", and I did not even puree any of the soup. I still very much enjoyed this soup and it was very filling. I may try next time to cook the potatoes less time (so they don't fall apart as easily creating a mashed consistency) and I probably will add more chicken broth and maybe a handful of shredded cheddar. Overall, I did like it and will make it again with these minor adjustments.

Very tasty potato soup! I only made two changes: 1.) I used thyme instead of tarragon. 2.) I only used 5 slices of bacon instead of 1 lb. Oh, and I added the thyme directly to the cooking potato, but I didn't add the cilantro until right before serving.

Wonderful recipe for a cold night, served with stone baked bread.  I will modify a few things next time though. 1. Cut back on bacon grease as others have stated & sub another kind of oil if needed to cook onion in(olive or canola) to cut back on fat content, also a little too much bacon favor taking away from potato flavor.  2. Had to add more stock/milk to make thinner b/c it was really thick as written. Made full recipe and froze 1/2 so hopefully freezing works. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this today substituting kielbasa for the bacon and it was AWESOME! When my MIL was alive, she used to make this incredible potato soup with kielbasa in it. I never asked her how she did it, I just inhaled it. She passed suddenly years ago and I've been searching for a replacement ever since.....and this is it!

This recipe is very much like the one I've always made and we just love it. The only thing I do differently is use celery seed instead of chopped celery so you still get that celery taste. You cannot beat a bowl of this soup and crusty french bread on a cold day...delicious!

This soup is absolutely amazing! I made this again (for the third time) for my wife and I, and I must say it gets better every time I make it.

I added lemon pepper and paprika, and used pre-minced garlic instead of fresh, left out the cilantro, and used "Better than Bullion" chicken stock base for the broth. I may have added too much garlic this time, but my wife and I love garlic, so it was all good!

This recipe is excellent, though I did make a few changes.  To cut down on some calories and saturated fat, I used a 12 oz can of fat free evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.   I also used 6 potatoes instead of 8 and 4 tbsp of butter instead of 3. I also used a12oz package of peppered bacon instead of a lb of regular bacon to add some more flavor.  It really turned out great, I will absolutely make it again with these same changes.  I love how there is no cheese but its still creamy and delicious! 5 stars for sure!

This soup was really good! Creamy and filling; perfect for a cold evening. I didn't have to puree anything, stirring did the trick. I added fresh chives and shredded cheese right before serving.

Very very good - even without the bacon!  I have made it both ways depending on what's in the fridge & I have to say, it's a keeper.  When I don't have cilantro, I sub thyme!

As written, this soup is lacking and is very heavy. I added at least a cup, likely more, of white wine with the chicken broth, several tablespoons of Chicken Flavored Better than Bouillon, garlic powder, lots of white pepper, salt & freshly cracked black pepper. I also added Asiago cheese to the roux. This recipe takes a good long time to make, much more than the poster says, once you brown the bacon, cut all the ingredients, etc. I'm letting the soup sit until the potatoes break down on their own. The flavor is good now, but definitely had to doctor it up!

Great soup! I used crushed rosemary instead of the other herbs.  Like many of the other reviews, I did not puree it but used a potato masher.  It tastes wonderful.  I haven't added any cream or cheese to it yet and think its great as is!

This soup is freaking amazing. I added a wee tiny bit extra cilantro as I just love that stuff, but I don't feel at all that it lacks flavor as some reviews have mentioned. I've had it with just milk instead of the whipping cream, and it was still delicious. Oh, i may have also added some paprika since I tend to add that into my potato salad and I love the flavors together, but I can't honestly recall right now.

I have made this soup in the past and it's great everytime.  
But this time I changed it up a bit I did not puree, nor did I add the tarragon (none on hand) and I added sour cream, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream (again did not have)  and some zesty seasoning along with some carrots. This is a great soup that you can make your own.. 5 Stars...  thanks for sharing..
Great soup..

The only modification I made to this recipe was a dash of salt in the food processor (well, more like a few teaspoons), and some parmesan cheese to the top.  Also, the recipe needs to specify the size of potato. Are we talking 8 LARGE russet potatoes? I bought 8, and quickly realized I need use only 4. Unlike many recipes out there, this one didn't turn into mushy soup. I didn't have to add a ton of flour to get the right consistency. I'm very pleased! I will be using this again. And again. And perhaps again!

Excellent soup.  Very hearty meal for a cold winter day.  I didn't add the bacon to the soup until the very end and I didn't use any herbs other then a little salt and pepper.  I mashed the potatoes right in the pot, but would have preferred the soup to be a little bit more liquidy.  Everyone in the family loved it.  Thanks for an awesome soup that I will definitely make again.

This was soooo good! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream because I had some on hand. I also added chopped carrots and ham because I needed to use them up. I added a little sour cream before eating because I have done that before with other soups and really liked it. I will be making this all winter for my family!

Excellent recipe! Since I'm vegetarian, I changed the recipe to omit bacon altogether, but it turned out to be pretty good without bacon. I added a little bit of Sriracha to the soup for a bit of kick, and it was delicious!

Made this for dinner tonight - really good! I used half & half instead of heavy cream and didn't use bacon at all, just to cut down on the fat a little. My family loved it!

I have to say its the first time I have made this type of soup and i followed everything in the recipe.  I added a little more salt and a tbsp of Chicken Bouillon. Decorated with some bacon, green onions and Cheddar, everyone loved it.

This recipe definitely was absolutely delicious!  My husband & I had it last night with nice crusty bread.  Other reviewers were right about the flour, it wasn't necessary for us. I used my immersion blender right in the pot after the soup was done, and I did use half & half instead of heavy cream.  Oh my did we love it. We have lots left and will thin it out with a little more chicken stock as we eat the yummy leftovers.

Full of flavor and absolutely wonderful! My whole family loved it. I added more garlic and less celery, one stalk instead. Put some sharp cheddar cheese and scallions on top and called it good. Couldn't think of any other changes I'd make.

Very good, however, I have to disagree with ever adding a flour base to a starchy soup.  To thicken this soup just puree a portion of your potatoes and add back into the soup.  You can always add an extra potato or two for this step. You can still add your cream and butter for richness if you want.

This is the soup my mother made so many times during WW2, but without the bacon.  I don't know if she made it with cream or milk.  She learned from her mother during the depression.  It is so good to taste the chunks rather than all mushed. Didn't use tarragon or cilantro - just don't forget the parsley.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't change a thing!  I also love how you put right in the description that this is a treat and not for calorie counters!!!  So tired of reading reviews that come off as the diet police.  We can all read the nutritional information ourselves.

YES!!!!!Just do it! After making this several times I have tried smoked polish sausage in place of the bacon. Just use butter in place of the bacon grease.

I didn't use the bacon. I substituted liquid Coffee Mate for the cream and saved calories that way, too. Also, I used 3 bay leaves, 1 teas. Worcestershire and half a lime for some zing.  Excellent.

Perfect for a Fall day! 

I made some slight modifications.  I omitted the tarragon and cilantro and used Oscar Mayer Real Bacon and used 2% milk vs. the heavy cream, and it came out delicious!  Next time I think I will add some carrots.

this was really good!  It is a bit rich with the cream and thickener.  I made it with my homemade chicken stock and it tasted really good at that point (i.e. without the cream, flour and added in) Next time I might just make this and stop at the chicken stock point and then add in the targoon and cilantro

I just made this soup tonight for my family it is wonderful and very comforting on a cold lazy day like today.  I did everything as noted except I added a can of cream of chicken soup since I did not have chicken stock, still used the chicken broth though along with it.  I mixed about a 1/3 of the soup in the blender and then added it back to the pot, I like a chunk or two of potato in my soup, not just a puree.  Very good, and will make again.

This recipe deserves its title.  After trying it the first time, I have made it a total of 3 times in one week.  The only change that I made was in adding 1 cup of milk to the cream mixture, otherwise it would have been too thick for my taste.  The flavor is awesome!

Good for the most part but needs a lot of extra seasoning.  I added cumin and paprika also a lot more garlic (8 cloves). I also added some chopped fennel and replaced the onion with leeks. I didn't use the flour and came out nice and thick. Sometimes I'll add a handful or two of frozen corn.  Nice texture and taste addition.

Really good soup. You can control how creamy it gets, by how much you puree it. I found it was a bit bland until I topped it with grated cheddar. My family loved this recipe, and my hubby told his mom all about it!

I served this at a dinner party and it was one of the best soups I have made!  I used red onion partly for colour and partly for taste. I also omitted the tarragon but kept the cilantro, which does add that little bit of oomph at the end. I  served it with a small bit of shredded cheddar cheese and a bit of chopped green onion on top - looked amazing and had rave reviews at my dinner party. Thanks for a great keeper!

I made a few changes to suit our preferences, but this was excellent! I used half and half instead of cream and only half a pound of bacon and that was plenty. I left out the celery, tarragon and cilantro and topped with sour cream and cheese. Yumm!!

I have made potato soup before but nothing is like this one.  It is worth all the prep.  So rich and great with fresh bread.  Almost better than pecan pie.  LOL...

This soup was so heavenly.  I left out the herbs and thought the flavor was still really good.  I served with cheddar cheese.  This is the best potato soup! Yum!

I have made this soup many times though I don't make it often because it is very high calorie.  I make it exactly as the recipe is written usually with Yukon Gold potatoes.  I have tried substituting milk or half and half for the cream and it doesn't not taste nearly as good so I just make it less frequently as a treat.  This is the only potato soup I ever make and everyone loves it.  Thanks

After reading many of the reviews, I had high hopes for this recipes.  I was disappointed in it after I made it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it just didn't have much flavor at all.  I ended up adding some garlic powder to it, which helped.  I really couldn't taste the bacon in it and will wait until serving it before adding it next time.

I omitted the bacon because I was making it for vegetarians and used 1/4 cup of butter as previously suggested. I also used leeks instead of onions and the flavor was amazing!!  Incredible flavor!!

Very tasty and creamy with nice chunky texture.  I definitely think it was a plus to process half of the soup to give it that extra creaminess.  The Bacon adds some needed flavor, but otherwise it is just a BIT bland.  Great otherwise though.

I would have to agree that it is missing something.  Tasted good, but not something I was overly impressed with.  I will probably look for another recipe the next time I make potato soup.

This was the best potato soup I ever made. I was full of flavor and the perfect consistency. I used a half a pound of turkey bacon and I also added cheddar cheese at the end. I think next time I might use fat free half and half or 2% milk to lower the fat content but I will definitely be making this soup often!

Tastey! I however used evaporated milk because I didnt have heavy cream.  I used the whole 14oz can because people said it was very thick, but it still turned out very thick which is what I wanted anyways.  Didn't use cilantro.  Used only 1/2 lb of bacon and cooked for a total of 3 hrs on low :) Used a potato masher to act as if blending, was easier. I will be using this recipe over and over again.  Thanks!

This recipe turned out quite bland for me. I added some cayenne pepper and some cheese, and that helped, but this recipe is not one I will make again.  Also, you may want to add more chicken stock when you are cooking it as mine turned out quite thick.  One thought to anyone who might be looking for a baked potato soup--this isn't it (and never claims to be), but I thought I would point out that the flavors are quite distinct.

This was absolutely delicious.  My husband made one comment which was, "It needs more meat!"  Which was funny because I didn't have a whole pound of bacon and used what I had on hand which was only a fourth.  This has definitely earned a permanent place in my recipe box!

I actually signed up for a membership just so I could rate this recipe!  I followed it exactly, and it was DELICIOUS.  It was a fairly quick weeknight meal, and use too many ingredients that I had to go out and buy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was wonderful! I have not had much luck with potato soups, but this one turned out just the way I like it. I made some substitutions, to reduce the fat content. I used turkey bacon and hallf & half instead of heavy cream. This was time consuming to prepare but well worth it. The prep time is listed as 10 minutes and the cook time is listed as 30. No way, I would say I spent closer to two hours. Next time I'll probably double up on the garlic and herbs, just for my own personal taste prefrences.

I thought this soup was very good. I prepared exactly as written as I don't believe in rating a recipe after you've made changes. I did add some sharp white cheddar cheese though which just added to an already very tasty soup.

Amazing,creamy,rich with a touch of smokey flavor from the bacon.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of cream, and added celery seed and chives instead of cilantro and tarragon only because I don't have them.  If you don't puree 1/2 the soup, you're missing the extra creaminess this provides.  Great comfort soup!  Thank you for the recipe.

I fixed this for my family and everyone liked it.  The only problem for us was the bacon.  Next time I will save the bacon for putting on top of the soup along with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Consistency was a little thick--I added milk to thin. overall great flavor.

This recipe was really good, however I did make some minor changes that I felt were more healthy. I used turkey bacon as well as half and half instead of whole cream, and some colby jack cheese. I think that next time I will totally omit the bacon from the recipe because after cooking the bacon and then putting it back into the soup it became soggy again, and I am not a big fan of the texture of soggy bacon. Next time I will add some broccoli, it was a good recipe and it will be made again. I served this with the chedder bay biscuits and everyone had seconds.

This a good recipe.  I only gave it 3 stars because I thought that it was way to much chicken broth.  I will probably try this again but I will cut the broth down a lot.  I did add cheddar cheese like some others suggested and that was good.  Other then that I like that it was a thick soup.

This soup is fantastic! To make it a little more cholesterol friendly I used turkey bacon instead and added a couple of TBS of olive oil for the sauteeing of the veggies. Even the kids loved it!

Excellent recipe. I substituted fat free half and half and used turkey bacon to cut down on fat. Thanks for the good soup!

Turned out really great!  I used parsely instead of tarragon. I used organic, red potatoes, and left the skin on the tater. All of the nutrients are in the skin. I also added a bit of cheddar cheese. Thank you so much for a soup recipe that works!!!!

This was an amazing recipe.  I could not get enough of it.  I modified the recipe a bit.  I decided not to use the 1 lb of bacon and used butter instead of bacon grease.  I did eventually add bacon, some of that pre-cooked stuff.  That was actually a good move.  I added some vegetable oil after I put in the potatoes and that seemed to work well.  I did not have enough butter for the flour and cream mixture so I used margarine in place of it.  It ended up fine.  This recipe is open to so many spices so just have fun with it and go with your instincts.  Cheese goes well with it as well.  :)

This is the best Potato Soup I have ever made!!!  My husband loves it!  It is perfect for a cold day or a long day hunting as it will fill you up!  Try a little cheddar cheese on top with a big slice of bread and butter.  Nothing is better!

I highly recommend this recipe. I made potato soup for the first time using this recipe. My husband has been talking about it for days. It was very creamy and had a wonderful flavor. It does have a lot of fat and calories because of the bacon and the cream, so I will probably only make it for special occasions.

I made this tonight and it was great. My husband complimented me several times. I used canned chicken broth with some boullion cubes to make it more flavorful.  I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the cream sauce til it blended well.  I added more cream to it a little at a time.  It was so fulling.  Perfect fall meal.  I would have to say that the time is inaccurate though. From start to finish incl cooking the bacon it was about 90 mins

I don't usually rate anything as "perfect", but in this case I must. I've made this soup many, many times and it always comes out awesome.  The only things I do differently is I use fresh parsley instead of the cilantro, and leave out the tarragon.

I would consider this soup a masterpiece of flavor, this was my very first soup attempt and out of 8 people(one who really wasn't a soup or potato person), everyone said it was absolutely delicious and I would have to agree so with them. The flavors mix together perfectly and you get a little bit of everything in each bite. Overall, I couldn't have chosen a better soup then this!!!

It has a little too much bacon fat taste to it. Other than making sure the bacon is in really small pieces when it is put back into the soup and using even less than 1/4 c of bacon fat, this recipe was good.

This is a bit time consuming but very tasty.  I made the recipe exactly except I didn't have any heavy cream and used fat free half-and-half instead.  It still thickened up nicely and didn't affect the taste at all.  I used a hand held immersion blender and 3 quick pulses and the soup was almost pure√©d more than I wanted.  Be careful to not over process - soup was not as chunky as I intended it to be.

I think I read a review that started with, "Oh my arteries!"  I think that about sums up this recipe!  But, it was very good and the hubby liked it a lot.  I'm still looking for something like Black Angus's Potato Soup.  I love that.  But you won't be dissapointed with this soup! Yummy on a cold day! 
( I left out the tarragon and it was still great!)

Loved this recipe! I had omitted the tarragon and cilantro but it was alittle bland without. Will use next time. Also, I didn't use the bacon, due to lent, and increased the butter but then it was quite buttery. Oh well, still quite good the next day! Will use over and over!

OK, am I the only one that felt like I was eating a bowl of gravy?  WAY TOO GLUTENOUS for us.  Although it was tasty, it was too thick, even though I "watered" it down with twice the amount of half and half (recipe calls for heavy cream, though)  I used only five pieces of bacon and that was plenty.  I gave it three stars because I would probably make this again, but with a revision.  Leave out or reduce the flour, so it does not have such a pasty consistancy. The recipe says to puree half of the soup, next time I wouldn't take as much out...we like it a little more chunky.  Good luck on this one...Hope you're not on a diet.

This is Absolutely a great potato soup!!!  I was looking for a simple potato soup and came across this recipe that everyone seemed to love.  After making it, I can honestly say that it is much more than a 'simple' soup...it truly is very good and tastes like something you would get in a nice restaurant.  Thank you Karena, this is a keeper!!!!

Took a lot longer to cook than recipe indicated.

Ended up with a sink full of dirty dishes.

Husband who is not a soup fan LOVED this soup.

I thought it had to much bacon. He did not.

I left out the tarragon & cilantro because I did not have it on hand.

Will I make again...Only if my husband offers to do the dishes again!!

This is soooo good.  Easy.  I've fixed it twice for our football coaches.  They love it - a recipe for 12 and the 6 guys clean it up.  Had to print off another copy of this for one of them.  Just love it - to heck with the calories.

Very good soup.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes per other reviews and they were great.  I wouldn't make this too often due to the fat content.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was very good - it does take a while, but its so worth it on a cold day - the texture was interesting, my boyfriend dubbed it Orphanage Gruel because it was almost mashed potatos with chunks, excellent but thick - used less potatos next time and it had more of a broth base - personally all the bacon and grease is a little overwhelming i think i could cut the amount of bacon in half and it would be fine

This soup is really good.  I adjusted the recipe for a party of 20 and I still only needed a quarter cup of bacon fat to saute all of the onion, celery, and potatoes.  If I ever make this for a smaller group, I will not use the amount of bacon fat that the recipe calls for.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I didn't have the tarragon or cilantro however so I just added salt, pepper and dill and it was wonderful!  I can't wait to try it with the listed spices after I get to the grocery store.

When your at the camper and you have 6 plus kids that all come trailing behind your own 2, this recipe hits the spot.  The kids ate it all but I did manage to get a spoonfull or 2.  So when you have a cool day fix this for the tribe at your house.

I added tyme at the end instead of cilantro because I thought cilantro was a wierd pair with a potato soup. I added to much but that was my own fault, however, it was very good not the best I made but the family really liked it..

Excellent recipe, I used Skim evaporated milk instead of cream and put in pieces of bratwurst instead of the bacon.  I also omitted the celery because I don't like celery.  Rave reviews from the whole family.

This is more like a chowder than a soup, and it is delicious! I was little apprehensive about the cilantro but I followed the recipe exactly and it is great - I even added more cilantro. It is time consuming with all the chopping but the actual cooking time is quick. I would say prep is 20 minutes and cook time is 20 minutes. It is raining today and this soup really hits the spot!

Very good!! I did cut back on the bacon to about half, used green onions (personal preference), half and half in place of cream and fresh dill in place of the tarragon and cilantro. Will make again with maybe the addition of sharp cheddar, thanks for the recipe!

I left the cilantro and tarragon (b/c I didn't have them) and threw in a couple bay leaves and some oregano. Amazing recipe... We had left overs, because it was so filling, so my husband had it for dinner every night that week! I will deffinately make this again!

Although this has many rave reviews, we thought this was pretty dull tasting, and the bacon was overpowering.  Leftovers have been sitting in my freezer waiting to be eaten...

I added cauliflower and CHEESE because we love cheesy soups.  Doubled the recipe for my ten kids ages 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7,9,9 and everyone LOVED it!!  "Can we eat this everynight?"  "This is great mom!"  "I like this better than our OLD potato soup."  Took some to a friend who says she won't share with her kids and I hope I have some left for my husband when he gets home. ;)This is a keeper!!

This is really a good potato soup recipe.  My husband loved it and even asked if I could make some that he can bring with him for lunch at work!

I didn't have tarragon, but it still came out really good.  I am going to get some tarragon and see if it'll be even better next time I make it.

This soup was out of this world. I shared it with everyone at work. The only thing I would change would be the heavy cream to milk to make it less fattening. But other than that it was a very tasty soup.

This soup is absolutely delicious. It is so hearty and has such a wonderful flavor.  I did however do a few things different.  When I cut my bacon up, I threw away the ends that had all of the fat.  So when I fried up the bacon, there wasn't that much grease.  So I drizzled a little olive oil on the celery and onions and it was fine.  I also left out the tarragon and cilantro beacause I didn't have any and it still tasted great.  I don't think that I will add it next time either.  I think it will cover up that great bacon flavor.  Thank you Karena for a great recipe!!!

Yum! This was great soup, made it while I was on a conference call, so its easy too.  I used half and half and just a little more flour and dried cilantro because I didn't have fresh.

This is one of the best potato soup recipes I have found!  I added a bit of carrot and some homemade rivels (small dumplings made of egg, flour, and salt) and watched my family almost lick their bowls clean!  Great on an icy winter night like we've had lately.  MMMMMMM!!

Really good.  Added carrots and used leeks instead of onion.  We didn't puree half, just mashed a bit with spoon. Easy to make and great taste, flavorful and creamy.

Yummy - great flavor!  This recipe is not difficult but has a few steps.  I used a few different ingredients to make it a little healthier.  First, I used turkey bacon (I prefer the Louis Rich brand) which has less than half the fat of "real" bacon but still adds great flavor.  I also used 1 cup of 2% milk rather than cream but mixed about 4 tablespoons of cream with 1 tablespoon of flour to replace the thickness that a cup of cream would have added.  I did not use cilantro but added 2 dried bay leaves when I added the stock and simmered everything for about 20 minutes before I pureed (make sure not to puree the bay leaves if you use them).  I simmered the soup for another 10-15 minutes.  This recipe makes 8 generous size servings.  Make it a meal by serving in a bread bowl!  Great to freeze & reheat.

This was an OK potato soup - not the best I've ever had.  It was weird that it wasn't creamy colored, like another reviewer said.  Maybe it's the kind of potato I used.  I will try it again because I think my hubby 'co-creating' with me might have influenced the outcome:)

Okay...so I thought I ALREADY had a great potato soup recipe, but when I couldn't find it yesterday, I came here to find another.  This is by far the BEST potato soup I've ever had and is definitely a keeper.  It is very flavorful, creamy, and hearty.  You can't go wrong with this one.

My hubby and I agree - this is absolutely the best potato soup we've ever eaten.   Out goes the recipe I've used for years.   I followed the recipe except for using instant mashed potato flakes to thicken instead of the flour.   So much easier, and doesn't detract from the flavors at all.   Just sprinkle in a little at a time until you reach the thickness you want.   Can't wait to try this on my son when he comes home from college on Christmas break.    ummmmm good.

A cold front came through last night and woke up with a hankerin' for soup.  I looked in the fridge and found some potatoes then did my AllRecipes search.  This recipe is a bit time consuming but WELL WORTH IT!!  It is the BEST potatoe soup I have ever tasted!!  Enjoy!

I have made this four times so far, and it is a HUGE hit.  The only thing is that I don't like celery, so I substituted carrots instead.  The paste idea is so good... and it was worth buying the good spices for this one.  I am putting this is the keep file!

This recipe is awsome.  I have my own small business and cook and bake meals for people.  This is the favorite of many.  I made this about 2 weeks ago for a church lunch, and of about 15 different soups, it was the first one to go.  very good soup, lots of work but well worth the effort.

This smelled soooo good while it was cooking, but I was definatly dissapointed when it was finished.  Left overs were better, next time, I think I'll double the spices, cuz the smell was really good.

Yum!!!  I added diced carrots to the mix and decided to not use the tarragon or cilantro.  Very good, my husband loves it and is happy to have leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best potato soup I've ever had. My family LOVED it when I fixed it last night. Definitely a keeper. Even shared some at work today and everyone has asked for the recipe. We're not big celery fans, so I reduced to one stalk of celery and I didn't have any tarragon, so I left it out. Will probably add next time, but was delicious if you don't have any! Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy! I typically make a different Potato Soup recipe that is kind of a tradition in our family, but decided to try something new.  This was easier and had a fresher taste!  I served it with Sun Dried Tomato Asiago Bread. My husband said he would eat more, but it simply wouldn't fit in his stomach. Thanks for sharing!

This must be the ultimate of a 5 star recipe! I feel I should maybe not review it becasue I had to make some changes to accomodate what was in my pantry, but it came out great, and it's not too hard, potatoes take a while to cook, so it does take time, but easy. i made half a batch, used garlic powder, chicken broth, and no bacon and added a whole bunch of chives form my garden. It's great with a little bit of cheese to top it all off. I will be making again soon with bacon...it really is unreal!!

I lightened this recipe by using lean smoked sausage sliced thinly instead of bacon and fat free half and half instead of cream.  I also used half the butter and thickened the dish with cornstarch at the end.  I imagine the original is awesome, but I don't dare try it while I am trying to lose weight!

This is definetly the absolute best potato soup ever.  My husband practically died when he tried it.  He couldn't believe i didn't buy it.  He says it is even better than the toscana soup at olive garden.  It is there version of potato soup.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!!!!!!

This is comfort food at its best and thank you for the recipe Karena! As usual, I tweaked this recipe a bit but not by much. The only changes I made was that I thickend it with about 1/2 cup instant mashed potatoes flakes, as opposed to the cream to save some calories, thereby leaving the potatoes in tact, as we prefer. I also added some shredded cabbage at the end, or almost any other vegetable would be fine. The basic flavor of this economical and savory soup is superb and I'm thrilled that I never have to search for another potato soup recipe again. This one has a permanent spot in my files & hubby raved about it too! Try a little Polish flair to it like I grew up with by adding the cabbage along with some savory brown mustard lightly drizzled over your serving. Yummy...this is the stuff that makes a tummy happy.

This soup was pretty good.  I did not want to add meat, so I cooked a ham bone and added the broth to compensate for the bacon.  I did not have taragon, so I added thyme instead.  I also added an extra potato since I love to have plenty of potato chunks.  This is the best recipe I have used so far--even with all of the substitutions.  Very high in calories, but well worth it.

This was good, not ultimate but with a few modifications this was delicious. I like using Cream of Mushroon soup with milk instead of heavy cream.  I felt like being daring so I added nutmeg and cayenne to this to give it a little twist.   No Tarragon, didn't have any.

Yum!  The first time I made this it was for a group of 16 pheasant hunters.  I made a pot of chili too.  There was plenty of chili left over, but not one drop of this soup!  We will have it often!

The name definitely fits this soup... I like many others did not puree a portion at the end, as it becomes WAY too thick.  Very, very, VERY yummy!

I did not like this with the tarragon and cilantro, so I added my own seasonings to save the meal.  It had a greenish tint to it that was not appealing to the eye, my eye anyway.  I will just stick with my recipe.

Since I'm currently on a diet, I altered this recipe somewhat and it still turned out great.

I used 5 pieces of turkey bacon instead of 1 lb. of regular bacon, then sauteed the veggies in 1 tbsp. of light margarine.  I also used light margarine in the flour mixture and skim milk instead of heavy cream.

The soup had awesome flavor even with the subsitutions!

Oh my God, this soup was sooooo good!  I left out the flour, butter, terragon, and cilantro and added more garlic because I love garlic.  It took longer to prepare, but it was well worth it!!!  I will make this again very soon!  Thanks!

We never had potato soup, so we weren't sure what to expect.  It was average I guess.  We like our soup with some substance (not just veggies).  Served these with french bread and they were alright.  Not making this again though.

I thought it was pretty good, but for some reason the flour used for the sauce gave it kind of a weird taste.  but it was pretty good.

I too agree this is the best potato soup. Better than my Mom's. Sorry Mom. I love the thickness of it - You can eat it with a fork. Next time I'll add more tarragon and garlic. I can't wait to share this recipe with friends.

I made this soup for a potluck we went to and thought I'd have some left for my lunch the next day....boy was I wrong. It was a hit and everyone raved about how great the soup was. 

One of my husbands friends even told me if I ever get tired of him he would take me if I can cook that good. :-)

This will become a family favorite for the winter months. Thanks for allrecipes.com I was the cool wife that night.

My husband is always raving about his grandma's potato soup, and she will not give out the recipe, so I tried making this one, it was easy and very good, though he said it doesn't rival hers, he has asked for it again since. And I found it to be very flavorful.
Thanks for sharing!

This soup was SO GOOD!  I only added half the cilantro and didn't add the tarragon. Also, we used turkey jerky so I added some butter to make up for the loss of bacon grease. I also added green beans and carrots. My husband and I really enjoyed it and can't wait for the winter months to come.  Also, it makes A LOT, great for leftovers or freezing.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us

This was a very nice soup.  I decreased the celery as I am not very fond of it.  I also added some carrots to the soup.  My family enjoyed it. I will make again.

Great soup! I did use ham instead of bacon (we just have to have ham in our potato soup) but did throw in half a jar of real bacon bits for flavor. I only pureed a quarter instead of half, was just the right consistency. The wife loved it and said I had to give it 5 stars.

This is the best potato soup I have ever put into my mouth.  The only enhancement I made was to use 6 inch sourdough rolls as bread bowls.  There is just something awesome about eating the bowl, besides the flavor of course.

Awesome!  I only put 3/4 tsp tarragon & next time I think I'll only put 1/2 tsp.  It was a little strong for me. Also, I didn't put any cilantro at all.  This was by far the best potato soup recipe I've found.  Hubby said I had to put this recipe in a safe place! Prep time was somewhat long with all the peeling, chopping, etc, but worth it...

The name of this recipe is very appropriate.  It is the Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup.  My husband and I love it.  I usually double the recipe and give some to my parents and in-laws.  Everyone loves it!  It takes a little time to prepare but is so worth it.  Thank you for sharing Karena. :)

Very good!  The garlic and tarragon took potato soup to a whole other dimension!  (I did not have clilantro on hand).  I omitted the bacon and substituted cubed ham.  I also used whole milk in place of the cream.  The soup was fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't personally like this--the bacon was too mushy, but I made it for a group of twenty who raved over it and went back for seconds and thirds.

The taste of this soup was gppd, but it required a substantial amount of prep time.  I added carrots and used half & half instead of cream, and also cooked it in the slow cooker.  I'm not a cilantro fan, and omitted the herb.  I found that I had to jazz it up with bacon bits on top in order to add a little burst of flavor.  I also topped with shredded cheese and chives.  Will I make it again?  Definitely, if I have a lot of time on my hands on a blistery winter day.

This recipe is really great.  I used half and half instead of whole cream and it came out great.  Even my kids (who do not like soup) liked this.

I have five children and I couldn't believe how fast this soup disappeared.  Everyone of my children had more than one helping.  They have asked that we have this soup once a week.  It really is "THE BEST SOUP EVER".

I FINALLY found the perfect potato soup recipe, and to think there is NO cheese in it!  You'll need to make a double batch if you want any leftovers.

WOW!!! This is very very delicious. I've made it 5 times in the last 2 months and had tons of recipe requests!!! I cooked the veggies with butter flavor spray and used packaged real bacon bits (much lower fat than cooking your own) and topped with shredded cheddar and chopped green onions. I can't get enough of this stuff!!

It was good. I ended up spending more than the 40 minutes preparing, but it was a pretty good result.  I would cut down on the garlic though.

This was excellent. However, I thought the tarrigon was a bit overpowering. I would cut back on the tarrigon and let all those other beautiful flavors come out.
I servrd this w/ Texas Garlic toast and my guests loved it!

This recipe was wonderful.  After I cooked the bacon ( I used turkey bacon) I put it in the food processor to make it much smaller and more appealing in the soup.  I also used red potatoes.  Otherwise I would not change a thing.  It was perfect!

This soup is AWESOME! I made it to go with my meatloaf one night for a dinner party with friends. It got RAVE reviews. I disagree with cutting out the fat though. As a matter of fact, add a dollup of sour cream and cheddar cheese to the serving bowls and garnish with parsley. Looks and tastes wonderful.

I made this soup recently for my family and got rave reviews. My three year old son, who doesn't eat anything but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches loved it and asked for seconds. I've give this recipe to several family members who tried it and loved it. Thank you I now have a new family favorite.

We left out the cilantro and the soup was too thick (so next time I would not add nearly as much flour to the roux); but the whole family loved this hearty meal.

I concur with others' suggestions -- this soup doesn't have to be nearly as fattening as the recipe suggests, in order to taste great.  Cut the bacon in half, use fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream.  Make this if you're REALLY in the mood for some serious cooking, b/c your kitchen will be a mess when you're done an hour or so later!  Very good, but too much of a hassle to make except on rare occasions. Top with chives and cheddar cheese.

This is the best tasting potato soup I have tasted so far.  I only had 6 medium potatoes on hand at the time.  I thinned down the flour mixture with an extra 1/2 cup of cream.  It turned out with just the right thickness for me.  Wish I had weighed the potatoes to be more precise about the amount.

This was definatley a very tasty soup, although, it was very rich tasting and I felt guilty eating it.  The next time I make it, I think that I will try to reduce the fat content by a bit by using milk instead of cream,  less bacon fat  and less margerine.

Very good soup! My family likes a more whitish soup when it comes to cream soup, so I replaced two cups of chicken broth for two cups half & half. Much creamier and more appealing color. But this is truly an outstanding recipe!

This soup was very tasty.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, and they were a bit too mealy.  My soup turned out more like very soft mashed potatoes.  Next time, I think I'll try a different type of potato, and I might add milk to thin it out a bit.  However, I love the flavor in this soup!  Give this recipe a try if you like baked potato soup!

I recall when i was younger my father making almost this exact recipe! It is wonderful. My only problem was the bacon. (I ain't going to the gym for nothing!) So, I opted for half the bacon. It was so hearty!

Just the BEST potato soup. I balked at thickening the cream with flour but did it anyway with perfect results. Didn't have any tarragon and since I live in Germany cilantro wasn't available, made the soup anyway and it still tasted great. Thank You!

this is by far the best potato soup Ive made. Everyone loved it, especially my 3 year old! I didnt use the bacon, and I  used half and half in place of the cream, and the turnout was excellent!! A keeper in this house. Thanks for the great recipe.

I found this recipe easy to make but was a little dissapointed with the overall taste. I doubled the amount of herbs and seasonings so that the flavor would come through. Submitter also forgot to include in her recipe that you will need at least 4 cups of chicken stock.  Thank goodness I had it on hand half way through the recipe!
