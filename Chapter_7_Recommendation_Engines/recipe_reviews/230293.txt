I'm always on the look out for new slow cooker recipes and Mr. LTH loves all things potato, so I knew this was right up our alley.  I did all of the prep the night before (sliced potatoes and then kept them in cold water in the frig and sauteed the mushrooms) and tossed everything in the crock pot the next morning.  I did reduce the cheese by about a cup and had to sub light cream for milk when I realized ours smelled a bit off.  It was a nice side, but I'm not sure I'll make it again, simply because Mr. LTH didn't love it ("it's ok") and it's too high calorie, low nutrient to become a staple here.  THANKS, Kat!

I used an Artisan mushroom soup, really liked it.  You could also put porkchops  on top while cooking, delicious.

Made as noted but used only 3 cups of cheese. I felt this was plenty. Smell was amazing while cooking. These were very good.

I found it very greasy with all the cheese and butter.  Will not make it again.

Left out mushrooms, my family doesn't like them. Sliced potatoes in processor thin. Still some were not cooked. Kind of on the bland side.

This was just okay.  Took forever to get the potatoes done.  Other recipes similar to this that are much better.

This is some awesome comfort food.  I've made it as a dinner side dish, enjoyed leftovers for breakfast--simple to make but so good.
