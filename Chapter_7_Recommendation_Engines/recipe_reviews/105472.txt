I loved it! The first time it was terrible, becuase the corn starch gummed up. The second time I put the cornstarch in some of the milk first and it was perfect. My dad who has never liked anything I have made with splenda, I told him it was real sugar and he believed me (so did everyone else). They LOVED it!

A great recipe that you will want to repeat.  Especially good for those who do not prefer a really sweet dessert.  We have made it three or four times and it is easy to prepare and always comes out perfect.

I would use the sugar-free instant chocolate pudding mix with skim milk following package pudding directions and fat free cool whip topping. It's better and faster for those who leads busy lives.

My DH loves this pie!!! First time made by recipe and found chocolate filing was too paste tasting so now I back off on the cornstrach. To cut back on calories/fat and save money I prepared my own graham cracker crust. This can be done with butter flavored cooking spray and ten or more low or non-fat plain graham crackers crushed in a processor or by a rolling pin in a zip bag. Spray the pie pan and press grahams on bottom and sides. For variations: use low or non-fat chocolate grahams or add a little touch of Splenda brown sugar & cinnamon to the plain graham. I also use a no sugar frozen whipped topping and sometimes use lower fat milk or non-fat powdered milk prepared to equal the 2 1/2 cups milk.
