I love this recipe!!  I love almond-anything, and the combination of dairy/fruit/nut in this parfait was so yummy.  I used home-canned peaches instead of plums (since I had them on hand), so I skipped the directions related to the plums.  I also added some almond extract to the ricotta/maple syrup mixture.  And I carmelized the almonds in sugar so they were sweet and crunchy.  This makes an excellent healthy dessert, or even something to serve as a side.

This recipe as written was not particularly good. The plums sauteed in maple syrup and butter was very good, but the ricotta cheese mixed with maple syrup was gritty and not enjoyable to eat. I removed the ricotta and used cream instead (without the syrup). I also shaved some dark chocolate over the top. The revised dish was a hit.

I made this with fresh strawberries instead and it was fantastic.
