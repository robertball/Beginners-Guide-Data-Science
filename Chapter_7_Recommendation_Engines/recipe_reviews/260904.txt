I thoroughly enjoyed this latte. I was a bit confused with the ingredients, tbs Sugar-free caramel topping and tbs caramel sauce. I've always thought they were the same thing. So I used 2 tbs Smuckers Caramel Sundae Syrup which I added along with the vanilla, brown sugar and milk, heated and frothed with an immersion blender. I poured it in a cup then placed in my Ninja Coffee Bar and wound up with a delicious layered latte.

This is a nice treat if you want a hot coffee latte. I donâ€™t know the difference between caramel topping and caramel sauce, so I just used some homemade caramel sauce for both. Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic.  Left off the caramel sauce.  Just like I get in the stores, even better.

This is a very good latte; however, I made it a little differently. I added the vanilla in with the milk and brown sugar. The 1% milk I used frothed up very nicely, and I had quite a bit of foam. I added the caramel topping to the coffee and left out the extra tablespoon called for. Then I poured the foam on top of the coffee. It was wonderfully flavored and not too sweet.

Easy to make and delicious. However, the recipe doesn't tell you what to do with the extra tablespoon of caramel sauce/topping. I just added it to the coffee mix.
