Whenever my family want something warm and comforting, I make this dish.  I use chicken thighs, personal preference, I chop onions and garlic and fry those up then use the oil and drippings from the onions/garlic to brown the chicken before placing it in the baking dish with the rice mixture...I use garlic/onion powder...seasoning salt...cracked black pepper...this recipe can be as bland...or as seasoned as you like it......

I remember my mom making a very similar recipe when I was a kid, and it was one of my favorite dishes. I was finally able to find the recipe again here! I do increase the rice by about half a cup and add about a cup of milk with everything else (so there are two cups of liquid). Since you usually use twice as much water as rice, I think the extra  milk helps. Also, it is very important to cover this dish with foil while it cooks and to stir it about every 20-30 minutes or so. Stirring it will help the rice cook more evenly so you don't end up with crunchy rice, and I believe covering it helps keep the moisture in so that the liquid you want your rice to absorb doesn't end up as steam. If you follow those two rules, I think you'll have success with this recipe. It's a good no-fuss meal!

Oh, and I also mix the onion soup in with the rice mixture - I think it would be too strong just sprinkled on top, but mixed in it gives a good flavor.

This is an amazing recipe!  I've made it at least 10 times in the past 6 months and I never tire of it.  It's one of my husbands favorites!  I've used all different types of meat (chicken drumsticks, chicken breast, even pork chops!).  I also add in some sort of frozen vegetable -- usually defrosted spinach or broccoli.

Oooookaaay..I changed a few things up with this recipe and it turned out excellent in the end so maybe you might like to try this too. I precooked the rice so that eliminated the need for water. I used all ingredients listed and THEN added a tsp of cayenne pepper, a tbs of mustard, and 2 c of cheddar cheese to top it all off. I also used shredded chicken breasts and just stirred it and the onion soup mix in to the whole concoction. I mixed all ingredients and put it in the pan at the 350 and heated it through. This was wonderful...almost a completely new recipe but I still have to give the author credit for an excellent base recipe. The melted cheddar was awesome and the mustard and cayenne gave it a kick...oh...I also put a tsp of salt in it too. My whole fam loved it but since I had to add so much to add flavor I give it only a 4.

This turned out perfect. It was gorgeous (especially with the bright colored veggies i added in), and tasted very good, maybe a little plain. The rice was tender (DO NOT remove the foil), and it had to cook no longer than an hour and a half. The chicken (I used thin sliced) was very moist. I made some changes: I added a 10.5 ounce can of "fiesta corn" (a canned mix of corn and peppers) with only a little of the liquid from that added in. Then, i added a cup of frozen, defrosted peas. I also used 1/4 cup of white wine and 3/4 cup of water. Next time i might up this amount to make it equal, each a half cup. I added into the mixture a small amount of onion soup mix, which i would increase next time. Then, to top off the chicken, i mixed plain bread crumbs with dried basil, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and some more onion soup mix. If you use this bread topping, make a lot to cover the whole top. It adds a nice flavor to the chicken.At the end, to make it crisp up a bit, remove the foil, raise the temperature very high, and cook for a few more minutes. oh, also, i couldnt find cream of celery, so i used cream of chicken. Don't expect a dish with a lot of sauce. The rice soaks it all up, but that's what i expected. Very good dish. Family loved it. Will make again and again! You really didnt have to worry about it at all while it was in the oven. Jus DO NOT remove the foil during cooking! Make sure it is super sealed for maximum tenderness of the rice and chicken!

This was pretty good and real easy. I didn't find it too salty at all. I did mix the onion soup mix in with the other soups though. I added some broccoli too because I like the green stuff. I put it in the oven at about 200 degrees and let it cook for 3-4 hrs. I was out and this was great because the chicken just fell apart. My husband thought this was great too and it made great leftovers

Great recipe. I appreciate that the ingredients are common - making it quick to  put together. For better flavor I used CREAM OF CHICKEN & HERBS soup and one can of BROCCOLI CHEESE. The plain cream of chicken or mushroom does not have much flavor at all. I also used more water as others suggested so that the rice was cooked thoroughly. I used a WILD RICE mix (white, brown and wild rice) instead of just white rice, and topped with crushed whole wheat crackers. GREAT! Will definitely make many more time.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I used 2 cans of low-fat cream of mushroom soup and an 8 oz. can of mushrooms.  I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  This is a definite do-over at our house.  Thanks, Carol!

My family has been making this for years; we originally found it in a church fund raising cookbook.  The version we use, however, calls for cream of chicken and cream of celery soups, does not use mushrooms, calls for 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. pepper, and a whole chicken cut up.  I have also made it with boneless breasts, with leg quarters, just thighs - whatever.  You can add another 1/4 cup of water and use brown rice instead of white.  Dump in some frozen mixed veggies to make a one dish meal.  Oh, and the directions we use call for you to put the rice in the pan first, the chicken on top of that, mix everything else together and pour it over top.

This was really good.  I did change the recipe to match my preference.  I did not use mushrooms. I used 2 cans of the garlic cream of mushroom soups.  I used 2 cups Jasmine rice, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of milk.  I bought chicken thighs and boiled them on the stove for 15 minutes then shredded it and added it to the rice mixture.  I used half of the dry onion soup mix and mixed it in with the rice mixture.  I cooked it at 350 for 1 hr and 10 min.  Thanks for sharing.

I know this recipe as "Chicken Don't Peek"!!

The best to use is bone-in chicken pieces-breasts and thighs work best.  I use 3 cans of mushroom soup, with 1 3/4 cans of water poured around the chicken, to 2 cups of rice. I bake it in a greased roaster pan with lid.  RESIST the urge to check on it!!  Keep the oven closed for the entire time!  I also increase the cooking time by about 15 mins.  The rice is creamy, and the chicken is moist.  If only they could make a reduced salt, onion soup mix!!

Forewarned by other reviews, I cut back on the onion soup mix.  It was still a little salty, but tolerable.  In a packet of the brand of of onion soup mix I used, there was a total of 4880mg of sodium.  The daily recommended allowance of sodium is 2400mg.  Don't forget the soup mixes you're pouring in.  Of course, that's if you use the whole packet and eat the whole thing yourself.  Still, just to give an idea of the sodium we're eating here.  Overall it had a bit of a ramen noodle like taste. It wasn't a bad recipe, but an okay one...something I would never serve to a guest, but if I was rummaging around the cupboard I could come up with dinner really quickly with ingredients I already had.  Perhaps if the onion soup mix was replaced with onions sauteed in chicken/vegetable broth and you bought the healthy soups, this could even turn out to be a healthy and easy recipe as there is no added oils or butters.

I changed it up :) 2 cups rice (Of course! Need more rice) 2 cups water. 1 cup milk. (Yes, I have an extra cup of liquid which turned out perfect for me) Baked at 350 for 1.25 hours. I used thighs. Both soups I used cream of mushroom. I used a roaster pan with a lid and dumped everything into it and stirred it all up. I still used the 1 pack onion soup mix though.  This recipe was very close to a recipe I remembered having but lost which is why I made the changes. delish!

This was a great base recipe and turned out a bit better with some tweeking.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken.  I used 1 1/2 cups of rice and added one cup of milk to the water mixture. I didn't have mushrooms so I added one bag of frozen broccoli florets.  I cooked this mixture for 20 minutes then added the chicken breast halves.  It cooked for another 45 minutes and the rice mixture came out perfectly and the chicken was still moist.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I lightly sprinkled chiken bouillon granules over the chicken before baking.  My two toddlers devoured it and that's all I can ask for.

This was pretty good. I didn't use the whole packet of onion soup mix as it would have been too salty for us. To make up the difference, I added my own seasonings. I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces. The kids enjoyed it. This was a quick and easy meal. Thanks Carol!

I hesitate to even rate this since I changed it so much. I wanted to make it a little healthier so I used low fat, low sodium soups, brown rice, and used only about 1/3 of the onion soup mix. I also omitted the water completely and used 1 1/2 cups skim milk. I added about 1/2 the package of onion soup into the soup/rice mixture and then sprinkled a couple of teaspoons on top. I also used skinless drumsticks. I covered very tightly and baked for about 1 hour and 40 minutes than removed and let sit for another 10 minutes before removing the foil. The flavor was very good and not the least bit salty. And the nutty flavor of the brown rice with the soup mixture was very good. The chicken fell apart so I just mixed it all up before serving. However, like almost everyone else my rice was not cooked properly. I even used a heavy pampered chef 9x13 casserole dish and a convection oven to assure even baking. Ended up sprinkling some water over it and microwaving it for a couple of minutes to soften up the rice a little. It ended up pretty good but wish I could figure out how to fix the rice issue. You really aren't supposed to take the cover off while cooking rice but maybe stirring occassionally is the answer. I might try it next time.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. The onion soup topping was a bit much I thought. I also used cream of chicken instead of the cream of celery so maybe that was a mistake. My husband liked it though so I may try it again with a few changes.

I am sorry i followed this recipe the oninion mix was way too much reason being the water and rice ratio to the onion flavor wasn't enough it tasted way too much like onion and i ended up throwing away the rice and the whole thing was a flop and an embarrasement... i followed the recipe exactly.. i would really hold back on the onion soup and put in more rice...

Great recipe with record short prep time! I find it a bit too salty with just the canned and powdered soups -- low-sodium soup choices would not detract from the dish at all! I used fresh mushrooms, a wild/brown rice blend, cut the water in half (because of the water in the mushrooms), and added a half tsp of cayenne pepper.

This is an excellent and fast make ahead comfort food recipe. The changes I made was I mixed the dry onion soup mix in with the rice and had no complaints of being too salty. Also I added extra rice, about 1/2 a cup, and since I preprepped this in the morning, and read complaints of dry and cruncy rice, I used 3 cans of condensed soups (combo of cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, and cream of onion). It turned out very creamy and not dry at all. Family enjoyed it very much.

I enjoyed this dish and so did my husband.  However, I will be adding a few more spices to it the next time I prepare it.  I notice that some reviewers had trouble with the rice cooking all the way.  Many years ago my Mom told me that the secret that she found works for her when she is cooking rice that she uses in a heavier pot or pan.  That allows more even heating and so on.  For example, for this recipe I used a pyrex baking dish and the rice turned out perfect and the soups made a nice gravy.  The thinner baking pans have their uses of course, but changing the baking pan for this recipe might help.

This recipe is similar to the "Easy & Delicious Chicken & Rice Casserole" also found on this site. I changed this recipe around al little. First I only had cream of celery soup, so I used 2 cans of that. I skipped out on the mushrooms, didn't have any and we don't like them anyway. I added 2 chopped stalks of celery, 1 chopped onion, 2 or 3 TBSP of minced garlic (replacing the garlic powder), and I left out the onion soup mix. On the top of the chicken I sprinkled Creole Seasoning Blend, also found on this site. Baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours and the chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork. I have a similar recipe in a Betty Crocker book called "Chicken Atop Rice" and my husband said he loves this recipe w/my alterations so much more!!  Thanks Carol, for a good basic recipe. Next time I try adding a can of corn or greenbeans to the soup mixture for variation!!

Carol, thanks for such a yummy and easy recipe!  I did not find it to salty, but I did mix the onion soup mix in with the the rest of the ingredients and the chicken was perfect.  The best thing about this recipe is that it is made with staples that you always have in the house.  This is a keeper!  Oh, and my kids LOVED it!

This is a great recipe for busy parents of picky kids. My 3 kids just loved this. One of those kids has got to be the most picky eater of all of time. My kids are addicted to chicken legs so I used them instead of the breasts and it goes over so well at our house. The only thing with using legs is that the cooking time can be reduced to suit the smaller portion of meat. With this recipe;you can set it and forget it!!! ENJOY

This is a very good recipe and super easy too! I did change a couple of things for my preference - I don't care for cream of celery soup so I subbed cream of chicken. I also coated my chicken breasts in italian bread crumbs (although no breading would have been great). I also substituted quinoa for the rice (and added an additional cup of water because common ratio for rice or quinoa is 2:1.) I use quinoa instead of rice in a lot of recipes because of the amazing health benefits and to me, there is no taste difference! I highly recommend doing this and this recipe is a great way to try it out!

DO NOT USE THE ONION SOUP MIX! This flavor was way too overpowering. But without it, you'd have no flavor at all.  And the rice was still crunchy.  Not making it into the rotation...sorry.

I like the combination of flavors the cream of mushroom and celery create.  To spice it up I sauteed 2 shallots and mushrooms.  I also substituted white wine for the cup of water.  The rice came out almost like a risotto... which is great considering it's a lot less work.  The chicken however was a little on the dry side and REALLY bland.  Next time I may consider an extra can of cream of chicken to as well as some kind of marinade for the chicken.

Excellent!  My husband actually thanked me for being such a good cook...all because of this recipe!  So I do not know why some people have been downing this recipe, it's great.  I made it as written except I used more health concious brown rice and I added about 1/2 a cup more rice and water.  Also someone suggested putting the mushroom juice in the recipe instead of draining.  So with the mushroom juice, I did only add 1 cup of water.  I served Margaret Holmes turnip greens with the casserole.  It was easy and went well together.  Oh yeah, some people are mixing the onion soup mix in with the rest of the casserole and I would not recommend that...the soup mix is great on top, it makes the chicken taste wonderful.

My 14 year old loves this, so I gave it 5 stars.  Also because it is quick and easy for a week night supper.  I've made this several times and have at times added more liquid and rice because my son is a rice fiend.  Me, not so crazy about canned soup recipes in general, but this one really is pretty good.

This was a very easy recipe and it was delicious! I did make a few small changes. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. Since I used that I omitted the mushrooms. Also, instead of water I used milk. My husband loved it as well!

Loved this!!  Next time I'll double the rice.  I didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of chicken.  I think any cream soup would work well.  I also didn't have onion soup mix so I used a garlic dip mix and it worked fine.  I mixed the dip mix in with the rice instead of sprinkling on top.

Very good. Very quick to prepare. I used half breast and half thighs and lightly browned them in a coating of mexican spice rub before putting in the oven (in the end I prefered the thighs.) I also used low fat soups and increased the rice and water to 1.5 cups each. The consistency turned out perfect. For those that halved the recipe, the reason it overcooked was probably too much "space" in the 9x13 pan. For rice to cook properly, less space for air to circulate and a well-sealed top are important. Another pointer would be to use a quicker cooking rice (I used jasmine). After living in Japan for 3 years I can't stomach instant rice any more (call me a rice snob!) Heavier long grain or short grain rices won't cook through in the time provided.

Delicious.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  I did not use the entire envelope of onion soup.  Thanks for a winner.  I will make it again.

Great recipe!  Like many other reviewers, I've made some changes to the recipe that seem to have gone over well.  I find the original recipe a bit salty, so instead of onion soup I use Durkee fried onions.  About 10 minutes before its finished cooking I sprinkle the fried onions on top of the casserole.  This gives you the good onion flavor, and adds a little crunch to the dish.  I also use Uncle Ben's chicken rice instead of white (adds an enormous amount of extra flavor), and add peas, corn and carrots to the mix.

i've made this recipe countless times now with just a few changes: cut recipe in half & used only cream of chicken soup, used fresh mushrooms & added 1 cup mixed frozen veges, omitted the onion soup mix, seasoned chicken breasts with seasoned salt & Mrs. Dash original seasoning.

It was good, but a bit bland. I changed it by doubling the rice, using 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of mushroom. This kept everything moist. I also used 1/2 tsp each of lemon pepper, garlic salt (with parsley) and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. It was great.

I was trying to use up some pantry items before they expired and stumbled upon this recipe.  The end result was pretty good and filling.  I only had 4 breasts and 2 thighs, so that it was I used, and that actually worked well because I think it would've been too much chicken compared to the amount of rice if I'd used 8 breasts.  To get this dish on the table quicker, I would used already cooked rice and cooked and cubed/shredded chicken, throw everything together in the baking dish and bake just long enough to heat through.

I made this last week and my hubby wanted me to pick up the stuff to make it again. He LOVED it and he is a little on the picky side. He said it was better the next night reheated in the microwave at work. He said he thinks it was better than the first day!

Since some folks said this recipe was bland, I added fresh herbs that I had growing on the porch - sage and rosemary.  I think it was too much & probably would have tasted better bland.  In either case, my family did not like the consistency of this dish.  Rice too sticky.  Kinda all like chicken mush.

Love this Casserole, only thing I changed was cream of chicken instead of cream of celery, and I added peas. My nephew came for the weekend, I made it and was a little afaird he doesn't care for onions,  He loved it and I had to pass the recipe on to my sis, who made it for her family and they all loved it.

Made exactly as written, except that I added a few extra seasonings to spice up the chicken, and I only used half of the onion soup mix (we have picky eaters around here!) It came out just perfectly, I actually had to stop myself from eating the plate of it I was supposed to be saving for my husband! Thanks for a great recipe!

Not half bad, and definitely good for the amount of work (and dishes) involved.  I halved the recipe, using milk instead of water and only the cream of celery soup (mushroom would have been better, but I didn't have that on hand).  I added one tablespoon of soup mix to the filling and sprinkled the other over the top with a little bit of cheddar cheese.  The chicken was surprisingly flavorful!  I'll probably do this again.  There are so many chicken casserole recipes out there, but I don't think I have one that uses so few ingredients.

It's ok - everyone ate it.  However, it's bland.  Need to experiment with some seasonings.

This was a good and very easy recipe to make. I boiled my chicken before so that I could have shredded chicken in my recipe but it still took 1hour 20min to bake because of the rice. Also, next time I will leave out the onion soup my husband said it over powered the dish.

This recipe was quite tasty and really simple to make.  I only had 1/2 of a package of onion soup mix on hand, so I used that instead of a whole pkg and I mixed it in with the rice mixture as another reviewer suggested.  Turned out great and had just enough flavor.  Next time I make this, I will probably only used 1/2 package again.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It was very, very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  I added a bit more then a pinch of garlic powder and it gave it an underlined odd flavor but it was still good.  I mix my onion soup mix in with my rice mixture that is just me I think it makes the flavor better.  I also used instant rice.

This is a dish I've been making since I first moved out on my own. Extremely comforting and can be doubled/tripled depending on who shows up to your home to feed. You can also make this with two cans of tuna or leftover turkey. Any soup you have on hand'll work as well. Have leftover cooked veggies from the night before, throw 'em in! A rind of cheese you need to use? What the heck, throw that in, too. I add in just a spoonful of sour cream for a little creamier taste/texture.

I'm giving this recipe a five not because if prepared as is, it would be excellent, but because it is a great base recipe for chicken and rice.  I've toyed with chicken and rice for a long time, with mixed results.  This recipe made a great base recipe to which one should add ingredients that they like.  I added some broccoli, cheddar cheese, and a ritz cracker crust to the top of mine.  Our family enjoyed it and I liked the taste of the onion soup mix.  This will be my base recipe from here on out.

I didn't expect much out of this casserole but it actually turned out pretty good. I only used 3 chicken breasts and about half of the onion soup packet. I also used cream of broccoli soup in place of the cream of celery soup. Pretty good overall.

My family and I love this recipe, I did make some changes to it to adapt to my family's tastes. I didn't have cream of celery soup, so I substituted cream of chicken instead. I added one green bell pepper, diced, and one small onion diced to the rice mixture. I also added 1 minced garlic to the rice mixture. My family loved it. It was a great basic recipe that was easily changed to suit my family, thanks!

I read some of the other comments, about being too bland, too dry, & too salty. So here's what I did: I had to use what I had available, so... I mixed the soups, added 1 small onion- chopped, 2 large fresh mushrooms-chopped, sprinkled in a little garlic powder (sorry, didn't measure) then I added 1 c. rice & 2c. milk. I put that in the pan. I added 1/4 bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower, carrot mix and 1/4 bag of frozen red, yellow, & green peppers. I figured, as they "thawed", it would add extra moisture. I added the chicken breasts. I can't have salt, so I sprinkled the top with onion powder & pepper. After it baked a few minutes, I spooned the soup over the chicken breasts, to help keep it moist. The only problem there was the rice that landed on top of the chicken was a little crunchy! lol. Other than that, it was creamy & delicious! My husband, who doesn't like chicken breasts, went back for seconds and couldn't wait for me to heat it back up today! After dinner, I diced up the remaining chicken breasts and stirred it back in. It may have been a little better for the rice if I had used 2 1/2 c. of milk. To make this even easier, you could use left over chicken diced up, or even easier still, use canned chicken breast. Over all: my family loved this meal, it was creamy, healthy, delicious! I know I will be making this again!

I gave this a 5 because it is a very simple recipe. That makes it soo easy to sub ingredients to your taste! I used a V8 Butternut Squash soup and some chicken broth instead of the 'cream of's, left out the mushrooms(preference), and added celery for some, but not too much, crunch. Only baked it for about 45 mins. The rice still came out too soft, but the flavor was awesome! Perhaps I'll cook it only 30 mins next time for this variation.
This will be in my recipie box for sure... and I can't wait to try numerous flavor variations!

Thanks!

I changed a few things about this recipe due to others' comments. I used cream of chicken w/herbs & broccoli cheese soups. Instead of mushrooms, I added 2 cups of frozen broccoli florets. I used 1 cup of brown rice (make sure it's parboiled) so I increased the water to 2 cups (well, I used chicken broth). All I did was sprinkle salt & pepper on the SIX chicken breasts and I baked it at 350 for 1 hour. It was great!

This is fantastic. I made a couple small changes. I used milk instead of the water (makes it creamier) and I threw some shredded Cheddar cheese on top when it was just about done.

Great comfort food!  This was easy and my husband loved it.  I also loved it, but having so much salt just makes me a little cautious.  Things I did differently:  I baked it at 350 for 1 hour.  I used instant rice, and it cooked through and was not crunchy.  I added french fried onions and italian bread crumbs on top as a reviewer below suggested.  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups.  I added a little more garlic powder.  I only sprinkled a tad of the onion soup mix over the chicken.  I also sprinkled a little cajun seasoninig.  Next time, I think I am going to use 1 1/2 c. rice and 1 1/2 c. water because my only complaint is there wasn't enough rice.  This makes a 9x13 dish and my husband and I ate it for dinner on Wednesday night and we finished off the leftovers on Thursday.  I will definitely make this again.

I used low fat soups and fresh mushrooms in the base layer.  I sprinkled the chicken with spices (to your tastes) and used french fried onions w/o the onion soup mix.  I also sprinkled some italian bread crumbs and this recipe was amazing!!!  It was so much better than I expected!  Thank you!  This went in to my "family cookbook" immediately.

This got a "Just OK" rating from my family. I think it was the onion soup on top that we didn't care for. If I made this recipe again, I would probably just add the French's Onions on top instead of the onion soup mix.

Very easy and very good. I added only half a cup of water and then added half a cup of white wine. I also used chicken tenders and put them underneath the rice and soup mixture. The chicken got so tender that it fell apart and mixed very nicely into the rice.

This was disappointing. So many good reviews but we didn't like it. The onion soup was too salty and overpowering. Maybe using just half the packet would help, as well as adding some spices to the rice mixture.

I made this last night, and it was OH SO GOOD!! My husband and I, plus the neighbors, LOVED it. This recipe was one of the EASIEST I have ever done.  The only thing I added was 3/4 cup minced fresh onion. I will for sure make this again and again.

True comfort food. Thanks, Carol!  Kudos & 5 stars because it's that good just as written!  You can trust this over and over again, and come up with ways to just make it "yours". The key to success is covering it so it's airtight. NO PEEKING. I recommend using whole chicken breasts for this and for any chicken dish that's not being used in a sandwich; just remove the skin & the fat. Simply pull it off, no big deal. The flavor that comes from using meat on the bones is going to blow your mind.  Boneless, skinless meat of any kind is a loser in flavorland.  We always have to pile on something for flavor; am I right?  Bones are good in baking, roasting, grilling, stewing, every manor of cooking meat; fat is incorrect.  Let me know if you agree. I substitute wine for half the water called for, sometimes just 1/3.  I'm not a wine snob, either. I admit to keeping "cooking wine" in my fridge and using it, especially Cooking Sherry. Just get some into the mix and you'll be amazed. I also recommend using only half the onion soup mix because it's so flippin' salty. There's plenty of flavor in using half that stuff in ANY recipe that calls for it.  It's good stuff though, no doubt about it. If I'm out of the onion soup mix, I use a splash Soy Sauce or liquid smoke, maybe some Worcestershire or Kitchen Bouquet & hit it with smoked Paprkia, which is great with the wine I add.  There's tons of wiggle room in every recipe. This recipe from Carol is elegant enough for company.  All American!

This was pretty good and very easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did use low sodium soup for the mushroom but couldn't find it for the celery.  The only thing I changed was to use lean loin chops instead of chicken.  I thought it was a little salty and would probably cut out the onion soup next time but I loved the creamy rice.  Will make again!  Thanks! :O)

This was great, easy prep and clean up. I am sure that it is good just the way it is. Being a farm wife and mother of 4 I don't always have everything I need when it comes time to wip supper up and we live 20 min from the store. So here is what I did.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom 1 can of chicken gravy, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tea of mustard (I seen on another review) Brown rice I did not have instant so I cooked it about 3/4 of the way first, I only used about 3/4 of onion soup mix a pinch of garlic pinch of salt 1/2 tea hot shot pepper and after 45 min I pulled the foil off and added 2 cups of cheddar cheese baked another 15 min.

why 3 stars? + convenient, easy to make, but B-L-A-N-D!!!!!! as written -- you'll need to jazz it up! Add LOTS more garlic powder or a couple minced garlic cloves, easy! Adding sauteed (or in a pinch, dried minced onion) is necessary, too. I'd also reccomend adding 1/2-3/4c milk to the mix. I liked the results of chopping the chicken into bite size pieces, pre-browning it in a pan & mixing the whole thing together & cooked for about 1 hr 15 min. Still, needs a lot more help to even become SATISFYING & Tastey. If you try to jazz it up, don't add a pinch of something, add a LOT!

I made this dish, and after about an hour in the oven the rice was not done. I added a cup of water, and the dish turned out great. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. Family loved it, and easy for me to make with a family of 6!!!!!

Excellent family dinner - easy and acceptable to picky eatters.  I made only the following changes: used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery - just bc that is what I had; used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and did stir in the onion soup mix instead of sprinkling on top.  I also sprinkled the top of the chicken breasts with seasoned salt.  Then, I cooked at 315 for 2 hours just because it fit my schedule better that way.  Yummy with a fresh salad and cottage cheese.

Recipw was season good I mixed the onion mix with rest of the ingredients....Came out to mushy. The last 10 minutes I uncovered the dish to let dry out the rice. Maybe use only I  can of cream of chicken soup next time. I substituted the cream of celery for cream of chicken soup. Mixing the onion soup mix into the main ingredients turned the color of rice mixture brown.

This was a pretty good recipe, but not fantastic. My fiance liked it, but didn't love it. I tried adding some cayenne pepper based on recommendations, but even with only a little bit, it was out-of-place. Fiance also thought it was on the bland side, like what a lot of reviewers said, even though I added more garlic than what was called for, a handful of grated cheese, and some frozen veggies. I also mixed half of the onion soup packet in with the rice mixture. Our suggestion for next time is sundried tomatoes for some flavor. But the rice was smooth and creamy, a definite comfort food that I'm sure I will make again.

It is very easy to make, I will give it that.  It was not a hit at my house at all.  Not terrible but not something that I will make again.  It probably would have been better with maybe some broccoli added to it.

I have made a similar recipe for many years. I always use bone-in chicken. Also you can add chopped celery. I bake it for about 2 hours at 350 degrees. It is a great dish to bring to a potluck or many times I have made it for friends who are in need of meals after the birth of a baby or any time someone can use some extra help. Everyone loves it.

I thought this was a nice simple recipe.  Easy to make and cooked perfectly in about 75 minutes.  I did add half of the dry soup mix to the rice mixture to more evenly distribute, but other than that, I followed exactly.

The idea of baking uncooked rice made me nervous but I covered the dish in foil and didn't touch it for 1hr 20m. I'm glad I did because the rice was awesome. I did not add the canned mushrooms or onion soup but did add a little chili powder to the mix. I layered some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the mix, added the chicken and a last light sprinkle of onion powder. Next time I'll try different soups and cheeses just to mix it up.

Great! So easy! I did not have the mushrooms so didn't add them. But I did add a bag of frozen mixed vegtables and Fried onion rings on top! Wonderful! All here loved it which is amazing as some do not like casseroles. This is a keeper and I have already passed it on to my future daughter-in-law to use!

This is a warm, cozy, comfort food made simple and easy. It looked and smelled appetizing as well.
I added a little extra seasoning, thinking it would need it; a misjudgement on my part.(The soups are salty enough.)
We ate and enjoyed regardless and my husband even went back for seconds.
Next time, (and there will be a next time.)I will follow the recipe exactly. This would be great dish for a pot luck dinner.

This is very quick to prepare.  We cut the recipe in half.  Rather than use ½ can of two kinds of soup, we only used the mushroom soup.  Also, we added chopped celery and carrots.  I would definitely add the fresh veggies next time, and maybe switch to brown rice.

Overall, this was a very good recipe.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but I sauteed the chicken first, added fat free milk instead of water, and put about half of the onion mix into the rice mixture since previous reviews said it was too salty with the full packet.  It came out creamy and delicious, my family really like it too. My only complaint was that it was a little bland, it needs a little "kick" from something, I'll have to experiment next time.

Quick Recipe, but would recommend adding milk and extra rice.  Check about half way through cooking and add water if necessary.  Even with the extra milk the rice mixture was drying out.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but my kids refused to eat this.  I've never been a fan of 'Onion Soup' anything so I'm not sure why I thought we would like it.  It looked so easy, so I really really wanted it to work out.

used minced garlic instead of powder; used white wine instead of water. Mixed all together (sauce ingredients) and poured over chopped asparagus in a baking dish. Saved some sauce to place over the chicken, then added the dry soup. Was good, but asparagus not cooked well even after 1 1/2 hours. Will try this with green beans next time. White wine was definitely the key addition here!!

Of the many variations of this recipe out there, this proved to be a reliable, easy version.  I thought I was so smart using a can of cream of chicken soup since I did not have the celery soup and then came on the site and saw at least 30 other cooks did the same thing!  If one is pressed for time and needs to be able to count on the outcome, try this recipe and don't worry about goosing it up, it works just fine the way it is.

Great "comfort" food with the rice in the mix. Our family really enjoyed this casserole. I added frozen baby carrots and green beans to the soup mixture to make it a "one dish" meal. Also, the chicken breast I used were FROZEN so I set the oven to 350 degrees. Everything turned out great - the chicken, rice, and veggies. Yum...

Had I followed the recipe exactly, it would have been a disaster. I used twice as much (if not more) water and only that ensured that the casserole wasn't dry.
I used a second can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Celery and frozen peas instead of mushrooms. I also added a little bit of Soy sauce for extra flavor. Delicious!!

Overall, this recipe was very good and very easy.  I used cream of chicken instead of the cream of mushroom (I like the flavor better) and used chicken tenders.  While I like the Onion Soup Mix topping, I think next time I will crumble some butter crackers and use that for topping instead.

Excellent! I followed others advice on: browning chicken with onion and garlic, using 1/2 milk 1/2 water-omitted cream of celery, mixing the onion soup mix in with the dish and topping with breadcrumbs. YUM!! --very comforting dish!

I was looking for a version of my mother's chicken rice casserole (a favorite of mine as a child) and found this - it's a more "grown up" version of hers, and a new favorite with my family. I made a half recipe, so omitted the can of cream of celery soup, but used a teaspoon or so of celery salt in it's place. Followed another reviewer's edits and used half milk, half cup of water, also mixed half of the onion soup mix into the rice, sprinkled the rest on top with some bread crumbs. Heavenly comfort food!

I made this dish because I was having a "busy day".  I got home whipped this meal together, threw it in the oven and took my son to baseball practice.  We got home 1 hour and 15 minutes later.  By the time we set the table the food was ready.  The chicken was tender and the rice cooked perfectly.  I will make this again!

I didn't have Cream of Celery so I used Cream of Brocoli - turned out fine.  I also used 1/2 brown rice and 1 cup white rice.

This was a very good recipe. We didn't have cream of musroom so we used 2 cans of cream of chicken with herbs. Also we used 2 cups of uncooked rice and one can of Swanson chicken broth in place of the water. I mixed half of the onion soup mix in the soup mixture and sprinkled the rest on the chicken. Also, we did not put mushrooms in as my boyfriend hates mushrooms. Finally, we used 4 whole chicken breasts and baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the suggestions of others and did the following:

- rinsed the rice
- used 2/3 packet of dry onion soup
- made more rice ( 1.5 cups rice and 1.5 cups water)
- seasoned with cayenne (just a little)
- added 2 cloves crushed garlic to the rice
- cooked at 350 instead of 325 to prevent crunchy rice

This was a wonderful family meal. Easy to put together. I stirred the casserole after 1 hr, then cooked for another 20 minutes.  The rice was cooked to perfection, but the sauce a tad sticky.  I sprinkled a tiny bit of water on it and that made it perfect!!

Will make this again - thank you!

I would suggest actually cutting the chicken up into more bite size pieces to make it easier to eat.  I'd also suggest mixing the dried soup mix in and maybe using a little less.  Sprinkling it on top made for some very salty portions.  All in all it was a very good taste and very easy to make.  I made mine up on Sunday and then baked it on Monday after work.

I made this for dinner last week and we really liked it.  I followed some of the previous reviewers advice and made sure to rinse my rice and I also added some italian bread crumbs.  It was not too salty for me, but I have a tendency to like a lot of salt.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I didn't follow it exactley. Since I was only cooking for my husband and myself, I used two chicken breasts.We used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, mushrooms, water, garlic powder, and since I have the same problem with regular rice not being done enough, I used instant rice.Also, since there were many complaints about the onion soup making the dish too salty, I omitted it altogether. I did add two cups of frozen mixed vegetables, and sprinkled breadcrumbs on top. I had to cook it about 1 hour 10 minutes, and it came out great. I'll be making this recipe again!

I made this recipie and did not have the mushrooms to add, which was ok because of the cream of mushroom soup. I did, however add approximately 2 tsp Lawry's Seasoned Pepper, 1 tsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt and 1 tsp Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic instead of the "pinch" of garlic powder. I also sprinkled the seasoned bread crumbs on top before serving. My whole family, including my picky 8 year old LOVED THIS!

I thought this actually turned out better than I expected. With just those couple of ingredients you would think it would be bland, but the chicken was very moist and the rice was also delicious.

This came out better than I expected. I used brocolli cheese soup instead of celery soup and french's onions instead of onion soup mix. I sprinkled a little cayenne on the chicken pieces too. The key to cooking to rice all the way is to rinse it first.

This recipe is so easy and O so good.  I used 98% fat free and low sodium soups and it came out great.  Make sure to check the rice is done because my chicken was done but the rice needed to cook a little longer.  The second time I made it with Jasmine Thai sticky rice and it came out awesome.  Will certainly be making this one many more times.  Its hard to find a lo-fat yummy recipe and this one most definitely fits the bill!

Quick, easy, and quite good. I don't make any changes to this recipe. I love the fact that it goes together 1-2-3, into the oven, and then can be ignored until it's time to eat. Great recipe, thank you!

I am very impressed with this recipe. I am dieting and trying to find some decent recipes. I changed a couple of things seeing I only used 2 chicken breasts. I used one can of 98% fat free mushroom soup and half the water and rice. For the rice I used instant brown rice and it worked well. I finally found a great light recipe that is extrememly easy and tastes great!

Great dish for working women. Very quick. Made this tonight but didn't have any white rice so used a box of Uncle Bens wild rice (used the flavor packet also). Came out very flavorful. My husband and I both loved it. There will be leftovers even for tomorrow!! Would make again.

This recipe was a snap to make.  I did have to make a couple of changes.  Beacause I didn't have cream of celery, I used cream of chicken soup.  I had chicken breast tenders on hand instead of halves.  I baked mine in a pyrex dish with a glass lid.  I think maybe some of the reviewers who had problems with mushy or crunchy rice would have done better with a dish with a lid instead of covering with foil.  My rice turned out perfect!  The thing my family did not care for was the taste of the onion soup mix.  We found it way to salty and overpowering.  As a result, we didn't mix it into the rice and sort of just scraped it off the chicken to get through dinner.  I think it might be better to cover the chicken with a little of the soup mixture and sprinkle with bread crumbs.   5 stars for easy to prepare, barely two for overall taste because of the onion soup topping.

Easy and tastes great! I have made this recipe for years, except normally I use Uncle Bens Long Grain wild rice with herbs. 
The rice tastes so good that I can barely get my family  to eat the chicken! I think I'm going to double the rice part next time I make this.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! Every time I have made it I have had kids and adults alike rave about it and ask for the recipe. The only thing I do differently is that I double the soups, rice and water. There didn't seem to be enough rice mix the original way.

The rice didn't cook in the 1-1/2 hours in the oven - nothing's worse than a Chicken-Rice casserole with CRUNCHY rice. Also, the liquid didn't get soaked up or evaporated or whatever SHOULD have happened - so, I ended up with heavy-onion-soup-mix-tasting, chicken soup with crunchy rice. Ack. Shortcuts are great, when they work. This one doesn't work.

This receipe is awesome.  It takes little time to prepare, stick it in the oven and 2 hrs later a delicious dinner.  I don't use the celery soup because it makes it to soupy.  EXCELLENT DISH!!

I enjoyed this recipe.  The only changes I made were that I greased the baking dish and I used stovetop instead of the onion soup to sprinkle over top.  I would make it again.

Yummy.  I used 2 large chicken breasts and cut them up into bit sized pieces which I mixed with everything else.  I mixed the onion soup mix into everything as well and added a little chopped celery.  Baked it at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes and it was delicious!

This turned out awesome! My family loved it I used 2 cans mushroom soup. I also did a baked brown rice version for those that didn't like white with 2 cups rice and 3 cups water with chicken and 1 whole package onion soup sprinkled and garlic powder sprinkled.

This is really easy to make but a little bland and can be healthier. The first time the rice was overcooked.  I mixed in about a 1/2c of fat free sour cream which helped the rice, and used fat free soups.  Used brown rice.  We dont like mushrooms so I didnt add them.  Little extra garlic powder, onion powder, & pinch of Old Bay in soup mix.  I kinda pile up the Liptons onion soup mix on top of just the chicken.  It makes a yummy crusty top of the chicken and doesnt make the rice too salty.

I changed it a little. I used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery. I omitted the can of mushrooms and dry onion soup mix. Instead, I topped it with French Fried onions. It came out fantastic. And super easy.

I didn't have mushroom so used fresh broccoli. Instead of the dry onion soup mix as a topping I mixed together cornmeal, garlic powder, and Cavender's. We will definitely have this again!

Great recipe!  I skipped the garlic & pepper, but used 1 cup Fat Free/Low Sodium chicken broth instead of water.  This made for a rich chicken flavor through/out the dish.  I also cooked it for 2-1/2 hours, allowing the rice to soak up more flavor and to cook completely.  Chicken was nice and moist.  This dish received rave reviews by family who is familiar with the dish as listed per recipe.  They claimed it was much better with my alterations :)

Love this recipe. It's so easy to make and turns out delicious. I add a 1/4 tsp of Thyme to mine and real garlic (one clove).

It's a mystery to me why this recipe is so highly rated. I consider myself a decent cook, and this was a total flop. First of all, the cooking time is off.. My rice was hard and crunchy after the noted time. I had to cook for an add'l 30 minutes on increased temp. Secondly, its so bland! There is absolutely NO flavor..  The rice absorbs all of the soup, and there is no flavor left. There is no creaminess- Its just mushy rice with chicken.. Sorry! I am staring at it trying to figure out how I am going to re-coop this dish for dinner... ( I even added extra bite size vegetables before cooking.. )- Just isn't working for me!

This dish was quite satisfying. I did alter the recipe a bit to suit my tastes. I used cream of chicken soup in place of cream of mushroom. Also, I used 1 1/2 cups of wild rice combined with 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup Pinot Blanc. The whole family enjoyed this casserole, even our persnickety 10-year old! I will definitely make this again!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I have been making it for about 5 years now and they love it every time.  I am making it today in my restaurant for the second time and last time I got rave reviews.  The flavors really mix well together.  I also fix lunch daily for a group of men and they frequently request this recipe. I make it as is with no substitutions.  Good job, Carol!!

comfort food at it's best, You got to love a recipe that is just all thrown together and when it's done makes your taste buds sing, the only part I changed is I used a whole chicken.... It makes the recipe much cheaper and when your feeding a family of five the cheaper the better

This recipe was very easy to make.  I left out the mushrooms, since I didn't have any.  I used chicken tenders, rather than whole boneless breasts.  The chicken was so tender you could cut it with your fork.  The rice, however, was so "globby."  I'm not a big casserole fan, so perhaps that's just the way casserole rice turns out.  My kids and husband ate the chicken.  I ate some of the rice, but didn't save the leftovers, as I like my rice drier than that.  I used low-sodium soups, except for the dry soup mix.  That made the dish too salty, in my opinion.  I wouldn't make this again, but probably if you like casseroles, you'll like this dish.

I liked this recipe a lot but my boyfriend loved it! It was a little too salty for me but it is a greaty little casserole that you can change things to make it suitable for you. I put cream of celery, cream of mushroom & cream of chicken w/ herbs in mine & I believe thats why it was a little to salty. Maybe next time I will do half of the cream of herbs. I will still be making this in our home.

It came out a little watery. I followed the recipe just like it said, but I think it needed more rice to soak up some of the liquid.

I really love this recipe because it's easy to cook and "make your own".  I'm just not a fan of the onion soup mix, but my husband thought it that the one time I added the soup mix produced the best chicken rice casserole I ever made.

This recipe was great but I did make a few changes... I seared & seasoned my chicken breast b4 I cut them up, used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of celery soup, the onion soup packet and 1/2 way cooked my rice so that it wouldn't used up all of the liquid, cut the cooking time in half & about 15 mins before it was done i sprinkled bread crumbs on top and drizzled some melted butter... the whole family loved it!

This was really good.  I did a few things differently:  I only used 4 chicken breasts and I sprinkled half of the soup mix over the chicken and the other half, I mixed into the rice mix.  I think that distributed the sodium of the soup better, it wasn't too salty at all...I also used lower sodium mushroom soup, so that helped.  I baked the whole thing for 75 minutes and the chicken came out perfect and the rice was done on the verge of being a little overdone.  This was so simple and I will definitely make again when I don't feel like cooking but can't afford to eat out!

This was really good, and very quick to put together.  I made a couple of changes (who doesn't?)  I used chicken breast tenders and pre-cooked my rice to reduce the cooking time.  Even so, it seemed a little dry to me, so I added some milk to the rice/soup/soup mix mixture to thin it out a bit, and grated some Gouda cheese on top.  It was a big hit with my daughter's fiance, who LOVES anything made with rice.  One warning...you will have some WICKED onion breath the next day, due to the onion soup mix.  Since we'd all eaten the same thing, nobody in my family cared, but I wouldn't want to go out in public too soon after eating this!

I grew up with my mom making this meal and it is just too good! I have a very picky hubby so yes, I did make some modifications. First off I browned the chicken breasts in olive oil on high heat (just my preference), I only used cream of celery soup (he hates mushrooms), did not add the can of mushrooms, and used the veggie soup mix instead of the onion mix. Oh, I sprinkled seasoning salt on top before I baked it. It was a comforting meal on a cold rainy night, and best of all my picky guy loved it!

This was okay.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and mixed everything together with chicen that I par-boiled first, but the dry onion soup mix was too much... and I didn't even use the whole thing.  I thought it made the whole recipe taste like the soup mix.  I would try it without the soup mix and add some veggies and maybe french-fried onions on top to give it some crunch.  It tasted a little mushy to me.

Not a family fave in this house.  Kids and husband refused to eat it.  The smell overpowered the entire 1st floor and my clothes.  I ate it.  It was very salty because of the dry soup mix.  :(  On the bright side, it was very easy to make...I just won't be making it again.

I hate to be a contrarian, but we didn't really like this recipe. Sure, it was easy, but -- as my husband said -- it tasted like we were eating the straight soup mix. I may try this again and mix the soup mix into the rice mixture.

This is one of the dishes that I've always thrown together (the soup, chicken, rice and whatever else), and have never been too proud of the results.  But this recipe is right on.  I will also confess that I already had cooked leftover chicken that I used instead of the raw chicken breasts, and I cooked the rice ahead.  I stirred the cooked chicken and rice together with the other ingredients (minus the water), put the dry soup on top and baked it, covered, at 350 for 40 minutes.  It's the best!  I will always use this recipe as a guide to make this dish from now on.

This was yummy and very hearty, though I will not use the entire can of cream of mushroom soup the next time - a little too liquidy and too much mushroom flavor.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. Very easy to prepare. I didn't use the dry onion soup mix because I didn't have any. I added some seasoned salt and minced onion to the rice. And instead of cream of celery soup I used cream of chicken.

I loved this, I didn't change a thing with the recipe. Very easy to make and so yummy. I used chicken tenders. When it was done baking I used a fork and cut them into bite sized pieces right in the dish then mixed it all together. I will make this on a regular basis.

Very easy recipe.  I didn't have any mushrooms.  For creamier rice, I used 1/2 c milk and 1/2c water. I put a little bit of the onion soup mix into the rice mixture.  I also used some dry ranch dressing mix (Hidden Valley)in the rice and sprinkled some of the dry ranch dressing on the chicken.  Did not want to use all that onion soup.  I also only used 4 breasts...but kept the rice the same.  If I had more breast, I'd probably increase the rice.  I gave it 5 stars because it was an easy basic recipe that you can adjust to your taste.  I'm used to browning chicken first and found that you didn't have to with this recipe...what a timesaver!

after reading reviews for this recipe, i amended it a lot.  i used 2 cups of rice, added 1/4 cup white wine and an extra cup or water and did just cream of mushroom, plus garlic powed, celery salt and a mix of dried peppers to spice it up a bit. oh, i also used canned white chicken meat (2 cans) instead of the chicken breasts since i didn't have any.  i didn't have chicken soup mixture, so i used this stuff i have called 'adobo completo' for seasoning, but it ended up being too salty (my fault!), so i tried to rescue it w/ some brown sugar.  my hubby still liked it, but i am a tough critic and thought it too salty.  i will cook this again and not add too much salty seasoning and it will be just fine! i give the recipe a 4 b/c it is indeed simple, but there were quite a few tweeks that needed to be made to perfect it...  thanks for the starting point though!  :)

Any recipe that makes my hubby emit an "Mmm" after the first bite, gets a good rating from me! I did make a couple of changes, though, which is why I'm only giving the recipe, as written, 4 stars. I didn't have any cream of celery, so I used a can of cream of mushroom and left out the mushrooms in the recipe. Also, after reading the reviews about the casserole being bland, I used more than a pinch of garlic powder and also added a little reduced sodium seasoned salt. I sprinkled a bit of the seasonings on top of the chicken as well. Delicious!

I tried this recipe on one of many "busy days" as a mother of 2 and it was so easy (prep was 5 minutes) and came out delicious. I added peas to the recipe and used uncooked brown rice instead of white rice as a healthy alternative. The brown rice cooked very fluffy and soft so I couldn't tell the difference. The other plus about this recipe is that all ingredients cost under $15.00 but doesn't taste like it! It would also be perfectly fine to make when having company over for dinner. I e-mailed this recipe out and all who made it gave a thumbs up!!!

Followed other reviewer suggestions and added an additional 1/2 cup of rice and 1 cup of milk.  Also, didn't have dry onion soup mix so I added 2 tsp of Season All for flavor.  It is necessary to stir every 30 minutes in order for the rice to cook thoroughly.  This recipe replaces my old chicken and rice recipe.  Thanks!

This was FANTASTIC.  My husband hates mushrooms so I didn't add any and I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup.  I also cut the rice and H2O in half.  I used chicken tenerloins.  It cooked for 1 hour and was juicy and the rice cooked through.  It worked out great as far as servings go seeing as it's only my husband, myself and our 4 year old.

I think i actually screwed up by putting the onion soup mix in with the cream of mushroom mix.  It worked out great though.  My 5 year old went back for the rice 3 times.  I also tried cranberry flavored raisins in half and green beans in the other half of the rice.  Both were so good.  easy and quick.  I used drumsticks and thighs.  One other thing is i covered it for the first half and uncovered for the other.

This very easy recipe was a hit!  It was perfect for a rainy night.

After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments. I sauteed about 1/4 of a large onion and a big rib of celery that I added to the soup/rice mixutre, I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces, & I used only half a packet of onion soup.  I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes, gave the whole thing a stir, replaced the foil and baked it another 15 minutes.  

This will be added to my winter monthly menu.

Will make again! I used cream of chicken in place of cream of celery because it is what I had on hand. I also added 1 extra cup of water and mixed the onion soup mix in with the rice mixture as other reviewers had suggested.  Next time I may reduce the onion soup mix to about a half a pack. My husband loved it but I generally find that onion soup mix is very strong. This turned out great, even my picky three year old ate it! Great recipe!

Awesome !!  Tried the fried onion and garlic in oil first as someone suggested, then browned the chicken in same oil with seasoning salt. The casserole came out perfect.  Thank you.

For a canned soup cassarole, this was very good.  Left out the mushrooms and only used about a half-package of the (french) onion soup mix.  Really liked how the chicken had a very tasty 'topping' from the mix.  Easy, warming, filling.  Next time, will probably add some fr. vegatables in with the rice; maybe broccoli.

This was really good and really easy. I only used 4 chicken breasts instead of 8 (they were big ones) and used broccoli instead of mushrooms. While this is very tasty and we WILL have it again, you should take note of how much salt is has. We were still drinking water well into the evening. IT's good, but beware!

A little salty for my taste, but not bad. It's certainly quick and easy. I used Cream of Broccoli soup, which worked very well with a side dish of california blend vegetables. This could easily be adapted for any meat.

Very delicious and came together so fast!  I added a bag of frozen veggies and should have then used a little less water.  Excellent recipe and will be a family repeat!!

I thought this recipe was just OK for me.  After all the time in the oven and the wonderful smell that filled my house I couldn't wait to eat it.  To my disappointment the smell was far better than the actual taste and it was very mushy and heavy.  Perhaps next time I will try to add something else to give it a bit more flavor.

This was okay.  Probably won't make it again.  Not much taste, quite salty.  Not sure what changes could be made to make this better.

Very good!  A little salty tho, so maybe I'll try to get low-sodium soups next time.  However, would definitely make again because it was so easy!

There is no doubt that this recipe deserves a five star rating. WoW!  I put it together in less than 3 minutes. It took longer for my oven to preheat.  I cooked it for an hour an a half because I have a fear of undercooked chicken. But it turned out perfect.  My husband loved it. My 3 year old son woke up this morning and wanted leftovers for breakfast!  And my 12 month old daughter loved the rice.  Will definately be a regular on our menu.  Thanks for such a easy, fast, and tasty meal!

much like my mom used to make, this is easy and tasty.  I usually add a few stalks of celery and a carrot or two.  

I also usually make corn bread (jiffy muffin mix) and crumble it on top and cook uncovered for the last 20 minutes.  Got that idea from the "chicken stuff" recipe here.  

I add half an onion (chopped) to the mixture if i do this to make up for the missing onion soup.

It's a great meal to fix when you are on the run, especially after a long day at work.  I actually topped mine with a little breadcrumbs and cheddar cheese instead of the dried french onion soup.  Seeing that's the ingredient I forgot at the store, I had to get creative.  Great recipe, it will definitely be made again!

This is a hit in my house full of teenage boys who are hard to please.  I make a couple of changes - instead of celery soup I use cream of chicken.  Also, I omit the mushrooms and I use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  They love this so much they eat any leftovers for breakfast the next morning .  It is super easy too.

I mixed all ingredients together with the rice, adding 1 tsp of cayenne and a TBS of dry mustard, lay the chicken on top and topped with grated cheese.  I cooked it uncovered for about 35 minutes.  I had no problems at all with the rice; it was perfect.  I wasn't expecting much from my family...but they RAVED!!  Even my oh so finicky 5 year old.  She ate 2 helpings!!!  And remarked that she hoped there were leftovers for the next dinner...that was a first.  Thank you for an easy crowd pleaser.

I have used A recipe very close to this for years for chicken and wild game cooking. For 8 1/2 chicken breasts I would use A larger baking dish, maybe 12/17 inch. Take 2 2/3 cups of white minute rice. Just dump it in the baking dish, and shake it gently to spread it out evenly. Place washed and dried chicken on top. In A large bowl mix 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 2 cans cream of celery, 3 1/4 cups of water. Pour mixture over chicken and rice. Sprinkle 1 or 2 packs of dry onion soup mix on top. Seal tight with foil, and bake at 350 Deg. for 1 1/2 hours. Remove foil bake 20 minutes or so longer to brown. I have never had A problem with the rice. Maybe I will try the garlic powder and mushrooms next time. Thanks Carol!!!

The chicken it self was wonderful however next time I'm cutting down the onion soup.  The rice didn't cook all the way through though so I'm going to try cooking it half way first.  The rice was also a little bland but nothing that a few extra spices and more vegies wouldn't fix.

By far this was the eaisiets meal I have ever made!  And yummy, too!  My husband and I are not big mushroom fans, so I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken soup and didn't add the can of mushrooms and it was excellent.  My husband loved it!  Thanks Carol!

I tried this recipe with the low-salt soups and mixed some of the onion soup in the mixture.  My kids loved it but I had a hard time with the cooking.  I set the temp a little higher (hungry kids moaning) and it did not cook completely in the alloted time.  I turned the temp up again and the chicken got a little tough.  I will try it again sometime, though.

Not bad with a few adjustments.  I added cheese and Italian breadcrumbs to the top about 20 minutes before taking out of the oven.  FOr the last 7-8 minutes, I left it uncovered.  I only used 2/3 package of onion soup.  Not bad, but not something I'll cook very often.

Since the recipe requires working with raw chicken, I wouldn't let the kids do that part, but they could help do the rest of the measuring and dumping!

I tried this recipe last night and we loved it.  This is definitely a keeper. The only difference was that I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.
It cooked about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  The dry soup mix over the top adds a lot to the flavor of the chicken!  I really liked throwing it together in minutes and leaving the kitchen.  Thank you!

This recipe was yummy! My 8 year old gobbled it all up too :). (The normal long grain rice cooked well so I dont think the minute rice is necessary as previously mentioned) I didnt have onion soup mix so i just added onion salt and beef boullion to the recipe.. was great!

As is often the case, I made some adjustments.  I was only making half the 
recipe, so just used a can of cream of celery soup.  I didn't add the fresh
mushrooms or the dry onion soup mix.  This made it a little bland, but my 
family liked it very well and it was very easy to put together.  Took a little too 
long to bake, though.  We were starving by the time it was ready.  The rice took
forever to cook.  I think it would be easier to boil the rice ahead and bake the 
casserole for a shorter period.

This recipe was excellent! I used the low fat versions of cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup (I substituted chicken for the celery soup just because of personal preference) and used 1/2 a packet of onion soup and mixed it in with everything else. It was delicious... in fact, I'm bringing the recipe to my next Weight Watchers meeting!

Very easy and good recipe!  I liked it better without the onion soup on top.  I either cut it out completly or mixed it in with the rice cream soup mixture.

I've made this so many times that I try to vary the recipe here and there. I've
added Mozzarella cheese the last 25 min. of baking, used different "Cream of"
soups, added broccoli and tried making it with canned French Onion Soup when I 
was in a pinch.  It's always comes out great. I like to serve it with some French
Baguette Bread and a Green Salad. One of my husband's and kid's favorites!

The first time I made it, it was a bit bland so I changed it up a bit the second time. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery and added celery salt and about 1/4 cup of dry sherry cooking wine, it really spiced it up, I also omitted the onion soup.

This recipe' is great if you want to do something different with your chicken.  The meal was quite tasty and my husband loved it so I will definitely be making this often.  Next time I will try the suggestion of mixing half of the onion soup in with the other soups then putting the rest on top.

For quickness, ease and taste it is very good. I feel, however the dish could be improved by reducing the soup by 1/3 and adding a vegetable such as peas or carrots.

Quick and easy. Good idea to put only half onion soup in and I mixed it in with the soup. I added garlic and celery also.

This was pretty good.  The soup and rice mixed together turned out a bit thicker than I liked, but the chicken turned out really tender and good.  I plan to modify the recipe a bit (more garlic, less soup, a little more water, mixing in the onion soup instead of sprinkling, or mixing half and sprinkling half) when I try it next time. :) I used Healthy Request soups for this recipe and it tasted fine.

This really was a super one dish meal.  I put in fresh mushrooms and celery; next time I'll put only half the amount of onion soup mix, as well (seemed to be  a tad bit on the side of salty).  My kids went bonkers for this, ate it up and asked for seconds!  Bravo!

This is an easy recipe to follow. The mushroom soup and rice combine to make a great dish, especially with the onion soup mix on top.  I highly recommend it.

This didn't taste the same as I remember from a dish like this from years ago.  It was surprising, after using regular condensed soup, that it still needed salt and some other flavor.  I think the recipe that I recalled from the past used sherry, which is fine for me, but I would like to be able to make it without alcohol for some occasions.  Following a notation at the bottom of the recipe, I decided to make it in a crock pot.  This was a mistake, because I wasn't sure how long to cook it, so I overcooked it and the rice was mushy.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, and twice as many mushrooms, as I already had a 7-oz. jar on hand and like mushrooms, and that amount seemed fine.  I'm hoping that I can find my original recipe somewhere, or one online that tastes more like I remember.  I might try this again and bake it in the oven, per the recipe, to see whether that makes a difference.

Husband loved it! I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery, and mixed in the onion soup mix as others suggested.  I also used 1 tsp of garlic powder since we love garlic. Cannot wait to make it again!

This recipe is a family favorite that's fast and easy. Just allow plenty of time for baking. I made a variation using pork chops that I'd like to share. Follow this recipe exactly.  In place of chicken, use pork chops. I prefer boneless loin chops. No need to brown them. Season the chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.  In place of white rice, use instant brown rice, such as minute rice. Continue to sprinkle the dry onion soup mixture on top and follow the rest of the recipe instructions.  We love this!

The flavor was great but it was kind of mushy.  Maybe I used the wrong type of white rice? I will try this again.  I made it exactly as it was written but mine had an offputting texture.

I looked at some of the suggestions and modified the recipe by adding frozen corn and peas and then mixing just a little of the package of onion soup mix in. I used 1/2 C of cooking wine and 1/2 C of water and I also made a topping of crushed cheese/garlic croutons mixed with dried basil and the rest of the onion soup mix. My family loved it and I will definitely make it again. I would have given it 5 stars except for the changes I made.

Great rainy day meal that I made in my Motorhome with a convection oven. I added chopped, cooked bacon to the recipe (sprinkled over soup mix in baking dish) and dehydrated onions to the soup mix up. Turned out wonderful!

I used just over a lb of chicken breast strips versus breasts and cut then up into small pieces and laid those on top .  I also added some chopped fresh asparagus  to add in a vegetable.
Overall cook time was 1 hour.

This is such a simple recipe and tastes great.  I would just add a few more spices next time I make it.  I only used four chicken breasts as my husband bought the chicken and he likes them big and thick and it filled up the 9 x 13 plan.  The rice was cooked.  I did add some peas to the soup mixture.  I will be making this for company and serve with a salad and bread.

I had lost my recipe for this dish that I had years ago and was so happy to find this one.  The only thing I did different is I used chicken thighs because I always have for flavor.  It's awesome.
Thank you for posting it .

Added an additional cup of rice.  Used a 'family size' can of cream of chicken soup...added 1/2 cup more water and 1 cup of milk.  No onion soup mix or canned mushrooms...rather sauted onions, mushrooms, and garlic which were added to the mix.  Used big pieces of chicken breasts.  Whole family enjoyed it.

The first time I made this according to the recipe.  The second time I substituted green chilis for the mushrooms.  Family devoured it both times.  I love that this dish is so simple and versatile!

Delicious and very filling. I followed a couple of suggestions from other reviewers, such as adding a tsp of mustard and cayenne pepper (a tsp might be too much for some, depending on your spice tolerance) and adding some frozen veggies.  I will definitely make this again, but with less chicken.  Next time I'm going to cut up the chicken and mix it into the other ingredients before baking.

Lovely Hubby really liked this dish, I wasn't too excited. I find it way too salty and I really would leave out the dry onion soup mix. 4 stars because it is a quick and okay tasting week night dinner.

Love this recipe my mom used to make one almost like it.  Only she used 2 cans cream of mushroom and mixed the onion soup mix in with the rice mixture.  Also I cover with foil and cook on 350 for 1 he not 2.  Turns out perfect every time.

I mixed it all together because I was in a hurry and not reading. I chopped up a stalk of celery that wouldn't fit in my lunch and threw it all into a crockpot on low and scurried off to work. Also I used some random rice mixture. The rice for me not following instructions was like stuffing, if that makes sense. It was so wonderful to come home to this.

My mother made something similar to this only without the onion soup mix. I didn't have dry onion soup mix on hand but I had condensed onion soup in the can.  I used that and stirred it right in with the rice and then didn't put much water.  I used the soup as the liquid for the rice.  Was very good. Oh, I also used 2 to 1 ratio for the liquid to rice.  1 cup rice used 2 cups liquid.  It turned out fine. I'd give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipie as printed and so 4 start will have to do. I'm sure if you followed the recipie as directed it would also be very good.

This came out awesome! I only used 2 chicken breast (receipe called for 8) and added a cube of chicken flavored bouillon that I dissolved in the cup of water.  I added Lipton Onion Mushroom mix because that is all I had and skip the mushrooms. It came out awesome!

This was good.  I had to sub Golden Mushroom soup for the Cream of Mushroom but it was quite tasty, though a bit salty.  I will make again, but will use only half the onion soup mix to try to cut back on the salt.

This is alot like my sister-in-law's recipe that I have made for years.  Hers calls for a third can of soup, milk instead of water, and doesn't have the onion soup on top.  It comes out a little saucier.  I'll make this one again though, because I think it is a little healthier.

I have been making this for years...it is literally the quickest meal I make.  5 minutes of prep and throw it in the oven.  The only changes I make are to omit the sliced mushrooms and garlic powder...and I generally use bone-in chicken (the end result is not as dry given the long cooking time).

My mother used to make this dish and I loved it!!!  When I found this recipe on the internet I was very excited about makeing it and I did!!!  I choose 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe was missing flavor.  So with that being said, I will play around with this recipe the next time and probably add veggies or something.

I made this for my son and tweaked it with more seasoning. I left out the onion soup mix, far to much salt. I also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. They chicken was moist and tender.

I remember this from childhood. I just couldn't remember how much liquid to add. My receipe is a little different. I use less milk, instant rice and 1/2 cup of red wine. It turns out great!!!!

The rice around the edges gets a little crisp. May need more liquid. I also used fresh mushrooms I had sauteed in butter. Overall, a popular dish in my household.

This is a good building block recipe. I would not make this again as is. It is bland, and I even used an entire packet of onion soup mix, paprika, some chipotle powder. I would make it again with a Mexican variation: add diced green chiles, season the chicken with taco seasoning, cover with shredded cheese and serve with a dollop of sour cream. Maybe even mix salsa in with the rice. Easy to make though -- customize it to your tastes and preferences and you won't be disappointed.

This is an awesome recipe. I had been looking for a good chicken and rice recipe. I did not add the can of mushrooms or the fresh garlic. I did add garlic powder. Also, I added in a can of cream of chicken and subsituted chicken broth for the water. It turned out great. Thanks alot for a simple recipe.

This was really simple and great for a busy day.  I made this about every other week when my son was first born because it's so easy!

We did not care for this.  The rice/soup mixture was way too salty for our liking.  The chicken; however, was very moist and had a wonderful flavor.  We're saving the chicken for leftovers but ditched the rice/soup mixture.  I believe it was the Onion soup mix that overpowered it.  Perhaps, if this was omitted, it wouldn't be so salty.  Might try that.  We'll see.  Carol, thanks for the recipe anyway. We always like trying new things and sometimes we find some we like and other times we don't.  If we all had the same tastes then there wouldn't be anything new to try.

This is a great recipe for a "busy day."  I add a can of water chestnuts for some crunch.

I followed this recipe to the "T", and it did not work well.  I don't know what I could've done wrong?  The rice did not cook evenly, so after 1 hour and 15 min. of cooking time, I had to remove the chicken, and stir the rice/soup mixture because it was dry and sticky on the outside, but still soupy and hard in the middle.  After cooking it 15 more minutes, it seemed to be at least presentable.  My rule of thumb - if you ever have to alter recipes to make them "work" or presentable, throw the recipe out.  On top of it all, it just didn't taste that great.  Pretty bland actually.

My husband is a very picky eater and when I saw this recipe I thought it would be simple and something we would both enjoy. We think the onion taste was overbearing, but the rice was really great since it was not all in the rice. I will try it one more time either with not the entire package of onion soup or completely skip it.

When I checked this the first time in the oven, I was considering ordering a pizza...the smell was horrible but not  wanting to waste the  food I went ahead with the rest of the cooking..by the time it was done, it was great and the strange smell went away!

I loved this recipe.  It came out really good.  The only change I made was that I put 2 cups of rice but other then that I kept the same recipe.  The chicken came out really good and I had never made rice in the oven.  I surprised how good it came out.  I will cook this again.

I doubled the soup and rice and water (I used chicken broth instead) in the recipe to stretch it into a second meal and had some problems with the rice being crunchy.  Not sure if it was my quantity changes or the recipe itself. Over all it was tasty but not out of this world.

This turned out pretty good. I browned the chicken on both sides and seasoned it first, as well as sauteed some onions. The only real change i made was putting 2 cream mushroom instead of 1 cream celery b/c i didn't have it. I think seasoning the chicken well and browning it first makes it taste less bland.

I thought this concotion tasted just awful.  It tasted like it came from a can.

I guess I just do not like casseroles like this and do not like "cheating" by using canned soups and powdered mixes.

I used to add the onion soup to the rice mix but this is a great twist, adding it on top of the chicken adds so much flavor and gives the chicken a nice color.

I made two changes to this recipe.  Instead of cream of celery I used cream of chicken since that's what I had.  I also didn't have the dried soup so I used some breadcrumbs.  I thought it turned out okay, if not very flavorful (probably the dried soup gives it more flavor).  My boyfriend liked it though so I'll try it again and mix in some more veggies and try the dried soup for flavor.

I should have known better.  Every time I try a recipe like this the rice comes out woefully underdone.  I have tried placing the chicken on top of the rice and soup mixture, so this time I tried pouring the mixture over the chicken.  No help. The rice was practically gritty.  I read through the reviews and this doesn't seem to be a common problem, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. And to top it off the chicken was dry.  I'm glad I only made half the recipe.

This was okay.  If you're not into spices or bold flavor this would be a good recipe for you. It's what it says it is-chicken and rice. It was just too bland for me.

My husband, who doesn't cook, made this for me on an extra busy day.  He decided he is an excellent chef!  It's delicious.

Easy, Fast, Tasty.  This is ready in minutes!  Everyone really enjoyed but the onion is quite strong, so make sure you flip the chicken and mix in with the rice and sauce just after cooking and before serving.

Great recipe!!! Family ate it up. Make sure all the rice and soup mix is wet by sprinkling a little more water on top with your fingertips before cooking.

This was very good and my husband loved it and said we had found another keeper. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. 

I bought 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into smaller pieces. 

Next time, I might substitute the cream of celery for cream of broccoli and cheese.

this was fairly tasty. i used cream of mushroom and chicken. since the celery soup is kind of gross. but 1 1/2 hours was not long enough. the rice was still very crunchy. so i had to cook it another 30 minutes to get it done. and i dont understand why you did not just mix the onion soup in with everything else. i stirred it all together when it was done anyway. most likely will make it again. i really liked the rice.

Rating this for the kind of recipe it is--quick and easy family fare--it very cleary gets five stars.  This can be thrown together in five minutes, assuming you have the chicken already thawed ... it could not be easier.  This might become an old standby at my house.

Just not that good. We ate it but vowed never to make again. I added diced onion as well. The rice wasn't cooked all the way in some spots even though it baked for a lot longer than the recipe called for.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup,
so used,cream of chicken and cream of
celery, and used about 1/2 of the onion soup mix.  I'm glad that I did because it would have been way too salty for our taste with the whole pkg.  It took about longer than the time specified, but the rice did get done and it was pretty tasty.

Well...rice was REALLY mushy and the chicken was still not cooked after 2 hours.  And, the onion soup mix on the top?  OMG - was it STRONG....we all scraped it off because it made the chicken inedible.  I had even mixed the soup mix with 1/4 parmesan cheese before I sprinkled it on the chicken to cut the strong flavor.  I've been looking for a good chicken and rice recipe....I guess I'll keep looking, because this one isn't it for us.

This was delicious, very good comfort food.  I took the advice and used 2 boxes of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice and doubled the water.  I am on a low-sodium diet, so I omitted the dry soup mix.  It was just wonderful, definately a keeper.

Here is how I fix this and with the changes I love it even better: I used a box of Uncle Bens Wild Rice with seasoning packet instead of the white rice and seasonings, I delete the mushrooms. This is super easy and tastes great! I have also added broccoli on occasion for a meal in one.

The chicken breasts made the center of the dish watery and the edges of the rice got hard before the middle got done.  Think I'll just make the rice without the chicken as that did have a good flavor.

The chicken was great but I found the rice mushy and clumpy, we had no sauce left to speak of. Flavour was not bad, but rice left much to be desired.

This sounded so good because we love everything in it. But it turned out sooo bad. After 1 1/2 hours, my rice still wasn't done, so I stirred it and cooked for another 30 minutes. After that, the rice was done, but it was just a gummy, sticky, gooey mush. My family hated it. I will not make this again.

I thought this recipe was delicious, although I revised it a bit. Used chicken seasoning instead of the onion soup, and used wild rice instead of the white. I also made more rice on the side to mix with the sauce.

I used 2 cups of leftover rice, added 3 c of frozen green beans and used 1/2 the onion soup in the cream soup mix and used the remainder for topping on the chicken.  This is going into our 'family favorites', easy, quick, tasty!

Very good! Very easy! Kids probably won't care for the mushrooms.

This was a great recipie. I also used the low fat soups, used brown rice and added a can of corn. My six year old who is very picky loved it.

A little bit too salty.  Next time won't put the onion soup mix on top--mayabe chopped onions instead.  The soup made the texture mushy as well as making the casarole too salty.  My husband loved it though.

Added more water, decreased the amount of soup by half and mixed in the dry onion soup mix with the liquid ingredients.  It was very good.

I like this recipe, though I like it better with cream of chicken soup instead of celery.  I also like to use paprika in it.
