Used this as a base recipe and really enjoyed it.  I was asked to make 20 servings of baked beans for a child's party.  I used 2 (55 oz each) cans and 1 (28 oz) can of Bush's Original baked beans, 4 packages of Oscar Meyer bacon crumbles (the ones in the bag near the croutons, salad dressing, etc.), 1 large onion (minced fine), 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (which was plenty), 3 1/2 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 1/2 Tbsp of mustard, 1 3/4 Tbsp of Worcestershire and added 1 1/2 - 2 tsps. of Liquid Smoke along with 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of black pepper.  Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 4 1/2 hours then switched to warm to keep them hot for the party.  Everyone loved them.  I will definitely make these again for family gatherings!

Excellent baked beans.  I made bbq ribs, mashed potatoes and these beans.  The beans were everyone's favorite.  I didn't measure anything, but otherwise didn't make any changes to the recipe

7/2/15 update: I have been making this for parties on Memorial Day, 4th of July, etc. for several years now.  I love the recipe as-is, but have found that adding some cooked ground beef adds an excellent twist.  I discovered this one year when I had too many burger patties.  I just grilled a couple of the extras and through it in the beans with the bacon.  Very tasty!

DELICIOUS recipe. I double the recipe to make it a main dish and it was a hit. There was only 1/4 of the casserole left over. I added more ketchup & mustard to make it more moist. I used hamburger instead of bacon. I didn't get to use Worcestershire sauce, because I did not have any. That didn't matter to the family. I topped it off w/ cornbread batter on top of the casserole the last 15 minutes and baked some more until cornbread was done. I wanted to use Pillsbury Biscuits, but didn't have any :-) Great recipe and thanks for sharing. It was nice having something new at the table.

I give this 5 starts b/c it's delicious! Even when I accidentally put 1 tablespoon of mustard in instead of teaspoon and no bacon b/c I didn't have any.  It is very, very tasty!  I say try it, next time I will add the bacon.

I thought these tasted pretty good, but very sweet.  I even used two cans of baked beans and didn't double the sugar and they were still too sweet.  I used store brand baked beans and I do not recommend doing that as they were very runny right from the beginning, which made for runny finished beans.  I think I would use this recipe as a base next time to make baked beans to suit my personal taste

This was great!  Tasted yummy and pretty easy to make even for me.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It did seem like a lot of work for what you can buy in the store, but I think it tasted a bit better than the store.  Oh and I used turkey bacon.  Just as good.

I followed the tips from some of the reviews and instead of the bacon (didn't have any) I cut up a leftover bbq'd hamburger patty and threw that in, and topped it off with quartered pillsbury biscuits for the last 15 mins (turned the heat down to 375 for that).  Awesome recipe and a great base for all sorts of add ins to be thrown in.  Thank you!

I tasted the bean mixture after adding the 1/4 cup brown sugar, and it was already very, very sweet.  I looked at the label on the can, and brown sugar is listed as the fourth ingredient, so my gut was telling me that another 3/4 cup brown sugar on top of the casserole would ruin this.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup sprinkled on top of the bacon, and these beans still are really sweet (probably will cut back to 1/8 cup mixed into the bean mixture in the future).  I took out of the oven at 30 min because they were cooked perfectly for us.  We like them cold as well as hot, so a consistency just a little runny makes great leftovers for the next day.  All in all, not a bad recipe and not a lot of work either.

WOW I made these for a bday party where we were having pulled pork and people were all wondering what I did to the beans that made them so good.. some people had 4 helpings... and my father in law keeps asking my mother in law to ask what I did with the beans so she can do it everytime she makes beans! Definitely a keeper!

Very good, but too sweet. Next time will leave the brown sugar out of the beans and just sprinkle on top of the beans and crumbled bacon. Other than that its a really good recipe with nice subtle flavors. Nothing is overpowering, but all blend well for a sweet savory smokey flavor. Comfort food!

Oh man! This recipe TOTALLY lives up to its name. My family was over the moon for these beans. My only thought is double the recipe. We are a family of three and we were fighting over the remainders...not nearly enough to go around. Yummmmmmmy!

This is one of my favorite things to eat when we grill.  I usually use a little bit more bacon than the recipe calls for.  I have even made it with ground sausage and it was fantastic.  Believe me, everyone will rave about these beans.

I doubled this recipe for a birthday dinner for mybf that we had this weekend, but when I thought of adding 2 cups sugar, I chickened and only added just under 1 and 3/4 cups. It was delish. So delish that everyone begged for leftovers and we had none at the house left! My crazy bf didn't realize it was a recipe and thought it was regular beans straight from the can... lol and now all is gone... his loss. Yummy yummy yummy... thank you so much for posting!!!!

I didn't have brown sugar, so I used 1/4 cup white sugar in the beans with a sprinkling of white sugar on top.  It was delicious.

Very good baked beans.  The only change I made was to only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar, rather than 1 cup.  Served this with 'Easy Slow Cooker Pulled Pork' from AR.  Thanks NomNom for sharing your recipe.

I modified this recipe quite a bit. It served about 13 people as a side dish. It came out fabulous. My boyfriend who does not like baked beans and never has, LOVED them. He put them in a solo cup and poured them into his mouth because he liked them so much haha! I also used B&M original beans.


•	2 tablespoon butter
•	1 yellow onion, finely diced
•	1 pound bacon
•	2 (28 ounce) can baked beans 
•	4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
•	2 tablespoon ketchup
•	2 teaspoon prepared deli mustard
•	2/3 cup brown sugar, divided

Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2.	Cook bacon in a skillet or bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Allow to cool and chop into pieces about the size of a dime. 
3.	Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until soft.
4.	Add 2 cans of beans to the skillet and stir until hot.
5.	Add Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and mustard. Stir until evenly blended.
6.	Measure out 2/3 cup of brown sugar, packed. Break apart with a fork before adding to the skillet. Once broken up, add to the skillet and stir until the brown sugar is completely melted. 
7.	Pour into a baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.

I took this to a bbq on July 4th and it was a hit.  I had about 8 different people say they were the best baked beans and what did I do.  I let them know about this recipe, it's perfect as written.

These are fantastic!   I cooked the onions in some butter for just a couple minutes.  Added maybe only 1/4 cup brown sugar.  And used pre cooked bacon.  Yummy!

I doubled the batch.  I put it in my crock pot for Christmas day, then baked at the end without the extra brown sugar (since I read it can be too sweet).  It was awesome with ham, and with all the left overs days later!

Excellent! I drained the baked beans first and then I only used 1/4 c brown sugar in the beans and left the rest of the sugar out of the recipe. It was perfect!

So based on many reviews I doubled the recipe and as I don't care for too sweet stuff I elected to go with 1/4 brown sugar total even when I doubled the ingredients and I think this turned out perfect.  Many compliments at dinner table too.  I put it all in a slow cooker for 4 hours on low and will definitely make again.

Delicious! Followed the recipe, but didn't add the bacon. Bush's Baked beans are already pretty good as is, but this recipe made it taste even better! Will definitely be referring back to this recipe from now on!

This was too sweet for my taste. A cup of brown sugar in this recipe is at least 1/2 cup too much. I am going to keep looking for another recipe or modify this one next time.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

I have made this recipe several times for a crowd and it is a hit.  I double the recipe but do not double the amount of bacon or brown sugar.  By making these adjustments, it is just right for my taste.  I would give it five stars if less bacon and brown sugar were called for in the original recipe.

These baked beans were great. I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and that was perfect for us. Served them at a summer cookout party along with grilled hot dogs, potato salad, and watermelon, and it was the perfect side to go along with what we were having. There wasn't a single bean left after our party. I would definitely make these again and would probably double the recipe because they were popular.

Simple and easy, I added a bit of cinnimon to finish it off.  Saving the remaining brown sugar and bacon to sprinkle on top made a great presentation.

Really really good.  I cut the brown sugar in half based on other reviewers suggestions. I also added 1 jalapeño, seeded and diced.  Great flavor and a big hit!

Loved it! Used Dijon mustard instead of plain yellow mustard, only because I didn't have any, and it adds a little extra something. Will definitely be making this again.

This had a nice flavour but felt a little dry to eat. Typical of baked beans though. I used less sugar as I didn't like the idea of it being very sweet. It was rich also, I would only have a small serve as a side dish. Thanks for the recipe.

Best beans. I've made these a few times now. I made a few changes. I don't add onion or the worcestershire sauce. I add an extra can of Bush's Beans usually 14oz or so, I also double up on the ketchup and mustard. I've been asked to always bring the beans to family functions now.

Added 2 T maple syrup, followed all other direction - very good. Was in rush 2nd time to make, so I cooked on stove top, medium heat, using automatic stir things from drugstore - awesome and fast. Just take off once sugars thicken. This is a keeper
