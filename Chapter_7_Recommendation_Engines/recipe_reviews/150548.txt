I was looking for recipes to use my pomegranates and found this.  This is absolutly the best dressing.  However, I did leave out the cinnamon. We had it with a spinach salad with feta, walnuts and red onions.  To die for!  My husband said it was the best salad he's ever had.  I keep running to the store to get more salad things.  Will try adding the fennel next time.  Not quite sure about the tangerines.  Did sprinkle with the arils though.  Beautiful!  Thanks so much for posting!

This recipe is phenominal!  

The salad is stunningly beautiful and tastes wonderful.  This is perfect for entertaining and is really quite simple.

The dressing is delicious and would be great on other salads as well.

If you want to impress dinner party guests, this is THE salad to present.  I went with just a pinch more ground black pepper but did not need to change anything else.  The flavors are amazing, balanced and complex.  With such a beautiful array of colors, this salad looks elegant no matter how you choose to plate it.  Absolutely a 5 star recipe.

This salad was WONDERFUL.  Even my friends who aren't real big salad lovers liked this.
