I made this last night for hot dogs. In the south we eat homemade slaw, homemade chili, diced sweet onions and mustard on our dogs. This was perfect for a southern hot dog! I used beef broth instead of water. Since I was using 80/20 beef I just cooked my beef and mashed it, drained it, and added it back to pan. Then added the beef broth as needed. I used Rotel's tomato sauce with diced green chiles (try it if you can still find it). I used a small 8 oz can of the tomato/chile sauce for 1.5 lbs of beef. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. Absolutely yummy! My husband who doesn't eat chili with beans commented that he could eat this chili with just a spoon. BIG statement coming from him! Thanks so much for sharing this one! It's a keeper!!

I made this recipe twice--once following the recipe exactly and again with some changes.  As written, the recipe is pretty good but is missing 'something' and is a little runny, as other reviewers found (hence the 3 stars).  I made it a second time and this time used beef broth instead of water (and omitted adding the extra salt), added 1 clove of garlic, and used tomato paste instead of sauce (made it less runny), and added 1/2 a tsp of brown sugar.  I also reduced the amount of chili powder (to 1/2 tsp) to make it more child-friendly, and my toddler and husband both loved it!

This was really good, the whole family really liked it.  I would have given it 5 stars but it was a little too greasy for my taste. I think next time I will cook the meat first and then add to the sauce. I had no problem with it getting thick, but I also just realized I didn't add the water. oops! :o)  Thanks so much for sharing the goodness!

Made this chili last night for dinner over hotdogs,and it's a keeper.  I followed the recipe TO THE LETTER.  It looks a little unappetizing while it simmers, but I allowed it to simmer over a low heat for about an hour and it was worth the wait. Turned out to be a perfect chili dog dinner.  I used oscar meyer classic weiners and Martin's potato roll hotdog buns, with a smear of mayo on the bun, a drizzle of mustard and minced onions on the top.  The way I like my chili dogs. For those who aren't fond of semi sweet chili, you could always eliminate the tiny bit of sugar but I never, ever, review these website recipes unless I follow the complete directions exactly.  I like this one and made a recipe card for it.

I am wiping a tear from my eye, Jeff!!!   This is awesome!  As a child, I practically lived on 'chili buns' (just chili in a hot dog bun) from a drive-in restaurant in my hometown in North Carolina.  After I moved away as an adult, I have missed that chili so much.  I can't tell you how many restaurants and recipes I have tried with great hope, only to be disappointed.  But today I tried your chili, and it takes me back to all those chili buns I had as a child.  Thanks for sharing!!

Perfect!  I made this recipe exactly as is except I did not have any onion powder - so I left that out.  I have been trying to get a good hot dog chili recipe for years and everyone tells me the ingredients they use but that they do not measure the ingredients so they dont know how much to tell me to add - so I would try over and over and just couldnt get it right!  This was perfect!

This is the closest thing to the southern chili for hot dogs I've had in a long time.  LOVED IT..however, next time I think I will try not adding the sugar, it was sweeter than I thought it would be and the chili I grew up eating wasn't sweet at all. Ketchup has sugar in it as well, which will probably be enough sweet for us. I did substitute beef broth for the water. Used 93/7 ground beef and took the advice of others, browned the meat and then drained the fat. Even so I followed the recipe exactly other than the method and the beef broth. Now I have a great chili for our hot dogs and it's pretty healthy.  The whole family really likes it.  Thanks orion3 for sharing.

I know everyone hates it when you change recipes, but hey - I'm not a pro and I can't customize it so don't read on if you're annoyed by my notes.  Watching fat, so I opted to combine the meat & water first - merrily mashing and squishing along so I could achieve that hotdog sauce consistency.  Then I drained meat and skimmed the fat from the liquid.  Was worried about the sweetness of our ketchup, so I only added half of what was called for and stopped after that (would have been way too sweet).  Entirely skipped the sugar, but added everything else recipe called for.  Added back some of the reserved liquid and let it reduce.  Finally opted to add a few shakes of Hungarian Hot Paprika for just that little bit of kick.  Outstanding and a new hotdog sauce fav!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Awesome quick hot dog chili.  Great in a pinch.  Browned and drained the beef first.  Used whole can of tomato sauce w/green chili, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, and 2/3 C water, and boiled down to thick sauce consistency.   Also added garlic powder and a pinch of oregano.  Tastes better than canned!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I had 3 leftover grilled hamburgers and chopped them up in my food processor.  The result was finely chopped meat (which I like) and the chili had that little extra something from the taste of the grill!

I made this two months back for a baseball-themed pot luck for chili dogs and nachos and I think folks licked the bowl when it was gone.  Literally nothing was left in the Crock Pot.  I scaled the recipe to 5 lbs of meat and could have used two more!  I did add a bit of cumin, some celery seed, and used about 1/2 ketchup with 1/2 tomato sauce just to avoid some of the sweetness, but otherwise as written.  

Just for a trial, I made another batch this week and added beans for eating out of a bowl.  That was pretty tasty, as well.  Especially the next day. 

Thanks, Jeff, for a great recipe we will use many times over.

We really enjoyed this!  Added about a tsp of garlic powder, upped black pepper to full tsp, chili powder to full Tbsp, used about a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  Subbed low-sugar ketchup and Splenda for the ketchup and sugar.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup of sauteed onions.

I just made this recipe, the only things I did different was to cook it on low versus medium.  When I was done I let it sit in the pot with the cover on for about 15 minutes before I was going to eat it then I tipped the pan and drained off the fat that rose to the top with a spoon.  I loved this chili sauce.  I like it a little less greasy, hence why I drained off some of it off the top.  It will definately be my go to chili for hot dogs this summer!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe. I make it a lot but wanted to say I have been substituting the water with a 1/2 cup of beef broth. One of my wife's favorites.

This was so good.  Like some other reviewers, I substituted beef broth for the water.  I also used a can of rotel diced tomatoes and a full teaspoon of pepper.  This was so good.  Grilled some Nathan's Famous hot dogs to serve it one.

My husband requested chili dogs for dinner last night so, I figured I'd look for a simple chili recipe rather than buy canned.  This one hit the spot!  It was perfect!  I made mine exactly to the recipe and it was not too runny or too greasy at all.  Keep in mind, the amount of grease you have is most likely going to depend on the fat content of your ground beef.  I bought mine on the lean side.  Mashing the ground beef is a genius idea!  This is not the hearty type of chili that you'd want to eat over rice with garlic bread, but more of a condiment chili IMO so I didn't feel the need to add anything extra!  Will definitely be making this again, next time for chili cheese fries:)

Made it according to directions, tasted like Manwich made with too much meat and some extra water to make it stretch.

This recipe was very tasty. However, it seemed to me to be more like Sloppy Joes than Hot Dog Chili. Hence, only 3 stars.

Husband said it tasted like Dairy Queen's chili.  I thought it was too salty.  Tasted it as I was making it and I went back to the recipe thinking I must have missed an ingredient or something, but I didn't. I wanted to be WOWED by this, but I just wasn't.

I love this recipe for both chili dogs and I change it up a little for a big pot of chili on a cold night.  I double the recipe and add chopped onion, kidney beans, and cayenne pepper.  Perfect with cheese and crackers.

This is a very good recipe. For those saying its too runny, it just needs to cook down a little, so I simmered it for 30 extra minutes. The family loved it.

I just fixed this tonight for dinner. My husband and I had been craving good, old-fashioned chili dogs for a week now, so I had to try this recipe. I followed it to the letter except for mashing the beef--no time for that. The sauce was delicious and was way better than the stuff from the can. Kudos to Jeff for this delicious version of the classic chili dog sauce!

This  homemade hot dog chili is the best! It is very easy to put  a little heat to it  if you choose to do so. I used minced onions in place of onion powder. We love it!

I wanted a good hot dog recipe & this was at top of the list. I read all the reviews & tweaked it a little based on what was said. I doubled the recipe & used ground turkey & the old-fashioned potato masher is perfect for breaking the meat up! I used an 8-oz can tom sauce, at first only used 1/2 cup ketchup since some people said it was too sweet, but it tasted like it was missing something so I went ahead & put the other 1/2 cup in (since I doubled it). I left the sugar out, added an extra tsp of chili powder, and minced about 1/4 of a large onion since I didn't have onion powder. The consistency & texture was just perfect after it simmered 20 min. Is very good recipe & I'm going to add some pictures I took! Definitely would use this recipe again-thanks Jeff!:)

Oh Jeff, thank you for sharing! Of course, I thought I would have some left over from this batch to maybe use the next day, or to freeze for next weekend, but NO!!!! My one son kept going past the pan, taking a taste every single time! I just didn't bother measuring the chili powder, since my family is a bunch of "hotheads", but I will tell you, I'll be making this many, many times in the future!

Absolutely perfect. I used stevia instead of sugar because my family has issues with blood sugar but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very tasty. I will make it again.

This is my go to hot dog chili recipe! I have made it as is and I have changed it based on what is in my pantry, it can be adapted many different ways and really just depends on what you prefer! Reading the reviews always helps with the adaptations. My current version is with beef broth instead of water, real onions instead of powder, ketchup & paste instead of tomato sauce & no sugar.

I followed another user's suggestion and changed out the water for beef broth and the tomato sauce for tomato paste.  I made it for the first time and won 2nd place in a Sunday School chili cookoff!!  This is great by itself and wonderful on top of potatoes, nachos, etc.

I made this but like others I cooked the meat and drained it first.
I also replaced water with beef broth.
I had a small portion of taco meat as well as some left over BBQ/sloppy joe meat that I added after Browning the burger.
I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce, and did not add any extra salt, nor  sugar.
I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin as well.
Simmered for about an HR. 
It thickened up very nice. 
This is a great recipe and one can tweak it to their own liking.

Made this tonight. I used beef broth versus water. This was a bit sweet, even without the sugar. It is comparable to Sloppy Joe filling. I added extra chili powder, red pepper flakes, black beans and some onion after trying the recipe as written.  Good but not great.

I made this recipe for a party to top hot dogs.  I browned the beef, drained well then combined all ingredients into the crock pot.  I cooked on high for 2 hours.   It was a huge hit!! So delicious !

It was super easy and quick.  However; it was too sweet for my liking.   I will definitely leave out the sugar and maybe cut back on either the tomato sauce or ketchup.

This was very good on a hot dog, though the ketchup made it seem more like sloppy joe meat than chili. It wasn't really spicy, so the chili powder could be increased if you want more of a kick. I did make 2 modifications. First, I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste instead of sauce because that's what I had. I also browned the meat first, then drained it while adding the other ingredients to the pot. It was too thick at first, but I added some of the drained fat a spoonful at a time until the texture was right.

We really enjoyed this! The only thing I did differently was at the end, it was still a bit runny, so I thickened w/ some Wondra and that worked great. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I just made this ,I expanded the recipe to 60 serving and invested in 10# of ground beef and I have to say im not impressed ,I was hesitant to add the sugar and to use that much Worcestershire sauce what I have now is 5 gallons of sweet tasting chili .I made this for a church function tomorrow and I am going to have to do something to it to make it palatable DONT PUT SUGAR IN IT ! I'm from Texas and we know what chili is supposed to taste like

It was a decent base to start with but I definitely had to add a lot more spices and seasonings to get more of that chili dog flavor. Didn’t need all the sugar either. Perhaps if I had not added the full half teaspoon I would not of had to add extra of everything else. I also did a combo of tomato sauce and tomato paste to thicken it up slightly. I used a bit of mustard and some Sriracha as well to give it a little more heat.  It was definitely a sweet yet somewhat bland chili without all of my extras added to it. I’d use it again as a base but like I said I’d add tons more seasoning to it.

I've made this several times and my family loves it on hot dogs and on hamburgers. I made it exactly as the recipe states and then I made it with a whole petite diced onion. We like it better with the onion but it's amazing as is.

I made this for our 4th of July hotdog cookout and for anytime we are grilling burgers or hotdogs. I used a 10 ounce can of diced tomatoes with green chilies because I had it on hand.  I pulsed the tomatoes, left out the water in the recipe  and changed the white sugar to brown sugar.  I carmalized 1 diced onion, put that in and eat u the onion powder. We like our chili a little thicker in the South.  This was perfect.  Great recipe.  I have had many say this is the best hotdog chili they have ever had.

I  made this recipe to the letter,  aside from a pinch of flour to thicken it up. It was good-but didn't quite say hot dog chili to me. I added 2 more teaspoons of chili powder and it was better, but it still seems like it needs a little more spice or something.

I didn't read the ingredients right and put a whole 8 oz can of tomato sauce and omitted the sugar. Next time I will put the correct amt of T. Sauce, Love the texture.It's a keeper.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now and LOVE IT! Only change I make is also adding 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. Otherwise, this hot dog chili is amazing!

Would have given 5 stars except for the changes made...I was asked to make chili dogs for our youth group and had no idea what kind of chili to make...I did not have onion powder, so I  substituted dried minced onion (1 1/2 teaspoon), I omitted the sugar, added a dash or two of hot sauce and a tablepoon dijion (based on 6 servings.  It was a huge hit!  I am glad I increased the recipe x4 as I ran out of chili before I ran out of dogs.   I did have to skim the fat off the top at least three times during the cooking process and after the intial start on the stove I transferred it to the crockpot to continue to cook and for transport.

This chili did not taste bad, it was just not what I was looking for for hot dogs, hamburgers and chili cheese fries.  It's a bit sweet, and I didn't quite use as much ketchup as called for.  With onions and peppers it would make a really tasty sloppy joes, and I'll use this recipe as a sloppy joe base in the future.  After following the recipe and tasting, I added a touch of vinegar, mustard, cumin and garlic powder to reduce the sweet and add more spicy flavor, which made it more what my family was looking for.

Giving this 4 stars because I did change this a little, but without this recipe to inspire me I wouldn't have made it! I had 1/2 bag of vegetarian crumbles left from something else so I used that and grated about a 1/4 of an onion into it, and warmed that up first, then added the tomato sauce (used regular sized can), 1/2 can of tomato paste (eliminated the ketchup and sugar; we wanted savory, not sweet), double the chili powder and added 1 tsp each cumin and oregano, and about 3/4 tsp of garlic powder as well. Added the rest of the ingredients as listed on the recipe, and at the end I added just a dash of cayenne pepper at the end for just a tiny touch of heat. Did not add water and it was PLENTY thick this way! I ended up eating this over fries with some shredded cheese (chili cheese fries!). Awesome sauce!

It was very close to what I was looking for.  Good job, Jeff.  Made it my own with a 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and 1 tsp of cumin.

THE RECIPE WAS FINE.  A LITTLE SWEET FOR MY TASTE SO I ADDED MY OWN SPICES AND INGREDIENTS TO STEER THE FLAVOR MORE TOWARD SAVORY. 
I CUT BACK ON THE KETCHUP, ELIMINATED THE SUGAR ALTOGETHER AND USED TOMATOE PASTE (WHICH ADDED PLENTY OF SWEET)ALONG WITH BEEF STOCK AND BEER.
ADDED A LITTLE MORE CHILI POWDER(DOUBLE)SOME CUMIN AND OREGANO THEN SIMMERED FOR AN HOUR ON LOW.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT, SAMPLE TEASPOONS HAVE GOOD FLAVOR.
WHAT KIND OF HOT DOGS ARE GOOD, FLAVORFUL AND HEALTY...ANYONE?

I so wanted to love this after reading the reviews, but sadly, it was not what I was expecting. Followed recipe exactly and it tasted like Manwich! Took it to work for a hot dog event, and everyone who tried it agreed it tasted like sloppy joes. Nothing against sloppy joes, but I wanted a hot dog chili and this just is not it!

STICK TO THE RECIPE, at least for the first time. I've made this twice. The first time I listened to the suggestions in the comments and it was ok, the second time I followed the directions and it came out much better.

Browning the beef changed the consistency, it made it much more clumpy and dry so use lean beef and don't brown/drain. I also used beef broth which overwhelmed the other flavors instead of the water which would bring out the flavor of the spices.I ended up with something closer to Taco Bell ground beef both in flavor and consistency. It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.

The second time I followed the directions exactly and it came out much tastier and with a more sloppy consistency.

I had to come change my rating. Initially, I wasn't impressed, but maybe it was too hot to get a good taste. ;-) My teen gives it 4.5 stars; hubby 4; my little one doesn't understand the rating system. Personally, I'd give it a good 4-ish (plus) rating. Thanks, Jeff, for a good recipe! It seems I'll be making this again, after all. :-)

Perfect with some modifications!  Use 85/15 ground beef. Do not brown the beef first, it all cooks together. Use 1 full 8oz can of tomato sauce (the small size can). DO NOT exceed 1/2 tsp of sugar - it goes a long ways in this recipe.

Made this for a cookout and everyone loved it! I even sent some leftover chili home with friends. It reminds me of the chili they served at a Mom & Pop hotdog place where I grew up and that's a great thing. 
The only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of water and to sub some of the ketchup with pizza sauce I had on hand. I overestimated how much ketchup I had and only had about a 1/4 cup.
We served the hot dogs with chili, shredded cheese, minced onion, dill relish, and sauerkraut.

I used tomato paste instead of sauce. I like a “stiff” chili sauce on my hot dogs. I, like another, used beef broth instead of water and only added enough to cook the chili. About a cup. I also added more chili powder. Everyone will need to adjust that to their taste. I made it early, put in the fridge and reheated for dinner. This gives the flavors time to blend. Really good on a dog!

Is this made with one half of a 10 ounce can of tomato sauce, which would be five ounces, or with 10 ounces of tomato sauce?  I wonder about that every time I make this!

Made as directed except cooked & drained the meat. We used it for chili & cheese nachos. My hubby loves them but the canned chili is way too salty so this was perfect. Definitely a keeper.

I made Jeff's Hot Dog Chili for a July 4th family get together.  Everyone really loved it.  I followed the recipe with no changes and will continue to do so.  So much better than chili from a can!  

We had left over chili and my husband used it in tacos in place of the taco meat.  I wasn't very sure about this, but it turned out really good.  Would use this in place of taco seasoned ground beef again!

I have made this over ten times. It is my “go to” hot dog chili recipe.  There is nothing wrong with chili in a can when you are in a hurry.  But I take my hot dogs seriously, and this is up to the match.   The recipe is fine as is.  I like to add some cumin and garlic. The beauty of Jeff’s recipe is that it is so adaptable. Add what you like.  Thank you Jeff!

Yes, I will make it again without change.

Made this as a quick addition to hotdog night.  My mom said it was the best chilli she had ever had.  That’s a very high acclaim to achieve.  It is a sweet chilli but it doesn’t over power like some do.  Will definitely make a gain

Unfortunately I agreed with other reviewers when they said it tastes like sloppy joe sauce. We would eat it again as sloppy joes, but we definitely would not put it on top of our hot dogs.

Big hit today! Made this for my kid’s school’s “Dads and Dogs” father & son cookout today and it was a crowd pleaser! I had a whole toppings bar out with just about everything to fix up your dog and this chili was more popular than the melted cheese sauce! And with kids no less! I was shocked!

Just a heads up for any hotdog chili newbies like me, the texture is going to be very different than traditional chili. I’m used to chunky, bean-y chili and this is more of a sauce with very finely crumbled meat (adding the bit of water while sautéing the beef  does this). It’s perfect for a hotdog where space is a bit limited in the bun. 

Anywho, do yourself a favor and try this out!

First of all, my name is Jeff. I knew right away this had to be good. I was right.  I did make 2 small changes though. I used the whole can of mater sauce 'cause whacha gonna do with the other half ? I skipped the water. I also diced up a jalepeno in it. Quick and easy. Will make it many more times

This was a good Hot Dog Chili. It was my first time making any Hot Dog Chili and I was happy with how it turned out. I rated it 3 stars because it was a little bit sweeter than I would have liked. Next time I make it I will probably omit the 1/2 tsp. of Sugar.

It's good! I added a bit more chili powder, a dash of garlic powder and more Worcestershire. I only had jar pasta sauce in the pantry so I used that instead of plain tomato sauce. I cooked it down more, about a full hour.

I didn't have any onion powder so I used about 1/2 cup of finely diced onion instead. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. However, I still thought it was missing something so I added some garlic powder. Then it was perfect for me. This is a great easy recipe for hot dog chili (we call it "coney sauce" where I'm from). I topped my dogs with mustard, chili, and shredded cheddar. My girlfriend's son is very picky and even he went back for seconds.

We LOVED this! I added a teaspoon of sugar (shhhh, don't tell anyone). I used broth instead of water. I added a can of Ro-Tel to replace some of the tomato sauce. I let it simmer to reduce it. Gonna make it tonight and serve it with spiralized zucchini.

Skipped the sugar, doubled the chile powder, added chile peppers and tobasco, and it was STILL too sweet for my tastes. Good on balance, just not my pallate.

This chili was very good.  My husband loves his chili runny and greasy!!!  It was definitely a hit with him.  I followed the recipe mostly,  but added a clove of garlic and 1/2 tsp of brown sugar like another reviewer did.  I love garlic!! The next time I will make it with tomato paste as I like my chili a little thicker.  I hope it will turn out a little thicker, but not too thick.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We do not eat hotdogs often but when we do I take the time to make chili. This recipe is a staple and my go to. For that chili. It is good. Enough to eat on. It’s own and quick enough for a work night throw together meal.

I made this tonight. I added my own little touch with sautéed bell peppers and chili peppers in a little water, paprika and chili powder. I then added this with all the other ingredients and the meat and minced it to be more like a coney. It taste absolutely fantastic. Couldn’t have done it without Jeff. Thanks for sharing!

Other than adding half a teaspoon of cayenne powder, I followed the recipe exactly. The supermarket I went to only had chicken hot dogs, which I do not normally buy, so I didn't expect much from them. I grilled the hot dogs, and, as I anticipated, they were underwhelming, to say the least. I enjoyed the chili!

I enjoyed this chilli sauce. My spouse and I don't eat a lot of beef so I made this with ground turkey, and we used turkey franks. I used all of the ingredients mentioned above, but I just added each to taste. I just saw that it would've been too runny if I cooked it to the times specified, so I just let it simmer for another few minutes to let some moisture evaporate (I almost never cover sauces for that reason when cooking). Next time that I make this, I will reduce the levels of the liquids.

Still, my spouse said that this sauce was a really good compliment to the turkey franks.

Made this last night. It was easy! But I found it to be a bit on the salty side, so I added about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg  to counter the saltiness. I also subbed brown sugar for the white sugar, and beef broth for the water. This will be my go-to recipe when I make hot dogs.

I made it mostly as is, except I didn’t add the sugar.  (As most reviews said it was too sweet). I’m glad I didn’t. I found it plenty sweet with the ketchup.  Really good recipe. We had chili dogs and fries with this chili sauce on it. Really tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

Really easy recipe.  I followed someone else’s comment and used beef broth instead of water. I thought the recipe was ok, but seemed to be lacking in something, just can’t put my finger on it.

This is a good hot dog chili recipe.   I did not have tomato sauce so used tomato paste and like others I used beef broth instead of water.  Only thing I added was a tsp of  white vinegar and yellow mustard plus a little garlic powder.   Did not add sugar.   It was so so good.    Thank you for sharing.

This is sweet...which I don't care for and not like any hot dog chili I had growing up. Maybe it was the ketchup? I didn't add any sugar like it called for because I don't like sweet savory foods. I will definitely not make this again.

Just made it, Love it! Grew up in WV, and chili dogs were the best! BUT (here goes! ??), I’ve been vegetarian since I was twelve (forty one years now!), so I used Morningstar crumbles over Lightlife hot dogs. Been so long for me, but this tasted like what I remember, so THANKS!!

Super easy, super tasty, didn’t have to run to the store to get a can of chili. Used organic ingredients. This recipe is easily adaptable as well. I added extra chili and onion powder and black pepper to make it a little more spicy. I was in a rush so didn’t add other things, but I think it would be good with beans or cut up onions as well. Saving this one as my go-to.

Turned out great!!! I added a little tomato paste to thicken it up and red pepper flakes for some heat. It was good I'll use this recipe again.

I read the reviews first I combined 1/3 cup tomato sauce and 3 T of tomato paste, it made the perfect consistency, I also didn't have onion powder so I substituted dried toasted onion flakes.

It's okay, but was too sweet for me when I followed the recipe. I added more chili powder, white pepper, and a bit of cumin. Turned out okay after that, but definitely needs more modifications to fit my desired flavor profile.

Simple yet fantastic. The ONLY change I made was I started with about 1-1/2 cups water an beat the snot out of the  ground beef to get it really fine and then reduced the water by simmering.

I made this for a church social so I quadrupled it and put it in a crock pot to keep warm till time to eat.

While I was making this, I felt it was wrong to add the water with the ground beef (I was frying up 4lb after all!) so I skipped that and DRAINED the grease from the beef before adding the water and other ingredients.   This is something the directions skip and I feel it was the way it was supposed to be cooked in the first place.  If someone else got a different (better) result by not draining off all the grease, please let me know.

I also used tomato puree instead of sauce since it was thicker and was the right oz size that the recipe suggested.

The finished result was excellent and would have been gone if there weren't three other crockpots full of their own version there as well.

We've made this a couple of times now and it is delicious.  We did make one minor change (though we've also made it directly as written), substituting some homemade beef bone broth for the water as we'd seen someone else recommend.  Both ways are great, but the beef broth adds some extra nutrients and a little more depth of flavor.
If you're worried about it being runny, just let the moisture simmer out a bit longer. Easy peasy.

I’m rating this recipe mostly so that I know exactly what I did for the next time I make it. And there will 100% be a next time !!  Instead of onion powder I finally diced half of a yellow onion. Added one can of kidney beans. Didn’t add any sugar.  Used chicken stock instead of water. And just added the entire small 8 ounce can of tomato sauce.  I cooked the onions with the beef and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Then added the rest of the ingredients and let simmer. Perfect over chili dogs with pretzel buns or chili fries!!

Very easy to make. It's been a huge hit with extended family. I just triple everything for a larger crowd. I use 85% lean ground beef and that helps it not be so greasy.

Thank you!  This is an awesome recipe.  I followed the recipe as written with a few of the most critical help suggestions.  I lowered the amount of chili powder and added a bit of tomato paste to thicken the chili up.  This was a big hit.  So much so that one of my guests that was over for our "Cdn" CFL Grey Cup Party had 5 bowls....he loved it :)  ....always going to use now.  BTW I made two batches of this recipe, so one w/o beans and one w beans ...both were great.

Made as directed for first go. A really nice hot dog chili. Texture is great, got a nice back-end heat. A little sweet for my taste. Will make again, omitting the added sugar and probably using fresh onion.

Followed the recipe exactly, it was too “ketchupy”. So I added some cumin and garlic powder. Much better. Hubby and kids loved it. Super easy.

this is a good recipe and I will make it however I found it to be a bit sweet. Next time I plan to reduce the amount of ketchup and sugar by half add more tomato sauce. The texture and consistency were good. I doubled the dry spices and added some paprika and garlic powder.

This was perfect!  I made this on the 4th of July as I was searching for an easy Coney Sauce. I must confess that I added a dash of cinnamon as this is my thing and that made it off the chart incredible in my opinion.  This will be my standard hot dog sauce moving forward and over spaghetti as well. GREAT JOB JEFF!

It was alright I guess. It was quick and easy but was way too greasy. I followed the recipe to a t and got bad results. It was far too sweet. I made it a second time and revised it a bit. Taking out the sugar and replacing a bit of the ketchup with tomato paste. This made it much more rich and helped with the greasiness.

I don't know Jeff, but I tried his chilli dog recipe. On the first bite I realized he got it right! My memories flashed to when I was  seven years old and when I had the best chilli dog of me life. He got it right. Until now, 60 years later, I had never had that taste again - I have tried many, many times. But, now, my childhood tastes are back. Thank you Jeff for you diligence in getting it right. Try it my friends!

I have been searching for a really good hot dog chili for several years. This one more than fills that bill.

Oh, yeah! Love this! Just like I remember! I ended up not using the extra salt and instead used a bit of celery salt to add just another layer. This is excellent dog chili!!! Made a double-batch just now for a weekend cookout!

Was a wonderful base.  For us, it's not hot dog chili without a little cumin, so I added a tsp of ground cumin after tasting it. I want to say this sauce is really good without it also, but, we like the flavor of cumin in ours.  I also did not add the catsup, but, added some yellow mustard instead and a tablespoon of tomato paste instead. Otherwise, it's a thumbs up for us!

It may just be me, I was really excited for this via the reviews, but I followed the recipe and it tastes like ketchup meat. I tried adding more chili powder and had to resort to grilling onions and mixing it in to get any flavor besides ketchup/tomato. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just didn't work for me.

I made this last night for a little impromptu cookout.  Made it according to the recipe. It was super easy to make, had a good consistency, and tasted OK, it was just a little on the sweet side for our taste. The flavor kind of reminded me of a Sloppy Joe.  I don't think I'd make it again unless I can't find a better recipe.

This recipe was too sweet for our liking. If we make it again, we would eliminate the ketchup. We spent a lot of time trying to tone down the sweet flavor and never really got there.

This tasted like spaghetti sauce on our hot dogs, which was not tasty to us at all. I ended up dumping in a LOT of chili powder to counteract the sweetness and salvage the chili.

I grew up with this style of chili and have always tried to duplicate it but was never successful.  Finally - the perfect recipe.  I made it for a cookout at work and everyone loved it.  Definitely my go to recipe from now on.

I have been using this recipe since I found it here a year ago.  I love it, my family loves it (even the young grand-children) and friends. Always get compliments. I do not change a thing. Other than taste, I also love it because the ingredients are simple. I usually don't have to go to the store to get something I don't keep on hand.  It does not need any changes. Simple and delicious. Isn't that what we all want? It's never runny when I cook it. I do let it simmer with a lid on the pot for 30-45 mins.

This recipe was quick, easy and yummy!  If you let the chili sit for a few minutes after cooking it thickens up.  I also added a little garlic powder.

I make this  whenever  we so chili dogs. Use some better than bullion beef instead of plain water. I don't have onion powder on hand but just sauté some onions with the beef. Outstanding chili for hotdogs. Thank you!!

This recipe is great!  It could use a little kick so I added cayenne and paprika. Also, the second time I made it I used low sugar ketchup...much better!  It was a little too sweet with the regular ketchup.

Made this the other night for a Baked Chili Dog Casserole I found on Pinterest. I did throw in a 28 oz. can of pinto beans, (drained of all but very of  the little bean liquids) and didn't add the water. I simmered it on low heat for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it was pretty thick. It made more than enough for 6 hot dogs and was really yummy even the next, day in a bowl for lunch with some shredded cheese and chopped onion on top, minus the hot dog and bun of course!  I think this will be my new Go-To recipe for chili night!

Great base recipe. Used all ingredients listed, but changed amounts slightly and added a beef bouillon cube.  Here's what I amended:  1.5 lbs 85/15 beef, 8oz can tomato sauce, 3t chili powder, doubled the sugar. Make sure you boil beef rather than browning it separately or it won't have the  correct consistency and texture.  Best hot dog chili I've found and won't use the store bought stuff again.  Kids loved it also.

I wanted to like this but it was just too sweet and we only used half the sugar we were supposed to. Maybe next time we won't use any sugar or ketchup and just use tomato sauce and see if that helps.

Super easy recipe.  I did like other reviewers and browned 93/7 ground beef and drained the fat than added the water, tomatoes etc.....  I personally didn't care for the taste.  It was too ketchuping for me.  I did not add the sugar.  Maybe that would have calmed down the vinegar taste but since ketchup has so much sugar already in it and we are a health conscience family, I omitted it.  All that said, my husband LOVED it and he's who I was trying to impress.  So, it gets 4 stars from me since he loved it and I not so much (-;

Perfect! I went by the recipe exactly, and it was just as good or better than any store brand I've ever had in my entire life! Although it didn't taste that good by itself  ( no chili does ),
 when I paired it with slaw it brought me back to my childhood! I don't even buy store-bought chili anymore. Don't have to!!

I used the rotel tomatos with green chillis after running them through the food proccessor and a Tbl of tomato paste and water. I also added garlic powder and onion powder. No sugar but a Tbls of mustard. I used the ketsup but I think that is probably why I felt it needed the mustard. It was a bit sweet for me until I added mustard.  I always let chilli cook down for an hour. Very good!

Great stuff, almost like my mom's.  I made 1st just like your recipe read and it was really good.  Next batch I replaced the chili powder and tomato sauce for 1 cup of Heinz Chili Sauce. Both ways make perfect toppers for dogs or burgers, heck even good mixed in with baked beans.

This is a great recipe that's easily adaptable to your own tastes.
I used tomato paste in place of ketchup and used a whole cup of water. I also added some cayenne, garlic powder, cumin, and liquid smoke.
I cooked and drained my beef first, because I misread the directions.

Followed recipe except added one tsp sugar and a dash of chili powder. I am not a big fan of the mushy texture so next time I will not mash the meat and eliminate the water. Otherwise it's a fairly good recipe for hot dogs.

My husband and I followed the instructions - we could only find an 8 oz tomato sauce can, so we measured out 5 oz, and we did put a lid on it to cook once we'd stirred in all the ingredients, looking in now and again to stir. It was the best hot dog chili I've ever had. Delicious and so very easy! This is now our go-to chili. You can't buy anything this good around here, not even from a restaurant.

This recipe worked out PERFECTLY for me! I only made 3 slight changes, just to enhance the flavor. Instead of Worcestershire (which I realized I was out of and needed a replacement) I used low sodium soy sauce, and since I was also out of tomato sauce I replaced it with condensed tomato soup. Everything else was the same, but I added an extra ingredient for a kick: paprika. WONDERFUL flavor and I will definitely be using it in the future

Made this last week. Very very good good. I would disagree with some reviewers saying it was too thin. I think it was just right. If you think yours is too thin for your taste just cook it down a little more. The flavor i think was excellent. I made a minor modification by cooking it in a cast iron dutch oven in my outdoor smoker (which i highly recommend). Its definitely a great base recipe to modify for your needs. I recommend making it as directed the first time and check to see how you would like to adjust it from there.

The recipe is very good and easy to make, I believe it's the best hot dog chili recipes I've tried to date.  The next time though I may reduce the chili powder by 1/2 tsp and use just 2. Overall excellent!

I took this to the office pot luck for Memorial Day and it was a huge hit!  It was sweeter than I expected.  I think I will try it with diced onion next time.  I think I will also try it with tomato sauce with green chili as well.  The recipe was good, but my family would probably want something with a little more spice than sweet.

A step closer to my favorite recipe with Greek origins. I add just a little cinnamon (1/8 tsp) and some garlic. This is the right consistency, but not quite enough Bam! Next time I may cut back on suger, and worcestershire. Still this is very good.

Jeff...this is an awesome hot dog chili recipe! Thanks so much! I just made it for the first time, and when I tasted it I was tempted to eat it all like it was a bowl of chili.

Since I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand at the time, I substituted Bertolli Vidalia Onion with Roasted Garlic spaghetti sauce. I don't how that impacted the recipe, but it was YUMMY!

Great Chili! I did brown ground beef until it was a second from being done. Then I added all the other ingredients(the less greasy the better). I did expect it to be more flavor-"full" though. Overall, I enjoyed it and my 6 year old really loved it. Thanks for sharing!!

It was very good, and I will make it again. I didn't have onion powder on hand so I diced an onion and added it while browning the beef. Then poured off the fat. Otherwise I was able to follow the recipe. Spooned over my dogs with chopped onion and cheese, perfect!

Great for a fast dinner. I did not add any water, browned and drained the beef first, then added the ingrediants as listed. I used whole wheat buns and served with baked sweet potato fries on the side.

Followed recipe to a T except I had no onion powder so I threw in some dried minced onion instead. DELICIOUS! I like to make a day ahead, then refrigerate so the fat congeals and I can easily remove. Very, very tasty!

Great hot dog chill. My husband loves it. You can play around with the recipe to add a different twist.

I thought this was pretty good, not amazing. I found it a little bland even though I added a fair bit more chili powder. I liked the texture of the meat though and the consistency of it overall, and it was very easy to make. I'd make again if I wanted chili dogs. I also had this over baked potatoes and that was decent too. Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed the smooth consistency of this chili. I used half lean beef and half lean pork as I am trying to get rid of some meat. My only complaint is that it was too sweet for me. I would definitely leave the sugar out next time as the ketchup alone added enough sweetness. To counteract the sweetness I added chili sauce and a little extra chili powder. Once I added the chili sauce it was perfect! Beautiful balance of sweet and spicy. I soaked up the grease that rose to the top when it was done cooking and sat for a few minutes. If you let it cook the full 20 minutes maybe 25 minutes this chili is not runny. Though I only used 8 oz of tomato sauce cause that's the size can I buy.

I really like the texture of the ground beef by using the potato masher and cooking in directly in the chili instead of beforehand. It made it like.. well hot dog chili instead of like hearty chili with no beans on a hot dog. The only change I had to make was by force because I didn't have regular canned tomato sauce I only had Rotel tomato sauce (not the diced Rotel tomatoes but actual Rotel tomato sauce.)
