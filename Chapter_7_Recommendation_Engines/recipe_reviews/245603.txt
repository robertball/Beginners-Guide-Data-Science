These were excellent. I will definitely make them again. At the advise of my friend that makes pizelles more than I do, I used land o lakes butter. They were delicious!

The batter was tasty but this does not make pizzeles, too fluffy! I have been making pizzeles for Christmas for 50 years and thought that I would spice it up a little. Went back to the old reliable recipe with anise and lemon zest

I've been making traditional anise flavored pizzelles for years.  This recipe provides a fresh twist on an old favorite and quickly became the Christmas favorite by my family.  I can't wait to make them again!
