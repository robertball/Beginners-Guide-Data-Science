Just made these tonight! They were pretty good! My family voted that we should make these again. We do prefer a regular blondie, but go for it if you want to try it. Almost like a coffee cake. Pumpkin isn't too overpowering. :) Nice change.

I don't know why it had to bake so ling but I had to bake this for 1 hour and 15 minutes. For some reason it just would not set.  After it cooled it was very dry but the best day it tasted better. Yes I would make it again. I didn't have any chips.  But I did sprinkle red sugar on it.

I followed the recipe but used butterscoth chips on top instead of  cinnamon.  Didnt care for them because they just were not sweet.  kinda bland really.  Dont know why because with all those ingredients they should have tasted better to me.

This was enjoyed BUT the batter was VERY hard to spread.  Plus they were not as sweet as I would have liked, there was a lot of cream cheese mix, which had no sugar content.  Regardless, they had a very good pumpkin flavor and a nice change from all the sugary desserts on TG :)
