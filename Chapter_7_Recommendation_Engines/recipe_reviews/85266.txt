I have been using this recipe as is for years. It is good. The flavor is just about spot on for Hidden Valley. My only complaint has been that it does not thicken like Hidden Valley especially for using as a dip. I also like the idea of using a buttermilk powder. So when I mixed up a batch this time, I did not use the saltines, but added a 1/2 cup buttermilk powder instead. The flavor is still great. When I mixed up the dressing, just used milk instead of buttermilk since I had used the powder. This recipe is great for using in other recipes, meals that ask for a package of dry Hidden Valley. It's way cheaper & of course far healthier. Also, I use good Celtic sea salt & don't like to use the premade onion & garlic salts because the table salt in it is horrible. So I omitted the garlic & onion salts, and instead did the conversions needed to add an extra tablespoon of garlic & onion powder & the salt separately. I worked out great. I'm experimenting now w/ added a bit of guar gum which is a natural thickener to see if I can thicken it up. Then it will be perfect! Also, my next experiment will be to mix some up using greek yogurt instead of mayo to see how that tastes & see if I can make it a nice lite ranch!

This mix is just what it claims to be a dry ranch mix. You can add or sub but this base is good on its own. Do not omit the crackers as it lends the texture and a certain flavor. Measure out as needed for recipes. I've used it in a dip and in a chicken marinade recipe and both had the flavor I was looking for.

First, I cut this down to 4 servings.  I made this to use in the "ranch oyster crackers" from this site.  I omitted the saltine crackers, used 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/8 tsp onion salt (watching our salt intake).  I had a dill mix from the pampered chef.  This made a nice and mild flavor to the oyster crackers (wasn't over powering in our soup).  I will make this into salad dressing next.

not sure how to quite rate this, as it was a base to what I actually made... I used the dried parsley, garlic salt, onion salt, onion powder, garlic powder, dried dill weed but subbed 1/2 cup dried buttermilk for saltines.  also used teaspoons instead of cups for smaller batch.  was a good base though.

JACKPOT!! This is the recipe I've been all over the web and Pinterest looking for. Simple ingredients, simple assembly. It tastes... I would say better than bottled ranch but it's SO much better it's like a different dressing. My dislike for the bottled dressing has been growing for years. I remember when Hidden Valley Ranch first came out - it didn't have buttermilk powder in it. After mixing it up I just wanted to drink it from the jar it was so good. I've NEVER wanted to drink the bottled Ranch or HVR with buttermilk powder. Not even in the same galaxy IMO. Now I have a dedicated mixing jar, wide mouthed so I can whir it up with my stick blender, and a dedicated refrigerator container as well, which is an empty plastic honey jar with the mess-free squirt top. I don't like measuring mayonnaise in a measuring cup because it's messy so I place the jar on my kitchen scale, zero it out, and add 8 oz mayo, 8 oz buttermilk, 4 oz sour cream, and the dry mix. In another recipe, I read about adding 2 t dill pickle juice, boosting the tanginess and also the dill flavor, which I love. I intend to keep it mixed up and on hand from now on. This is a delicious recipe.

I scaled this to 18 servings to use for the "spinach roll-ups" recipe on Allrecipes and everything turned out incredible! The only substations I made were that I used all onion powder instead of onion powder and onion salt, I added some dried chives because I accidentally bought them for this recipe before realizing that a different ranch recipe called for them, and I used onion flavored brown rice snaps instead of saltines due to food allergies. I haven't been able to have ranch dressing or mix since being diagnosed with allergies and am so excited to have this recipe! Next, I'll try making dressing with it. Thank you for the simple and delicious recipe!

Great base recipe easy to substitute for what you have on hand at the moment or another herb/spice you want to use and easy to cut down to smaller recipe. makes a perfect ranch dip or dressing using mayo/sour cream/and small amount of milk that you have soured slightly with vinegar or lemon to thin it out for dressing rather than "dip" THANK YOU>>>> saves so much money and I do NOT like bottled ranch

I love this mix, and have made it many times. I follow the recipe pretty much, but have subbed garlic and onion powders with a dash of regular salt when I don't have onion or garlic salt. It works in any recipe that calls for a packet of ranch, but is way more natural. It's also delicious sprinkled in macaroni salad or tuna salad. Thanks for a great recipe!

When I make this dressing, I freeze the buttermilk.  When i thaws I drain off the watery liquid and use one cup of the remains.  This helps it be thicker.

I cut the servings down to 50 and it was almost enough to fill an empty spice container. I was missing the onion salt so I added a pinch of kosher salt. The cracker equaled 1 saltine at 50 servings. I blended this in my magic bullet mixer. This turned out better than I expected. I am going to bake a pizza and butter the outer crust after baking then sprinkle this ranch mix onto the buttered crust for a ranch flavored crust. (I need to say crust one more time...crust)

No more seasoning packets! I scaled the mix way back to 10.  I want to try it out before I make a years supply.  That produced about 2 packets worth of seasoning mix.  I put half in a season jar and put in in the rack, and with the other half I made ranch dip.  Also, I added about a tbsp of dry milk.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as written with the exception of using round butter crackers rather than saltines which I never have on hand.  It is very tasty but I find it quite salty so next time I will cut the onion salt and garlic salt down to 1/4 cup each.  I will mix up another whole batch and leave out all the salts and mix it in with the batch I just made to even out the salt content.   I made a Sour Cream Ranch Dip Topping to put over baked potatoes.

Home made is always better. I added 1/2 cup flour to thicken (it worked well).

I first tried this recipe to use as holiday gifts, but now I use it interchangeably with my standby that has buttermilk powder in it.  I think the addition of the cracker crumbs are what really make this recipe stand out.  They add something to the flavor and really improve the thickness and texture.

Used as a quick fix when a recipe called for the packaged ranch dressing mix - didn't have the butter milk but never missed it!  Great when you're watching sodium, too!

Thanks for a real recipe. We're gluten free, so I ditched the saltines, but otherwise top notch, thanks!

I scaled this down to 50 servings, and I have some left for other recipes.  I like keeping something like this in my pantry in little cleaned-out used jars (be sure to label them, though, because you DO forget!).  The only thing I didn't have was onion salt, but I just added a touch of sea salt and that seemed to be just fine.  I found it interesting that it called for saltines!  I had no idea how that would work.  We liked this a lot and will use it again!  Thanks for this recipe!
