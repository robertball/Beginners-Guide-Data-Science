Good easy recipe to follow however I wanted my cookies thick and chewy so here is what I did- I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I cut the white sugar down to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup brown sugar for moisture. I upped the flour to 2 3/4 cup. Changing the recipe as such produced very workable dough which I rolled into balls. I baked the cookies at 350F for 11 minutes and let cool on the pan for 3 minutes. Perfect chocolate cookies that taste like chewy fudgy brownies. They stay moist and chewy in the cookie jar very well.

Too sweet, too greasy and not as thick as I would have liked, even after chilling the dough.  A real disappointment.

So many of the reviews warn that these cookies come out too flat. I used some baking powder and that completely eliminated that problem. They're fluffy and tasty. I also added some white chocolate chips and they were just sinful. The only problems that I ran into were these: I made a double batch to take camping and that was a completely obscene amount of cookies, also, they did not travel well. They tended to crumble easily.

This exact recipe is an old family favorite! It's a very easy recipe to follow, and it's pretty quick! You can also shake things up by adding nuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit, etc.
If the cookies aren't sweet enough, try glazing with powdered sugar + hot water. You can coat them, drizzle them, etc.

Delicious! We had a recipe like this when I was growing up. They are a bit tempermental while cooking. Undercooking makes them gooey, overcooking makes them crunchy. It may take a sheet or two to get them just right, but well worth it!!!

I found these cookies to be perfect the way the recipe was written but I did make a small change and that was to switch the sugar to 1c and 3/4 brown sugar other then that they were fantastic,. My grand-daughter made this while I watched and now her mother (my daughter) can't keep her hands of them.  Again an amazing cookie. Thanks for sharing

These cookies are perfect for a chocolate craving when all you have in the house is cocoa powder!!  I for one LOVE a crisp-edged chewy cookie rather than a cakey one, so these were right up my alley!  Since I was out of white sugar, I used all brown and I was also short maybe 1/8 c. butter.  The only real change I made was adding a cup of shredded coconut!  Mmmmmm!

I made it exactly as the recipes said.  It was amazing!  I love this recipe.  I made sure to keep it at the right baking time.  Mine was about 8 minutes and they were soft.  If you like them crunchy then maybe 10 minutes would work.  Thanks for the recipe! I will make them again with chocolate chunks in them! Delish!

These cookies are amazing. I think they would taste good with white chocolate chips and/or macademia nuts, but 1 cup of sugar is enough.

It was nearing grocery shopping day, and my oldest was begging to make cookies for Santa but I didn't have much on hand. I typed some ingredients into a seach engine and found this. I dislike baking with margarine but did it anyway. I also added a tsp. of baking powder as one reviewer said it combated the problem of the cookies being flat. Maybe I didn't add enough because my cookies were very flat and spread lots. Regardless, they were delicious! Classic, chewy, and chocolatey, they looked like cookies you get at a bakery. I can see us making them every year for Santa as they just strike me as perfect timeless chocolate cookies that you set out on Christmas eve with a big glass of milk. Thanks so much for this recipe!

These were delicious! I have been trying to find a recipe like this that tasted like a brownie but was a cookie... these are them! Since i made them for CHRISTmas, i crushed up some red Andy's mints and added them to my dough, well they came out delicious! I would definitely call  this one of my favorite cookies! Thanks!

Always turns out, even when I put in too much or not enough of another!!!  I sometimes add a bit of black pepper and cayenne, sometimes I turn them into mini-brownies by baking in muffin cups, always delicious!

this is a really great cookie. its chewy and tasty. was easy to make and i used a small cookie scoop to form dough. i only had half butter and half shortening at home so thats what i used. it flattened alot but tasted really good. i tried topping some with peanut butter but it spreads too much. maybe better with some chips or goodies throughout. thanks for the tasty treat

This recipe was a great guide. I used an earlier reviewers suggestions of changing the white sugar to 1C and adding 1/2C of brown sugar and changing the flour to 2 3/4C. I also added one tsp. of almond extract. Delish!

I'm sad to give this recipe only 3 stars. They are pretty tasty but following this recipe exactly as is leads to some pretty fail cookies. The dough was somewhat dry and crumbly, the cookies did not flatten on their own (which is weird since that is what other reviewers complained about), they actually stuck to my non-greased non-stick cookie sheet, after baking for nearly 15 min and allowing to cool completely they were extremely soft and delicate, they had an oily/greasy feel to them, and they had a gritty texture.  I've made many cookies in the past, so I have a good bit of experience, and the more changes I noted I will have to make, the more I disliked this recipe. If I ever make this recipe again, it will only be in small batches for my own personal satisfaction and chocolate fix since these cookies are not presentable for special gatherings and occasions.

Pretty good! Although, I halved the recipe to make it for 15 and it still made 21 cookies that were pretty large. They fall apart when I was taking them off the sheet though that may just be my lackluster cooking skills. Definitely recommend!

very good and very easy.  Didnt have butter so substituted butter flavored crisco, am lazy so used self-rising flour instead of all -purpose plus the rising agents, and just to be diferent used 1 teaspoon of coconut flavoring plus 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring (extract) instead of the two tsp. of vanilla that was in the original recipe.  my version made 6 dozen regular size cookies, i dont know how the original recipe only made 30 cookies!  my family loved them, will definately make them again, however i will lower the amount of shortening used because they were a tad greasy for my taste.  Also, am curious about substituting half of the shortening with peanut butter for a reese's taste. Over all, darn good!!!!

These are perfect chewy brownie cookies! 9 mins in the oven is perfect and then you HAVE to let them sit for 2 mins (like instructed) before removing to a cooling rack. They will be gooey to the touch after 9 mins but if you let them sit they harden up. LOVE this recipe.

Made these delicious cookies one day when the kiddos wanted to bake something, but I didn't have any chocolate chips in the house.  Now this is one of our very favorites.  Easy, fast and yummy.  I like to sift a little powdered sugar on top just to dress them up.

these are wonderful!!!! I also added about 1 teas. of baking powder to give them a bit of puffiness. We all love cinnamon so I added about 1 teas as well as some white chocolate chips!!!! Talk about decadent!!!   Thanks for sharing!!!

After reading other reviews made the following adjustments:  1c. sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 2 3/4 c. flour.  Refrigerated dough for about half hour and used pampered chef small scoop; topped with half a chocolate mint candy and baked a minute more to melt candy (then swirled candy). YUM!! Was very happy with the outcome.  Will make again.

I found this recipe to be a good starting point. I have been making it, always adding at leat 1/4 cup more flour. Next time, I will try cjs_mama's version because it sounds like it'll fix the recipe's problems, but i'm still not sure whether I'll do the shortening or not.

Warning:  I didn't try the recipe as written, so I'm not sure how it would turn out without adjustments!!  

I know many reviewers noted that the cookies were really flat.  I think that it's because of the high amount of sugar in the original recipe.   Sugar acts as a liquifier in baked goods. Because of this, I only used 1 cup of (brown)sugar (for more flavor).  Also, I only used 1 cup of butter, because that's all I had, and white whole wheat all-purpose flour.  The cookies were a tiny bit on the dry side.  They didn't take long to bake at all. Next time, I'll try 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  I liked that they didn't spread much, and stayed like little mountains.  For more flavor, I added a little cinnamon to the dough, and chocolate chips and walnuts, too.  Lastly, I glazed them with a cinnamon sugar glaze while they were still warm.  All in all, they turned out pretty darn good. I will definitely make them again.

These had great flavor but flattened out too much for my tastes. I prefer a puffy cookie and will try this recipe again with  baking powder instead. I loved the flavor and will make these again.

The taste is awesome. I used the recipe as is, but I sprayed a little Pam for baking on the cookie sheets.  Never would they have worked out on ungreased cookie sheets.  I baked them for 11 minutes, let them cool 5 before removing from the sheets.  That seemed to work best.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on the cooled cookies and they really tasted great.  However, they are flatter than pancakes.  Not sure why, but it didn't make them any less delicious.

Great cookie, I tweaked it a little by adding a hersheys cordial cherry kiss pushed into warm cookie then put back into oven just a minute to melt then pushed a maraschino cherry into the melted kiss and topped with melted milk chocolate.
