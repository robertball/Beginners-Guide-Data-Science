This is delicious-- almost has the consistency of a chocolate chip muffin, so I don't think frosting is necessary.

The cake was very dense and needed the frosting that I added. It was good but not sure I would make it again real soon.

Potential! The flavor complexity of the red wine & chocolate was great, I would make sure to use a full-bodied wine with chocolate or berry notes.    Mine too came out thick and dry, but I'm 100% sure I've figured out why:  I tried to cream the butter sugar & eggs together at the same time and all the liquid made the butter clump so I over beat it and the eggs filled out.  I bet if I creamed the butter and sugar THEN gradually added the eggs I could get that thick gooey brownie-like consistency in the picture.  I'll keep trying!

I thought this cake was good but too dried and dense.  I made a chocolate red wine ganache to put on top and it helped moisten the cake.

I wrote down the ingredients, so all i need to do now is buy a bowl, a spoon, oh, and the actual ingredients themselves, and of course find someone to cook it for me, but it looks like it would taste great. Hvala.  -Gabbanski

I had some leftover red wine and a chocolate craving, so I halved the recipe and put it in a 9x9 pan (baked at 360 for 20 minutes) to make a thin cake. Taking the advice from other reviewers, I beat the eggs and the butter and then added the eggs individually. It was moist and fluffy and the taste was great for a late night snack. I will make this again.

I followed the directions and amounts to the tee.  The results were a delicious, moist chocolate cake.  I did not ice it.  I felt like it was fine the way it was.  Very easy to make, although I agree with a previous reviewer on the order of the ingredients.  This cake is not exceptionally sweet but it is sweet.  I would definately make this again.

I had some leftover red wine, so I decided to make this cake.  I used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 splenda, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  After tasting the finished product, I think this recipe needs salt.  I also think the directions need to be re-ordered so the red wine is added after the vanilla and then the flour and finally, the chocolate chips; especially when using an electric mixer. I also used a 9x13 pan and cut 15 pieces, as the calories for 8 pieces was way too high.  The chocolate chips make the cake.

I thought it would need icing, but it was nice and moist.  I used my home made Christmas wine and the cake had a little more kick.  The chocolate chips make the cake.  Next time I want to try white chocolate chips.

My group loved this cake. It's got a very rich taste and I think is sweet enought without any icing.

This cake has nice flavor, but has a very dry dense texture. I followed the recipe to the tee, except that I used two  8 inch pans. I was very disappointed as I have been looking for a wonderful moist cake that I could use leftover red wine. Perhaps it needs for liquid or oil? I didn't expect this kind of texture considering how much butter is in this recipe.

The cake was dry on the outside, and moist on the inside so I added a chocolate glaze. I also could not taste the wine though. Not to sweet, just perfect. I followed the recommendations from previous comments, creaming the butter and sugar first, then adding the egg. I then added the vanilla and red wine. I mixed together in a separate bowl the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder then blended the dry and liquid mix together with an electric mixer. Instead of a pan, i baked it into a silicon bundt pan for about 1h10 minutes. I also put chocolate red wine glaze which is a recipe from the port wine cake here in allrecipes.com. You can see the result above in the pictures.

I was pretty disappointed with this cake.  It's quite dense and, despite all of the butter and eggs (and not over-baking), mine was rather dry-ish and crumbly.  I think I'm going to cube it up and make a trifle out of it - moisten it with some espresso or Kahlua and layer it with some pudding and whipped cream.  I won't be making this cake again and next time I'll just toss the wine I was trying to use up.

Cake is very heavy and dry.  I thought the batter looked brownyish, so I spread the batter like a brownie and only cooked it for about 38-39 minutes.  Like brownies you cant over bake, so you take the brownies out early....so, I did this with the cake.  It has possibilities, I would take out the wine, which you don't taste anyway and maybe some oil....I'd have to try it.  There are other great chocolate cakes out there that a much better than this cake.....

This was baked in two mini-Bundt pans. Since several reviewers noted the density or dryness of the cake, I increased the wine (Fairbanks Port, which I thought was too dry to be labeled Port) to 3/4 cup. With that and no chocolate chips [instead Ghirardelli sweet cocoa & chocolate and one Hershey's mini (chipped)], the cake tasted like a mild Spice cake. It was dry, just BLAND! NOT a hit at my office party. What was a hit was the chocolate frosting I made. 
So, now I have an unfrosted cake and 11 out of 16 slices of a frosted one. Total calories on the frosted cake for 16 slices was 232. Do I chuck it, experiment with the best way to eat the frosted or make a punch bowl cake for my church gathering on Saturday evening? This is REALLY disappointing, that something that people wouldn't even offer a review of, could cost so much to make!
