My Mother made these for years.  She is 90 years old now.  I was checking to see if the recipe was here.  She learned this from her grandmother.  Her recipe uses 2 cups of mashed potatoes, 1.5 sugar, 2 eggs, 4 tlbsp shortening, 4 tblsp powered buttermilk, 4-6 cups of flour, 2 teaspn baking powder, 1 teaspn nutmeg 1teaspn baking soda, 1 teaspn salt 1 cup of water.  She made donuts and the holes were a plus.  Everyone I knew loved them, and they would disappear fast.   They are as good as any donut shop has.

I lowered the amount of baking soda to 3 tsp. for my elevation of over 2500 feet and it worked great.  I tried using lemon, cherry and also strawberry extracts instead of vanilla with very good results.  Nut and butter flavoring works the best we think though. I really like these. They remind me of childhood.

Delicious!!  I make these vegan and gluten free and they still turn out great!  The modifications that I make are: 1/2 oat flour (or ground oatmeal in my Vitamix), 1/2 Bob's Red Mill all purpose g/f flour, ground flax seed/water mixture for eggs, organic cane sugar for white sugar, and sour almond milk for buttermilk.  I rolled the holes in cinammon and sugar when they were done and everyone loved them!

Well, they were just 'OK' for us.  A little dry, heavy and bland.  Would likely not make again after having made others on the site.
