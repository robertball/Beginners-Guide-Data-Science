Great Recipe - Place tomatoes, oil, oregano, salt and pepper in a zip lock bag to coat tomatoes - much easier and not as messy.

I took MinnesotaGirl's lead and roasted a medium zucchini with the tomatoes. I did have to increase the EVOO for the roasting by an additional two tablespoons. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. This pasta dish is WONDERFUL. I wanted a meatless meal for this week--I'll tell you, we didn't even miss the meat! I served this with buttered crusty italian bread and it was a filling and delicious meal.

Great way to use up those grape and cherry tomatoes (had an entire shoe box full)!  I find that using a potato masher works well to break up the tomatoes.  I also roasted a zucchini and threw it in because it needed to cooked.  Used fresh herbs from the garden and a healthy shake of red pepper flakes because we like a lot of spice -  highly adaptable to suit your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe idea but I changed it so much I'm not sure which recipe I'm rating. I used the plastic bag trick suggested by another reviewer and added about a half of a sweet onion quartered. Then put it all on a roasting pan lined in parchment paper. They roasted for 20 minutes with a turn about halfway thru. I saut√©ed 3 garlic cloves in olive oil and added some fresh pesto spiced with red pepper. When the tomatoes were done, i just funneled  the parchment paper and poured it all in the pan with the garlic. After boiling pasta, I added a good splash, maybe a half cup, of the pasta water to the mix. Easy, fast and a good way to use all the tomatoes. Next time I think I will roast a red pepper along with the tomatoes and onions and then throw it all in a food processer and make a smooth sauce.

What a great recipe! I did change/add the following and it was simply outstanding!!! I doubled it, and purchased the 19oz bag of frozen Tortellini from the freezer section as it was WAY more affordable. 
I added zucchini, a yellow pepper and red onion to the tomato in the oven and threw all veggies in a bag and added oil and spices that way (easier, and you use less oil). 
Save some of the pasta water to add to the entire mixture if it's a little too dry, and then top with a quick splash of quality EVOO, sea salt, crushed red pepper flakes and crumbled goat cheese.

Wow!!!   I made this for my mother yesterday who loves everything authentic Italian.   She has been to Italy many times and she said this was the way the Italians ate.  Light with not too much sauce.   I have to say, I will make this many times in the future.   I felt like it was truly the delicious taste of a great chef.   Wow!!!!  I didn't change anything except I didn't have spicy pesto so I just added some cayenne pepper to the pesto.   It was all good!!!   SO easy!!!

I followed the recipe exactly aside from a bit more olive oil, and it was amazingly easy, yummy, complex, and satisfied the pickiest eater (my hubby). I might try adding a splash of balsamic vinegar, but hubby said it was perfect as is. Wonderful!!!

I used our bumper crop of smaller toms and cored the tops off, using the idea of sandwich bags to coat.  They were in the oven for about 20 minutes until splitting then I mashed/cut them up, seeds, skin and all.  I also added two T of prepared pesto because... We love pesto!  (I doubled the recipe).  Will make again!

I added a zucchini and an onion to the roasting stage.  It may have overcrowded the oven and kept some of the tomatoes from cooking at the proper rate, so I will adjust for that next time.  All in all, this was a delicious meal!

I made this today ad my husband and I really liked it. The only change I made was adding a 1/2 tea. sugar to cut any bitterness of the tomatoes. I always add sugar to cooked tomatoes.

very good recipe. i added some balsalmic vinegar to the oil/salt/pepper mixture to coat the tomatoes. i used sunflower kitchen zest-o pesto as this is my favorite pesto. i used more basil leaves than required and i used way more fresh grated parmesan chz. i also like to chop up the stems of the basil and put in the olive oil when you put in the garlic...it gives it more flavor. i will keep this recipe to make for many more occasions. thx!

We loved this, absolutely delicious!  I used raviolis instead of tortellinis, I don't think it much matters, the secret is the preparation of the cherry tomatoes.  My Parmesan had gone off but I had shredded 4-way Mexican cheese and substituted that, worked great.  I didn't have spicy Pesto but had Costco brand Pesto, worked great.  Next time I'm going to add prawns, the possibilities are endless.

I really liked this dish. It has a very sophisticated taste. The only change I made was the pasta as I used rotinis - I think that's what they're called - tubes as my grandson would say. This is a dish you'd pay $$$$ dollars for at the best of Italian restaurants. Would also be good with Portobello mushrooms or even shrimp added. I served the dish with crusty garlic Italian bread. Good stuff and easy to make.

A great recipe, I added some  fresh sauted mushrooms as I had quite a few in stock and increased the  amount of pesto to make it more spicy.

have not tried it yet but it seems to me that it would be faster to roll those tomatoes around in a bowl first and then drizzle on whats left.

Loved this fresh tasting meal! I was a little skeptical about this dish as it was so easy and used few ingredients. Was I wrong! This recipe is great and gives you summer flavour all year round. Everyone asked that this become a staple in our house.

This was a very tasty and fast weeknight dinner! I doubled the cherry tomatoes becasue I had a bunch to use up. I substituted spinach ricotta ravioli for the tortellini as that was what I had. The tomatoes were awesome, would definitely make again.

I love this recipe and make it a lot, but use spaghetti squash more often then tortellini to bring the calories down some and make it a lighter meal.  I also go a little heavier on the garlic and oregano.

This recipe is wonderful. I used the spinach/ricotta filled tortellini and also included a medium sized zucchini and garnished with fresh basil from my garden. Definitely a recipe that demands repeat performances!

Excellent flavor with the roasted tomatoes and pesto sauce.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe because it didn't make enough to satisfy my family.  My 19 yr. old picky eater son,  who doesn't like a lot of food I fix, thought this was great.

My family liked it. It needed a little something towards flavor. Next time I may add more pesto. I used the idea of mixing it all in the bag and pouring it onto parchment as others suggested. Also roasted the garlic with the tomatoes and onion to have less to clean up. It will be tried again. Thanks!

Loved it! So light and fresh, but full of flavor! My husband wants me to put some sort of protein in it next time to help it stick to your stomach. But it was really yummy!
