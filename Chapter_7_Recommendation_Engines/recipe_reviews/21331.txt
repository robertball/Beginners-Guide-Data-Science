I was so intrigued, just had to try this with canned tomatoes since they're not in season. I didn't even use the olive oil, just tossed the tomatoes in the pan, heated them and then poached the eggs. We made it into a Mexican-style dish, putting the eggs and tomatoes on a tortilla with beans and cheese, etc. So yummy and we were amazed how tender and moist the eggs were. Yummy and great! TFS

Having just returned from Italy and the Tuscany region, I was introduced to this dish.  Though I couldn't imagine the combination of eggs and tomatoes, I was happily taken by surprise.  This recipe represents the same dish I had in Italy and should be tried.

My dad used to make this all the time. I was so excited to see the recipe here! I made it for dinner tonight and my husband gave it a two thumbs up. I did two things differently: 1) I removed the skins from the tomatoes by plunging them into hot water, and 2) I gently sauteed chopped onions with the oil before adding the chopped tomatoes. Next time I'll try this with sauteed tri-color bell pepper and kick it up a knotch by adding a few flakes of chili pepper. Adding fresh chopped up Italian herbs also adds great flavour. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this growing up.  Having grown up in a Italian household this was my choice of food when I wanted a fast breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Still love eating it.  This is the best!!!!

mmm... I picked the last of this season's Roma tomatoes today and chose this recipe so I could enjoy their fresh taste.  And enjoy it I did!  Couldn't resist adding some fresh basil to the tomatoes (I used 6 small-ish peeled romas per one egg, quartered) and a small amount of sugar.  Just the right proportion of sauce to poach the egg.

This is so easy to make and so perfect when you have tomatoes from the garden.  We love it and make it all the time when tomatoes are in season.  We've begun adding other yummy veggies like mushrooms and squash with complete success.

I think if you like tomatoes and eggs, you will love this one, but for some reason I just wasn't feeling it.  My eggs got fried (I don't like fried eggs) and not kind of soft poached like in the photos here.  Could have been the teflon pot I was using.  Also, I thought that the egg and tomato combination was very acidic, but that could have been my tomatoes.

Easy and delicious! I LOVE EGGS! After eating this several times, I had a leftover bottle of salsa verde and thought, "hey, why not?" Turned out wonderful! Something about poaching the eggs in a sauce rather than water seems to give them a better texture and is just plain easier!

I used canned tomatoes and seasoned quite a bit with oregano and Italian seasoning. Added a little mozerella towards the end of cooking as well. Wow! The whole thing turned out muh tastier than I expected. I'm always looking for new ways to do my morning eggs and I'm excited to do this one again. I'm going to add some mushrooms next time, I think.

This simple recipe is very good, a nice light flavorful alternative to the scrambled eggs/omletes I usually make for breakfast or lunch. I did serve alongside fresh baked bread and together they were amazing. I personally added a few sprinkles of Italian seasoning but I don't think extra spices are required, in the future I'll make as written because the fresh tomatoes, eggs and olive oil are perfect just themselves. Thanks for sharing.

So easy, I might be able to make it again without reading the directions; and, so yummy, I'm sure I'll get a chanct to try! Great way to use up some garden tomatoes and basil.

I have never eaten tomatoes with eggs before. Growing up, my family took "plain food" to the next level! This was so simple, easy, and just plain delicious! I wouldn't recommend cutting out the olive oil. Tomatoes and olive oil make an amazing taste together. Thanks for sharing this!!!

This was excellent.  I did add a clove of crushed garlic to the pan before I put the tomatoes in.  I did take the seeds out of the tomatoes first and there was still quite a bit of liquid that took more than 3-5 minutes to reduce.  That said, it was just a wonderful meal.  Thank you for this recipe!  Oh, served it with toasted homemade country bread.

This is so simple and delicious! I added some basil and really didn't think it was necessary. I also put it over a grilled cheese sandwich for my lunch today and it was great!

I added some garlic and served it all on slices of toasted, buttered rustic Italian bread.  Delicious!  I've also made it with canned crushed tomatoes when I don't have fresh ones, and it's pretty good that way, too.

This was pretty good. Easy to make.  The eggs took a lot longer than expected to cook with all the liquid from the tomatoes.

Don't know what I did wrong here.  it's a simple recipe.  I didn't have french or italian bread; instead I used onion rolls I already had...didn't think that would matter.  Tomatoes too ripe?  There was so much juice I ended up cooking the eggs in a separate pan. Granted, I've never tried this recipe, but I couldn't imagine cracking an egg into so much liquid.  The end result was inedible.  Bland.... Maybe this needs to have the sentimental value attached to taste right.  Sorry, but I had my first failed and disappointing experience w/ an allrecipes.com recipe tonight.  The only saving grace was the hamburger staek w/ gravy I prepared on the side.

I just have to say that I *love* recipes that are so simple with just a few ingredients, but are so delicious. This was so good! I served it on some buttered homemade sourdough toast. Definitely will be making this a lot!

Great for Lent! Put a 15-oz can of Italian diced tomatoes in a small frying pan and break 4 eggs into the tomatoes. Cover and cook until eggs are poached. Serve over buttered toast or Italian bread and sprinkle with cheese.
