This recipe was a little spicy, so I added another can of beans.  I also added a splash of milk to make it creamier.  This is a quick and easy recipe.

We thought this was really tasty. I sauteed in a cast iron skillet in about 2 teaspoons olive oil. I didn't have taco seasoning, so my daughter suggested cumin, then we added chili powder, onion powder & garlic powder. We used 1/4 cup salsa instead of the tomato and we added about a tablespoonful of diced jalapeno plus juice. Thanks for a good idea!

I made almost exactly as written. Instead of using fresh tomatoes I actually added a can of Ro-tel (diced tomatoes with green chilis) right into the dip. I would make this over and over. Very good as leftovers for a spiced up bean dip or mexican pizza.

This is even better with Chihuahua cheese or queso cheese (as it's also called) instead of cheddar. I half the taco seasoning and use a teaspoon of cumin. Sooo good!

Very good! Didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand so I just used a can of plain diced. Turned out pretty good. Will be using this one again. So quick and yummy

This dip is just okay.  I added some sour cream to make it more creamy.

Good, but I cut back taco seasoning to 1/2 package and also added salsa because I didn't have tomato on hand.  Very good.  Thanks for recipe.

This was great. I was looking for a way, to spice up our refried beans, that we eat with chicken fajitas. Hubbie came along behind when I wasn't looking & added water. He thought they were burning. I didn't add the tomato until the end. I'm the only one that likes them. Added some of the cheese while cooking & topped with some. I also make homemade taco seasoning from this site & threw some in. Tasty, thanks!

Pretty good dip, although somewhat spicy.  I didn't have a full can of refried beans so I used less taco seasoning but it was stil a bit spicy, so I'd probably cut it down next time.  I also would like more tomatoes.  Bf decided to add avocado to the dip, which was good in it, and he also put sour cream on his.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very simple yet delicious.  I added a teaspoon of canned jalapenos to give some extra zip and moisture.
