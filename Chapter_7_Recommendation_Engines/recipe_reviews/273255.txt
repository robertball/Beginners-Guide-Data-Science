I'm wondering if the author of this recipe used basil Alfredo sauce rather than basil pesto sauce since it lists 14.5 ounces? Also, the video appears to show a white-colored sauce being added, whereas pesto sauce is green.

Really like this recipe.  With some crusty bread it's a very hardy meal.  Did substitute frozen spinach, thawed then squeezed in place of fresh.  Added as instructed but didn't cover and cook as instructed.  Awesome dish.

It was okay, but really oily.  I followed the recipe exactly, but there was too much pesto sauce.  If I make again, I would cut back the amount of wine and pesto sauce.

What a great combination. I followed the recipe exactly but changed only the amount of pesto sauce. I used 3 tbsp of fresh pesto Genovese rather than the curious amount in the recipe. This will be added to our household recipe repertoire. Thanks for a tortellini, spinach and sausage recipe without tomatoes and cream.

I made it exactly like the recipe only had a larger bag of fresh tortellini. It is so delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The only thing I did differently was use ground Italian sausage instead of the casting type and top with  parmesan cheese. The dish was flavorful and filling. I will definitely put this in rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

You need to clarify if the tri- cheese tortellini is fresh or dry.  I followed recipe and I used the fresh but I think it should have been cooked prior to mixing in with sausage.

As is, the recipe has a little too much sauce and sausage for the amount of tortellini.  I think the next time we make this, we'll increase the amount of tortellini.  I really liked the pesto flavoring rather than going with the usual tomato sauce base.

The only change I did was leave the spinach to be added by those in the family who wanted it.  We find that we do not enjoy the texture of the spinach when it cooks to much.   Family loved this recipe.  Next time I make this recipe I will add some chopped onion with the mushrooms.

Made this using a little more than half of the basil pesto shown in recipe after reading some of the reviews. It turned out wonderful and was an extremely tasty dish!

Taste's great, the two stars are because the recipe needs clarification.  The video shows a white sauce (I'm with you texasgal in duri) so they intend for you to use an alfredo sauce with pesto, not straight up pesto (14 ounces of which would make it super oily and  the flavor would be overpowering) The recipe needs to state that more clearly, and also should specify Fresh tortellini, because dry tortellini would not work as written. Not sure if frozen would work this way or not.

Wow!!  I added a 7oz jar of Rana basil pesto, then watched the video and realized it should have been an alfredo sauce.  So i just added a 15 oz  jar of bertolli alfredo.   it was delicious even with my mistake.  YUM YUM!!

I love the recipe. I added asiago cheese because it's my favorite.
I made a double batch and there was barely any left after the two boys were done. I did boil the tortellini ahead of time for two minutes.

This recipe is so versatile you can change it up each time. Next time I will make meatballs with ground beef and italian sausage.
