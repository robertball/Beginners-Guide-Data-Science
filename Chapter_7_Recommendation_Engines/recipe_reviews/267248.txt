Perfectly crunchy avocado fries! I have made a good deal of Bren's recipes and as usual, this recipe did not disappoint. The trickiest thing about this recipe is with the avocado purchase. You don't want one too firm but it has to be firm enough to hold up to the egg wash and breading process so avoid ones that are too ripe. Something important I want to point out. It looks like there was some confusion for the temp on the air fryer. Going off of her previous recipes I've made, the 200 degrees she calls for is celsius. For fahrenheit  you'll want to do 400 degrees. That is what I did and they were perfect. Thanks Bren for another great recipe!

Excellent. I made them gluten free, substituting with almond flour and gf panko. Nice and cruncy on the outside and creamy on the inside.

It was tasty but I think I would add the salt as needed directly to the avocado, it felt like it needed more seasoning. Other than that it was nice and creamy on the inside.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It was the perfect combo of crunchy outside and creamy inside. We ate these fries with salsa. 
I will make it again but next time try to add in some other spices like chili powder or garlic.

These turned out nice and crispy on the outside and creamy inside. The breading stayed in great too. The only thing I would change would be to have more spices in the breading, or maybe I could just make a spicier dipping sauce for them, but I will make them again!

Interesting. As a tempora lover I had never thought of using avocado. Not a air fryer fan. Going to try this one again in a deep fryer then decide which one I like best.
