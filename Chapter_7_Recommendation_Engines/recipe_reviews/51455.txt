Excellent cookie! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and instead of the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons allspice. That gave a slightly spicy taste. Also, I added about a 1/2 cup more raisins. Next time I will double the recipe-they went so fast! My 2 year old loved them!

I cut the recipe in half and followed it to a "T"; the result were TO DIE FOR:) They're kind of like a Snickerdoodle with raisons. Picky hubby took one bite and pronounced them "Yummy." Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe this afternoon for the first time.  Very good.  I like others added vanilla and a bit of allspice.  My husband always tells me that I'm always making cookies with chocolate in them, thus my search led me to this chocolate free recipe.

These cookies are a cross between a snickerdoodle and a sandie.  I love how thick and dense they come out.  I did half the batch with the raisins for my daughter and the other half with dried cranberries and chopped pecans for me.  And then I proceeded to eat five of them! This is a keeper.

Not what I expected but still good.  I used 1 C wheat flour and 1 C white.  These cookies are very dense and very sweet.  The first one I wasn't too sure about but the more I ate the more I liked them!

Excellent recipe!  I used less raisins and added some almonds, sliced.  As the almonds made the dough a bit dry I then added about 2 tbsp of maple syrup.

It turned out to be one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.

My husband loves these.  I made it for the first time today and I added the all spice and vanilla extract to it.  They were perfect.  So quick and easy to make.

I followed this recipe exactly as directed and they were great.  My kids loved them.  Next time, I will add a little vanilla as the other reviewers did.  This is a keeper!

Love these!  I used 1 Cup WWflour/1 Cup APflour~ i also added approx 1 teaspoon cinnamon, dashes of nutmeg, allspice, and cloves, and the tiniest pinch of ginger.  Really simple to make with a GREAT texture.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!!
My boyfriend, being a big raisin fan, absolutely loves these cookies :) 
They seem to go just right with a cup of milk.

Maybe 5 starts seems enthusiastic, but the balance of flavour, spice, raisins and cookie, and the ease of the process, deserves recognition!
