Exactly what I was looking for!  I omitted the dill due to allergies.  I simmered my matzo balls for 10 minutes then pulled them out and let them finish cooking in the soup to let them absorb some of the flavors.  Don't change a thing otherwise!

Awesome, flavourful recipe. Matzo balls are amazing, and the broth turned out well too, although I left out the dill. Definitely in the regular rotation.

I only used the matzo ball portion of this recipe, as I used my own soup recipe, but wow! My picky family LOVED it :)

My family loved the soup. Their only comment was that it needed more salt. We used parmesan cheese to make.up for the salt and will add parmesan to matza ball mixture.  I made the soup in pressure cooker and cut up the very tender veggies for soup.

This was a good base but required a lot of additional spices to have any flavor.

Made some minor changes due to food sensitivities, but it was still delicious!  Added lemon juice to coconut milk instead of buttermilk, used gluten free bread crumbs instead of A/P flour, and cooked in coconut oil.  Since my chicken breasts were so thick, I finished them off in the oven to not burn.  Turned out great.  Very flavorful and moist.
