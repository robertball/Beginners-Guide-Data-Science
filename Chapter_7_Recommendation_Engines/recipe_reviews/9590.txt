My mom used to make these when I was little and I just love them. A word of caution -- don't make these on a very hot/humid day or they won't set properly. I tried to make them for an August picnic and had to refrigerate them for them to set, but a few minutes out of the fridge and they were melty. I still ate them. With a spoon but, otherwise, these are yummy.

These are just like those; think they were called nuts and bolts, with carmel and the chow mein noodles instead of corn flakes.

We're only 13 and 15-years-old and we made this, and it's really good, we first made it with chocolate instead of butterscotch, and it's really good for those people out there who love chocolate as much as one of us does!  Thanks for letting us have this recipe!

Neat recipe! I didn't think they would set right, but 5 mins in the fridge did the trick.  I used half pb chips and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Yum!!:-) Love these! Hubby loved them too...said they tasted like an extra crunchy Crunch bar.:-)

Yummy and fast! I would reduce the cornflakes to 3 c. and make the crunches bite size. Put them in the fridge right away to set, and serve them cold. I didn't like them as much hot, but once we tried them right from the fridge, my husband and I were hooked.

Loved it!  Couldn't be simpler.  I followed the directions exactly, and instead of placing on waxed paper, I put them in mini muffin papers.  Topped each with a robin egg for Easte,r and they are too cute.  Will be making more for Easter day!

What is not to love about butterscotch, peanut butter and crunchiness? Fabulous and easy.

This is the recipe that one of my friend's moms used to make for us when she had a sleepover.  We lived in Arkansas at the time and these were always kept in the refrigerator for us to eat.

I used to make this same recipe years ago.  My sister found it and passed it along to the rest of us and we just loved it.  The original recipe called for chow mein noodles, but we have used most any type of dry cereal.  They all work great!  It is such an easy recipe and is always a hit!  Glad I found it again!

Wow! I'd forgotten how good these were. I used honey bunches of oats and it added interest. Instead of the messing cookie drop system, I dumped it all on a wax paper lined cookie sheet and flattened it down fairly even. I popped it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, then just broke it into pieces. It is rich, but that's exactly how we like it!

These taste exactly like you would expect.  If you like butterscotch, you will certainly like these.  Not incredible, but super easy to make and will satisfy a sweet tooth craving.

Great recipe!  Used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch and loved the taste!  Was afraid of burning the chocolate chips but the low heat works just fine.  Added more cornflakes than stated to use up all the sauce.    Dropped the crunches into tiny little paper cake cases and they set right up in fridge after 5 min.    The end result is salty and not too sweet, and I can still taste the crispy cornflakes.  Had me about 10 of those since this morning...

These are very, very rich but very delicious.  We made them with butterscotch chips, but I also put an extra 1/2 cup of cornflakes in.  I'm allergic to nuts, so we used the NoNuts Peabutter and according to my partner, you can't tell the difference!

I am using this in my christmas food gift boxes. I have had a recipe similar to this for a couple of years now. I do change it a little. I use 4-4 1/2 c of flakes and add chopped peanuts or what ever else I have. And I use two heaping teaspoons of peanut butter, I dont measure it and it comes out wonderful.Thanks

I prefer them with rice crispy cereal instead of the corn flakes. However, both are very yummy! I set them in the freezer and store them in the fridge....I like to eat them cold rather than room temp.

My little sister and I made this on our girls night, and we didn't waste any time making these into cookies, we ate them straight from the pan. I think next time we'll make them with oatmeal (to resemble cocoa quickies no bake cookie). But otherwise these were delish!

These were quick to make and tasted good too. I made mine a little bit bigger than the recipe called for. We found the butterscotch chips to be a little overpowering and a little too sweet so I think next time we'll try the recipe with some semi-sweet chocolate chips instead.

Pretty darn good, and couldnt' be any easier. I  had a cookie-making-party where my 12 year old neice made these. They look like they're not going to solidify, but if you wait a minute, they are just great!
