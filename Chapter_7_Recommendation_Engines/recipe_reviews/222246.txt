If you are looking for an easy and simple recipe that has good flavor, you may want to consider this recipe.  I made half of the recipe using one 9” cake pan that I lined with parchment paper.  Also, I used an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple which is slightly under what the recipe requires.  It probably would have been a little sweeter with 10 oz. of crushed pineapple but I liked that is wasn’t overly sweet.  Also, instead of making half the amount of frosting, I made a quarter of the amount which was plenty for the cake.   I also decided to omit the chopped nuts on the topping just for aesthetics.  Be sure to line the pan with parchment paper as you will probably have difficulty releasing the cake from the pan.

I absolutely love this recipe---it's a winner.  I've made it several times now and add about 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 t. of salt and 1  t. of vanilla to the cake batter.  This is my new favorite cake recipe.  Thanks so much for submitting!

This is a delicious, dense cake, and I loved it! I made a half version in a round 9" pan that I used cooking spray and parchment paper. The recipe called for a 320 oven temp which I've never seen. I set it at 350 but will definitely reduce it to 325 the next time because it was browning a little too early, and I had to take it out. I added a pinch of salt and did not use nuts at all. Just realized that I could have added coconut to the batter, but I forgot. I didn't matter though because when topping with the coconut, there's plenty of it. I followed Deb C's suggestion of using 1/4 of the frosting for one layer, and I still had some left, so that was a good call to cut back on it. Just what I needed...a taste of summer! Thanks Martha for the great recipe!
