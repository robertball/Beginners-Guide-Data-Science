White cake mix turns our better than this recipe. I only made the cake (no frosting), but the cake was not good. It raised in the oven, but sank as it cooled making it very dense. It tasted like bread dough. If you're not an expert baker and want a good white cake, make it from a mix or find another recipe.

Right now I have the cake in the oven. I am writing about the cake itself. The first half of the recipe was a little weird. The dough was so sticky and thick, it was like making bread(which I hate to do). Not as easy as I thought. Waiting for results. Will write review after I am finished with the cake.(Note added after cake was finished...... This cake was horrible. I have no idea why the other reviewers said it was good. It tasted like nothing and was very heavy. I make at least 10 different cakes a week and this is the worst so far. Be willing to try and throw away. I did!)

This recipe is the worst baking disaster I can ever recall - Seriously. I made it for a birthday dinner and was completely embarrassed at how awful it was.  Doughy and extremely dense, the cake was so bad, guests ate a few bites and politely said they were to full to eat any more! Don't make the same mistake I did and waste time and $$ on making this "blue ribbon" cake!

"Heavier than usual"?  The batter was like play-doh, making it difficult to work with; the flavor of the finished cake was bland; and the recipe was an overall disappointment.  If this is how the cake is meant to turn out, I would not encourage people to make excuses for it!  I was hopeful through the baking, but once it cooled I found no reason to frost it and present it as a birthday cake.

This cake was pretty good, but it tasted like it had too much flour. It was a little heavier than cake usually is.

Terrible! I had high hopes for this cake but it turned out dense and dry. It was bland and tasted like sweetend bisuit. I will not use this recipe again

I thought this recipe was absolutely simple and delicious!  I did not make the frosting, but it still tasted wonderful.  I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract, and it made a perfect blend of flavor between the vanilla.  I must add that it is a bit of a heavier cake that rises in the oven and then falls a bit.  I would still recommend it to anyone who loves white cakes.  Please rate the frosting, so I can see if I want to try it!  Thank You!

Followed the recipe to a "t" except for the use of almond extract.  The batter was not unlike some described as play doh or dense.  It was very nice to work with.  I made only half the recipe to try and it's in the oven now. Is raising perfectly.  Using whipped cream for the frosting.

This cake was very moist.  It was denser than most white cakes but was very good.  The frosting was excellent but I did have to add more confectioners sugar to thicken enough to be spreadable on the cake.  I refrigerated till serving time.

This cake didn;t come out of the pan well even when greased and was crumbly so very difficult to frost.  The taste was fine but it was hideously ugly!

I am an experienced baker and I would classify the finished result of this as a bread ( and a dense thick one) not a cake.

This is the white cake recipe I've been looking for--light and fluffy yet moist.

I made some adjustments because I kind of know what I like:  I added an extra egg white and a 1/4 tsp. of baking soda which maybe makes it a little lighter and "eggier".  Otherwise I followed the recipe almost to a "T".

It was a little strange to make, but the results were great. 
Nice cake when you don't want it fighting with the filling or icing flavors. 
I made it with a lemon curd filling with lemon icing. Excellent.

I found this recipe to taste more like muffins than cake. It was fun to make and my husband ( who does't like sweets) liked this recipe more than I did.

I love this cake I made it tonight, but instead of using orange zest and juice i swapped it out with a fresh grapefruit!! So yummy! I just wish the cake came out a bit fluffier and had some bounce back to it!

Found this recipe looking 4 white cake cud use Canola oil in. Followed Jessica F's advice,used 5 egg whites & baking soda. Made 2 layers, put on plates, did rasp. jello "pokecakes", then pressed 2 cps.fresh rasps. on bottom layer refrig- erated til set, then filled & iced w. Cool Whip/vanilla pudd/pie fill combo for hubby's birthday....EXCELLENT!! Wud suggest perhaps problems some ladies xperienced may hv been NOT taking enuf time folding in the egg whites. Took me good 5 mins. bcause of stiffness of batter.  Will use this often w. variations...THANK YOU 4 such an old-fashioned-tasting vanilla goodness recipe.
