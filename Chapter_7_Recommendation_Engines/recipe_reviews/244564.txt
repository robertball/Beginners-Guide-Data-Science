I really like this soup. At first it seemed a bit too watery and thought I needed some heavy cream or some sort of thickener. it thickened up a bit as soon as I transferred it back to the pan. I goofed again and chopped up the chilies in the beginning so I had to just roll with it. The soup was spicy, but my friends and I enjoyed the spice level. The lime really shined and definitely needed to top this soup off.

I made this recipe and I really loved it, is very easy to prepare the flavor of the crab is amazing, the combination of vegetable broth , tomatoes , serrano and bell peppers is just perfect, for me it wasn't  spicy since we eat a lot of peppers in our daily basis, I followed  the recipe exactly as it is and the soup came wonderfully delicious, this one is a keeper.

This soup is not for the faint of heart!  It is spicy and I did not even use the full 4 Serrano peppers;  I used 2 and I got plenty of heat from them even though I stripped the seeds and the membrane.  There is a reason why it calls for the lime, use it!

Yum! This is a great warming soup! I used seafood stock in place of chicken broth and added the juice of 1 lime to the stock. I also doubled the vegetables to add extra thickness. Delicious!
