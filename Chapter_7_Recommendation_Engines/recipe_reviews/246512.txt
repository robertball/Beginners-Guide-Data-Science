I love, love, love new ideas to use my waffle maker and this is one more keeper for it. The room temp leftovers make great sandwiches. Just a quick heads up, this doesn't work as nicely with gluten free puff pastry. It wasn't terrible, but you don't get that light, flaky texture as with the gluten containing cousin. Thank you for the wonderful idea!

Great !! Helped out IN a Big way. Cut and made 4 "pieces" for each person. Loaded the 1st layer with tomato slices, sliced avocado, drizzled garlic Aioli. Topped with another piece, on that layered smoked turkey breast, 2 pieces turkey bacon, smoked mozzarella. Put sandwich wrapped in parchment paper and put in microwave for 2 minutes, all melty and lovely. The boys went and bought more puff pastry and fixings. Thank You!!

Two of my favourite things together.  Why didn't I think of it?! Now my waffle maker is out all the time. I like them spread with a little Nutella. I also did one with Mozzarella in between; it came better than I expected though I should probably add some spices next time.

They were great and super easy (after trying the first one).  Didn't know what to expect.  Will make these often.

One word describes this way of making waffles .... Fantastic.  Definetly will make it again.  The other bonus is very little cleanup.

We loved this!  Cooked great in waffle iron.  Put cinnamon sugar on one for breakfast - it has just enough shortening in it naturally that didn't need to add anything else.  THEN we used two of the toasted squares as the "bread" for grilled cheese and it was even better!!

It's puff pastry shaped like a waffle, that's all.  Not as good as traditional waffles and way more expensive.  And puff pastry can be put to better use, such as in apple or cherry turnovers.

I could give this recipe ten stars plus. It is that good!! I did not even wait until the puff pastry was completely frozen... I used a minituare waffle maker that I got at Crate & Barrel, cut the pastry to fit ( in small circles), greased the machine well, cooked it until the light went off and a bit longer, since they were a bit pale. Voila! Delicious. I haven't tried to freeze them to eat latter on, but they were amazing. Thanks for sharing. Really cute and delicious.

Quick, easy & tasty. It can be expensive if doing for a lot of people though. We used blueberries to top our waffles with & a little blueberry syrup. The reason we didn't give it 5 stars is I felt the waffle left a buttery/greasy taste in my mouth, but that is what puff pastry is. They were very light which we liked, but harder to cut with a fork than regular waffles. Will make again, but probably only for special occasions.

Very good considering how quick and easy these are.  I admit being quite skeptical, as nothing I've tried matches my mom's recipe.  However, they are terrific, though different!  We loved them for today's Father's Day breakfast with fresh strawberries, real maple syrup and a bit of whipped cream.  We thought mom would admit it was very clever.  Thank you for a super idea.
