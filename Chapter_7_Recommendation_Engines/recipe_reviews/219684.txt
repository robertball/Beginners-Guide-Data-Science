BB, I had a Funfetti cake mix that I could NOT figure out what to do with, plus the pressure of needing a dessert for Christmas dinner? THANK YOU! This is perfect! I added a small box of vanilla pudding and  for the glaze, I used 1 cup of Hot Buttered Rum batter along with the rum and Boy Oh Boy was this YUMMY! I have left over batter, so for dessert after dinner, guess what I'm gonna do??  I even ate a piece with my morning coffee of Course! LOL This cake could not be more simple but not simple tasting by any means. Terrific flavor! MERRY CHRISTMAS BB:)
