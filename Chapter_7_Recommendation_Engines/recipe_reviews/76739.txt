I had excellent results the very first time trying this recipe, thanks to the comments below it. They helped me troubleshoot the recipe. The directions are a little vague, and if they are followed as written, you will not end up with tasty buns, haha. 

What I did was mix the first five ingredients together in a pyrex measuring cup, then microwave them until the liquid temperature hit about 115-120 degrees (yeast needs warmth in order to become active). Then I added the yeast, and stirred well. It took about 8 minutes for the yeast to get bubbly, and then I mixed in the salt. 

After that I poured it all into a big mixing bowl and added the flour. Then I beat it well with a wooden spoon for about two minutes until the dough started to become stretchy and less sticky. Flouring my counter well, I turned the whole mass out of the bowl and just very lightly kneaded it three or four times, then rolled the dough into a big rope. I cut it into equal pieces, rolled those into balls, and set them on a greased baking sheet to rise in my warm kitchen. 

They DO INDEED RISE IN 20MINS! It was amazing, really. Next time I will actually make them a bit smaller because holy cow do they poof up! We had big huge bakery-style buns and they were awesome.

Yes, PSHELLY, the temperature of the water could mess up the recipe. Yeast activates at a fairly specific range of temperatures. Have a look at the yeast packet for details. Actually this recipe's directions aren't very good as far as preparing the yeast for the most success. I'd advise heating the milk, margarine, water and sugar to the recommended temperature on the yeast packet (somewhere between 115F and 130F depending on if it is regular or rapid rise)and then mix in the yeast and let it stand for 5 minutes. If it doesn't foam and bubble after 5 minutes, your yeast isn't good.

Many are saying you need to heat the water for the recipe to activate the yeast, well that is true if you are using active yeast, but not for instant yeast, which is what is called for in the recipe. Instant yeast does not require warm water or proofing.

Great recipe in my opinion.  Contrary to the other reviews, my bun raised just fine.  Yes, it did take about an hour and a half, but all my bread takes that long.  Fast, easy, few ingredients, no kneading, what more do you want in a recipe?  I put mine in the oven (turned off) with a big bowl of HOT water under the rack.  Makes all of my bread raise nicely.  I make big burgers with LOTS of conciments, so these buns were perfect, nice and dense.  I halved the recipe and made 8 large buns.  Warming the milk helps, and to get 25 buns out of the full recipe I would think they would have to be pretty small.  I liked this recipe a lot.  As I said, my buns raised nicely.

These rolls were so bad they prompted me to join AllRecipes so I could write a review. I followed instructions exactly and doubted the rolls would rise in just 20 minutes. I did use instant yeast. They didn't rise any, but I went ahead and baked them. They were heavy and tasted strongly of yeast. We couldn't eat them. I also only got 9 hamburger-sized rolls out of the recipe.

These were great!  I don't like to buy bread, but love to make my own--it just tastes better.  I took suggestions from several others and used 2 cups whole wheat flour and the rest bread flour.  I did not have a problem with them rising, but it may have been because I let the dough rise first until doubled, and then formed the rolls and let them rise until they looked good (didn't time either rise).  I also used reconstituted dry milk instead of the stuff from the jug.  I brushed the rolls with egg and sprinkled on sesame seeds before baking--delicious!!

The taste and texture of these buns are perfect! I didnt alter any of the ingredients, though I did let the buns rise for about 2 hours (in the oven with a bowl of hot water underneath...this is the perfect rising method!) and I divided the dough into 8 balls instead of 25. Really a very good bun.

This recipe is a pretty basic white bread mix, one I've made before.  Very easy to make and the buns were great; since it's a basic recipe, you can add any herbs or seeds you'd like.  Also, let the dough rise for 2 hours, not 20 minutes; 20 min just isn't enough.

Definitely delicious.  The recipe should have said to warm the milk so the yeast would become active.  I know that but an inexperienced cook would have been befuddled when their dough did not rise.  I also let mine rise longer.  My picky husband even liked these.  I had fun making them.

These are so delicious and easy to make I cannot justifying buying hamburger buns again!  My hamburgers tasted extra special.  For an added kick, I've mixed in some light golden onions to the batter and dried onions  and garlic to the top.  I think I am in heaven!  Thank you!

I would like to apologize for those who can't help but be rude. I see nothing wrong with this recipe. If others are not getting good results from this recipe it might be because of altitude (yeast rising) also room temp. I would also like to add that if I'm in a good mood my food shows it. If I'm in a bad mood my food is not too good.    My self I love to cook anything home made and thank you for sharing your recipe.    Lee Hay

I scaled the recipe to 12 servings, followed it exactly as written and had excellent results.  These rolls are so incredibly easy to make, and with one short 20-minute rise, FAST!  I did use an egg wash and topped them with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and dried onion.  I followed the recommendation of a reviewer and made eight instead of 12 which yielded good-sized buns.  The texture is light and fluffy, but most importantly, they taste fantastic!  This is now my go-to recipe for hamburger buns and is going into my Favorites folder. Thanks CHEERON883 for sharing because IMO this is 5-star all the way.  UPDATE 8.19.12  Made half a recipe and ended up with four decent-sized hamburger buns and 6 slider buns.  Tasty, as usual.  ***UPDATE 10.7.13   Half recipe weighs 24 oz which will give you 12 slider buns @ 2 oz each.

*** UPDATED 04/22/09 - I see this recipe has now been edited to say warm milk and more working the dough.  Perhaps AR adapted the recipe as it was submitted. ***  This only gets three stars since the original recipe, IMO, just would not work.  No wonder many are saying their buns are like biscuits.  You can't have a great yeast bread product with no yeast formation (if you use cold milk), no kneading and no long-term raising (twice).  It's a yeast bread recipe trying to be a quick bread recipe.  All my comments are based on a halved recipe.  I made this in my bread machine, but used warm milk and room temp butter.  I also added 2 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten for texture and wheat germ and flax meal for nutrition.  The recipe called for 3 cups of flour (half size), but I had to add at least another cup to get the desired dough.  The machine mixed, kneaded (30 minutes), and rose the bread once.  Then I removed it from the machine, punched it down, let it rest a bit, and then formed the buns and brushed them with milk and then seasoned with granulated garlic and dehydrated, minced onion.  I let them raise another 30 minutes until it was apparent they wouldn't raise any higher.  I should have had 13 buns, but I had 18.  Next time I do this, I will make them larger.  I served them with "Jeff's Sloppy Joes" from All Recipes.  My husband LOVED it!  We ate the leftover buns/rolls with manicotti the following evening.

These buns were pretty good, but not brilliant. They rose alright (I used fresh yeast and heated the milk to the right temperature), but I think I might have added too much flour as they came out very dry. I thought the dough needed more flour as it was (in my opinion) too sticky to knead or roll into balls. But maybe I was wrong.. I got 24 buns out of this recipe, but they were very small (despite rising), some too small to use for a normal-sized burger. After the rising, I brushed them with egg and sprinkled sesame seeds and brown flax seeds on top, which was a nice detail. I will make them again, and see if they turn out better.

I used this recipe to make mini hamburgers for a friend's baby shower, and was very pleased with the results. (I made a half-batch of the recipe.) I heated the first four ingredients in a saucepan until warm, but not so warm that it was uncomfortable to submerge a (clean!) finger. I also substituted butter for margarine, because that's what I had on hand.  I moved the mixture to a medium mixing bowl, stirred in the salt, and sprinkled a couple of teaspoons of instant yeast over the top. As previous posters have noted, instant yeast does not require proofing, but I did wait a little while (while prepping some other toppings for the burgers) to see it start to act. Once it did, I proceeded as written until it came time to shape the dough.  I made a dough tube, then sliced it into pieces that had about an inch to an inch and a half diameter and were an inch wide. This made over three dozen buns, possibly closer to four dozen. I let those rise, then they baked for 10-15 minutes, until they were lightly brown on top. They rose out more than they rose up, which ended up being perfect for my purposes, but may pose a challenge for larger buns. The resulting buns were light, had plenty of air, but also held up remarkably well to condiments and toppings. I am about to make them again for the second time in two days. Thanks!

I read the reviews first to see how other people coped with any problems. I halved the recipe and used my bread machine. I warmed the milk and made sure my butter was at room temp. I Placed the ingredients in minus the water and set my machine on the dough setting. I needed to add about an ounce of water while it mixed. After mixing I let the dough rest for about 10 min. and then proceded to make 8 buns. I didn't make round balls, I make them more like the shape of a bun trying not to stretch the dough too much. I let them rise for about 30 min. and popped them in my oven at 375. for about 20 min. They were light and fluffy. My husband put butter and jam on once of them and now he can't wait to BBQ tonight!! This one is a keeper!!  Thanks

This recipe is great. I made it first with all-purpose flour as in the original recipe. Next I used half white bread flour & half whole wheat flour. Here's my method for making it in my Cook's Essentials Bread Machine (I suppose it would be the same for most others):  Instead of milk, put about 1 3/4 c cold water in measuring cup & heat in the microwave about 1 min. (Current wisdom says not to use water from the water heater internally.)  Add about 1/4-1/2 c dry milk solids & cold water. (Adjust these to taste to make a total of 2 c liquid.)  Pour this into bread machine pan. Put 1/4 c water & 1/4 c margarine into the same measuring cup.  Heat this in the microwave until the oleo melts & add it to the liquid in the pan.  Add the 1/4 c white sugar, a scant 2 t salt & 3 cups bread (or all-purpose) flour & 3 cups whole wheat flour.  Put the bread machine pan into the bread machine, make a little well in the middle of the flour & add 3 teaspoons of dry machine yeast, being careful not to let the yeast touch the water before starting the machine.  Set the machine for dough and walk away.    When the dough has finished rising, take it out & pull pieces out*, shape into balls, & place onto jelly-roll pans or cookie sheets.  Let rest a few minutes & flatten to about 1/2" thickness.  Let rise 20 min., bake 15 min. near the top of oven (the bottoms burn in my oven if I put them lower) and voila!  Delicious & beautiful hamburger buns!!  *5oz pieces yielded 12 large buns.

I can't buy hamburger buns in our town and have been looking for a recipe that produces light buns -- this is it!  Nothing heavy about these.  I even used 2 cups whole wheat flour intead of white and they still came out light.  I heated the milk and let them raise for an hour.

This is a great recipe but it does better if you warm your milk - and if you aren't using rapid rise yeast, you better let it rise for a couple of hours with a wet, warm towel over it away from a breeze.  :)

These were great and my family really did think they were gourmet!  I did, however, warm the milk in the microwave to about 110 degrees before adding the yeast and the rest of the ingredients. Next time I might brush the tops of the dough with egg whites and sprinkle sesame seeds. Now that I have made these, I don't think I could go back to regular, store bought buns.

Super easy and tasty! I used rice milk because of dairy allergies around here and it worked just fine. I found coating my hands with olive oil helped shape the dough without excess stickiness.

delicious! I split the recipe in half and made 8 large buns. I also only had regular active yeast so i let it double then made them into balls then let those rise until they were the size i wanted. i also brushed with egg wash and they came out golden and shiny!! I used these with my crockpot bbq pulled chicken topped with some homemade coleslaw. HEAVEN

Amazing! You don't have to heat your milk/water/butter/sugar up very much to activate the yeast, although if you're worried about the freshness of your yeast be safe and proof according to directions. When it comes to kneading, you don't really have to work hard. Just knead it lightly until it is homogeneous, then press into a square, fold as you would a letter, then fold again the same way and flip it over, seam down. You can let it rise and do this again, but not necessary. I cut this in half and made 4 hoagie rolls with it. Brilliant!

This is a great recipe...however unless you want the buns to taste and feel like biscuits, you need to let the dough double in size before forming them into buns.  I waited  about 2 hours.  I made mini buns and they were fabulous!!  Thanks!

Surprisingly light for homemade buns. I usually end up with a denser result but was pleasantly surprised with these. I substituted bread flour and used fewer than 6 cups because of the higher protein content (i.e. it absorbs more water). I rolled out the dough after letting it rise a bit and used a large circular lid to cut out my buns. They came out very tasty!

Fabulous!!!....Very easy...very tasty..I used this recipe for every thing from hamburger buns to deep fried Italian Hot Dogs!...The only downfall of the recipe is that my family no longer enjoys store bought buns when I'm trying to make a simple hamburger dinner!!

These are amazing! Great for sandwich rolls, or even just dinner rolls (sometimes I brush with minced garlic and melted butter to serve with Italian dishes). Recipe doesn't make 25 as stated, though. It yields about 15 rolls sized suitable for hamburgers or sandwiches.

this was really easy since I used the instant yeast, the one thing that I did that wasn't mentioned was, just b/4 I let it rise the first time I put a piece of saran wrap on my scale and weighed my dough, I then converted it all over to ounces and then divided by 25 and came out with .38 ounces just so all my buns were the same size. which is something that you're looking for when preparing food. the one thing that I did try was putting sesame seeds on the tops of my buns but the little devils didn't stay on. So I will try something different next time when I make these, which will be in about 3 weeks when I have the first summer kick off of the bbq season and will be doing a pork shoulder and I will need about 4 dozed of these lovely beauties

These are so easy to make and taste great.  I omitted the 1/4 cup water because I don't usually proof yeast and I used Red Star Active Dry because that's what I have on hand.  The only thing I might change it to use less salt.  I weighed the dough into 4 ounce portions and got ten 4" buns. I'll make them again but I'll add about 1 cup of whole wheat flour for a little more flavor.

Not to self and others: Do not flatten the dough balls too much or else the buns expand out rather than up. Also, when scaling down, make 12 servings for 8 buns for larger burger patties.

I made these EXACTLY as written and they turned out fantastic - but I think they could have used more liquid or less flour because they were a bit hard and didn't rise like the wonderful pictures others posted.  Will definitely make again and adjust accordingly.  :)

It was like biting into a sweet roll.  Why would you use so much sugar?  Way too yeasty tasting and mine did not raise as indicated and I had no oven spring to help out either.  I'm a professional chef and I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.  Sorry.

I have always wanted to make my own buns, but I always waited until too late to get them going. These seemed easy & were ready very quickly. I made 2 batches with sesame seeds on top.  In fact, I went to get my camera, when I returned they were mostly gone. Not enough for a Photo, anyway. They were a huge hit, I got credit for doing something spectacular, I didn't say how simple it really was.  I am a master Baker, I always expect a good recipe to be difficult or at least a little time consuming... not.  It was perfect.

These were very good.  I scaled back the recipe to make 8 and brushed the tops with olive oil and sesame seeds before baking.  The only thing I did different was used dried active yeast which meant I let the do rise in a warm oven for 30 minutes before shaping into 8 buns.  I let them rise for another 15 minutes in a warm oven before baking.  I will definitely make these again.

Recipe didn't need any modification at all, it came out to about 18 buns instead (about 0.3oz per dough) - yes, i measured my dough before shaping!  also used 3 cups of bread flour and WW flour for the rest.

Didn't rise enough even with lots of extra time.  Would make a better dinner roll than a hamburger bun  because it has a good taste to it, just too dense for a hamburger.

These are the best buns I have ever made and really fast.  I made 75 buns for a church supper in one morning.  They only raise one time.  The secret is the right temperature of the water.  If you don't have it right use a thermometer. I will use this recipe again and again.

Made these for sloppy joes.  I added 1/2 cup flour to go from batter to dough and let the mass have a first rise of 45 minutes, followed by the divide/2nd rise.  Forming them, I used a 3/4 c. measuring cup to "cut" off a piece of dough, rolled them, then flattened them out a bit onto a greased baking sheet.  Bake the bigger rolls for 18 minutes, but they were PERFECT for our sloppy joes and hamburgers.  It's filed in my recipe box. (I got 16 pcs)

The texture was just like I bought them at the store and the fact they were "home made" made these buns extra special.  I made these into hot dog buns.  15 minutes was a wee bit too long in my particular oven, and maybe it was because I made them hot dog shaped, so I will reduce the time next I make this recipe.  Be careful!  Yes, I will make these again.  Thanks!

Being that there are only two of us, I halved the recipe. Some of you must have super-yeast because my buns took about 45 minutes to rise. I also heated the milk, butter, water, sugar, and salt to about 115 before adding the yeast. If you follow the reviews, you should have no problem.

If you're going to tell people how to make something, you should know how to make it first.  I have never made bread that was ready in less than an hour, but I thought I'd try it anyway.  They were awful... I have seen many great recipes, but this shames them all.  It didn't even say they needed to double in size, just rise for 20 min.  Don't try this one, Tasty Buns is great.  Doesn't make as many, but much better.

Great!  I tried something a little different using this as my base recipe.  Intead of milk I added 2 cups of warm tomato juice.  As well I added 1 Tbsp of dried minced onion and 2 tsp of greek seasoning but italian would work also.  They turned out great although I only got 12 buns and it took 20 minutes to bake.

I just made these yesterday and we LOVED them!! I made them with Mom's Big Burgers (another winner!) and I WILL be making these again!! Thanks for the easy recipe. I did let them rise a bit longer than 20 minutes. We live in Colorado so I definately suggest letting the dough rise until your desired size. Next time I may make them bigger in size too!! But other than that don't change a thing! Love them!!

Split the recipe in half and do the dough in an automatic bread machine.  The abm does the initial rise and punchdown, then do the 20 minute final rise.  It comes out kinda dense, but okay

This recipe was alright.  All the same I don't see what the fuss was about.  I didn't find the buns extra specail, or anything.  But they were decent.  However, at least in my case, they didn't rise a great deal, after 2 hours even.  I more had ... buns.  I was hoping for large buns, or larger anyway.  Something larger then a dinner role.  Probably won't try this one again.  But it has worked for some, just not for me!  Thanks anyway.

I wanted some buns for our sloppy joes! They came out just right! My family like them plain as well. The third time, I added vanilla and cinnamon for a breakfast item!

I was out of buns, found this recipe and my kids ate their whole meal!  Easy and quick to make on a sunny day when dinner is behind schedule.     I only made 1/2 the recipe!  My buns looked just like the picture! I put my yeast in with the warm water before I mixed it with the milk.  Helps with activation!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but am curious why all the reviews address warming the milk and water.  The recipe clearly instructs you to use warm milk (110 degrees) and warm water.  It also says to mix the first 5 ingredients and let stand for 5 minutes which is plenty of time to proof the yeast.

I used regular yeast and warm ingredients, followed the recipe as is with the 20 minute rise and they turned out great!  I needed them fast and it took less than an hour start to finish. Update: this time I added a few tablespoons of dried minced onion and painted garlic butter on top then pressed in sesame seeds. Never had a problem,fast and good.

These are awesome!!! I will never buy hamburger/hotdog buns again!! I think the problem other reviewers are having result from not reading the ingredients properly. I did what another reviewer suggested and mixed the first four ingredients (w/ cold milk and water) and zapped it in the microwave until it reached 115 degrees (two minutes and then one minute) before adding the yeast. I also used active yeast instead of instant and it did take a little longer to rise, but I expected this. I just need to work on sizing because because they came out huge!! But they are soft and tasty and so perfectly golden brown!! My new go-to bun recipe. These could even be eaten as rolls! So good!

This is a super-delicious, very reliable recipe.  I've made it 2-3 times per week since I first tried it 6 months ago, because my family absolutely loves these buns.  I form the dough into kaiser-sized buns and we use them for all of our sandwiches and burger buns.  I also make smaller dinner rolls and long, skinny bread sticks, and also hot-dog style buns.  I also use the recipe for pizza dough by subbing water for the milk and olive oil for the butter.  But our favorite way to eat these is exactly as the recipe states, and I've never had a bad batch.  Seriously!  It's one of my favorite recipes from allrecipes.com

If you are familiar and comfortable in working with yeast, this definitely is a keeper.  Offering itself to variety when desired.  The only change I made with this recipe, was to use an 1/8 of a cup of water & 1/8 of a cup of veg. oil, but that was a personal preference of how I like my breads, adding some veg. oil.  But adding spices would be a great option too..

Recipe is fine but following directions led to buns appropriate for White Castle burgers. I purposely made about half the number and they still came out small. I can't imagine making 25 buns.

Sorry, but as a baker I didn't give these much hope, but tried them anyway - just as written.  There is a reason for a knead, and a reason you don't use margarine!  These are burger buns, not candy bars... what's up with all that sugar?  And two packages of yeast?  I figured it was the sugar and salt covering up the taste of the yeast.  These were just not good, very heavy and doughy.  Wanted to give a better rating, but if you're a bread baker you'll probably already guess that these won't be very good.  My quest for the perfect bun continues.

I love this recipe. The rolls came out great. I did let them rise for over an hour though. I would recommend waiting for your yeast mixture to dissolve all the way and start to bubble. Great taste though, a little dense.

These are great and easy too!  As a stand alone roll recipe, they aren't the best but as they are intended to be eaten (a hamburger bun) they are great!  Nice and doughy, good dense texture, and a perfect accompaniment as they don't overpower the hamburger.  I halved the recipe and made 6 good sized buns.  They rose perfectly (though I did let them rise longer than 20 mins).  I also subbed half whole wheat flour and half bread flour for the AP flour.  A winner . . . quick, easy, tasty!  Definitely better than store bought for a fraction of the price!  We eat veggie burgers periodically for a convenient meal and they are not my favorite but these buns made me actually crave a veggie burger-thanks so much!

I've made this so many times and they've been PERFECT everytime, even when I didn't weigh properly and even once I made them drunk and forgot to warm the milk and melt the butter (I use instant yeast) Was my first time working with yeast too. So I dunno what the people who said this is a bad recipe did for it to fail but I find it fool proof. It's changed the way I eat, now I make all my own bread

Dough needs more than 20 minutes to rise.  Recipe yield makes 'slider' size buns.  Not at all a bun for hamburgers.  I'll keep looking for a good homemade hamburger bun recipe...this isn't it, at all.

Best bun recipe. I used my breadmachine to mix the dough and as soon as the mixing was done, took it out and divided into 24 balls and placed them on 15 X10 baking sheet so that the edges are slightly touching. I needed it like that for some other Indian recipe.Rose perfectly and baked beautifully. I brushed with milk before baking and brushed with melted butter once they came out of the oven. I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks.

I've made this 3 times now. 
I am making miniature hamburgers for my daughter's "Culture Day" at school here in Costa Rica and this is our entry for American food.  This recipe makes about 55 50 cent size rolls.
 The first 2 times I let the dough rise for one hour after kneeding and before forming but it produced a rather dense result.
Tonight i followed the recipe exactly and it made the perfect bun.

I used whole wheat flour for a third of the total flour.  I let the rolls rise for about an hour, then baked.  They turned out okay-- the flavor was fine, and the texture wasn't bad-- but definitely not what I'd call a "hamburger" bun.  They are much heavier than that.  That said, I can't wait to try them for tuna salad sandwiches or the like.

These were hard and dry.  I even warmed the milk and let the yeast bubble and it still took 2 hours to double in size.  I should have used a cup less flour and maybe they wouldn't be so dense.  I gave 2 stars because the taste was still good.  These rolls would go great with  a spaghetti dinner.

My family loved these hamburger buns. I used a bread maker instead of the traditional method. The only changes made to the original recipe were to decrease the amount of flour by 1/2 cup and I brushed melted butter on rolls before baking. I made 16 huge rolls instead of 25. They stayed soft for days. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you.

Sorry, but I tried these TWICE and both times they came out totally flat and hard as a rock! (The first time I didn't warm the milk though.) The second time I warmed the milk, but it might have been too hot (could that mess it up?) I let them rise for twice as long and still no luck. I might try it again though...

this were good and easy to make - though I did have to add quite a bit more flour b/c my dough was way too sticky (i live in a humid climate) -- i'd say the buns turned out more like biscuits like some other reviewers said -- but they were still very good - i like it with strawberry jam - ooh so good - maybe some sesame seeds on top will convince me more that it's a hamburger bun

Help, 4th of July and no hotdog buns! Check-out cookbooks, no good, ahh, the internet! Never before had been to ALLRECIPES, ended up with this recipe and with a few conversions had wonderful hotdog buns without any fuss! But, then I am also an excellent baker, made 6 hotdog buns and 12 sweetrolls for the 5th breakfast!

They came out too soft for me-- they actually started to fall apart when I tried to cut them in half and put a burger in them.  Otherwise it was very easy and fool-proof recipe.  Tasted darned good too

My daughter and I tried this one to make mini cheeseburgers...so we made the buns smaller.  I'm not sure what went wrong but they turned out pretty dense and hard (maybe too small?).  Reading some of the other reviews I'm thinking maybe I should have let them rise more too.  I liked them personally and think how they turned out would be good for a bread bowl.  My husband and daughter didn't like them though.  Oh well...I think I'll try them again and tweak a few things and then I'll let you know.  lol

These are excellent buns!  Halved the recipe and used fat-free, lactose-free milk (a must for my husband), and 1 C of whole wheat flour.  They were delicious - even when I accidentally baked the first panful at 400 (forgot to turn oven down when I put rolls in).  I got 6 very large buns and 4 average size buns out of the halved recipe.  Great with our burgers.  I split, buttered, and  toasted one of the very large ones for breakfast this morning.  Wonderful!  Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The buns were OK but I only got 13 buns and they didn't rise at all in 20 mins. When I finally did bake them they were heavy. I think I would try the recipe again but make the rolls a bit bigger and let them rise longer.

Good recipe.  I halved it and it worked great. I found that nearly two hours were necessary for raising.  These are more substantial and hold up better to juicy burgers than purchased buns.  They're worth the time and effort

I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added 2 eggs. They did rise in 20 minutes, but it took 12 minutes to bake. After removal from the oven, I brushed the tops with melted butter, for a beautiful brown color!!

These were great.  I followed the recipe exactly except for halving it.  My yield was not nearly 12 buns - I think I got more like 8, and the ones I got were smallish - not big burger buns.  Making 12 from a 1/2 recipe would have yielded buns that were dinner roll size.  Still, they were delicious and I will make them again.

This recipe ROCKS!!! This is the first time I've tried to make hamburger buns. I had to heat up the milk/butter/water/sugar mixture in the microwave to get it to the right temp.  It took about 2 minutes to get it to the right temp. The yeast bubbled right up in the 5 minutes, once it was mixed in to the milk mixture. I like my hamburger buns big, so I made my initial dough balls bigger and baked 6 to a cookie sheet. I probably could have done 8, but they wouldn't have turned out as nice. I did brush with butter when they came out of the oven, just to give the crusts a shine. I'll be using this recipe from now on.

These turned out AMAZING!!!   I did let my dough rise, and then let the rolls rise for longer........was raised up that way by my Grams!  It doesn't feel right otherwise!   They are so fluffy and yummy!   Thanks for all the tips and hints everyone!

Good flavor and really easy to make. I let mine rise for longer than 20 minutes.  I let them sit in a warm (turned off) oven for about an hour.  I also used active dry yeast in place of instant.  The conversion is 1 1/4 tsp active dry per tsp of instant.

I find that if I use the full 6 cups of flour the rolls are not as light but if I use 1/2 less the dough is very sticky. I found this easy and I am an just learning how to make home bread properly.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I wonder if the type of flour makes a difference and I use Rapid yeast in the jar.  I also only make 12-13 because we like large buns and I also flatten them down because the rolls left in shape of ball were too high and too small.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it makes fantastic dinner rolls! Just not what I wanted in a hamburger bun. Like other reviewers, I recommend heating the milk, water and butter together before adding to the yeast and sugar. For those who've never worked with yeast, the 5 minutes standing time is for proofing the yeast to make sure it's alive. Sometimes it takes longer than 5 minutes, so give it up to 10 minutes to get foamy before you start over with new ingredients. "Foamy" means that the liquids have expanded, but it doesn't always look like what I'd call "foamy." Make sure you take a good look at your mixture before setting it to stand, so you will know if it has expanded and that your yeast is good.

simple and easy.  I put grilled onions on top.  I did use regular yeast but it didn't take long.  Will definitely make again.  I like the idea of making these soup bowls.

For such a quick recipe, these are not bad.  The batch I made were really 3 star buns, but I made lots of substitutions, so it wasn't a good test of the recipe.  I was baffled by many previous comments about heating the milk.  I've never heated liquid when using instant yeast (though it should be at  room temp.)  I subbed soy milk for the milk and olive oil for the butter, and still enjoyed the buns.  I made only 12, but they rose well (in 20 minutes) and I ended up with 12 good size, rather dense, but tasty buns.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, yum!  I made these tonight; I wanted to use up some leftover eggplant parmesan, so I thought I'd serve subs.  I halved the recipe (just three of us) and shaped them into mini-sub rolls.  I warmed the milk/water/sugar/butter mixture and used active yeast; placed them in a warm oven to raise for 20 minutes as directed.  These buns were fast, delicious, and made the leftovers extra-special.  I will be making these again and again!

Didn't get as many as recipe mentioned, but will be making again & bigger yet.  I don't know why they didn't spread & shape better, but even if I only get a dozen out of a full recipe that is ok.  Very easy to make.  Dough was very sticky, so may have to add more flour than calls for.

You haven't had a sandwich or a burger until you've tried it on a homemade bun!  The kneading was hard for me due to health/physical issues, so I cut the recipe in half and use my breadmaker for the kneading and first rise.  I put the milk, yeast, and salt in the bread maker, let it sit for a few minutes (until foamy), then add all the other ingredients and push start.  After the first rise, I punch it down, form my buns, let them rise then bake.  I often add about 1/4 C. of nutritional yeast for nutritional purposes and they come out fantastic.  Also, I'm at a low elevation/high humidity and must bake for less then 20 min (more like 15).  So good my Pappa eats them plain like a dinner roll!

5 stars WITH the changes suggested by other reviewers.  My family loved these.  Perfect texture and taste.  Changes:  Halved the recipe to make 8 buns, replaced margarine with butter and put it all in my bread maker on dough cycle.  (1.5 hours) Then I shaped the dough into balls and let them rise for a few more minutes before baking.  My family doesn't want any other buns from now on and came up with a long list of other uses for these.

These were great if you're looking for a hamburger bun that is more like a roll - like to be used in a White-Castle type burger.

I found them to be a bit too heavy for ordinary hamburgers, so for that I used a light white bread recipe.

These were Great!  My husband said the burgers were the best he ever had, and that the bun made all the difference.  I used active dry yeast instead of instant because it's all I head.  I let them rise for 35 minutes.  They were perfect.  I did press the dough balls flat onto the baking sheet to get a wider base.  Proofing the yeast is just for peace of mind.  Even with active dry yeast, if it's good it will work without proofing.  It will rise faster if you do proof though.  The dough was a little heavier than I thought it would be, and I think next time I'll go just shy of 6 cups for a fluffier finish.  Thanks Cheer!

I found little slider patties, so I needed custom-sized buns. I followed the suggestions by faeriecat and the buns rose just fine in 20 minutes. I couldn't believe my luck, finding a bread recipe that takes less than an hour. I halved the recipe and got 16 slider buns out of it.

These buns are quite tasty by themselves, especially fresh out of the oven, and would make great dinner rolls, and all in less than an hour!

These are so much better than store bought buns! I did not have any white sugar (I only use Splenda and that doesn't make the yeast rise) so I used brown sugar in its place. Thanks for the recipe! I will make these again!

This is a stand by for us.  Particulary good when toasted on the grill.  I use real butter instead of margerine and shape the buns a little larger - otherwise I use the recipe as written.

Taste was great, used a little less sugar as another poster mentioned.  I sprinkled some finely shredded cheddar on top of a few to see how that worked; worked just fine.  The shaping of the dough was as refined as the photo, but I'll definitely make these again.

Much better bread recipe than other ones on this site.  The rolls were big enough for 'sliders' so I'll make them bigger the next time.  I let the dough rise for 20 mins then I kneaded and let rise for a few more mins before cutting into rolls.  Easy and good.

These turned out great!  But deffinatly don't think you are going to get 24 buns out of this dough!  We made 12 buns and were perfect for our hamburgers!  Put some egg wash on the top and some sesseme seeds before baking and it was yum!

I don't think I added enought salt. Otherwise they had a nice flavor. My family was impressed that I had made these from scratch instead of buying buns. Things are so tight right now everywhere we are trying to keep expenses down so this is a good alternative to buying commercial bread.

These were very delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and made four large buns to fit the hamburgers.  I found the recipe yielding 25 buns to be a little over exaggeration.  I also turned the heat up to 400*F to make the outside a little more crisp.

good recipe, but need a very wide cutter (dessert bowl or wide mouthed jar) to get them wide enough for hamburgers. I had trouble with them coming out more like dinner roll size until the 2nd or 3rd time making them.

Perhaps it's because I live at 5,280 feet in Denver, CO, but I've tried these TWICE and both times, they failed to rise.  They make dinner rolls, not hamburger buns.  I've tried to adjust the recipe for my elevation, but they still just sit there.

I enjoyed the ease of these buns and it is an easily adjustable recipe which is great. I cut the recipe in half used about 3/4 pre-baked acorn squash (which had some butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on it), used brown sugar instead of white, and used 4 cups of 100% whole wheat. I did follow advice of others and let rise for about two hours. Dense but moist and fluffy as well.

Couldn't rate this recipe 5 stars because I haven't made them yet....but I'm going to. Except instead of hamburger buns, I'm going to try making hotdog buns. And, here's a 'trick' I learned a long time ago to get things to raise evenly: brush the tops w/melted butter or egg wash and set the pan on a heating pad set on 'low'. Don't cover. PRESTO!

This recipes was great! I especially loved the slightly sweet flavor. The key to this recipe is understanding how to use yeast.   Make sure that the liquids you are adding the yeast to are warm. Let stand for 5 minutes- the yeast should have bubbled/left a foam on top of the liquid. If not- start over.   After you form the rolls, cover them with a towel and put in a warm oven to rise. Don't just leave it uncovered on the counter, it will take forever to rise.

Rolls came out way too dense for hamburger buns. They were good with pot roast where there was lots of gravy to sop up.

These were SO EASY to make, and they turned out wonderful!   I did use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, which made these very dense and Super Filling!   I also followed the suggestion of someone else to roll the dough into a "rope" and cut into appropriate pieces.  I don't see how you could get 25 buns out of this recipe- I made 12 and ended up with 3-4 larger ones, and the rest were much smaller.  My dough did not rise too much, though so maybe that's why?  I think next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I will add some honey and try the oven rising method others mentioned.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I halved the recipe and made 12 buns but I think the results would have been better making 8.  They are delicious and easy to make.  Time permitting, I will probably make these instead of purchasing hamburger buns in the future.

This is my first bread making attempt. I love this recipe! It was quick, and since I only needed 6 hamburger buns, I divided the leftover dough and made 2 mini loafs of bread (perfect for the kids breakfast with jam).  I just warmed the milk in the microwave first and let the rolls rise in my oven for about 20 minutes. (I preheated the oven to 150, then turned it off once it was at the temp). I put them in, so there wouldn't be any drafts and it was nice and warm.  They turned out great! I'll definitely make this again!

Easy, great recipe!  I followed the directions pretty closely, except I made a half batch and ended up with 12  buns that were a bit on the small side.  I also substituted some whole wheat flour  to make them a bit more healthy.  I think this time I did 2 cups  all-purpose and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Next time I'll do a 1:1 mixture.  Great buns!

These were great!  Followed the recipe exactly and impressed everyone!  I may try using part whole wheat or rye later, and I'm also considering reshaping them another time to make hot dog buns!

These were so simple to make and they taste really good.  Plus, the texture is just great.  We usually add seasame seeds at my house, and I doubt we will ever need to buy buns again!

As per the other comments, I heated the milk and water together before adding the yeast, and I was surprised and how well and quickly the buns rose in twenty minutes. After they came out of the oven, I threw them on the grill with the burgers and the result was great. Anyone who didn't like this recipe should have heated the wet ingredients or used fresher yeast!

Used tips posted by others, heat milk, etc.  Made soft yummy buns, but they were dinner roll size, not hamburger bun sized.

In general, bread doesn't rise in 20 minutes.  No instructions were given such as warming the milk to activate the yeast.   My hamburger buns were hard and chalky.

I agree with the others, about heating the milk.  I also added a tablespoon of "bread improver" per cup of flour and it made them extra soft, rather than the heavy roll texture I've gotten in the past when I've tried to make buns in the past.

These were good as dinner rolls, but not really as a bun. I made half the recipe first, then a second batch. For the second batch I made them a little larger and flattened them, but it really just wasnt burger material. Delicious none the less.

These were good, but they go stale very quickly, so I would suggest making only what you need and using them right away, or freezing them. I don't think I'll make these again. Rather, I will use the recipe on this site for "bread machine bagels" and form buns instead of bagel shapes. The bagel recipe came out much more like a burger/dog bun than any other bread recipe I've tried.

I reduced the recipe to 6 buns and used half wheat flour and substituted applesauce for the butter. I also mixed the milk, applesauce, sugar, and water and microwaved it before I added the yeast. I guess I got a little carried away because I accidentally added an extra cup of milk, so after when I added the flour I just kept adding more until the dough was manageable (I didn't change any of the other measurements). Then I let the dough rise for about an hour before I cooked it and the bun turned out great! They we're too dense and even made a great bread all by themselves. :)

While I like the flavor of these buns, they turned out a bit too dense for me to be used for hamburger buns.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of letting the dough rise for 2 hours rather than 20 minutes.  I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but I didn't get as airy a bread as I would have liked.

I had a very difficult time with this recipe, the buns did not rise and looked/tasted/were the consistency of biscuits.  I am giving them 4 stars, because the flavor was good as biscuits.    We had these with Grandma's Sloppy Joes (a really great recipe too!)  Will try again on this one

Turned out great! I used active dry yeast instead of instant. Then used the bowl of hot water (heated in kettle) under the buns inside the oven to make them rise quickly.

I was craving hamburgers, but did not want to run to the store for buns.  These buns tasted good and had a good texture.  I put 25 round balls on sheets to rise in oven and while they had a nice rise, they were still pretty small.  I ended up having to reshape patties into slider sizes, so we had sliders for dinner instead of the hamburgers I had planned to serve.

I basically used this recipe for the measurements and ingredients and with my directions they turned out perfectly. The milk and water need to be the perfect temp for yeast so it needs to be warm. I started my dough in the bread machine then after it rose I kneaded it with a little flour until it was nice and elastic. At this point I separated it into 16 buns.... not 24 they would have been way too small. I then laid them on baking sheets, covered them with a cloth and let them rise for another 30 minutes. I used an egg/ water wash and sprinkled with sesame seeds before putting them in the oven for 15 minutes at 375. Hope this helps some of the people who are having trouble :)

Excellent basic recipe!
I did plenty 'wrong' and they still came out so right! I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and about 4 all-purpose flour. I made them dairy free by using only water and oil instead of milk and butter, and used active dry yeast. I let them rise in the warm oven for about 30 minutes and got 20 nice sized buns that were absolutely soft and delicious!

This was certainly MUCH better than the first bun recipe I tried. Not an Allrecipes one. These are light, airy and my family loves them. The only thing I did differently was to brush some butter on the tops. YUM!

It tasted great fresh out of the oven, just one comment , It spread out too much, next time I will shape them so that wont happen again. I used 2% milk  to reduce the Fat content. I will make them again !. Thanks

How did I like this recipe, you ask? Well, after the first batch came out so darned good, I made four more batches. I now have small rolls for breakfast and dinner, hamburger and hotdog rolls, and long rolls for subs, hoagies, poboys (whatever someone knows them by.) Will I keep this recipe as it is? You betcha! Will I make them again ... oh yes!

Never made em, never will. I just would like to rate the ratings. How can people rate the recipes 4 or 5 stars and then completely rewrite the recipe. This seem to happen on all the recipes, not just this one. It may be kind to give a good rating to the person nice enough to post the original but it is not at all helpful for those of us looking for a truly superior recipe. Some ratings  post an entirely new recipe that should be listed separately. I guess those people don't want to risk getting rated themselves. Please rate em as you see um then place your apologies in the comment and reference your recipe under a new title. Just my opinion. Thanks to all who take the time to make these boards great.

I make these exactly as written, and they are great.  I do notice that the bottom rack always needs a few more minutes of baking time, so rotating might be in order.  Nothing like homemade buns!

Loved this recipe. It is very easy to only make half of the recipe. I do not see how one can get the 25 rolls that it calls for unless you want mini size buns though. I got about 16 regular size buns out of this recipe. I will definitely be making this recipe again for things that call for a heartier bread.

Mine were a little dense for a hamburger bun.  More like a roll.

Great recipe. Very easy to follow. Mine rose perfectly and in hindsight, I made them way to big!! (made only 10) I'll have to work on that. But my trick for helping them rise is take a tea towel (the one you've been drying your hands on is best) if its not slightly damp then wet it and throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds or so. It'll come out pretty warm and I cover my bread or buns like that. Works every time for me. :)

Great recipe just as it is written..however, due to dairy allergies in our fam I substitute almond milk for the milk & coconut oil for the margarine.  They always turn out great & now I don't have to buy buns from the store with ingredients that are gmo or that I can't pronounce :)

Definitely a keeper! Used butter vs. margarine and made 16 vs. 24 for a larger size, let it raise a bit longer than in recipe and also in a warm oven.  Rubbed butter on top when I took them from the oven.  So soft inside.  Yum yum yum!  For actual hamburger buns I'd make 12-14 just to make them just a wee bit bigger.  Used them with shredded pork.  Husband said, these would make great hamburger buns.  Ha! :-D

These were very easy to make and the taste was good. I found that it took quite a long time to knead, however. They do rise considerably and I weighed the dough at 4.8 oz before rising and they came out too big for our tastes. Next time, I'll weigh them at 3oz and go from there. Thanks!

This recipe is simple and turns out perfectly. The warm water should be about baby bottle warm and combined with the warm butter it should be the right temp. Baking Bread is a science so play around with it. I also do not add cold milk. I use this for sandwich rolls, cinnamon rolls, buns and quick dinner rolls.

My husband loved this. I thought that they were good too, but I thougt that they were more like a dinner roll, then a hamburger bun. I thought that it would take much longer for them to raise butit did only take about 20-30 min, i had preheated my oven to 200 (lowest it would go), i had also places a 13x9 baking dish on the bottom rack then placed my rolls on the top rack and closed the door, 
The last 5 mins or so of baking  brushe with more butter and sprinkled some parm cheese on top. So good. i was out of garlic salt so i could not use that. but i wll nest time. I will probably make this again.

New bread baker and really pleased.  Cut recipe to make just 6 in case it did not work.   Followed exactly (not sure how much yeast so used 1/2 tsp.  Amazing - tomorrow making the whole recipe and going to sub some 9-grain flour.  
Did also find not large enough for a burger so will make them larger.  A keeper

These were great for my first time making bread. I halved the recipe and since I don’t really eat white bread I substituted with whole wheat flour (accounting for the fact that it usually requires more liquid.) While they didn’t yield the half amount, they were really yummy and quick and easy to make. I’m fairly new to working with yeast but I do not think they would have turned out well had I never worked with yeast before. The directions do not offer much guidance apart from the bare essentials so I used the techniques from my other yeast recipes and some of the helpful reviews. Nevertheless, it’s a good recipe and I think this will be my “go to” for experimenting with breads.

This recipe was amazing!! So, my husband shot a deer this season and I was trying my hardest to make a 5 star meal out of the meat for our family friends one night. I made these buns to go on our feta avocado deer burgers. OMG it was amazing! I got rave reviews from everyone for the bread. My husband was upset there were none left over for him. But. I ended up giving him some of mine. He liked them so much im making them again today for my ground turkey buffalo & ranch burgers! Follow it exactly like it says and its fool proof! VERY VERY Delicious! Just like bread at Schlotzkys!

Love this and is my favorite bread recipe!  Tastes great and so simple to make.  It doesnt take much time at all and I even used it to make bread bowls.  I usually half the recipe and get 2 bowls.  Only thing I've had to do different is lower the oven temp and cook a bit longer but thats probably my oven :)

I made these after searching for egg-free hotdog buns. I followed other website instructions on how to create a hotdog bun - which are much more complicated that a hamburger bun. Anyways, I found they didn't rise well (even after following the instructions). They were more dense than fluffy. It could have been due to the 'hotdog' adaptation.

I had to make them twice.  The first time I did not let them rise enough.  They still tasted good but were hard.  The next time I let them rise for 30 minutes and they were wonderful!

Very good basic buns.  They were a little small, so I would make 8 instead of 12 if you want a burger on it.  Also, I cooked it for a few mintes less than recommended, but I am at high altitude.

This is a great recipe....I like to use regular yeast, because I never use instant.  I loved them for hamburgers and cold sandwiches, but found them too rich for something like sloppy joes/bbq.  The rich flavor of the buns seemed to compete with them.  Then I realized that the dough was so rich that it might be a very good sweet dough recipe; I doubled it and found that it was awesome made into cinnamon rolls and raisin bread, just adding the sugar/cinnamon mixture, a little extra butter (for cinnamon rolls) and raisins.  Out of this world!

The taste was fine, but the recipe did not make 25 "hamburger" sized buns. When I divided it, it was more like dinner rolls. I thought because of all the yeast and the reviews that it would rise better, but they really didn't rise that much. I also subbed 3 cups whole wheat flour for 3 cups of the white flour!

I'm not a huge bread person but my husband is. He gave these the "you can make them again" approval.  I made them larger than the recipe called for and it yielded about 9.  Next time I will still make them wide but flatter because they rose quite a bit more than I expected.  I enjoyed the 20 minute rise time the most.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I never have hamburger buns on hand when I want them and hate making special trips to the store.  These would also work as dinner rolls.

I made it yesterday... I followed the recipe exactly, except for the ingredients, I used only 1/2 the quantity & got 6 large buns, next time I'll make them a bit smaller since they tend to puff up pretty good! It needed just a little more flour about 1/2 a cup. I brushed the buns with egg wash & sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Other than that, the recipe was perfect. Actually, I was amazed when I got them out of the oven, they looked perfect & flawless :) Thanks for posting this!

This is a great bread recipe.  I have to agree that the 20 min rise time is way too short. I gave them an hour and it made 11 huge buns/dinner rolls. Next time I'll do the 2 hour rise time to get them a little less dense.

these buns were easy to make & delish.  i made them smaller for little sliders & they worked out perfectly.  i froze quite a few of them since it is just the two of us.  thawed & warmed in micro for dinners all week.  my mother-in-law loved them!!  that in itself is a coup  yay!!

This recipe was amazing!  I never use instant yeast so I just let mine rise longer than it called for.  Makes a perfect hamburger bun.  I've made this twice this week so far.. works great for lunch leftovers.. leftover roast sandwhiches, leftover turkey, etc..

my changes: 1/4 c flat beer instead of warm water....added 1 egg to the recipe.....and soften butter......not melted margarine...i had to tweak the dough consistency by adding little bit of flour and some oil  ....let my bread maker do the kneading and allowed 1 rise...before reshaping the dough and baking.....these buns were very soft..any tips on how to  make these buns harder?

these were awesome. the only thing they did puff up to about triple their size.  I made out 8 and should have made about 12. I mixed these all in my bread machine, after mixing I put in a warm oven with a pan of warm water.  I will  make these again. I also used honey instead of sugar and butter instead of margarine. Thanks for a great recipe.

followed the recipe and no fluffy buns here. only dense rolls that were more like a hard french roll. I am gonna try again with some of the recommendations of other reviewers, but will not make as stated again. Sorry, but didn't work for me.

I make a lot of bread, but it is usually  an all day thing, and I don't always have time for that. This recipe is great because it is so fast but still comes out tasting really good. (Generally you have to sacrifice one or the other.) The only changes I would make would be to decrease the sugar - they were too sweet for my taste - and to make them a bit larger. These were fine if you are wanting dinner roll sized rolls, but really too small for sandwiches. (Maybe a White Castle style burger!) Otherwise a very nice, easy and tasty bun!

Made them for lunch. started at 10:25 and pulled the first tray out by 11:45. Was a good and easy recipes. used 2 cups of wheat flour and turned out well. But I only got twenty buns and not twenty five. They where small but I had 1/6lb patty so they worked well. Will use many times.No more store bought buns for me. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed the advice of other reviewers on how to combine the ingredients and how to raise with hot water, but they still did not raise enough for hamburger buns, even after an hour. They are pretty good dinner rolls though.

Well, if I was an experienced bread maker, maybe these would have turned out better.  As it is they don't look too good, and I'm not sure they're going to taste good.  Instructions are too vague.  I wasn't sure whether to knead the dough or not, or whether to grease my pan. (I kneaded a little and thoroughly greased my pan.)  Should I have let them rise some more while the oven preheated (I didn't).  How do I get them brownde on top.  I just hope they taste better than they look.

Wow. I'm really impressed. I made the dough in my bread maker and had to let them rise a little longer than 20 minutes, more like 30, and baked exactly 15 and they were perfect. PERFECT! They were soft and fluffy and tasted wonderful. I was very apprehensive about using A/P flour and not bread, and only doing one rise, but I stuck too it and it was worth it. So easy and quick I'll definitely be using this recipe over and over. ::::UPDATE:::: I DO make these over and over, and now my hubby has started insisting I make them for hamburgers. Also make them for sausage sandwiches and good lord they are good!

Great recipe a little crusty if you brush with butter in stead of milk. also if you want a softer bun like what you get at the market add less milk and more butter. you might want to exsperement a little with the milk to butter ratio. I also add 1tsp of dried garlic and 1tsp of black pepper an everyone i have served these too loved them. and dont be afraid to add your own flavors.

Went in the kitchen to make these buns and realized I did not have instant yeast or very much white flour.  So, I used double rise yeast and wheat flour.  Did not rise much,(even after letting it rise twice) but has a great flavor and texture.  I will try this recipe again!

Just made these today when I realized I forgot the buns when shopping. I substituted 2 cups all purpose flour with wheat flour, made the dough in the bread machine and then shaped and baked in the oven. My child doesn't normally like bread, but she asked for more after sampling a bite. Husband loved it too. The conclusions are: 1. These are better than buns bought from the store.  2. This could easily be made as a loaf bread.  3. We're going to use this to make cloverleaf rolls for the holidays.

LOVED IT! Used "rapid rise" yeast and mine took a few hours to rise. Added garlic powder, garlic salt to the dough. Brushed tops with egg and sprinkled sesame seeds & poppy seeds as well. beautiful, soft and delish. added a very special touch to the meal. THANK YOU so much for the recipe!

tasted awesome! they didn't rise much before baking so they did not turn out as large as I had hopped. Also if you form "balls" like it says you will wind up with verry spherical buns. next time I will try making them more patty shaped so they will be bigger and fit the hamburgers better.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have a four person family and we could never eat 25 buns.  I take the dough and make as many buns as I need, then I use the remainder of the dough to make cinamon swirl bread. Thanks for the recipe...it was fantastic!!!

I thought this was a good point to start and you can change it as you like. I put half white flour and half whole wheat. I place of the sugar I used honey. I mixed it as directed using my KitchenAid standing mixer with the dough hook. The dough was sticky but a bit of flour on my bread board helped. I cut the dough in half and rolled each half into logs so that I could then cut those into dough pucks that I baked on parchment paper. They didn't rise as quickly as stated but that my have been due to the fact that I used whole wheat flour and honey. The taste and texture were great I will be making these again.

I lov this recipe my whole party was raving about these buns.  I needed really small buns for my Spooky Halloween Party and these were perfect.  Rally easy, the only problem I was unsure when to stop adding flour the dough took alot of flour to get to a point that I thought it would be ready to roll.  Other than that great recipe, if you want to be the hit of your next function make these buns.  Way better than store bought.

This recipe was so easy to make. I love it!  I substituted the sugar for honey because I don't eat sugar. I look forward to playing with this recipe and making other kinds of rolls out of it.

I just made this for  Saturday night supper of sloppy joes ... the buns made it really special.  I only made 1/2 the recipe because I was low on staples.  I used bread flour because I had it in my pantry and I warm the milk/water/butter mixture in the mircrowave for less than a minute.  I proofed the yeast while I pulled on my bread machine and programed it for "dough".  I use my bread machine and let the rolls bench proof.  I got eight large rolls and could have made them into twelve if I wanted.  Bottom, they were easy to make w/ the machine and I was really please w/ the end product.

I don't think this is a beginner's recipe.  I read all the reviewers' hints and suggestions, read the instructions on my yeast packets thoroughly, and I still ended up with heavy, lumpy, yeasty buns.  I'll try it again and see if I can get the hang of it.

I followed the recipe msmnts. The directions wern't very clear but I know how to bake a little!
My buns looked great but they had very little flavour (just plain and bland) and they din't hold up well to the condiment and handling process. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

If you know what you are doing when making bread, this basic recipe is great. I will make it again and again.  Thank you, Cheeron, I am glad to have your hamburger bun recipe!

I used rice milk instead of milk, butter instead of margarine, and active dry yeast instead of instant. I got the conversion from someone else, and put in 2 tbsp and 2 tsp of yeast. The instructions weren't great, like many others have said. I instead heated the milk, butter, water, and sugar together, then added the yeast and let it bubble. Then added the dry ingredients. The buns did rise but it took longer than the recipe said. They ended up being really yummy, but tasted a bit like yeast. I'm new at this, so I'm just guessing I might have put too much yeast in them.

Tasted good but I would really wish for softer buns :) I followed the recipe exactly except that I halved everything and used butter instead of margarine.

I think that the liquid may have been too hot as the yeast didn't rise.  I have another recipe that takes a little longer, but I think I'll use that in the future.

I was looking  for the ligt fluffy store-bought texture but didn't find that with these as they didn't rise well. That may be, however, because I didn't heat the liquid enough (~105 F). The result was okay, a little on the doughy side. Decent taste, not yeasty.

I made these hamburger buns this afternoon in the hopes that I could serve them as a beef dip sandwich.  The flavour of the buns was much like hamburger buns in that the flavour was pretty neutral, but we found that the texture was very heavy and dense compared to a traditional hamburger bun.  Because the interior of the bun was so doughy, they didn't really work very well as a bun for a beef dip, but they would be fine as dinner rolls.

These were pretty good. My whole family liked them. They were  bit heavy, and a little chalky, but that was propbaly because i didnt use 2 packs of yeast, so there wasnt as much dough, so the taste was to thick.otherwise, it would have tasted awsome and SOOOO GOOD!! I didnt have super fast yeast, so i used one pack of regular yeast, and let them rise for a little longer, like, 30 minutes to 45 minutes. I also made sure i followed faeriecat's sugestions about warming the milk and the yeast foamed in 30sec, but i let it totaly foam for about 5 minutes. i baked them for 15 minutes, and they were perfect. we made spongbob's krabby patties with these. my brother LOVED them. Thanks for the recipie! ill make these again.
