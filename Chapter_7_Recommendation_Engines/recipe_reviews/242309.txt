Excellent! It really does taste like fruit punch! I couldn't stop eating it - I ate a double serving today and am saving the rest to accompany tomorrow's breakfast. A great way to use up leftover fruit! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Synexx!

I made this salad as a healthier alternative to a birthday cake since my husband said he didn't want cake and I was adamant we were going to have something sweet. I went ahead and cut up and added the other half of the orange and a banana as well. This was very tasty! Only make as mush as you'll consume in a sitting, however, as it gets a bit soft and squishy the next day.
