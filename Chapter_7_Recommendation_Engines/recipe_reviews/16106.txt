As my husband is Chinese, I would like to offer the following "tip" to make this more "authentic":
After the last step, but just prior to serving, whip up 1 raw egg with a fork and slowly add to the boiling soup, stirring constantly.  You will notice the difference immediately!

I made a couple of changes you might like! Double the viniger to 2 table spoons, triple the corn starch to 3 table spoons, add about a teaspoon of powdered ginger, use olive oil in place of cooking oil for cooking the vegtables of coarse still useing the sesame oil as indicated for its wonderful flavor, mix yellow and red peppers for color and if you have a favorite hot pepper use it with or in place of the red peper flakes but still use the ground black pepper! I hope you like my little modifcations. Is more sour (VINIGER) with a nice texture (CORN STARCH) and warm after taste (FAVORITE PEPER plus the GINGER!)

Not like in any Chinese restaurant I'VE been to in the past 40 years.  I doubled the soy, vinegar, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and cornstarch, and added some chopped shitake and button mushrooms, and it's still too watery.  This is all wrong!  It's not all that bad a soup, but make no mistake: This is NOT even close to The Real Thing!  The bell pepper is unnecessary, and where are the bamboo shoots?  Next time, I'll just head for the nearest take-out joint.

I make a Hot and Sour Soup which is pretty similar...but with a few modifications!  I use 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 4 oz tofu, 4 oz pork tenderloin cut into strips, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 egg gently folded in towards the end, mushrooms and some canned bamboo shoots cut into strips.  To make things real authentic, you should probably use shiitake and broken tree ear mushrooms...but I'm usually lazy and just toss in some from a can until it looks good! :P    Absolutley NO bell peppers of any sort!!  I've never seen this in a real restaraunt!  I don't use water chesnuts, either...not only do I just not like them, I've just never seen them in a restaraunt version!  Everything else is pretty much the same!!  Hope this helps with some of the complaints I've been hearing!!

This had a most lovely flavor. My family and I loved this soup. A few suggestions...The bell pepper is unecassary. Soup way too thin and had to add 3 TBSP more corn starch. Hot&sour soup doesn't exist w/o eggs so I scrambled 2 eggs in a bowl and slowly poured it in at the end of the process. Added a couple handfuls of clean and cooked shrimp...wonderful!

My husband and I liked this soup very much. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added one raw egg at the end. Made all the difference in color and thickness. Also added a drop or two of tabasco sauce to "spice it up a notch." Can"t wait to have it again!

The taste of this soup is fine.  My wife and I both thought it was okay.  Still, as others have said, in the hundreds of Chinese restaurants I've dined in through the years, I've never had a hot and sour soup that tasted even close to this:  It's too watery (better increase the corn starch), no cabbage, no bamboo shoots, and I've never seen hot and sour soup with peppers of any kind in the mix.  If called something else, I might have given this recipe four stars, but since the recipe is called hot and sour soup, I'm rating it relative to it's claim of being a hot and sour soup.  Relative to other hot and sour soups I've had, this was quite marginal.

This is an "alright" starter recipe for a beginner chef I suppose but nothing like I have had in 30+ years. I had to make MULTIPLE changes for this to even be somewhat similar to a traditional "restaurant H&S soup"... First the broth makes it taste too "chicken-y". Perhaps a clarified broth would work better. There is not enough vinegar or spice to this either. I ended up doubling the red pepper flakes and adding a few dashes of habenero sauce.  I doubled the vinegar and tripled the cornstarch. Also double the soy sauce and add fresh grated ginger. H&S is not supposed to have water chestnuts or peas in it- so omit those. There also needs to be button or baby bella sliced mushrooms, some wood-ear mushrooms, and some very thinly sliced pork strips. I DID however like the addition of the red bell pepper- but I sliced mine into very thin strips. And definitely add the egg at the very end but make sure the soup is not boiling and is on an extremely low simmer or your egg will break apart very easily and not taste very good! Like I said, good base, but I would not serve without a major doctoring up!

My husband and I really liked this soup.  I used 3 Tbsp of cornstarch, 2 Tbsp of vinegar, and I added mushrooms and an egg.  It's a meal in a bowl.

I didn't really care for this recipe.  However, my idea of hot and sour is jaded due to the fact that my mom use to serve the best hot and sour soup at her restaurant.  However, the recipe is quick and easy.  Not bad if you have all the ingredients.

This is a favorite with my family - I usually add vegetables such as bok choy or Napa cabbage. I serve it with "sticky" rice.

I read through all the reviews before making this and made some adjustments. I loved how it turned out!    I read that a lot of people thought the chicken broth made it too chicken-y so I used water instead and added one chicken bullion cube. I didn't think it was too much chicken at all - couldn't even tell it was in there. Doubled the soy, vinegar, red pepper flaxes. I used 3 tbs of cornstarch vs 1 in the recipe. If I had any mushrooms in the house when I made it I would have added a couple and only used half the red pepper. Also my package of tofu was 12oz vs 8oz so I used the whole thing. I omitted the peas and water chestnuts. At the end I added 2 scrambled eggs instead of 1 - I like a lot of egg in my soup but you'd probably be best with just 1.    All in all I would definitely make this recipe again and only do 2 things different - 1 egg vs 2 and add mushrooms. I thought it turned out great, but definitely needs some tweaking. It was the perfect thing to help my head cold late at night.

Nice soup recipe.  I did end up using a bit more cornstarch since 1 tablespoon did not thicken it as much as I liked.  Other than that...tasted great.

When I was done with this recipe, it became a 5 STAR recipe.
I added 3 T of soy sauce, juice of 1 lemon (this is key), plus some bean sprouts, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I also made it again and added 1/3 lb cooked pork.  YUM

I tripled the cornstarch and it was still a little watery.  Also although the sour part is about right if you use 2 tablespoons of vinegar, it's not very hot.  I'll have to work on that part.   Being creative is part of cooking.  I really liked having the red pepper in it.  I also added about 5 ounces of button mushrooms that I sautéed.  Thanks for giving me a good starting point Ann.  This is better than other recipes I’ve tried.

A fairly good soup, although as others note, it was more watery than expected and I would add more cornstarch.  I also don't think the water chestnuts "go" and used some white mushrooms instead.  Not like the hot and sour at any Chinese restaurant I've ever been to, but nevertheless a decent soup.  Definitely easy to prepare, since you can chop the next ingredients as it simmers.

This was very good.  I ommitted the bell pepper and water chestnuts, added an extra green onion and used white wine vinegar since it was all I had on hand.  The end of the cooking I added a scrambled egg with water to the soup and it was terrific.  We are having with Spam fried rice.

A beautiful colorfull soup but it never got bubbly or thick.  I'd use a bit more Corn starch and maybe Beef Broth instead of the chicken.  Just my personal taste.  I also used the whole 14 oz. of tofu.

I really loved this soup Ann. Although I'm not a huge fan of tofu, I do love it in hot and sour soup. Unfortunately I didn't have any on hand, so to add some protein to this dish, I poached a piece of tilapia in the broth. I did add more vinegar and used chili flavored sesame oil for even more heat. Like others, I needed to use more cornstarch and it thickened up just right. Delicious lunch for me today and thanks for the submission!

It seemed a little too watery for my tastes, had to add more veggies and make it thicker with more cornstarch.

I used More red pepper flakes, black pepper, and red wine vinegar than this recipe listed.  This was still Not Hot and Not Sour.  thank you for the suggested recipe, but please do NOT call it hot and sour soup.  it was bland and unappealing.

I used all chicken broth, no water. Also I added tender bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I drizzled in an egg so it was similar to egg drop soup. I added a 5 oz can of chicken also. Another addition was some match-stick carrots. I hate runny hot and sour so I thickened it a bit more with corn starch. It came out very nice.

I love H&S soup, so I tried this recipe. I wish I would have tripled the cornstarch and vinegar as others have mentioned. (I wish I had read the reviews first.) The soup did not get thick. The bell pepper was unnecessary. I think 8 oz of tofu was too much. I also added egg at the end (every H&S soup I've eaten in restaurants has had egg - however, I needed to add it MORE SLOWLY.

I thought this was good soup and easy. I added ginger and Sriracha to mine, along with mushrooms and bamboo shoots. I also forgot to pick up tofu at the store; that's probably why I don't feel like this was super-special, but it's good. I'll make it again.
