Great veg burger! The veggie-bean-spice flavors melded quite nicely.  Alterations: I substituted corn for mushrooms and didn't use mozzarella or as much bread crumbs. My burgs needed to cook for a bit longer than was recommended.  Served them on wheat buns with guac, lettuce, and salsa. I'll definitely make again.  These were totally Tex-Mex, so I might try to change ingredients and toppings to make different "themed" veggie burgs: Italian (basil, oregano, thyme, sundried tomatoes, grated parm), Asian (soy, ginger, broccoli), Mediterranean (chickpeas, olives, garlic, oregano, feta) etc.

I have not tried this, but, have heard it is a good sub for eggs as a binder in recipes, like meatloaf, so I'm sure it would work here for these burgers as a sub for those that are lacto-vegetarian  The Recipe: Flaxseed Egg-Substitute 1/2 cup flaxseed  1 1/2 cup water Directions: Grind flaxseed to a fine powder in an electric coffee grinder.  Mix flaxseed and water in blender and blend on high for 2 minutes.  Chill for 1 hour to set up. It can be used now, but it has a more egg-like consistency if allowed to chill.  Keep refrigerated up to 3 days. Using the Flaxseed Mixture: 1/4 cup of flax mixture = 1 Egg  1 cup of flax mixture = 4 Eggs

I substitute flaxseed and water all the time for eggs.  One egg is equal to one tbsp ground flaxseed plus 3 tbsp water.  Works great - but gives a slightly nuttier flavour than eggs.

These were really delicious!  I baked them, and they looked beautiful.  I had to add about twice the amount of bread crumbs, but followed everything else exactly, and then when cooked, topped them with mashed avocado, tomato, and American cheese, and they were great :-).  Very filling, too!

This is one of the BEST burger recipes I have made!! I read a lot of the reviews before I made these and noted that a lot of people said they did not hold together well. I did not want to add a lot more bread crumbs like many people had to do because that meant more calories and I am on a diet so this is what I came up with and it worked great. For starters, I sauteed the peppers, onions and mushrooms in a little olive oil then added them to the beans. Secondly, I found that instead of putting everything in a food processor, mash the beans by hand so you get a courser mix not mush. Lastly, I formed them into patties and put them in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking. The result was a veggie patty that held together great. I did cut down on the cumin and chili pepper as others suggested as well. All in all, it is a great recipe!!

My family loved these burgers!  I made 8 small patties from the recipe.  I cooked them all and then froze 4 of them for later.  I just reheated them in the oven at 425 for 6 min on each side.  They we great!  I didn't use the hot sauce but followed all the other ingredients exactly.  You definitely need to top them off with lots of fresh veggies.( lettuce,onion,tom....ect)I will be making a huge batch to freeze for sports nights when I need to have a fast healthy meal.  Thank you for the great recipe! To make the patties I lined a small container with saran wrap  and then pushed the filling in and made them as big as I wanted.  Then I just dropped them onto the pan.  It works great.

This is so delicious! I made it for a backyard get together and even the "meat loving men" loved them!  They are so yummy, especially if you top them with avocado.

It was just ok. Tasted mostly the chili powder. When i think of veggie burgers i imagine a "meatier" texture kinda like the morning star brand veggie burger. This should be called a black bean burger. It was edible but nothing i would make again. Will continue my search.

I also added grilled veggies and onions. My aluminum caught fire, but didn't harm anything. Found it nessacary to spray canola oil on spatula to flip them.Also used cayenne instead of chili powder and added fresh cilantro.

Loved the flavour but had trouble with the texture-used the flax seed substitution for eggs, for my vegan husband. Ended up frying to get a "sturdier" patty. Any suggestions?

These were really tasty! We omitted the mushrooms because of non-mushroom eaters, and added some Worcestershire sauce. We ended up needing way more bread crumbs so be sure to drain beans well! The patties didn't hold together very well and tried to stick a lot, so next time we're going to brush them with olive oil.

Loved this, but obviously made a few changes b/c, well, who doesn't? lol  Added 1 extra can of beans, 1 red and 1 green bell pepper, 1 1/2 c of brown rice, 2 cups of pepper jack cheese, whole wheat cracker crumbs, and 6 eggs (help it hold together really well and gave it a very meaty flavor).  Not sure about the exact measurement, but I ended up using 1 1/2 sleaves of cracker crumbs.  Also, after blending the veggies, I drained off the excess liquid like was suggested in previous reviews.  It ended up kind of close to the texture of really thick chunky peanut butter when done.  Also, to give it a nice crunch, I dredged the outside of each patty w/ crumbs and pan fried them in an olive oil/butter mixture for 7-9 minutes each side on medium heat (wanted to make sure all that egg was cooked through).  No need for an egg wash since the mix is already so moist.  Oh, and just so you guys know, I served these on whole wheat chiabatta rolls with spinach, tomato slices, and hummus instead of mayo.  My friends are consumate meat eaters and even they adored these!  One even asked me for the recipe so he could make them himself!  I'm thinking about melting slices of fresh mozzerella on top of each patty under the broiler next time.  We really like cheese around here! lol

I was really excited about this recipe, followed it exactly and was not happy with the result. First of all, the cooking time is absolutely NOT long enough. In fact, I'm not sure how long they should cook, because after grilling them for over an hour, I finally moved them to bake in the oven, and another 30 minutes longer they were still mushy inside. I tried another batch with more bread crumbs and had the same problem. And second, the taste was bad. All I could taste was the chili powder, which now that I think about it, is kind of a strange spice to add so much of. Not to mention, this recipe is time consuming. I spent almost 3 hours between prep and cooking, which is just entirely too long when I have 3 hungry, cranky children waiting to be fed. And then on top of it all, they tasted bad and I ended up having to whip up something else for dinner in a hurry. I have no idea how to fix this recipe to my liking. My search will continue!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but had a difficult time with the mush texture.  The flavor was OK, but not great.  Like many other reviewers, I had a very difficult time keeping the burgers together while cooking them.   I tried putting the patties in the fridge for an hour before cooking, but they still fell apart.    I halved the recipe and it still made 6 patties.

I did this recipe last night. I was hesitant at first thinking it would be complicated. First was amazed how easy it was to get together with what I already had. I did not grill (I live in Chicago and it was 30 degrees). I chose to bake then pan fry a bit. I also left out the chili powder and hot sauce because neither I nor my daughter can handle spicy foods. I added a tad bit of Worcestershire and Liquid Smoke to give it that grilled flavor. The rest of the recipe I followed. And they turned out very well. Mine fell apart a bit, so maybe next time I will add more egg and/or bread crumbs. But I was really impressed. I didn't miss meat at all and will make this again.

This recipe is wonderful! My only tips are to use old fashioned oat meal in place of the dried bread crumbs and to cook it on a forman grill (if you have one) . It's so easy!

My wife and I recently switched our diet and have been looking for a "good" substitution for the good old hamburger.  Not only was this terrific, but it makes enough that we browned up the rest and are saving it to add to salads tomorrow.

Instead of canned beans, I made my own from dried, and I did not put in the hot sauce.  I also scooped it with a muffin scoop and pressed it flat in a burger press between sheets of was paper so that they cooked evenly on my grill.

My only suggestion would be to increase the number of servings this recipe makes.  Even using the large muffin scoop the burgers were 7 inches across and 3/4" thick and I made 17 burgers.

These were really yummy! I followed the recipe as stated except I was out of cumin but I found it didn't really need it. Cooked them on the grill on aluminum foil until they firmed up then removed the foil. Next time I may make these ahead and let them form up in the fridge a bit. I sprayed my foil with veg oil but they still stuck quite a bit.

This was my first homemade veggie burger.  I had to triple, maybe quadruple the breadcrumbs to get them to a manageable consistency.  I didn't love them as burgers... but I ate crumbled up the leftovers and used it for taco meat.  As a burger, I'd give this three stars.  It was too mushy for my preference.  I'll stick with this recipe for my black bean tacos from now on though.

I had to add double the bread crumbs, but otherwise incredible. I pan fried them on medium High for six minutes a side. Everyone was gushing about how great they were.

Excellent recipe. By far the best veggie burgers I have found. I use 1 can of black beans and 1 can of red kidney beans, omit the garlic and onions (I find they do not cook well enough and the taste becomes overwhelming), and change the spices according to my mood. Most days I just add hot sauce and seasoning salt. I also use crumbles soda crackers instead of bread crumbs. Just add until the right consistency is achieved.

The vegetarians and omnivores (& my rather carnivorous husband) all raved about these - and all had seconds! A food processor made it easy to whip these up for a cook-out. This recipe is a keeper for family meals & entertaining alike!

This is by far the best veggie burger I have tried so far. The texture was much meatier than most and the flavor was great. I believe it must be the additions of rice and cheese in this recipe that make the difference. I simplified the prep process a bit by just putting everything at once in the food processor, adding the rice in for the last few pulses. Then I stirred in the entire half cup of bread crumbs. The only change I made was omitting the tbsp of garlic salt and subbing a tsp of no salt garlic herb seasoning instead. Only because I didn't want the extra salt, and the 6 cloves of garlic were already more than enough for me. The recipe made 4 times as much as the suggested serving of 6 patties. But that's ok, as I bagged the excess and froze for three more quick and easy meals. The patties were dead easy to form and held together well. I grilled them directly on my indoor grill for the suggested time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't care for this at all. the flavor was okay, but the texture was mush. I even added extra breadcrumbs and fried the patties after taking them out of the over, but they were still too soft and completely fell apart. No one liked them, except my bf, who will eat anything! Would definitely NOT make these again!

My family enjoyed these burgers.  I followed the recipe closely, using a red pepper instead of green.  They didn't "set up" as well as I hoped.  Next time, I will finely chop the veggies instead of put in food processor (which liquified the raw veggies), use a little more bread crumbs, and maybe make smaller burgers.  I served them with sliced avacado, cheddar cheese, and spicy ranch dressing.  Yum!

Tasty, but I needed to add at least twice the amount of bread crumbs so the patties wouldn't fall apart.  I also then needed to up the amount of spices.  They were very tasty when all was said and done!

I actually cooked these in a nonstick pan and used used about an eighth cup more breadcrumbs and they were fine.  The smaller ones were easier to flip and were more firm than the bigger patties, so I'd recommend keeping them smaller if you cook these like this.  The taste was pretty good, but I agree with another reviewer that it would be better as a taco filling.  The texture just wasn't quite right to be a burger to me.  But I will definitely try this as a taco filling or a topping for nachos.  Mmm...

delicious! followed recipe exactly and cooked on the grill. 6 minutes per side on high heat was perfect. cannot figure out how/why this made 12 burgers instead of 6 but i'm very happy to have leftovers :)

The mixture fell apart so the bowl had to be stuck in the freezer for about 20 minutes to make it workable. We also had an incident due to forgetting to grease the foil, but after everything was sorted out they were really good. A friend of mine who hates veggie burgers came over to eat these with my family and me and loved them! Will make these again.

Best veggie burger I ever made!  I didn't have a food processor, so I chopped everything by hand.  Very fun to make.

These were good, but I did have trouble keeping the patty together. Since  it was cold, we didn't grill them but tried to bake them in the oven. It took much longer than 20 minutes. I ended up using some of the leftover bean mixture and cooking it over the stove top like pancakes and it cooked much quicker. It also made more than 6 servings, more like 10-12 servings. The leftovers the next day were crumbly so I heated them up and ate it in large lettuce leaves. It made an awesome filling for these makeshift lettuce wraps. I thought it tasted better than the day I made them.

I tried this recipe but the patties were HUGE!, made it into 12 servings, got rid of the cheese, substituted 3 egg whites for the eggs and garlic powder for the garlic salt. Used a sodium free homemade chili powder.  It is a wonderful recipe, will make this many times again.

excellent!  couldn't believe my husband thought they were really good even after he wasn't impressed with the thought of them while i was making them.  I used up whatever mushrooms I had-ended up being a whole cup of shitake, and I omitted the cumin- chili powder already has cumin so i didn't want it to be too strong.  increased the cheese- blend of mozza, cheddar.  I used a lot more breadcrumbs as i found it hard to form into patties because it kept breaking, but once cooked and cooled, they were fine.  
Made way more than 6- more like 12-14 patties.  We ate them with a touch of mayo, lots of avocado and tomato and they were fantastic! DIdn't even need a bun!

Excellent recipe!! Each time I make it, my guests are soooo amazed that a veggie burger could taste so good! Thanks for posting this great recipe. I want to make some today, but I don't have any cheese or mushrooms on hand. Hm... I'll let you know how it turns out. :) Also, instead of bread, i use ground almonds because I'm on a low carb diet. It's actually a mix of ground almonds, soybeans, and black sesame. It really gives the burgers a yummy kick!! Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Delicious. Lots of exciting flavors and textures in this burger. I altered slightly by adding one fresh jalapeno and using ground old fashioned oats instead of bread crumbs.

First attempt following directions (2 stars): Wow, I'm not sure what was so great about these.  Ours were dry on the outside and mush in the middle, so maybe something was lost in the cooking technique, but we followed the directions so I don't know what went wrong!  I was hesitant about using as much cumin as it called for but did it anyway.  I LOVE cumin, but that's all these tasted like.  Really?  All those awesome ingredients and all I got to taste was cumin?  I think spices and herbs should enhance what's there, not over power it.  EDIT (Second attempt - 4 stars): I had some mix leftover because we only made 4 burgers so the next day I added a bunch more bread crumbs, made the patties smaller and thinner and pan fried them.  I also used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup on the burger.  This way of cooking it up wasn't as healthy but brought the flavor and texture up from a 2 star to a 4 star rating!  If you have a small family, cut the recipe in half or be prepared to cook up a lot extra and freeze them for later.

Made these tonight exactly as written. Everyone enjoyed them. They were a little bit salty so I think next time I will use garlic powder in place of the garlic salt and maybe just add a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of salt. Thanks SweetPea!

I was excited to try this recipe but was disappointed.  The only thing I tasted was the ground cumin, which had a very strong taste that I did not like.  Would not try again.

These veggie burgers are delicious! Having been a vegetarian for many years, I am fairly picky about my burgers. I would definitely recommend these, and my non-vegetarian husband liked them as well. I added some soup powder to season the rice while it cooked; substituted shallots for the onions; used a full cup of whole wheat bread crumbs; and cooked the burgers with a little canola oil on a skillet.

This was super easy to make and would have been really fast except the brown rice takes forever to cook. These really were delicious. My husband is vegetarian and there is a resturant in town that makes burgers just like this, only they don't fall apart like ours did.. We really had trouble keeping them together. I added an extra egg and a couple of quick oats and put the rest of the burger mix in the fridge so hopefully tomorrow it will be more dense and make better burger patties. Otherwise, these were delicious.

This recipe was fantastic!  It had great flavor and holds up well if you cook it longer than the instructed time on both sides.  I used red pepper instead of green for a little more sweetness, and I added a little cayenne because we like our veggie burgers spicy.  I also omitted the rice due to time contsraints, so I had to add more bread crumbs.  Very good...I will make again!

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written and ended up with 12 burgers.  I popped them in the freezer for a bit after shaping them and they held together nicely for me.  They freeze well - I wrapped them individually after cooking and stacked them in the freezer.

Taste good, I'm frying batch 2.  I think they hold shape better if they are allowed to chill before cooking.
Update.  After making many veg burgers I discovered that you need 3 eggs for every can of beans.  Sounds like alot but it isn't if you want a meatier texture and don't want them to crumble on a bun.  The "batter" will be thick, just put about half a cup onto frying pan and cook on low heat for about 8 minutes each side.

For taste I give this the highest rating; however it didn't meet the texture requirements for a burger.  Rather I use these for a quesadilla filling.  I finely hand chop the pepper, onion, garlic and mushrooms as this seems to work better for me.  Also, I prepare them without the bread crumbs and form them into patties and freeze them.  I then cook the frozen patties in a little olive oil in a pan and use it for filling with melted cheese in a tortilla.  Serve with salsa and guacomole and it is delicious.

Decent start, but the texture wasn't good.  Way to much moisture in the food processor mix.  Following instructions to a T left a burger that was mushy and made me concerned about whether the egg was actually cooked.

It was  little too spicy for my husband and me, but it gave me good grounds to experiment with.

Yum, this was delicious! Not at all what you would expect to taste in a vegetable burger! I like the addition of cheese in the mixture.

While the recipe has great flavor, there are some issues.  First off, the recipe makes significantly more than 6 patties.  I made 3 huge patties and had enough left for at least 9 more.  So plan accordingly, you will likely need to reduce the recipe or freeze some of the mixture like I did.  The other main problem is, like many other reviews have mentioned, that the patties don't bind very well.  I would need to experiment to determine if more rice, bread crumbs or eggs would help these bind together easier.  If makes somehwat of a patty rather than a burger.   That all being said, we did like the flavor of the patties.

I halved this recipe.  My beef-loving famly rates this five stars, stating they like both the taste and the texture of this burger.  I used ground flax seed in place of the egg,  left out the garlic, cumin, garlic salt, chili powder, and hot sauce.  I added a dash of Worcestshire sauce and a generous tablespoon of steak sauce.  This mixture was left for two days in the fridge, then shoped and frozen into patties.  I pan-fried these in a little olive oil.  They were still a little soft, but held together with gentle treatment and were well-liked by all.  Next time I'll add some grated carrot and minced celery for a little more flavor and a few more oats to see if I can make a sturdier burger from this recipe.  This made four good-sized (probably 6 oz) patties.

I made this a few days ago, with only two changes to the original recipe - granulated garlic in place of the garlic salt, and oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  I did end up needing quite a bit more oatmeal to get it to stick together.  I first tried frying them with Pam, but they stuck horribly.  The taste was pretty good and the consistency was fine once I'd cooked them long enough.  It was my first veggie burger, and both my kids and I liked them well enough to eat them throughout the week.  I saved half the mixture and am baking them now.  I've baked them on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet for about 15 minutes at roughly 375* so far (my oven isn't very accurate, so you may need to experiment with this).  When I flipped them just now, they stayed together perfectly and looked much better than the pan-fried attempt.  They also looked much less 'mushy,' so this cooking method improves the consistency as well.  I also have to agree with the reviewers who said this recipe should make far more than 6 patties.  I'm using a 1/2 cup measuring cup and a quarter of the recipe came out to 3 1/2 burgers.

I didn't care for these.  I had high expectations after reading the reviews, but was disappointed.  I thought the kids would detest them, but two of my kids actually gobbled them down.  The burgers could have used more salt.  This was the first time I made veggie burgers and thought it was great to not worry about the raw meat, getting them to the right temp etc., so I will search for more recipes.  Oh, I cooked these in the grill pan on the stove.

I wondered how people followed the recipe "exactly" & yet got such different results.  I also thought the 6 cloves of garlic was a bit much.

Great flavor in these burgers, but the consistency was far too soft even after trying to add significantly more breadcrumbs to help absorb excess liquid and bind better. Fell apart to much while cooking and eating.

Amazing Recipe.  I added 2 hot red peppers when chopping vegetables and a little more spice in the eggs, and it took 1 cup of bread crumbs to get a good consistency, but these were absolutely yummy.  Still a bit crumbly but it didn't matter at all.  I served them with a sauce made of low fat sour cream and hot curry spice mixed together.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!!!

These are absolutely the BEST veggie burgers I have ever had.  I totally recycled my other recipe!  I made only two minor changes - I did not have any mushrooms and didn't feel like running to the store.  We didn't miss them at all.  I also only added one egg - I thought the consistency was perfect without adding another.  This recipe ended up making 8 burgers, just the perfect size for our whole wheat buns, and am planning on freezing the remaining six.  My husband and I give these a super thumbs up and can't wait until they are dinner again!

Very good recipe for black bean burgers, hence the four stars, but I think I’m about to give up my quest for bean burgers and admit that we just don’t like them that much, which is not a reflection on this recipe at all.  I did expect the recipe to be a bit spicier and flavorful than it was, but I used a lot more bread crumbs, well over a cup, and cut back on the cumin, so maybe that is why.  I once made a recipe that called for a lot of cumin and it didn’t agree with me.  At six servings, the cumin in this recipe is one-half teaspoon per burger.  Also, the burgers were huge.  Which was fine, just FYI.

These were great burgers! I followed the recipe exactly except for putting 1 can black beans and 1 can garbanzo. I thought the flavor of the seasoning was good. I gave 4 stars because of the consistency and the yield amount. The patties were very soft so I added 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs instead of the 1 cup so that they would hold up nice. Also, I doubled the batch because I was making these for a get together and I ended up with 22 burgers!! I only needed 12. So the rest are going in the freezer. The adults liked the burgers, but none of the kids did. All in all it's a good recipe and I will make these again.

As per usual, I started cooking a recipe without all the ingredients. But, as not per usual, it came out really tasty.

Basically, I substituted garbanzos for the black beans and horseradish for the hot sauce. It looked lovely, what with all the colors of the gold garbanzos, green bell peppers, and brown mushrooms. It was a bit of a challenge to flip them--I had about a  50% success rate--so I would suggest making sure they are really done on the one side first and only flip once. Other than that, they had a great flavor.

We topped ours with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and a little more horseradish sauce (I love that stuff). Baked sweet potato fries and sliced peaches on the side.

These were fantastic!  Best burgers ever!  With leftovers, I broke the patties up the next day and used them like falafel in pitas (used the Peppy's Pita Bread recipe from this site) with some spinach and cheese... delicious!

This recipe rocks! My first time making veggie burgers and they were soooo good! The mix itself before you cook it even smells great! I pulsed the beans in a food processor to save time but next time I will pulse one or two times less so they're stiffer. I used red pepper and pan cooked up the burgers too. Also, my mix made 8 patties when I used a half cup scoop and a patty mold!

We really enjoyed these but I, too, wound up having to add a LOT more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for and don't know why as I followed all directions exactly as written.    Other than that, no issues and we loved them (although the kids weren't quite as crazy about them)!  Also, I'd recommend cooking the rice according to package directions as I walked away from mine after setting the timer for the amount of time listed and wound up having to make new rice....lol.    We'll definitely be making these again!

Very easy to make but takes a little time but it is definately worth it....Tastes GREAT! I made a few minor changes but pretty much followed the recipe.  I added some corn and cut back on cumin and chili powder but added some cajun seasoning.  I did have to add more breadcrumbs and I did drain and rinse the black beans and dried them off, also drained the pepper and onions after finely chopping.  This makes plenty I'm so happy now I can freeze them and have them anytime! Thanks I loved them.

These were very good.  The first time I made these I cooked them as stated on the bbq and it didn't work well at all for me.  The second time I cooked them on my electric skillet and it was so much easier.  Kids loved them too!

My vegetarian friends loved these when I made them! I made a few substitutions, as we all do, and used baby portobello mushrooms instead of regular, a yellow pepper vs. a green for sweetness, and black beans with chilies vs. regular for extra kick.   When making the mixture, I definitely had to work in more than the listed amount of breadcrumbs to get these burgers to stay together... before grilling, I coated each in a light layer of olive oil a dusting of breadcrumbs. It helped keep their shape a little bit better.   Awesome recipe!

These are pretty good.  I cooked them in the oven because they weren't holding together very well.  After I cooked them, they were still falling apart, but after letting them cool, they held together better.  I might play around with the spices next time, not sure I like cumin.

Wow! This really is the best of everything! I adjusted the amount of bread crumbs to get the right consistency, but otherwise followed all measurements.  I was so impressed with the flavor! I made these for a cookout, and even some of the meat-eaters chose this over beef.  Thanks for the recipe :)

These were very good!  I used ground flax and water as egg replacer (2 tbsp flax, 6 tbsp warm water for 2 eggs), precooked frozen brown rice  and omitted the cheese.  I had large cloves of garlic so I only used three and I can't say I used exact measurements for the spices, but in the end it tasted right.  I found the patties very easy to work with and they held together nicely, but the centers of the burgers were still pretty mushy, almost like a bean dip.  Next time I'll add more bread crumbs or maybe try it with the cheese to see if that helps.  But like I said, flavor was excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked these veggie burgers better than any other ones that I have ever tried. I  would have given it 5 stars the but the consistancy was too wet I had to keep adding more and more bread crumbs to make it work. I have made this a few times now and I add rolled oats to make them thicker. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used the food processor to blend the black beans instead of mashing them by hand. I don't have a grill so I had to bake the burgers, and they needed about 15 minutes per side instead of 10 minutes like the recipe calls for. Also, I was able to make 8 decent sized patties instead of 6 as the recipe calls for. I served it with mashed avocado like some other reviews suggested. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

Excellent veggie burger.  Even non-vegetarian friends love it.  I only had half a green pepper last time I made them which was fine; also used half a large onion; did not add mushrooms; and reduced ground cumin to 1 tsp.  This is going to be a recipe I use often.  It made 8 medium burgers.

I love this recipe! My first attempt at a vegi burger and I will be sure to make them again! My only change next time will be to cut back on the bell pepper just a bit. It took me a little longer to prepar than I thought it would, but I think that's just because I dont own a food processor and had to do it all by hand. Now if i could justget m kids to eat it... :)

This is a hearty veggie burger. They tasted really good, but no asked for seconds.  This recipe makes a lot. Next time I would freeze the leftovers for later.

Yummy! Tinkered w/ a bit-they were super wet so we didn't grill but cooked in higher than recommended oven and nearly double the time. Made few changes based on what was on hand or taste: used whole grain pilaf and a small cold baked potato in place of brown rice. Used 1 can each pinto & black, about 1/4 an onion, no garlic & nearly double bread crumbs as they weren't holding together. Served open w/ sliced avocado, melted mozzarella, and fresh pico. Yum!

Like everyone else I tweaked this. They turned out wonderful. Here are the changes I made.
I sautéed the following vegetables in a nonstick pan in 1/3c  olive oil.
1/2c matchstick carrots
1/2c combined diced red and green peppers
2cloves diced garlic
1/3c combined diced onions and green onions
Added 1packet of Sazon Goya seasoning(with coriander&annatto)cooked just to soften.

I did not process or mash nothing. The black beans I just drained and rinsed, I also baked 6 slices of whole wheat bread cooled and ground up to use for bread crumbs(about 4cups). Start out with 2c then add if needed.
I combined all the original ingredients minus spices,eggs,hot sauce,mushrooms,and water. Also the rice was 1 1/2c. But it will be a personal preference. Mixed my ingredients together in large bowl and added the following 1container of Sabra roasted red pepper hummus. I did not have to add any liquids not even the requested cup of water also I had bought some matzo meal and added 1/2c to the mixture. It was the perfect consistency (like meatloaf). Made 12 burgers cooked 2 in nonstick pan on the stovetop, the rest in 375 degree oven for 15-20 min. Seasonings was a dash of liquid smoke and a shake of Cajun spice. Used a olive oil cooking spray on the cooking sheet to bake. My husband who is a meat and potato man ate 2 and took 2 more to work to share with a co-worker.

the recipe size is huge and the burgers were mushy. i made them really thin. the taste is amazing would make again just not use the food processor so everything can be chunky and hopefully not be mushy.

These veggie burgers taste great!  They take a little time to make but I bake them all, then freeze the extras and they reheat perfectly on the grill.  Worth the effort.

These were the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted.  I did not use as much chili powder & hot sauce as the recipe called for.  I used a little more breadcrumbs.

The only thing missing is a zingy topping sauce.  I tried mixing plain yogurt, cumin, garlic & lime.  It was really good!

Okay I royally screwed up somewhere. The green peppers were a were a dominating flavor that I didn't like and the spices were weird afterwards. and it all tasted off. I used a little food processor, could have just chopped them, but. I also used a george foreman grill 'cause it's quick, but they stuck and didn't cook all the way through, I think change the spices to what you like and fry it in a pan for tacos or burritos, but I think I also didn't really like the rice too, probably all beans would have been better.

It came together a little wet even though I kept adding bread crumbs.  I was afraid to make them dry by adding too much bread crumbs but I think it's fine because I don't want a dry burger.  The flavor is great.  I adjusted the heat to my liking and didn't end up adding the hot sauce.  Maybe I'll be more adventurous next time.  The recipe ended up yielding 12 burgers.  I cooked them in a frying pan about 7 minutes per side, until golden brown on medium heat.  They were about 1/2" thick and I cooked them in a little oil.  If you make them too large (I first attempted making them to fit a regular bread slice) they are hard to flip because they break.

These are pretty good!  Could use a little more 'bite' for me, so I will likely add fresh hot pepper next time.  I think, too, that this will be one of those easily adaptable, use-up-the-leftovers type recipes.  I didn't have mozzarella, so used just enough freshly grated parm for flavor. I also used 1/4 quarter each of red, yellow, and orange bells.  I actually ended-up with 8 fairly large patties.  I think, too, that those sensitive to eggs or eating vegan could possibly skip the egg step--mine were patty-making consistency after the cheese step.

Too much cumin for my taste and I couldn't get the burgers to cook all the way through.  I added the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs suggested but they obviously need a lot more to not be soggy in the middle.

Really good veggie burger with lots of flavor. I didnt want to wait for my rice to cook so I substituted some leftover oatmeal from breakfast. It turned out great! I made a bunch and put them in my freezer for a quick meal.

overall good. i baked mine - patties were too flimsy to flip, so i never flipped them - it was still ok. i followed this recipe and ended up with 12 big patties - 1/2 cup each, so, i dont know how this recipe only yielded 6...and my cans of beans were only 15 oz, not 16, and i forgot the garlic - so...something is a bit off...

These were fantastic!  I substituted the mozzarella for some spicy vegan cheese and the egg for vegan egg substitute, but other than that stayed true to the recipe.  My meat-eating husband wants me to make them again.  I only wish they held together better in the frying pan, although they did very well on the grill.

These burgers were HUGE!  I thought about halving the recipe and was sorry I didn't.  I baked them and it took longer to cook than the directions said. They tasted pretty good, but more hassle than they were worth in my opinion.

Just finished sampline one. These were ok to me. My vegetarian boyfriend really loved it! But others kinda had mixed reviews-they felt something was missing.  I use cayenne pepper instead of hotsauce. My blender seemed to malfunction so I used a potato masher to crush the beans. I added seasoning to my brown rice while it cooked (goya adobo, lawrys) like how I cook regular rice. Also I added the cumin seasoning directly to the beans after I mashed them.  I wished the texture was more sturdier. Maybe I shouldve drained the mixture of onions and bell peppers (was kinda watery) or perhaps fry/grill instead. I also made smaller ones for breakfast. I had to add more bread crumbs, but it kept really well in the freezer. All in all, its a great recipe-just need to tweak it a bit. No one I know eats veggie burger without lettuce, etc..so I cant wait to try these with them.

I made these for my boyfriend & I (both meat & burger lovers) when we were looking for something different.  They were tasty and we both enjoyed the southwest flavor to the burgers.  We left out the shredded cheese and ate with a slice of swiss instead. Also omitted the onions & green pepper.  My only thought was that they were slightly too salty and I would cut back on the garlic salt and perhaps try adding chopped jalepeno for some zip in the future.

These were fantastic. I baked them with excellent results. They didn't all hold together well, but most turned out perfectly. I can't wait to try making them on the barbecue this summer!

Really great veggie burgers that both my husband and I enjoyed and we are both normally meat eaters!!  I halved the recipe because it was just the 2 of us and ended up still making 5 burgers out of it.  Was really delicious and would have been even better topped with avocado.  Yumm!!!!

Great recipe!!  With a vegetarian daughter who get tired of frozen conveinence food and a husband with high cholesterol, you couldn't ask for a tastier "burger".  We substituted a light pepper jack cheese.  Delish!

I made these for my dad and I to eat while he was visiting, and he absolutely raved about them!  I thought they were very good too, but not being a big black bean person, I'm going to try cutting the black beans in half and doubling the egg on the next go-round.  Actually, I use Egg Beaters so it ends up being a very low cholesterol burger too.  These burgers also refrigerate and re-heat beautifully, so the leftovers are great too!

While I was making these veggie burgers, I was just hoping they tasted as good as they smelled...well, they tasted even better.  This was a great recipe, and I will definitely be making these again.  I didn't have the bell peppers, the mushrooms, or the mozzarella cheese, but substituted carrots, corn, and a mix of cheddar cheeses.  Somehow, even with following the recipe, I ended up with 11 burgers...all the better, more for leftovers!  Thanks for sharing this one!

This is the veggie burger I’ve been searching for since we became vegetarians. I subbed olives for mushrooms and dried beans in oven for a few minutes before mashing. They took a bit longer to cook, but they’re going to be a staple in our house. I made extra to freeze.

Good flavor but I wasn’t happy with the texture.  The burgers stuck  to aluminum foil even with Pam.   I’ll make it again but I’ll reduce the moisture & use a hotter grill.

this was very flavorful.. i had mine plain and also with some greek yogurt.. bf had a bite of my plain patty and said it tasted good but didn't remind him of a burger.. he said he'd be willing to try this in a bun with lettuce and tomato and give a final review.. that being said i made a few changes taking a lot away from Tammy Zuch's review.. i didn't use a food processor.. i just chopped the veggies and sauteed them in a bit of olive oil before adding it to the beans that i mashed with a potato masher.. mixed everything together and put it in the fridge overnight.. i baked these the next day and am looking forward to buying some buns for bf to give this another shot.. ty for the recipe

Oh man, finally a veggie burger that sticks together!! This recipe is awesome. I used Tasty bite brown rice and lentils so I didn't have to cook brown rice from scratch to speed up the process. I also used gluten free breadcrumbs which I needed more than 1/2 cup because they don't absorb as much moisture as regular. You really have to eyeball it when you are thickening it up! I used egg whites instead of eggs which worked fine as a binder! Now my favorite burger, thank you for this recipe! I pan fried it, and oven baked them, both methods were great.

It was my first time making veggie burgers and it turned out great. I did bake the black beans in the oven at 350 for 20 mins to dry them out a bit. I also chopped everything rather than a food processor for more texture. I sautéed the veggies for five minutes to bring out the flavor. I used 3 eggs as I didn't measure the peppers or mushrooms and it needed a bit more moisture to stick together. I found it easier to use a hamburger press with wax paper to form the patties. I threw them in the frig for 3 hours to firm up. It only took 8-10 minutes for each side in a pan with olive oil. I will be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe.

The middle was too spongy for both of us.  I may try them again however I would make the burgers much thinner and add more seasoning.

I followed the recipe exactly. While the end result was very tasty, it did not firm up at all. I baked the patties at 425 for 30 minutes and they became very hot mush and did not hold their shape at all. It was more like dry veggie Sloppy Joes than burgers.

My husband and I decided to make these to make up for our favorite burger cart closing down. These are so delicious! We were able to make 7 GIANT burgers with this recipe. We needed to add about 1 cup more breadcrumbs than were called for.  When baking we added about 10 more minutes to each side.  These are so delicious with avocado and tomato.
