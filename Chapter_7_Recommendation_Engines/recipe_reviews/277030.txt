Absolutely delicious! I was worried that it would not turn out since the batter was extremely thick and sticky. Glad I wrong. I chose to poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze over the cake. This resulted in a very moist cake. I could not however taste the salt in the caramel. Next time I will up the salt to 1 tsp. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
