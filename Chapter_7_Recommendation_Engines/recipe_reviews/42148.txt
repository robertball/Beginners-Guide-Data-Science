I LOVE this recipe. I have used this recipe so much (sometimes modified with a bit more sugar) and it never fails me.  Its always moist and delicious.  It is hearty- definitely not like those "air" boxed cakes.  A tip for those that find the cake to grainy or dry:  Don't use cake flour! Use all purpose! Put a little more milk in for desired consistency and moistness and by all means when mixing the butter and the sugar together go as long as 10 minutes or until it is smooth.  The smoother the butter and egg are the less grainy it will be!

Not to toot my own horn, but this recipe never lets me down.  To ensure proper moistness, I'll sometimes add 1/8 to 1/4 cup of a light oil to the batter before baking (especially if the relative humidity is a little on the dry side).  I hope you'll find easy, versatile this recipe as tastey as my family and I do.

I was about to give up on making cakes from scratch until I came across this recipe. This one turned out bakery style moist. I used 3 eggs instead of two and creamed them along with the butter and sugar for 10 minutes. AngieMonty was right,the smoother the butter mixture,the smoother the cake. I also used cake flour and whole milk and baked it in round layers for exactly 40 minutes,the least amount of time called for. I frosted it with chocolate frosting and it disappeared in record time. I have found my cake recipe. Thanks Scottley!!!

Oh, my…in my experience this is quite possibly one of the better white cake recipes I’ve tried.  In fact, I’d call it perfect, with no need to change anything let alone search for a better recipe. If you follow the directions and cream the butter and sugar to aerate the batter and give it lift, if you add the eggs one at time to keep the batter emulsified, you will get fantastic results, a superior cake.  But I think that maybe some inexperienced bakers, wanting to make sure they do it right and “beat the heck” out of the butter and sugar, might actually take it too far – you CAN overbeat a cake batter!  The cake is only lightly sweet, but I liked that.  I don’t know who would plan to eat this without a rich, sweet frosting, and the two together create the proper creamy, moist, fluffy, sweet lusciousness you want.  (And I’m not exaggerating for effect) This is light with a tender crumb – if you need a cake for sculpting or carving this would NOT be a good choice. But if you want a fluffy, light, stick-to-your-fork moist white cake, give Scottley’s a try.  I baked this as cupcakes – one-half recipe makes 12 perfect cupcakes.  Bake at 350 degrees, 18-20 minutes.

This is the best scratch yellow cake recipe I have found so far! I gave it a try despite seeing some poor reviews and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a cake decorator always looking to improve on the cakes I make, and this recipe is my new found winner. I was not disappointed, especially when my customers compliment the cake. I would suggest for the ones who gave this a poor review to give the recipe another try.

This is a very simple recipe and turns out very well.  I am not sure why some people have had problems with it.  Just a note....all milk is not the same.  If you use a skim milk, the cake will be less rich than if using whole milk.  I used skim milk and margarine rather than butter.  Butter provides a better flavor, but margarine creams better and incorporates more air into the batter.  My layers only took 30 minutes to bake...maybe some people over-cooked the cake.  As mentioned by another evaluator, the toothpick method is the only sure way of checking for doneness.  I do want to mention that if this cake tastes like a cornbread, then honey, you need to try REAL cornbread.  Most restaurant cornbread and box mixes taste like cake.

I tried this recipe because the items for the recipe were already in my kitchen.  I was really surprise how moist and flavorful the cake turn out.  I know I will continued to make this cake.

I had given up on fiding a "from scratch" cake recipe that was moist and delicious - and then I found this recipe!! 

I only gave it four stars because I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I added two tablespoons of vegetqable oil, an extra egg and a small envelope of instant vanilla pudding mix.  

I've made this recipe twice and my friends can't stop raving about them!

I used Wilton's recipe for Buttercream Icing with meringue powder to ice them.

This is NOT an appropriate receipe for most layer cakes.  With a little extra sugar it would probably make an excellent pound cake.  The batter is extremely heavy, and even after adding a little additional oil and milk, the final result was rather dry and consistent with a pound cake after cooling.

This was the best yellow cake ever.  I'll never buy a box yellow cake again.  I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose.  I'll try again and use cake flour but it is great with all purpose.  Thanks.

This is a great base for a cake. I did make modifications and this cake turned out fabulous. Based on other reviews I creamed the butter and sugar very well with a mixer, and then I whipped it pretty good after adding the eggs (1/2 cup egg beaters instead of eggs). I also added 1 small pouch of pudding (any flavor that you want your cake to taste like.) I also added more milk, I could not imagine how dense the cake would have been without it, I added probably 1/2 - 3/4 cup more milk and then a splash of olive oil. Thanks to the other reviews for their suggestions!!

This yellow cake was very flavorful, but mine came out a little dry.  I never have that problem, but I will try reviewers' suggestions and use all-purpose flour and a little extra milk next time.

my first from scratch cake and it came out fantastic!  Great flavor, very easy and not a lot of complex ingredients.  Had to bake an additional 15 min. but that may be due to the altitude where I live.  Highly recommend this recipe and will be using this one again! :)

I love this recipe. I used it for cupcakes and they were awesome. They were light and fluffy and the tops were just a little crunchy. I will, definitely, use this recipe many more times in the future.

Delicious!! I used this because I needed a cake that used less than 4 eggs. This was even better than the 4 egg cake! I will keep this for sure! Light, moist, easy and tasty! I had to stop my boys from eating it all in one go!

Terrific recipe!! I made this with Splenda instead of sugar for a party where none of us can eat sugar...and everyone raved about it. I'm making it again for another party.

Wow!  Glad I tested this recipe before I gave it to my co-worker for his going away party.  He might have been insulted and thought I actually wanted him to leave if I served this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  I guess my search for a good yellow cake continues.

When I was making this cake, I thought this batter is awfully thick. I baked it, let it cool. This was very dense. So dense that I bought a cake for the birthday party at work. It tasted good, but I wont make it again.

Really liked this recipe! Turned out light and moist. I used 1 stick butter and 1 stick margerine and creamed them with the suger for probably about 10 min. like other reviewers suggested.  I used the cake flour as listed. I mixed in the flour and milk in by hand (meaning didn't use electric mixer) and tried not to over-stir. I did use 3/4 cup of flour because some people said they didn't think it was sweet enough. Might try adding some dry pudding mix to the recipe next time, just to see what that does.

I am sooo impressed with this recipe!  I tried baking cakes from scratch before, but they never quite came out right.  This cake is moist, fluffy and delicious.  It didn't stick to my pans at all (which most boxed cake mixes usually do).  I took the suggestions of others and used 3 eggs/all purpose flour.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  I always have the ingredients on hand, so this will be standard cake mix.  Thanks so much Scottley!

I used this recipe for my very first cupcakes with strawberry frosting. It turned out well as I didn't expect it to have sponge cake or angel food cake texture.

I made it exactly the way the recipe is written. The cake was done after 30 minutes of baking and it tasted awful. Back to the drawing board for a good recipe for Yellow Cake!

In an effort to avoid box cakemixes and their hydrogenated fats I tried this recipe.  OMG!  It turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using half and half instead of milk.  I find my oven bakes "hot" so I checked at 25 minutes (9.5" pans) and the toothpick came out clean.  I will definitely be making this cake again! Happy birthday to my son with a winner of a bday cake.

This recipe did not work for me.  My 1st scratch cake and I'll stick to Dunkin or Betty from now on. I used all purpose flour because I didn't know there was 'cake' flour and that is the only variation. Sounds like some tweakers had success though.  I would not advise for 1st time baker. Heavy and Dry :(

I hadn't attempted to make cake from scratch for about 10 years and was finally ready to try again so as to avoid the box of chemicals. I have made this recipe several times now. The first time I made it without any changes. It tasted good but it was dry and cornbread like. 

Since then, I add more milk and extra vanilla. I also reduced the bake time by 5 or 10 minutes depending on my oven. The taste and texture was 100% better. Next time I will try this in a 9x13 pan and cut the bake time by another 5 minutes. Then it should be perfect!

I always make this cake with the following 2 recipes found on this site:
Quick and Almost Professional Buttercream Icing 
http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Quick-and-Almost-Professional-Buttercream-Icing/Detail.aspx

And 

The filling from Almond Cream Puff Ring

I'm afraid this recipe didn't turn out well at all- the cake tasted stale and dry an hour after it was baked, and it was quite hard. I wouldn't use this one again.

This is the best yellow cake ever. I looked at the reviews before I made it and saw one that mentioned using an extra egg to make it moist. I love a moist cake and used 3 eggs instead of 2. It didn't last 1 whole day. Dessert after dinner in lunches the next day and not enough for everyone to share the 2nd night.

Great cake.  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and added 3 eggs instead of two.  I used this recipe to make cookies n cream cupcakes.  I reduced the flour to 2 1/4 and added about 10 crushed oreos.

I found that this cake was a good base for other things. My son's favorite is pineapple upside down. If you relace 1/3 cup of milk with blendded pineapple, and do the normal buter sugar and pineapple bottom it comes out great.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday and everyone thought I bought it from a bakery. The best part about this cake would have to be the texture of the batter and the cake and the taste!!! Keeping this recipe forever.

yummy and easy - I added a box of french vanilla instant pudding to the butter and sugar and omitted the vanilla extract. It came out moist and delicious, perfect for the strawberries I had planned for it :)

I always bake pound cakes and I'm just a beginner but this cake was awesome. Just got it out of the oven and had a piece and I have to say that it was a really nice texture. I changed a couple of things, thanks to other reviews and added 1 and a half cups of almond milk instead, used all purpose flour and salted butter instead of salt and butter. I can't wait to let my friends try it.....

first of all i'd like to say, i've used many wonderful recipes from allrecipes and this is the first time i've ever left a review. this cake recipe is phenomenal and it's still in the oven! i've never baked a cake from scratch and i have never been inclined to eat raw cake batter, i could not stop licking the bowl! ok, i wanted to follow this one to a 'T' but I had to make some subs: didn't have milk so I used suggested amount half and half. also I didn't have cake flour nor a flour sifter so I used all purpose flour. eggs and half and half were cold (not room temp, as suggested by another reviewer. aside from that, i softened the butter (not marg) in microwave, creamed really well with the sugar, added eggs one at a time, added in vanilla and then blended in half and half. dumped in all dry ingredients, stirred with a spoon, then whisked for 5 minutes. it just came out of the oven and looks amazing. did i mention that the batter was outrageous?! i read all the other reviews and could not for the life of me figure out how people could get so excited over a cake! but now i know- im a believer, Scottley, you rock!!! 
UPDATE: just had a piece... i will never used a box again!!

This was my first cake baked from scratch and it was a success!  I followed the suggestions made by other members and added 1 extra egg and 1/4c of milk and it turned out great!  I love how it has that light sweet taste - my husband and I cannot stop eating it and we both agreed we could have it WITHOUT any icing/filling because it already tastes good by itself.

I only gave 4 stars because I was hoping for it to be much "fluffier", maybe I over-mixed it like the previous reviewer said.

This recipe is easy and will definitely use this as my base recipe for future cake projects!  Thank you so much Scottley!

I have never been able to successfully make a cake from scratch until I found this one. The recipe was simple and easy. To ensure moistness I added a tablespoon of oil. I also brushed on a simple syrup made with sugar, water, and lemon zest which gave it added flavor

Perfect because I had all the ingredients when I felt like baking cupcakes! First time making yellow cake from scratch and I'd have to say it was pretty easy! 

I used 1 extra egg like some suggested. And instead of a round cake I did a pan of mini cupcakes and 21 regular sized cupcakes. I'm not sure why, but when the mini cupcakes came out, there was a pocket of air at the bottom of the cupcakes. So the mini's came out even smaller than the cupcake paper. My husband thought they were a bit dry, but I think they were fine. I'm not sure if it's because it didn't have the usual cake-y consistency/texture, but I thought they were fine! Perhaps it was that I used 2% milk instead of whole milk? I'd try it again though!

I cut this recipe in half and baked in in a round non-stick tie pin, sprayed with coconut oil. Other than that, i used one-half of 1/3 C. of (very thick) homemade buttermilk (and the rest was just milk; I think a little yogurt replacement would have the same effect as the buttermilk). I kept in in the oven for about 33 minutes at 350 and it came out moist and VERY yummy, neither under- nor overcooked. My 2-year-old was on the upswing from a tummy virus so I made this at his request as soon as he asked. And now he's requesting more. This is just great, and I'll definitley use it again.

I made this cake for Christmas. I modified it alittle by adding instant vanilla pudding.The batter whipped up nice and fluffy. The cake was good, but not as moist as I wanted it to be. Next time I will add more milk.

I wanted to make a plain yellow cake to layer under strawberries & whipped cream. This is it! I so dislike what passes for cake in stores and mixes. Too much sugar and chemical taste.
I made half the recipe, but kept it at 2 eggs and only put in 1/2 cup of sugar (that would be a cup for a whole recipe).
It was perfect. I don't need all that sugar in the cake since I'm putting sweet stuff on top anyway.
This is going in my top ten desserts. It is easy to make (not a lot of prep time) and it tastes like cake did when I was a kid. Thanks for a great old-fashioned recipe.

I added a tad bit of vegetable oil for moistness but the "heavy belly" cake rocks. And the recipe was easy to follow especially for a box cake pro like myself.

I was very happy with the way this cake turned out. Great with chocolate frosting. It does taste slightly cornbread-like, but this does not take away from the taste. I used about a 1/2 cup more milk at the end, but otherwise the recipe was perfect!

I made this tonight in a 13x9x2 pan.  I think I may have underbaked it just slightly - it was pulling away from the sides and browning on top at 40 minutes, so I took it out.  I think it could have used another few minutes.  It's very moist, with a rather coarse crumb and an excellent flavor.  I would make this cake again.

I am sure that I did something wrong but I ended up with the layers looking like cornbread.  I substituted Splenda for the Sugar and added some powdered milk in addition to everything else called for and it was too dry.  In spite of all that, it tasted wonderful.  Since I am diabetic, I served one layer of the cake with no sugar added Apricot Jam, and iced the other with a sour cream icing.  It really was enjoyable but I will add a little more liquid next time.  I am just learning to cook with Splenda so I should do better next time.  Barbara

This cake was delicious. I think anyone who thought it wasn't sweet enough must be used to the overprocessed, over sweetened box cakes. I made it as a 9x13 and baked it about 35 minutes. It was very light in texture and I may use half cake flour next time if I were going to do it as a layer cake. I often make 9x13 cakes though and this will be my standby for a yellow cake. Super easy and anyone who wants to get away from the chemical laden box mix cakes, this would be an ideal place to start. A definite keeper. I used this frosting and it was oh so scrumptious. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Creamy-Chocolate-Frosting/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=chocolate%20frosting&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page&soid=sr_results_p1i1

This was a great, simple recipe. No complaints. I might add a little sugar next time and a tad more vanilla. Very light and fluffy. Definitely a keeper. Thank you soo much for sharing!

This is an exellent alternative to a box mix! Its simple to make, looks a beautiful golden brown color when done. The taste isnt out of this world, but still pretty good as is, and is really moist. It has a dense texture, while still feeling fairly light to eat. I made into a 9x9 square cake, and 12 cupcakes. Topped with a Nutella buttercream. Yum!

The flavor was okay, but not exceptional.  My major problem was that mine came out tough and a little dry.  I didn't use cake flour however, and I realize that this may have been part of the problem.  I may have overmixed it as well, but I really didn't mix it that much, perhaps slightly beyond when it came together.  
I made it into a layer cake because I saw that several other people had, however it cracked a bit.  
The best thing about this cake was that it was easy to frost, not all crumby and fragile on the outside like many cakes are.  
Also, it stuck to the pan a bit and I lost a chunk of one of the layers.

I always get rave reviews when making this recipe.  I can't count the number of times I've been told it's the best cake someone has ever had.  It's great for sheet cakes or as layers.  A nice rich buttercream, either chocolate or vanilla, pairs nicely with it.  Be sure to sift the dry ingredients together.  Otherwise, it can be very dense.  But even then, it tastes marvelous.  It's my go-to cake!

I cut back on the vanilla extract by a teaspoon and added a teaspoon of pure almond extract. Other than that, I kept everything else the same. I baked my cake in a greased 9x13 baking pan. Baked at 350*, my cake was done in just under 40 minutes. This turned out absolutely perfect. No complaints. The boys loved it.

Very moist cake.  We used homemade buttercream frosting, it was so much better than the box, just as easy and definitely worth the calories!!!  We're going to use this recipe for a baby shower cake this week-end.

Excellent. I made with 1/3 cup oil instead of butter (probably would have been 5 stars with butter), all purpose flour, and soy milk. Light, fluffy, and delicious.

This cake is so perfect! It's not way too moist like other recipes, and leaves a light, sweet buttery aftertaste. It is lacking in the sugar department (almost like a teacake) but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like how it's not too sweet because the frosting makes up for it, and you can always add more if you want to. I followed the recipe exactly (though the second time I made it I added jimmies for a funfetti cake ;) ) I will continue to use this recipe again and again!

Wonderful cake!  I made cupcakes--the recipe as posted made 24.  I overbaked them a bit; 16-17 minutes probably would have ben perfect.  This will be my go-to yellow cake recipe.

The only changes I made to this recipe were using 1 1/2 cups icing sugar instead of the white sugar, and adding 1/4 cup milk to the batter. When I made this cake, it turned out pretty heavy. I really didn't expect that, as it is VERY humid where I live. Anyway, I was going to give this 4 stars because of the heavy batter, but I had a slice the next day, and OMG, it was SOOO good that I just had to give this 5 stars! I'll definitely make this again, maybe with an extra egg along with the 1/4 extra cup of milk. Thank you Scottley!

Yummy!!! Alittle dense but I had to adjust to what I had on hand and that could have attrbuted to that. I didn't have cake flour so I triple siffted all purpose. I bake in a 9x13 for about 35 mins. Would definitely try again.

I was looking for a cake from scratch recipe. I tried this recipe because it had rave reviews. I made it three times, and every time it was extremely dry. The comments that I got were that the taste was good, but it was too dry. I myself felt that it was too heavy (not light or airy) despite whipping the butter and sugar and sifting the flour. I do believe that this could be a good pound cake recipe or may serve as a "tres leches" cake base. I will try it again but will add more milk/water.

Amazingly moist and just the right amount of density! I cut the ingredients in half because all I had was one 10x10. Used 125 grams (a little over 1/2 cup) butter, since butter often comes in 250 gram blocks in Czech. and I just cut it in half. I also used 2 eggs and added one tablespoon of veggie oil since there were some comments about moistness. I also added a bit more sugar (less than 1/4 cup) because I forgot and added the sugar in with the flour mixture rather than with the butter as instructed, so I used it to help whip the butter. In my opinion it needed that extra sugar to be a little more sweet. I also don't have an electric beater yet so I let the butter reach room temperature and whipped it with a fork, it's hard work but it turns out just fine! I had some instant chocolate frosting and swirled it into the batter before baking, it came out perfect!

I made this cake for my granddaughter Lucy's baby shower. I will never make another box yellow cake again! gag. This was great ~ I beat the butter and sugar 10 minutes as another review said to do. this works nice. It can be a little dry, but one thing I do is take it out of the oven, let it cool slightly, and cover it good with plastic wrap and tin foil. Then I pop it in the freezer. That makes a moist cake every time. I made a "practice" cake before the shower and it was gone in 1 day. Thanks Scottley, for the wonderful recipe.

Great recipe. Nothing like corn bread. Great when you replace part of the milk with rum, and then cover the baked cake with a mixture of rum and butter! Also keeps really well, but the cup or rum probably contributed to that!

Very good basic cake recipe.  I too added a couple of teaspoons of oil and added extra milk and it came out nice and moist.  Since we are currently living in Africa and cake mixes are hard to come by, I will defenitely be using this recipe!  It's a keeper.

I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try the recipe, but I received many compliments. I also used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour, and made cupcakes. If you make cupcakes, keep an eye on them; there's a thin line between underdone and overdone.
******
Made them again for my brother's 18th birthday. I doubled the recipe then went with a 9x13 and an 8" 2-layer cake. Delicious! It's not dry in the sense of "dry," but it's not a moist cake either. There's not a strong yellow color, but it's natural-looking, and the vanilla comes through strong. Will use again and again.

Good the first day, a bit like corn bread, but not in a bad way.  With my fantastic buttercream frosting, it was great.  The next day, it was WONDERFUL!   My whole family loved it.

Thank you so much for a great recipe.  I made a large sheet cake with this recipe and it came out like a dream.  I took the advice of the other posters and made sure the butter was very light and fluffy, which I think is key.  My cake was visually stunning and super-tasty.  I admit I added some yellow food coloring to the batter because I wanted it really yellow!

Very nice cake.  I took previous reviewer's advice and really creamed butter & sugar a long time, about 8 minutes, used regular flour, and it came out great.  A little brown on the edges but the kids distracted me a bit. I'm going to halve this recipe, it would be great on its own with tea.

This cake is very tasty and fairly easy to make... except when you're trying to forst it. I let it cool completely but once I tried to put the frosting on it, it just crumbled to pieces! It was still very yummy but as far as appearance, it was a mess!

This cake wasn't bad.  I added about 1/8 cup oil to the recipe to make it more moist, and with a chocolate pudding frosting it was pretty tasty.

I was forbidden from baking as a kid because I made a logical leap trying to make biscuits with flour, water, and ranch and made ranch cookies. 
It's been over 25 years and it was my twin boys first birthday so my family lifted the ban so long as I promised to leave the ranch out. 

I didn't want to go in blind so I looked at a few recipes and decided to use this one mainly because I didn't have to separate the yolks and whites and mix separately. 
This cake is really good. It's not overly sweet so you can use American buttercream or cream cheese buttercream on it without feeling like your going into a diabetic coma. 
I did change it up a little, even though I know baking is more science than art. I added an extra egg and about half of a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. 
My butter was really soft so it only took about five minutes to cream, but if you have slightly firmer butter (as I did for the batch I made for cupcakes) it can take up to 10-ish minutes. Also, I made sure I stopped mixing just as the last of the flour was incorporated. 

Happy baking.

Very simple recipe with a yummy result!  I admit my idea of baking has always been to open a mix and pour it into a bowl, but since discovering a palm oil allergy, many cake mixes are off-limits to me now.  I was looking for a basic yellow cake recipe with simple ingredients and good flavor.  This delivered, and I’ll make it again.

I did make a couple of changes based on the reviews.  I added 1 more egg and an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  I creamed the sugar and butter thoroughly and blended the eggs and vanilla with them until the mixture was silky smooth and fluffy.

I just made this cake and it is fantastic! I was worried because of some of the reviews, but it couldn't have turned out better. Moist, great flavor, and beautiful. I don't know why some people are having trouble with it, but this will be my go to recipe for yellow cake from now on. I made a chocolate buttercream frosting and it's a perfect compliment.

I made this with gluten free flour and I only added a tablespoon of olive oil to change the recipe, as I usually have to increase the fat in any recipe I use GF flour in. This turned out light and airy, the sponge was perfect! It wasn't too sweet, I am going to experiment with adding different ingredients to tweak the flavor, like adding rosemary and lemon zest perhaps.

I baked this cake and it came out terribly. It is hard around the top and bottom and the inside is dry and not moist. Spent a lot of time trying to make this the right way and I don't know what I did wrong. Have never made a yellow cake I usually do chocolate cakes or cheesecake. I am not sure if I will ever try this again because it was for my husband's birthday and I am really disappointed in it.

This cake was very fluffy and moist but the flavor just didn't do it for me. It could have been my ingredients, but it tasted too buttery for my family's liking. If the flavor was there this cake would have been a 10.

excellent! Tasty and moist. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested mixing the butter and sugar for at least 10 minutes. The results were perfect. It is great that the folks share their tips. As old as I am I still learning something new.

I made this cake and it was moist and delicious. I love it and it was super good! If you have the chance, you HAVE to make it.

Made this cake according to the directions and it did not come out like a cake. More like cornbread! I re-read the ingredient list and instructions a second time to see if I missed anything but did not. Very doughy and not very sweet. When I mixed the dry and wet ingredients together it looked like pizza dough, not cake batter. Needless to say, it did not "pour" into the cake pans, even after I added more milk.

I followed this recipe exactly. The consistency of the batter was very thick. It turned out very dense which was not an issue but there was no taste.

This is a great recipe. I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour but it tasted fine. I've made it many times and enjoyed it in less than a day every time.

Excellent from-scratch cake! This is so much better than those boxed mixes (and to my frustration, when I searched for cake recipes, a number of the ones on this site had "a box of cake mix" as an ingredient... to me, that's not a real recipe! But I digress). I used it to build a "castle" birthday cake, and I think it was just fine as far as consistency - maybe a little soft for constructing something, but the taste was excellent and the consistency is perfect for eating or for the layer cake that's suggested.

This would make a very good base for a cake with fruit or something to add moisture. It rose fine but was very dense and heavy. It was more like a pound cake.

Never tried it with Vanilla, but have used Orange Extract with excellent results. An attempt with Lemon Extract was disappointing, but I think some lemon rind would fix that.

Great basic cake recipe though.

I made this exactly as is and I didn't like it.  The taste was ok, but it was too dry.  I brought it to church with me and no one asked to take a piece home.  This confirmed that the cake was not good.

It did not taste like yellow cake. It tastes more like a sugar cookie. It was very sweet . Although it did not taste like yellow cake, it was VERY VERY soft and moist.

I really liked this recipe! Doesn't look like anything special from ingredients, but it was moist and very tasty!! Quick and easy and had all ingredients in my pantry. I added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil last minute to the batter and it helped Im sure of it. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thank you!

It was an absolute hit! The directions were very easy to follow and took no time. The cake cooked up just right, not too dense, and the perfect sweetness.  In fact, I just made this tonight and my boys have made sure that it's already halfway gone!

UPDATE|. I made this cake again using cake flour.  The batter was much lighter but still very thick.  I used 9" pans this time.  The cake did not rise very much this time either.  The flavor was just as good.  So...I am still on the fence.  1st review:  I'm on the fence with this recipe.  The taste was good.  I whipped the butter and sugar (butter was room temp) until it was very very fluffy.  Next time I would not use 9" cake pans.  They turned out pretty flat.  The cake batter was VERY thick.  I was very hesitant.   With the exception of using all purpose flour, I followed the recipe to a T.  I will make again and will use cake flour next time.  Overall it was a good recipe---definitely better than a box mix.

OMgoodies. This cake could not be any moister. Perfect! Perfect! Perfect! The texture of this cake was like one purchased from a specialty bakery. It's one of those cakes that makes you wonder each time you take a bite, "how do they get it to be so moist"? Well darn-it I now know. For those complaining about it being too dry, it's because you're over mixing the batter. A hard cake is the result of over mixing even the best batter.

When i made this my mother and i were looking for something that wasn't a boxed cake for our Christmas dessert. I made chocolate frosting to go with it and it was the best cake we've had on our table in years. Everyone was pleased! Next i'm going to try using it to make a pineapple upside down cake.

I made this into cupcakes for my son's first birthday party. He loved it! For cupcakes I cooked them at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes and they were perfect. I got lots of compliments. Way better than boxed cake mix! I also used the "Butter Cream Frosting II" recipe here on allrecipes for the frosting. It was perfect!

Excellent basic cake recipe. A little on the dense side, but that's perfect for me because I was using it to sculpt a train cake for a birthday party. Simple, easy to make, and not too "eggy". Great recipe!

This turned out beautifully!  I made it for a pineapple upside down cake. I used 1/2c butter 1/2c shortening and added 3 tbsp of oil and creamed it for about 10 mins. Added eggs one at a time mixing well after each then fold in flour and milk careful not to over mix. I made this for a  family dinner, everyone was surprised at how good it tasted. This is a keeper!

I've made this many times, best yellow cake recipe I have ever found. I think using sifted cake flour gives the best result.. I hate sifting flour but it definitely makes a difference! Moist and fluffy cake, just how I like it! The most recent time I made this I added 1.5 tsp of vanilla (3.5 tsp total) to get a strong vanilla flavor. I like a strong vanilla flavor in my cakes, so this was the perfect amount. I made cupcakes, a full recipe makes 24 cupcakes, I baked for 27 minutes at 350, but I think my oven is not quite right, so this time may not work for everyone.

Awesome cake...I was craving cake and realized I didn't have any mixes so I searched for a recipe online and came across this one.  I just made it and it came out great, I don't know what other reviewers are talking about it being heavy and/or dry.  Mine came out perfect.  I added some coconut to the batter and I'm going to frost it with coconut frosting.  I'll never buy another yellow cake mix again!

I did NOT like this recipe.   I tried it out for a friends birthday cake and was sorely disappointed.  I will never use it again.  The flavor was off, it tasted more like a dry pound cake then a moist yellow cake.

This cake turned out very heavy and tasted like flour or bland like corn bread.  I won't make this again.

Well to be honest I haven't tasted it yet; but I rated this recipe a five because of the simple ingredients that I already have on hand. I had not plan to make a cake at 10:00 pm.  Yet here I am with a cake in the oven.  (Better than a bun :)))  Will finish the ratings tomorrow.

Outstanding! I took others advice and added extra sugar. Instead of 1 and 2/3 cups, I added two cups. I didn't have cake flour so I used white flour instead. I also used a bundt pan instead of two 9 inch rounds, which extended the cook time. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. In a word "YUMMY"! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe produces a nice, light, not too sweet yellow cake. Did not change a thing, creamed my butter and sugar for 10 min. The kids like the cake.
Although I have to say that I read the reviews before I made this cake, and I was laughing at the reviews that said this tastes like corn bread. But you know what, when I took that first bite, it DID taste like corn bread. And I make my cornbread from scratch. 
So, nice, fluffy cake, but I don't know why it tastes like corn bread. And I consider myself an experienced baker because I make cakes, bread, pie, cookies, etc all the time. Especially cakes.


Edited to add: when it just came out of the oven, the cake tasted like corn bread, after about 2 hours the cake cooled down and it does NOT taste like corn bread anymore. So I changed my rating to 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

Edited to add: I made this again and added 1 egg (3 eggs total) and 1/8 cup of vegetable oil. Much better.

Easy to make. I made a 9"x13" cake and it tested done but when I cut it open, it was sort of half cooked. It must have been something I did. Flavor and texture were great.

I'm going to use this for a cake decorating class and was very happy to see it fall right out of the pan with a nice level surface.  This was very simple to make and has an excellent flavor and texture.

I think this recipe is great.  I use it for basic cakes.  I have tried it with both regular flour and cake flour.  I prefer the cake flour as was originally required.

The flavor of this cake was nice, but I tried to make it twice and both times it ended up pretty dense and not sweet enough.   I'll try it again with some modifications.

The cake was really crumbly, and mostly dry rather than moist. It also tasted like cornbread without the frosting.

Made this today and this recipe was a hit with chocolate glaze drizzled over it.  My only modification was that I cut down on the sugar.  Will make again.

I made this and only cooked it for 35 minutes. It was already nearly over cooked to the point I had to cut the edges off before frosting. The cake isn't very "yellow" so I wonder if adding a third egg would help. Also, it's very fluffy and smooth but not particularly moist. It might be ok if you're adding a fruit filling but for a simple yellow cake I felt it lacked much flavor.

Thank goodness!  I have been trying to make cakes from scratch for a while and have not had much sucess until I found this recipe!  I followed the recipe but made a few small changes after reading the reviews.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2.  However, next time I might use only 2.  Instead of butter I used shortening.  Other than that I followed everything else as written.  I could tell right away that this cake was going to be light and fluffy!  I will be making this cake more often.  Yeah!

I made this cake for the second time, forgetting how disappointed I was the first time.  This cake has way too much flour, has no taste and is overall a big flop.  I had enough batter to make a two layer cake, and 12 cupcakes.  I think I will remember not to use this recipe again.  Used it only because it was the first recipe to come up when I search for a basic yellow cake and it did look to be quick and easy.  I cannot really even rate it to deserve one star.

I followed directions exactly! This cake turned out wonderful for frosting, and did not taste bad (nothing like cornbread, where do people get this?) The only thing I thought was wrong with it was how bland it was to me? But this maybe because I have never had, much less made a cake from scratch! My only suggestion would be to add more flavoring or sugar perhaps? I'm a new baker and do not know how to add sugar and flavoring without messing the whole thing up? Any suggestions?!?!

This recipe was just ok.  I was really looking for a great moist homemade yellow cake.  It gets really crumbly if you put it in the fridge. I probably won't make this again.

Wonderful cake!

I halved the recipe, added a bit extra milk, a little vegetable oil, and some brandy with the vanilla. Very dense yet fluffy. I slightly undercooked mine (I can't stand overbaked cake). Frosted with chocolate buttercream.

My husband loves this cake.  He keeps telling me he is on a diet. Then ask me to make this cake.

Sorry, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers -- this came out more like corn bread or a bland quickbread than a dessert cake.  It was quite heavy and coarse, and not sweet at all. I won't be trying this again, but to anyone who wants to I would suggest adding a lot more sugar.

I followed this recipe step-by-step, and I'm sorry to say this, but this yellow cake was way too dry, and tasted more like a corn bread gone bad, and was barely yellow. It was edible, but was not rich and moist like I expected it to be. I will definitely not try it again.
