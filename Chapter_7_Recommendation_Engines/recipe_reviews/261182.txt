I made these cookies using Splenda granulated because that's what I had.  The cookies are good, but the Splenda leaves an aftertaste.  Strangely enough, after spending a few days in the fridge, the aftertaste was almost gone.  I have since discovered, when comparing Swerve (Erythritol) to Splenda (Sucralose), that Splenda is about 30% sweeter.  So next time I bake these cookies with Splenda, I will use about 30% less.   That might help with the aftertaste.  Because it wasn't specified, I used unsalted butter.  Next time I'm going to try it with sated butter to see how that affects the flavor.   Also, I thought that 12.7 grams of carbs per cookie listed in the nutrition info was very high, so I did the research and crunched the numbers.  With Swerve there are 2.1 g of carbs per cookie.  With Splenda granulated, there are 3.1 g of carbs.  That makes more sense.

These cookies are quick and easy. They came out great, and have a light nutty cinnamon flavor! You can make them in any shape you want. I made little hearts.  Shape them 1/2" to 3/4" thick for chewy cookie, or shape dough to about 1/4" thick for a crumbly cookie. I'm going to use these cookies as a crust next time I make  keto cheesecake. YUM!

I made these as written.  The sweetener  I used was Organic Stevia Blend...a combination of Stevia and Erithrytol, the best sugars for a keto diet.  These are very good after a night in the fridge. Straight out of the oven or even cooled to room temperature doesn't seem to allow the flavors to come through. Also, the texture becomes more ' cookie-like' after refrigerating.  I will make these again when following a keto diet. Husband, who is NOT on keto diet, seems to like them too... he ate almost all my cookies.

I made these exactly as directed. I used Splenda no calorie artificial sweetener (the one that you use the equivalent amount to real sugar). If you like your cookies sweet, I suggest you use more than 1/2 cup. I don’t like things real sweet & I thought these were perfect. I did cook these for the minimal time & I made them slightly bigger than 1” because I like cookies really soft. Spray your fork with cooking spray before crisscrossing on cookies to avoid sticking. The only thing I might try next time would be to add a little almond extract. Overall, my husband & I both liked them very much. Which says a lot since he never eats or drinks anything with artificial sweetener in it!!

I made these delicious crispy cookies exactly according to the recipe except I baked them for 25 minutes in error and they still came out great! Maybe even better with the extra time? This is my new go to sweet treat while on a low carb keto diet.

Made last night, so simple. The sweetner I used was 1/3 Now brand Erythritol and 2/3 Betterleaf powdered Stevia, I dislike the cooling effect of Erythritol over slight bitterness of Stevia, first time I’ve split like that, read other recipes that suggested and it worked. I had neither effects from either one. Would like tad sweeter next time, I was just under measure on both sweetener because I was afraid it'd be cool/bitter with my concoction. I even cooked them in my toaster oven as my big oven is under the weather, came out perfect, didn’t flatten as in pic, even though I flattened as stated, but didn’t press with fork for two reasons, I wanted some volume so don’t get why you’d flatten them to begin with and also I was raised with the crossed fork press was only for Peanut Butter cookies growing up, so I’ma gonna keep it that way, seems everyone is fork pressing every flavor . My house smelt divine for hours after, I let them cool, kept one out and stored remaining in container in fridge, got more than 12, got 16. I used Costco almond flour, Kerrygold butter, Egglands Best Eggs from there as well, such a bargain. I could see where non-keto’ers would enjoy and not know. Also I prefer room temp or slightly warmed to bring out that warn cinnamon vibe. Great for the holidays or not, get an awesome cookie and with the smell of Christmas in the house, win-win. Happy Holidays y’all.

Loved it! I’ll use more stevia next time because I couldn’t hardly taste the sugar. Maybe 2/3 cup. I also added almonds, dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds to mine as a topping. Took only 10 mins to bake for me.

Loved these! I used Swerve Brown Sugar in the mixture and then sprinkled Lakanto Monkfruit golden sweetener with cinnamon on top, then I took some of the dough for a second batch and added unsweetened shredded coconut  and the cinnamon sugar on top and pressed this batch down with parchment paper and glass bottom. I baked them longer probably 18 minutes. Thank you for the great recipe!

I did like this recipe.  Although as a cookie, I felt it was lacking a little.  I do think I would prefer these as a thinner cookie, to get more of a crunchier texture.  I made them a little thicker, since I wasn't for sure if they would spread or not, and they had the mealy almond texture on the inside that I do not prefer.  They needed a little something extra, maybe a cream cheese frosting on the top or some nuts on the inside would be a good addition.  As the recipe is written, these would make an excellent low carb crust to a cheesecake, lemon bars, or other dessert.  I will be using this recipe as a crust next in my low carb desserts.  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe and left them in for 15 mins.  I added a Mac nut to top it off and add some crunch.  Next time I’ll do a few slivered almonds because I think that would really balance the yummy flavor and add just a little more crunchy texture that I prefer on a cookie.  This left them just a tad soft for me, but overall, yay a Keto cookie y’all!!

I made these. They didn't look as good as in the picture on here. though they were soft and good. The first bite was very good lots of flavor. the after taste wasn't as good. I used a cooking spray on the fork so the dough wouldn't stick as much. I will make these again.

This is the first keto dessert that I would say was a success. I used half a cup coconut flour in place of the almond and I added nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. These turned out very rich and battery, they actually held together which was a first for any recipe I’ve made with almond flour! I am excited to take these to work tomorrow, one of my friends is doing keto and she had also given up on desserts just like me.

I have made a few changes. Since I went keto, this is too sweet. I decreased the sweetener to 1/4c; I used monk fruit and I kept them in the freezer and enjoyed them frozen. YUM

just made these. they are not bad, don't know if i'd say they are good. think i made them to big, because they came out really soft & i am not a fan of soft cookies. they need something, but can't say what the something is. will make them smaller & squish them down more next time to see if i can get more crisp.

They tasted ok, a little grainy in texture. Mine spread out and didn't  crisp up even after 20 min of baking. Might try again.

These didn’t turn out like the picture but were very good and well liked by everyone. The almond flavour becomes stronger as they cool. I assumed almond flour can also mean almond meal. I baked for the suggested length of time. I preferred them less crispy than they were when I baked them longer.

I used real sugar for this recipe and should have used a little more, they weren’t quite sweet enough. I flattened some cookies and made sandwich cookies with cream cheese frosting in the middle and they were awesome. Since it’s almond flour the texture is a bit strange but everyone that tried them enjoyed them

horrible.  I expected them to be crisp, with all the butter and the almond flour...  they are limp and bland, with the aftertaste from the Swerve...  threw the whole batch out.

By far the best sugar-free cookies I've ever tasted. I cooked mine for 20 minutes and they turned out relatively crispy when cooled down. I used plain erythritol (no brand) and they turned out fine. Perhaps they could be a little sweeter but it's not necessary.  I look forward enjoying the cookies during christmas and sharing with my wife and kids :-)

Great recipe really tasty cookies. I used one snack size applesauce and 1/4 cup of butter to lighten the calories and they turned out great!  Thank you. My husband and I are just trying to start a keto diet but I’m trying to keep some treats in the house lol this was a great start

This was easy to make and the cookies are filling and tasty. I made the recipe as-is although I did take another person's suggestion of adding almond extract, about one tsp. The only thing I thought was it could use maybe a tiny bit more swerve because the sweetness level wasn't quite where I would like it. However I think maybe next time I might roll the balls in a cinnamon/truvia mixture, either that or do a light drizzled glaze made with confectioner's swerve, water and almond extract. We shall see.

After being low carb for 5 months we are trying different things. We made the cookies according to instructions and they were great. We plan on making them again

I made these because my adult daughter decided to go gluten free. She liked them. I thought they were "not bad" and will probably make them again. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.
