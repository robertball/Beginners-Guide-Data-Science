Made only half the recipe and it was still enough for 4 people. I used Hatch Chiles since they're in season and I just bought 25 lbs. It was just ok, more on the bland side. There was a bit of spiciness due to the chiles but other than that there was really no flavor. And Hatch Chile's are very flavorful.
