Yum! I did prepare the artichokes slightly differently. I thought the stuffing would get really soggy by the time the artichoke was fully done so I blanched the artichokes for 20 minutes over medium heat, removed and drained off excess water then cut off the stem and tops and removed the choke (the prickly center, do not remove heart). Then I mixed the remaining ingredients in a bowl and stuffed each artichoke with mixture, spreading leaves to stuff. Arranged them in pan with about 1 inch of water, covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 450 degrees then uncovered and baked 10 minutes more. Serve with a slice of lemon and sprinkled with more cheese and parsley. I would definitely suggest using olive oil or even butter in the recipe not just plain vegetable oil.

This is my dad's specialty, with a few changes! --->First, to make the stuffing use half Italian seasoned bread crumbs and half parmesan cheese with a little salt, pepper and one clove of garlic per choke.  Then, MOST important, DO NOT, I repeat, do not use vegetable oil!  You will make my poor Italian Nana spin in her grave!  Use extra virgin olive oil (look for it to say cold press on the label). Drizzle the oil over the top of the stuffed chokes and steam until done.  *~*How to eat the choke: Scrape the meat and stuffing off the leaves with your teeth until you get to the thin papery leaves.  At that point you take a knife and cut at an angle around the edge of the paper white leaves.  Take you fork and remove all the white feathery part and what you have left is the heart of the artichoke.  Cut that into bite size pieces and enjoy!

There are many variations to this recipe and this is a good one. Be "generous" when stuffing, separating the leaves with your fingers. Stuff the center as well as between the leaves. This takes patience. When simmering the artichokes may sure the globes all fit snuggly together in the saucepan. The key is to prevent them from toppling over so that you do not have a soggy mess. You want to steam them so that the bread crumbs and cheeses meld together (SEE MY PHOTO). Make sure you used the grated Romano cheese and not the kind in the green can. The latter will "clump up" and not melt. TY for the recipe!!  BTW, I used Italian seasonings instead and dipped the leaves in olive oil upon partaking.

I haven't seen any mention of the thick stems that are on the artichokes. I look for the longest stems and I peel away the outer skin and then chop them up and mix them  in the bread crumb and cheese mixture. What a treat! They get just as tender.Also I apply chopped garlic as well.Been making them for years.

These were soooo good although, I must delegate at least 2 of these stars to the other reviewers. I followed another users advice and boiled the artichokes for about 20 minutes so that I could scraped out the prickleys and the hairs. For the stuffing I substituded the italian bread crumbs for the cubed bread, much easier. Extra virgin olive oil trumps vegetable oil. Also, I added chopped pine nuts and basil. Then I stuffed and baked them in pan with about an 1 1/2 of water. Everyone LOVED them!

this recipe is excellent. It is how my great grandparents used to make them with just a couple alterations to make it easier for the cook and just as delisious. First, instead of using cubes of bread, use Italian style bread crumbs so then the seasonings of parsley and oregano are already in the bread crumbs so you don't have to add them. Second, slice the garlic very thin instead of mincing. The slices, if sliced thin enough melt into the artichoke as it steams.  Third, use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and just drizzle slowly over the stuffed artichoke after stuffing.  Fourth, use a mixture of parmesean and romano cheese to sprinkle over the top after the olive oil drizzle. This makes a wonderful kind of crust over the entire artichoke that is excellent!

This recipie is just like my grandma makes.  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of chopped up salami in the stuffing (like grandma).  I also used half chicken broth and half water with lots of garlic cloves to simmer them in. We use the juice to pour on them after.  
Thanks for helping me come close to home.

This is an excellent recipe for stuffed artichokes ("i carciofi ripieni") - a classic Italian dish whose proper preparation can at times be frustrating. An artichoke is the bud of a member of the thistle family. Tn the USA, global artichokes cultivated in California are those most frequently available . The really successful end result of a cooked, stuffed artichoke should provide leaves that are coated with almost homogeneously melted or amalgamated stuffing. However, all too often the end result may be disappointing. Although the heart of an artichoke is almost always delicious, the quality/ tenderness of the leaves may be otherwise. The ultimate success of any  artichoke recipe (stuffed or non-stuffed)is absolutely dependent on the quality of the artichoke itself. Globe artichokes from California are available year round. However, I limit my guarded purchases to the peak season - from March through May. I seek fist-sized (no larger) artichokes that are deep green - not brown, are heavy for their size, and have a tight leaf formation. The globe should squeak when the leaves are pressed together. Lack of satisfaction with your preparation of stuffed artichokes, does not mean that you cannot enjoy artichokes - there are non-stuffed artichoke recipes that are simpler to prepare. Remember to include the trimmed stems in the recipe. When cooked, they will be as delicious as the artichoke heart itself - the cynosure of all artichoke lovers.

Excellent!! Excellent!! Excellent!! I was looking for a recipe similar to the one my mom makes and this was the closest I came. Only thing I changed was I used 1 & 1/2 cups of seasoned bread crumbs and 2 cloves of garlic and I just added the oil a little at a time until I got the right "stuffing" consistency. I never knew how unbelievably easy these are too make! The whole family devoured these!! Including my 6 year old!! :)

This is how I've always made them, give or take a smidge of each ingredient (we never really measure). They're fanstastic! (When buying the artichokes, look inside the leaves to see how meaty they are. Larger ones seem like they'd have more, which can be misleading.)

These were good. We normally just steam our artichokes and dip in garlic butter. My kids make a meal out of them. Hubby and kiddies loved this recipe, hence the reason I'm giving it four stars. Although I enjoyed eating them, I wasn't "head over heals" in love. I was so hoping to replicate the stuffed artichokes I had with my "girl-buds" last March when we went into the city (NYC) to see a show. We ate at an Italian restaurant called "Carmines" and they had THE most amazing stuffed artichokes I've ever eaten, along with a wonderful sauce. I only made four artichokes, but used almost a whole head of garlic because we're totally addicted. Once steamed, I put them under the broiler to crisp up a bit. The sauce I made consisted of butter a little olive oil and fresh garlic. I added flour to make a roux and then added and chicken broth and black pepper. Thank you Michele for a very tasty appetizer!

Very good recipe and as good if not better than what I've had in restaurants.  I modified the recipe by using Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs and also incorporated the reserved stems, finely chopped.     Prior to cooking, I trimmed the artichokes leaves/stems.   Next, I used a previous reviewers suggestion by steaming them for 30 minutes, then removed the inedible part of the choke, stuffed them and baked them in 1 inch of water in a 450 oven, covered for 30 minutes, removed the cover and baked for another 10 minutes.  Delicious.   Nice variations suggested by others include adding pine nuts and/or proscuitto.

This was very good.  Only made a few changes...used olive oil and seasoned bread crumbs.  These changes were personal preference only.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post.

I have been eating these since I was a kid!  Tip** only put about an 1" - 1 1/2" of water in the bottom of the pot.  Cover and Steam, check frequently and add small amounts of water as it evaporates.  If you have a hot water bath canning pot with the rack in the bottom, use that, it will help the chokes stand and not fall over and get soggy.  You can also use Italian bread crumbs in place of the sliced bread.  While prepping the filling, place cleaned artichokes in a big pot with cold water and juice of one lemon, this will prolong the choke from turning color.  As soon as you start to clean the choke, it will start to turn brown, so the lemon helps with that.

Awesome!  My Italian family has made these for years. I just use 1 cup  Italian bread crumbs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and one clove of garlic.  Add Olive oil, not vegetable oil.  Fill Oven safe pot with lid 2 inches high with water.  Bake 1 hour, check at 30min to make sure there is enough water in the bottom of the pot.  If needed, add a little water.  Bake 1 1/2 hour til leaves pull easily out of artichoke.

Artichokes weren't originally on tonight's menu, but the supermarket had beautiful large fresh artichokes with 10" stems, so I had to try this recipe!

Thanks to the other reviewers for their suggestions.  I made similar changes: Italian breadcrumbs + panko, olive oil, and more garlic.  I steamed the artichokes for 20 minutes along with the peeled stems.  Let cool, then removed the choke.  Chopped the steamed stems and added to the stuffing.  

Sat the stuffed artichokes in 1" of water to which I added some chopped garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Into the oven at 450, covered, for 20 minutes then 10 minutes with the lid off.  PERFECT, didn't even need any butter for dipping.  

(Artichokes are very high in anti-oxidents....as if I need any further justification!)

these were good, i made some changes in cooking method as i wanted to make Giada De Laurentiis's Gorgonzola Stuffed Artichokes but didnt have gorgonzola...so i used her make-ahead bake method (Trim artichokes, remove center leaves ~not the heart~ boil in lemon water 30mins, drain upside down & cool, when ready to bake: stuff it, then bake 25mins @ 400). I used the stuffing from this recipe, substituting italian bread crumbs for the slice of italian bread. we liked it but next time we are going to do giada's with the extra gooey cheese in the hollowed centers. the stuffing for this one was kinda dry and bland, but an excellent starting point for next time.

This is my second time trying a "stuffed artichoke" recipe and neither has turned out very good - so I think I'll stick to steaming them in the future. =( I've been making artichokes for years and never knew you could rap them on a hard surface to get them to open up (so thanks for this wonderful tip!!) I followed the recipe exactly and while the 'stuffing' was tasty, my artichokes (which started out nicely wedged in the pot) seemed to shrink as they cooked, ultimately tipping over in the water and making a soggy mess of my stuffing. I also cooked them for an hour and they were tough ... Guess I did something wrong - but they certainly didn't turn out like I expected.  =(

Very good.  Artichokes are a staple of my childhood. In my version of this recipe, I add about a cup of white wine to the water, no oil in the water, and let it boil rigorously (to evaporate the alcohol) before placing a lid and simmering for 45 minutes.  The wine perfumes the artichokes and adds a nice hint of flavoring. I also add minced prosciutto to my breadcrumbs, delicious! You really can't go wrong with a little extra garlic and a finishing touch of garlic butter on the side...or drizzled on top, yum!

Step number two is missing.  Scrape out the choke before stuffing and sprinkle with lemon juice.  I added bay shrimp and more garlic.  You can also wrap them in foil and pressure cook for 10 minutes at 15 lbs.

Wonderful!!  We have made these for years.  We always use Italian bread crumbs in place of the bread, and add a bit more garlic.  If you like strongly flavored food, you can always add more seasonings to suit your taste.  We just made these this morning to munch while we wait for our Thanksgiving turkey.  DELICIOUS!

I have made this dish for my wife twice now. She has said that she loved immensly. The only thing that I changed was I used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread cubes and I increased the garlic to 3 cloves for that real Italian zest. I will continue to make this dish. Next time will be at a dinner party Steve

Best recipe I've tried for artichokes so far.  Used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread.  Perhaps a bit more garlic and I'd love to be able to try baking them.

Definitely save yourself the time and use Italian seasoned bread crumbs mixed with cheese and olive oil. It's easier to stuff between the leaves. I steamed them already filled in a steamer basket, then put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crust. My 3-year-old couldn't get enough. We dipped the leaves in unsalted melted butter. You don't need salted butter-the breadcrumbs add plenty. Also, scooping the choke out before you fill really saves you trouble when you just want to dive in!

I enjoyed this I put them in the steamer and steamed them for 60 minutes - they came out really good! (no oil - just used water but put 2 tbsp in the stuffing a recipe)

Thought the stuffing recipe looked simple & delicious (AND IT WAS) but i made several key changes (1) I used 1/2 breadcrumbe / 1/2 bread (2) I used whole grain bread, (3) I used oil oil and more of it and (4) I partially pre-cooked the artichokes by boiling in water for 20 min.  Then I cooked in the ove with water in the bottom of the tray for 20 minutes.  Came out great and I think healthier since I used grain bread and olive oil. Enjoy!

Make these all the time, this Artichoke recipe was excellent. Followed the recipe as written except added garlic powder and a little garlic salt. Made it in a pressure cooker which took 15 minutes depending on the size of the chokes.

Just like the ones my nana made while I was little.  I made my own bread crumbs from some day old.  That's all it takes to make it off the hook.

This is great, but I used more garlic, and bread crumbs instead of the cubes.  Then in a pan I sauted all the ingredients with a little bit of oil just until the bread crumbs browned.  Very tasty

This is delicious, especially if you add pine nuts like another reviewer suggested. I used cubed sourdough baguette though bread crumbs would a lot easier to stuff between the leaves. Added oregano and used parmesan cheese instead. I had large artichokes so I had to double the recipe.

I used this recipe as a base and took other review suggestions to complete it. I used Italian bread crumbs and nearly tripled the ingredients. I also boiled the artichokes for 20 min and scooped out the center before stuffing them. I topped them with more Parmesan cheese. They did turn out very tasty.

This was not allot of work, pretty easy.  I did use olive oil instead.  Maybe I did something wrong, but the bread was so soggy after cooking.  The concept of using Italian bread is allot better then using bread crumbs that are too salty.

Yummmmm! These artichokes remind me of the ones my Nana used to make.  I tried many years ago to make them, but decided they were too time consuming.  I have more time now and these are really so worth making.  I followed the recipe except I used olive oil & didn't really measure it and I drizzled probably a little extra over the tops of the stuffed chokes before steaming.  Also had to substitute dried parsley for fresh with no bad results there.  Try them, I think you'll like them.

YUK!  TOO much stuff, TOO time consuming, NOT worth the hassel.  I threw 2 out of 3 away. The only good thing about this recipe is that I figured out I can steam the artichokes in veggie broth in the oven instead of boiling them.  Nothing better than the tried and true steamed/boiled artichoke dipped in lemon butter.  Will NOT make again.

I am VERY puzzled. There was no 'meat' attached to any of the leaves. We kept going til we reached the fluffy inner part, but there was nothing else there! Is there supposed to be a heart or something? I've never cooked artichokes before so I am absolutely clueless! The cheesy stuffing was tasty but other than that, there was nothing at all to eat! Thank gawd I only spent a dollar on them!

My grandmother made a similar recipe using a pressure cooker. Artichokes cook in 20 minutes and you can eat the bottom of the leaves and eat all of the tender leaves toward the middle. I remove  the "choke" first to make more room for the stuffing. Also,  slightly toasting flavored bread crumbs in olive oil with cheese, garlic slices and fresh parsley before stuffing really enhances the flavor. Delish! --Yams

I thought this was really good.  It was exactly what I was looking for. My family wasn't overly thrilled with it, but I am an artichoke fan prepared this way!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It's similar to one that my grandmother would use and I plan on making it again :)

Soggy breadcrumbs on meatless leaves. I followed the recipe and the suggestions to blanche 20 mins/then bake. Perhaps I didnt pick good artichokes, but there was no meat to be heard of and no artichoke hearts in sight, but nevertheless the breadcrumbs were soggy and the artichoke came apart despite using the blanche/bake method. I doubt steaming alone would have made it any crispier tastier. I guess artichokes are just not my thing unless they are the canned/marinated variety!

Loved it!  the only thing I did different was I used Canoil oil instead. Before I studded the artichoke, I rubbed the outside with oil, I feel it helpd hold the flavor in.  I also continously added water and oil to the pot to help steam.  Tasted great!

I scaled the recipe for the 2 artichokes I bought. While I liked this recipe, and it is similar to my Aunt's, I would personally prefer more stuffing. I also would use bread crumbs next time, as it took me quite a bit of mashing to get the bread into "stuffing" size. But a tasty stuffing :)

This was just ok. In reading other reviews I did use olive oil and italian breadcrumbs. Definitely needed more garlic. Will take the advice of others by blanching first and baking covered in oven.

This recipe is great, just needs a little more. I minced up some black olives and added it to my stuffing. It doesn't give it a strong olive flavor but really makes a difference! I also grind up about half the stems and add it to the stuffing to make it thicker. Add a little lemon juice and pine nuts if you prefer too. Then I put chicken bullion in the pan with about 1/2 inch of water, then set the stuffed artichokes in the pan and covered with tinfoil. Baked at 375 for about an hour to an hour and a half. So delicious!

Exactly how Grandma, Mom and I have made them for years with the exception of the Oregano which we don't use.

We made these last night and they were great!  Only thing we did differently is to squeeze 1/2 of a lemon after cleaning and snipping the tips.  We'll definitely be making them again!

I used Italian bread crumbs with fresh garlic and grated parmesan cheese.  I also made this with two huge artichokes and adjusted the measurements accordingly.

This tastes exactly like my grandmothers, so this recipe is a keeper. There are only two changes I've made, based upon how grandma used to make it. The stems, once removed, are pilled and then diced into small pieces and added to the stuffing. This greatly enhances the artichoke flavor. Don't throw away the stems!  The other thing I changed was the amount of water.....oh my, grandma never covered half the artichoke with water and I didn't either. Only an inch to an inch and a half is sufficient. Keep the chokes covered while you simmer for 1 hour and add additional water only if necessary. When I was younger I'd scorched my chokes a few times because the water evaporated, but I am certain in my youth and inexperience, I was cooking them hotter than a simmer. Thanks for the tip of turning the choke over and "crushing" it a bit before stuffing. If grandma did this step, I'd missed it. It sure made stuffing a lot easier! :-)

Great recipe, so similar to my dads.  When I make these I simmer them in chicken broth and I baste the tops of the artichokes with the broth.  But basting helps keep the interior leaves nice and moist.

Very good.  I've made the recipe twice.  The only change I had to make was using Parmesan Cheese instead of Romano since that's all I had.  My husband enjoyed them thoroughly and so did I.  I used my vegetable steamer to cook them.  Delicious!  They cooked for 40 minutes in the steamer and came out perfect.  Very easy to cook this way without worrying about too much water in the pot.  They don't come out soggy at all.

One of the mainstay meals in New Orleans all year long. Great for hosting football games, add bowls of gumbo to go with it and you're set for a super party.

This was a great base for a stuffing - I did add more garlic but everything else was the same. I cooked as directed in a cast enamel pot and didn't have issues with them! The stuffing was so delicious and the artichokes were very tender - thank you!

I had not eaten artichokes in years, and when I saw they were on sale, I decided to stuff them. The process was very labor-intensive. It turns out that I'm not a big fan of artichokes, after all that work! (The stuffing was delicious though-- after all that cooking, it tasted very yeasty, the bread crumbs took a dominant flavor. It was almost beer-like.) My dining partner enjoys artichokes, and while he thought they were good, he said they didn't justify the work they entailed.
