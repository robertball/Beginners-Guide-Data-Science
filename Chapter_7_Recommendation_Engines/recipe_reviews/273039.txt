Fantastic cookies! The whole wheat flour adds another dimension of flavor to these chocolate chip cookies--almost a nuttiness--that's delicious! These are simple to make, too. The dough gets a bit thick though, so I had to kind of knead in the chocolate chips and walnuts, no big deal, but it does require a bit of oomph to get everything incorporated. And make sure to flatten the tops of cookies before you bake them--I forgot to for the first batch and they puffed up a bit more than what I like. Still tasted great, but flattening them out a bit makes for a more "typical" chocolate chip cookie shape. I got 42 cookies out of this (using  a medium cookie scoop), and they took 10 minutes to bake. Thank you for the recipe--I will most definitely be making these again!

These were a great change of pace from the norm.  I only made a half batch because my family is very picky on food.  Even our 4 year old loved them.  Only change was we did not have the walnuts on hand but, I can see where they would be very good.  We will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved these cookies and so does my husband!  The whole wheat flour made these cookies more flavorful than white flour.  Baked these for 11 minutes and 10 minutes for a softer cookie.  Will definitely be having them again.
