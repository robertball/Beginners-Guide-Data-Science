I made this last night for dinner. It was terrific. I substituted cabbage and water chestnuts for the tofu, used more garlic than called for and left out the vegetable oil completely. It was very tasty and a good summer time meal.

This is one of my all-time favourite recipes.. you can easily make it low-carb with switching to low-carb hoisin sauce, and swapping out the carrots.  All my friends wanted the recipe.

I made these with ground turkey and didn't use tofu (didn't have it on hand).  I also served with a sauce suggested in the reviews of another recipe (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp chile paste).  In my opinion the sauce put this recipe over the top! I will definitely be making these on a regular basis.  So easy and tasty.  Thanks!

Very good.  It did need additional hoisin, chile paste, soy sauce, & sesame oil.  We mixed the rice into the pork mixture which made filling the lettuce leaves a bit easier; however, they are still quite messy.  Messy, but yummy!

Sorry, but I have to tell you...this just didn't work for me at all. I made the filling
exactly as described and it was very tasty. But when I tried to wrap the filling,
the lettuce kept breaking and they ended up looking just awful.

I had been looking for a great lettuce wrap recipe ever since I had them at a famous asian restaurant.  These are it!!  I made them with local shrimp and they were just divine.  I need more practice with pulling the lettuce off in a whole leaf, but this recipe is good enough to keep trying!

We loved this one...taste just like the restaurant lettuce wraps.  Made it without the tofu and used ground turkey instead of pork.  Very easy to make.  A success when craving these yummy wraps!

This recipe is great!  I used hot chili oil instead of the chili paste and use bib or butter lettuce instead of the iceberg as it's easier to work with.

I was not sure about the tofu in this, so I omitted it. In order to take the recipe to the next level, I added celery and cucumber for some crunch, and cilantro for some extra flavor. It was absolutely fabulous. I was told that I have reached a new pinnacle in my cooking with this one! Always a good thing!

this was really good.  I skipped the rice and added water chestnuts.  I also added a little water to the mix as it was really sweet and dry.  I used the Boca Crumbles which were delicious!  Added a dash of ground ginger too.  Whole family loved it, a bit salty but the juicy lettuce was great with it.  My 6 and 2 year old were fans as well.  Super healthy and super easy!

I had been craving this for weeks, and this recipe did not disappoint. I completely omitted the rice. I was going to omit the hoisin, too, but it happened to be on sale. I'm glad I didn't! This recipe would've been lacking a lot of oomph without it. It wasn't the neatest meal in the world to eat, but it tasted so good. Maybe nest time I'll eat it like a salad... Perhaps, fry up some won ton chips and eat it like a Chinese Taco Salad? Or, just use a more forgiving lettuce. In either case, I WILL be making these again.

I was not fond of this at all. The tofu gave it a very squishy texture that required me to cook it for much longer in order to get rid of it, and even then it was about the consistency of stuffing.

I love PF Changs lettuce wraps so I thought I would try this recipe, didn't change anything.  The recipe was ok, did not taste "just like" PF Changs to me.  I think I would try it again, but with ground turkey instead of pork.

I make a vegetarian version using a package of Yves meatless ground in place of the ground pork.  I also add celery (3 sticks thinly sliced), water chestnuts (1/2 can finely chopped), and button mushrooms (7 finely chopped).  It turned out specatular.

Yum!  The possibilities are endless!  I didn't have Hoisin, so I used soy and teriyaki sauces. I also micro-planed ginger with the garlic.  I added finely diced mushrooms, celery, carrots, water chestnuts.  I really love the "kitchen sink" adaptability this recipe allows and will make it again and again!

Delicious! Made this for a group of 10 adults and everybody loved it.  Even got told it was just as good if not better than PJ Changs.  I did add a little teryaki sauce to it.

These lettuce wraps were an interesting experiment. I was searching for a recipe similar to the wraps served at PF Chang's. This was good, but not the same. The chicken mixture did NOT look appealing. I would not make this again.

Really good.  I added water chestnuts to give it some crunch and didn't use tofu. I don't think the rice is necessary so next time I'll probably omit it.  Super easy, too!

We would have rated this four out of five stars, but then we added more chili paste and hoisin sauce (not very much sauce came out of the original recipe).  Also, used turkey and tofu and it was excellent!  Thanks for a great lettuce wrap recipe!

Delicious!  I coarsely chopped a can of water chestnuts and used them in place of the tofu.  We also had some family members eat it salad-style, scooping the meat mixture and rice over a bed of chopped lettuce.

Excellent! I used ground chicken instead of the pork, added chopped water chesnuts and they were very tasty. I also used Boston Bibb Lettuce. Super quick and so easy to whip together. My husband loves PF Chang's wraps and he loved these. Totally a keeper!

We loved this recipe, although I made some changes. I used water chestnuts instead of tofu, and added sweet chili sauce instead of the paste. I also added a little more hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Very tasty!

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I substituted the pork with a meatless alternative (Crumbles), to make this a vegetarian meal. It was easy to make and tasted delicious.

Make sure there's enough filling - I subbed water  chestnuts for the meat and the hoisin sauce was a little overwhelming. I was hoping for a PF Chang's type lettuce wrap and these just didn't do it for me. Won't be making again.

These were fast & delicious. Everyone loved these. I did chage up a couple ingrediets, but that's what makes this recipe so wonderful! Used ground chicken, that was what was on sale at my store. We also don't really do Tofu, so I minced up a entire box of fresh muchrooms, plus a medium miced onion. No one was the wiser:) Everything else went in, & my family loved the results. Great recipe that allows you to work with what you have. Going in the rotation for sure.

I was really excited to make these but wasn't impressed.  I know the reviews for this dish are great but I guess that my taste buds are different.  My boyfriend didn't like it either.  We followed the recipe carefully and just didn't add hot chile paste and white rice.  I wonder if the chile paste would have given the dish proper flavor because what we had was bland and bizarre tasting.  Plus, I just saw the calories for this dish and they are extremely high!  I generally think that meat and veggies are healthy to cook together but with 837 calories for this appetizer, it is not worth it.

Love PF Chang's wraps, these aren't them.  But with some sesame oil, extra firm tofu and a side of love, they can be wonderful.

Excellent Recipe!  I substituted ground chicken breast for the pork, as my grocery didn't have any the day that I went and also used thinly sliced mushrooms in place of tofu.  This turned out wonderful and was just like eating lettuce wraps at my favorite Chinese restaurant.

My family loved this. I used ground chicken instead of pork and took the advice of another review and used water chestnuts instead of tofu. I also added fresh mint (dried mint works too). I didn't have any chile paste so just eliminated it. The dish was delicious and a total hit. There were NO leftovers.

Great recipe — tastes like the stuff you get at restaurants. I didn't use the rice...I didn't think it was necessary. Instead of tofu (I used mine in another recipe, ha), I added chopped bok choy and added it in with the carrots. I also added a tbsp of grated ginger. Tastes great!

We thought these were good, I made them with only tofu because we don't like pork much. I think they might be better with something crunchy noodles.

um, YUM!!! Followed the recipe, except for the fact that I'm a vegetarian, so I just did tofu. (I actually did SmartStrips brand chicken strips since they kinda resembled the pork. (I should have put in two boxes to make up for no pork, but whatevvvs!) Also, added once sliced red pepper and one sliced yellow onion. I'm soooo impressed. (Oh yeah, skimped on the rice... toooo lazzzzy!!!)

These were DELISH!  I followed the recipe almost exactly- added 1/2 again as much of the 'sauce' ingredients because I used 1.5lbs of pork.  These were REALLY good!  We'd add some fresh chopped cilantro next time and some chopped peanuts too!  Very tasty- very easy- very easy to clean up!  YUM!  Thanks for this!

this was really good, better than the other lettuce wrap recipes I've tried thus far so it is the one I am sticking with.  Good by itself or as a base recipe, only changes I made was to add some water chestnuts for crunch and some fresh ginger, also mixed the rice in with the rest as another reviewer had suggested

Yes, this is very good!  The lettuce provides such a refreshing counterpoint to the deliciously seasoned mix!  We loved it.  I had a little leftover rice on hand which I used, and added some fresh minced ginger root and bean sprouts.  Yum!  Oh, and I used chopped up chicken breast instead of pork.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, and also added a little hot chili oil! A big hit!

This was sooo good, I have been looking for this recipe for years. I doubled the sauce which is a must, everyone really liked it.  It is a good way to get tofu into the family one tip is to really dice the tofu up very small, and if you are clumsy like me buy two heads of lettuce in order to get enough pieces to actually use for wrapping

Very tasty! Much healthier than deep fried spring rolls too. I skipped the tofu and used chopped peanuts.

Very tasty. Great for my toddler who is on a wheat free diet. I didn't have any tofu and I used brown rice.

As is the only thing that should be changed was to use butter lettuce, it makes better wraps.  But what gives this recipe 5 stars is its easily adapted to you families tastes to make it perfect.  We ended up adding in more carrots, finely dicing the tofu, and serving it with sweet chili sauce.  We started to each make our own wraps as we ate but just gave up on the wraps and ate it over lettuce with the rice, it was just as good. I'll be making this again.

Tastes pretty good although I think the seasonings can be doubled  especially if you eat it with white rice. The rice made the dish a little bland.

So tasty! This recipe tastes just like it came from a restaurant.  My only problem was trying to get the lettuce to be perfect little cups :)
I used ground turkey and 3 scrambled eggs instead of tofu.

Great Friday night dinner, my children and husband all agreed that this was delicious. I used organic turkey and pork to save a few grams of fat and calories.  My children didnot even suspect the tofu!  I will make this again. Thank you for a great recipe.

Great way to use leftover pork from a tenderloin.  Chopped it small and also added onions, celery, peppers and mushroom to the stir fry.

I made it with chicken and used zucchini instead of tofu... but like tofu, the zucchini soaked up all the sauce flavors and was wonderful.  I also didn't have hoisin sauce so I used half the amount of miso paste.  I know - very different - but I really liked it! The only time the wraps didn't have enough flavor was when I used too much rice on the lettuce; the proportions of the meat to rice need to be right.  But the Flavor is there! :)  thanks for a great recipe!

This is by far the BEST lettuce wrap recipe I have found. I have made this exactly as written and I have changed it up by adding our own preferences. We love adding water chestnuts, mushrooms, peanuts, ginger and using cabbage in place of lettuce. This recipe is so versatile and each version we make is so good! I have been asked for the recipe many times. So good and very, very addicting!

These were great! Only modifications for next time would be to cut the rice in half, quickly sautee the tofu so it gets a crust and maybe double the sauce. Couldnt find chili paste, so garlic chili sauce was a recommended substitution online. I at least tripled this part and would even double that for some good solid heat.

Such a good basic recipe for wraps! I made the following modifications and it turned out great: used ground turkey instead of pork, used water chestnuts in place of tofu (per someone else's review) because my husband isn't a huge fan of tofu, used peanut oil instead of sesame (because I didn't have any), and used Tabasco in place of hot chili paste (I didn't have that either). We also used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg. It was a hit with my husband and my 2 year old daughter!

Great dish - hit of the party.  But I made some changes based on other reviewers comments;  Skipped the Tofu, added Sweet Chili Sauce, added waterchestnuts & shredded carrots (good for color & texture), topped each serving with sesame seeds.  I made it as an appetizer using endive and no rice.  I also served it as a main dish using nappa cabbage instead of lettuce because it holds together better.

AWESOME!!! Better than PF Changs and for the price of all the ingredients you get sooo much more portion wise.  The only addition I made was adding some chopped water chesnuts - I like the extra crunch and texture it gave.  Very tastey & recommend giving it a try :)

Made this for dinner tonight and LOVED it!!!
I changed it up ever so slightly: used a whole head of garlic (minced)and omitted the tofu. Instead of the iceberg lettuce "wrap" I chopped up romaine hearts, put it into a bowl, added a bit of white steamed rice,
A drizzle of sriracha chili sauce on the rice and then topped it with the minced pork mixture. Thanks!

Really great flavor blend, but very greasy.  I mixed in a bit deer sausage to cut some of the fat.  Added oil is not necessary since pork sausage is so fatty.  I think next time I'll either use turkey sausage or mix in ground turkey in place of half or a third of the pork sausage, so there's still that pork flavor.  I also left the chili sauce on the side for the grown ups only and my kids actually ate it!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a fabulous recipe even though I forgot the tofu by mistake. The soy sauce was added at the table. I even doubled the recipe and it was still fantastic. My 8 year old son even loved this meal.

Perfect!  For those having Trouble with the lettuce leaf's. Try using romaine leaf's instead of the iceberg. You can scoop mixture right in the romaine and you will also get more nutritional bang for your buck! ;)

Excellent!!! Will make this again.  I used ground turkey breast to cut down on calories, and left out the rice to be "low carb".  I was unable to find hot chile paste at Safeway, so I used a couple of tablespoons of "Sriracha" hot chili sauce (the bottle with the rooster on it). Also added water chestnuts.  So yummy!!!  Thanks for this recipe!

WOW. This was one of the best things I've ever made and eaten. I couldn't stop eating it, and ate leftovers for 2 days after. I used ground chicken, omitted the tofu, did 5 TBS of hoisin, 4 TBS soy sauce, added more siracha, and chopped some cabbage and water chestnuts..then sprinkled on some sesame seeds at the end. The water chestnuts gave it a nice crunch to it. I plan on making this many times again.

This recipe is killer! I left out the tofu, and doubled the sauce ingredients as a lot of the other reviewers suggested, used a little less sesame because it's how we prefer it, and instead of ground pork we got loin (less fat) and put it in the food mill to mince. Came out perfect. The sauce has an awesome flavor, used a little extra hoisin because we love it. I served it with steakhouse-style ginger sauce, and even my picky eaters got seconds. And, for those that are dieting on WW, it is like 3 points per serving, minus the rice. Definitely adding this to my repertoire.

I added in more vegtables like one of the other reviews had metioned. It turned out great. Will make again!

Made this with finely chopped chicken breast as that is what I had on hand  - truly loved the sauce.  A tasty (although messy) meal!

They were a bit on the salty side, and I LIKE SALTY.  If I were to make them again I would change it a bit.  Overall, they tasted good.

Wonderful!  We added peanuts and some chopped green cabbage.  I didn't have chili paste, so substituted Sriracha  and they still came out great.  I can see this as a staple on our family menu.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this dish.  It was very easy to make and better than PEI WEI.  I like mine with a bit more tang.  I doubled the sauces, added a teaspoon of garlic powder, and 3 Tbs of sweet chili sauce.  VERY GOOD!!!!!

I adjusted the recipe to suit what I had on hand and our personal tastes. I chopped up pork into bite-sized pieces because I didn't have minced pork, I didn't have tofu or the recipe, and since I like food with a kick, I added 2 T of hot chile paste. We also used romaine lettuce because that is what we had. It was a little messy, but very satisfying. We will make it with minced pork and tofu next time.

This is really good AS IS, but I always tweak a little to suit my own tastes. I like mine a tad spicier.  I noticed that someone gave less stars because their lettuce broke open. That's not the recipe's fault - just means their iceberg lettuce was really fresh and crunchy. A good fresh lettuce to use, that won't crack, is Bibb lettuce. Most major grocers carry it and it doesn't detract from the original intended flavor one bit. This recipe is going to save me a lot of money! : )

We loved it and will make it again!  I used chicken instead of pork and left out the tofu and hot chile paste and it was still excellent.

I tried this recipe over the weekend.  Although hesitant about the ground pork, I tried it anyways.  I will substitute chopped chicken breast next time.  The texture of the ground pork was kind of weird to me.  We also left out the tofu and added chopped mushrooms.  It was really a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

For some reason I thought this recipe called for chicken and that's what I had thawed out so that's what I used.  It was delicious!  Next time I will try the ground pork but it works really well with chicken too!  I didn't have any tofu, but added some almonds instead.  Fabulous!

These are tasty. They are very 'hoisin' tasting though. I used romain hearts as the lettuce and sandwiched the mix between 2 pieces instead of having to try to roll the lettuce. I skipped the tofu and used ground turkey as the meat. I will make these again!

I usually never write reviews but this recipe is AWESOME!  I just had the leftovers again for lunch.  The taste almost like the ones I get at PF Changs.  I left out the vegetable oil and substituted ground ginger for pickled ginger.  Not only did I save the calories that the oil would have added but it didn't seem to affect the recipe.

Really great! I did feel like something was missing from the sauce. Not sure what that is, but I will definitely try these again. I added water chestnuts for crunch, and used beef instead of pork.

The lettuce wraps were GREAT!! My husband raved about them and commented that he thought they were better than the resturant's wraps :)  I did make some alterations partly due to living in a small town where you only shop for the basics.  I used hot taco sauce instead of the chile paste.  I omitted the tofu and carrots (hubby doesn't care for carrots).  I had to make the hoisin sauce from scratch, but it was excellent.  I also substituted chicken for the pork. We will definitely make this a regular dish in our house!

So yummy!  Per other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and it was perfect.  This recipe is great because you can make it your own by adding other stir-fry ingredients.  I added mushrooms, peanuts and chopped baby corn - all of which were left-overs I had in my fridge!

This recipe was a great, but I had to make a few adjustments.  I substituted chicken instead of pork, I took out the tofu completely and added red, green, and yellow peppers as well as water chestnuts.  I also went heavy on the hoisin sause and the chili paste.

Very tasty and something we like to cook as a family.  Did not like using rice and tofu.  Don't need two fillers.  Next time will just use tofu, no rice.  Family loves it.

This recipe is incredibly flexible and delicious. I made it with finely diced leftover chicken and included shredded carrots and cucumber, crushed cashews, toasted sesame seeds, and jasmine rice. Other reviewers were right about the sauce portion; even though I used only half the amount of meat and rice called for, it could have used almost double the sauce. Regardless, it was delicious, using what I had available. My kid LOVED it, too! I'll make this again.

Perfect summer meal.  Easy to make!  I want to try water chestnuts for crunch the next time in place of tofu.  Also thought it was somewhat  bland (maybe a bit more chili paste to pop the flavors?).  Next time, I will try the suggested sauce from other reviews to see if it adds any more flavor/spice  (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp chili paste to dip in).

Will make again for sure. I thought a whole “bunch” of green onions would be too much but they weren’t. Not a fan of tofu so I omitted that but did add a can of water chestnuts that I chopped like some other reviewers. Good stuff.  Might try turkey or chicken next time for less grease.

My whole family liked it (tween, teen and husband)!  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  I did make the sauce that other reviewers suggested, it I think it is what made it a solid 5 stars.  (2tsp sesame oil, 2T soy, 2T rice vinegar, 1T chili paste (I used Sriracha)).  I also made plain white rice (Jasmine or Basmati) because my husband doesn't like how messy lettuce wraps are, so he put the meat and sauce over rice.   Make it, it's yummy!

This is  a tasty albeit mild dish. The idea of the lettuce wrap can sometimes be better than the execution, I suggest using Bibb/Boston lettuce for thicker more well-defines cups. Feel free to amp up the spiciness if you want a little bite: a little ginger and more chili paste would be good.

Used shrimp instead of the pork and tofu. I also had to substitute stir fry sauce for the soy and hoisin for a gluten-free option.

I made a hoisin sauce from scratch which took this to level six. Next time I'm trying ground chicken or turkey and see how that turns out. Boston Bibb lettuce rocks  as a wrap.

Maybe because we used meatless crumble it did not turn out right, but the hoisin sauce was overbearing. We cut the mixture with an equal amount of quinoa to make it bearable to eat. I think we just need to find out the right adjustment for the seasonings and it would be better. 
Thank you for sharing the idea!

Red lettuce leaves work best, as they are large and foldable. 
I used more fresh garlic than recipe called for, and this seemed to work well. I also backed off on the soy sauce, as the hoisen was salty enough.

Made this tonight and my daughter and I loved it.  I halved the recipe since there's only 2 of us, added some julienned carrots and radishes but kept the sauce quantity the same. I served this with rice and a side of watermelon. My only critique and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is, in my opinion, that there wasn't enough sauce. I halved the recipe since there's only 2 of us, added some julienned carrots and radishes. Next time will add additional vegetables, maybe cukes and maybe some lettuce, haven't decided yet.  Next time I'll double the recipe and thin it just a 'tad'. Thanks for this one, it will be repeated.

it is a good starter recipe.  I made a few changes based on preferences and availability of ingredients.  I did not use tofu or hot chili paste. I did add some red pepper  for a kick but not wanting super spicy.  I couldn't  find the right lettuce in the grocery  store so I use  romaine and did faux lettuce rolls.  I also added shredded carrots for color.  will make it again.  tasty.

these wraps were super yummy, but I did edit the recipe a little...I only put about half of the rice and added a little more hoisin, soy, and sesame than called for. I bought tofu for this recipe but I don’t think I would miss it and probably won’t include it next time. I used red leaf lettuce to make it easier to wrap, but it was still messy and that was my husbands biggest complaint.

Love recipe. Will fix again. Big hit with my vegan son. I made a few changes, no rice, vegan ground meat and used butter lettuce. Next time will use romaine or iceberg which are sturdier lettuce.

I made this and it was pretty good. Way more bland than I was hoping. I used a lot more garlic because that’s just who I am as a person. Ended up using significantly more chili paste but I think the one I used just didn’t have enough heat/flavor to my liking. Ended up adding a couple tablespoons of chili garlic sauce and it was perfect. Definitely a good basis to start the recipe, but I like a lot more heat in my dishes.

Added a few more veggies, celery, carrots, red onions, mushrooms, pablano peppers, Serrano peppers,  garlic, zucchini, fresh ginger - everything  in the veggie drawer....served w/ some left over basmati rice....and leaf lettuce.....lettuce wasn't sturdy enough to hold, but used like bread to push on spoon!!  Delish!  Was instructed to put on the next week list for dinner!!!  Thanks.

My family loved this recipe. I only omitted the chili paste, just because I didn’t have any, & it was still delicious.

I made this over rice rather than lettuce - it was delish! I made some tweaks though...I put about 4x more chili paste (we like spicy!) I also put the housin sauce in my rice to season it up with the other seasonings. This is definitely going to be a regular in our house from now on!

This recipe is delicious! I add chopped water chestnuts to it and do not put rice in the wraps.  I offer the chili paste on the side if I know some guests don't like spicy food.

I used the recipe, pretty much to get the idea of the main ingredients/sauce.  I used ground chicken or ground turkey, diced water chestnuts, and finely diced Shii Take (that's what the bag says) mushrooms that were rehydrated in very very hot water and then rinsed and drained and diced very small, and green onions.   I think that mine is more authentic as far as ingredients go.   I also used more of the sauce ingredients, hoisin, soy,  then the recipe.  My hubby loved it.

I never cooked ground pork in my life so after searching this site for an hour I settled on this recipe. My teen boys and my hubby LOVED it! They all had seconds! I didin't have shredded carrots so I used canned! I also didn't use tofu or chili paste...i used chili powder. I tore the lettuce into bite size pieces and I served it mixed with a rice blend that had carrots and kidney beans in it. My family told me to make this again and again and again! Tx!

I made this a few nights ago and it was a big hit.  Because one of our family members has diabetes, I omitted the 4 cups of water, 2 cups of rice, and the making of rice.
I followed the rest of the recipe and used Romaine lettuce because that's what we had in our refrigerator.
The sauce could use a little extra strength in the flavor but it was still very good.

I used shredded chicken, no tofu, and sweet chilli sauce instead of hot chilli paste. Tired out really good. Garnished with crushed peanuts for crunch and didn't serve the rice in the wrap, just on the side.

Delicious as is! We also had some fresh basil and mint, and fresh bell pepper. We added that to the finished product for some crunch. A delicious recipe to us for lettuce cups, and easily modified to fit your tastes!

So delicious!   I had to make some changes due to what was on hand.  Instead of carrots, I used thinly sliced orange peppers.  Also I didn't have sesame oil or chili paste, so I  left them out.  Also the lettuce  (iceberg) didn't hold up to make pouches, so we just broke some up and ate this with a fork!

Only change made was doubling the "sauce".  Next time to add some spice, we'll be adding some red pepper flakes. It's super yummy. Could do with less rice. I made 2 cups (dry) of jasmine rice and could have been fine with 1-1.5. Good thing we think rice is nice :) it's super yummy. It's messy, but will absolutely make this again!

I made this according to recipe with the exception on tofu. We found it to be a little bland so I added 1/4 tsp Chinese five spice and that punched it up just right. I didn't read the reviews this time which I usually do before making a new recipe so I don't know what others suggested. The family enjoyed it very much with the small tweak.

Made it as I had all the ingredients and was looking for something to do with what I had. This was a perfect fit and so good I will do it again and again.  
This is the perfect basic recipe for so many Asian dishes and fast to put together. The sauces together and how they taste are the key ingredient. Substitute the proteins of your choice.
Really simple.

After visiting a local restaurant and ordering this as an appetizer.... I fell in love! I made them and they came out terrific!  I did make a few changes . I used diced cooked chicken breast vs pork, cut back on the Hoisan & Soy Sauce and added toasted pine nuts. Will definitely be making these again!

This is delicious and easy. I sub an Asian peanut salad dressing, some hoisin sauce and soy sauce for an even easier make. Makes great leftovers as well.

I left out the tofu and used diced cucumbers instead. The lettuce we had was too messy (or we just weren't patient enough to create manageable wraps) so we ended up chopping it and making it into a salad bowl; still got the awesome cold crispiness of the lettuce with the hot flavours of the pork and cucumber. I used lemongrass instead of lime leaves and I added extra garlic and salt.

This turned out to be outstanding! The whole family wanted more. Omitted carrots and used chopped waterchestnuts and chopped cashews. And didn't have hoisin on hand so made it from this recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/substitute-for-hoisin-sauce-485430

Excellent dish for a potluck! also made a vegetarian version for my hubby by omitting the pork and adding another block of tofu. found that the rice was not needed for this dish which made it a carb-free dish.

AWESOME!  - after reading lots of reviews!: changes- minimal- added sliced water chestnuts, grated ginger, diced the carrots, made the side sauce ( 1 tsp sesame oil,  2 tbsp soy sauce,  2 tbsp rice wine vinegar,  1 tbsp chili paste); used Romaine lettuce- ironically had all on hand but the ginger. Spouse loved it! Will make again.

Loved it! Added diced water chestnuts and extra hoisin sauce. My family ate tofu (without knowing it) and loved it! I'll definitely make again

Wonderfully easy! I did not add the sesame oil or the tofu and loved the flavor. I kept everything else exact and WILL be putting this on my regular schedule. I loved the idea of making it carb free by not using the rice if we wanted. (I did cook it but used it as a side). It was a flavorful dish that was also summery because the lettuce made it a "cooler" meal. Oh and I also left the carrots out of the cooking step- used them as a cool condiment to sprinkle on top of the meat on the lettuce. I also cut up a couple extra green onion springs for garnish along with a few chopped peanuts. Thanks for posting the recipe! YUMMY!!

These are really good.  The first time I made these I didn't change a single thing but, as others have said, the lettuce didn't hold up well.  It was like eating an over stuffed taco using a soft corn shell (that doesn't mean I don't love eating messy tacos, I just don't do it in public).  I made these wraps again using 2 lettuce leaves.  They held up great and also gave them a little bit of crunch.  I've made these lots of times since then with different variations of ingredients depending on my mood and what I can throw together without having to go to the grocery store... That being said, with no changes to the original recipe they are very yummy -- and worthy of 5 stars.  I finally saved it to my recipe box so I had the exact measurements to give my sister.  Oh Yeah, I also have become very creative with tofu.  Thanks for that.

I accidentally bought a ground pork/ beef mixture but it still turned out great.  All of my men (3 teens and a hubby) loved it.  Keeping this one on file!

Great and messy - I added shrimp to make it more low-calorie and 1 tbls. of peanut butter.  I deleted the tofu ---- wonderful flavor.

This was pretty good.  I thought it was a little salty, but the hubs thought it was just fine.  I tweaked the recipe this way- I had left over roasted chicken, so I used my food grinder to grind up the chicken, then I did double the hoisan sauce and soy sauce.  That is where my saltiness could of come from, so next time I would use lower sodium soy sauce. I also added brown rice instead of white and put it in with garlic, ginger and onions, with the chicken.   Added fresh bean sprouts, which gave us the crunch, that it really needed and then I used butter lettuce in place of the ice berg,which I think makes for a much nicer leaf and very sturdy for rolling, and nice flavor.  It does resemble PF Changs lettuce rolls, and definitely will do it again!

Made chicken for my family and all tofu for me, the recipe was delicious! Used reduced sodium soy for my dad and everyone still loved it. Want to try it with mushrooms and water chestnuts next time.

Great flavor.  Easy. I did not have soy so I used tempura sauce.  I omitted the chili paste and my husband and I really enjoyed it.

I used tofurkey sausage in place of the ground pork, leeks instead of the green onions, additional soy (shoyu) and added sriracha to serve.  I ended up using a fork and eating like a salad because the filling was so good and the red lettuce leaves I had on hand were on the small side.  The sauce was fantastic, thank you!

The submitter is right - the possibilities are endless!  I improvised to use up what I had on hand.  I didn't have any green onion, so I just used a small yellow onion. Skipped the tofu (I don't think I've ever purchased tofu before!) I also only made 1 cup of rice (to 2 cups water), which was plenty for our family of 4.  We gobbled this right up.  I will definitely make this again. It's quick, easy and tasty!

This tastes just like the lettuce wraps from P.F. Chang's minus the dip, which it didn't need. I didn't add the tofu or the rice and it was AMAZING! I will be making this again and again.

I made this for the first time today. We liked it but I'm likely to play around with it a bit before I settle on the exact measurements. No left covers and there's just two of us so I'd say it is a hit :-)

I use those soy protein crumbles (even though I'm not actually a vegetarian) instead of the pork. You really can't tell, and it's awesome and incredibly healthy. I also drizzle some hot chili oil on the wraps before I eat.

Loved this recipe! Used finely cubed chicken thighs and added chopped water chestnuts. Omitted the rice and put out chow mein noodles as a "topper." I used the butter leaf lettuce instead of iceburg and they held together nicely.  Trying it with ground pork or chicken tonight.

Made these last night for myself, my bf and two of his Army buddies and everyone loved them. I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce (but I also used 1.5 lbs of ground pork) and they were definitely not dry, served with a slotted spoon since it was pretty soupy. Also topped with Oriental Dipping Sauce (from AR) and that really made the dish! This is a fun and easy recipe, great way to impress guests! I might try ground turkey or chicken next time just because I prefer those over the taste of pork. Also, didn't add rice -why take away from the delicious meat and the crunch of the lettuce! This one's going in the recipe book.

This is very good,  family loved it.  took it to the beach as an appetizer.  Subtituted  crispy thin chinese needles  broken up instead of the rice. Wash  Head lettuce, break into leaves and shake dry  , place in plastic bag with a paper towel to keep leaves crispy and fresh. Used a littles less jalapeno as  1 spicy enough  with hot chili sauce.

Now that I know this recipe, I will not order these at restaurants anymore. It is so cheap to make at home and tastes just as good. Next time I think I might add some crispy noodles (the kind that comes with Mongolian Beef)to add for texture.

This was a great recipe, I didn't really like it on lettuce though so I just mixed in some rice and had it like that! My friend came over and ate three bowls then asked me for the recipe! I used extra hoisin sauce, and thai sweet chili sauce instead of chile paste because I couldnt find any.

I used all tofu, and it turned out great. Loved the addition of the sesame oil at the end (I used hot sesame oil). Don't skip this part!

This recipe is excellent.  I make mine with turkey for meat eaters and tofu & rice for vegetarians.  Try eating with butter lettuce instead of leaf, butter will not break as easily.

Excellent- my husband raves about these and the kids love them too.  I was intrigued with the tofu idea (never having cooked with it much before), so I omitted the meat and just used the tofu- I also added some chopped peanuts because I love them.  I doubled the sauce as recommended on other reviews and it was a great, vegan & vegetarian friendly recipe.  We will use this one often!

Excellent!  I reduced the sesame oil to a smidge--it tends to be strong and turned off my kids one time I used it.  Followed the recipe minus the tofu--added some chopped waterchestnuts and used brown rice.  All three of my children loved it--including dad.

This is a good recipe but I have had better.  The sauce is good but it could use a little richness and there was too much meat.  My family loved it though so I am going to made again with more veggies and less meat.
