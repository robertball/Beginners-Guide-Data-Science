Not the best combination of flavors even though I love banana and zucchini... just apparently not together. Rose well and had a good texture but won't make these again.

This was delicious. All the flavors are distinct and blended and its moist and delicious. I used a little less flour and oil to keep it more moist and less carbs. So yummy!

Very good, moist. Accidentally added the sugar and cinnamon to the mixture instead of on top, still turned out well.

Rubbery texture although people seemed to like them. I thought that they were a little too sweet as well.

I just finished making these and have already eaten two!  They were very good and I will definitely be making these again.  I plan on serving these to my daycare toddlers, so I didn't use quite as much spice as called for in the recipe.  I made 12 muffins and a small "cake" in a round  glass bowl.

I made these muffins for my 11 month old son. We're not vegan but they were perfect because he's not supposed to have cow's milk or egg whites before 1 year. We both thought these muffins were delicious! 
I halved the recipe but still used 1 whole banana. I also used whole wheat flour and omitted the extra sugar on top. I had to bake for 35 minutes, and let them cool completely before removing from tray because they were a little sticky until cooled. 
I am definitely saving this recipe for the future. delicious!

Used whole wheat flour but otherwise as listed. Turned out moist and fluffy.  Perfect as they are not too sweet.

I used 2 1/2 cups of a mix of summer squash and zucchini. Used only 1 banana and 100% whole wheat flour. Also, I didn't have lemon juice so I used apple cider vinegar. They turned out great, and I kept them in  a tight container for days (took it to work for breakfast everyday).  Will make it again.
