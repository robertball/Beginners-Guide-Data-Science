You really can't go wrong with this recipe. It's super easy to put together, makes the whole house smell great, and tastes even better! I've made it a number of times since finding the recipe a few months ago. In fact... it's in the oven as we speak!

This is a great recipe!  

I have also discovered a great way to serve any leftovers.  Cut up the chicken and serve it cold with lettuce and almonds for a tremendous "grilled" chicken salad.  As an extra bonus, leftover sauce can be used as a dressing!  If yours is as thick as mine was, you  might want to add some water to thin it out a bit, though.

Absolutely delicious!  I wish I could be one of theose people who could say that I changed it to suit my taste but I made it exactly how it was supposed to be made and it was great!  Nothing needs changed or tweeked.  Perfect the way it is!

I was really skeptical about this recipe. I was afraid of the Dijon, thinking it would over power, but it was perfect and blended nicely with the  brown sugar and o.j. ( I am no fan of dijon but this worked great) I was also afraid it would be too orangy or too sweet and that the chicken would be bland. So I used chicken cutlet that I added salt & pepper to and then dredged in flour, shaking off any excess. This made my sauce really nice as it cooked and kept the thin chicken moist and it looked great. This allowed me to cut down on the cooking time by 20 minutes!The thin chicken needed less o.j. to cover.  Before putting my chicken in the baking dish, I lightly browned the onions in a tablespoon or two of butter. ( I used sweet onion)  I used a basting brush to thinly paint a bit of dijon on the bottom of the dish and then added half of the onions then I added the chicken. I also used a sprinkle of crushed red pepper after covering the chicken with the o.j. When it came time to make my sauce I did not use more o.j, but instead used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also reserved a tablespoon of the brown sugar that goes on the chicken at the end. I used that to sweeten my sauce to my taste and only used barely 1/2 of that TBS. I added another sprinkle of the crushed red pepper here, but that may or may not be too strong for some although everyone in my house liked it alot- even the fussy ones.Well almost everyone...my ole man said it was a bit on the sweet side and would be good

My husband and I really liked this recipe but it says to cover the chicken with orange juice and unless you beat the chicken, that is alot of juice. I added about a 1 1/2 cups and found that to be too much? Maybe I did something wrong?

This chicken is great!  My husband and I both loved it.  The only thing I will change when I make it again, is to add some additional mustard to the sauce at the end.  This will become one of my "regular" recipes.

Loved this easy recipe! The blended flavors was wonderful. I cut this recipe in half for two of us and made it in a dish that could go from oven to stovetop. Then mixed the flour with some extra orange juice and finished it on top of the stove without taking the chicken out. One less pan to wash!  Great recipe.

This chicken was great! I am not very experienced in the kitchen but this was one even I could do. When my wife came home she said she could smell it outside the house and knew it would be good. I am very pleased and will be making it again. Thank you.

Yummy! Simplified this by pan frying. Softened onions, browned chicken thighs. Then added orange juice, onion soup mix and 1/4 c. brown sugar. Brought to a boil and cooked covered. Sauce reduced to a lovely glaze without adding any thickener. Thanks for an easy family pleaser.

Delish. My middle son said it tasted like Honey Mustard sauce. I used less brown sugar. Had to strain the flour out of the gravy. Great change from my usual baked chicken.

This was good. I would add more mustard and some salt next time. I baked 2 chicken breasts in a 9x9 dish and the cup of orange juice didn't cover the chicken and it was fine. I baked it 20 minutes, then another 10 minutes after removing the juice. Served it over white rice.

This was good and I will make again but I would make some changes.  I would use Corn starch instead of flour (good for Gluten free) and I would add Bell Pepper and a little garlic with the onion. I might also try adding some Pineapple next time and maybe a slash of Soy sauce.  This is a dish you can play with. I made it in the Crockpot and added some Stir fry veggies a 1/2 hour before serving. Good stuff

I made this and you just have to adjust the recipe- don't use the brown sugar- then it tastes good - also I added spices over the chicken after the mustard

I honestly did not like this recipe and will not be making it again.  To me it tasted like Orange Sherbert melted and warmed over grilled chicken.  Not Yummy!  I have a sweet tooth, but this was just too much for even me.  For those with a severe sweet tooth, it might be good.  I give it a thumbs down

This was really good, and my husband liked it as is. I found it a bit too sweet, so next time I will cut the sugar just a bit. There was a lot of sauce, as one reviewer said, but some people really like a lot of sauce. Plus, I only used 3 half-breasts (one each for our supper and one for his lunch tomorrow), and I would use the same amount again if I had 4-6 breasts. I made sure I used a dish in which the chicken pieces were fairly tight together, so less liquid was needed to cover them. Anyway, it's a keeper.

My family did not enjoy this recipe.  Nobody finished their plate.  I suppose that it just didn't fit our taste.  All I could taste in this recipe was the orange juice.  It lacked a good mix of flavor.

I made this for dinner tonight. I found the chicken to be dry for a dish that cooks in liquid. The flavor is good. I served it with a baked sweet potato.

I used a little less brown sugar and butter and it turned out wonderfully! Nice subtle sweet flavor, the chicken is perfectly moist! and using the sauce as a gravy allows each diner to make it to their own taste. Roommate approved, too!

This is a very good recipe.  The thing that is missing in the instructions is to actually marinade the chicken in the marinade mixture for several hours before putting the chicken in the oven.  For those that complain of dryness, I recommend trying chicken thighs instead of breasts (more flavorful and more moist).  Other than that change, follow the recipe and you should have a very nice result.  Serve it with rice if you like - the thickened marinade works well with that base. It's a very nice, simple recipe that delivers a bit result in terms of flavor.  My guests absolutely loved it!

I made this for myself for dinner last night and have to admit I didn't love it.  I used red onions on top of the chicken and the combination of mustard, brown sugar and orange juice made them tast fabulous, but the chicken itself tasted like a bland chicken with orange juice on top.  I used a rather thick chicken breast but now think maybe this recipe might be best with thin chicken cutlets.  I don't know if I'll make this again.

I found the chicken very moist, but not very flavourful, although everyone liked it.  Maybe using orange zest will help.  Also, I think using cornstarch instead of flour will make the gravy "look" better.  I will try again.

Sorry, but this one just didn't do it for me.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn't what I ended up with it.  It certainly wasn't horrible or anything, but just fell short of my expectations.  I'm sorry!

This was fast and good, but not absolutely excellent.  It was a little plain, but the sauce did have a good flavor.  I used garlic powder instead of mustard; I don't like mustard.  I will make this again, although not frequently.

I liked this recipe, except for the onions. They seemed to be a strange flavor combo with the OJ and brown sugar. I'll make this again, because it was easy (simple ingedients!), but next time, I'll substitute garlic instead and see how that works out.

Too sweet for me, but the sauce on top of brown rice got the kids to eat rice without a grumpy remark. I agree with a previous reviewer that some more mustard added while cooking the sauce would be a good idea. I'm going to add some when I serve the leftovers.

I used green onion instead and added a splash of soy sauce to it before cooking (wanted it tangy). Also, because some reviewers noted that the dish was too sweet, I used less than 1/4 cup of brown sugar on top of the chicken. After cooking for 45 minutes, I poured a little honey on top of the chicken then popped the dish under the broiler for 10 minutes to brown up the top of the chicken. I did not make the sauce by adding flour at the end, but just served the chicken in the juices, which were delicious (making the dish gluten free, too!). Not too sweet at all, and putting the chicken under the broiler cooked away some of the liquid. The chicken was super moist, sweet and tangy. Plenty depth of flavor.  And really easy!

i've made this recipe several times, and love it.  my dad is the most pickey man on earth and i made it for him one night and he even liked it! i always know if its a great recipe if he likes it! you dont have to be precise on the ingredients though, just spread it all on lightly. i didnt give it 5 stars just because its quite a different taste, sweet, but tangy...it may confuse you when you first taste it.

Oh, where do I begin? The chicken was WAY too sweet! If I make this again I will half the OJ and completely omit the brown sugar. I would add chicken broth to make up for the decrease in OJ. I suggest maybe adding some Cayenne pepper and serve it over rice. I think it would make a good asian dish. Not impressed...

Absolutely wonderful.  We served this dish with white rice.  MMMM! the orange juice added just enough tangyness to help flavor the rice.  Even my youngest, most picky eater liked it.  Thanks for sharing.

This is just the recipe I was looking for!  The sauce has great flavor...I took the leftovers to work and shared some with a cowroker and everybody raved and asked for the recipe.  I served with streamed snap peas, carrots and rice.  This would probably be good if modified into a breaded chicken as well.

This was a good, different way to bake chicken. I used a combination of chicken and pork (what I had on hand) and my husband said he liked the pork better while I liked it with chicken. The gravy was good - sweet. We put it on our potatoes and the kids ate it up! If I tried this recipe again I would probably bake the potatoes in the same dish. I did use garlic salt to offset the sweetness.

My husband, daughter and I liked the chicken and the OJ/brown sugar flavor.  My son did not.  I prepared this without the onion.  The chicken was sweet and very moist.  I would prepare this again.

This is a GREAT chicken recipe!  The mix of flavors is unusual, but DELICIOUS!  The orange juice was enough to cover the breasts completely for baking and the resulting sauce was plentiful and perfect for preserving flavor and moistness while storing and reheating leftovers (of which there were few).

I have made this dish before, but something was always "missing". cone to find out it was the onion. I followed this recipe exactly, except for sauteeing the sweet yellow onion in a little butter before adding to chicken. Another person mentioned this, and it made it great! Will definitely make again! my husband said it was the best version of this to date.

We really like this for something different. I like adding broccoli, sweet peppers, and onion. Cauliflower would be good too.

Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion.

I sautéed the onion first and added red pepper and half a seeded jalapeño with the onion. Changed it to 2 servings and 1 cup of OJ was perfect in a small dish. I added  some orange zest to the sauce when it was thickening and a little to the rice when I prepared it. It was delicious and the chicken was perfectly moist and tender. Will definitely make this again!

I used Orange Pepper seasoned Chicken quarters (leg/thigh) instead of breast meat.
Also, decreased the orange juice to 1 and 1/2 cups and the brown sugar to 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons.
All else was the same. The meat was moist flavorful and delicious!

The first time I made this both my wife & I loved it, but felt it was lacking a little something. So the next time I added a little cayenne pepper and Louisiana Hot Sauce when thickening up the juices. Not too much, just to give it a mild kick. This is now a regular recipe for us! Thank you very much for sharing!

Very tasty sauce and the chicken cooked beautifully! I tenderized the chicken breasts so I wouldn’t need as much orange juice and added soy sauce and red chili flakes to taste in the sauce pan.

Only thing I would have done different was flatten out the chicken breasts I had. They were pretty big and took quite a while longer to cook.

With changes the recipe came out very tasty. The prep seemed odd to me and I didn't want over done chicken.  Also my family doesn't go for really sweet so I only used about 1 tablespoon of sugar sprinkled at the end.
Here's what I did different:
1. I had giant chicken breasts so I quartered them slicing the short way and then the long way.
2. put butter in a pan and sauteed the onions then lightly browned the chicken on both sides (not cooked all the way through) and put in a 9x13 with tin foil.
3. deglazed the pan with the 1.5 cups of OJ (added it while the pan was still hot to get all the yummy brown stuff), readded onions and mustard (Ray's Dundicott Hot) and some fresh peel from a tangerine got it all hot and put in a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with water to thicken.
poured it over the chicken and baked until the chicken was almost 160 degrees.
4. sprinkled some sugar and put the oven on roast for about 10-15min.

I cubed the chicken breast and left out the mustard. I misread the directions and added the onion and brown sugar  to the orange juice, mixed well, then poured that mixture over the cubed chicken.  I followed the rest of the recipe as instructed, except I used corn starch to thicken.   Served over white long grain rice and with stir fried snap peas, onion, garlic and red pepper, my family loved this dish.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't change a thing. I'm not a big mustard fan so I wasn't sure if it was too much or not. Well, the next time I make it I'll add a little more. The mustard was such a distant taste but also added alot of flavor. Also, I am on a low sodium diet which is important to my health and I love that a found a new dish to add to my low sodium diet. ??

This was great tasting and so easy.  All the ingredients mixed together to make a very tasty sauce.  Mine came out a shade darker than the picture and looked and smelled delicious.  I didn't have chicken breasts so I used 2 legs and 2 thighs,  Because there was so much space in between the pieces I just added enough oj to come halfway up.  It came out perfectly.  I did add salt and pepper first,  but other than that I stayed true to the recipe. I will make this again.

I followed this recipe to the T...it was very easy and tasted exactly like a name brand chicken l'orange; it was fantastic! My husband enjoyed it too despite his dislike for meals with too much sweet.
I even saved the left over sauce for another quick meal (all I will have to do is cook the chicken)!
Thank you for sharing Sherrie!

I really loved this recipe - my husband and young kids just liked it.

I only made 2 (large) chicken breasts, so I halved the OJ (which I made, using fresh oranges.  Delish!!)  I also only used about 2 Tbs of brown sugar.  It was plenty sweet.  I liked the freshness of the sauce.  

Next time, I might use a little more Dijon mustard, to give it a little more zing.

I'm definitely making it again!

It was pretty good. If I ever make it again I will add salt. Also,  if you use Wondra flour the gravy will blend much better than plain white flour in hot liquid. The chicken breasts I had were very plumb so I sliced them laterally and then pounded them a bit. Evenly thin breasts cook more quickly so if you do this you will need to reduce oven time a bit.

This was a simple, easy recipe to make.
I followed every step... After the 45mins, in a separate bowl I put the 1/4 cup of sugar, with the 2 tbsp of flour, (I did add salt and pepper) mixed it with the juice from the pan... Then I spread it on the chicken. I put foil paper over the baking pan and let it cool off.
Thank for a delicious recipe, I will be making this again??

I used half brown sugar, half honey, dash of salt, minced onion (using food processor) , no pulp OJ and marinaded chicken pieces for two nights. I should have separated chicken from juice, put butter and baked it in an oven from the beginning. Cooked juice with flour on stove but sauce did not thicken and looked a little odd - tasted great with salt, though. It did not taste orange too strong.  Onion should have been chopped instead of minced, as the recipe says. Overall, I liked it!  Left-over sauce can be put on white fish or something.

This chicken is awesome! Although, I did sprinkle a little poultry seasoning on top of the chicken before pouring in the orange juice as I found that it was a little too sweet without it.

This recipe was an absolute disaster to make but was incredibly delicious.  My chicken breasts must have been MUCH plumper than most other reviewers' because I had to use almost twice the orange juice the recipe for to cover 90% of the chicken.  That meant the flour called for was inadequate so I had to keep adding until I got the sauce to thicken.  But the taste is WONDERFUL!  Might try making it in a smaller casserole dish next time which would decrease the amount of orange juice needed.

This was a simple and yummy meal.  The only thing I might change next time is to stick to 2c. of OJ, even if it doesn't cover the chicken....I ended up with WAY to much sauce. Paired with a vegetable and some crusty bread...for mopping up the sauce...it was a nice meal, that everyone enjoyed.

This was fantastic! I made this twice and the second time I made a few tweeks.... Both was worthy of 5 stars so don't get me wrong here... The second time with the tweeks... First - I added 1 TBS diced jalapeno to the mix. Second - I made a extra amount of sauce and marinated the chicken in it for 4 hours before cooking. To us this really helped bring the flavors together. Finally - I used cornstarch instead of flour in the final making of the sauce.

way to much oj, and my oj (fresh squeezed) turned bitter during cooking.  How can you have a 5 star recipe with no seasonings?  Even with seasonings there was no saving this.

Okay, this was like, the best thing ever. I would definitely make it again. That being said, I only used about half the orange juice recommended, and it still covered the chicken.

Didn't care for the orange juice to flavor this chicken.  I'll try the orange marmalade next time instead.

I found the dish too sweet. Probably could use less brown sugar. Honestly though, if you like sweet things, you should give this a try. The sauce was interesting to make though.

This was an Ok dinner quick and easy, a few suggestions , marinate the chicken in the juice for at least an hour , also use a good orange juice like simply orange , i thought the sauce was lacking a depth of flavor, I think it could have been reduced more I used a big pan so I had lots of juice and used cornstarch to thicken , alot of people complained about the flour being clumpy so mix the flour with a little juice first then add next time I will try by adding the juice to a light rue first this may help.

Really good. The whole family enjoyed this. I did have a problem with the flour making the gravy lumpy, and will use cornstarch next time. Didn't affect the taste though. I personally think the chicken would be better without the onion, but hubby really liked it that way. A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!!

This turned out very good. Contrary to other reviews it had plenty of flavor. One change I made was to let the fish soak in the OJ for just a bit before prep. Would do it again.

I added sliced almonds to the chicken after putting on the onions.  This added a touch more flavor which made the dish great!

We loved this -- the flavor was just right for us -- not too hot (spicey)!  We will make this again and again!

My 3 sons devoured it, they are 4 and under.  But my husband and I thought it was good just bland, which can be improvised in the future. I'd use this recipe again, though.

I thought this was quite tasty.  I used 4 large chicken legs and baked them in my toaster oven.  It did take longer to bake, tho.  About and hour and a half. I didn't do the last step of making the sauce.  I liked the taste of the combination of orange juice, onion, mustard and brown sugar.  Will be making this again with chicken breasts.
