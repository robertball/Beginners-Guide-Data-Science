Even though in the recipe I say to add your choice of ingredients... (choc chips, nuts, raisins, toffee bits, etc.) the truth is that I personally prefer them with NOTHING. I love to eat them in the morning with a nice cup of creamy latte or cappuccino. That way I can enjoy the flavor of the oatmeal.... YUMMMM

I am very happy you are enjoying my recipe and thanks to everyone for posting a review!!!

So good it makes you want to say it with your mouth full! I halved the recipe, used an 8X8 pan, added some pecans and some milk chocolate chips. I didn't over do it though because I really wanted to taste the oatmeal in them, which I love. I predict my husband and I will *magically* make them dissapear in the next two hours. Thanks Milly!

This seemed more like a bar cookie rather than a 'brownie', but it doesn't matter...this tasted great! I used butter flavored shortening, mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans (just used what I had in the house). I also baked it a little differently; 20 min at 350, the middle was still soft so I lowered the temperature to 325 and baked it for another 8 minutes so I would not have burned edges. This worked PERFECTLY-center baked and edges still soft. This recipe really can take on different flavors depending on the add ins.

I've been preparing this recipe for two years.  Raving reviews from friends.  Great texture.  I use rolled oats, not instant.  For a smoother texture you can used instant, or grind some or all of the oats in a food processor.  I also use whole wheat flour.  I have made it with lots of flavor variations.  Some of the favorites were:  ginger, red chile and diced dried mango pieces; ground almond, almond extract, orange zest, dried cranberries and white morsels; pecan and chocolate chips; chopped salted pistachios, dark chocolate and cardamom; raisins, chopped walnuts, cinnamon; shredded coconut, almond flakes and cocoa powder; etc.  Can't go wrong.  I recommend smoothing the batter in the pan, and letting them cool completely before cutting them up.  Freezes nicely.

The bars are baking right now but I just had to comment that the batter itself was great.  I actually just added some ginger powder and semisweet chocolate chips.  I think it will be a winner.
Thank you for the recipe!

These are amazing! So quick and easy to throw together and wonderfully moist and chewy. I added milk chocolate chips, no nuts or raisins since they were made for a function and I was worried about nut allergies and raisin haters! I left only one on the table for my hubby and he was ticked that's all he got! Excellent. Addendum: I made these again today, and once again they deserve 5 stars! This time I put in a handful of chopped walnuts and some mini chocolate chips. I love these with or without the optional items. Thank you Milly for sharing this recipe, love these 'brownies'!

Delicious!  Great texture, easy to make, and would be the good base for a lot of variations.  Next time I think I'll try toffee bits and milk chocolate chips.  And I think they'd be delicious without any chips added but with a teaspoon of cinnamon.

This is fabulous! I knew when I seen the recipe published I was going to like it and couldn't wait to make it. I would describe this like an oatmeal cookie cobbler ... something like an oatmeal cookie that doesn't quite set up but different somehow. It's soft, moist and gooey and delicious served slightly warm. I added just a little coconut, walnuts and chocolate chips. This would go so well with a scoop of vanilla icecream. It's not a fancy dessert but it is one of the tastiest and satisfying. Follow the baking instructions and pull out when golden brown. It will set up when left to sit as instructed. Thanks Milly!

Excellent chewy brownie! These were rich and so delicious. I had to bake them quite a bit longer though as they were still gooey and underdone after 25 minutes. This was very difficult to spread in the floured pan though. I would skip the flouring step next time and just use non stick spray. I added 1 c of semi sweet chocolate chips. These are great!

My double batch just came out of the oven and it's fantastic!  I did one batch with a scant cup of unsweetened coconut flakes, craisins, and chopped dry apricots.  For the second batch, I substituted 1/2 cup of peanut butter for 1/2 cup of butter and threw in a big dark cholotate bar chopped into chunks.  Both are delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thanks, Milly!

This is SO delicious & versatile.  If it's too much butter for you, then replace a 1/4 C of butter w/ a 1/4 C of applesauce.  Yum!

They were okay. Even with semisweet chocolate chips and macadamia nuts they were a little bland. Maybe better with dried fruit pieces?

Loved this! I added coconut and pecans.  So moist and delicious!  Can't wait to try other mix-in combinations and  also without any additions at all. This is really a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I made these for some people at work.  They raved about them.  One even paid me to make some for her grandchildren for Christmas.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I used chocolate chips and walnuts.  They were perfect.

I'd give this recipe10 stars if I could. I substituted butter flavored crisco for the butter and I used quick oats. For my add-ins I used half a bag of white chocolate chips and 1 tsp cinnamon. I baked for 20 minutes in a glass 9x13. I took these to work and they got rave reviews!

I had made these to take to work and they were a huge hit!   I added about a cup of golden raisins, because that's what I had on hand.  Really good, especially considering how easy they are to make.  Milly, you're the best!

These are very gooey and I actually cooked them longer than stated  but they are delicious and after I read other reviews  about them being 'gooey ' , I felt a little better .  I added the chocolate chips and substituted craisins .  Wondered if the added chocolate  along with the butter  contributed to the texture .  I will try these again without additives and compare textures

These were pretty good, although alittle bit to dry. I made the recipe as written and used Chocolate Chips as my add in. I think next time I will use maybe only a cup of oats.

Absolutely perfect! Chewy, flavourful and very easy to make. I only used chocolate chips in the whole batter, and added pecans to half the batter. No raisins. I will try by adding toffee bits as well next time, it seems like they would be the ultimate addition! thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

It was ok.. but maybe I over cooked it a little (25 mins @ 350, 8 mins @ 325 as per another reviewer) cuz mine were't gooey at all and a little cakey, dry and blandish.  They would be good as a breakfast item with a glass of milk for kids that don't like to eat breakfast.  Ty anyway, i'm sure I did something wrong!

These are fantastic, and they are going into my permanent list of christmas goodies!!  Instead of cooking them in a 9X13 I cooked them on a 1/2 size sheet pan on parchment paper.  They came out chewy and moist, and easier to cut into bars for giving as presents.  I made 2 batches so far, one with butterscotch chips and one with semi sweet chocolate chips and mixed nuts.

I was in a pinch after ruining a batch of cookies; I needed to bake something else quickly.  These fit the bill.  I hoped they would be delicious and chewy and perfect.  I wasn't dissappointed.  Followed recipe exactly.  Thanks Milly! :)

These are exactly what I was looking for. Like the moist middles of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. I added chocolate chips and walnuts to mine and followed the recipe exactly. I'll totally make these again!

This is a great base Blondie recipe. I made it plain, baked it 20 min at 350, then 8 min at 325 to cook the middle without over Browning the edges. I will use this a lot with different add-ins. Next time I will try adding walnuts and dried cranberries or cherries!

After a wonderful meal with my hubby, both of us had a taste for something sweet. I split the recipe in half, added a dash of nutmeg, all spice, cinnamon and ginger. Super yummy! I wish I had placed a glass of milk in the freezer until it got a thin layer of ice....

One of the most delicious "brownie" recipes I've ever tried. I was out of brown sugar and only had 1.5 C of rolled oatmeal, so I substituted white sugar for the brown and used .5 C of Irish steel cut oatmeal for the remaining oatmeal. Due to the oatmeal substitution, I had to cook an extra 10 minutes but in the end it turned out amazing. I crumbled the brownies up and layered them in place of nilla wafers in banana pudding... It was a huge success. I will be making this recipe again!!!

Nice flavor however they are very dry. I baked them 20 minutes, the brownies were slightly underdone in the center of the pan when I removed them from the oven.

These were delicious,very moist and so easy to make. I added walnuts, white choc chips, dried cranberries and toffee chips. I needed to cook for 32 minutes and they were still quite moist. Very flavorful and will definitely be made again and again! Thanks, Milly!

These were good, but not as sweet as i expected. They tasted like a healthy oat bar that you would eat for breakfast. Several people in the group really liked them and others thought they needed to be sweeter. I added about a cup and a half of chocolate chips.

Loved them!  I don't actually like blondies, but I was intrigued by the oatmeal and had the other ingredients on hand.  The aren't super-rich like a brownie, so we ate them all very quickly.  They remind me a little of granola bars, if granola bars were soft and delicious.  I'm making them for our upcoming flight so we'll have something great and easy to eat on the plane.  Thanks!!

Addictive that is all I can say! Made for friends, everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Make sure that you mix the brown sugar and butter until creamy before adding eggs. I used dark brown sugar because that was all I had. I think that it added some depth to the taste.  For add ins, I only used golden raisins and chopped walnuts. About 3/4 cup of each. Next time I will try the chocolate chips and coconut. Any way you make people will love it. They are delicious and easy. Thank you Milly!

This is super easy and yummy.  A cross between a cookie bar and a brownie.  I add a cup of chocolate chips but raisins, cranberries or nuts would be a nice addition.  It reminds me of an old fashioned recipe in such a good way.  Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe; you can really customize it by adding what you like & it's pretty much fool proof. I made mine with butterscotch, white & milk choc chips, golden raisins, dried cranberries, & pecans (about 1/3C of each). I did have to bake it for an extra 10 minutes, but other than that this was perfect; will definitely make again!!

Milly, I love you!  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for today.  I wanted an easy, chewy bar-type dessert, not chocolate, maybe oatmeal...I typed "oatmeal brownies" into the search and this recipe popped up.  Perfect!  I was a little worried there wasn't quite enough dough for my pan, but I spread it evenly to the edges and it baked up nicely.  My husband, kids and the neighbor kids all loved them. I added a handful of chocolate chips but they would still be delicious with no added ingredients as the submitter suggests in her review.  This is absolutely one of those recipes I will make often.  Thank you so much for this simple but yummy recipe!

These are very good.  I was craving a blonde brownie with no chocolate and I love oatmeal in baked goods.  This recipe fit the bill!  I used one stick of unsalted butter and one of margarine and added an entire bag of toffee bits and about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I think my pan was a bit bigger than 9x13" so I had trouble spreading the batter.  However they did bake almost 40 minutes.  I really like the texture and chewiness of the finished product.  I will make these again.  Coconut will definitely go in them next time!

These were very popular with everyone who sampled one. They seem more like an oatmeal bar cookie than a brownie, though. I added some chocolate covered caramel morsels which took these over the top. Definitely choose add-ins of some sort as they would be rather plain without.

I was disappointed in these, I'm afraid.  I found them to taste like a soft, bland, oatmeal cookie.  They are edible, but I found them lacking in flavor.  I did follow the recipe exactly as written, and did not add any chocolate chips or other additions.  Perhaps that is what is needed for more flavor.

These are incredible!  I made them with semi-sweet chocolate chips, and they were a huge hit at Thanksgiving.

I just made these to take to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. They are so good I'm going to have to hide them from us so they make it to the dinner! I added a whole bag of chocolate chips- decadent with a capital D!!

Just made these & I am having to resist the urge not to eat the entire batch!  Moist,delicious, and super easy to make.  I added chocolate chips, but I agree that they would be delicious even without any add ins.

What an amazing recipe!  I made it as written.  I used white chocolate chips.  I imagine this recipe will be delicious with any add in.  I will be making this often.

Thanks for the great recipe Milly!

These were absolutely amazing! I added some cinnamon to give them a more oatmeal-like character. I also put chopped walnuts, bittersweet chocolate chips, and toffee pieces into the batter.

Should be called "To Die for" brownies. Called for chocolate chips but didn't say how much. I used an 8oz bag - a combo of butterscotch, white and milk chocolate chips. Used pecans instead of walnuts for a milder nut taste. Have made numerous times and just now rating this!!
My husband and Boss's favorite recipe.!

Sorry to say I didn't care for this... It's pretty dry and would be flavorless if it weren't for the chocolate chips. I had to double check the recipe because I thought I missed something, but I didn't.  I made it to share with people, too... Needless to say there's only one piece missing lol
Maybe if it had some bananas or something in it? Something to make it a little more moist and tasty.

They are ok. I was disappointed with so many 5 stars. I would consider them more of a breakfast bar or snack. They were more cake like than brownie and were dry. Not very sweet either.

Good consistency and flavor. I love how easy and quick they are to make. I added some semisweet chocolate chip but next time I think I will add a little shredded coconut too.

This is the second time making these brownies.  I replace the butter with 3/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  And, I use 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar and 1/4 cup splenda for both sugars.  Dark chocolate chips, chia seeds and cranraisins.  Addicting!

Tasted really good but was pretty much like a thick, moist cookie. Wouldn't call it a brownie, but a bar cookie.

These were good, but not best ever. They were a bit too cakelike for my preference and a smidgen eggy-tasting. I added chocolate chips to half the batch, but the side without was surprisingly my favorite.  The comforting flavor of the oatmeal shines through without the chocolate.  If you like a simple oatmeal cake/bar cookie you will like these.

Delicious! Everyone loved these. However, I had to adjust the recipe using ingredients I already had in the house. For flour, I used whole wheat pastry flour. I only used white sugar. They were the perfect texture!

Great base! Next time, I'm going to make 2 different batches- One with butterscotch chips and one batch with semi-sweet chocolate chips and coconut as the flavor of the base offers endless potential.

Easy recipe to make. I made half with Hershey Cinnamon Chips (guys liked them).  Other half I split between plain (my favorite) and toffee chips (haven't tried yet).  Added walnuts to the whole batch - good move; I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Kept the white sugar in - not sure it's necessary but can't compare until try them again (which I will).  To me, they are a "chewy bar". Perhaps the secret to the "brownie" reference is to bake them just a little less than you think you should (knife just a smidge less than totally clean when tested) and let them finish outside oven.  I decided to cover mine with a towel while cooling to keep in a bit of the heat rather than  keeping in oven and risking drying them out while baking - maybe that helped to keep more chewy. Next time may try a variation with the ginger that someone else proposed and maybe a different nut and may shave 2 min. off cook time. The person who said they were good for breakfast with tea, coffee or milk was spot on! And who knows, maybe they will be even better tomorrow. Thanks for adding a bit of a different bar cookie to this collection.

I didn't care for this one at all. It took longer to bake as the center was too soft (I kept checking every 5 minutes. They were OK while they were still warm, but after they cooled, they were very dry. I added chopped dried apricots and walnuts. The fruit and nuts tasted good together.

I absolutly LOVED the recipe for this. I came across it looking on the web for different desserts that didn't require chocolate and this is what i found. Granted i had to tweak it a lil to make it not as sweet but it was still absolutly delicious.

I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars.  I have made 3 pans of these in 3 days now for different potluck type events, and they have gotten rave reviews every time.  They literally fly off the platter!  Delicious, easy, and simple.  My kind of recipe!  Thank you for providing it.  I added chocolate chips and raisins twice, and just raisins the last time.  Wonderful every time.

I love the suggestion added on to leave out ALL the sweets, I would add the nuts on this new idea and have more of a breakfast bar. This way you can mix up one base recipe, divide it, bake one half for breakfast and then, add all the extra fun sweet ingredients and bake the other half for a dessert or for a treat.  I love recipes that can be made in numerous ways.

Not really a brownie (more like a bar) but still very tasty with a cup of coffee. I didn't use any add-ins, just a little cinnamon and it was delish.

Excellent!  This was a huge hit!  I forgot to flour the pan, but they still came out of the pan easily.  I did cook them longer than directed, until the center section seamed fully baked.  I cut them into squares, about 1 1/4" and they were nice a chewy and full of flavor (with dark chocolate morsels, raisins, and walnuts.  Will definitely make it again!

They were good and tasted just as I expected they would.  My husband loves oatmeal cookies with milk chocolate chips in them, this is the bar cookie form of the same.  I used milk chocolate chips and pecans as the mix-ins.  Tasty!

Delicious. Made with 1/2 butter and half coconut oil. I think I went overboard on the chips and nuts but everyone loved this and asked for it again. Will make repeatedly.

These turned out very much like blondies. The texture was chewy. They were not cake-like (which is a good thing for me). I baked in a 9x13 glass dish. It took about 40 minutes baking time, if not more.  It gets 4 stars because I don't think I would make it again. I think I prefer blondies without oats, even though I am a big fan of anything with oats.

Flavor was great. It's more like a cookie bar, as another reviewer pointed out. I added chocolate chips and was pleased. Center was very gooey, so we will need to work on that.

Absolutely wonderful. I substituted coconut oil for the butter which gave them an extra coconut flavor. The kids loved them. We even drizzled caramel topping over some for an extra sweet treat!

The key to making these perfect is to have them even thickness and bake correct time. I used parchment lined light-colored Teflon pan and baked about 23 min. I put big dobs of dough into pan and then smoothed with rubber spatula to same thickness. Checked after 20 min and one side was done (then I could see that this was a bit thinner) so I covered that with foil. A few minutes later - checking every minute - they were all done. When finger pressed lightly into top makes no indentation, they are ready, but don't wait any longer. Then cut them up as soon as cool and refrigerate. Otherwise they will dry out. They really are more like breakfast bars, but delicious. I used about 6 oz chocolate chips, but imagine if more fillers are used it would make them drier.

Great recipe! I made the recipe as stated. Added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips with walnuts and coconuts. It's absolutely delicious and you must try this recipe. I would describe it more as a cookie bar rather than a brownie. Nonetheless, super yummy and quick to throw together!

Dangerously delicious !! I made one change as I was out of baking soda,  I used 4 tsp's of baking powder. The only add on I had was sea salt caramel chips and I added about 1 cup. These are not going to last long, thanks for sharing.

After reading the reviews, I was excited about these.  Just wasn't impressed afterwards.  I made them exactly as written, but mine turned out greasy and almost tasted fried, rather than baked.  They were golden brown, but caramelized on the bottom, the combination of sugar and butter frying them.  I hope others who try them enjoy them.  I'll keep looking.

Such a nice change from chocolate brownies.  Tasty, chewy but a lot for just two people. Would freeze them next time and thaw just a few - who am i kidding- thaw about 6  at a time just for me or really just eat them right out of the freezer they were that tasty!

I have made these two ways. One with raisins and chocolate chips.  My hubby said he'd prefer without chocolate.  The next batch I use raisins and cranberries.  Yummy either way.

These are my "go to" blondies! I usually cut the brown sugar in half and they're still plenty sweet. They are extremely versatile - you can add whatever add ins you want - my favorite is white chocolate chips and craisins, sometimes with shredded coconut. Even without any chips, they are still delicious and always get rave reviews.

A little bland. I used unsalted butter, and it could have used the salt. Oatmeal texture is nice.

I used 1 cup white wheat flour and 1 1/2 Tbsp coconut flour instead of the 1 1/2c white flour and I used turbanado sugar instead of white. These were really yummy but seemed almost too buttery. Maybe using the recommended flour would help with this and cutting down on butter just a bit.

Great recipe!! I used chopped walnuts and raisins as my "mix-ins", between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup each. I also combined the dry ingredients first before mixing into the wet ingredients. This includes tossing the raisins and walnuts into the dry - it helped separate the raisins (sticky and clumped together coming out of the box). Baked in my edge pan and it was perfection!

These bars tasted fabulous!  Unfortunately, they didn't look as good as they tasted.  I should have followed another review's suggestion and turned the oven down for the last minutes of baking because the edges got more done almost too hard and the middle was still soft.  I also would not recommend putting chocolate chips AND toffee bits in the bars.  One would have been plenty.  Will definitely make again and again.  They were very good!!

I added a pinch of nutmeg and scattered a small amount of chocolate chips on top before baking. My husband (who usually doesn't eat cookies) finished most of the single batch in 3 days!

These were pretty good, I used chocolate chips only (no raisins or walnuts).  I may try those some other time, or maybe add cinnamon?  Again, these were good, but they needed just a little something.

The absolute best. Have made with semisweet chocolate chips, but the best, by far, were made with sea salt caramel chips. I keep thinking I will make with dried cranberries, but I can't get past the caramel chips!!  A new family favorite. Thanks for sharing.

These were very good!  They were a bit on the thick side, so I might divvy up the dough into one 9x13 and one smaller pan, next time.  I added a bit of flaked coconut to mine.  Hubby approved!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Milly!

I followed the ingredients for this recipe exactly.  The only thing I changed is the size of the dish - I used a little bit smaller dish.  After being in the oven for 20 minutes the top and sides were burning but the middle was liquid.  I turned down the heat and kept in another 10 minutes which only burned it more. Very disappointed.

I swapped out the nuts to add dried cherries (growing up, I thought ALL chocolate chip cookies had oatmeal!).  Esp in the summer, I like baking bars instead of cookies.  Watch carefully in the oven:  mine turned golden, but maybe not golden enough, as they're gooey and maybe a smidgen undercooked.  In the summer heat, they are not a good outdoor potluck option. Indoors and chilled, they are delicious.

I added some pecans and chocolate chips to taste; these bars turned out amazing. I did have to keep it in the oven for a longer time, perhaps 30-35 minutes before it was fully baked through.

Recipe turned out very tasty. I did add cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons of peanut butter mine. Very chewy and sticky, tasted great.

These would be a great mid-afternoon snack for kids or an on the go breakfast. Ingredients can be altered to make it a bit healthier.

Great dessert!  I added almond extract, put in extra vanilla   extract, pecans, cranberries, golden raisins, and cooked the dessert an additional 15 minutes.  Amazing, this is a keeper!!!!  My family loves it.

Made this recipe, as I was looking for some sort of bar to use up leftover ingredients from Christmas baking.  These were to die for!!!!!  I added, white chocolate chips, sea salt caramel chips, Skor bits and diced almonds.  I also drizzled chocolate over the top once they were cooled.  I will definitely be making these next year for my Christmas tins.  Merry Christmas!!!!

These were pretty good, a little dry but that could be because I left out the raisins and added unsweetened coconut. I will make them again with lot of dried cranberries and I think that will make them just right. Did add more spices.

five stars for a snap to prepare, with endless possibilities of add-ins.  tasty, moist and delicious.  used almonds, walnuts, butterscotch, chocolate, and white chocolate chips, and a tsp of espresso powder.  25 min in oven was perfect.  these could be made for a last-minute function.  I did not bother grease/flour the pan; just spayed it with regular cooking spray.  No stick. Used the old fashioned rolled outs out of preference.  I have a couple of apples I want to use up; think I will make this with nuts, apples, and some cinnamon next time.

Made these bars today and they are a definite keeper. They turned out like thick, soft and chewy oatmeal cookies; absolutely delicious! I added raisins and chopped dried cherries to my bars for some added flavor along with tsp cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp ground cloves. In addition; I refrigerated the dough for and hour to solidify the butter and I think that it may have helped improve the texture of the bars?? I will certainly be making these again maybe with dates and pecans...mmmm! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The only thing I changed was putting it into a 9x9 pan because I don't have a 13x9, I figured it would take a little longer to cook, but I cooked it for 30 minutes and it still was super gooey on the inside. I don't mind, so I will eat it, but I am not sure if I will make this one again.

I really like the idea of putting oatmeal into brownies. These were a little too sweet and took longer to cook than indicated. Even so they were still a little gooey in the middle.. However, they were good enough for me to plan to try them again reducing the sugar next time.

Wow, these are the BEST "brownies" I've ever had. Chewy, flavorful, very sweet! ( and I only put in 1 cup of sugar plus a half cup of carob chips). I also used half wheat and half all purpose flour. Next time I'll use all oat flour or another kind of gluten free for a gluten free version. But I like that the non gluten does rise making the dessert very chewy when they cool down.

I halved the recipe and made in an 8x8 pan, and added some mini chocolate chips and a few sprinkles on top for my kids. We all loved it, except my husband who doesn't like oatmeal, this isn't like some baked goods that just sneak in a bit of oats, you can't miss 'em. Very moist and delicious!

After following the recipe exactly, I wound up with doughy blondies.  After reading some comments and tweaking it a bit, I came up with the following for perfect blondies.  I made these blondies with only 1 tsp. of vanilla and replaced 1/2 cup of the butter with shortening.  I baked for 15 minutes at 350* and another 10-12 minutes at 325*.   I added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup chopped pecans.  I also lined the pan with foil and the foil peeled off neatly.

I've made this recipe twice so far. The first time I made it plain without adding any of the optional ingredients. I really liked it that way. But the second time I added about 1 1/2 TBSP of cocoa powder. It's amazing!

Used 1/2 bag chocolate chips. Delicious flavor but I baked around 30 minutes and wish I had taken them out sooner- bet they'd be 5 stars if they were a little gooey

I added big juicy raisins but even they didn't help. I thought it was bland. As one other critique listed, the edges were the best. The rest was too gooey and no flavor :(

This recipe is easy and flexible, but has all the comforts of a treat from grandma's kitchen! I was afraid it was too dry when I spread the dough / batter in the pan, but the butter melted everything together into a roll-your-eyes-in-your-head-good bar. Easy to cut after five minutes and just as delicious over the next two days. I always have the ingredients on hand and it comes together quickly. Got my third batch of the week in the oven right now!

These were so good. I will definitely be making these again. I added 1/4 cup each of raisins and walnuts and just a few chocolate chips for a pleasant surprise. The bars took longer to cook so I left them in the oven with the door slightly ajar for an additional 5 minutes until the centre was cooked as I  didn't want the edges to burn. Did I say these bars were delicious....

Definitely a great base for a traditional oatmeal cookie flavor in bar form.  I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter (because a few reviewers said they were bland), and then melted/marbleized Rolos candy on top.   Yum!

So, I "sort of" made these tonight... I made them mostly off of what I had in the pantry and made some tweaks to adjust for what I was missing. I didn't have any brown sugar so I made them with all white sugar, and added a bit more than called for to adjust for the difference that usually comes with the packed sugar vs. unpacked sugar problem. I also had cocoa powder on hand so I tossed just under a quarter of a cup in as well. 
I didn't toss in any extras, and I cooked in an 11x13 pan for 23 minutes. 
They came out insane!
I'm notoriously bad at any kind of brownie/blondie from scratch, they usually end up more like cake, but this one is pure brownie complete with the crinkly top. 
I will definitely be attempting to make these the proper way/according to the recipe soon.

Awesome! The only changes I made are: I ground the rolled oats in the food processor, not as fine at flour. Measure first, process next. And I added 1.5 cups chopped walnuts and 1.5 cups chocolate chips.

This was lovely, but very humble. I made with dark chocolate chunks, toffee bits, and walnut halves (not chopped, because I like encountering a lengthy passage of nut ruminations lol). I had one, but my daughter wasn't even tempted to try them, so probably not a kid treat. I will probably bring them over to my mom, who will love them. I won't make again, but they really were lovely.

Very good! Have made them a couple times.  Have made them plain, but am going to add walnuts and raisins next time.

I was really excited to make these! And I am afraid to say I kind of hated them because they were dry and cakey. I was really confused and re-read the directions and the ingredients to make sure I didn't miss or mis-measure something. But they did not turn out well. The flavor itself was okay and it was just fine on sweetness. Was pretty disappointed but thinking it may have been a fluke based on other reviews.

Fantastic! My family gobbled them up! I thought the dough was a little too gooey, but they came out great. The only change I made was I used 1 cup of wheat flour and a half cup of white flour. I left them closer to 25 minutes as the center was a little soft.

Super yummy and easy to make! I cook them for about 25 minutes so the edges and top are brown. Crispy on the outside, soft brownie texture on the inside.

I made the half batch as recommended by another reviewer. Added chocolate chips. Life expectancy on these will be very short.

I added sliced almonds, flaked coconut and neon dinosaur sprinkles (because really, how can you go wrong with neon dino sprinkles?). I added some flaxseed and swapped 1/2 of one teaspoon of vanilla extract for 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. This is the second time I have made these with these additions and they've been very popular. Delicious!!

I made these tonight, and they turned out quite well. I halved the recipe, aside from the oatmeal. I used 11/4 cups instant oats, and added one chopped bar of semi-sweet baking chocolate. I also used dark brown sugar, since it was what I had on hand. I definitely will make these again, but with the light brown sugar. The dark brown leaves too much of the molasses flavor. Would be great a variety of different ways, and I'm excited to experiment. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were so good!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY (which is odd for me) didn't use any of the optional add ins because I just didn't have them. Tastes just like a perfect blondie with oatmeal, love them! Will definitely make again, probably try some chocolate chips even though it's not needed.

Yummy. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I added one cup of chocolate chips and after baking for 25 minutes, turned the oven down to 300 and baked another 10 minutes. Not really a brownie; it's more like a bar.

These are a great oatmeal bar cookie base. I added a cup of chopped pecans, a cup of dried cranberries, and a little cinnamon. Next time, I'd cut the sugar, add all of that plus some white chocolate chunks.

I made this just as the recipe stated (except quick oats instead of whole rolled oats) and I added 1 cup of the "optional" chocolate chips.  It was delicious!  I can't imagine making it without the chocolate chips.  It tasted devine.  Very rich, but so delicious!

I made no substitutions but did add mini chocolate chips. I had to bake about 38 minutes and they are still very gooey and moist but with a nice crispy top. These aren't really a "brownie", they're more of a bar cookie or Blondie but they are so delicious and addictive! Next time I make them I'll reduce the sugar a bit and add dried fruit and some nuts so it can be a good healthy oatmeal breakfast bar recipe.

I made this as listed, and without any add-ins. Though they needed A LOT more baking time than suggested, they are subtle and tasty. I am thinking of adding a chocolate topping to half of the batch tomorrow, but I do also like them as is.

It doesn't say how to test to see if it's cooked all the way through and I don't know.  Cooking time should have been at least 10 minutes longer.  The edges are okay but it's not done at all in the middle.  It's too bad because I hate that I wasted all those ingredients.

One of my delicious go to favorites!  I always have these ingredients on hand to bake with.  I wanted to make cookies however I did not have the time so I looked up quick desserts, fantastic! These are more like a pan cookie then a brownie.  I love it when I share a dessert I've made and have several request for the recipe!

This is a very good brownie recipe.  I added a 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and and 1/4 cup butterscotch chips, which was very good.  I think some chopped walnuts or pecans would have been very good, too!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was absolutely delicious, I added 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and it was the perfect amount. I will say this gets 4 stars just because it was more of a big cookie than a brownie. The entire family loved it though?

Very good, chewy, hearty texture. I cut the vanilla to one tsp, and added 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves. Threw in a huge handful of Craisins to make oatmeal cranberry bars. The spice complements the oats to satisfying perfection. 22 minutes made for a soft, chewy center, and edges that were a bit firmer. They cut neatly for an attractive presentation. Combine that with a quick, super easy preparation and you have a winning recipe undeniably worthy of inclusion in your recipe box.

I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was undercooked at the 25 min mark so I left it in and checked every 5 min. At 35 min I took it out. It was no longer gooey and very dry. It's more like oatmeal cake.

I made these last night - SO good! I followed the recipe and added about a half bag of Hershey's mini chocolate chips. It just looked like a full bag would be too much (and it would've been). When I took them out of the oven, they looked really puffy, almost like a cake, but once they cooled a bit, they took on the structure of a brownie. They are delicious warm or cold the next day! I'll definitely make them again.

Delicious!  My only add-ins were a teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup of Craisins.  I only like to serve the best at church functions.

they are baking right now, my only concern is if i added too much walnuts and chocolate chips. There was no measurements for any of those or the oatmeal so i added 1/2 a cup of everything. Hopefully they turn out good.

5 Stars from my Men and they have gotten very critical due to how much I bake! I followed the recipe exactly, but did not add any chocolate chips or fruit or nuts. Lightly sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the raw dough before baking. Used Butter Pam to coat the pan, no flour. Per another Reviewer, Cooked it for 20 min. at 350 and 8 additional minutes at 325. The house smelled amazing. Half the tray is already gone! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a keeper! I love the oatmeal taste. I used coconut oil instead of butter and white whole wheat instead of all-purpose flour. As optional ingredients I added a cup of shredded coconut and about a cup of Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chips. The taste and texture were wonderful; dense and not too crumbly for me. I cannot wait to make this again. I am probably going to add ground flaxseed and experiment with coconut flour.

I love this recipe! It was quick and easy. I used shortening instead of butter and added a Hershey's chocolate bar to it. It was so good! I plan on making this again soon and playing with the different added ingredients as suggested. This will be one of my favorite baking recipes. Thank you Milly for such a recipe.

This recipe was great and easy! I wasn't quite what this would turn out like but it's delicious. It very much had the consistency of a blondie but with oatmeal. I went ahead and added crushed pecan but it would've been great without too.

Oh, my...these are good! I added mini chocolate chips, dried cranberries (for a bit of tart), and chopped pecans. What a great flavor combo. Next time, I think I may try chopped Rolo candies with chocolate chips.

These were excellent & I can see making them on a regular basis.  
Who doesn't love blondies?  I added chocolate chips but next time I'm adding some dried fruit & butterscotch chips. Thanks for the recipe Milly!

My family loves these! I've made them with no add ins and they are wonderful! We have had them for breakfast and also for dessert. We added a small spoonful of cookie dough (eggless of coarse) and a small scoop of ice cream on them and this has beaten out any chocolate brownies ever! About to make some more now!

I made these gluten free with gluten free AP flour in place of regular AP flour and the addition of 1/2tsp of xantham gum.  I halved the recipe but I shouldn't have because my kids devoured these when I turned around to take a picture. I did not add anything in and don't plan to in the future. They were perfect as is.

I have made these a few times and will soon lose count because I want to make them again and again. They have just the right amount of sweetness and they're perfectly chewy. I'm just getting into baking and until I can find something I like just as much, I will keep going back to this recipe.

ORIGINAL REVIEW 5/14: I'd agree with others that this is a bar cookie, not a brownie. But it doesn't matter because it's delicious. It's actually just like my oatmeal raisin cookie recipe, only way easier to make -- I added a 1/4 cup of golden raisins, 1 Tablespoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. I thought it tasted like a bowl of buttery porridge. I use salted butter, so along with the baking soda, I found the addition of so much salt to be too much, but my mother didn't think so; next time I think I'll leave out the salt. I asked my mother if she wanted to add anything to my review and she said, "They were very good. It's all I can do not to eat them all at once!" UPDATE 5/15: I halved the recipe this time to fit into a 9x9-in. pan. We agreed that there weren't enough oats nor raisins last time, so I increased the ratio of both [using 1+1/2 cups of oats and 1/4 cup of raisins for the halved recipe]. I only added a pinch of salt this time. It took 20 minutes for the top of this smaller pan of bars to get golden brown, so I took it out, figuring that if the center wasn't done enough my mom could pop it in the microwave or toaster oven.

I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan but other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  It came out great! I did add the optional ingredients (walnuts, chocolate chips and raisins) since I had them on hand and they really blended well in the recipe. My family loved it and I think it'll disappear pretty quickly!

This tasted good but it was way too crumbly. I'm wondering if maybe it shouldn't  have had both baking soda and baking powder in it, because it rose a lot. I loved that it tasted like cookies, but the texture just didn't work well for me.

So good. My teen daughter baked the organic version yesterday and they were a huge hit. She substituted equal amount coconut oil for the butter, and shredded coconut for the chocolate chips. These definitely are a bar as opposed to a brownie, but either or, super delicious!

I made these with chocolate chips and walnuts. The brownies sunk after they were baked but this was not a problem.  They are soft, chewy, and yummy.  Like a really soft oatmeal cookie bar!

While I stuck with chocolate chips (I have a bunch I'm the house), I can see these for being a fabulous base for any number of add-ins.  The base is sweet but not overpoweringly so, and will match up well with any number of different things!  Looking forward to experimenting next time!

These oatmeal brownies were delicious.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of coconut.  My husband loved them.  I don't think they will last very long in our house.  Thanks for the recipe.

I would make this recipe way back in the 60's.  Raising 4 kids on an Iowa dairy farm, didn't have time to make cookies so spread the batter out on a cookie sheet and called them "The Great Oatmeal Bar".  They went fast with a glass of cold milk !!  We had to ration the kids to one gallon of milk a day !!  ~ Doris ~

These are easy to make and very tasty.  I didn't have anything exciting to put in them (like chocolate chips) so I added a couple teaspoons of cinnamon.  I think I underbaked them a bit, but they are moist and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I followed the instructions as given, but I used white chocolate chips and Zante currants instead of the other options listed. The dough tasted heavenly -- very nice vanilla flavor. I tasted a sample cookie when the pan was still warm, and I wasn't so sure; but once the pan had cooled and sat for a while, the cookies were perfect. I can imagine using this basic recipe as a springboard for many variations.

Delicious, easy, wonderful!  Added 1/2 c. ground almond for a nutty taste. Yum!

these were amazing and chewy bars. I added some raisins, mini choc. chips and a little coconut. Had to cook for 40 minutes.
