Great idea!  Overall not too bad.  The cake was a bit gooey/sticky (from the applesauce no doubt) and a touch dry.   I would recommend finding a substitute for some or all of the applesauce.

I made these cakes and shipped them to my son while he was Iraq for his birthday.  He loved them!  So much he did not use the frosting or sprinkles he packed with them.  Plan on baking another batch for his wife who is stationed at Fort Hood for her birthday
