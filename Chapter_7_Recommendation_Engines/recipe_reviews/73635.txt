A nice bread!  I personally would add  a bit more salt and more maple to up the flavor.  I also want to add that if you are having trouble with your wheat breads rising try adding in some Vital Wheat Gluten Flour, it's available in most grocery stores in the baking aisle.  In this recipe I replaced 1/4 cup of white flour with the wheat gluten and I got a lovely loaf of bread.  With using the Vital Wheat Gluten Flour I have success with even true 100% whole wheat breads.  I also prefer to bake my bread in my oven.  I use the dough cycle on bread machine and remove dough and knead a few times, maybe 10, on a floured board, shape and place in a greased bread pan.  Let rise, check every 10-15 minutes until desired height.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.  If you can resist ;)  let bread cool a bit before slicing or the loaf gets kinda squished.

I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 c rolled oats and 1/2 c bread flour.

I also used 3/4 c apple juice and 1/2 c water instead of 1 1/4 c water because we tend to like our bread sweeter.
The bread is a touch moist, but has a great texture and is VERY tasy.

I was getting tired of the dense bread that I was getting from my breadmaker, until I tried this recipe.  Such a lovely soft texture, perfect for P&J sandwiches.

This is a very nicely flavored loaf. A little fluff, good crumb, just a great recipe for an everyday loaf. Only thing I did different was use melted butter because I am all out of oil. I used my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end. I warmed my maple syrup with the water to the right temp to proof with my yeast in my mixer bowl. After ten minutes, I added the melted butter, then all the dry ingredients. I had to add at least another 1/4 c. of flour, but that's only because I think the weather was wetter. I kneaded with my bread hook for about five minutes or so, then set in a large greased bowl covered with saran wrap and a towel on a warm oven to rise for an hour. After it had doubled, I pounded it down and shaped into a loaf and set it to rise in an xl loaf pan for a half hour or so. I baked it at 350* for about 40 minutes. I don't usually time bread as I've gotten to know about when it smells ready. Very good bread. This one is going to be made regularly. I love how the flavor fools you a bit, because even though you know it's maple.....you still think it might be something else. This would be a great base for cinnamon bread. NOTE: This is even better the next day, warmed a bit, slathered in butter and drizzled with real maple syrup. Pure heaven.

There should not be more wheat flour than bread flour if you want your bread to rise more.  Too much wheat flour is what makes bread so dense.  Try adjusting the flour if your complaint is the density.

This has become our new basic homemade bread.  I vary the amount of maple syrup based on the grade of syrup I currently have on hand. It is very easy to cut into sandwhich sized slices and my husband loves it for his breakfast sandwhich before work.  I mix it in the bread machine and bake it in the oven as other reviewers have suggested, most breads fall in my bread machine if I bake them in it, so it is pretty standard for me to  use it just for mixing anyway.  The recipe is so simple I memorized it after just a few times of baking it so I can easily make it a couple of times a week.

SO good...with modifications. The lack of salt in this recipe could be to blame for all the problems other reviewers have had with the bread being dense, not rising or falling. I increased the salt to 1 tsp. I also reduced the liquid to 1 cup and used milk instead of water. When the beep sounded on my breadmaker I added chopped almonds. Delicious!! Fluffy, just sweet enough, and makes a killer egg salad sandwich the next day! :-)

This bread had a great maple taste and a spongy texture. However, I've tried making it twice - the second time with more yeast and both times I've ended up with a short, dense loaf. I probably won't make it again.

There is too much wheat flour in the recipe and not enough white flour.. Also too much water.. 1 cup of water is all that is needed.

This bread was excellent! I'm not sure why some reviewers thought it was so dense. I've baked numerous whole wheat loaves over the years and this is one of the lightest versions I've ever made. I usually bake all of my bread by hand, reserving the bread machine for when I'm feeling truly lazy or pressed for time, but I did this whole recipe in the bread machine and it did not disappoint! This is one of our new favorites!  Please don't omit the bread flour (not all-purpose). I think it really adds to the great texture of this bread. I did do as another reviewer suggested and substituted 1/2 cup of rolled oats for 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour.  The only other change I made was to substitute safflower oil for most of the olive oil, since I ran out of the latter.  My other half loved it, saying it reminded him exactly of a certain bread he used to buy when he was in college.

This bread is so soft and moist.  The maple flavour is not there but it does add a touch of sweetness without using refind sugar. I used all 100% organic flour, this recipe does not need white flour to make it light. I mixed the dough in my bread machine and then placed the mixed dough in my bread pan to rise again for about 40 minutes.  It baked up light anf fluffy, so yummy right out of the oven.  This is our favorite bread now.

My biggest complaint about this bread is how bland it tasted to me.The next time I make this I'll add 1 tsp. of salt.But even with it being bland I couldn't detect any maple syrup taste at all.

I feel bad about giving this recipe such a  low rating, but, to be honest, it wasn't all that good! I think I'm going to keep looking for the "perfect bread recipe."
Thanks anyway! :)

This is a nice moist, tasty loaf that's not too sweet.  As a vegan I appreciate that there's no honey, butter, or milk required and using pure maple syrup (not the high fructose corn syrup flavored like syrup) as a sweetener instead of white sugar is a bonus.  You could also substitute agave.  I will make this again for sure -- my kids loved it toasted with jam and peanut butter.

Best whole wheat bread I have ever had. Used butter instead of oil and added 4 tsp of Vital Wheat Gluten. Loaf was lite and air. I will add 1/2 tsp of Vanilla next time.

I used all whole wheat flour and canola oil. Excellant flavor and texture and it raised nicely until it began to bake it sunk in the middle. Looked like a bread bowl when it finished baking. I've used a bread machine for many years and I've never had anything like this happen.  I'm not sure why this happened. Does anyone know?

Absolutely Wonderful.  I have never ever ever ever had a "Bread Machine" receipe in which the bread turned out sooooooo light and airy.  This is great.  I used 6 tabl. of maple syrup and this is still a very light maple flavoring.  Loved this receipe.

I loved this bread, made it with Mrs Butterworths syrup but I do think it would be better with real Maple Syrup. I will up the syrup next time if I don't have the real stuff again. But was wonderful, looks great and taste great.

I read most of the reviews and altered my recipe a little, it turned it really good.  I used 2c white wheat flour and 1c bread flour and added 5 tbsp of maple syrup.  The extra syrup made it taste like a sweet wheat bread, but not like maple.  I also added about 2 tbsp of vital wheat gluten, it made the bread lite and fluffy.  I also baked it in the oven instead of the bread machine.  I will definitely try this loaf again.

I agree with the reviewers who said this bread is too wet.  I've made it twice now, thinking the goopy inside was just a fluke the first time, but it happened again the second time.  I do like the simplicity and the maple flavor of this healthy bread, so I will give it ONE more shot with less water and hope for the best.  Also, I upped the salt to 1 tsp.

I gave this bread 4 out of 5 because it is good but I did make a few changes.  I only used 1 cup of water, increased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and added 4 teaspoons wheat gluten to help it rise more and not have such a heavy loaf.  Next time I will increase the salt to 1 teaspoon and maybe even add a little more maple syrup. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this bread!  This has become my go-to bread to make with dinner because I really love to use whole wheat.  This bread comes out moist with a hint of sweatness ( I use 5 tbls of syrup instead of 4). My family gets whole wheat and I get to feed them something healthy!  Win Win!

Yummy! It did not quite get done all the way, in the middle, so I would put "dark" for crust control next time.

Based on Tat2's review I decided to make this bread.  I followed the recipe, but I only used 1 cup of water since it is very humid here today.  It baked up beautifully.  We made BLTs with garden fresh produce and my DD commented that she thought I had bought the bread at the bakery.  I also did not use a bread machine.  And I slso will be making this again.

This was my first time making bread in my new bread machine, and this recipe was a fantastic way to begin. Following reviewer, vo0do0's suggestion, I used 1/2 cup quick oats, 3/4 cup apple cider and 1/2 c water instead of 1 1/4 cups water; and, following reviewer, BrittBliss's suggestion, I used 1 cup of Bread Flour (to increase height), and 1- 1/2 cups Whole Wheat flour. I also used 6 Tablespoons of high grade Maple Syrup, and added 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds. The bread has a slightly crunchy and definitely chewy crust and is wonderfully soft and fluffy inside! Perfect for sandwiches, or toasted or even alone! I ate it toasted with an egg on top. Excellent - eggcellent ;) -! The apple cider made it sweeter, and added flavor so it's a savory sweet bread -- but not too sweet. Though, I imagine it'd be great for French Toast. It's an awesome recipe. Thank you, Envision, and other reviewers! :)  Update: I've made this bread 6 times now, and everyone who eats it, loves it! It's a staple now. :)

I made this for the first time and it fell.  But the taste was so good that I will try until I find out what I did wrong.  Probable just the humidity.

This is delicious!  I have tried lots of bread recipies from this site and I think this one is a new favorite.  I wasn't sure about giving it a try because of the mixed reviews, but it was well worth it.  Followed the recipe except increased salt to 1 tsp, increased maple syrup to 6T and kept the flour ratios the same.  Made on the dough cycle of my bread machine and baked in the oven at 350 for 35 - 40 min.  The loaf rose well, even without the addition of any dough enhancer.  Maple flavor wasn't overpowering at all, but you could tell it was an ingredient.  It went well with the pot roast and veggies I made for dinner.  I will definitely make this again!  Love it!

I am FAR from a baker. I have limited success in baking but this bread came out GREAT! I used wheat bread setting, added 2 more tablespoons of maple syrup and i was very pleased with the results. Even a NON baker as myself had success!

Not ready in 5 minutes - maybe ready to cook but the whole wheat cycle takes about 4 hours, even the dough cycle is 90 minutes... someone ought to check that!!  I found this was better with the addition of vital wheat gluten or King Arthur Dough Improver, either of which will give a better rise.

This is great!  Tried it for the first time and came out perfect. It was tasty and the texture was softer than other whole wheat breads  I’ve tried.   I used the exact proportion of whole wheat flour and  bread flour as in the recipe.  However I put in 1tsp salt, 5 Tablespoons of  pure maple syrup and 1 ¼ cups milk instead of water.  Put it in my bread machine under the dough cycle.  When dough was ready I kneaded it just for a few minutes and  allowed the dough to rise for about an hour. Baked it @ 350 deg for  35mins. It smelled so good and tasted even better. Cutting the bread was easy too as the loaf  held quite well eventhough it was still warm from the oven as hubby and I couldn’t wait to try it.  We were impressed.  Will definitely keep this recipe!

I thought this bread was ok.  Rose to the top of the bread machine.  Maple flavor not overpowering.  I agree with other reviewers who described the bread as lighter in texture or having more "fluff" which is probably why I wouldn't make it again.  I found that the bread tore when I tried to spread cold butter on it, even when I had shaved off very thin pieces of butter.  I much prefer the Buttermilk Honey Wheat Bread from this site.

I have tried about a dozen different whole wheat recipes and this one has the best texture. It is light and moist and stays fresh longer.  I make 2 different variations. One I add 6 Tbs sun flower seeds, 4 Tbs flax seeds and 2 Tbs oats.  In the other I add 3/4 Cup chopped walnuts, 2Tbs poppy seeds, 3Tbs flax seeds and enough fun flower seeds to bring it to 1 1/4 cups nuts.  Both variations are excellent!

I made this the first time last night in my breadmaker. Usually wheat bread in the breadmaker comes out really dense and heavy. This one came out perfect. I am eating it right now and absolutely love it. VERY IMPRESSED with this recipe. I love the fact it doesn't have alot of ingredients making it quick to throw in the breadmaker pan. Thanks for sharing

Fantastic!  We loved the recipe. We actually bought maple ham to make sandwiches! I added approx 1/8-1/4 more flour as it mixed.  I also did not have bread flour, so I used all purpose flour with a tsp of gluten.  The bread has a nice texture, rose nicely, and has a light taste.  My husband really liked the bread (and he does not like anything that could be healhty) and he ate most of it before I got home from shool :)

I made this recipe exactly as written.  (I used the 2 lb loaf setting  on the bread machine - the directions didn't say whether it was for a 1 lb, 1 1/2 lb, or 2 lb loaf.)  The flavor was good, but the loaf looked like a brick.  And it was soggy inside.  I put it in the oven at 350 for 15 extra minutes hoping it would do something that would resemble bread a little more... I ate a few slices anyway with some peanut butter and jelly.  I might try it again and follow some tweaks by other readers.

While this may not be to everyone's taste, we love it. It's a delightfully soft bread, but not a problem to slice if your bread knife is up to the job. I increased the salt to a half teaspoonful (only 100mg a slice! Great for those of us who have to watch our salt intake) and as I hate cup measures, 320 grams of wholemeal flour seems to work perfectly. I also substitute a quarter cup of bread flour with wheat gluten to help the texture. (Small measures of volume are not so critical). This recipe certainly disproves those who say bread won't rise well unless half the flour is white.

This bread was very YUMMY!  Set it in the bread machine timer to cook while we were out working all day and came home to this great smell, but it int he refrigerator overnight and cut it up the next day.  Making it again today.  Not too sweet, just right.

I didn't have an awesome experience with this recipe. I added the extra salt and maple but realized that increased my ratio of liquids and the dough was very sloppy. I added flour until my dough became a soft ball but the amount of dough was too much for my bread machine. I split the dough and finished the second one in then oven after a couple rises. THey both came out although a bit misshapen.  The taste was ok, nothing to be excited about. I'll keep looking for a recipe...

This is the best wheat bread recipe I've made in my bread maker. The only change I made was increasing the bread flour to 1 cup and decreasing the wheat flour to 2 cups. It makes a less dense bread which is what I wanted for sandwiches and toasting.
Will definitely use this recipe again.

My whole family loves this bread. I make it in the machine from start to finish. I use only 100% whole wheat, and I add 1Tbsp. vital wheat gluten to the recipe. It bakes up light every time. I'm not sure why some folks are having trouble with density. Baking it in the oven rather than the machine might help with that, though.

I made this last night in my bread machine.  I have a White-Westinghouse that is about 12 years old.  It is a beautiful, tasty loaf of wheat bread that turned out perfect. Thanks!  I plan to add flax seed in my next one.

Slightly sweet with a hint of maple.  How wonderful!  I added a touch more salt and maple syrup.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then punched the dough down, placed in a greased bread pan and let rise for 40 minutes.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  It was great buttered and with a bowl of soup.  Also makes a great slice of toast!

This looked beautiful and was very moist but very bland. Definitely needs more salt or the addition of alot of butter.

Absolutely delicious. I used my machine's wheat cycle with light crust setting and it came out well. No changes to the recipe. It does not have a "maple" flavor, just a simple wheat bread.

Very tasty loaf, I cooked in the oven and changed the recipe a little by using the 2c wheat and 1c bread flour and I also used 1/2t of salt.

My son was recently diagnose with a sugar allergy, so now I've had to make my own bread, and this recipe is a HIT with everyone! I used 2 cups wholewheat bread flour, and 1 cup white bread flour. Nice and soft bread, including the crust. I agree with other cooks, that you can't taste the maple syrup, but it will be my bread recipe from now on!

This bread is very good...no changes necessary....and although you can't taste maple syrup, the flavour is nicer than a honey loaf.

A good basic wheat bread. There really wasn't much of a maple flavor and I'd rather use something cheaper (sugar, agave, honey, whatever) to sweeten the bread since there wasn't that strong flavor I was hoping for. Otherwise it was a good bread. Nice texture. It seems like this bread would be easy to modify with seeds or whatever you'd like to add. The only change I made was I used 3c of whole wheat flour and omitted the bread flour.

I have to say it was good, even up here at 8,888 feet!  All I did was increase the salt to 1 tsp. which inhibits the yeast a bit.

I was hoping for more maple taste.  This turned out for me to basically just be a loaf of whole wheat bread.  Maybe next time I'll try more maple or pure maple.

Oh my goodness...this bread is delicious!  I changed the recipe a bit:  I used 2 cups wheat flour/one cup bread flour, decreased the water to one cup, increased salt to 1 t., and increased maple syrup to 6 T.  I used the dough setting only in my bread machine (I never bake in it), and when the cycle was done, kneaded and shaped it, put in a loaf pan, and let it rise for 40 minutes.  I then baked at 375 for 30  minutes.  My husband, who's not a wheat bread fan, loved it as well.  Score!

Bread is complicated.  Maybe my yeast was a tad old.  Didn't seem to have any flavor (except tinge of olive oil).  I would prefer more salt for flavor, but then needs more sugar and yeast.  My loaf was coarse and dense, like a doorstop.  I think in someone else's kitchen it might be fine!

I followed the instructions and made this in my bread machine, but it collapsed.  I loved the taste, moistness and density, but came up with a very small loaf.  Troubleshooting guide from my bread machines says it could have been not enough yeast or sugar.  Not sure which one to modify.

Made this loaf several times with great success! The tweeks I made were: 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour and 1 cup Better for Bread Flour, I also changed the Olive Oil to softened Real Butter, Maple Syrup is 1/4 cup and must be at room temp. I used the Wheat Bread option for a 1.5lb loaf at medium color. Best I've found yet!

Excellent bread! So soft and moist, especially for a whole wheat bread.  I did add about 1/4 cup more bread flour  because it was looking rather sticky, and turned out great. It has a nice sweet flavour to it with the maple syrup in it.  My new favour whole wheat bread!

Pretty good but not great.  I made according to the recipe but think next time I will use 1 and 1/2 times the maple syrup, 1/3 of vital wheat gluten, 1/3 of a cup of wheat flakes and lighten the whole wheat about a half a cup.  It was close to really good but not quite there.  Thanks for sharing.

After reading the other reviews,  I added 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/3 teaspoon.  I also added 2 extra tablespoons of maple syrup.  The bread turned out excellent.

The first time I made this bread I followed the directions as written. And turned out pretty good. I don't care for bread that is all or mostly whole wheat. I made it again except this time I tweaked it a little. The result ended with a five star rating. I used 2 cups whole wheat and one cup bread flour. I added a heaping teaspoon of diastatic malt powder because it gives bread an artisan flavor. I used rice milk instead of water and I doubled the salt. The result was a light and airy whole wheat bread that has a tender, flaky crust. It's magnificient! This recipe is vegan-friendly if you substitute the butter with olive oil. I also added 2 tsp of vital wheat gluten which is essential for whole grain breads.

This bread had really good flavor, Not to maple-ish. My kids loved it.  I did have a hard time getting it to rise tho, and ended up needing to add gluten flour the second time I made it and it rose nicely for me.

A SUPERIOR LOAF!!! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great!!!! MUST USE REAL MAPLE SYRUP!!!! I can't imagine anyone actually using an artificially flavored syrup, the purist in me requires me to say this!! Did turn out light as opposed to other WW breads. Will make again and again, will be a home counter staple!!

My family loved this recipe. I made the dough in my machine and let it rise once. I Then let it rise again in my loaf pans and finished it in the oven at 350. It is dense and tasty.
