It was pretty good, but too sweet for my taste.  All that pineapple juice just made the sweetness a little overwhelming.

This is a perfect drink to share with friends on a cold Winter’s day. I offered guests the opportunity to “spike” their drink with either Peach Schnapps or Fireball!

Best apple cider ever! I used Trader Joes (already) Spiced Cider and followed this recipe as written but adding an extra 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. The citrus flavors came through beautifully. My family and I enjoyed this!
