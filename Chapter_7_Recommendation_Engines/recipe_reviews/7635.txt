Pandan has an excellent and unique taste.  I originally tried making the paste myself using Pandan leaves, but it's difficult to get the flavour to come out of the leaves.  Use Pandan extract instead.

This recipe is challenging!  The multi-layers take time and patience.  I would have rated the recipe higher, but my cake didn't turn out too well (tasty though)!

*update* My Malaysian mother-in-law hates the pandan extract, although I thought it wasn't too bad.  We also managed to find canned pandan filling at a Missasagua Asian grocery, although it's not easy to find and not always stocked.  Check the canned fruits section.
