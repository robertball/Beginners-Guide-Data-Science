I followed the recipe except I used 2oz of chocolate and 1oz of white chocolate for the topping. This cake is very lite and moist. Delicious! The chocolate flavor was a little strong for my taste. I would use a bit less next time. The coffee gave a nice flavor. The figs are very subtle and don't have the figgy texture at all. I think I'll use a bit more figs next time. My daughter had two pieces and she doesn't like cake.

Nice cake -- not too sweet, very moist, rich chocolate flavor.

I reduced the butter to 3/4 cups and added about 1/3 cup of applesauce, to make it *slightly* healthier :) It worked really well.
