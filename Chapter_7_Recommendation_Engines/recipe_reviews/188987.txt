This is a good recipe, so I'm puzzling over the lack of reviews but the low rating.  It's been in my recipe box for months to try, and the entire time it's been rated 1 star; today, it was changed to 3 stars.  I'm finding that very confusing.  The instructions for this recipe are perfect.  The bread itself is a pretty plain egg bread and the filling is very easy and quick to make.  I would add garlic next time and maybe halve the recipe itself without halving the filling, bc this makes a lot of bread.  It's just the two of us in this house, though, so for a family it would probably be fine.  I didn't make a ring bc I didn't roll out the dough enough, but I did twist it and it was quite pretty.  Bf wasn't thrilled with the bread itself (he thought it was dry--probably my fault since I baked it at 375 for 45 min), and I think it needs more filling, but otherwise this is a nice bread that looks beautiful when cut.  I think it deserves at least 4 stars.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this a few times now and it always turns out really well.  Experimented with the same dough but with a diced apple, cinnamon and a little brown sugar for the filling.  It is OMG good!

Thank you for the great review. I absolutely LOVE this bread. My sister in Law gave it to me. She was always making variations. She passed away last week from Lung Cancer. I am making this again for a family get to gether in honor of her.

This bread has been a family tradition since the early 80's. Found the recipe in an old magazine that use to show step by step how to make things. Everyone LOVES it & really looks forward to me making it every year now for Thanksgiving. I would advise letting the butter/poppy seed mixture cool in the refrigerator before spreading it on the dough. If it's warm it'll run into the edges causing the bread not to seal properly. Also I use 1/2 C butter instead of the oil. This bread smells so good baking too.

This was very tasty!  I cooked the onions beforehand and this was a mistake, they disinagrated.  I should have followed the directions and left uncooked.  Flavorfull, pretty and easy to make.  Thank you for this recipe.

Made this yesterday and it’s very good.  As I was kneading the dough it was starting to feel dry so I didn’t end up using all the flour.  After shaping the ring I had to go out unexpectedly, so it ended up rising for 6 hours and went shapeless.  Nonetheless, this gave it a light and flake
