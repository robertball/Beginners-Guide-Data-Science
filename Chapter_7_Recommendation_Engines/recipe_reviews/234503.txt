I made some changes so this is hard to rate but I will do my best. I am not a fan of cream of soups...AT ALL. But, I had most all of the ingredients minus the cream of mushroom and I was craving soup so I decided to give it a go. Glad I did because this was down right delicious. Salty but delicious. My main change was that I knew 3 cans of cream of mushroom was just too much for my liking so I replaced one of the cans of soup with broth. My other change is that I only had red bell instead of green (no biggie) but I only had half of one so I threw in a carrot to make up for my lack of bell. My cooked chicken was actually leftover grilled chicken and it added a ton of flavor. This soup was excellent and full of flavor except for the fact it was too salty. I recommend using reduced sodium soup and broth too. Ditch one of the cans of cream of mushroom and thin it out with low sodium chicken broth in place of the water. The rice also cooks in 30 minutes so 2 hours is not needed either. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this one and I will definitely use it again with my tweaks.

I did not use bacon and only used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup since I read other comments about being overly salty.  Also, I started out with about 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and saut√©ed onion and celery first.  Then added chopped carrots and about 4 cups homemade chicken broth (lightly salted) and some poultry seasoning and salted to taste.  With all these changes it turned out perfect and plenty salty.  I will make again using these changes.

I thought it would be a bit bland so I added a bit of seasoning, such as oregano and parsley, and a bit of garlic. It liked the combination of the flavours, but found it was too salty with all the bacon. I chopped up a potato and threw it in to soak up some of the salt - hopefully that helps! I would probably cook it with a potato or two next time.

It may be an old recipe, but its new to me. I reduced the servings in half and left out the green pepper(don't really like them). My husband and I liked it very much. Had it with fresh bread--YUM
