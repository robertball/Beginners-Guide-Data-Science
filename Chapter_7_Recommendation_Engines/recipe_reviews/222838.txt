This was a super easy cake to make and tastes delicious. I personally don't think the recipe needs any adjustments.

This cake is awesome!  If you like strawberry-rhubarb pie, you will love this cake.  I did use raspberry jello instead of strawberry because it is the only one I had.  If strawberry makes it better I would eat the whole cake.  I absolutely LOVE this cake.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

This cake was easy and very tasty.  I only had a funfetti cake at home so I used that.  It came out beautiful since the chips were red in color.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.

Instead of the white cake mix, I used strawberry. It was pretty sweet so next time I may use sugar free jello. Also had some tapioca that didn't dissolve too well at first but overnight it seemed to disappear.

I used my late spring rhubarb to make this cake. The only substitution I made was to use a small box of sugar-free strawberry jello instead of the regular. A winner!

It was very well received.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  Some of the rhubarb stuck to the bottom of the pan when I tipped it out.  I took it out with a rubber spatula and spread it on the vacant spots.
I wish there was a way to get the strawberry flavor without using jello.  I could smell the chemically smell of the jello mix.  Most people would not.

Made it with half rhubarb and half strawberries as they were in season. Grandkids loved it. It freezes well,  and we will be making this a lot. I think any fruit would work with this recipe, maybe change the jello flavour to suit the fruit.

Fantastic recipe. I substituted 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the 3 tablespoons of tapioca pudding the recipe called for and it turned out great. Thank you. 
Oh, and a dollop of whipped cream is a great finishing touch.

Lots of people going back for seconds. I was able to cut it up at home and it still looked great.  I added blueberries to the top for the 4th of July effect and the top was sticky enough for them to stay put. But it also stuck to the bottom of the pan and had to scrape off and reapply. Maybe wax paper would help?
