This recipe is so popular! It is amazing that people who are hesitant about caviar taste it and are instantly fans! I would suggest putting the caviar into a paper towel so that any liquid will be absorbed. This way the appearance of the appetizer will be better when you add it. Good in cold as well as warm weather. This is a good one!

Quite honestly this looked a great deal more impressive than it tasted. We liked it fine but will chose a tastier treat next time we want to splurge.

Only one of the best! I add a little yellow mustard to make it a little more devilish...

Yes. But always Drain the Caviar-before you put it on top.

I didn't make any changes in this recipe. I've made it 3 times. Each time everyone seemed to really like it. It was mostly gone when I gathered up everything. I made it once for my board Christmas party it is very elegant and also very down to earth take your pick. I really like it.

My one suggestion is that if you are taking this somewhere... wait until you get there to add and spread the caviar. It tends to tint the white areas a light gray (and that blows your presentation). This is a great recipe. Even people who aren't really wild about caviar seem to like it.
