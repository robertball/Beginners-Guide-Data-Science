Great recipe.  I didn't have exactly the right ingredients, I didn't have sesame oil, dry sherry or minced ginger.  I replaced the sesame oil with veg oil, white vinegar for the sherry, and ground ginger for the minced.  It turned out amazing.

My husband loved this sauce so much, he said he would rather have this than go out to our favorite asian restaurant. We were looking for a garlic stir fry sauce, so I nearly tripled the garlic and followed the remaining suggestions of others: cutting the corn starch in half, adding only a fraction of the corn syrup, being generous on the red pepper flakes, and increasing the ginger by about half. This is definitely a keeper that we'll use often.

I halved this, but felt there was too much cornstarch - it came out thick. Would recommend using less, even if this is a corn starch company recipe. :) I used rice wine instead of sherry, and left out the corn syrup. The flavor was very good though!

SO GOOD!!  Followed other reviewers & 1/2ed the corn starch, 1/2ed the corn syrup, upped the red pepper by about 4x, & added 2 T oyster sauce.   Served over wok-veggies (bok choy, carrots, broccoli, celery, tomato, green pepper, & onion, stir-fried in olive oil, sherry & hot oil) & brown rice.  Will definitely be making again!

This is the best stir fry sauce I've come across on AllRecipes! I followed the recipe exactly (although omitted corn syrup b/c I simply don't keep it in my pantry), and I thought it was wonderful. It had the perfect balance of sweet and salty... definately NOT bland!

This is great, I didn't have any oil so I added 2 TBS of peanut butter.  It made it more of a Thai dish however, my whole family loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly. But was a bit bland. I had to doctor it up by adding 2T oyster sauce and 4 T plum sauce. After the additions it was good. I am still looking for a better stir fry sauce.

Nice flavor with a good zing! I really liked this sauce. I changed the servings to 4 and rounded down all of the ingredients (so slightly less cornstarch, etc. as per the reviews below). I didn't measure the cayanne pepper, just a couple shakes, and that gave a nice zip. Will definitely make again.

This sauce was fantastic! my fiance and I had it last night and agree to keep it in our "make again" collection of recipes.  If you want a sauce that tastes just like a reastaurants, make this one.

Great!  Makes a LOT of sauce.  I added lots more garlic and cayenne plus a Szechuan pepper blend, Chinese 5-spice blend, and a little fish sauce.

great sauce, very easy. It is pretty thick, and I only used half the cornstarch recommended to start with. It does make a lot of sauce, so caution when pouring it over the stirfry! A little tends to go a long way. Delicious though!

I halved this recipe, and it came out perfect (not too thick, not too salty, maybe a little too sweet, but I'm overly sensitive to salt and sugar). I used it on shrimp, broccoli, bell pepper and Thai noodles, and it tasted just as good as stuff you'd buy at the store!

This turned out good in the end but only after several alterations to the original recipe.  1) Only use 1.5 tbsp of corn starch otherwise it gets way too thick.  2) Omit the brown sugar and add 2 tsp of white sugar.  3) I used white wine instead of dry sherry.  4) I used vegetable oil instead of sesame oil.  5) I added sesame seeds to the sauce.  6) I added minced serrano peppers to the sauce.  7) I used white vinegar instead of rice vinegar.  8) I used 1/4 cup corn syrup.  9) I had to use about a 1/2 water to cut the strong taste of the sauce.  Once it was mixed into the rice and chicken and veggies it was delicious but on it's own it was a little strong.

I certainly loved the sauce, however not one of my 3 (non-picky eaters) would eat more than a bite. I would not recommend this for those who are making it for toddlers to grade school age children. Tasted amazing to me and my husbnd though.

Delicious! The combination of flavors made for a complex stir fry sauce, I will definitely make again. Following the advice of fellow reviewers, I made a few changes. I omitted the corn syrup and instead used ponzu/sherry/chicken broth to make up the extra liquid. With three tablespoons brown sugar, I still found it very sweet but not cloying (next time I'll use two tablespoons). I used a quarter teaspoon crushed red pepper AND cayenne and it was barely spicy. Finally, I doubled the ginger and tripled the garlic.

Very good sauce.  I didn't have the dry sherry, but it still turned out very good.  I would recommend this sauce to anyone who wants a basic, easy stir fry sauce.  I cooked my meat, then added the sauce and steamed veggies.  Put it over rice.  Not too salty for a stir fry sauce.

This went over well with my family. I used it with a varied assortment of leftover uncooked veggies in my fridge in a stir fry. It is a bit thick, but I liked it that way. I'm thinking it might make a good dip for egg rolls or something like that.

I followed this recipe as written minus the dry sherry, on account that I did not have any on hand.  My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED it. I disagree with the common review of "too thick", it was perfect for me. This was just what I was looking for to spice up a quick meal of brown rice and veggies. I served this with a miso soup that I make and will be posting the recipe soon! Thanks for the great sauce!

This is the BEST stir fry sauce I've ever tasted--have tried many different recipes in my years of cooking and this beats them all. Very thick so it clung to my vegetables nicely. Next time I will add more red pepper flakes to suit my personal taste, but this is perfect as written too.

A good plain stir fry sauce.  I too used a little less corn syrup and it was good.  Instead of cooking it ahead of time, you can just add it to your wok at the end of stir frying your other items and it will thicken up in about a minute.

More like 4.5 stars really.  One of my favorite recipes from this site is "Asian Noodles with Chicken" but the stir fry sauce can be expensive, so I thought I'd give this a try since most of the ingredients are staples at my house.  I did reduce the corn syrup to 1/4 cup and probably only used 1.5 T of corn starch because I didn't want it to be too thick for the recipe I was using it in.  This worked really well and in fact I couldn't tell the difference between the bottled brand I normally buy and what I made.  Thanks so much - I will be making this often.

This recipe definitely needs less cornstarch --- I'd go with a single tablespoon as opposed to two --- But otherwise, it's ridiculously delicious, with a  very rich, bold, full flavour. Highly recommended!

I appreciate this as a nice base recipe.  It can easily be adapted to meet someone's flavor preferences. I like that it thickens up nicely.  I use Costco's frozen stirfry veggies, and they tend to be a little watery, so this is a perfect balance.  Thank you!

This was good with a number of changes.  Reduced corn starch and soy sauce in half.  Also used 1/4 cup honey in place of corn syrup.  It turned a little salty but good, next time will reduce the soy sauce a little more...

Very easy to make .. I ( like most others ) used less corn syrup and I didn't have fresh ginger so i used some ground ginger that I had already in the pantry .. I also should mention that I left out the " Spice Islands " with it being so little I didn't see the need to buy any or make so I left it out and never noticed a difference

I have made this too many times to remember. I never have cornstarch or corn syrup in the house, so I just omit them and it always comes out as a great stir fry sauce anyways. I use it for vegetable and quinoa stirfries almost weekly.

I agree with the other reviews...too much corn starch.  I even cut it down and it was still a little too thick.  I added a bit of water to combate this problem.  Picky husband loved this, will make again!
I did not add sherry b/c I didnt have on hand, and did not add corn syrup.  I think the brown sugar was plenty.

SOOO good!  I followed directions exactly (grated ginger) and it always tastes good.  If making with stir fry I suggest only drizzling sauce over vegetables and meat because it can overpower if too much is used.

This sauce really perked up our normally bland tempeh stir fry. I agree with one of the other reviews who said this was a little too thick so next time I'll likely cut back on the cornstarch. We made the following substitutions if anyone is interested: madeira for dry sherry, brown rice vinegar for rice vinegar, a few healthy shakes of powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger. Thanks!

Very yummy and so easy.  I left out the corn syrup simply because I was out of it.  In it's place I used a couple Tbls. white sugar.  It is very thick just like bottled stir fry sauce.  Only this is made fresh and I know exactly what the ingredients are.  Very forgiving and easy to tweak.  I'll use this again and again.

I can't say enough about this stir-fry sauce. It is the best one I have found to date. I make a batch to keep on hand in the fridge for stir frying chicken and broccoli florets with bell pepper and onion. Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great sauce needs a little more flavor so I just mixed and matched the ingredients with some of my favorite spices/flavors. Still following this recipe but for example used apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar.

I went out and bought all the ingredients called for in this recipe because I wanted to follow the instructions to the T!  I'm glad I did because it was the BEST stir fry sauce I have ever tried!  Others mentioned that the sauce was too thick, but I did not think so.  It coated the veggies and chicken I used perfectly.  The only thing I changed was that I added a few extra shakes of crushed red pepper and it was great!  Not too spicy and just enough kick!  Will definitely make this again and again!

Used the recipe as a guide, but made alot of substitutions. Garlic Powder instead of fresh; Ground Red Pepper instead of crushed, more rice wine vinegar instead of sherry, missed the oil completely, no ginger. Probably ended up with more cornstarch in mine than it called for.  I doubled my batch. When it was done, it was a touch too spicy (I was bit heavy handed with the Red Pepper), so I added another 1/2 cup of corn syrup and about 3/4 cup of water and brought it back up to a boil. Used it sparingly on the stir fry and it was warmly spicy and quite tasty!

This is a good "all purpose" Asian sauce.

I used low sodium soy sauce. Better than bottled stir fry sauce! My kids even liked it!

Really yummy, no need for jarred sauce when you have this simple recipe!  I substituted white wine for the sherry.

This sauce was really good.  My kids loved it!  I cut the corn starch back by 1/2 T and used agave nectar instead of corn syrup.  Wish I would have doubled recipe!

Didn't use corn syrup as I knew it would come out to thick, and I didn't have sherry so I did without. I also use white vinegar because that's what I had in the cabinet. Be careful and don't use to much sesame oil because it is very strong. I used minced ginger however ground ginger would work perfectly. I mixed all ingredients in a bowl then added to a pot. Sauce is delicious and I've used it everyday this week.

VERY GOOD! I took out the Karo corn syrup because I didn't have any. In its place, I put in a tablespoon of sugar. Mixed in the sauce after I sauteed peppers, broccoli, green onions, red onion, cabbage, jalapeno, carrots and pineapple. yum yum yum

I’ll definitely use this again! Made exactly as written. I liked the thick consistency; it clung nicely to my veggies, tofu and rice. Who likes watery stir fry sauce?  Also I  disagree with reviews saying too salty, although I do buy low sodium soy sauce. Thanks!!!

This sauce is AWESOME!!!! I wanted to make a healthier version so I did what many people did and didn't use corn syrup (I used honey instead). Also I used low sodium soy sauce and added just a bit of chili oil. It was great on our stir fry! I will definitely be making this sauce again and again.

We made this tonight because we were all out of stir fry sauce and needed a quick recipe.  This was wonderful.  I tripled the recipe because we were making enough food for seven people and I would have been fine doubling it.  I made it almost exactly as written, except I added extra garlic and once it was nice and bubbly I thought it needed more sugar and ginger.  Everyone kept raving about how good it was, this is definitely a keeper!

Most of the ratings are high for this stir-fry sauce despite so many of the reviewers mentioning cutting the corn starch (too thick), leaving out the corn syrup (too sweet) and cutting the soy sauce (too salty). 

Well, I've made the sauce twice now following the recipe, and each time it thickened up to the consistency of a terribly sweet and salty gelatinous mass that I couldn't even pour without stirring in extra water.

Even so, I have a hunch that eliminating the corn syrup, cutting the corn starch by half and cutting back on the soy sauce (or using a low-sodium variety) just might make it pretty good. As is, though, nope, neither I nor my wife liked it.

This is exactly what I've been looking for! Strong taste, thick consistency, well balanced. I didn't have cooking sherry so I used cooking wine and I also took advice from others to lessen the corn starch and soy sauce (I did 3/8ths cup of each) and upped the garlic and ginger (1.5 times). It was delicious!

great sauce however in trying to cut just a few calories I used coconut milk in place of the karo syrup with a little agave nectar, added some cashews for crunch and it was wonderful
