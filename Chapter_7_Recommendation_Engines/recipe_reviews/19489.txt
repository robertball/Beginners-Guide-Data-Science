I'm from Maryland also.  The recipe sounds OK except PLEASE don't shred the crab meat.  It should stay in lumps and be handled gently.  It's traditional to use Maryland's own Old Bay seasoning, not hot sauce.  Also, when formed the cakes should be refrigerated for about half an hour, to firm up a little and prevent their breaking up in the pan.

I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, so if anyone knows a good crabcake, it's me.  And this recipe will make you one FINE crabcake!  I didn't have dry mustard on hand, but I substituted a bit of spicy brown, and it worked just fine.  A tip - do NOT overmix the crab meat - it will not turn out the way it's supposed to if you do - it's supposed to be lumpy!  (People who weren't raised in MD tend not to know this, I've found.)  If you can find Old Bay in your supermarket, BUY IT - it makes the difference!  And of course, good Maryland crabmeat, if you can!  Thanks, Bea, this rivals my own recipe!  :-)

I am from Maryland and we DO love our crabcakes!! It is important to use fresh, not canned crabmeat, lump is the best. I know this makes it more expensive but it is the difference between great and boring Mrs. Paul's. Also, I like to add some Old Bay seasoning to spice it up. Be gentle when mixing together the ingredients so you don't break up the sweet lumps of crabmeat, you don't want it to be fine like catfood!! I also like to saute my crabcakes in butter in a skillet rather than broil them, but either way this is a delicious and authentic recipe. Yummy.

I found this recipe Not so great.  First use only fresh lump blue crab, not canned.  And do NOT shred it. Gently check for cartlidge.  Add an egg to help bind the ingredients. And how can you post a recipe pretending to be a Maryland crab cake without Old Bay seasoning.  (That is unforgivable.)add 1Tablespoon (give or take depending upon your tast). A dash of Worchestershire sauce is also an optional addition. Gently fold all ingredients to gether and then form them into 4 cakes and regdgerate for 30+ minutes before attemping to fry.

I am from Maryland, so we eat alot of crabcakes. I have tried many crabcake recipes, and this one is probably the best. I followed the recipe exactly, but I wanted to add Old Bay Seasoning, which I forgot *gasp*.

Don't over mix the crab meat. It should stay lumpy!

I'm giving this 5 stars only because I heeded the advice of many other reviewers and made some changes.  They came out so good and I will definitely make them again and again.  I did not shred the crab meat; I left it well-lumped.  I used 3 tablespoons of plain bread crumbs.  I did not use salt, pepper, or hot sauce.  Instead I used 1 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning.  I used two tablespoons of mayonnaise.  I baked them on the center rack for 12 minutes.  They didn't need to go to the top rack at the end for a few extra minutes.  They came out perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and hot and full of flavor on the inside.  I served them with a fresh-made remoulade sauce that I got at my local farmer's market.

These are great, with some adjustments as others have suggested; it is a must to add Old Bay, and I formed them and then chilled them so they didn't fall apart. My crab cake connisseur thought they were great. Served them with a Joe's Mustard Sauce (South Beach Diet) and they were a hit!

These are outstanding crabcakes! I added a bit of Dijon and minced green onions to them. Serves with Crab Cake sauce on the side.

I had a dinner party with a bunch of picky people, who all enjoyed this recipe (thankfully!) The only things I would do differently are to 1) use a cookie sheet, not a broiler pan 2) actually remember to lightly grease the cookie sheet and 3) make more. There were 8 people and I scaled the recipe for 10, but it still only came out to about 1.5 crabcakes per person.

First time I ever made crab cakes. That being said, I grew up in the DC, MD, VA area, and still live here. I tweaked the recipe a bit, and it turned out okay, however, I have a couple of more tweaks for it to make it even better. What I did today. No salt, added Cayenne pepper, just  a couple of shakes, added Worchestershire Sauce, ignore the hot sauce, use Old Bay instead. Instead of dry mustard, I used prepared Dijon coarse mustard.  To form the cakes, use a 1/4 cup measuring cup.  It makes the perfect size crab cake...Next time, I will add some lemon zest and a little more cayenne pepper.

Here in the UK crab is expensive. So i added some white fish to bulk it out. It worked very well. The cakes were light and excellent.

I know this might not be "Maryland like", but so far I've actually preferred this recipe without the Old Bay seasoning because most of the crab cakes I've tried have had too much Old Bay. I did leave out the salt, and added some onion and celery. Broiling (as opposed to frying) also helped keep the calorie count down, and I used olive oil cooking spray and egg substitute to bring it down even further. I also top each one with a sprinkling of panko breadcrumbs, which gives them a little crunch. I loved these, thanks for the great recipe! I'll definitely be making these again!

This crab cake was insanely delish!!  The only differences I made were cooking them in a cast iron pan on the grill.  I put a couple small pats of butter on the pan and a couple small pats on top of each cake.  I also sprinkled Old Bay seasoning in the mixture as well as sprinkling it on top while it cooked (used this instead of hot sauce).  This is the first time I made crab cakes too...I always thought it was too difficult.  These are easy and good.  This will be my "go to" crab cake recipe from now on.

EDIT: I've made this many times now and followed someones tip to use a 1/3 measuring cup to mold the cakes and it is truly genius.  They are the perfect size!  Also, I get the 16 oz container of Phillips crab meat from Costco.  It is the cheapest and best crab meat you can buy!  Also, I mix all ingredients and gently fold the crab meat in last and I never shred it - I like big chunks of crab, not shredded crab.

I never made crab cakes before. This recipe is very easy and even my picky husband loved it! But I think next time I am going to fry them instead of broil them. They truned out just a little bit on a dry side by broiling them. I will deffinitely make them again for my family.

Vancouver island is also famous for crabs!! :) These turned out awesome, I didn't have bread crumbs, so I bashed up some crackers instead. I used cilantro and coriander seeds for a bit of flavour as I don't like mustard. The only thing that I would have changed, is greasing the pan a bit more, mine stuck. Great recipe, will make again.

I finally can make the type of crab cakes I love so much.  Having been spoiled with Maryland style crab cakes when I lived in PA, I have ordered these several times in NY and NJ and rarely have crab cakes in this style.  As from other reviewers, I made some changes.  I used 1 lb of fresh crab meat which would result in about 5 dinner size cakes.  I used Old Bay instead of Hot Sauce.  I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I let sit in fridge for about 30-45 minutes to firm.  I put it on rack 2nd from top in broiler.  They came out fabulous.  I believe I put 2 T of Mayo and at some point might try with homemade mayo as I have been told that it would make a great difference. I served with a Rémoulade sauce bought in seafood department.

Being from Baltimore, I don't know how anyone can call these Maryland crab cakes without adding Old Bay seafood seasoning. The recipe is actually very good, but not by Maryland's standards.

These were delicious I followed the recipe but refrigerated the cakes before cooking them and didn't shred the crab. I used canned crab because we didn't have any fresh crab at the store. Still was amazing!

I made these with fresh crab meat and they were delicious. The crabs I got were so nice and the meat was all in big chunks which is the best. I'm not a big fan of mustard so I left it out and they still turned out really good and very flavorful. It's best to mix everything together with your hands, it's kind of gross but that way you don't break the meat all apart.

These were just wonderful.   I had extra large eggs so I added a little bit more bread crumbs to offset the added moisture from the bigger egg, also dredged the patties in bread crumbs and sprayed with PAM before broiling about 5 minutes on each side with the rack in the middle of the oven. I'll add that fresh chopped parsley really makes this a wonderful crab cake. We very much liked these, especially Hubs who can be picky.

Great crab cakes.  I (like others) replaced the hot sauce w/Old Bay cause I can't imagine any type of seafood w/o at least a little Old Bay on it ;).  I also cut the calories by cutting out the egg yolk and using lo-cal mayo.  Broiling with a little shot of Pam was a super idea.  They had a nice crunchy outer crust and were cooked perfectly on the inside.  Thanks for the post!

This was great!

Because we wanted to grill them, I almost doubled the egg & mayo so they wouldn't be dry.  Other than that, the only change I made was to add a little diced red pepper for color.

I too went with larger chunks of crab in the cake (preference): the filler amount for this recipe assumes shredded crab, so my chunky mix needed some time in the fridge to firm up and not crumble. In the future I might shred ~1/3 of the crab and leave the rest in chunks, just to make a nice cohesive cake. I also have an irrational fear of broiling so I just baked at 450 for about 15 minutes: I found this to dry the cakes out. I know broiling would make a nice crispy top with moist insides; I'll just suck it up and make as directed in the future. As with any recipe I seasoned these to our liking, using the written instructions as a guide. This includes Old Bay, but I agree with a previous review that it's not a requirement for a perfect crab cake. This is now my crab cake recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

Had these crab cakes at a party and couldn't stop raving about them (or eating them!)...the host shared the recipe with me and I made them for Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved them!  They are very easy to make.  I also added chopped celery & onions - Yumm!

I LOVE this recipe. I am originally from MD, but I'm also military so I have to take the MD with me :) I take this to pot lucks and the such ALL the time and they are ALWAYS gone. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the recipe calls for "hot pepper sauce" and every native Maryland knows that it SHOULD say Old Bay Seasoning. The crab cakes should be large and fluffy, not smashed cakes, and they should be broiled. Anyhow, with those changes, the taste is authentic and delicious and I use this recipe EVERY time.

This was a very good crab cake...not much filler and mostly crab...just how we like it!!  I followed the tips of others and used old bay and omitted the hot sauce.  My husband who is from Maryland kept saying, "MMMM....no more Red Lobster"!!!  Delicious!  Thanks!

Great use of fresh Dungeness crab from Puget Sound!  Followed the recipe fairly close, but did not bother with measurements - everything by eye.  I did thrown in some Panko crumbs with the bread crumbs and added the requisite Old Bay.  Sprinkled the tops with extra Panko and sprayed with Pam.    DON'T broil for 10-15 minutes as recipe calls for, or at least not on the top rack.  Mine was starting to over brown on top in 3 minutes.  Followed another reviewer's suggestion and set the oven to broil, but used the middle-low rack for all but the last 2-3 minutes.  Served with a variation of a Remoulade sauce from this site.

These crab cakes are as good as the ones I paid $30 per entree for in Atlanta.  Super easy to make and low calorie, low fat to boot.  It's our special meal.

Maryland crab cakes are made with lump or jumbo lump crabmeat.  You should never ever shred it!   You mix it very gently with your hands so you don't break up the lumps.  Also, most Maryland crab cake recipes use Old Bay Seasoning.

This is very good recipe.  I loved broiling over pan frying and the fact that it does not have Old Bay.  My favorite crab cakes include scallions and lemon but these were great.

This recipe was simple to follow and the results were fantastic.  I made six servings using 2 lbs of lump crabmeat.  The key is to broil it just long enough to crisp it, but not to burn.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These were great, but I modified them a bit.  I added chives, Old Bay seasoning, twice the bread crumbs, and sauteed them in butter which made them a nice golden brown.  Served with a tangy horseradish sauce for dipping.  Definitely will make this again!

I am a Marylander, too.  This is a good recipe, but a tad bland.  I believe that it might be a 5-star if if were to include OLD BAY seasoning, which is absolutely essential for a delicious crabcake.

I have lived in Maryland all my life, and these, I'm sorry to say, were not good crab cakes. They were dry and had a poor taste besides. We will not be having these again. What a terrible waste of a pound of backfin crab meat!

This recipe did not work AT ALL with imitation crab meat!  I ended up throwing the entire mixture in the trash.  Hope to help someone else avoid the same mistake as a few reviewers said imitation was OK.  Wrong.  Don't even try it without fresh (or canned).

I've eaten a lot of different crab cake recipes and they were all missing in something.  Even the ones on QVC just didn't cut it for me.  THIS recipe, however is the berries (with the Old Bay added).  Without  the Old Bay, I really don't think this recipe would cut it either, but many reviews insist on the Old Bay and I agree.  Will definitely make this one again.  I did add the splash of hot sauce and think this may be what put it over the top.

Just moved to Maryland and I can't eat the crab cakes anywhere because no one makes them gluten free. I modified this recipe by smashing up Van's Natural Foods crispy whole grain baked crackers and using the crumbs rather than regular bread crumbs. Also added a little bit of Old Bay seasoning to the mix. The crab cakes were delicious and I served them with a simple sauce of light sour cream, lime juice, dill and salt. My boyfriend, who has been sampling plenty of Maryland crab cakes, said they were better than any he's had yet.

Substituted hot sauce with old bay seasoning and sprinkled a little more old bay on the top of each one before baking.  Excellent recipe!  I will be sure to use this one on a regular basis!

Awesome recipe, my boyfriend asks me to make these all the time, but I agree with some other reviewers when they say leave the crab meat in lumps, it is much better.  Also had to leave them in the fridge to firm...they looked like they would have fallen apart otherwise.  I also added some lemon juice.  Good recipe overall!

This recipe created delicious crab cakes! The end product was juicy, flavorful, and not overpowering nor too mild. Texture was great. I had made two minor substitutions and the result was uncompromised. I had used prepared yellow mustard in place of dry (just use 3X the amt) and dried parsley as opposed to fresh (use 1/3 the amt). Although the original ingredients will probably yield the best crab cakes I was very pleased with the alterations. Two mistakes that I would look out for in the future is to make sure not to use a dark baking sheet (makes the bottoms of cakes brown too quickly) and rotate the pan 180 degrees so the cakes will cook more evenly. Lastly I took other reviewers' suggestion of using 1/4 tsp old bay seasoning in place of the hot sauce. This one's a keeper.

Simply the best.  I am from NorCal where we have lots of local crab, but like the folks in Maryland, I too add Old Bay Sesoning.  I serve with a local sweet-mustard sauce and roasted green beans on the side.

These were very bland and I was very glad that I fried a little 'taster patty’ before I formed them all and broiled them.  My additions, such as green onion, minced garlic, Blackening seasoning, etc., probably kept this from being a true Maryland crab cake but if so, I am not so keen on authentic Maryland crab cakes.

This recipe didn't do it for me.  The flavor was fine, and I left it lumpy as was recommended, but the cakes (patties) did not hold together and was like plopping chunky cooky dough onto the baking sheet, then working to make each plop hold together to resemble a crab cake.  I think it was too lumpy, but even mixing it better did not deliver better results.  A lot of work and costly for it not to turn out appealing.

These are very good and very easy to make.  Like others I used Old Bay instead of hot sauce.  Just enough wet ingredients to hold together but not too much to overpower the taste of the crab.  Will definitely be making again.

I made this tonight and they turned out GREAT!!!  They tasted like they came straight from the restaurant.  I took the advice of others and add Old Bay but no salt or pepper.  I used dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh parsley.  I'm sure the fresh parsley would have made them even better.  I love the fact that they are baked instead of fried, so much healthier.  We made sandwiches out of them, like we have eaten them at some restaurants.  I can't say enough, these were GREAT (again)!!!

I used this recipe to make crab cakes for the first time ever and they got rave reviews!  This had the least amount of bread crumbs and other fillers, and I loved the fact they were broiled and not fried.  Thank you for something so simple, yet so very good!

i rated these 4 stars because i know i made the mistakes in this one. and i know you guys are going to call me a stupid head. i did not have fresh crab meat. i used canned(because it's what i had). i added old bay seasonings along with the salt and it was way to salty. so omit the salt if using old bay seasonings. other than that, i know if i would have used fresh lump crab meat it would have been great. but it tasted like a salty old salmon patty. had to make a cucumber raita sauce to cool down the salt.

I had never made crab cakes before, so I was looking for something simple.  This is it!  Baked on parchment paper.  Crispy on the outside, stayed together well, and moist and lumpy on inside...YUM!  I served mine with homemade Remoulade sauce.

Easy because you BROIL and don't fry - much healthier too :D.  Be sure to use the very best crab money can buy (not the cheap stuff next to the cans of tuna).  And I like that there's not a lot of filler (breadcrumbs/crackers).  I doubled this recipe, made mini ones for appetizers and they were eaten up immediately! Oh, and I had broiler at 450, middle rack and they took about 10 minutes.

As many reviewers have pointed out, this recipe is missing critical ingredients to be called Maryland crab cakes. I will not bother repeating all the same issues.  But would point out that  I had never heard of broiling  crabcakes.  So for the sake of time and ease of clean up, I thought I would try it that’s Wayne at her th and pan fry in butter.  As I thought, it was definitely not a good choice.  The heat and dryness of broiling is not conducive to the delicate and tender crab meat.  If u need to make significant changes to a recipe, why so many are giving  this recipe 4 or 5 stars is beyond me.

I made them twice, the second time i used 8 oz of lump and 8 oz of claw meat.  The claw meat adds alot of flavor  and they were a little more moist.  VERY GOOD either way!

Maryland crab cakes are made with McCormick's Old Bay Seafood Seasoning.  These do not come close to the way we fix crab cakes.  However, that said, they are not the worst my family has eaten with the claim of "Maryland Crab Cakes" but far from the best.

Not a very good Maryland Crab Cake recipe. There is no Old Bay seasoning, which is a must, and who in Maryland shreds crabmeat for crab cakes?  Nobody!  Always try to have as  many lumps as possible in the cake.

I, too, am a Marylander, and am happy to report I have no complaints about this recipe...like most of the other reviewers, though, a few dashes of Old Bay really will bring the ingredients together, and yes it is a felony in Maryland to shred crab meat! Traditional crab cakes call for mustard powder, which gives a nice zing without being overpowering, but if you have to use wet mustard, use just a bit...crab meat is so delicate you don't want to mask the sweetness of the meat...happy eating all...great job, Mrs. Bea!!

I thought this was pretty bland. I made it exactly how the recipe states, but I would prefer more pepper, spice or something. I paired it with a homemade hollandaise sauce and that helped!

These were wonderful. I substituted the hot pepper sauce for Old Bay, as others recommended. I also did not shred the crab meat and was careful not to overmix the mixture, as others warned against. They were delicious...thank you Bea!!!!!

Oh my are these delightful! It's my first time making crab cakes and they were easier than I thought they would be. I also liked that I can cook it in my oven instead of a skillet. I followed the recipe as it was except for the ground mustard, didn't have any so I used regular yellow mustard, still good though. Also, my patties didn't turn out as nice as the pictures on here, but they still stuck together and tasted delicious. I made the Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise sauce also from this site to go along with it.

This was the first crab cake I have made or eaten. The four stars come from the fact that I just don't enjoy crab that much. I must be crazy. The recipe was simple. I used fresh crab and tried broiling as well as on the stove. The broiling method worked better for me. The cakes stayed together, were crunchy on the top and juicy in the middle. I will make this again. Thanks.

I made these and they were a total hit!  I did use Panko crumbs and omitted the hot sauce.  I mixed them up, made them into bite sized crab cakes and put them in fridge.  I baked them in the oven on broil for about 5 min each side put some tartar sauce on the side and had a great appetizer for a party I had!

I used imitation crab and basil instead of parsley. Boyfriend loved it, I felt it was missing something, possibly salt and more mustard (we used mustard, not mustard powder). Chilled as recommended, and kept the crab in chunks. Will try again, but with only 4 minutes in the broiler (5 minutes burned them).

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I made these last night - but I didnt have real lump crab.  I had to use the imitation crab, because I just couldnt wait to try this. I know that for purists that might be a mortal sin, but it turned out FANTASTIC.  My guy said "it's the best thing I have ever eaten in my life" Now I have to go out and get the real lump crab - which will probably curl his hair :) and get me flowers :) Thanks!

We loved this recipe - I followed the suggestions of others using 2T mayo, 1tsp Old Bay and corn flake crumbs - broiled on 2nd shelf for 10 minutes then moved to top shelf for 3 minutes.  Used egg substitute to lower the fat.

This is how Maryland crab cakes are supposed to taste!  I am also from Maryland, and as other users have said, DONT shred the crabmeat!  With our left over steamed crabs I made these crabcakes and they were delicious.  I used Old Bay (not hot sauce) and added a bit of crushed red pepper flake.  Yum Yum Yum

These were super easy to make, but they really need (all together now!) Old Bay Seasoning. They also need finely chopped onions and celery. And please don't shred the crabmeat! Also, I don't think I would use canned crab, and I know that I wouldn't use fake crab. We used Dungeoness from the Puget Sound... fresh caught today!

Grew up on the Chesapeake and lived in Maryland for 38 yrs. This is a very tasty recipe. I only changed two things because of a lack of ingredients when I made them and they came out wonderfully. I substituted basil for the parsley and used a bit of Old Bay instead of hot pepper sauce.

This recipe made the first crab cake I have ever had, and it was delicous! I used fresh crab meat and mixed it into the other ingredients GENTLY to keep the cakes lumpy. I panfried them in butter and served them on split warm rolls for sandwiches. Wonderful!

This was very good with fresh caught blue crabs Old Bay mixed with Cheddar Gold Fish crackers and corn flakes ground up; then used a bit of mustard- and split mayo/cream cheese topped it w/Cajun Spice. Broiled for about 10 minutes. Can't wait to check the traps in the morning. Enjoy!!

This recipe was very helpful as this was my first time making crabcakes.  It was easy to follow.  I added some more bread crumbs because the mixture seemed to be a little too moist. They were wonderful. I think I'd prefer to have them pan fried, but this is an excellent choice for a more healthy option.

i thought this recipe was great.  like most recipes, i modified it.  i used 1 can of crab meat 4oz, and 12 oz of imitation crab.  i also took the suggestions of others and added a tsp of old bay seasoning.  finely chopped green onions are a great addition.  i've already made them times in the past wk.  rave reviews!

***i've found that non-stick aluminum foil works great on the bottom of the broiler pan***

This was really good, but make sure to turn them over half-way through broiling.  I didn't the first time and they didn't quite seem fully cooked.

Outstanding, simple recipe for crabcakes. I love the taste of crabmeat and I don't like to adulterate it too much.  This is the perfect recipe if you feel the same way.  I used regular mustard and Italian breadcrumbs since it's all I had and it turned out terrific.  My husband asked me to save the recipe.

I made this and everyone loved them, I did change the recipe by using old-bay instead of hot sauce  and only lightly shredded the crab meat but that is due the large crab meat that I found.

This is not a Maryland crab cake.  You must add Old Bay Seasoning to get a Maryland Style.  If you are from Baltimore you know what I am saying. Also you only use LUMP crab meat, you do not shred.  Your crab cake must be full of the LUMP. You have not lived till you have some.

This recipe is easy and delicious!!! Before broiling I top with some Old Bay and refrigerate the cakes for about 30 minutes so they keep their shape. As others have already stated, don't shred the crab!!! Keep it lumpy.

I used Phillips refrigerated lump, lite mayo, reduced sodium Old Bay and some breadcrumbs. That's it. 8oz crab made 4 cakes using a 1/3 cup "mold". I baked it at 400 degrees on a greased baking sheet.

When using the broiler, distance from the heat source and size of the patties matter. This recipe doesn't provide such information. The top of my crab cakes are burnt.

Excellent recipe that easily lends itself to many modifications.  I had to substitute dijon mustard for dry and added 4 dashes of cayenne with the hot pepper sauce.  Why fry these when broiling is so easy?  I lightly coated my baking sheet with sesame oil and brushed the tops with the oil also to insure even browning.  Shred or leave lumps, scallions or none; it's all good.

I know most rated this higher but most also added to the recipe and I like to rate per the stated recipe. I will say that I didn't shred the crabmeat though.  I have to agree with those that added Old Bay and other seasonings to give more flavor.  This one was just too bland for me.  If I would have added seasoning then I would have had higher scores, but then I'm rating my recipe not this one.  If you're looking for a great one, check out "My Crab Cakes" on this site...I have also made this one and it is amazing.

Marylander here.... I saw shredded crab meat and cringed!! Please do not shred crab meat, people pay a lot of money for lump crab meat (as they should).  One more thing, please don't flatten them, they should look like baseballs. Overall it's a good recipe, I add Worcestershire sauce and of course Old Bay or J.O. Spice.

Easy. Absolutely delicious! I used a very heavy dash old Old Bay for seasoning and we all loved them!  I agree with other reviewers to NOT shred but leave it lumped!  Part of the joy of eating a proper Maryland crabcake is getting the big lump to bite in to! These cooked up perfectly fine for me without refrigerating first ( as some reviewers have suggested. Certainly wouldn't be a bad idea, but I didn't have time and it didn't matter. They stayed bound together fine using an extra large egg.).

I didn't think these crab cakes were very good. I made them following the recipe as stated. They may have been better if I had modified the recipes as other reviewers did, but I would be hesitant to try it again.

Oh Lordy,....No, no, no!  I'm from Maryland's eastern shore, and we know crab cakes. Never, ever shred crab meat. The lumpier the better- always handle crab meat gently, folding ingredients into the crab meat, never aggressively mixing it. This recipe is missing Old Bay seasoning, Worcestershire sauce and butter.  Plus my dear departed momma would never have incorporated mayonnaise into the recipe.

These were so good - followed the directions but added about a Tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning.  Followed a red cocktail sauce from this site to go with these and I thought it was not good - I will go back to a good tartar sauce for these next time.

This recipe made a really good crab cake.  The only thing I did different is added slightly less than 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning.

I always mix all ingredients together first and last thing i do is add the crabmeat. Only mix to incorporate briefly and  form patties.  Fry in real butter (it's worth what it costs you in calories, I promise).  Sometimes I add very finely minced celery or red bell pepper.  Do not add more than 2 Tbs breading.  Saltines, Ritz, bread crumbs they all work!

Good recipe but should use jumbo lump crab meat drain pick out any shells and do NOT shred it. Maryland does not shred its crabmeat in its crabcakes.

I'm a Maryland girl, too.  This is similar to my recipe, except that I use cayenne or Old Bay and more parsley.  Also, instead of breadcrumbs, I use Keebler club crackers.  Like the others who wrote, you do not want to shred the crab; it needs to be lumpy.  Treat it very gently.

Never shred crabmeat. Use crushed saltines, not breadcrumbs. Refrigerate before shaping into patties. Old Bay is optional imo. Andrew Zimmern has the best recipe, hands down.

As a native of Maryland, born & raised on the Chesapeake Bay, I can say this recipe sounds like a nice variation of a crab cake, but shouldn't be labeled a "Maryland" crab cake. The crabmeat should not be shredded and jumbo lump blue crab meat should be used, as well as, Old Bay Seasoning. Otherwise, it's just a crab cake.

These turned out very good! I did listen to others who said to add old bay... Which I was planning to do BC I always do. I left out the salt and added garlic powder, onion powder and a squeeze of lemon (about 1/4 tsp of each addl' ingredient.) I also added a dash of cayenne pepper but I cook with it all the time. My family truly loved these! Will make again as crab balls for our holiday party.

My first time making crab cakes and these were so yummy.  I changed the recipe just a little based on the reviews. I used 3 tablespoons bread crumbs (Italian seasoned) and lightly fried them instead of baked.  Soo delish! Thanks

These were good.  I added more bread crumbs, old bay and green onion.  I think I would have liked them better if sauteed in butter, but this was a little healthier.

The fact that these are broiled makes them perfect.  I added a little bit of Old Bay.

These crab cakes had too much crab and not enough seasoning or bread crumbs and think they would have been better fried. I don't think I will try these again.

These were really good. I served at a small dinner for guests and they all loved them. I served with crab cake sauce from this site and it was delish! I was making bacon wrapped asparagus and just baked them while that was in the oven too and they turned out great!

I tried these out on my family and one person really loved them, but I felt they were lacking. I believe I will be adding some butter, old bay seasoning, and maybe some shrimp to these the next time I make them. They were a little dry, so I will probably fry them in a buttered pan as well.

I made this recipe for my very first time making crab cakes.  I used 1 lb lump crab from our local seafood market.  These turned out amazing.  I did add the old bay seasoning (about 1 teaspoon) and seared them in a big electric skillet and it ended up making 8 medium ones.  I would recommend this 100%, just make sure your crab and parsley are fresh...it does make a difference.

I couldn't find fresh crab meat, so I used a nice piece of fresh salmon. I steamed the salmon, and flaked it into small pieces. I didn't have dried breadcrumbs in the pantry so I used oatmeal. I used dried dill in place of the parsley, the only other substitution I made was to use Miracle Whip in place of the mayo. They were tasty, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.

I thought this was a great recipe but I did make some changes.  I used yellow mustard and used 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs.  I also added Old Bay seasoning.  I followed the advice of others and refrigerated the mixture for an hour or so to firm it up.  I cooked it in a pan with butter and oil.  Overall I thought it was a good recipe I gave it 4 stars because I made alot of changes.

Good and simple!! I had nothing but crab meat in the house and went searching for anything really. I came across this bec I had everything. It turned out pretty good. Only thing is I had to use alot more breadcrumbs or there would be no way it would have stayed together. I'd make again but probally would add more seasoning and erbs.

I combined this recipe with another recipe that called for the same ingredients except I added panko bread crumbs to my italian bread crumbs, a dash of Worchestire sauce, a teaspoon of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.  After I prepared the crab cakes, I put them in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes to let them firm up and cooked them in olive oil.  My family loved it.  They thought my crab cakes tasted better than restaurants.

Great recipe! I have never made Crab Cakes from scratch I usually order them at fancy restaurants on special occasions. These were very easy to make, and were a HUGE hit with everyone! If you are a fan of the traditional Maryland Crabcake this recipe is great! I agree with other posts don't shred the crab its supposed to be lumpy. :)

Pretty good!  DH really like these crab cakes- I used Old Bay instead of hot sauce- then mixed some hot sauce in the tartar sauce when I served them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm sorry, I didn't like this at all. It was way too salty for my taste, and I didn't add any salt. It may be because I used canned crab but I did rinse it before using it.
I've never had crabcakes before so I didn't know what to expect. However crab is my most favorite food in the world, so if I can try it again with some help from other cooks, I'm willing to have a go at it.

Fantastic even with a few minor changes- used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and forgot to add the egg (used a little extra mayo instead).  My husband and 2-yr old liked them!!  I also like that they're broiled and not fried (used non-stick foil to prevent them from sticking to the pan).  Will make again, this is a keeper.

This was my first time attempting these and they were great!!! I made just a couple of minor adjustments. I used 3 egg whites instead of a whole egg and I used a little Old Bay Seasoning. Also, careful when broiling them..I moved my rack down in the oven and they still almost burnt!!

I am keen on trying this recipe with the imitation crab as an alternative

These were actually pretty tasty. I did use imitation crab though, but overall I would make again. Just as a warning though, go easy on the cayenne otherwise they are a little too hot.

I could eat these every week.  They were a nice part of a "surf n turf" menu.  The turf was a filet Mignon, and the "surf" was the crab cakes.

Nothing better than catching and cooking your own blue claws. Made them exactly  except for adding Old bay seasoning. Not much though, You want the crab flavor to be the star. Fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!

I cannot truly rate this as it does not have Bay seasoning. I never had REAL crab cakes until I was stuck for several hours in the Baltimore airport and decided to treat  myself to a
 Phillip's  Restaurant crab cake special. As a homegrown Long Islander who had known some really good seafood, I had never had such incredible crab cakes.  I will forever compare my crab cakes to this restaurant. I make my own based on theirs due to dietary restrictions. It is a treat due to the sodium. NEVER cheat yourself of the true thing!

It was a great recipe.  Short and sweet, everyone enjoyed the crab cakes.  I added 1/4 tsp of Coleman mustard and old bay, then 1 tsp lemon.

I made some minor adjustments to the recipe which I believe enhanced it.  I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise, added a little melted butter to the panko, and increased the panko by just a bit, added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I also added a dollop of butter before baking.   At the end of the baking, I put them under the broiler for less than a minute.

I followed the advise of the Maryland Peeps and added Old Bay..I was kinda conservative with that. I should have used more.I also put them in the fridge for 1/2 hr. They were great and I definitely would make them again,

This is a great basic recipe, and has good flavor.  I added Old Bay seasoning, some shredded and carmelized onion with garlic, and a bit more mayo to help hold it all togther.  Everyone had seconds, so I would say it's a keeper.

These were good, and I got around nine 2" crab cakes. I also added 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp of lemon juice (saw this on other recipes). I preferred to pan-fry these in some olive oil and butter. The first batch I did were falling apart, but the second batch really kept their shape (due to hotter pan?). I even refrigerated the mixture for an hour prior. Other recipes call for a lot more bread crumbs (1 1/2 cups for 1 lb crab), so I would increase the bread crumbs the next time (more, but not THAT much). I enjoyed these with Remoulade Sauce with Horseradish from this site. It gives these the kick they need.

I truly love crab cakes, so, I thought I would give this a try.   I shredded part of the crab and left some in bigger lumps.  I felt like something was missing from the flavor profile.  Crab is very expensive where I live, so, I probably won't be making this recipe again.

I used old bay instead of hot sauce. 10 mins in the broiler was a bit too long; made it a tiny bit dry.  Also, if you want it a little healthier, I used avocado mayo in place of real mayo + mustard since avocado mayo already had mustard in it.

Great recipe! Sorry Chef John did not have fresh nor reasonable acces to same... Used canned lump crab. also did not have saltine  crackers but did the math and substituted 35 oyster crackers. otherwise followed the recipe. 

Having lived in Maryland I have eaten and cooked a lot of crab cakes. This recipe is  great, and yes could be better with fresh, but even with humble canned crab it was DELICIOUS!

I do recommend using the "optional "chef John's signature spice cayenne  I used an 1/8 of a teaspoon...

Loved it.  Will make it again and again.  I made it as written with exception of shredding crab meat.  I just chopped it up a little and very gently mixed everything together.  Really easy.

I followed the recipe exactly,  and it was delicious.  I do not like bready crab cakes, and these were not full of bread at all.  Loaded with crab meat with just a bit of bread crumbs to help hold it together.  My husband loved them.  Reminded us of crab cakes we experienced in a small restaurant  in Annapolis.

Do not shred the crabmeat. Backfin is expensive, but far sweeter. Do not use imported, canned crab. Use one small egg as a binder. Substitute 8 - 10 saltine crackers for bread. Use a dash or two of "Wooster". If it is a Maryland (or better yet, Baltimore) crab cake, Old Bay Seasoning is de rigueur. Broil quickly; or pan fry in lard, using a seasoned cast iron skillet. Either way - do not overcook. You want to taste the crabmeat! Serve on a bed of lettuce. If a sandwich, use a thin brioche roll

This recipe turned out to be the best ever crab cakes we have ever made. We have tried about 15 other crab cake recipes in the past.  We used Ritz crackers  for the crumbs. Additionally added  lemon juice, crushed red pepper flakes, chopped green onions. We also coated the cakes again just prior to broiling. No oil or butter other than non stick spray to keep from sticking after completed. This recipe is by far the best one where the true taste of the crab comes through. The most satisfying crab cake I ever ate. Better than Emmerils too. We used this one with Dungenous and King Crab and both ways  yielded great results.

Suspect the low rating because fresh crab was not available and used canned crabmeat. Will not make again unless with fresh crab.Also adde finely chopped red onion.

I had crab cakes once before in a restaurant and liked them but never thought I could make them at home. I did not imagine how easy these were to make and how good they tasted. The recipe was quick and easy. I had a left over and warmed the crab cake up the next day and it was good warmed up too. However next time I think I will use the over to warm up the cake and not the microwave.

This is my favourite recipe for crab cakes, and closest to the one we used after an evening of crabbing and resulting all day of "picking" crab meat on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  You don't need that seafood seasoning every recipe asks for when you boil live crabs in water you've seasoned, heavily, with it!

I changed it just a tweak or two.  I had fresh crab and I like lumps so I didn't shred it.  I did use Old Bay and added an egg.  They were so good.

I made this recipe and took into consideration leaving them lumpy. Mine looked like the picture but i found the taste somewhat bland. I agree a little old bay seasoning would probably have done the trick to jazz them up....maybe a little more hot sauce too, but taste is a preference.

There is nothing better than MD Crab Cakes!  I'm from MD so I eat a lot of Steamed Blue Crabs and I make a great crabcakes! This recipe is almost traditional it,  without the hot spice. Now that being said, we Marylander's make crabcakes anyway we want! Hot, spicey mild plain... Whatever floats your boat!  We have great seafood!!!!!!

I gave it a try, pretty much like the decent crab cakes you get around Baltimore in the little neighborhood taverns these days. Good, but IMHO, it lacks a few items and details to come up to a traditional regional crab cake.  The recipe though is pretty authentic, otherwise, to the region of central MD.
In my own version, I make a few changes that came from the owner of a tavern on the water, owned by a waterman and his wife,  in Point Pleasant near Glen Burnie, MD.  Where I enjoyed many a crab cake sandwich, (just the cake and a couple of saltine crackers) accompanied by cold Natty Boh's on draft--The real thing before Carling took over the old National Brewing Co.   at the time it was local favorite-- they brought you them O's-- although, the owner used to swear the old Gunther, even then, a long lost brand, was the best beer to drink with crabs. I can only barely recall the brand since they were bought out by Hamm's (also now defunct,) before I was of legal age.  

The couple, though were well known  known for their superb crab cakes from the late 40's through late 70's, when they sold the tavern and retired to Florida. Here is the recipe for 1 lb of back fin crab meat, (I used to use special, which is made from the entire body portion, not just the much prized lump that attaches to the rear swimmer fin- but it's difficult to find,  and doesn't make a material difference in the tavern version of MD crab cakes. The wife and I pick our own when possible to make the real thin

Wonderful. I did changes. Added leaf onion, (green onion leafs only), doubled recipe, added chili pepper spice, left out for half hour, too warm up, (blends flavors more better), topped off with homemade cranberry topinade, also left out to warm up so it coats better.  Fantabulistic. All involved, loved it. Served with white rice. Will definitely make sure it's around for a long time.

I grew up in Maryland.  We always used the best quality lump crab meat and Old Bay seasoning.  There also would be very little bread crumbs.

Very very good recipe. Most crab cakes are composed of mostly filler with bread crumbs. If I wanted a loaf of bread I'd make one. Isn't it best to taste the crab meat?!!  Kudos to the cook here. Great job.

Actually the recipe sounds great but I'd rather just walk the mere two minute walk from my back door to the private beach on which I live at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and put out my pots and catch my own fresh and live crabs to steam later. Yum! LOL!

Use ONLY blue crab lump, do not shred.  Ease coast blue crabmeat only!!  I used Old Bay seasoning instead of parsley, salt ok a very small bit or no pepper.  I like panko breadcrumbs as a personal preference, breadcrumbs are good for authenticity.  I used oil on a hot nonstick pan for a five minutes per side then into a 400 degree oven 10-15 minutes.

I'm from The Baltimore & Annapolis area & know seafood.-
The REAL Md. crab cakes are the lump crab meat, Old Bay
to taste & enough Real Kraft Mayonnaise to hold them
together.  Anything else is considered, "filler" !

Following the recipe, it was too wet to make patties.
I used twice the amount of breadcrumbs.
The recipe seemed a bit bland, so I added some finely chopped onion.
Also put into the fridge for 15 mins. to firm up.
Grilling (broiling) will only cook the top of the patties, so I fried them in butter and turned them over when browned.

How I hate recipes that you have to change to make them work !

The raw crab tasted nice. The patties tasted of nothing really.
Next time, I will have raw crab with a salad !

I just made this recipe and I  have to say that this is my new favorite way to make crab cakes. I did what others also suggested added Old Bay seasoning and refrigerated them for a half hour. Broiling them instead of sauteing them helped to keep them together in my opinion.

Great! Used a couple suggestions from other users. I used about 2 tablespoons of mayo instead of 1.5. Added some paprika and dried bay leaf to bring in a little of that Old Bay Seasoning essence. Also added a little lemon zest. Didn't shred- left as lump crab meat. Turned out yummy! Make sure not to overcook them.

This was delicious!! I took others' advice and added Old Bay - added one more egg and one T more breadcrumbs. It turned out perfectly and impressed my finicky teenager who was having a tough day.  I will definitely make it again.

My small changes were 2 tbsp breadcrumbs & 2 tbsp mayo. I also replaced the dash of hot sauce with a pinch of Cajun seasoning. I baked them on a cookie sheet @ 400 for 20 min and flipped them at 16 min. Mark.

Wonderful recipe! The only change I made was used Old Bay instead of hot sauce. I put the mixture in silicone baking cups as a mold and put in refrigerator for a couple of hours to chill. Lightly buttered a baking sheet and popped the cakes easily onto the sheet. Basically I never  handled the mixture with my hands, and when I mixed the ingredients together I gently folded them. I added a little extra Old Bay and paprika on the top of each cake before broiling for eye appeal. So easy and delicious.

This was an excellent recipe!!! We live in Maryland so we can be picky when it comes to crab cakes but I thought these were restaurant quality. I made these as written but used 1/2 teaspoon old bay instead of the hot sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Used left over whole crabs with traditional Old Bay seasoning. 
Do not add salt and do not shred (Old Bay has plenty of salt/ lump crab, enough said).
Used Kraft mayo made with olive oil and cracked pepper.  
Broill first side at 10 minutes and flip for an additional 3 to 4 minutes.

I was very disappointed.  Oh well there's always tomorrow.

It was ok, not great, but not bad. I followed exact recipe, but at the 15 minute mark for broil the crab cakes were quite browned. I felt they dried out, but my husband had no complaints. I'll tweet the recipe next time, maybe more mayo.

Very good. I made them exactly as directed and loved them. Very easy to make. I think I'll try it next time with the Old Bay since so many suggested it.

This was really good!  I didn't use hot sauce, though. Instead, I added Old Bay seasoning and worcestershire sauce, like previous reviewers did. I also added just a little black pepper and some green onion.  I did not shred the crab meat...I kept it chunky.  This was so tasty!

Pretty good, but bland, as written.  I'll definitely make this again but next time I'll add some minced onion and Old Bay seasoning.
