I have looked for this recipe for years and was so glad to have finally found it. A relative of mine made this years ago and I asked for the recipe, but never received it. I used one can of fruit cocktail and chopped up two bananas and an orange and threw it in there. It was delicious! Thanks for giving me a new dish for this Easter that I will use many times over!

I've been making this for years, and never knew it had a name!  This is an unusual salad, but is very well received.  It's cool and refreshingly sweet, but not sugar-ey. Good w/grilled chicken.

I've tried this before, but it was called "Rosamarina Salad."  It's a nice, light treat, however, I will add a little more sugar next batch I make.  Not sweet enough for my taste, even with the addition of the whipped topping.  Also, I might consider chopped pineapple instead of crushed next time as well.

This salad is great!  It makes a lot though, so you might want to cut it in half.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe, however I have made this in the past and I use Acini De Pepe pasta and the kids go wild!  We have called it Frog egg Salad in the past!

This is also known as ambrosa salad and this recipe is DELICIOUS!!  I made it for a bridal shower and so many people commented that it was the best ambrosia salad they've ever had!!!  This salad does feed a lot more than the number of servings listed though--we doubled it because we were having 20+ people and it was way too much--but luckily it was so good that people took containers home!

I found this to be very mediocre.  I do not like pasta and fruit combined. It serves more like 58 than 8.  Way too much salad, half my guests didn't eat theirs.

This salad is a hit! had 15 people over for a multiple birthday celebration this weekend and Everyone had seconds! Yes, it Does make alot and I did have leftovers, but the leftovers were gone the next day. The changes I made were to use the Extra Creamy Cool Whip, I ommited the cherries and used fresh blackberries and raspberries. Also, I added a splash of Real Mexican Vanilla while cooking the pineapple mixture.

This is very similar to one I make called "frogeye salad" - everyone loves it!  The differences are:  instead of orzo, mine uses half a package of Acine De Pepi (hard to find).  I also use one less egg, and instead of the big can of crushed pineapple, a small can of crushed and a big can of chunks.  And I usually put in a bigger can of mandarin oranges.  Then, I only put about 2/3 of the whipped cream in and use the remainder to top the whole thing and then drop the cherries on top in a festive pattern - it's particularly cool in my blue bowl for the fourth (blue bowl, white background, red stripes of cherries!

This is some seriously good stuff! Had it in Michigan at a party, asked the hostess what was in it. Then came back here and found the recipe!! Who knew, orzo and fruit!! Even hubby finally tried it and said it was good. Couldn't be easier, thanks Linda!

This was very good, different from the regular ambrosia salad, but still tasted similar.  I can't say it was a huge hit, hence the 4 stars, but it was worth making. I may use this one again.  I cut the recipe in HALF and it STILL made a ton (enough for 15-20 easy).  Next time it will be one quarter of the original!

WOW!!! I worked the primary election on Tuesday and made this for my dish to bring. It definitely makes a HUGE bowl, but guess what?  I had none left to bring home! And I have never had so many ask for a recipe before. And when asked what was in it, they were amazed to find out it had orzo. Absolutely the best lightest refreshing dessert. A MUST TRY!!! Yummo...Thank you so much for this recipe and I will be making it alot. Claudia

I really liked this.  I had some left over cooked angel hair pasta so I used my pastry cutter in a big bowl and cut the noodles all into little bits.  Then put the rest of the ingredients.  I did 1/2 everything and it still makes enough for about 10 people.  Great way to use up noodles not used for the dinner.  Thank you so much Linda for posting this great recipe.

I made this salad according to the directions.  I really didn't care for it.  I'm not sure if it was a texture issue with the orzo or just the fact that it was pasta in a sweet salad.  I didn't think the orzo went with the salad.  I won't make it again.  I must add that some of the people that tried it really loved it.

We have always used acini de pepe for this salad and referred to it as Frog Eye Salad. We omit the cherries and use three cans of mandarin oranges(whole) as well as a cup of mini marshmallows. We can't have a family gathering without it!

This recipe makes A LOT of salad, I would cut in half until you know your group likes it. It was very tasty, I wasnt able to chill over night but otherwise followed the recipe. Tt was very light and tasty, sweet but not too sweet.  Good summer salad!

This is delicious as written but it is fun to add other fruits if you'd like. I did cut this recipe in half and it easily serves 6. Don't make the full recipe unless you're cooking for an army. I did eventually start using Acini Di Pepe Pasta, we like the smaller, round pasta better than the orzo.

I sent this with DH today for a company picnic and he came home with requests for copies of the recipe, so I guess it was a hit.  I made only half a recipe, which was plenty and replaced the cherries with strawberries.  I will make it again for our annual Memorial Day BBQ and add more fruit.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this recipe as well however I also add 2 kiwis, 2 different types of apples preferably a granny smith and a red delicious, and 2 bananas.  I also don't add the cherries until last because they can change the color of the mixture to red - nice if you want that but I don't.  Also, if you are like me and can't handle too much sweet double the amount of fruit and pasta for a double portion of salad and it won't be overly sweet.  Or I suppose you can use splenda or stevia in place of the sugar but I haven't tried that yet.

This is the same recipe that My Aunt makes! I make once in a while now also as it is a favorite of mine. I sometimes use whipped cream instead of cool whip.

this is a great recipe. I make it a few times a year and it's great for a large gathering. I believe the other name for this salad is Frogeyed salad. I am making this for Easter Sunday for a large gathering.
