Being from former Yugoslavia myself, I can tell you that you are on the right track with this dish - it's called a mussaka. Anyway, what you are missing is a layer of potatoes in the middle. The original dish is layered so that you first put a layer of potatoes on the bottom, than a layer of meat, a layer of potatoes in the middle, than another layer of meat, than top it off with another layer of potatoes. Otherwise, the dish would be too heavy on the meat side. Also, there is an allspice that is greatly used in that region, which adds a specific taste to the original dish. The spice is called "vegeta" and you can find it in many international markets.

If you make it without that spice, make sure to add some spices to the potatoes before you layer them. I usually add salt, pepper, paprika and some parsley. Enjoy!

The taste of the meat/veggie mixture alone merits 5 stars definitely...but there was something starchy lacking in this dish. Despite layering the potatos on top & bottom, there was still an overabundance of meat. (While we all like meat, we ended up having to heat up so leftover rice to accompany the dish.) Some nice ideas might be to serve it with egg noodles, rice or to use MUCH more potato (and perhaps mix the potatos in with the meat prior to baking?) On a separate note, I would definitely recommend including the ground cloves. I'm not a huge "clove" fan either, but I used it anyway and the result was fantastic! (If you are still wary, try a dash instead of a pinch...trust me, your taste buds will thank you.)  Again, a thoroughly tasty dish which everyone loved...just lacking some starch accompaniment.

Wonderful -smells at 6 stars - even better than it tastes at 5 stars.  Use very lean ground beef. Add two cloves garlic, part with the ground beef to be ground, part with the vegetables when cooked. Add 2.5 times potatoes - about 1/2 chopped in smallish cubes in the mix of ground beef and vegetables, plus bit more spices and wine. I simply pushed the ground beef to the side after browning and cooked the vegetables on the other side of the pan... YUM -This left the most wonderful taste in our mouths for over an hour afterwards and made the whole house smell good.

This recipe doesn't have that WOW factor, but it is interesting. Interesting good I would say. It is quick to make...I had it in the oven within 20 minutes. I did make a few changes. I didn't bother with the olive oil, because the dripping from the beef were sufficent to do the vegetables. I cut the black pepper down to 1/4 tspn and reduced the red pepper flakes to a pinch based on the reviews I read that the dish was spicy. Even with those reductions the dish had plenty of spice, but also stayed "kid friendly" for my 4 and 6 year old. I also doubled the salt and added garlic powder. The 2 tblsn of half and half cream you add at the end of preperation seemed not to really contribute any real taste or texture ( cream-like )quality to the dish, so when I make this again, I will probably omit it. Also next time I make this recipe I will add more potatos, because the ratio potatos/meat is heavily on the meat side. I think I will cube 1 or 2 potatos mixing it up with the beef and still using sliced potatos for the top and bottom.

I REALLY liked this one! There is so much flavor to it! The only thing I left out was the celery since the poor stuff was quite wilted and sick looking in my fridge! (It did go straight into the trash by the way!!!) Anyway....I added a touch more red wine, I chooped baby carrots instead of shredding one, 4 potatoes and a little extra cinnamon. There is something so devine about mixing beef with flavors like cinnamon...I love it! Hubby is a huge meat and potatoes kind of guy and he went to town on this dish! There weren't any leftovers! This will be a regular at my house....but will be known as the garbage dish.....I had part of a pepper, part of an onion, a small amount of red wine from the night before, potatoes that needed to be used up.....and this dish used up all the leftover stuff so I didn't have to toss it! Great flavor! Thanks for sharing!

I am serbian. And this dish is actualy called musaka ( similar to greek mousakka) . I usually slice a lot more potato layers, to make it at least 4 layers of potato and 3 of meat mixture, potato goes on top. In the last 10 minutes of baking you add mixture of 5-6 eggs and little milk all over top and bake it for 10 more minutes. That is it!

We don’t mix milk w/ meet but all ingredients (minus the ½ & ½) really appealed to me & took a chance.  Very glad we did.  For those of you w/ the same food laws (or wish to make this a little less caloric… ), we increased the wine & water by 1/4c.  We sautéed all vegetable prior to browning meet.  Other than the mentioned changes, we followed the recipe as written.  Something different using grounds meet.  Thanks!

This was really, really good and best of all I had every thing in my pantry. It reminded me of Greek mousaka with the cinnamon, nutmeg and ground beef.  It was interesting, but in a good way.  There were a couple of things I did a little different from the original recipe.  I browned the beef and then put the veggies and seasonings in (I would have liked to have figured out how to do it in one pan, but didn't want to press my luck).  I couldn't figure out why you needed to take the beef out or add the extra oil.  It turned out just fine.  Next time I would only use one rib of celery and cut it up fine since my onion and red pepper (didn't have green) were chopped up fine.  I also didn't have any half and half, but I had sour cream and I added 2 tablespoons and it was fine.  This was fast and easy and tastey.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Wish there was a 10 star option!! I didn't have high hopes for this - it's a casserole, for cryin' out loud - but between my 4 year old and myself, we finished the whole pan! I made some MINOR changes - I added a drizzle of honey after I mixed the veggies, meat, and spices for a touch of sweet, and I added a drizzle of cream to the bottom of the casserole dish before i layered the potatoes and then antoher drizzle to the top layer of taters, just so they'd get soft. Also seasoned the taters w/ salt and pepper. Word of warning - once you take the first scoop out, it starts to look kinda gross.. doesn't matter! Tastes SO GOOD!

I made this last night almost exactly as written (I only had a few strips of red and yellow pepper-no green, I probably used slightly more than a "pinch" of cinnamon and cloves and I put a potato layer in the middle). We thought it was really good. Last night for supper I thought that I had used too much cloves but today the leftovers at lunch tasted perfect. My 3 year old didn't like it but that was not too surprising as he doesn't like a lot of meat. My husband is generally a picky eater and he had seconds.

This a crowd-pleaser!! I followed some other reviews and included garlic, doubled the red wine, and put an extra layer of potatoes.  I also make a VEGETARIAN version with 2 cans of drained garbanzo beans instead of the ground beef.  I just sautee the veggies first, and add the beans after the veggies are cooked.  I made the two versions for a party the other night, and the vegetarian one was VERY popular.  Next time I will include a can of garbanzos into the meat version, too.  Even the little kids at the party loved the casserole.  We served it with rice and sour cream.  One other minor change -- I used plain yogurt instead of half-and-half.  But I think that could be left out if you wanted a lactose-free dish.  If you make the vegetarian version, then you can have a lactose-free, gluten-free, and meat-free dinner that's super tasty!! Trust me, IF you have any leftovers, you won't have to throw them out.

This is very good, and even better the next day. The flavor is kind of reminiscent of French meat pie.  I like to prepare a bag of shredded hash browns with some chopped onion, salt and pepper and layer that beneath and on top of the meat.  It gives a nice fluffy potato taste without being like mashed potatoes, and I run it under the broiler last thing to crisp up the top. Good stuff!

We enjoyed the combination of spices and vegetables in this dish.
Something that I will make again but reduce the amount of "juice" from the ground beef next time.

Excellent!  My 30-year old son said it's the best dish I've ever made (and I'm a gourmet cook)!!  Like others, I made slight changes based upon the reviews.  I added 2 minced garlic cloves to the veges while they were cooking, doubled the liquids, and used 2 Large cubed potatoes that I added to the mixture before baking.  In addition, I used ground turkey and a red pepper (didn't have green).  We both found it irresistible and had to have seconds.  Wonderful with a glass of Rioja red wine!

The meat mixture is so nicely seasoned, it tasted great, however as a whole this dish was not a success for me. The potatoes needed seasoning and would have looked and tasted better if the top layer was browned towards the end of the cooking time. The casserole itself crumbled all over our plates, I think it needs something to bind it together but I'm not sure what...

This was awesome! I added a potato to the meat (cubed small, about 1/2in or so) and I've got to say they became the best part of the dish. They soaked up all the flavours and coloured all the way through-reminded me of roti potatoes. Keep the cinnamon at a pinch but don't be too shy with the ground clove. I also doubled the paprika, added a couple dashes of cumin and tumeric and ignored the wine outright. However, I felt the dish lacked a saucy quality, so perhaps the addition of the wine would allow for a richer juice. I'm using it next time, plus more liquid in general. Finally, I would suggest either putting the potato slices you'd place on top on the bottom instead, or simply using the top taters to hold in the moisture and chucking them before eating. They didn't cook up nicely at all. They dried out on top but stayed undercooked throughout the rest of the slice. Oh, and the cream isn't terribly important, so don't go running out to buy a carton of cream. I just happened to have it on hand, but I wont bother next time. I hope this is helpful, thanks so much for this recipe, it really is wonderful!

I've tried lots of new recipes lately without much success.  Finally a winner....last night's Serbian Beef w/Veggies turned out great.   Hubby loved it and suggested it for future potlucks.   Picky teens loved it and even went back for seconds.  Great option for ground beef with a tasty, unique flavor!

I followed the recipe fairly closely, only omitting the cream since others said it mattered little and we don't usually add those extras anyway.  I did dice up the celery really small so it would be more akin to the diced peppers & onions.  Since I didn't have green pepper, I used 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow which was actually nice since the celery already contributed a green color.  I also added minced garlic to the sauteed veggies, onion salt & garlic powder to the browning beef.  The other spices I used as suggested except probably only about half the crushed red pepper (and the dish was spicy enough).  I dissolved the boullion in the water before adding to the mix to make sure it wasn't still lumpy.  I doubled the wine to make sure there'd be enough broth to keep the dish moist and cook the potatoes.
As for the potatoes, I sliced 6 medium size red potatoes,  with skin on, for the the top and bottom layers (1/2 each).  I also peeled and cubed 2 medium size yams which I added to the beef & veggie mixtures.  However, I sauteed/steamed them with the carrots for a bit before adding them since to make they'd be cooked enough.  Baked 50 mins w/cover, 10 mins without.  Delicious!

Really good! It tastes like authentic Balkan food and reminds me of Bosnia.  Anyone making this recipe should use 4 potatoes instead of 2 and make sure the bottom is completely covered with them. Also, use 50% more paprika.

I added an extra cubed potato to the beef mixture. I wasn't sure about it at first bite, but after a couple more it's addicting! My sister thought it was one of the best things I've made off the site!

Very tasty. Made this with a crumbled soy product instead of the ground beef because that's what we had. I do think it would have tasted better with actual beef. The clove/cinnamon flavor was very subtle; I might add a bit more next time (because I will make it again). I must have sliced the potatoes too think though, because the layers on top burned. While I like the simplicity of just slicing the potatoes, a may try this again with mashed potatoes on top (more like a shepard's pie) or I may just cube and incorporate them into  the mixture. I also think this would make an excellent filling for samoas! Seems like something you could make a double batch and freeze.

Great casserole.  My family loved the full flavor.  I will definitely make it again and use more potatoes next time.

This was really good! I recommend it for a winter night, not a warm one like I made it for! :) 

I reduced the ground beef and added potatoes. Next time, I will add more veggies and decrease the red pepper flakes, as it was a bit spicy for me [update - used a pinch the second time and still too spicy...will leave out next time...update #2 - it's apparently the black pepper quantity that is killing me]. Also, I cooked for 40 minutes, with the foil off for the last 5.

This was really very good ~ different, but in a subtle way. It has just a tiny bit of heat.  I do think that for the sake of simplicity the steps could be pared down without altering the integrity of the recipe. I browned the beef (lean)  in a large cast iron skillet and left it there, adding the vegetables without removing the beef and without adding the olive oil. Those extra steps seemed unnecessary to me. I then moved the beef mixture to the side of the pan and layed the potato slices on the bottom, then added the rest to the top, covered and baked as directed. It made for easy cleanup. If you don't have the cream, no problem. I don't think it added much to the recipe. We all thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and I would make it again. Thank you for sharing it here.

I made this for a group of people and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did make some changes based on the other reviews; I doubled the recipe but I did not double the cinnamon or cloves...I also tripled the potatoes and added an extra layer between two layers of meat.  I also added a fine layer of mozz/cheddar shredded cheese to the top in the last 10 minutes of cooking and took off the lid for that final 10 minutes; I think it made a huge difference becuae otherwise the potatoes on top were dry and tasteless.    I will most definitely be making this again!!  Its always good to find a new way to do ground beef.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  My family loved it and it will definitely become a dish that we make over and over again.  I took the suggestions of a few others by doubling the potatoes and easing up a bit on the chopped vegetables, but I kept everything else as is.  It was perfect, perfect, perfect...

My love for this recipe stems from the spice/flavor combination.  I had my doubts but I thought that the combination was absolutely delicious.  Don't change a thing when it comes to the flavor when you make this dish.  This is a keeper!

My fiancée is eastern European and his mom makes a dish similar to this that he loves. I used small yellow potatoes so I didn't bother peeling them. I sliced them fairly thin and then par-boiled for about 10 minutes, then drained well and let them cool. I used smoked paprika and added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic when I added the spices to the meat/veggie mixture.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of water because I had some in the fridge to use up, then skipped on the bouillon cube. Also doubled the amount of all liquids.  The recipe is right in calling for just a pinch of cinnamon and cloves...they added a beautiful aroma without being overpowering. Allspice would have been nice too.  I did 3 layers of potatoes instead of just 2 because some other reviewers mentioned that they thought it would be better with more. I also sprinkled each layer of potatoes with just a touch of vegeta seasoning (careful not to make it too salty though!) I made this the night before and we popped it in the oven the next night for dinner. Reduced the heat to 350 and cooked for about 30 mins only since I had parboiled the potatoes. Then uncovered and cooked about 15 mins longer to get the top potatoes a little crispy. It was fantastic!  Will be making this one again!

I didn't have celery so I left that out and the red pepper flakes.  I used a mix of regular potatoes and sweet potatoes...it was great!  My 2 year old ate it up!  My five year old wasn't a fan, but I never get both of them to like the same thing.  I did do the middle layer of potatoes as was suggested and thought the mean to potato balance was good.  Used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and cloves as a pinch as people suggested too.  The house still smells great.

We really liked this. I omitted the oil as it was unnecessary with the ground beef juices. I increased the veggies by adding a sliced zucchini, 2 chopped tomatoes and about half a pound of sliced mushrooms, and went a little heavy handed with the seasoning to flavor the additional vegetables. I used 3 small Yukon gold potatoes and left the skin on to retain nutrients, and included a middle potato layer. This was a nice use of ground beef that didn't involve my fall-back Mexican seasoning combos. I will definitely make it again, but I think I'll keep adding extra veg because they make the serving sizes large without many added calories.

A Serbian friend came over to try this dish the first time I made it and told me I could substitute the potatoes with eggplant also!  I'm going to try that next!  All of the spices work wonderfully together!

I used red instead of green pepper, but everything aside, browned the beef and drained, then added all but the potatoes in the skillet and cooked them on the stovetop. The meat was better than any other I have made, or perhaps the novelty of cooking Serbian style made me joyful...We decorated a plate with spinach, but on some czech potato pancakes, a serving of the meat, and topped with sour cream dollop. YUMMY!

Well the smell is 5 stars for sure but it's currently in the oven. I'm almost wanting to call my neighbor to come over and try it. I'm excited. I hope it tastes as good as it smells! I did forget the bell pepper but didn't have any anyways and same with the wine. I hope it doesn't make too much of a difference. I was just really wanting to cook something tonight with what I had since I don't get food stamps till tomorrow i was just itching to cook. I tasted a little bit before I threw it in the oven and it was really good. i added mushrooms and zuchinni as well.

The meat and veggie filling is simply delicious. I added more wine (1/4 cup total instead of 1/8); omitted the celery (don't like the taste, and it's not really an Eastern European thing); added garlic to the ground beef while browning plus garlic to the veggies when cooking; used just a pinch of ground cloves. In other reviews people were saying that there is not enough starch as it is, so I made mashed potatoes and spread them on top of the meat/veggie filling. Stuck it in the oven for 20 min, and ended up with the most amazing Serbian take on a Shepherd's pie ever! Next time will try to make in the suggested way with potatoes sliced, etc.

Made this for all my brothers and sisters tonight and they cleaned out both pans!! I did make a few changes though because I didn't have certain ingredients. I didn't have paprika, cloves or red wine so I added garlic powder, nutmeg, and extra water.  I also skipped the bullion and used half ground beef, half ground deer. I never actually tried the casserole myself simply because I try to eat healthy. But my family enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks so much!! :D

This dish is wonderful!  I had to omit the bell pepper, because one of us is allergic, so I added extra celery and carrots.  Also, I used butter to saute the vegetables, and then added the beef to that and cooked it all together.  I omitted the bouillon (I'm not that fond of MSG), used a little over 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and added extra water instead of the wine (only because I didn't have any red wine on hand today).  I also used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, again because that's what I had on hand.  The dish turned out extremely well, though, and we all enjoyed it!

My family loved this. I thought the spice mix was definitely "unique", and I alone would've given it a 4 but my family protested my rating!

One way to make this dish super simple to prepare was to bring out my food processor. I was able to chop, shred and slice all the veggies, which cut down significantly on the prep time. 

Next time I will add one additional layer of potatoes in the middle. The potatoes were my favorite part, and there just weren't enough of them. 

This recipe perfectly served two adults a 6 and an 8 year old. I don't think it would've made enough for 4 adult servings without signifcant additional side dishes.

K, first of all, I didn't have cloves.  Just feel like I need to mention that for all those people who freak if you don't follow the recipe to a "T" lol!  I actually liked this even tho I was almost positive that the cinnamon would over power the dish.  I also suspected the potatoes would be under-cooked after only 40 mins.  Much to my amazement, the flavour was great and potatoes perfectly cooked.  Oh, I uncovered for last 10 minutes and sprinkled with some cheese (!) Yes another change to the recipe... ha ha ha!

I noticed the comment about throwing away limp celery.  Non,non,non, au contraire, just cut into lengths that will cover with water, a glass or measuring cup.  Put it fridge until crisp once again.  I don't know how wilted it has to be before it will not come back to life but if it's black THEN don't even try

Wow!This is so very tasty. Followed the recipe exactly. Want to find a way to make the top look better-maybe a light crumb coating. This tasted better even the next day,and so simple to make!

This was exactly what I was looking for when I started tonight's dinner search. Something with hamburger and potatoes and a nice flavor. The kids loved it. I doubled the recipe and spiced it exactly as directed in a 13x9 pan. Changes I made were using milk instead of half/half, omitting green peppers and wine and adding a few cubed potatoes during the saute of the vegetables. All the leftovers were eaten the next day which is very rare in my home. The only odd thing about the dish was the bottom potatoes were seasoned because they absorbed what the meat did not. The top layer of potatoes were plain and white. But it made for a nice flavor abstract so it didnt all seem the same.

I was looking for something new to use some of the ground Elk I have and saw this recipe.  We enjoyed it even though I had to leave out the green pepper.  I was sceptical about the cloves but it called for such a small amount I decided to give it a try and am very glad that I did.  The spices were just right and I will make this again.

I just got finished making and eatting this dish. I changed a few things because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used chicken broth instead of wine, I added cream of mushroom soup to the meat mixture and I didn't have cloves so I left it out. The meal was very tasty and u can definitely taste the cinnamon and red pepper, the only thing I didn't care for was how greasy it turned out but other then that it was good.

I have made this several times and the results are quite good. I just add the veggies to the ground beef when frying. Once that is browned I add the other ingredients, including the potatoes, to the skillet to mix completely before pouring into the pan I intend to bake it in. The spices are just right!

Excellant recipe!  Hubby said it was a do-over!  Did not like the fact that the potatoes looked gray when it came out of the oven.  Will proably blanch the potatoe slices next time.

Great recipe!  I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it - will definitely use again.  It was a nice change of pace using different spices with the ground beef.  I would also recommend using more potatoes as many others have suggested.  Otherwise the recipe by itself is still 5-star.

I made this with a few small changes.  I didn't add water, I just used the equivalent amount of wine only.  I also used nutmeg instead of cinnamon, added garlic and Worchestershire sauce.  I saw a couple of reviews saying there was too much meat, so I layered with an extra layer of potatoes in the middle - lasagne like.  Other than those small changes, this dish ROCKED.  So full of flavor!

Fantastic comfort food! I left out the crushed red pepper and still found this dish to have plenty of flavor and heat. The unique flavor of the spices with the mixture of beef, veggies and potatoes makes this recipe top notch.  I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes really thin. I can't wait to make this again!

The flavour was okay, but a pound of ground beef wasn't enough:  Each forkful was chopped vegetables with a tiny bit of, if any, meat.  If you're concerned about it becoming dry, don't saute' the veggies as long--they'll cook-down and release moisture while baking.  I browned meat in a Teflon pan, wiped pan clean, then did veggies:  Didn't use grease or olive oil.

This dish was tasty, but a bit on the bland side for my taste.  However, I will definitely make it again.  It was an easy weeknight meal that my kids (3 & 6) liked.  My rating reflects the ease of the preparation, good from a nutritional standpoint, and that it was family friendly.  A few modifications:   I added an extra carrot as well as about 4 large mushrooms, finely chopped.  Both added extra nutrition and tasted good.  I also increased the potatoes to 5 fist-sized potatoes, which worked well.  I increased wine to 1/2 cup and substituted 3 Tbsp milk plus 2 oz neufchatel (reduced fat cream cheese) for the 1/2 and 1/2 since it's what I had on hand and it worked great.  Served it with green beans.  Would also be good with green salad.  Nice and easy!

This is really, REALLY good. I started the recipe and had it cooking and when it came time to peel the potatoes, I discovered that I only had one left! I used the last potato as well as two sweet potatoes and it turned out great. I think I even preferred the sweet potatoes. I'll be making this a lot. Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good.  Like others, I was a little scared of the cinnamon and cloves.  But you can smell them more than actually taste them.  I followed the advice of others and added more potatoes.  I put 1 1/2 potatoes on the bottom, then meat, then 1 1/2 potatoes on the top.  I also added the cream of mushroom soup instead of the half and half.  I increased the water to  3/4 cup as well.  It probably would be good with cream of celery soup, too.  
I left out the bell pepper (don't like it), the celery (didn't have any) and the red pepper (don't like it).  I also used chopped baby carrots as I didn't have shredded carrots or the regular carrots.  
I cooked the meat first and added the vegetables to the meat, without the olive oil.  (Others mentioned the dish was too oily.  If you use super lean meat, it's not a problem.)  This would probably be good with any vegetable like mushrooms or maybe a little zucchini.  
I also turned down the heat to 400 and covered the dish with foil, as others noted that the top potatoes got too dry.  I only cooked it for 50 minutes in my stoneware casserole.  I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top and let it sit in the oven a couple minutes at the end.  That was really good.  
The hubby liked this dish pretty well, so I'll be adding it to the rotation.

This dish is really great! My husband loves when I make it, which is usually every two weeks. I will say, I've tweaked it a bit though. 

First, I make sure to cut the potatoes thin so that they cook in the time allotted. Otherwise, like the first time I made this, they would take forEVER to cook. I also added a lot more spices, including garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and a lebanese/middle eastern spice mixture called "7 spices" which is a exactly what it says: a blend of 7 different spices. I also don't measure. I just add a dash here and there and taste. If I feel I need more of a certain spice, I add more. In a separate bowl, I added salt, garlic powder, and paprika to the potatoes and mixed them with my hands to make sure the potatoes were all coated evenly, otherwise they'd be too bland. Last time I made this, I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over each meat mixture and on the top potato layer and it was a great addition that I'll continue to always do now. Oh, and I don't add the half-n-half because I don't want the added fat, and it still tastes great. 

Also, I have three layers of the meat mixture and three of the potatoes. And when it's done cooking, I will broil the top for a few minutes to get it slightly crispy.

We loved the combination of favors in this dish. I was skeptical about the cinnamon and cloves, but trusted the reviews I read, and went for it. I chopped up a potato and threw it in the ground beef mixture, and sliced another extra potato to add a middle layer, meaning I used 4 potatoes total. I was trying to stretch the dish to feed my family of 7. It worked well. Everything else was followed, except I used a 2 tablespoons sour cream instead of half-and-half (as I read someone else had done), and a couple splashes red wine vinegar instead of red wine.  I think it's a pretty forgiving recipe. I want to remember this one as a way to make a pound of ground beef go a little further.

As others have mentioned, the seasoning for the meat is excellent! I did make a bunch of changes based on what I had availability and due to time restrictions. For vegetables, I only used onion and shitake mushrooms. I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. I used vegetable bouillon instead of beef bouillon. And I used milk instead of half and half. The crazy, major change I made was that I did everything on the stove. I cooked the beef in a frying pan and simultaneously cooked the onions, mushrooms, and potatoes in a separate pan. When the beef was done (all seasonings and liquid added), I added this to the potato mixture. I then covered this and let the potatoes cook in the liquid from the beef. It turned out surprisingly well! I do want to try in the oven next time.

In the meat mixture at the very end I put in 1/2 teaspoon paprika (smoked paprika is really great). You need to add enough liquid to just reach the top potatoe layer (I put a little water, wine in the pan used to saute the meat and swish it around) then pour over the potatoes. After the water is absorbed (if not absorbed after 1 hour I add quick oats around the edges to absorb the liquid and thicken), uncover the dish and leave in the oven for 5-10 minutes so the top is a golden brown. 

P.S. When I am in a hurry I use 2 boxes of Scalloped potatoes and the sauce included, make sure you leave out the salt and boullion since the sauce mix is salty. Sometimes I use applesauce to hold the meat together if I am out of eggs. Be creative add cheese, or french cut green beans, etc.

This is the second time that we have tried this dish. The first time I was way heavy handed with the red pepper. We loved the taste but it was so hot we could not breath afterward, LOL. This time I used about half what is recommended and am looking forward to really enjoying this dish. I love the cinnamon, clove, allspice and paprika mix. Oh by the way I used all the veggies it called for and the threw in a half a package of frozen veggies on top of that and still used 4 red potatoes for layers on top and bottom. I used Better Than Bouillon, a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and increased the wine to 1/2 cup. I also thickened the sauce with corn starch and water since I increased the liquids by quite a bit. My husband and I are both meat and potato people and I suspect this is going to a easy go to dish. Thanks for sharing this.

I am giving it 5 stars because the flavor was really great!  It truly only feeds 4 people, though.  Not a big issue I will just add more meat next time.  

I can see how some people had problems with the potatoes not being tasty.  I seasoned every layer with s&p and paprika.  I then dotted the potatoes with duck fat and cooked uncovered.  The potatoes came out slightly crisp and oh so good!  

Oh and I took one reviewers idea and didn't remove the beef to cook the veg.  I just undercooked the beef before putting all the veg in to cook.  Easy peasy.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! instead of wine (dont drink) and water i used a vegatable broth, didnt have paprika used basil, used 3 potatos. next time will propably omit the half and half and will probably just cook it stove - the layered potatos on top didnt seem to taste as cooked as i like..

I found this recipe after searching the site for a ground beef recipe and after reading the reviews decided to try it...certainly glad I did.  My husband, daughter and I all enjoyed the flavor. I used a port wine I had on hand...next time I'll use a different red wine.  Will definitely make this again.  Very interesting flavor and just the right spice.

My family loved this! What a great alternative to shepherd's pie! I pretty much followed the recipe but added minced garlic (I add this to eveything) and left out the cloves. I used about a half tsp chili flakes instead of the crushed red pepper and it had a nice bite to it. This is a keeper for sure!

This was good, and easy to make with most ingredients already on hand. It didn't "wow" me, but I will likely make again. I didn't have crushed red pepper so I used a dash of cayenne. I liken it to a different take on traditional shepherds pie.

My husband is on a low carb diet so we make this with ground turkey and skip the potatoes. I also use three tablespoons of greek yogurt instead of the half and half. The result is a low fat, low carb meal with lots of flavor! The mix of the spices is so unique. This is a keeper for us!

I'm not a big meat person, but this is delicious!  I think my hubby went back for fourths, but who's counting ;)  I added extra carrots, celery and potatoes.  I diced up a little potato and added it to the meat mixture and also did 3 layers of potatoes (i.e. pototoes on the bottom, meat layer, potatoes, meat layer, and potatoes on top).  I also cut back on the salt and added extra wine and half & half.  Overall...delicious!

I made this tonight and it was really good. It reminds me of Greek moussaka because of the cinnamon in the meat. I love that! It's a very flavorful, spicy, dish but I have to agree with others that it seems to be missing something, and what that something is I am just not sure. But I will make this again! I doubled the recipe but cut back on the black pepper and I forgot to put in the green pepper. Delicious, and my 4 and 3 year olds ate it up!

This is not bad, but I definitely think it's more than 4 servings--unless you've got huge eaters, like teenage boys!  Despite all of the spices, I didn't really think this was all that flavorful.  I topped the potatoes with paprika, and I doubled most of the spices (except the red pepper and salt and pepper) bc I used ground turkey, which is typically less flavorful than ground beef.  I also added Montreal Steak seasoning, which typically packs a punch.  Even with all that, though, I thought it was bland.  I think I'd do a brown gravy next time instead of the half and half; I, too, didn't think it added any flavor or anything to the dish.  I used 6 potatoes because I had small red potatoes and layered twice, which I liked, but I didn't quite have enough for a full top layer, so I'd use another potato or two next time.  Overall, pretty decent dish--bf really liked it--but I think it could stand some changes to increase flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an easy recipe to adjust, according your what you have in your cabinets.  

I had the potatoes, beef, some excess bok choy stalks and the usual onion/ seasonings- used saki for the wine.  The half n half mixed in just right at the end.  I threw dices potato on top, since I messed up the cut on my first potato.  

The easy and versatile dish looks great after browning on top for the last few minutes. Wonderful!

An excellent alternative to ordinary casseroles. Additions I made were chopped garlic to the vegetables during the"sweating" stage. Also added fresh thyme. After cooking 45 minutes, I took the foil off of the pan, added a few small dabs of butter, and cooked for an additional 10-15 minutes to get a different texture on the top potato layer. Very tasty!

awesome, I added some chopped potatoes to the mix, about 4 cloves of smashed, chopped fresh garlic, used about 6 ozs of whipped cream cheese instead of the half & half, took the lid off and broiled for 5 minutes after the recommended time AND finally grated fresh parmesean over the top after I pulled it out.  Really the key was the cinnamin and ground cloves, great dish.

I was surprised how much I liked this. It was a great way to use up leftovers and just had a wonderful sweet/smokey taste. I used red pepper instead of green, doubled the potatoes (I can't imagine it with less), used chicken broth instead of water then cut the salt, and finally doused the bottom layer of potatoes with olive oil - I think it would have been too dry without it. Oh and the top layer of potatoes with olive oil too (a yummy habit learned after living with a catalan for a while). In the end I removed the lid to make the top potatoes crispy and more french fired from the olive oil. I also was out of clove and the recipe tasted fine without it. I'll also try this with pork. Great for eaters that don't like exploding flavor, but just hints of spice.

this was an excellent quick meal for our large family of 11. I did make some minor changes. I did like others recommended by dicing potatoes and adding to ground beef then instead of 1/2 and 1/2 I used the beef juices etc and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added garlic to the beef as it was cooking. I did not use the green or red peppers as we have some who cannot eat peppers. The youngest to the oldest (age 98) enjoyed this dinner.

This was awesome!!! I did triple the wine and half/half. Also chopped two additional peeled potatoes and put them in with the meat mixture before putting in the oven. MUCH better this way!!!

yum.  good dinner tonight...made a few changes...omitted the red pepper (for the kids), used  chicken bouillon (it was what I had on hand), added worcestrshire sauce, 2 cloves garlic, and a sprinkle of nutmeg rather than cloves.  Also diced carrots and bottom layer of potatoes, rather than shred and slice.  Reminds me a little of shepards pie.  I will make this one again for sure. thanks!

This is a great recipe, thanks! A family friend from yugoslavia made this for us once but he doesn't speak any english and I never got his recipe. This is pretty close. He puts pork in his with the beef but it is not the traditional way and just beef is the usual way. Instead of wine, water and bouillon I just used canned beef broth. I used more potatoes also, the entire top should be covered. It's so good!

We aren't meat eaters here, so I used a soy crumble substitue and it turned out great!  We added an extra layer of thin sliced potatoes as a middle layer.  We will definitely be making this again.

It's very simple to make and I liked the flavor of the meat filling, but it was very mild.  I'd recommend more spices and taking the cover off at the end to brown the potatoes for better flavor,  texture and visual appeal.  If I make it again, I'd use the filling in pita bread or in phyllo dough.

I made this for my family the other night and from a cooking stand point, it was very easy to make with ingredients that are usually found in almost every pantry, so they are already on hand. As for taste, I really enjoyed it, as did my children and even my husband, who really has nothing to say about food expect "it's good" or "not my thing", told me that he really enjoyed how he could taste every spice and ingredient I put in without one over powering another. I will definately be making this one again!

This was terrific!  We loved the spiciness of the dish.  I followed other review advice and added two cubed potatoes into the mix.  I also used ground Italian sausage instead of ground beef because that is what I had.  I will make this again frequently!

Average - tastes like "beef and potato casserole"  I did three potatoes instead of three and layered them with a layer of potatoes in-between the beef and thought the ratio was perfect.

I was debating whether I should make this because I wasn't sure if I would like the flavor combo.  I made it, and I'm so glad I did.  The cinnamon/beef flavor is unique, but it somehow goes together really well.

I am Serbian - and this is not a Serbian dish. I do know the dish your boyfriend is talking about and it definitely does not have green bell pepper, celery  or cloves and cinnamon in it.  Tnaks for trying though.

I followed the suggestions to add more potatoes, and some garlic salt, and left out the dairy (as we're dairy-free).  Since my daughter is allergic to cloves & cinnamon, I added an apple to give it a little sweetness, instead (I liked that addition, actually), but in the end this was OK, but not amazing.  Cannot imagine it with fewer potatoes!  The meat was pretty dry, regardless of my doubling the wine (as also suggested), even though I baked 5 minutes shorter than suggested time.  I'll finish the dish, but my husband won't go beyond his ONE taste, and my kids are also resisting...trying to figure out how to manipulate it into something else--maybe a shepherd's pie?  Ah well.

We enjoyed this meat and potatoes dish very much; it will be a “comfort food” dish in our home.  I did have to use four potatoes in order to get a good ration of meat to potato but other than that I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  I was going to up the amount of crushed red pepper because we like spicy food, but I am glad that I did not; it was plenty spicy for us and I would think about cutting down on the red pepper if cooking for children.  It tasted pretty mediocre as I went along and I thought I would be disappointed until I added the cinnamon and cloves.  Then we had a winner!  Definitely do not skip the cloves as they really make a difference.  I might advise, too, if you are one of those people who only use a pinch of cloves once a year in your Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, you think about replacing your old spice with a new jar of ground cloves.  Not only will you notice a huge taste difference but the aroma alone is worth the price.

This is fantastic!! Second time I made this I had some ground pork sausage to use up so I added it to the ground beef and since we loved the potatoes in this dish I did chopp one small potato to the sauted vegetables and then sliced up some more for the top. This is delicious!!

Absolutely amazing!  I first made this recipe a couple of weeks ago and it was definately a hit with my husband and my picky 2 year old.  the only thing I did differently was added some chopped potatoes to the veggie mix as per some of the other reviewers' suggestions.  I now make this once a week at my house and my husband always takes the left overs to work with him.

This recipe is very tasty! I would have given it 5 stars if I had not had to make a few changes to add more flavor and to make it a bit more hearty. I started by using 2 lbs of ground beef vs. 1 1/2 & diced 2 potatoes and added them in to the veggie mixture. I am a salt freak so i added a pinch of salt & pepper to the beef while it was browning. I also threw in a clove of garlic & 1/4 cup of red wine. To finish it off, I sliced 4 potatoes for layering vs. 2. After the modifications we're made...WOW!!! So delicious!

Excellent recipe.  We used a red bell pepper instead of a green one because that is all we had and also a chicken bouillon for the same reason.  We used ground turkey instead of ground beef and we doubled the potatoes and maybe next time I'd even triple them.  Instead of half and half, we used 1% milk and that worked out fine.  We put it all in a 8x12 casserole dish and that was perfect.  Delicious exotic flavors.

My wife and I love this. We have been perfecting it for the last year. We have found that using stew meat instead of ground beef gives it an extra yumminess. We definitely use more potatoes than the recipe requires. Giving it more cream and a little lemon juice is also a plus. To top it all off after the bottom layer of potatoes using slices of yellow squash is also something we love on it.

I absolutely loved this dish! I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef for health reasons, so that was one difference.  I also don't cook with alcohol, so I used 3/4 cup of beef broth in place of the red wine, water and meat juices.  I had small red potatoes on hand, and needed to use about 6 of them in order to fill two layers.  Other reviewers have been complaining of this dish not having enough of a starch element, but I completely disagree.  It was well balanced, extremely flavorful, and such a nice change from the norm.  As soon as all of the spices were blended together in the skillet, I knew I was going to LOVE it.  I wasn't disappointed...I will definitely be making this again soon.  Thanks! // I've made this dish 3 times since my original review, and I stumbled upon something which came out of necessity: I needed to prepare the entire dish the night before, so let the meat mixture sit in a large bowl in the refrigerator overnight, and the flavors came together so much better!  I also added raisins upon request which my boyfriend says reminds him of traditional Mexican Piquadillo - everyone loved it!

Thank-you so much for such a tasty recipe!  My family loved this - everyone went back for seconds!  I made no substantial changes to the recipe - I used an extra potato and added a little more red wine to make up for the creme I didn't have on hand.  The spice combo along with the red wine makes the kitchen smell so wonderful.  I will be making this again and regularly! Thank you once again.

My husband loved this, but I wasn't crazy about it.  It is similar to an American pot roast, but with many more seasonings and the meat is ground instead of a roast.  It is baked casserole style.  Very spicy.

This was fairly good, but not as good as many of the reviews had led me to expect. The meat mixture was a bit dry for my taste. If I make it again I'll use more potatoes and perhaps add some crushed tomatoes to the meat mixture.

I have made this dish many times (using red/yellow peppers)   My kids and husband love it.  Excellent.  The only thing I changed was to do it as a skillet meal using potatoes that were already cooked and sliced.

My family and I were disappointed with this recipe. I have to say, from the others reviews I really thought it would be great, and I followed peoples sugestions, etc but it just tasted like a bland shephards pie. We couldn't taste the spices at all which was a shame. I'm giving this 3 stars because it was still a hearty meal, but just not very exciting in my standards. I definitely recommend adding cheese to this if you do make it though... it's the only way my 5-yr-old son would eat it!

I trippled this recipe for company and was not thrilled.  It was dry.  I did all the prep work the night before and added the cream and assembled with potatoes in the morning.  I had two large casseroles and baked them for 2 hours at 350.  Would not make again. Did not give me the wow factor I was expecting based on other reviews.

I tried this for dinner tonight and we liked it very much. I made only a few changes - using milk instead of cream, red wine vinegar instead of wine, and cooking it in rhe microwave. It worked very well. Delicious1

Oh SO good. As suggested, I doubled the potatoes. I grated the carrot and used lactose-free milk and margarine instead of the half and half. This is one of my absolute favorite things to make on here. Everyone should try it. Non red meat eaters could sub ground turkey.

I liked this. The aroma was wonderful. My husband said "ok, but nothing special". The only alterations I made were: left out the wine (didn't have any) and I cooked the veggies & spices with the beef (after it had been browned), leaving out the olive oil. I added another potato, as suggested. I will make it again, but on the stove top. The sliced potatoes can sit on top of the beef/veggies/liquid & steam with the cover on. That way I could thicken up the juices at the end.

I made a few alterations and it was a big hit with my husband and my 3 year old. I didn't have cloves so I threw in a pinch of allspice instead. I doubled the red wine and had to use chicken broth instead of the beef bouillon cube. I doubled the potatoes and instead of 1/2 and 1/2, threw in a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup. It was amazing!

This is the second time I have made this and this time it was better.  I made some changes:  I used more potatoes (sliced 1/4 in. thick), used sour cream mixed with milk instead of half and half and added golden raisins which really made it great!  I highly suggest that!  Will be making this again.  Thanks!

I added a bit more cream and spooned the juice over potatoes at the end of cooking time. Ran it under the broiler under potatoes browned. Will definitely make again, but will probably omit cloves. A great winter supper!

This is Yummy! Any liquid you put in is soaked up by the potatoes lining the casserole. It makes it taste like a wonderful hash. Be careful about the cloves...it could overpower it. I would fix this again and it would be an excellent dish for a potluck dinner.

I made this Serbian dish last night. It was very spicy and fantastic! I read some of the reviews and the only thing I did differently was I added a middle layer of thinly sliced potatoes. So I had 3 layers of potatoes not 2. I lightly salted and peppered all three layers of potatoes. It was a fabulous dish and I'll make it again and again.

Add more potatoes to make a bottom, middle, and top layer.  Decrease black pepper to 1/2 t.  Try it with sweet potatoes?

I only make two changes:  I use beef broth instead of bullion and water and I have a total of 3 layers of potatoes and two layers of meat. Otherwise it would be too meaty. Some users have complained that it needs a binder and from what I've read, this dish normally has 4 to 5 beaten eggs poured in during the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking. So tasty.

I was skeptical of the spices used, but this was absolutely delicious. Only thing I changed was adding a layer of potatoes in the middle, so it was 1 layer potatoes, 1 of meat/veggies, 1 layer of potatoes, 1 of meat/veggies and topped off with potatoes. I took the cover off for the last 10 minutes to brown the top a bit. This is a keeper! Perfectly warm but not overwhelming.

It was very good. I followed the advice to put an extra layer of potatoes in the middle and I skipped the half and half (we have dairy allergies in the house and there was so little, I couldn't imagine that it would make much difference).

As an eastern european, this is a good start to Mussaka but it's missing the extra layers and use of Vegeta (a seasoning). I layered the dish with potato slices on the bottom, sprinkled it with vegeta, added the meat and then repeated until I was left with a layer of seasoned potatoes on top.

I did not use the beef bouillon as it would be too salty. Also I substituted half and half for a mixture of 1 egg and 1 cup milk whisked together and poured it on top of the casserole before baking it.

Having spent some time in Serbia, my family thought this recipe came pretty close to nailing the basic 'taste' of the cuisine.  I 'layered' the potatoes ad meat mixture, and my family liked it!  Will definitely make again.

The meat, vegetables and seasonings in this dish are fantastic.  The potatoes added nothing to the dish, in my family's opinion.  Our son came for lunch the next day and reheated the leftovers.  He too loved the meat mixture but wondered why I added the potatoes.  We all thought the meat portion would be wonderful in a lettuce wrap as it has a lot of flavor. This dish does say comfort and it paired nicely with 'Creamy Spiced Coleslaw' from AR.

Loved it! So interesting and not your typical taste. Exotic and different- my only advice is to cut down the pepper. I followed the recipe without listening to other reviewers because I like to do that before make any changes and I can agree the pepper could be cut down. Delicious though and I couldn't wait to get home the following day to have the leftovers. ! doubled the recipe and made enough for 2 days for a family of 4 with a big appatite. Added another layer of potatoes in the middle as well as seasoned and browned them.

This "Serbian Ground Beef, Veggie, and Potato Bake" is the perfect comfort food, and so easy to make! I learned from the Serbian reviewers that this dish: (a) is "Serbian Moussaka (Musaka)"; (b) is usually layered with more potatoes than what this recipe calls for (I added a middle layer); (c) typically made with VEGETA (a seasoned salt that tastes like parsley and carrots that I was able to get withoug MSG at my supermarket but did not use because I did not especially like it); and (d) may have parsley layered in with the potatoes (which I did). I substituted 1 tablespoon of tomato paste (total) for the ingredients that I wasn't using (red wine, half-and-half cream, and a cube of beef bouillon) to compensate for any loss of flavor. I will be making this again many, many more times. Thank you amanda1432 for sharing your recipe.

Just made this and it's very good. The only thing that I did different is that I drained the fat from the ground beef before adding the olive oil. Thought this would make the dish to greasy. I also did the three layers of potatoes as the other reviewers suggested.

Flavors were okay, but it needed more liquid, perhaps a simple gravy type texture.

Flavorful tips: i cut the pepper down to a generous 1/4 tsp. If you do not have cloves, substitute with Allspice. 
I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper, browned and added the veggies to the dish (undrained meaning I skipped the oil). Do not overcook the veggies as you will be baking this dish. I added 3 cloves of garlic (minced). Add the seasonings as above. Skip the water (no flavor) and double the wine. Throw in bouillon. Skip the half and half and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup sour cream. Slice and season your potatoes with salt and pepper. Butter the bottom of the dish, layer with potatoes, add meat mixture, layer with more potatoes, add meat mixture, top with potatoes. Cover and bake 375 for 40-50 mins until potatoes tender. VERY GOOD!

My family decided that this tasted more like a shepherds pie with cinnamon/clove flavours than moussaka. I followed other reviewers suggestions and made a middle layer of potatoes (4 pots in total) and chopped some fresh parsley to add on top of each potato layer. It was a little bland for us but we still enjoyed it. Thanks amanda1432

I tried this and really liked it. I have made a Mussaka but it took  a lot more time.  Worth it if you have the time.  This was perfect for extra ground beef   and was pretty quick.  I added a layer of squash. Mostly because I had some and needed to use it.   It was great!    I really luv new things to make out of stuff you already have.   Great recipe!

My husband grandparents immigrated from Serbia and he says this reminds him of his grandmother's cooking. It's easy to prepare and healthier than those processed box meals. We have this with a green salad for a complete meal. The leftovers are even better the next day.

Wow! This was great! I used my food processor slicing blade to get even, thin slices of potato. I also followed recommendations and increased the potatoes to about one pound of potatoes.  This was spicy, with a lovely flavor different from anything else I've made. I'll be making this again! Highly recommended!

Great weeknight meal.  I didn't have a green pepper so I used some red cabbage.  I know, not really related but still tasted good.  I put a dollop of sour cream, and maybe added a little more than an 1/8 of a cup of wine;-).  Almost everything in this recipe I could use my CSA share on with the exception of the celery.  My six year old had seconds.

I mistakenly added nutmeg instead of clove. After I realized my error, I added the clove anyways. Those spices plus the cinnamon really made this dish stand out. Based on the reviews of the Serbian and Croatian members, I did three layers of potatoes with a layer of meat in between. I liked mine with sour cream...just a personal preference. I didn't have red wine or beef boullion, but it didn't seem to affect the outcome. This is perfect comfort food for cold, gray weather.

I loved it, it was easy to make and was different but good different! I ate mine with sour cream on top. The cinnamon and cloves add that different but good taste. Will be adding this to my recipe collection.

We liked this. I thought while making this that the tiny amount of wine, cinnamon and clove would not make any difference.  Well I was wrong. You only need a small amount of each. I added another layer of potatoes in the middle of the casserole. All in all I used 5. I did season them with canola oil and seasoned salt before putting them in the casserole.

The smell and flavor of this is wonderful. The whole family liked it too which for me is a major plus. It isn't a flashy dish but it is easy and hearty. I topped my own portion off with a dollop of sour cream.

I've made this a few times now for my family and extended family for a total of 9 people, ranging from 7 years old to 70.  Everyone loves it.  It's been a couple months so I'm making it again tonight at my wife's request. Tastes delicious and easy to prepare.  I skip the wine and the cream, and of course I add a lot more of each ingredient to accommodate the additional servings. Thanks!

We really liked this dish. The spice blend was great and advice from other reviewers like a third layer of potatoes along with a little extra paprika made this perfect. I used apple juice for the wine part. This is a nice change and one we will enjoy in the future.

I loved it! I make it all the time...often double batches. Never lasts long. To cut down on prep time, I put all my veggies in with the meat when it's browning. I don't fully brown the meat before baking so it doesn't totally dry out. I also mix the spices and liquids before pouring it over the meat so it distributes evenly.

This is fantastic!  I did the spices exactly as recipe says. I Didn't have celery, carrots, or bell pepper (weird, right?), so I subbed broccoli. I did add a center layer of potatoes; good call, other reviewer. On top of the uppermost potatoes, I added a mixture of 2 tablespoons almond milk, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and rosemary/garlic seasoning. (Didn't use half-n-half due to some lactose intolerance). Man, this was incredibly flavorful. All family members wanted seconds.

Family devoured it.  I sprinkled salt, pepper and paprika to potato layers.  Used 3 medium potatoes with skins on to make 3 layers. Cooked veggies with meat.  I used 1/2 and 1/2, but not sure how much it adds to dish. Uncovered last 15 minutes to crisp top potato layer.

So glad to see something different! Only changes I made was to use Beef Stock in place of the water and omit the beef bouillon to avoid all the additives they throw in the cubes. I'm avoiding milk so used full fat coconut milk in place of the half & half. I like the suggestion to use an additional layer of potatoes in the middle. I'll do that next time. Overall a VERY good recipe! I will make it again!

We really enjoy this recipe. We love exotic flavors, so I probably double the spices (just eyeballed it) and I always add extra red pepper flake at the table because I like it hot!  I've read reviews that suggest layering the potatoes but I've also just tossed them in and mixed everything together and it still tastes great.

This is one of our favorite recipe.  Very tasty! We do more layers of potatoes and 
pour a concoction of heavy cream and two eggs whipped together over the entire surface of the dish and bake for 15 more minutes, just until set. I would not have it any other way, the serbian way!
Kefir or yogurt or sour cream or half and half can replace the cream in the final concoction.

Major substitutions here since I didn't have many of the ingredients on hand but I wanted to try out the flavors. My husband really liked this recipe (as modified), the kids were "meh". Like other reviewers, it seemed like it was short on potatoes so I used enough potatoes to make 3 layers - a bottom, middle and top layer. I also cooked the potatoes in the microwave before layering them so the oven part was really to melt the cheese. Oh yeah, I added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top hoping that it could assuage any complaints. I left out the celery and bouillon since I just didn't have these. I made the following substitutions with success: 
- ground turkey in place of beef
- vegetable stock in place of water
- butter in place of half and half

Happy cooking!

This was a delicious recipe that I will add to my "must make again" file. The mix of seasonings added so much flavor, I raved over it long after it was gone. My husband can tend to be fussy about "new things" and he really enjoyed it too. Thanks!

This was delicious! The smell that filled our house while it was in the oven was intoxicating. It made me feel so homey and fall-like. The only adjustment I would make next time is adding more salt. I would probably up it to a full teaspoon. But other then that...it was great!! Will definitely make again.

I made this as written, and doubled the potatoes. Enjoyed the flavor of the meat, but the potatoes were soggy on the bottom, and dry on top. Might make again, but place the meat mixture in the bottom and top with mashed potatoes, more like a cottage pie. Thanks for sharing!

I tripled the water, wine and half and half so it would be saucy and mixed with cooked egg noodles (no potatoes) no baking. The family liked it but thought it was "too spicy" so next time I will cut back on black peper and red pepper flakes.

We thought this recipe was very tasty: will prepare again- may add some green olives think it might add to the flavor.

This was great! I followed the advise of a reviewer who mentioned layering the dish with a potato layer in the middle. I did two things differently: 1 large sweet potato in place of the 2 potatoes (b/c it's what we had on hand), and sprinkled the top with crumbled feta cheese. My husband loved it and he had spent some time in Turkey - loves eastern european cuisine! The idea of this dish reminds me of a Turkish layered vegetable bake that I have made for him.

This recipe is brilliant. A really interesting combination of flavours and a hearty meal.

I don't make any changes other than adjusting the amount of potatoes to make sure I've got enough layering the top.

Great recipe!  I made it as given except that I made a sort of parfait, alternating equally sized layers of beef and layers of potato.  I thought this was a great proportion, it would have been way too beefy with less potatoes.  My picky toddler ate it too (because we told him it was shepherd's pie).

Good receipe. More flavor than I was expecting. I did change a few things though. I used ground turkey instead of beef and made sure to add shredded sharp cheddar cheese on the top layer of potatoes.

Taste good.  Added chesse to the top and omitted the ground cloves (didn't have them on hand)  This is a good budget friendly meal.

Very tasty.  I put in a layer of potatos in the middle as suggested in previous reviews.  Without them there would be too much meat.  With them, just wonderful.

Fabulous casserole! I tried this for the first time last night and made it exactly as written. It turned out great. My family really liked the spicy flavor of this dish. Just had some as leftovers, and it was just as good if not better the next day.

This was excellent! I made it at home and it was so tasty that when visiting a friend, THIS is what I decided to make the very next day for her. I would never bring a new dish to a friend but I was very confident with how full of flavor this was. To give it an Arabic twist, I made my Middle Eastern yogurt to put on the side. Plain no fat yogurt, add diced seedless cucumbers, pinch of salt (enough to remove the sour of the yogurt), crushed dried mint, crushed/minced garlic (as strong as you like) Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This yogurt helped in making the dish not feel so heavy.

My husband says this is yummy. He ate three servings.  I used beef broth in place of the red wine, beef cube, and water.  I also dotted butter on top of the potatoes during the last 10 minutes for browning.  Spicy, delicious, economical, and a good comfort food dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this twice and my husband, 4 yr old & I love it!  The combo of paprika, cinnamon & cloves is delicious.  I would agree with the other reviewer who suggested extra lean ground beef or it ends up a little greasy.  This is a great one-dish meal.  The only thing I do differently is I add a lot more potatoes than the recipe calls for - like about 7 potatoes and I add a little extra stock so there's enough to properly cook the potatoes.

It is not the most sophisticated dish but wow, love the unique tastes of this dish.  Everyone in my family loves it too!  I don't always have the half and half but it is still delicious.  I plan to make the ground beef mixture ahead of time and freeze so that I can defrost during the day and pop in the oven with the potatoes when I get home from work.

This one's a winner! I didn't add as much black pepper as the recipe called for (because I'm not a big fan of black pepper) and I didn't have cloves but other than that, I tried to follow the recipe. My husband is very picky and he loved it even after I told him it had cinnamon in it. This recipe is one of our new favorites and definitely one I plan to make again!
(The last 5 minutes of cooking time, I uncovered the dish, drizzled olive oil on the potatoes, and broiled it til it got golden brown on top.)

Amazing flavor.  I usually add more potatoes because we love them, but other than that I don't change anything and the dish always comes out wonderful.  I love how the cinnamon and cloves taste in this dish.  This is definitely something I will keep making for a long time.

I took other viewers advice and cubed the potatoes and mixed into the meat mixture.  This was unlike anything we've had in the past but very delicious.  I agree about the cloves and cinnamon, very necessary.  I couldn't taste the crushed red pepper, I might put in more next time.

"Explosion of flavor!" my favorite quote from Ratatouille is the best way to describe this dish. It's a bit salty, but my husband loves it that way! the only additional items I have added to it were peas and an extra tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream (I've made this twice and forget to add the whipping cream every time until it's in the oven!). I will definitely keep making this dish for my family. :)

Excellent recipe!  I've made a few successful alterations to it.  I can't eat milk, so I leave out the half-and-half entirely, but soy milk can be substituted with decent results.  I also never seem to have the veggies that the recipe calls for hanging around, so I've substituted zucchini for celery, celery seeds for celery, eggplant for celery all with excellent results.  I just made it with yams/sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and it was delish!  I will probably make that last substitution permanently.  Thank you amanda1432 for posting this recipe.

Excellent! A hearty and savory dinner. Served this up with steamed green beans. Didn't have any bell peppers or celery on hand. Added the chopped onion and carrots to the beef while it was browning on the stove. Don't know what half and half is, but I used Tofutti sour cream, which could probably just be omitted.  I also added cumin to the spices, knowing how well it tastes paired with ground beef... Overall an excellent dinner- will definitely be making this on again

What a delicious meal!!  We just prepared this for our family and parents, and everyone went back for seconds.  The only change I would suggest is adding 2-3 cubed potatoes into the meat mixture--it really bulks it up and gives it some much needed starch.  If I could give this 10 stars I would!!!

Followed the recipe exactly. The vegetables ended up being a bit mushy but I could still taste them and feel the texture. I'll probably drop the water and use all red wine next time. With this recipe, using fresh, high quality ingredients makes a huge difference. Meat from the butcher, veggies from the farmer's market, and good wine really bring out the desired flavors.

Very good!!  I was just looking for a recipe to use up what I had in my fridge before I went on vacation, and came upon this recipe.  I didn't have very high hopes for it, but it was delicious!!  The only changes I made were to use white wine instead of red (that was just all I had in the house) and like others had suggested, I used extra potatoes.  All I had were red potatoes, so I ended up using 4 on the bottom and 4 on the top.  This is not a fancy mean, by any means, but it is satisfying, and I love a meat and potatoes dish that the veggies can't really be picked out of.

good dish. I didn't use capsicum or wine, used beef stock, apple juice and dash of rice wine vinegar and cremé fresch and yogurt, all spice, chilli pepper and cinnamon. Partner and I both enjoyed.

The taste just wasn't very appealing. It needed lots of potatos. My husband didn't like the taste and said not to make it much if I decided to make it again.

Interesting flavor, definitely increase the potatoes or it is just nicely flavored meat.  I'll cut back on pepper slightly next time--its got a little too much bite for my taste.

this was a wonderful change to the regular weekday meal.  I saved time by using prechopped frozen veggies and it was a quick and easy recipe. doubled the paprika and left out the half and half.  I will be adding this to our regular fare.

This was REALLY good!  Better than I expected it to be.  The best part was, our youngest (on the autism spectrum and VERY anti veggie) snarfed those veggies down!  I am always looking for ways to make that happen!  I used a yellow pepper instead of green and substituted sour cream for half & half.  I think in the future I will dissolve the boullion in the water and THEN add it.  I also followed the suggestion and added potatoes to the meat mixture.  YUP . . . This was a winner.  Thank you for the recipe!

I have mixed feelings about this dish. I think it is a great start to a recipe but I feel like there were some things left out. Everything was cooked through and I liked the flavor from the cloves and cinnamon. However, with all of the peeling and chopping involved a few things could be added to make it worth it. I think it would be much better with some sort of gravy and more spices to give it more layers of flavor. I added garlic but it still needed something else. I think a little ginger or curry powder would really add to this dish.

Very good!  I made this as directed, except that I used beef broth in place of the water/bouillon and extra beef broth in place of the wine (didn't have any).  I only had 3 medium potatoes but could've used another.  I would probably add an extra carrot next time, too.  DH, however, wasn't a big fan (cinnamon threw him off) so I averaged our ratings to get 4 stars.

The flavor of this dish was good.  I did not use any olive oil-I drained and removed the ground beef and sauted all of the vegetables in the same pan.  As I was doing this, I microwaved 4 potatoes.  I let the potatoes cool, and then sliced them. After adding the meat back in the pan with the vegetables, I added the spices, water, and wine.  Since I did not have half and half, I added about 2 ounces of cream cheese, cubed and a little sour cream.  I stirred this in, and then put everything into a casserole dish as stated in the recipe.  I microwaved it at 70% power for 10 minutes.

This may not be authentic Serbian as another reviewer said, but it sure is good.  I loved the little bit of bite from the red pepper.  I also doubled the paprika and used the Half-Sharp Hungarian from Penzey's.  That give it a lot of character.  I also put three layers of potatoes in the casserole, and the ones in the middle and at the bottom were yummy.  And I did a Julia Child and put in an extra glug or two of wine.  Even with that, it was juicy but not too wet.

wonderful! i used a combination of lamb and beef, it was quite good. I would have liked some more potatoes in the dish so i think next time i will try adding in very thinly sliced potatoes in the center, more like a lasagna preparation.

This is a little labour-intensive for me (I cannot stand for long periods of time to chop veggies/brown meat etc.)), but it is so amazing it is sooooot worth it!  Nicely done! Marvelous flavour.   Even my picky hubby loved it!  Thank you! UPDATE: LOVE THIS -- hubby chopped veggies.  (I added 2 Tbsp pineapple applesauce instead of the oil, two more potatoes and ... WOWSAH!)  Anyway you slice it, this recipe is amazing!

This was good! I totally forgot to add the cream at the end but I don't think it was really missing anything. Next time I might add a beaten egg to the meat mixture to keep it together. My boyfriend called it "Serbian shepherd's pie". My casserole dish is taller than most so I added a layer of potatoes in the middle. Next time I might double up on the spices to make it even more flavourful. I loved the unique taste though - will make again, thanks!

I had such high hopes for this after reading the rave review but taste is subjective.  We did not care for the cinnamon.  But I can't fault the recipe for our tastebuds.  I followed as is and I'm rating 4 stars because it gave me some great ideas that with a few changes I will make it again.  We loved the potatoes which I doubled as many reviewers suggested.

Yum...that's all I can say! Loved the meat/veggie combo- as other reviewers have said, it is a little light on the potato, but I feel like it is a little healthier without all the carbs. However, I definitely think it would be good if you just made the meat and veggies and served over mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing- will definitely make this again!

Other than substituting (a little too much) ground cayenne for the red pepper flakes, I prepared this exactly as directed.  This was very simple and an interesting change of pace.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe to use 2 lbs. of ground beef (except I used 4x the amount of potatoes called for.  We had enough to feed 4 people, with leftovers for my lunch. Ordinarily, this would have fed at least 8 people; we were pigs.  My gosh, it is delicious.  We each ate way too much, but we couldn't help ourselves.  I had a hard time putting the leftovers away instead of eating them, but there simply was no more room in my stomach.  I made a spice cake with caramel frosting for dessert.  That remained untouched until today, quite remarkable since I have 4 teens and a husband with the world's biggest sweet tooth.  Thank you, Amanda1432, for posting this recipe.

I made this dish for my husband, I don't eat meat, so this is pretty much his review. He found this dish fantastic, and usually he doesn't give 5 stars that easy. Anyway, I omitted the celery because I didn't have any, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly as is. I want to try this dish with chicken next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't expect the hubby to give as much praise as he did over this recipe; he isn't usually excited about casseroles.  The changes I made were to use mushrooms in-place of the peppers and I mixed in about 2T of flour into the meat mixture to thicken it up a bit. :)

This recipe is awesome! I have already recommended it to friends and family. I hate when someone changes the recipe extensively and then rates it lower. The first time I made this, I made it exactly as listed, except for the hot pepper (which my family doesn't like) and it was excellent. My husband and picky kids ate all of it and raved. The second time I made a few adjustments to better suit our family - I peeled and cubed the potatoes and added quite a few more, as well as adding them to the veggies in the skillet. I lessened the amount of pepper, as well as omitting the red pepper again, but that was about it. Be sure to use a good dash of the cinnamon and cloves - it does make a big difference and you will thank yourself for it when you take the first bite!! This dish is so yummy and as been added to my weekly dinner rotation, due to the frequent begging I get to make this dish!! Thanks!!

This is an interesting recipe.  Kind of like a Moussaka without the eggplant.  I really enjoyed making it and it was very tasty.  Thank you for haring it.  (I will make this again and possibly add a little tomato paste)

Made this with veggie crumbles and was FANTASTIC. I felt the meat/veggie mixture was a bit dry without the beef juices so I added a splash more each of water, wine, and half and half. Needed to cook for about 55 minutes to get the potatoes soft. Turned out AMAZING. Loved the flavors.

This was just okay. We really weren't that crazy about it, but it was something different. I did up all the spices and omitted the red wine (didn't have any), used milk instead of half & half and added a tad of tomato paste for flavor. It was just okay. Not bad, but not good. Definetly need to add some liquid to the dish...mine kind of dried out and i had to add the water (maybe by beef was too lean ??-93/7). Anyways, just average in my opinion, but could see how some would like it.

Our absolute favorite dish!  We make this at least once a week with few, if any, leftovers.  The only thing that makes it better is red pepper rather than green.

We loved this dish! Wasn't sure about the cinnamon/clove addition, but it is a great flavor in this dish. The only changes I made were to add 2 crushed cloves of garlic & to increase the liquid a bit. Otherwise as written. Nicely spicy.  Next time I may uncover for the last half of cooking to brown the top a bit. My husband asked that we make it again soon! Thank you amanda!

This was not that great. It was not bad - but I will not be making it again. The potatoes on top an bottom were very bland and I didn't think the cinnamin went well with the flavors at all.

This was very tasty.  The only thing I did different was add fresh garlic.  I did not think it was too spicy at all.  I will get ground beef with less fat in it next time though.

Wow! Was this delish!!! I added 1 more sliced potato to the layers and 1 more chopped to the veggie mixture. I sprinkled garlic powder and black pepper on the top of the casserole. I did'nt have the cream so I used 2T.milk and 1T. flour (mixed together first). It was a bit peppery but we like it that way...if you don't...maybe try 1/2 the black pepper. Also didn't have the wine so I used all water but dissolved the bouilion in it first in the microwave. Really can't wait to have this again!!! Hubby even had seconds!

Interesting mix of flavors.  I also used double the potatoes, and added a bit more cinnamon and cloves than called for.  It reminded me of a similar dish (don't remember the name...) which has raisins, so I added them as well, which added to the spicy/sweet flavor.

This is a very unique recipe. I almost didn't try it since I wasn't sure if my family would be up for something so different.  They loved it!  I added a little garlic just because I love it and it was very good.

5 stars without the cinnamon or cloves and you have to at least double the amount of potato or you will have a ton of meat.  I will triple it next time.  The wine gave it very good flavor.

I made this recipe for a pot luck at work and people were demanding the recipe.  It was gone in an instant and people were bragging about having gotten to eat some.  I didn't change anything at all with the recipe either.  It is perfect as is.

this was absolutely wonderful!  I accidently added double the wine so i let it reduce and added another 1/4 cup of water.  It came out so good, my 5 year old loved it!  I would like to try to put it as a filling for a meat pie or tarts for the holidays.  I can't wait to share thi with my extended family!  Thanks so much!!!

My mixture was really dry, I used lean ground beef so once it was browned there really wasn't any grease left if the pan and after the addition of all the veg and spices the water and wine and a couple spoonfuls of cream did not make enough gravy, the mixture was still just dry so I had to add about 1/2 cup of sour cream as that was all I had on hand, also had to dot the topping of potato's with a bit of butter.  It turned out not bad, I will probably make it again but will also cut down the black pepper and just add a few more red pepper flakes as I like them better, I would also add some garlic.

Delightfully different, yet it looks so "ordinary".  Our two teenagers and my husband and I loved it.  Ours cooked in about 35 minutes.  We will make this again.  Only change was we used whipping cream instead of half/half.

This was surprisingly good. I (like the others) was worried about the spice combo but it turned out great. I didn't have any issues with the amount of starch it seems to be just enough. I used 3 small/medium potatoes. I also added more crushed red pepper (we love spicy foods). I don't keep red wine in my pantry for cooking but added red wine vinegar and it tasted just fine. I also had some frozen green, yellow and red pepper mix so i added about a cup or so of that to the recipe. Very good and will definitely make again!

I haven't rated much on this website, but I felt I had to say how good this one was.  I know a recipe is good when I look forward to coming home the next day to eat the leftovers. I used ground red pepper and it came out a little spicy, which I love. Yummy stuff!

I really liked this but my family wasn't too keen on the cinnamon/clove flavour of the casserole. Might be an aquired taste.

This recipe was PERFECT for a rainy night in.  It warms you from the inside out.  I changed a few things based on my taste and what was available - I added cubed potatoes to the veggie mixture, and all potatoes I used were unpeeled, red skinned.  They worked beautifully.  I also used 1/4 to 1/2 cup beef broth instead of the bouillon cube (I didn't have a lot of liquid in my pan and was afraid it wouldn't dissolve) and fat-free half-and-half.  I also sprinkled the top layer of potatoes with paprika, salt and pepper.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I love to try ethnic foods and this was definately a treat. This was awesome for me but even without the addition of the ground red pepper was too spicy for the rest of my family. I added garlic and omited to green peppers but other then that stuck to the directions. I used my mandolin to ge thin uniform potato slices. I will make this regularly.

Wow. This was absolutely delicious. Amazing what pinches of cinnamon and cloves can do. I used Hungarian Sweet Paprika instead of the usual bland variety. I added an additional potato, per other suggestions. Next time I might add a little more liquid, because  the little bit of "gravy" I got this time was wonderful. I agree with LGHANSEN that cubing the potatoes would probably work with this, too.

I used a lb. of red potatoes sliced (but not peeled). I thought it was very good, but the potatoes didn't look very appetizing, and they didn't have much taste. The meat mixture was super tasty. Next time I would just cube the potatoes and mix them in with the meat.

Okay, I'll be honest I didn't like this dish at all but the same honesty means it deserves the 4 stars. It tasted good (just a bit too different), it was spicy (too spicy for me) and it was easy to make without lots of costly or unusual ingredients. The only reason I won't give it 5 is because of my own preferneces, my Dad and brother loved it. My husband didn't mind it. I was okay with it other than it was too spicy. Unfortunately, it was a failure with my mother and daughters.

This is a great recipe.  It is easy and versatile and uses ingredients that are generally on hand. It also doesn't dirty every dish in the cupboard. The flavour combination is superb and intense.  Just the small bit of cream adds a perfect richness.  
This one definately goes into my dinner rotation.  Thanks.

This dish was wonderful! Spicy, but Ohhh so good. I made a few changes, no half & half so I added cream of celery soup, and I didnt have celery so I omited them, & doubled the carotts. I also used 1/2lb of ground beef, and used an extra potato and added a SWEET POTATO. Very Tasty will make again and again!!!

This dish was a puzzler for us...at first we thought it was a bit odd (as we are not used to the spice combination), but it definitely grew on us.  We ate the leftovers happily for dinner the next night and thought it improved upon sitting.  Don't think I will add it to my normal rotation, but would make again for something out of the ordinary.  I always love new and different dishes.

WOW!! This was so delicious! I had some ground beef and was hoping to find something different to do with it and found this recipe! How tasty!! I had no green pepper so I used a red one.  I also added Garlic because I add it to everything =) Both seemed good additions.  Very tasty, easy and fun to make.  The whole house smells great!! And I agree.. perfect with a nice glass of red wine.. 
I made extra on purpose as I suspected it would be very tasty!! now i can't wait for lunch!!! The cloves and cinnamon really add a nice comfort.. 
5 Stars!!! GREAT recipe!!

This was so good! My husband and our 2 sons weren't so sure about this one when I told them the spices I was using, but one taste and they were hooked. I used only celery and onions, since that was what I had on hand. I sauteed the meat with the veggies, then added the spices (used 1/4 t. cinnamon and 1/8 t. cloves) along with 1/2 can of low-fat cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream. I used about 6 potatoes and it didn't seem like too many at all. Definitely cover with foil... I baked it at 375 for one hr. Delicious!

Not impressed.  May work better as a stuffing for something but a little strange alone.  We did eat the whole thing though.

My family loved this! I drained the ground beef and did not add the olive oil. I used two carrots because I was out of green pepper. I noticed it was quite dry before I put it in the casserole, so I added enough sour cream to make it moist enough to bake  without drying out. I used about six smaller potatoes. The crispy potatoes combined with the creamy filling was delicious!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. We were pleasantly surprised that it was a quite spicy (hot) when only 1/4 tsp crushed peppers was used. This recipe is sure to be a keeper in my house. Very easy to make and very tasty. My father in law has similar dish that he makes and he calls it Moussaka. He's from Bosnia.

The spice blend had a great balance and really made the recipe.  I'm going out to buy a bigger covered cassarole dish so I can fit one more sliced potato into the recipe.  Yummy!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!! This dish is fantastic, super easy to make and it tastes like a dream. I made it a couple nights ago and plan on making it again tomorrow. After I made it I emailed the recipe to everyone I could and told them they just had to try it. What a great meal! Thanks Amanda

This has a delightful scent while cooking and what a treat to the taste buds also.  Will do again but will add more potatoes.  Thanks for posting.

This is a wonderful recipe.  My family loved it.  One must always remember that you must taste while your cooking (Chef Ramsey from H***'* Kitchen states this all the time.)  I have not used cinnamin nor cloves very much in cooking, therefore, adding to YOUR taste as you go with these will satisfy your palate.  I didn't use the peppers because I didn't have any.  Since it's referred to and compared with a "Sheperd's Pie" I added some mixed vegetables.  Also, the crushed red peppers get hotter as they bake in the mixture in the oven and get hotter, so be careful.  I also substituted beef boullon with campbell's golden mushroom soup and a can of french onion soup so that it wouldn't be dry as others stated.  I did use a half of package of onion soup mix in the hamburger mixture for extra flavoring.  What a different flavor; I'm tired of eating the same old things all the time.  Thanks for sharing this "Serbian" recipe!  Oh yeah, my 11 year old son said it smelled very good and was it ready.  He sat down and said "I smell cinnamon" and my husband said, "No" and I said "Yes".  This was a wonderful experiment.  Thanks again!  It's already in my recipe box!

I had to do some substitutions (milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, nutmeg instead of cloves, Onion soup mix instead of beef boullion, and no red wine) but it turned out really good! My boyfiend came home late and started eating it cold because he said it smelled so good! I will definately make this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

My Husband and I thought this was Excellent!  I did not have the beef Bullion Cube, so I used half a packet of Brown Gravy mix, and upped the Red Win to 1/4 cup.  I also put a layer of Mozzarella Cheese over the top of the beef, then the Potatoes, then another layer of Cheese on top of the whole bake. This was fantastic!  The Cinnamon was a delightful flavor that brought everything together.  Definitely will make this one again! (Great served with Corn as Side dish.)

I liked this alot.  It was different from the usual, which is what I wanted.  It was too spicy for DH, though, but I'd make it again for myself.

Fabulous, easy meal. Great spices. I omitted the green pepper, as I don't care for it, but this was still fabulous. Used Hungarian Paprika, which provided a little more depth. My British husband was a bit skeptical about what I'd described as "an Eastern European version of Shepherd's Pie," but we were both won over. One warning, this is supposed to serve 4. We're not normally big eaters, but we liked it so much, the two of us ate it all!

My family and I loved this recipe! I had to make a couple of changes due to my lack of ingredients. I left out the bell pepper, red pepper, cloves and wine. I added 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder, increased the water to 1/2 cup, increased the cinnamon to 1/4 teaspoon, and increased the half and half cream to 1/4 cup. I will be making this recipe often. Goes great with plain basmati rice.

I loved the taste of this, but it was a bit on the greasy side - I would definitely reduce the grease by not using the reserved juice and coming up with another liquid - but everything else about it was very good.

My boyfriend liked this dish and the seasoning was great.  This is a nice way to get a guy to eat veges if he's not normally a vege eater.  Personally though, it wasn't one of my favorite recipes.  If my boyfriend requests it again, I'll make it, but with another dish for me to enjoy.

The flavors here are incredible. I was a little skeptical because it didn't seem like there was tons of seasonings, but I made it almost exactly to the letter and there was no lack of flavor! I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand--I had some fancy vegetable bullion cubes, so I used those instead of beef bullion, and I also didn't have half and half and subbed milk and a pat of butter. I also dotted the top with butter and sprinkled with some extra paprika.

One thing that went wrong was that I think 45 minutes at 400 degrees is too much. My potatoes were very dark brown and there was practically no liquid left in the dish. Next time I will lower the temperature and check in on it at 30 minutes. 

In spite of that, this dish was a big hit and I will be making it again.

This exceeded my expectations.  Thanks to the reviewers from that area who gave suggestions (Vegeta).  I made the recipe exactly as written, though like many reviewers I added a few more potato slices.  The flavors were wonderful, but next time I make it I will use more spice because it just wasn’t seasoned quite enough for me.  The family was “meh” about it initially, but the more they ate, the more they liked it.  I’m sure the leftovers today will be even better. I’ll definitely make again.

I’ve made this twice now. The flavors are really good as is. I double the recipe and double the spices, and layer it in a deep square casserole dish that’s about 12”x12”x5” with a lid. 3 thick layers of meat filling and 4 layers of chopped yellow potatoes (about .5” to .75” cubes), kind of like lasagna. Start with a potato layer and end with a potato layer. I don’t add the dairy, just a little extra bullion broth. Sprinkle with a little dried parsley for a little green. Cover and bake for 45 minutes. I serve with sour cream on the side because we have dairy restrictions in my household and it bakes up well without the cream. Really yummy.

Good, not great. I didn't add egg or potato. My husband did like it so I would make it again. I speeded up the whole process by browning meat in one pan and in another pan I cooked the onion then veggies.  Then I combined it all, added the spices, liquids and baked it.

Loved this. Be warned...it is spicy and probably not something that will be enjoyed by small kids. We loved it just as it was. Like others I omitted the olive oil and used the fat from the ground beef. I did everything else as described. Hubby and I both said that this will become a regular at our house.

It said to use lean ground beef and we just happened to have ground buffalo meat. We never do. We had two pounds so I doubled the recipe and followed the recipe exactly except for adding a small layer of parmesan cheese before adding the top layer of thinly slice potatoes. Excellent recipe. We will do again. Thank you.

Good dish.  Reminded me of pastitsio without the bechamel sauce. Agree with other reviewers, meat to potatoes ratio was a bit off, but did leave extra meat  for another dish.  Cinnamon and cloves definitely make the dish, but don’t overdo them.  They could quickly overpower the dish.  Would make it again.

This is a go-to recipe. I easily fix it 2-3 times a month. I love the sliced potatoes but sometimes I'll give it the shepherd's pie treatment with mashed potatoes on top. A real favorite!!

I used reviewers' suggestions to make slight changes. I used a bag of Southern Style Hash Browns (small cubes) to simplify my preparation. I mixed those with about 3 T of melted butter and some pepper and salt for a little flavor.  I baked the dish 45 mins and then poured 6 beaten eggs with a little milk over the top and baked for another 15 mins (uncovered this time). The potatoes were light and fluffy and the dish was pretty good. I might adjust the seasonings a little for our personal taste, but we like it enough to have it again.

Yikes ... we had to throw it away. Don't know if boiling the potatoes was a left-out step, but this was all-hands-down THE WORST thing I've ever made following a recipe ... Yikes

Will make again but with some changes.  We found it too dry, needs more moisture and potatoes on top needed something.  I sprinkled them with a bit of paprika, S&P for color and flavor, and ended with a light mist of cooking spray. The pepper and red pepper and it over  powered the other flavors.  Next time I will cut way back on the pepper and a bit of the red pepper.  Add double or triple all the liquids.

Followed the recipe as written, except for another layer of potatoes .  I was hesitant on the ground clove. I do not like clove at all. But reading the other reviews they said to get over it and put it in anyway. I did and I don't regret it! An awesome dish. Will definitely make again!

Just OK.  Not a fan of cloves and cinnamon with beef.  The potatoes needed to be seasoned as well.  Will not be making again.

I skipped the cinnamon and cloves, which I realize are what makes it a Serbian dish, but I didn't think that would fly with my conventional eaters. I substituted garlic and more of an Italian mix of seasonings, kept the red wine, and they really liked it.  I'm giving it a 5 because it's such a good basic recipe that it can be adapted to different tastes, and because it was a bit hit with my family.

Very good but needs more spices than it calls for.  We didn't add the half and half but did add extra veggies (peas and corn) to make it healthier.

My family really liked it. I added an extra layer of potatoes and put eggs on top like another person suggested. It was good with or without the eggs. I was worried about the meat mixture being too dry. It wasn't too dry, but I would have liked a little bit of sauce with it. This would make a great breakfast dish.

I used 1 cup rice (basmati) instead of potatoes and layered it like the recipe suggested but the top layer was meat. I incorporated 2 cups of combined apple juice( I was out of wine) and beef broth. It was fantastic! Cooked for suggested time with vented foil covering dish.

Quick easy real ingredients that are likely on hand. I cut back the pepper and when I make it again will cut back even more as it was very peppery, a little too much for my husbands sensitive palate.  Definitely saving this recipe.

Turned out great! Added a few layers of cheese to the top of the potatoes, because my house thinks everything is better with cheese. Next time, I’ll add a layer of potatoes in the middle too! Hubbie wants me to add jalapeños too! It’s definitely going to be made again!

I used more than 2 potatoes, enough to completely cover bottom layer and top layer.  Dotted top of potatoes with butter and sprinkled with salt & pepper before covering with foil.  To brown potatoes I broiled for 5 min at the end, uncovered.  I will drain off fat from hamburger next time as it was a bit greasy for our taste.  Overall it is delicious and everyone really liked it.

I made this tonight and we loved it. There was a lot of flavor. I didn't have the ground clove or wine. Next time I will be sure I have the wine. I did have 3 layers of potatoes with the meat mixture between. I also added some salt and pepper to each of the potato layers.

My husband and daughter both wanted seconds and she doesn't even love meat or potatoes! I just wish there was a little more substance to it, something to make it last longer. I used soy milk instead of half and half. Who needs something so unhealthy? We never missed it.

Except for using 1/2 the crushed red pepper, I made it per the recipe.  I plan to reduce or cut out the salt next time .  It didn't taste too salty but I'm always looking to cut out salt where I can.  And with the bouillon, I don't think it will suffer with less salt added.

I make this all the time, the only thing I do different is leave out the green pepper since we don't like it. It's a huge family favorite, even my granddaughters who and 6 and 2 love it!! I shred my carrots and put a lot of them in along with a lot of celery so it has a full serving of veggies

made exactly as instructed.....well, OK fine, I used 1/2 cup of wine.   it is really deliciously as is. I would change a couple of minor things.  1) I'd use more potatoes. I'd guess about 4 russets or 2 Large potatoes. enough to properly layer.  And I'd leave uncovered for part of the end of baking time to get some color on the taters.  The 4 serving version was enough for 3 people served as a one dish meal (but maybe with that extra potato it would have been good for 4).   the flavors are wonderful.

Made this for a big family dinner. I doubled the recipe and was a tiny bit more liberal with the wine and paprika. I I followed a reviewer's suggestion and bought some seasoning/spice  mix from a Croatian company called Vegeta, and added this to the beef.  The meal was really, really good and  my family loved it! 100% going to make this again.

i made it pretty much as written, except i used a container of greek yogurt instead of half and half.  little bit of balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  and  a mix called Seven Spice, which has all the necessary spices in it.  added 3 cloves of garlic to the veggie mix.  at the end i put it under the broiler to add some color to the potatoes on top.    i used a 8x8 inch baking dish and did it in three layers instead of two.  topped each serving with some more greek yogurt.  my middle eastern husband said it was delicious and that is all that counts.  the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because there is a lot of chopping involved and i am lazy and dont like to do all that.  but it is a keeper and i will make it again.

Tasty dish. I did three potato layers as someone suggested in the comments and feel this was a good thing.  Forgot paprika which may have entirely changed the dish (oops).  I did not have green peppers but substituted poblano, which gave a wonderful subtle spicy flavor.  I will probably double the whole thing and layer yet another level of meat and potatoes, since this 13x9 dish barely fed three at our house, considering the second helpings and all. This was entirely outside my usual range of spices and I loved it! Applesauce seemed the perfect companion.

I don't normally like spiced meat like this, but I'm a half addicted to this recipe.  I'm going to have to add it to my arsenal of recipes.

This turned out fantastic!  I didn't add the peppers, simply because  my husband doesn't like them.  I also didn't have cream or bullion, so used condensed milk and nothing for the bullion.  ;)  Still...absolutely delicious.  Keeper.

This was phenomenal!!  The only ingredient I did not have on hand was celery, but  it still tasted delicious w/out it.    I used ½ cup of half-n-half b/c I didn't want a dry finish, and that turned out really well.  Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe!  It is now a permanent addition to my recipe repertoire.

I made this strictly from the recipe... horrible.  I made this for 8 people, 2 of which are like garbage disposals who will eat anything, and not one person could stand to eat it.  o_O Also, my dog refused it as well.

2017:  Looking for something different one night.  Very Good!Doubled meat and seasoning. Sprinkled Tony's on meat while cooking.  Cut up potatoes & drizzled olive oil and all seasoning on them before layering.  Added 2T Worcestershire, 1 can of peas. Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of potatoes.  Used 1 t celery salt instead of celery.  1/8 t cayenne, 1/2 c water, 1/4 c red wine, chicken bouillon-no beef, 4T half & half, 8 potatoes.

So good! I would cook it uncovered for part of the time just to make the sauce thicker, but hubby wanted more sauce so it was like soup. Either way, we will definitely make it again.

Added the extra potatoes, but did not increase my seasoning so it came out a little bland. We'll try again with more seasoning and dicing the potatoes instead of slicing

Not sure how it is going to come out. It is in the oven. I used sweet potatoes and ground turkey and beef broth instead of the bullion and water. Also fudged on the cinnamon and cloves because no cloves on hand but used allspice. Am sure it will be tasty.

This turned out to be something special -- though I did follow some of the suggestions offered by other readers. Many thanks,  y'all!  I added an extra layer of potatoes (and I microwaved the sliced potatoes for about 3.5 minutes before layering them -- I was glad I did; it made for tender, well-cooked inner potato layers.  I also appreciated the suggestion to lightly season the layers. ) I added the minced garlic, as someone else suggested, but I substituted some chopped fresh broccoli that I had on hand for the green bell peppers which my family just doesn't care for.  My own "tweak" was to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the mix, rather than the half and half, which I didn't have on hand. It made a nice sauce -- not traditional, I know, but very flavorful. (Next time, I'll be good and use the half and half.)  I drizzled a little olive oil over the top layer before baking -- but, I think I'll try the beaten eggs drizzled over the top that one reader advised.  (The top layer of potatoes came out a little too tough, even with the olive oil. It needs "something." to soften the texture a bit. Perhaps the eggs will do the trick.) However, the meat-vegetable filling is the real star of this dish.  There is a wonderful balance of spices -- and the aroma when cooking is out of this world..  4 stars as written, and a full 5 with a few little adjustments.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My fiance loved this. I didn't have any red wine so I just left it out and still had great flavor. was easy and quick. Like others suggested i used more potatoes  which gave me a bottom, middle, and top layer.

The mix of flavors was wonderful - a little bit of spice with a hint of cinnamon. Very different and yummy. Ground beef was a little dry, as were the potatoes on top. We are going to try it again with bacon and shrimp instead of beef.

This is an excellent dish! The only change I made was to double the amount of potatoes and cube them, then add them to the mixture. The spice mixture was fantastic!

I added twice as many potatoes and twice as much wine. I like it a little more saucy than what the recipe seemed it would be. I layered the potatoes and meat, like others suggested. Potatoes on bottom, layer of meat, potatoes in middle, layer of meat, potatoes on top. I also added about 1/3 cup of chicken broth to the casserole dish while it cooked. Will make again!

I was looking for a new way to prepare ground beef, and I found this recipe. I though, what the heck, seems kind of plain but I'll try it. It is absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as it, except I added a clove of minced garlic and some mushrooms, and a layer of potatoes in the middle as other reviewers suggested.  The blend of spices was perfect, the potatoes were tender, it was all perfectly balanced meat/potatoes.  My boyfriend ate half the casserole in one sitting and told me to add it to our favourite recipes list for regular repeats.  :)

This dish was great, I loved the flavors. I made this recipe as it is written other than adding extra sliced potatoes for layers. This was even better the next day. I love the fact that it is a ground beef recipe that does not include pasta, canned soup or an alarming amount of cheese. The only thing I would do differently would to completely  drain the beef and use olive oil  to saute with, I felt that there was enough juices left in the skillet  after browning the meat  and never added the olive oil but after it was baked, it is my opinion that there was still a little too much grease in the dish. I still love the dish and will make it again - Thank You!

When I made this I thought "I'll try it, sounds like a good base for something." No, it's THE something!! So good! My 9 year old said "WHY HAVENT YOU MADE THIS BEFORE?!?" At the suggestion of another reviewer, I cut half a potato into cubes and added it to the veggies before I sautéed them. They absorbed a lot of flavor and I will continue to do that every time!! I used heavy cream instead of half and half because it's what I had. So good. Quite spicy. I'll make on the regular from now on!!! Yum!!!!

I'm always looking to add variety to my ground beef idea collection. This was a good find. It wasn't a perfect 10  mind blower but a good variation to use once in a while. I was  skeptical but even the kids ate it (4 and 7).  I up'd the potato content a bit. I also did it more scallop potato style and that worked great.

Excellent flavor, and a great casserole to make for my son who can't stand the texture of any type of noodle ( including lasagna)' no matter how al dente.

I made this to use up what I had in the fridge. I have to admit I was skeptical of the cinnamon and cloves, but I made it exactly as written and we loved it!  It really worked--YUM!

Took the advice of one of the other reviewers to add a middle layer of potatoes and to season them (again, as advised, I used paprika, parsley, salt and pepper)  I also omitted the celery, because I hate it.  Very tasty, I liked the delicate seasoning.  Will make again.

My whole family loved this. Everyone went back for seconds! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and made three layers of potatoes so I went through a few more than two that the recipe called for. I also added cheese on the top after it finished cooking and just recovered it back up to melt it and I think it made a huge difference!

Loved this! Used what I had (ground bison and turnips instead of potatoes) and added left over broccoli, cauliflower and chopped asparagus. I used Penzey's Tsardust Memories (Russian seasoning mix). There were no leftovers!

This was an interesting recipe "starter" for me.  I  have the bad habit of not making sure I have all the ingredients for recipes before starting (ha ha).  So this is what I did: No carrots as they just don't seem to last in my home. Ran out of celery, again another home favorite. But I did have celeriac, aka celery root. Many people find this root veggie "scary looking" and don't get adventurous. I used a saute pan and put in the  celeriac with the olive oil. Put cover on cooked for about 5 mins, then added the green pepper. Put the cover back on until the Celeriac is slightly browned. Lastly added onions. Cooked until they were translucent. Followed the rest of directions. I used yukon and blue potatoes. As others have said, the upper potatoes are a tid bland. I would add salt, I use Himalayan Pink salt, very sparsely. The other issue is, the meat can get dry and crumbly. Not sure what to use for a "binder" that won't interfere with the awesome flavors. So my suggestion is to cover the pan while baking with aluminum foil to counteract dryness.






                                                                 ROUND 2 UPDATE. I made some changes and this came about amazing. I doubled the carrots. This time I sliced the potatoes very thin. I put the 1st row in an 8x8 pan. I did a very light drizzle of olive oil. a little salt. Put 1/2 the meat mix then topped with another layer of potatoes. Olive oil and salt, then put the last 1/2 meat in. Topped with another layer of po

This was fine. Didn't really care for the spice mix but it definitely different and gets you out of the same old same old routine. On note to make, use the leanest beef you can find. 7% would be good. I didn't and this has enough fat in it that it overwhelms the food and puddles after cooking.

I've made this dish a few times.  I took the advice of the former Yugoslavian and used more potatoes and layered the potatoes.  I usually turn the broiler on to brown the potatoes on top when the dish is ready.  I'm actually thinking of adding some cheese to it, as well.  The unique flavor of the spices in the ground beef is absolutely delicious.

Very tasty. If you don't handle spicy well, ease up on the red pepper flakes some. I was out of red wine, so I used chicken broth in place of the water and red wine. I would also double the potato layers on both ends. Enjoy.

As usual, I tweaked the recipe a bit~ We did not have green pepper, so I omitted it. We added mix frozen veggies instead. We substituted beef broth for the water & beef bullion. We did not have half & half, so I used liquid/non whipped whipping cream. We also doubled the recipe for family size & instead of doing the recommended number of potatoes did one per family member.

This is really delicious and my family loves it. After making it a few times, I have made a few alterations to suit our preferences. I found the original a little dry, so I double all of the liquid ingredients. I replaced the water with beef stock and skipped the bouillon. I increased the beef to 1.5 lbs and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to it while it is cooking. I use two large baking potatoes which I do not peel and create an extra layer of potatoes in the middle. The leftovers (if you have any!) are fabulous with an over-easy egg on top for breakfast.

tried this recipe and it was a hit in the house. I would make it again and again. I will try with eggplant too so that it could be called moussaka with a lot of veggies mixed in. Extra veggies are always important in our home and all in one dish even better. I probably double all veggies requested and eliminated  1/2 & 1/2 (none in the house) and used available white wine instead.

Made this last week, and wow what a terrific and filling meal. I used very lean beef. I added the water but didn't use the bullion because I didn't have any. We will definitely keep this recipe as a favorite. Yummy!  Washing up was a breeze since everything is initial prepared in a single skillet, and the casserole dish was quick to wash too.

We just didn't care for this at all.  Made as directed except did the 3 layers as so many others suggested.  Used mandolin to slice potatoes at 1/8" and some of them still weren't cooked completely thru.  Did not care at all for the cinnamon & cloves in the meat (so sorry).  I would like to try this again, only without the cinn/cloves and using mashed potatoes instead of sliced.  My apologies, but just not for us.

This dish is perfect on a fall evening.  Regardless of your native palate this is a classic comfort food, an exotic yet familiar menagerie of spices that leaves your soul satisfied.  I recommend doubling the spices, adding garlic powder.  Adding 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and cloves really kicks up the exotic factor.   adding the meat back in with the veggies toss in a couple TB of flour, as it will thicken the juices and keep the meat tender while it bakes uncovered

This was great, was looking for something to do with some ground beef I had and tried this out.   

As someone said- don't leave out the pinches of cloves and cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of sweet type spices in my meat, but it adds a lot to this recipe, and the pepper flakes I went a hair heavy on and it complements the spice it added.   As other commenters suggested, I did three layers of potatoes and spiced the potatoes, I added salt/pepper/garlic powder/paprika to them.  

I didn't expect much and was very pleasantly surprised by this.

This dish looked simple, and I wasn't expecting it would be very spectacular, but the flavors are amazing! Leftovers went very fast and the family requested that I make it again.

I changed it around a bit by substituting mushrooms in for green peppers, sweet potatoes in for regular potatoes and Tony Chachere's in for Paprika because, let's be honest, you could put that stuff on anything. It was very good but I think, if you substituted mashed potatoes in for sliced potatoes, it would make a killer shepherd's pie.

I followed this recipe somewhat with the exception of not adding the crushed red pepper and reduced the paprika by half. I didn't have red wine so I used cranberry juice instead. My husband is very picky and so is my 4 year old. This was delicious!The flavor is so tasty! I am definately making this again!

It's hard to find a new recipe that works well with my son's food allergies as he is sensitive to many spices as well as egg, soy, and possibly dairy.  I put an additional layer of potatoes in the middle as recommended, and dropped out the half and half (due to the allergies).  It was really good!  Everyone in the family liked it.

Fantastic!  I would not change this recipe either- use the extra large potatoes for more coverage on top of meat.  Unlike other reviewers, I do not think you need an extra starch (maybe try a baguette?) but this is really good served with a salad.  I used a basic vinaigrette and it complemented the spices well.

This is a great way to shake up the weekly food routine.

Very tasty and my boyfriend loved it!  I used Nature's Seasonings on the ground beef.  Add veggies to beef to cook and skipped olive oil.  Used milk instead of cream.  Added salt, pepper, paprika and parsley to top layer. Forgot to peel potatoes and did one layer on top and bottom only without one the middle....and it still got rave reviews.  Smelled delicious while cooking.  For some this may be a meatier dish than they like but it was perfect for us.

I discovered this recipe several years ago and have been making it ever since. I make it about once a week now. It is truly wonderful. I use a mandolin to slice the potatoes, which saves tons of time. It's actually not at all labor intensive, though guests are always impressed by the way it looks. Not to mention its flavor... :-D

Decided to make it as a one skillet meal.  Ended up using about 1/4 t of both cinnamon and cloves.  Didn't really taste a "pinch" before.  Cut way back on ground peppers, as I'm a pansy.  Probably used closer to 3/4 c liquid - 1/2 water, 1/2 wine.  Cubed 4 small red potatoes and cooked it all together.  No layering and no hot oven.  Nice taste.

Made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  It has a little (tiny) kick that adds great flavor, but if you have kids that can't take any heat, you may want to scale down or omit the crushed red pepper.

Very flavorful. Made a lot of substitutions, and it was still delicious. I don't eat red meat so used ground turkey. Boyfriend doesn't like green peppers so used a red pepper.  Used non-fat milk instead of half and half. And didn't like the way my potato looked, so used a sweet potato!  Will make again for sure.

After eating the same thing night after night, I came across this and gave it a shot. It was fantastic. I ditched the celery and went with a red pepper instead and added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of half and half, since my ground beef was 93/7. We will definitely be making this again!

An excellent meal. Serve it with pitas or naan bread. I think the next time I make it I would like to try a pinch of cardamon and lower the black pepper by a 1/4 teaspoon.

We enjoyed this spicy international meal tonight.  I added a middle layer of potatoes to offset the "too much meat" problem.  I also sprinkled more paprika onto the potatoes....spicy and good!  Unfortunately, I was out of green pepper, but it tasted great anyway.  We had steamed green beans to balance out the meal.

I love this recipe. A little on the spicy side so if you're making for kids I'd cut back on the heat. Otherwise delicious. The only change I make was not adding clove (I didn't have any) and also didn't have any beef bouillon cubes so I used half a packet of beef flavor from ramon noodles. Mine turned out really good. Also I'm not sure if I sliced my potatoes thinner than most but mine only needed 30 min to bake before the potatoes were tender. Overall delicious and I'll be making it again.

I found this recipe today & cooked it for dinner. I had most of the ingredients on hand. I substituted milk for cream, and left out the beef bullion cube since I was out. I did not add the olive oil since I thought the ground beef drippings would do the trick. We loved this recipe. It was so tasty! I will fix this again. I think next time since it is very crumbly, I will line muffin tins with loaf bread, toast the bread & add this mixture to them. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Very good and satisfying. It's a different version of  the traditional Shepard 's pie. I made some brown rice to go with it.

My family and I enjoyed this main dish but it didn't have that "Wow!" factor to warrant a 5 star rating.  
My husband would agree with other reviews that there should be more potatoes added to the dish.  He was also of the opinion that this could be made entirely in the covered frying pan rather than baking to save some time/energy -- I followed the recipe and was happy with those results.  I used just a "pinch" of both ground cinnamon and cloves which seemed to be about the right amount for my family (who aren't really keen on these flavours in meats or main dish sauces). So, I would not be inclined to increase the quantity of cloves, as suggested by some reviewers.
Still, a great combination of flavours and a well rounded main dish. Great recipe for an experiment based on verbal descriptions.

This is a nice change of pace. I used 3 russet potatoes and layered them, as another reviewer suggested, potato/meat mixture/potato/meat/potato. Then I topped the potato layer with about a Tbs of butter pats and Parmesan cheese. I also used the allspice as suggested. Quite good. And the 2 year old and 5 year old ate it right up.

This was good, really good, but next time i'm changing it to reduce the black pepper, and add more cinnamon and nutmeg - just my own preferences.

This was really good. I substituted green beans for the bell pepper and celery. Two potatoes would not have been enough. I had to use five. My wife complained about the cinnamon so I will leave that out next time.

I was surprised that I found this a little bit boring based on the reviews here. I wasn't really impressed with it for dinner, but then discovered it would make an excellent breakfast dish, served alongside some eggs and maybe muffins. Needs a few more potatoes too.

Such an interesting combination of flavours. Everyone I have made this for has been delighted with this recipe. I cook the meat with the spices then add the vegetables, including the potatoes, leaving it in the skillet and omitting baking. It is delicious. Very memorable.

Absolutely wonderful!  The spices are unusual, but they meld with the other ingredients to create a dish that's completely warm, comforting and delicious.  I didn't change a thing (except for keeping the skins on the potatoes).  It's leaps and bounds above your average casserole.  I will make this again!

The combination of the heartiness of the beef, veggies and potatoes paired well with the spiciness of the cloves and cinnamon! My husband and I used high quality black angus beef and it was delicious! Will make again.

This is a lovely recipe. Due to the goods that were hand. I used ground venison, replaced green pepper with finely sliced green cabbage.  I added a drizzle of worcestershire and two cloves of garlic.  Delightful! I will make again and again. Thank you for the new mix of spices to explore with red meat.

OK...right off the bat, I'll tell you I didn't follow the directions.  I wanted a quick lunch.  I chopped up the potatoes (I used 4 red) and mixed them right in with the ground beef, celery, carrot, pepper and onion and sauteed.  I then added all the spices and added a little garlic powder.  I added the rest of the ingredients (had to use white wine) and let it simmer for a few minutes until the potatoes were cooked through.  I thought it was quite tasty, but the crushed red pepper flakes made it too hot for our taste.  I really like the combination of the other spices. I'll make it again as a one pot meal, but probably never bother making it as a casserole.

Wasn't sure how to rate this one.  I thought it was good but my husband and son didn't like it at all.  It has a unique flavor with the cinnamon and cloves.  I noticed in the other reviews people either love it or hate it and that's what happened in our house.

My Serbian boyfriend enjoyed this receipe. But next time I would not put any potatoes on the bottom of the casserole as they stuck to the bottom.  I would either put all the potatoes on top, or even cut them up and bake them in with the ground beef.  But the spices and vegetables were perfect!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this dish twice now and both times it's been delicious.  Both times I left out the half-and-half.  The second time I added more potatoes.  Yum!  I also use ground turkey instead of ground beef, but still tastes wonderful.  I also have swapped the veggies for whatever I have around.  It's great with broccoli too!

This was not my favorite.  Other than adding 2 more potatoes (which it really needed) I followed the recipe.  It seemed kinda greasy.  We were all able to eat it just fine, but I will not be making it again.

Yeah, this just wasn't the thing for us. My husband put this firmly on the no thanks list. It was very bland and I doubled all the seasonings. I also added 2 more potatoes and it was still not enough. I actually liked it, but definitely not enough to make again. The only things I didn't do was use wine as I didn't have any (used beef broth instead) and left out the carrot. Cannot see how either of these would have made the recipe any more appealing. Sorry, not a fan.

Good, basic, yummy casserole. I liked the spices, but found it a bit oily. Next time I will drain the meat better and use less oil than it calls for.

This is very, very good!  I used low sodium beef base instead of the bouillon cube and omitted the wine because I don't cook with alcohol, but I may pick up some alcohol-free wine the next time I make this, because I think it would be even better as written.

My hubby got a second helping!  Usually when I try something new, he's not a big fan.  But this he seemed to really enjoy.  I did double the amount of potatoes and subbed beef broth for the red wine as I was out.  Otherwise, made it as stated and it was a hit.

I've never cooked with cinnamon and beef, but this was easy, economical and very tasty!  I took the suggestion of others and added two diced potatoes, and one more carrot, to the beef and veggie mix.  I also completely drained the beef after browning, then used the same pan to saute veggies.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I think steamed white rice will be better to serve along side rather than additional potatoes.  Lastly, my fiance grated Parmesan on top which sealed the deal for him.  Of course he would grate that on top of ice cream if I let him.

not sure how something can be bland and really spicy at the same time but this recipe does it.  I fixed it up with fresh grated pecorino rmano cheese at serving and it was ok then.  Would not make again, too many other good recipes out there.

Very good, there was just something that seemed a little strange, and that's why it didn't get 5 stars

While this recipe tasted fine, it just wasn't interesting at all.  It was a plain meat and potato dish and I was expecting more considering how many ingredients were in it.

I thought this was really good. I made without celery and added a diced sweet potato and diced zucchini to the meat while cooking. Also took the cover off last 5 minutes of cooking, then broiled 2 more minutes to crisp up the top potatoes. Still needed more potato, I think. Next time I may use thicker-cut potatoes for the bottom layer (mine turned to mush), and maybe layer meat and potatoes like a casserole. The flavors were great. Will definitely make again.

The flavor was different and good but I got tired of eating it halfway through. My daughter thought it was spicy.

My husband is a very bland eater, I made this when he wasn't home to see the spices.  I made only one switch, used 2 tbl. sour cream instead of half and half.  He absolutely loves and it and so do I.

This was surprisingly wonderful! I was a little hesitant because of the unique spices and not being used to cooking beef with them, but it came out great. I took the advice of some other reviewers and made it with some whole wheat egg noodles for an added starch for the meal. The potatoes in the dish just weren't enough for me. I also added a little more red pepper flakes to spice it up. I added a dollop of low-fat sour cream on top of each serving which was a nice contrast to the spicy beef. Overall, this was a great change from our usual meals, and I will definitely make again. Along with a good glass of cab, it is just perfect.

Yum!  This turned out great. Very filling!  I had already made it to the last steps when I realized I didn't have any beef bouillon, so I added a veggie one instead, and this still turned out great!  I will make this again soon!

Wow this one is a keeper.  The flavors of the cinnamon as well as the red wine and beef bouillon made this dish great.  Of course the half and half didn't hurt anything either.  It was hearty and fairly easy to make.  I plan on making it again real soon.

This was excellent, but seemed to lack *something*. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of ground cloves because I didn't have them and don't like them anyway:P. We decided that the next time we make this we'll add way more potatoes and some fajita seasoning to the meat. But for as cheap and easy as this meal was, it was sooo good! I also let it broil a bit towards the end to get nice crispy potatoes on top:). Thanks! This will be a staple in our house! I normally hate ground beef but I loved this, if that says anything:).

I tried this recipe for the meat-and-potatoes-loving men in my family and they thought it was okay, but not exceptional.  I thought the balance of seasonings was off; it might have been better with less pepper and a bit more cinnamon.  To anyone else trying this recipe, I'd advise tasting the cooked meat mixture before baking it to see if you need to adjust the seasonings (a step that I forgot).  But the recipe also needed something else for richness -- maybe some tomato paste or another tomato product.  The recipe has potential, but we didn't care much for it as is.

Our family really enjoyed this dish!  However, I made a few changes.  I used ground Lamb, a bag of fingerlings, reduced the Paprika to 1 tsp, increased the Red Wine to 1/4 Cup, no Beef cube, 1/4 tsp of both Cinnamon and Cloves, and added 2 big handfuls of pine nuts.  Yummy!

This was a good recipe , although i changed it up quite a bit . I didnt add cinnamon and cloves because i wasn't sure how my husband would like it .I also added mushrooms with the vegetables and  I didnt have red wine so i used beef broth instead and once i mixed all that up it still seemed meaty so i added a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the half and half . It did turn out really good and it was a nice base to start off and  to give me something different for dinner.

Great recipe and a nice change of pace.  I forgot to cover while cooking and the potatoes dried out a little, so don't forget to cover it!  When I noticed my mistake, I added a little butter on top of the potatoes and covered it with foil for the remainder of the time.  This added a nice flavor, so I might do it again next time even with covering it. UPDATE:  When eating this for leftovers, we crumbled Parmesan&Roasted Garlic Potato Chips (Cape Cod brand) into the mix and it was GREAT!  Probably can't be considered "Serbian" any more, but it tasted wonderful!

OMG!!! this was so good. My family loved this. We had no leftovers and everyone wanted more. I will def make this again. The cinnamon and cloves gave it an awesome ethnic taste. I did double the potatoes to even out the ratio a little but flavor was perfect!!

This recipe turned out quite nicely.  The flavor is a bit different from anything I've ever had before because of the cinnamon and cloves, but I really enjoyed it.  Like many other reviewers, I used ground turkey rather than beef, so I had to use the olive oil because the turkey didn't make enough grease.  I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have it on hand and really wanted to try this right away.  I also used five small potatoes, which I diced and mixed with the meat/vegetable mixture rather than layering.  I was afraid the cinnamon and cloves would overpower the dish, but it didn't at all; in fact, I agree with other reviewers who said it was even better the second day as leftovers.  I also shredded a tiny bit of cheddar cheese when I re-heated the leftovers, which gave it another nice kick.

Tasty!  I did enjoy it.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was concerned that it would be on the bland side, but decided to try it anyway.  I am glad I did.  Although not overly spicey, it had enjoyable flavor.  I do think that next time I might omit the ground cloves, or at least cut back a bit.

I made this for my roommates and we all loved it! I didn't have any celery or red wine around, so I just added more carrots and a little bit of red grape juice. Turned out GREAT! We also had it over rice--definitely filled out the meat to starch ratio! I can't wait to make it again.

This was excellent. I most likely would have never made this, but the photo intrigued me. The sliced potatoes looked so good. I must say the cinnamon is the key to this dish. The flavor is was different and so Serbian i guess. I had no celery but will make sure to add it next time. This is a keeper.

This couldn't have been easier to make and we had all the ingredients in our fridge and pantry. What an excellent combination of flavors! It was sweet and spicy and smelled heavenly as it baked. We loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.  As other reviewers have stated, more potatoes are a must; we will double or maybe triple them next time. Thanks for an excellent dinner!

The smell and taste of the meat mixture is definitely a 5 but I also felt like it needed more potato (I diced it really small and added it to the meat mixture)and then I felt weird just eating meat and potato without it being in a pita or maybe served over rice?  Another thought is to skip the potato slices and make mashed potatoes for it to sit upon.  In this case it would also need more gravy.

We really liked it but felt that it was missing something.  We think it is curry.  Also think it would be better with some kind of curry gravy.

Great recipe even if you're missing some of the ingredients.  I omitted the wine and celery because I had none on hand and it was still very tasty served over rice.  I made this with ground turkey instead of beef and cubed the potatoes. The cinnamon and clove spices are what makes the dish five star!

I really liked the combination of the spices; including the amount of red pepper... however, I added garlic and majoram while cooking the beef.  I did not have red wine so I used sherry instead, and milk instead of half-n-half.  Living now in an arid environment, I feel as though I needed a tad more liquid.
I have both a 3 and 5 year old so the red pepper is going to turn them off, so I will be adding some cheese on top of their portions to mask some of the heat.

My husband liked the combo but felt the crushed pepper could be reduced by half. We are looking forward to trying it once it has finished in the oven. Thank you for sharing.

Pretty good.  A different flavor for the typical ground beef dinner.  I have a hard time coming up with ways to use hamburger, but this was good. Will make again.

Really tasty dish! The only variations I made on the recipe was a bit less salt and pepper. I probably could have used more cinnamon and cloves too but was a little nervous about what that would add to a savory dish. It tasted great though. I also cooked the meat and drained the grease and then added the veggies to the meat rather than cooking them separately. Served it with rice like some of the reviews suggested and my husband almost preferred the rice with the meat to the potatoes. But the potatoes were good and I don't think it needed too many more of them to make the dish great on it's own. The rice did help to soak up some of the juices from the meat so you didn't loose any of the tasty goodness. :) Will make again.

Flavor was really good. I didn't give it 5 stars because it had an indentity crisis. I think if I added more potatoes it might be more like a casserole. It seemed like a stew (which was good too).

Great comfort dish...ideal for cold, winter months. Can substitute different veggies and cubed ground beef and still turns out yummy!

I thought this was really good.  I increased the potatoes as others had and eliminated the bell peppers. I think next time I'll put more beef in and double the spices.  I also used white zinfendel wine instead of a red.
