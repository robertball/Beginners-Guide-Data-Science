This was a fast meal to throw together. Loved not having to chop for a change! I had to double it and also added some chicken stock to tone down the wine flavor (maybe it depends on what kind of white wine is used).  Served over egg noodles... a nice change from red sauce.

I was looking for something I could make to eat with leftover risotto, using ingredients I had on hand.  I'm glad I decided to try this, as I usually avoid recipes without many reviews.  I was surprised by how quickly the wine evaporated after I added it.  Maybe my burner temperature was too high, but the wine was gone after about 5 minutes - there was no sauce to speak of.  I continued cooking for the full 15 minutes.  Luckily, the meatballs were moist and had great flavor, even without the sauce.  The only complaint we had was that they were a hair too salty.  I will make these again with less salt and try cooking at a lower temperature.

Loved these meatballs! The only substitution I had to make was switched oregano for the tarragon, since I’m the only one that likes it.  Everyone loved them, even my picky grandson, who thanked me for the delicious food!

I cook for very picky eaters and this was a hit so I was very pleased.  I doubled recipe and changed sauce so the rest of the measurements will reflect that.  Used approx 2 cups of Marsala, 1 cup of broth and 1 cup of 1/2 n 1/2.  I was out of tarragon so I crushed 1 rsp fennel seed, then mixed with 1 tsp marjoram and 2 tsp basil.  Then used 4 tsp of this mixture in recipe.  The meatballs were served over angel hair pasta along with a salad. It was hot that day and this was a filling meal but not heavy.  Since everyone raved about the meal I will continue to make it this way.

Very tasty but too salty even with less added salt, the cheese is salty enough.
I will try baking the meatballs next time, less greasy that way, granted, I won't get any sauce but I'll see how it goes.

This recipe was easy to make. As with others, I also did not have sauce at the end of cooking which was disappointing. I omitted the salt. There was enough from the parmesan cheese and the onion powder. As someone else mentioned, I was hesitant to try a recipe with few reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised how tasty these meatballs are! This is my first review to help this recipe out!

This turned out to be a super simple but very tasty recipe - I can’t comment on the sauce as I didn’t make it (realizing too late that I had no wine or even apple juice) but the crispiness of the breadcrumbs went well with a bit of tomato sauce on spaghetti. The seasoning profile really wakes the pork up without being overwhelming. Even my preschooler who only eats like six things enjoyed them!

6 15 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/232462/pork-meatballs-in-white-wine-sauce/ ... Good.  Liked it. If I were to make again, I'd add more wine/chicken broth.  Thicken with those/that & then add heavy cream.  It would be on a non-dieting night.  :D  'Over a pasta or rice/risotto perhaps.
