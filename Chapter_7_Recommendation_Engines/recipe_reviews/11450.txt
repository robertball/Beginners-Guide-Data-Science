Great drop cookie!  I normally try to make some substitutions to try to put a little good in our goodies.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the rest unbleached flour.  I substituted trubinado sugar for the white sugar.  I substituted cashews for the walnuts, which we added directly to the dough.  The kids liked that the cookies do not spread much while cooking, so many can be cooked at one time.  (Which also allows for the cooling of many at one time and thus the eating of many.  LOL!)  We did not roll the cookies in nuts or sugar, for the first batch because we forgot.  We were glad we did.  These have a shortbread consistency without being too sweet.  They freeze well too.

Delicious!  I used pecans instead, sprinkled sugar on the tops and then baked 7 min on bottom rack / 3 minutes on top rack - taste was wonderful!!!  Texture was perfect too - I was searching for something just a *tad* chewier than Pepperidge Farm's Homestyle Sugar Cookies and this was it!  ***These do spread as they bake so be sure be sure to use smaller size drops....

These are great cookies.  My son has a peanut allergy, so we were looking for a cookie recipe similar to the peanut butter kiss cookies.  I made them into balls, rolled them in sugar and when they came out of the oven put a hershey kiss into them.  They are the BEST substiute we have found.  They are tasty frosted too!

Very tasty with a nice dry crumb. I used almonds instead of walnuts because that's all I had in the cupboard. Next time I want to try it with pecans. I took a few and dipped half in melted chocolate. They disappeared quickly!

This is one of the best sugar cookies I've ever made. This is definitely a keeper. It's crispy but yet not hard, it's tasty but not overwhelmingly sweet... It's perfect!

These cookies were pretty good, but the on the day we baked them they were kind of hard, although they weren't overbaked.  After keeping them in an airtight container overnight though, they were much softer and tastier!  I rated these a two for quickness because I was teaching a friend to bake cookies, and although the prep time said twenty minutes, it took us over an hour.  The taste of these cookies is quite good, but not excellent.  I enjoyed these cookies, but would  probably not make them again if I found a better recipe.

These  are addictive. I halved the recipe and followed it exactly. I was a little worried at first, as the dough is very oily before baking. The final product, though, is crispy outside, chewy inside. I chopped my walnuts very finely. I also made some as drop cookies and others rolled in sugar (colored) as stated in the description. This worked very well without chilling the dough. I used my smallest cookie scoop which holds about a heaping teaspoon. My half batch of dough made 72 cookies that baked in 12 minutes. I was expecting 30. Thanks for a keeper!

I didn't have cream of tartar, so I left it out and added 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of almond extract and pecans instead of walnuts.
They baked for 15 minutes and were still pale but cooked through.  They were great - especially with frosting.

Excellent cookies, I did used chopped pecans instead of walnuts, plus sugar sprinkle for the tops prior to baking and bake one pan at a time for better results!

I was looking for a cookie to use as a base for matcha green tea cookies. These cookies are good, but not quite 'crispy' in the way one generally thinks of cookies as being crispy.  They came out a bit sandy for me, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  Relatively easy to put together and I got 48 cookies halving the recipe.

For a simple sugar cookie recipe, this did the trick.  However, for my tastes, I wanted a little more so I made the "Cinnamon Bun Icing" recipe from this site and spread it on top of the cooled sugar cookies. Then I chopped up one hersheys milk chocolate bar in my processer and sprinkled a generous portion on top of the icing.  My husband who doesnt even like cheesecake (which is what the icing tastes like) gobbled them up.  When I brought these to a baby shower, everyone raved!  By adding these tips, these cookies were fabulous.

I'd give it more stars if I could.  Very nice, tasty cookie.  Almost on the delicate side & very crispy.  Maybe I made them too thin, but we just loved them.  One problem, I had lots of dough, so I thought I'd freeze some to make for later.  I took it out this morning to thaw & while trying to shape the cookies, the dough kept coming apart.  However, I did get them shaped & baked.  Made them a little thicker this time & just as good as the first batch.  It's a keeper.

This was a pretty good cookie! It was a little too crumbly for my liking, but the taste was almost exactly like a store bought sugar cookie.  Next time I will probably try frosting or maybe a jam thumbprint to spice it up.

I used Lemon extract and my cookies sell like no others at school bake sales.  They come out light and crispy.  I think my kids make up reasons for me to bake cookies for their classes.

I found these to be very bland.  If I make these again, I would make them with a thumbprint of jam in the middle to add some flavor.

I've just found this recipe again after making it for the first time months ago.  I made a batch and then made the mistake of taking them into work.  On the good side I was an extremely popular boss that day.  On the bad side...I only got TWO COOKIES out of the whole box, because everyone loved them so much!  *grin*

Great recipe, I look forward to eating more of them when I make them over the next day or so.  Thank you!

This is by far the best cookie that I have ever made. My kids and grandkids just love them.  Our little toy schnauzer can smell the cookie as soon as someone takes one out of the bad.  She follows us around, begging until we give her a bite.

Okay, these cookies are sooo good!  I just took my last batch out ot the oven and WOW!  I read some of the comments about them being like a sandie and that is what sold me.  I have looked over the recipe several times but didnt ever try it because of the nuts.  I dont know why, because I love nuts, but for some reason they just didn't sound good.  I halved the recipe and still got almost 4 dozen cookies.  I forgot to add the nuts to the first half of the dough, but got them in the second half.  I used almond, because that is what I had on hand and used half of the butter and replaced the other half with sour cream 'cause I had a little I needed to get rid of.  They came out nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside (they still arent all the way cooled, so they may crisp up inside).  They dont have chocolate in them, but the recipe is on its way to my recipe book.

I can't believe anyone liked this recipe. They came out looking like biscuits, but if you sprinkle sugar on top, ... then they look like biscuits with sugar on top. They taste like a really fine grain edible sand paper with a hint of sweetness. The only way I found to redeem the recipe somewhat was to put macadamia nuts on top. Maybe I'll experiment with less (or no) oil, and less flour.  I don't see how anyone could describe the texture as crisp. It's remotely like a sandie.

This has got to be the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever found. The cookies turn out beautiful and they aren't too dry or too moist. I omit the walnuts, but I'm sure they'd be great with those, or with pecans. If I had a list of top ten favorite cookie recipes, this would be on it.

I was almost going to give this recipe 5 stars... They were sooo good when they came out of the oven, but just 30 minutes later, they were dry and crumbly! They're good, but not incredible... Be armed with a glass of milk!

Fantastic!  I rolled some into balls, flattened with a glass, and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar- tasted just like snickerdoodles.  The rest I frosted with powdered sugar icing for my son's preschool class.  The kids loved them, and the teachers asked for the recipe!

My family loved these cookies!  I made them with freshly ground whole wheat flour and dehydrated cane sugar.  I rolled some of them in walnuts and some in cinammon sugar.  They came out wonderfully, even after freezing the cookie dough in little balls and cookie right out of the freezer.  We'll be making these again.  I might add another 1/4 cup flour to give them a little more firmness.

I baked these cookies last night. Everyone just raved on them and my husband loved them.  Thank You for a great cookie recipe.  They have a very unique Sugar Cookie taste with nuts.  I did sprinkle sugar over the tops of mine after I had criss-crossed them with a fork.  Very delicious.

I recently made these cookies for my son's fundraiser at school. They are excellent cookies that melt in your mouth and leave everyone wanting more! My 3 yr old daughter was able to help make these cookies which she and I both enjoy.

I as out of vanilla extract, and an online site suggested substituting pancake syrup for vanilla. Since they were cookies for kids in class who arent going to be picky, I decided to try it. They turned out amazing! I will definitely be making them again with the syrup and trying it without.

I baked these cookies for our neighbors, and they loved it.  The suggestion to add cardamom (1 tsp) was a terrific idea!

these were great.  still, i think i did something wrong.  they didn't come out crispy or nutty, but everyone still gobbled them up.
