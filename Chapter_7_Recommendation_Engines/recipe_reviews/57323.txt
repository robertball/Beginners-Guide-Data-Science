I really wasn't expecting to like this but I thought I would give it a try and it's a good thing because I think this is an awesome dish!  So many people said it lacked flavor that I made some small additions.  I added 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp of cajun seasoning.  It's fantastic and tastes just like pasta I've had at some restaurants.   Try it!  The additional salt in the garlic salt and the kick from the cajun seasoning are really good.

This was a quick, easy and tasty recipe!  I used cream of mushroom, and yellow onion, as I did not have any green...Also, I used imitation lobster, chopped and canned peas instead of frozen.  It came out great---super fast!  I would make this again.  Thanks for sharing :)

After reading the reviews, I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used chive and onion cream cheese (I omitted the chives all together because of this), and added some seasoned salt. I am not a fan of peas so I used broccoli and spinach instead. It came out quite nice!

My family and I werent too fond of this recipe. I thought it was too bland even though I added extra seasonings and used chive and onion cream cheese. I didnt like the celery soup at all. I have a similar recipe that I will be sticking with.

This was so good - it brought to mind a pasta dish I order a lot at a local restaraunt.  It was rich and tasty and flavored just right.  I will definitely be making it again!

This is a good dish but will try with chicken next time and hardly any onions.  The green onions were over powering and I love onions.  Also, a dash of season salt and garlic powder made it more flavorful.  The homeade alfredo sauce to this receipe would be great on many other kinds of foods as well.

I was really disappointed with this recipe!!  In my opinion, it's lacking TONS of flavor! I probably won't ever make this again...but if I do, I may try making it with chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain...cut the amount of peas by half...maybe add some Old Bay, garlic, parmesan,...The recipe definitley has potential -- it just needs MORE!!

Very easy, very quick.  I had to make a few changes...  I did not use ANY of the milk.  I used a can of sliced mushrooms WITH their liquid.  I added minced garlic. Ommited onions (picky kids!) using onion powder instead.  I replaced the peas with chopped frozen broccoli (defrosed).  IT WAS A HIT!!!  Missing something...some spice I think, but everyone wolfed it down!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this again !

A bit bland as others have mentioned. Needs garlic and/or other seasoning. The leftovers were suprisingly good cold - essentially a pasta seafood salad. Will make again.

We were disappointed by this recipe.  I was stuck eating the leftovers...which were surprisingly a bit better than on the night we made it...but we won't make this again.

I thought it was somewhat bland.  I added garlic powder, paprika, and lemon pepper while it was cooking, but it was still missing something.  I think some white wine might have made a difference.

We liked this!  My two year old son ate it and ate it!  Even with the green peas in it, and that would usually not happen.  It is not a spicy dish and really doesn't have "kick", more like a comfort food.  So if you are looking for something with "bite" this isn't it, it's more of an alfredo type dish.  One thing I may do if I make it again, is use like a chive flavored cream cheese, or vegetable flavored or something.  That sounds really good.  Oh, I added fresh mushrooms that I sauteed a little with the green onions because my son loves mushrooms (anything to get veggies in the little guy)!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was so good and easy to make... i didnt rate it a 5 because i think it could have used alittle extra spice... the only question i have is imitation crab meat cooked when you buy it.. i didnt know so i cooked the meat a while... but it was good.

Bland even with adding recommendations of garlic, garlic salt, and cajun seasoning. Not something I will make again.

I didn't have any green onions & I added a can of sliced mushrooms, plus used garden vegetable flavored cream cheese - and I'm thinking I probably won't make it again.  Fairly bland (put pretty good for those little one's taste buds - hence the 3 stars).

This was excellent!  I did add some sauteed garlic and cajun seasoning to give it some kick, but very yummy.  We will definitely have this one again.

Great!  I made this recipe without any alterations and was very happy with the result!  The leftovers warmed up well and my friends at work were impressed that I had made this dish myself.  Plus, it's easy to make!

This pasta dish is fabulous.  Searching online one day I found it and went shopping for the ingredients that I didn't have - but couldn't quite remember what those were.  I ended up making this with cream of mushroom soup and a red pepper instead of green onions.  It was great anyway and I try to work in into dinner once a month now.

This was very simple and quick to make. I do agree with the previous review about it being a bit bland, so I added 1 teaspoon of Lemon Pepper and 2 teaspoons Cajun Spice. I certainly would prepare this again. It would be a great dish for short notice entertaining.
