I was skeptical, but went for this recipe when it came in my email and really enjoyed the sweetness of the berries in contrast to the vinegary italian dressing I used.

A nice fresh combination of flavours to liven up a typical green salad. Not so sure how 'romantic' it is but a nice version of a salad.
