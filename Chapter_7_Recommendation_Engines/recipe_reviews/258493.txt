I have been on the search for cracking the code on how to make the "perfect" potato salad for most of my life... and I've found it!  This recipe is that "classic" potato salad that is served at picnics, graduation parties, church gatherings whose combination of flavors and creamy-chunky mouth appeal and a taste oh-so-satisfying - is spot on and exactly what you wanted.  My only tweaks were to add 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar and I used yellow mustard and white vinegar.  Yum!!  Than you Chef John! (Oh, and one extra egg)

This is the best potato salad I have ever made.  The store had no celery whatsoever (odd, huh?) so I added some diced up dill pickle.  I followed recipe beyond that.  I did add some more mayo to the finished product.  Everyone that ate it loved it.  This is definitely a five star salad.  If it isn't, you did something wrong.

A classic potato salad recipe that can be tweaked with what you have on hand. Comes out perfect every time no matter how I tweak it!

I found that if you combine all the ingredients together and then pour onto the potatoes, you have less break-up of the potato chunks.  let sit at room temp after that so the potatoes gather up all the ingredients flavor.  Chill, covered overnight and then test for salt, pepper and sugar the next day.  The true flavor of this dish will be after about 24 hours.  Great job Chef, once again!!!

We loved it! I found it made a big difference using russet potatoes and using the 1/4 cup Kosher salt! I followed the recipe as written.  I used to cover my boiling potatoes with a lid. Just had to add a little more boiling water to the pot from time to time to keep the potatoes covered in water. I didn't use any onions and added more celery and hard boiled eggs. I also added some chopped sweet red pepper. Thanks Chef John!

I love this  salad.  I added a few chopped dill pickles to the salad as my mom always added it.  So good!  Will make it again!

I usually never alter a Chef John recipe as they are always perfect made as listed. Since Chef John did say it was okay to add other ingredients, I added 4 sliced peperoncini and 3 sliced small dill pickles. This is a fabulous potato salad recipe.

It’s not often that I write recipe reviews, but this one deserves positive feedback. I followed the recipe “exactly” as written, and I’m pleased to say that this was one of the best potato salads I’ve had. My dinner guests were pleased, as well. 

Hats off to you, Chef John!

Delicious!  I’ve been trying to make potato salad that tasted like the ones from my childhood, down South, for decades.  And now, finally, I have!  Oh, I cooked my cut up potatoes and raw eggs in shell, together in the instant pot, for exactly four minutes, with 1.5 cups of water, and a quick-release.  So easy!  Thank you for the dressing, Chef John!  And all the measurements and ingredients, and especially the demand we wait until the potatoes are room temperature!

Great recipe! I added 3 Tbsp sugar, 3 Tbsp pickle relish, and added 1/4 cup mayonnaise just before serving. The apple cider vinegar was a little strong for my taste at first, but after sitting in the refrigerator over night it was perfect.

I have always been impressed with all the recipes I've stolen from Chef John... until now.   Delete the cider vinegar. Delete the cayenne.  The first bite was sour from the vinegar and as you ate the cayenne pepper caught up with you overpowering the other flavours. Otherwise it's a nice plain potato salad.  Not bad but I'm not replacing my usual recipe.

Made a double batch for a potluck.  Followed the recipe fairly closely, doubling the ingredients.  About half eaten and this was the only potato salad, lots of other similar dishes.  I enjoyed it.  My only thought is to reduce or eliminate the apple cider vinegar.  Other than that an excellent and easy dish.  Good suggestions by Chef John for preparation, as is normal with  his recipes.

I left the potatoes in chunks, used red onion and added some chopped dill pickle, and it is one of the best potato salads ever in MHO. I also had to adjust the measurements down a little as I didn't have as many potatoes. I also mixed the dressing in a small bowl before adding to the potatoes, onion, and celery to help the chunks not break down much. Will definitely make it again!

To be honest, I found to potato salad a bit bland, though others enjoyed it.  Not sure if it was worth all the preparation.

I used dill instead of parsley, and chopped a few dill pickles in as well. Delicious
