I forgot to add the necessary 1 tsp ground flax seeds in this recipe.
You can use maple syrup instead of brown sugar, which is what I prefer to do. you can also use rice milk or your milk of choice if desired, but they may give different effects due to their consistency.

These are really good. It's a different taste, but a welcomed different taste. They go really well with sunflower butter spread on them!

Loved the flavor but had huge problems with texture.  Added more water but was afraid to add too much.  Never got it to pour and even spreading was difficult.  They were not pretty but I will work on it as the taste was great. Served with my usual crepe filling of cream cheese and sour cream mixed with a bit of powdered sugar  and some thawed blueberries. Edit: I tried again, adding another egg and 2 T ground flax. Still difficult to work into a "crepe"  so I  made them "pancakes" instead.

I used honey instead of sugar, and omitted the salt.  This was my first time making crepes, and found them easy to make with this recipe!  I love the use of buckwheat!

Even my picky eater asked for seconds!
Instead of flipping them a second time I spread them with peanut butter and a layer of sliced banana so the filling would be warm.  

I'll probably try them again, without the sugar, in place of tortillas.  (Gluten free corn tortillas just aren't doing for me.)

I don't have much time in the morning & I prefer a breakfast that can be made faster than this one but it was good! The recipe for 1 made three pancakes but no where in the recipe did it indicate that! None of the "similar" recipes are gluten-free so they are not really similar.
