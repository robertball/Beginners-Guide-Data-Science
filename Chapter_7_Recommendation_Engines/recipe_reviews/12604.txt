I made this recipe for a fish fry last weekend. I made two batches to experiment- one using store bought cookie dough and one using the recipe from scratch. Neither my husband nor I could tell the difference once the toppings were on, so my advice is to just buy the prepared dough! I decided to make a dozen mini personal pizzas which looked great but took a little longer to decorate (see picture I submitted). This made it easy to eat without a fork/plate. 

I used marshmallow cream (13oz jar) with the double batch of cheese to lighten it up. I had baked the cookies, chopped the fruit and mixed the cheese the previous night and by the time I finished decorating the mini pizzas (had about 12 with 2 batches), the cheese was very soft. We had a sample at that point and it was great. By the time we drove an hour to the party, dinner was delayed & some folks did not have dessert for 2-3 more hours later. These pizzas did get VERY soggy after the point of 5 or 6 hours. This is not a good recipe for leaving out on a buffet for an all-day BBQ. My recommendation is to make sure you have space in a fridge (which is tricky if you're a guest) and only leave them out for 2 hours maximum before serving. This is a better "served" dish rather than a "grazing" dessert. I still had lots of compliments and they still tasted great, crispy or soggy!

The fruit I used were strawberries, blueberries, kiwis, nectarines, grapes, and mandarin oranges. Excellent combination!

Made a few changes but fantastic recipe.  After reading the reviews I was worried about the pizza becoming soggy since this would be going to the office and sitting out for a while.  I decided to make individual pizzas to make it easier to eat. I  placed small balls of dough and pressed into the bottom of cupcake holders. I baked a couple dozen at a time on cookie sheets and cooked for longer than recommended.  I baked until they were a golden brown on the edges (some were turning golden all the way thru depending on thickness) when cooled it was a cracker consistency.  Cooking them this way made a really nice contrast with the creaminess of the icing and the cookies stayed very crisp without any sogginess.  I also used less powdered sugar since the sugar tends to make the cream cheese more runny.

Several office workers said it was the best cookie they had ever had.

Wow!!!!!!  This was even better than I expected.  A big thanks goes to the reviewers who said: 1)cut the crust with filling before adding fruit, 2)be sure fruit is dry, 3)add some cool whip to the filling mixture, and 4)put waxed paper over the dough to spread it evenly.  We loved it!!  I just used the good old strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and kiwi.

Quick, easy and cream cheesy!  Everyone loved this and requested it for our next family event.  One thing to mention, though: let your fruit drain in a collander for quite a while before adding it to the pizza.  Otherwise you will end up with soggy crust.

I made this for my family's big get-together this last weekend and this was a huge hit! A few changes I made were I added 1/2 package fat-free vanilla pudding mix to the cream cheese filling. It just adds to the yummyness! I used apples, peaches, grapes, bananas and strawberries. One tip, after spreading your fillin gon freeze the crust with filling for about an hour or so then remove it and cut it inthe pan to the servings you want. THEN arrange your fruit on top of your serving cuts. I still managed to have a very nice looking presentation on the whole and was much easier to serve instead of trying to cut through the fruit. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was the best fruit pizza recipe I have found.  Try doubling the sugar cookie and baking it in a 9x13 pan.  It is terrific.

This one is okay, but it is so much easier if you use prepackaged cookie dough, cuts WAY down on the mess and prep time. I also switched around the "sauce" and used 8 oz. frozen whipped topping thawed, and 8 oz cream cheese, 2 t vanilla (pure, of course) and liked it much better.

Very easy very delicious!  I also used ready made sugar cookie dough.  I baked it on my Pampered Chef stone, you can roll the dough if you put wax paper on top.  For one party I used strawberries, raspberries & blueberries and put more Cool Whip on top.  Then used the fruit & decorated it as the US Flag!  Also substituted Tofu cream cheese & non-dairy topping for a lactose intolerant group!  Great recipe!

I really love this dessert. I used refrigerated cookie dough, but I made several smaller cookies instead of one large one. I baked the cookies until they were brown on the edges. Then I let my kids each make their own pizzas. My whole family had a great time together in the kitchen! We'll definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe twice and found that I needed to make the following changes to make it excellent:  1. I used confectioners sugar instead of white sugar in the topping (thicker consistency). 2. I added 1 8 oz container of cool whip to the topping (lighter and holds together better).  3. I decreased the sugar in the cookie from 3/4 to 2/3 cup.  4. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the cookie crust.   With these changes people rave about this recipe!

this was a big hit at work. Everyone liked it. The only issue I had was in the wording. I read white sugar and just used regular granulated sugar. I realized as I was making the topping that it should be confectioner's sugar. That would have been helpful to know up front. Will retry it with the right sugar.

AWESOME! I have made this several times and ALWAYS get rave reviews! I make 1 minor change, and that is a glaze. I heat 1 cup of unsweetened pineapple juice with 1/2 cup sugar, a dash of salt, 1/2 Tablespoon lemon juice and 2 Tablespoons cornstarch. Heat to boiling, boil and stir 1 minute. Let cool to room temp then drizzle over fruit. It is soooooooo DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing, Anne!

I also made this in a cookie size. It makes it a lot easier to serve. The first batch came out too thick to serve as cookies so I had to slice it in half while they were still warm to make them thinner. Using a tablespoon full of dough is about right amouht to make it cookie size. The cookies were really easy to make and doesn't take that much time to bake. The time consuming part is really decorating the cookies. I made the cookies a day ahead of time because I had a large menu for 40+ guests. Kept it in the fridge. I added a box of vanilla pudding to the spread and it came out delicious. All the guests raved about it. I used strawberries, kiwis, bananas, blueberries, raspberries & madarin orange.  Don't forget to dry the fruits with paper towels after you wash them. See my photos in the photo gallery.

Way Too Sweet! I followed the directions exactly the first time and while everyone liked it, the standard comment was "wow, this is sweet".

The next time I made this I omitted a lot of the sugar. For the crust, I used 1/2 cup sugar and for the cream cheese mixture I used 1/4 a cup. I topped with kiwi, blackberries, and strawberries. It was a HUGE HIT!

Fantastic recipe! I brushed a very light coat of raspberry jam onto the cookie before baking.  When  cooled it firms up a bit and makes a nice barrier between the toppings and cookie which helps to prevent some sogginess.  I lowered the amount of sugar in the cream cheese a tad to balance the added sweetness of the jam but I don't think it's necessary to do.

After reading many reviews I decided to use a different recipe for the crust.  Perfect!  It was not served till 5 hrs after it was made and there were no signs of it being soggy, I had a piece the following day and it still wasn't soggy.  The following recipe does not contain a lot of sugar, so for those that thought it was too sweet... give this a try: 3 cups of flour.  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder.  1 cup butter (room temp/softened).  1 cup sugar.  1 egg(room temp).  1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cream sugar and butter together, mix in egg and vanilla.  Add in all dry ingredients and mix by hand.  Dough may seem a little flaky.  Roll out with wax/parchment paper on to pan.  Hints: using a baking stone gives best results.  My crust kinda stuck to the pan so it took a little work when serving... maybe bake it on parchment paper?  It tasted as good as it looked.  My father in law said it was like the desserts you get in high end restaurants!

I'm giving this 5 stars, but I did make some changes.  First, I made the "sauce" with 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 a tub of cool whip, 4 T. of powdered sugar,and 1/2 a small container of fluff blended together. Yum.  I didn't think the crust recipe would make enough, so I doubled the recipe.  It was way more than needed, but I ended up making a second smaller pizza.  Darn.  You MUST grease the pan.  I didn't and had a heck of a time getting it out of the pan.  I used waxed paper after reading another comment about how sticky the dough is and it worked fine.  Make sure you leave ~1/2" on the edge of the pan because it will expand a lot.  Everyone that ate it raved!  Thanks for the recipe.

Every time I make this I get asked for the recipe.  So I just send them to this site.  I've made this for our youth group's pie auction and it sold for $500!  One thing I changed was that I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup in the crust and 1/4 cup in the cream cheese mixture.  And it still taste absolutely delicious.  So easy to make yet it looks like you spent so much time and $ to make it.  Thank you Anne!

Very good. I made a different version also and the majority of those on the 4th voted for this one. Very pretty and tasty. We used bananas, peaches, blueberries, cherries, kiwi. Very colorful for the 4th.

My Mom has been making this recipe for years! We usually use store bought sugar cookie dough. We slice into circles and line them up in the pan. We use powdered sugar over regular sugar, which takes away some of the sweetness.You could also substitute the vanilla for grand marnier, or maybe kahlua. For the fourth of july, we use blueberries and strawberries. For any other event, we just use fruit that is in season.

This made a BEAUTIFUL presentation!  I took it to a work luncheon, and it couldn't have been simpler to make, and EVERYONE loved it!  They didn't leave a crumb on the pizza pan!  Lots of requests for the recipe, too!  I used strawberries, cut in half, kiwi, and peaches.  Recommend this to everyone as a great simple, anytime dessert that you want to impress with! This one is a definitely a "keeper", and will make again, and again, and again....

This is a delicous treat! I made this for Easter, followed the cookie recipe and the frosting recipe exactly. Turned out beautifully! I topped it with blueberries, kiwi, strawberries, banana, pineapple and mango, then sprinkled coconut over the whole thing to look like mozzarella cheese. I did follow the other reviewers' tip to cut the "crust" after it was frosted and cooled, before I put the fruit on. That made it much easier to serve, and ensured that every piece got the same amount of "toppings".

I made this instead of the trans fat filled version of the sugar cookies in a tube, fruit pizza recipe. Made a double batch of the cookies (but cut out some of the sugar) for two pizzas in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer; it was easy and they turned out great. Just make sure to put some vanilla extract in the dough, tastes much better that way. Much easier to pat this out than the refrigerated dough too. Baked until it was toasty brown and crunchy when cool. The next day what little was left was not soggy at all, btw. I also drizzled over the top a glaze of orange marmalade and juice from the canned mandarin oranges I used. I doubled the cream cheese topping for the two pizzas; I used a small container of marscapone cheese along with the regular cream cheese. I could have eaten that mixture with a spoon!  I took this to my in-laws for Father's day dinner and everyone raved about it and had second helpings.

I almost didn't review because I made so many changes, but I figured my mods may be helpful to others and it's a great recipe anyway, so...I realized I had no cream of tartar so i followed one of the top reviewers advice and used break & beak sugar cookie dough for my "crust".  I recently discovered "Fruit Dip VI" from this site and my dad loved it, so I used it for my "sauce" (same concept, just used brown Splenda blend instead of white sugar).  I topped w/grapes, kiwi, bananas, strawberries, and peaches.  Looked awesome, tasted great, and was gone in literally minutes.  However, next time, I will dice the fruit for eating ease.

I made this for a get together we went to this weekend and everyone loved it! I cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese a little though and it was still to sweet for me. But it was yummy and makes a beautiful impressive dessert! Worth making from scratch it was very simple and the crust tasted great, I think If I used the sugar cookie base it would have been a sugar overload, it's sweet enough without it.

Fantastically perfect! Made it exactly the way it says. No  changes. I don't know why people review this recipe and list off all the changes they made. Give a review of the recipe as it is so other people can read reviews of the recipe posted!! So annoying.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always requested by my friends. I use a cookie sheet I have never done it on a pizza pan. I always double the cream cheese spread so it would be 2 packages of cream cheese, 1 cup of white sugar, and 4 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  My picture is number 98 in the photos if you want to see what it looks like. You will not be disappointed making this recipe.

The crust is pretty hard to spread.  I used a normal jelly roll pan, and couldn't get it to the edges.  Try to spread it as thin as possible though b/c it will puff up.  I also doubled the cream cheese filling and put in about 1/4 cup orange juice instead of vanilla (could have put in more though!).  I didn't use the full 1/2 cup sugar after taste-testing it.  After cutting the fruit, I laid it out on paper towels to drain well.  Mine didn't get soggy b/c of this.

This was a HUGE hit for a family dinner I attended recently. Everyone raved about it and even though there were only 8 of us, the fruit pizza disappeared in no time. I followed the recipe exactly and topped with fresh sliced strawberries and frozen blueberries (I put the pizza in the freezer for about 30 minutes immediately after topping with the fruit, and then put it in the fridge for the remaining 30 minutes before it was served; fresh blueberries would have been ideal). I baked it on a cookie sheet and it took about 16 minutes to bake to perfection. I can't wait to make this again, I am thinking about doing it instead of a cake for my son's birthday coming up -- it's that good!

This recipes was very delicious I had people hurrying for more. The only thing I did different was I let the cookie refrigerate it overnight after I baked it. Then the next day I added my fruit and cream cheese mixture... Other than that TEN THUMBS UP... LOL

This recipe turned out wonderful! I used refrigerated sugar cookie dough as a shortcut and it wasn't missing a thing. I served it after chilling for 1 hour and found that the leftovers tasted even better after 2 more hours of chilling after the party. So I would recommend a chill time of at least 2 hours for the best taste.

really good recipe, after reading reviews about soggy crust I took white chocolate chips and sprinkled them on top until soft & melted. The melted chocolate will create a barrier on crust.  Using a spatula to skim melted chocolate over entire top , the crust had a thin layer of crisp hard chocolate.  This step created a barrier and pizza never got to the soggy point even being left out for a few hours.

Made today to bring to work.  I have been here for 2 hours and it is all gone from the teacher's lounge.  I topped mine with strawberries, kiwis and blueberries.  Perfect for a dessert that you can start the night before and assemble in the morning.

Wow, this was so good! We loved the cookie crust. Don't miss out by using pre-made cookie dough; it's easy to make and only takes minutes - really worth making from scratch. To me, the crust is what makes it so delicious.   We didn't have a pizza pan, so I used the bottom of my springform pan, and then set it all on a cookie sheet to bake. Worked great. We topped ours with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries - really delicious. We will definitely make this one again. I used reduced fat cream cheese, and it still tasted great.

I love this recipe.  It turned out beautifully and I got so many compliments on its appearance and taste.  I used all ready made sugar cookie dough.  I baked it a little long; but that actually turned out to be a good thing because then the cookie never became soggy.

This was fantastic! Adults and kids loved it so much that we all had seconds! I had to stop my 4-year old daughter from getting a third slice! It's also easy to make: my 9-year old daughter made it, with only some slight directive help. We didn't use cream of tartar, since we didn't have it, and it was fine. We used strawberries,  blueberries, and bananas, and the presentation was beautiful!

I tried to make this a bit healthier by using 1/2 c honey & 1/4 c turbanado sugar, using the egg white only, and whole wheat flour.  It turned out GREAT.  Lowfat cream cheese is also a helper.

I have used this recipe for a long time now! Every time I make it everyone says it's so good. My advice is NOT to buy the cookie dough from the store, some have said that it does not make a difference in the taste, but believe me it does! Those store bought cookie doughs have so many perservatives in them, they don't taste as fresh as made from scratch dough. Take the extra 10 minutes to mix the ingredients for the dough, you'll be happy you did. If you have stoneware, this bakes great on the round stone. Don't overbake the dough or it will get too crunchy, unless you like it like that. This is a great summer dessert to bring to BBQ's and get-togethers.

This was great! I used refrigerated cookie dough (make sure you let it sit out for a bit to soften before you flatten it). After baking, I used the cream cheese frosting from this recipe, and topped the pizza with strawberries, red and purple grapes, and pineapple. I took it to a church event, and came home with tons of compliments and an empty pan!

This is an awesome party dish! So easy and delicious! Make sure to assemble it right before serving (I baked the cookie ahead of time though)-- if you let it sit too long the fruit will turn it soggy.

I served this at my son's birthday party and it was ahit with the adults and kids.  This homemade crust tastes so much better than a recipe I had used that called for frozen cookie dough for crust.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Great recipe.  I made this recipe for my sister's baby shower and it was a big hit.  Several people asked for the recipe.  One suggestion I had would be to make sure you use flour while spreading the dough on the pan.  The dough is fairly sticky and it is easier to work with when you have flour to work it around with.  And for the topping, I used 1/2 cup of powdered sugar instead of regular granulated sugar--it was not as grainy this way.  I also stirred in an 8 oz package of Cool whip after I creamed together the sugar and cream cheese to make the topping a little thicker.

This is so yummy that I almost wish I had never found it.  I used strawberry cream cheese mixed with marshmallow fluff and decorated it with bananas (soaked in lemon/lime pop to keep from browning) and strawberry pie filling.  Our friends demolished it and came back for fourth and fifth helpings!  Go for the homemade cookie part--it's about as easy as buying storebought but probably much better for you.  Thank you for my new favorite dessert!

This was good and easy!  Like others, I took the short cut and used prepared sugar cookie dough rolled out to fit my pan.  I tinted the cream cheese pink, as this was for Easter dessert, and topped with sliced strawberries and blueberries.  It wasn't too sweet and seemed to be well-liked by my guests - thanks!

I personally thought it was way too sweet but my husband and daughter loved it.  I used Pillsbury cookie dough because reviewers said there was no difference in taste.  I will try again making my own crust and changing the frosting.

Wow!  This was sooooo good!  The sugar cookie crust is now my "go to" sugar cookie recipe!  Delicious!  Also, I only used 1/2 cup (1/4 cup less) of sugar and it was still awesome!

This was absolutely delicious! I took it to another couple's house for a dinner party (I was asked to bring the dessert), and everyone went for seconds. The hostess even asked for the recipe. I drained the fruit very well before putting it on the pizza and kept it refrigerated before serving, and it didn't get mushy at all. I used canned mandarin oranges and fresh strawberries, pineapple and kiwi. I though this assortment made it nice and colorful. I made it exactly according to the recipe here and found that I had the perfect amount of "frosting." The cookie cooked perfectly in 10 minutes at 350 degrees. It was cooked all the way through but stayed nice and soft (didn't get too crispy). Will definitely make again and again! :)

Yummy, but I did use the cookie crust and put it in a big jelly pan...I used 3 cookie crusts, which was too much, would use two next time. Delicious, thank you! Also, I've seen some recipes with glazes, but this one doesn't have that part to it.

Tasted better than the ones I've had from the grocery store. Of course, mine was made with an extra dash of love, so that was probably why! :)

This was so good!  I thought that the homemade cookie crust was much better than using the store-bought sugar cookie dough.  It was soft, but held up well even with all the toppings.  I baked mine in a small jelly roll pan and the dough was sticky to spread, but not impossible.  The only changes that I made were using maybe half cup of whipped topping and powdered sugar instead of regular sugar in the topping.  Since I only had fresh strawberries, I also used really well-drained canned pineapple tidbits and mandarin oranges and they worked out fine.  Thanks for a great recipe- I'll definitely be making this again soon!

Quick and easy to make from scratch. I try to keep the fruit light so the cookie doesn't become weighed down, I usually stick to blueberries and strawberries. Make sure your fruit dry, otherwise the cookie will turn soggy.

I just made this for a baby shower in the form of little tarts.  I use premade cookie dough also and change the sauce.  If you mix one tub of strawberry cream cheese with on regular size jar of marshmallow creme, you get the most AMAZING sauce/ fruit dip.  All fruit is good with this sauce but I really like bananas, strawberries, grapes, and blue berries.  Kiwi is so yummy but tends to be expensive.

I highly suggest this recipe, it was a huge hit!  I cheated a bit on this one due to a time crunch but everybody loved it so I will probably continue to cheat :)  I used sugar cookie dough and cream cheese flavored cake icing.

Great recipe for kids!! My daughter absolutely loves this one. I made it along with homemade pizza-and when I say homemade, I mean it! Homemade sauce with fresh seasonings and homemade crust with fresh toppings!- and it was all a hit!  

BIG TIP though! Instead of using sugar to whip with the cream cheese, keep the vanilla and substitute the 1/2 c. sugar with MARSHMALLOW FLUFF!! YUM!!  Blend it until smooth and spread over cooled cookie dough.  I kept it simple and just added fresh strawberries and blueberries. I would suggest making this treat on the Fourth of July, because mine definitely looked patriotic! =)

It was a very beautiful dessert, but i just wasn't wowed by the taste.  I guess i'm just not a fruit pizza kind of girl!  I think i would prefer it with a lighter crust (like a rice krispie/marshmallow base).

I took away one star because the frosting was too sweet or something.I made it for a 4th of July get together last night and I made it again tonight for another 4th get together but I changed the frosting to one I had for another recipe. I uses 1 cup of powder sugar and 2 drops of vanilla instead of the half of cup of white sugar. It made it SO MUCH BETTER! Overall the recipe is really good though:)

Excellent!  I made ths for my son's preschool graduation party and everybody loved it.  Even the kids ate it!  This is a keeper.

Note:  I first tried another recipe that called for refrigerated sugar cookie dough.  I made the dough according to the directions and it stuck to the pizza pan!  I then quickly found this recipe and luckily I had all the ingredients and I was saved!  LOL!  Sometimes trying to save time and use something pre-made just doesn't cut it.

This was a spectacular recipe.  I was blown away by the taste of this and by the simplicity of the recipe. This will be a family favorite for years to come.  For a topping I used a a small bag of frozen blueberries and a bag of frozen rasberries.  The texture and contrasting taste of the sweet crust vs. the tart berries, was wonderful.  My husband and I ate the whole thing that same day.  Yumm!!!!  Thank you for this great recipe.

Good recipe!  I too used ready made cookie dough, then I add 2 cups of cool whip and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla to the spread mixture!  It turned out great and was not too sweet as the reagular spread is. The kids and adults loved it!!

Another variation to the cream cheese "pizza sauce" is to mix together strawberry cream cheese with marshmallow fluff.  Then spread it on your "pizza crust" and add the fruit.  Cherry pie filling is very good, also, spread over the top of the cream cheese.

I love this recipe! Try using a brownie mix for the crust(just make according to directions) I used the 9x13 and put it in an 11x17 cookie sheet. After the fruit is on drizzle with 1/2 cup semisweet choclate chips melted with 2 Tablespoons butter for a delicious chocolate lovers version!

It's a hit! Our whole family loves it! The taste is fantastic, and I love how easy it is. The only thing I did different (to save a bundle of time) was buy ready to bake sugar cookie dough. I put in the freezer for a few minutes and then sliced it, laying the slices connected on a pizza sheet (I couldn't get it to roll out). It works great, and tastes great. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

YES!! The glaze puts this over the top, don't skip it. I didn't know if it would make it soggy so I went a little light on it, but I won't next time. My crust didn't get super soft till about 24 hrs later. I originally cut it after 8hrs. and the texture was still like a cookie.I drained the mandarin oranges in a sieve and they worked well with the other fruits. WINNER!!

I am confused by all of these reviews -- many people used pre-made cookie dough and/or marshmallow fluff instead of following the recipe and making it themselves -- what is the point of the recipe if you are just going to use all store bought stuff?  Personally, I loved it...my crust did stick to the pan slightly so next time I will use parchment paper, but other than that, it got rave reviews and I am always happy to serve guests something I have prepared from scratch rather than from a can.

The crust part of this recipe was delicious!  I covered the pizza pan with foil and it stuck though...but that's workable.  I did not use the cream cheese portion of this recipe...sounds gross with just cream cheese and sugar.  Instead, I used the fruit pizza II recipe on this site that used 1 pkg cream cheese and 1 tub whipped topping.  Topped the pizza with sliced kiwis, strawberries, and blueberries!  Quite an expensive recipe when the fruits aren't on sale =\

Wouldnt use the cream cheese topping. 2 tsp of vanilla was way too much. I would only do 1 tsp at most. Be sure to really whip the cream cheese filling, texture may be an issue if not prepared right.

This was very good, but you only need about half of the cream cheese mixture. A whole 8 oz. box was way more than was needed.

Amazingly delicious! It tasted better than it looked and it looked beautiful. Here are some things I wish I would have known: The pizza pan size isn’t stated anywhere I used a 14 inch pan. I purchased one premade sugar cookie packet of dough and had to spread it extremely thin. I would suggest purchasing two packs of dough if you want a thicker crust. The thin crust worked well so how much to use comes to preference. On my decorating I used one medium container of strawberries, two bananas, two tangerines, two kiwis and three strawberries for the center. Good luck and enjoy!

Awesome!  We used pillsbury sugar cookie dough and made personal cookie pizzas that we all got to decorate and eat.  My son and husband loved them!

I make one similar to this, but I just use refrigerated sugar cookie dough.  It is so much easier.  I also add Cool Whip to my cream cheese mixture.  This makes it a little lighter tasting if you prefer this.  It's a great summer dessert and so pretty, too.

Very good, very easy, and so pretty! I made this as a birthday treat for my future mother-in-law. I took the shortcut and used Pillsbury sugar cookie dough because I didn't have much time to make this in. I used raspberries, strawberries, mandarin oranges, bananas, kiwi, and grapes. I also used miniature cookie cutters to cut out a few hearts and stars out of kiwi and strawberry to add to the presentation. Turned out very nicely and tasted SO good! :)

This was SO Good!!  My first try at making a fruit pizza. It turned out really good!! Make the cookie crust!! I made the crust in like 2 minutes. So much better then a store bought cookie. I just made a few changes to the filling. I added half of a 3 oz. box of instant vanilla pudding and I added about 2 cups of cool whip/ whip cream.I also microwaved about half of a small jar of strawberry jam until it was liquid, about a minute, and spread that on the cookie before I put the filling on. It was SO yummy!! I will defenitly make this again!!

Fabulous recipe!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and added whip cream and vanilla pudding to the mixture.  I was short on time so I used sugar cookie dough as a crust and it turned out great. Place the pie in the freezer for about an hour prior to putting on the fruit and serving.  It's hard to cut the pie into slices once the fruit is on top so as others suggested either make individual pies or slice the pie into serving sizes prior to putting the fruit on top.

I should have made a pastry cream for the sauce under the fruit... The cream I made for this recipe tasted like the cream you find in a cheese danish, which is a little too sour for my taste.  I loved the recipe though.

I got this recipe from my mom's friend and this recipe is also the reason I started using this website (which is wonderful). I made this fruit pizza for a girl scout meeting and EVERYONE loved it! I use: kiwi, strawberry, bannana, and sometimes canned mandarine oranges.

My husband and I made two of these one day.  It's an incredibly easy recipe.  For one of the batches, we substituted lemon extract for the vanilla extract in the cream cheese mixture.  Really good.  Also, believe it or not, in order to avoid turning on the oven in summer, he baked the sugar-cookie crust on the grill.  He just monitored the temperature on the grill's thermometer.  Everybody loved it!

Fabulous as is!  I don't add Cool Whip to this and used powdered sugar for the white sugar. Thank you to the reviewers who mentioned to cut the pizza before topping it and to make sure the fruit was dry.  Very yummy!  A perfect dessert for a pizza themed dinner I was doing for our small group.  Everyone loved it.

Thank you! I been looking for this recipe since most use store bought pre-made cookie dough, which cost more than just making it from scratch! This is so simple to make and is delicious! Thanks for posting!

This recipe is awesome and you will get many compliments.  What makes it so great compared to other recipes is that it uses a homemade crust and not pre-made cookie dough.

I took this to a party and it was a big hit. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because it was a bit of a pain to make. (I did use store-bough cookie dough.)

I have used this recipe three times over the past summer and have gotten great reviews from the parties I have served it to!  This recipe is very easy to follow with simple instructions; bake the cookie, mix the topping ingredients, spread the topping on the cookie and add fruit. I made a modification to the recipe.  I don’t have a pizza pan so I just used a cookie sheet, which required two rolls of cookie dough, but the amount of ingredients for the topping was plenty. Also, I made a dessert pizza for the Fourth of July, so I used blueberries, strawberries and bananas to design an American flag.  And just recently I went to the Virginia Tech football game, so as a tailgate dessert I used strawberries and mandarin oranges arranged as the VT football logo.  Both desserts were a hit!

This was very good.  I made this for the 4th of July.  I made the cookie out of pre-made cookie dough and cooked a little more "done" so that it would not get soggy as others mentioned.  I used raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries.  I also put some red food coloring in the cream to be extra festive.  Will defintely make again!

This was definitely a 5 star recipe.  I made it for a family party and everyone commented on how good it was.  I made the crust and frosting as directed and used strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis for the fruit topping.  Thanks for a keeper recipe :)

Great recipe! Used 1/2 cup margarine instead of butter and replaced the cream of tartar & baking soda with 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. I use this everytime I make fruit pizza now. My family looooves it!
Also makes a great sugar cookies!

I used kiwi, strawberries, blueberries (halved), (canned) mandarin oranges. It turned out amazingly i read some of the other reviews about cool whip and the dough getting soggy but i overcooked the dough untill it was all golden brown. Then I let it cool entirely before icing it and putting the fruit on. (To prevent from getting soggy i left the mandarin oranges off till the end and when storing it i took them back off)

The recipe was good, but it can be made much simpler! I used the already made sugar cookie dough and rolled it out for the crust.  Then for the frosting, I added 1/2 c. cool whip to the cream cheese mixture. It made it much lighter and more of a refreshing summer dessert.  Use any kind of fruit and enjoy!  YUM and thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a recipe that I have cooked before.  It's GREAT!!!! If you press down the cookie dough after baking the initial 8-10 minutes.  That should help with less sogginess.  The sugar in the icing can be replaced with pwd sugar for a lighter texture. Add a drop of lemon. you can also add flavored kool aid to this for colors and flavor enhacement.

Great easy recipe and always a hit at potlucks. Last time I cooked the (store bought) cookie dough the day before, let it cool & covered it with saran wrap & foil. Worked out great until I was ready to assemble the pizza. Also, typically I cut down on the amount of sugar as it is pretty sweet. But that can be done to fit personal taste!

AMAZING TASTES EXACTLY LIKE THE TART FROM WEGMANS AMAZING AMAZING. i took another reviewer's advise and added a packet of dry pudding mix and it made the icing tastes more fit for a fruit tart instead of a cheesecaky icing. Next time i make it though i think ill prepare the pudding mix and try adding it in so its more like parfait instead of icing but it is amazing mmmmmmMMM! I also doubled the recipie and pressed the dough into a 9x13 glass pan. Just telling you guys if you do that you will need to bake longer and make sure you do because when i did it it came out really really soft because i underbaked it but STILL WAS AMAZING!!!!!!! Also added vanilla extract to the dough, when i doubled the recipie, i added 1 tablespoon. A lOT of icing left over though. Very, Very good. My mom LOVES it. She ate 2 whole pieces in a sitting, and that's saying SOMETHING. seroiusly. Thank you so much. I will NEVER buy fruit tart again.

Fantastic and simple if you use a sugar cookie mix. I used Almond extract instead of vanilla which dressed the flavor up a bit. Will use again and again!

This was very good except I took the advice of others and used the refrigerated sugar cookies and it was wayyyy to sweet for my taste and that's rare.  Next time I will make my own crust.

This is a favorite at my house. We love it with strawberries, kiwi, and blueberries but any fruit would be just as good. YUM!

My family loves this recipe!  The crust is just awesome!  The only thing I do a bit different is make a batch and a half of the 'sauce' - just because we like our sauces!!

People loved this and it was very easy to prepare.  I pre-baked the cookies, pre-made the "frosting" (adding some vanilla pudding mix to the cream cheese) and pre-cut the fruit.  I assembled it all right before a staff meeting and everyone loved it!  Thank you!

Fruit Pizza has been a favorite in my family since I was a kid.  This recipe works perfectly.  There's really not much to it.  And substituting pre-made cookie dough would probably not detract from it, except in my husband's mind, he'd like to know there aren't stray ingredients or preservatives in it.  Making sugar cookie dough is practically foolproof and cheap.  I would recommend reducing the sugar, probably in the cream cheese mixture and/or the cookie dough.  I LOVE sweet desserts, but I could imagine enjoying the sweetness of the fruits more with a less sugary base, so it's probably worth mentioning.

Great recipe. I had to double it to fit my pizza pan. Don't spread the dough to the edge or it will spill over. I drained the fruit well---will make again!

Awesome, I loved the easiness of this recipe.....as per other suggestions I used the sugar cookie mix from the store and had the crust mixed and made in less than 15 minutes.  The icing or "sauce" was a snap to make and I used some fresh fruit and some frozen since not much was in season when I made it in early April......a great and very pretty treat to make for a pot luck, or a kids party or school treat.  I'll make it again definitely!

This was simple to make and very pretty!  I will definitely make again, however; I thought the ingredients didn't blend very well.  It's just cream cheese icing on a sugar cookie with fruit as a topping.

This crust is simple and really tasty; I think I'll use it as my sugar cookie recipe from now on (but add quite a bit more flour to stiffen it up). I used a flat baking stone and the dough ran off the sides a little during baking but it wasn't disastrous - I just trimmed the edges and ate the trimmings! I used only 1/3 cup of sugar in the topping and folded about a cup of Cool Whip into it after whipping the cream cheese mixture. Made it light and fluffy and probably slightly firmer.  All in all an easy and delicious dessert.

Cookie dough is so easy to make that it's worth making than buying dough from the store.  I placed the dough on a pizza stone and it turned out great.  Made a good 16" pizza.  Added fresh thinly sliced peaches, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

excellent and so easy.  everyone loved it and had many requests since.  I buy the cookie dough at store and use a bag of frozen mixed berries and the contrast between the sweet and tart is great!  Also, for the forth I made one in the shape of flag and then decorated with the blueberries, strawberries and raspberries to look like flag.

This was awesome!  I agree that the dough was too soft and hard to spread on the pan but it was worth the fuss.  I baked the crust the night before, frosted it and stuck it in the fridge and didn't have any problem with a soggy crust the next day--the chilled cream cheese layer seemed to keep the fruit juices from penetrating.

I had this before at a party and loved it. I found this recipe and hoped it would be similar. I tried it twice and the second time came out MUCH better. I doubled the cream cheese mixture and also added a glaze made from the following:
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp. cornstarch
Mix all ingredients together and boil for a few minutes. Cool, pur over fruit and then refrigerate. 

I really think the glaze brought it all together. Super easy recipe and very good!

This was a HIT!  Loved it!  Make the homemade cookie crust it's well worth it, you'll be glad you did!  For fruit I simply used strawberries, blueberries and kiwi (the kiwi is a must).  The first time I made this I used strawberry glaze and didn't care for it, it's not necessary on this dessert.  It's fab with just the fruit.  MAKE THIS YOU'LL LOVE IT!  Thanks Anne.

This is great!!  I am not a big fruit eater but this is something I could eat often!  I used 1/2 package of vanilla pudding as suggested by someone else in the "sauce" of the pizza.  It is good with it but it really made the it very thick and kind of sticky. That made it a little harder to spread but not too much so.  I did use the refrigerated cookie dough.  It was good but homemade is always better.  I will definetely make this often!!  It's great for summer parties.

This was the hit of the party. Everyone wanted more. I used fresh cherries, strawberries,kiwi and bananas. I also used fat free strawberry cream cheese and it was a great touch.  Will definately make this again!!

WOW!  What a huge hit.  I used pre-made cookie dough for the crust-  I cut it into about 20 slices, rolled them onto a 14-inch round pizza pan.  I sprayed lightly with Pam before putting the dough on and that seemed to help when it came time to serve. It baked perfectly-  I did not ice it until the following day.  Added fruit, chilled for 3 hours, and then served at an office party.  It was a favorite of everyone and they are already asking when I will make another one.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Try using cresent rolls shaped into a circle on a solid baking sheet. Don't use the pizza pans with holes you will never get it off the sheet.  Bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes.  This is a quick easy crust and it isn't quite as sweet as the cookie.

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I could hardly get enough. I made it for my son's 1st birthday, and I anticipate this will be a regular birthday tradition in our house. 

Next time I will make a thicker layer of fruit. Some of the fruit that I cut thinly ended up being too thin.

Very disappointed. Making this for a baby shower for tomorrow! So glad I am making it tonight instead of tomorrow so I have time to come up with an alternate. The dough was way too sticky. It was very difficult to work with. Not only did it stick to the pan so I can't use it, the dough has a weird taste to it. Frantically found a new recipe and it's working out much better.

This was a huge hit at work. I used refrigerated sugar cookie dough and added cool whip to the frosting. This is very sweet! The frosting is amazing, but again, extremely sweet.

Great recipe but made a few changes.  I used whole wheat flour instead and added cinnamon and no baking soda,  It came out wonderful.  I topped it with kiwi, strawberries and blueberries.  I did change the cream as others suggested and used half light cream cheese and half light cool whip.  I took it to a meeting and five minutes after putting it on the table there was a tiny piece left. I got so many compliments on it. It was a great stroke to the ego, especially for someone who is not good at baking of any type.

This ended up being really great! The first time I made it I had a hard time getting the dough all the way to the edge of the pizza pan, so I added some extra dough (I had extra because I had doubled the recipe to make two pizzas). Big mistake. The cookie really spread out and ran over the edges of pan. So it's fine to leave an inch or so around the edge of the pan with no cookie dough as the cookie does expand. I made this for my teen-aged youth group and they loved it! They helped cut up the toppings and decorate the pizza. It is a bit hard to get the slices off the pan, but we managed.

I think this would have been better if we had eaten it all in one day. It became soggy very quickly. I did like the lemon glaze, but it was messy and made it soggier faster. I would definitely make this again, but most likely for a bunch of people, not as a snack for my husband and I.

This recipe was delicious. We made no changes and it turned out perfectly. It was simple to make, my 3 young children (5, 3.5, 23mths) helped with all the steps (except for cutting the fruit and that is because we were in a hurry). The leftovers kept well in the refrigerator over night and it tasted just as good. We used strawberries, bananas and grapes. Highly recommended.

Perhaps this would have turned out better had I made the original crust instead of using a pre-packaged sugar cookie roll.  The crust was very soggy and it was too sweet.  The fruit was good but I would not make this again.

Great recipe for a fruit pizza from scratch... tasted really good... you can use what ever toppings you have on hand.... i added 4 oz of whipped topping to the "sauce" I also followed other reviewers suggestions by using wax paper to flatten out the dough... froze the dough and "sauce" cut it then put the toppings on... very very good just take your time decorating

This is wonderful! Not hard to make and tastes so good! You can use whatever fruit you want and you could spread it out for less fruit or pack it on for lots.  Get creative! Also, it will keep nicely in the fridge for a few days.

If you don't have much time.  This recipe works really well if you use premade sugar cookie dough from the store.  Also, you can use flavored cream cheese like Strawberry.  Very good that way!  Love this recipe!!

This dessert is really delicious. Brought it to work for a bithday celebration intstead of cake and it was really a hit.  I used different fruit that I had on hand and the combination of blueberries, strawberries, tangerines, and bannanas was perfect...Yummy:)

YUM! We didn't have the right pan, so we divided it into two glass dishes (maybe 6x10"??). The crust was thick but delicious. All the kids at my daughter's 5th birthday asked for seconds! Success!

I used 1/2 the sugar,  whole grain flour (white wheat and spelt) and added 2 tsp. powdered ginger for a little kick.  I used whipping cream and just a dash of vanilla and sugar instead of cream cheese.  No one missed the missing carbs.  With fresh fruit you just can't go wrong.

I took this to a breakfast potluck today and it received rave reviews!  Like everyone else I used packaged sugar cookie mix (Betty Crocker), I couldn't find the already prepared stuff. A small box of cream of tarter was just over $4.00 and I could buy the packages of mix for less.  LOL  Anyhow, I mixed in a cup of cool whip with the cream cheese and sugar and used strawberries, kiwis, blackberries, pineapple, and peaches as the topping.  It turned out great and was relatively easy to make.  Will definitely make again!

I'm going to give it 5 stars b/c if I had followed the recipe it probably would have been great, but I was in a hurry.  I used snickerdoodle premade cookie dough b/c the store was out of regular sugar cookies.  I also didn't rool it out, they were cut up squares and I just used them and made individual pizzas.  Instead of sugar I used splenda but ended up added 2 tablespoons of regular sugar to make it a little sweeter.  And for the fruit I was running through the grocery store and the frozen section was closer so I grabbed a bag of frozen strawberries, blueberries and raspberries and let them thaw while I made the rest.  It was pretty good.. the kids liked it. I'm more discriminating though so next time I'll follow the recipe!

This desert got mixed reviews.  I didn't like it.  The crust was too sweet and greasy.  I would have preferred a crust more tart-like, I guess.  But my husband and some of the kids enjoyed it.  I made it on a 9x13 cookie pan and layered the fruit to look like an American flag.  It looked cute, but I'll be looking for a new crust recipe.

My 10 year old daughter made this today and she had a lot of fun making it. We used strawberries, kiwi, grapes, blueberries and raspberries.  We were hoping to have some left since there were a lot of people at the party we took it too but not a drop was left!

Delicious!!! One of my favourite desserts! I just made it for the first time yesterday, and I accidentally used a pie pan instead of a pizza pan so the cookie and cream cheese layers were very thick, which I actually prefer - try it if you're a texture person. Just make sure you cut it into smaller pieces ;)

I expected a lot from this recipe because of the five stars, but when I tried them I was terribly disappointed. The sweetness of the cookie crust and the cream cheese mixture overpowered the fruits, which were already very sweet. With a fruit pizza, in my opinion, the sweetness should come from the fruit with a pie-like, more salty crust that contrasts the fruit. I ended up making a pie crust and using whipped cream in place of the cream cheese mixture, then I just took the fruit from the first pizza, cleaned off the cream cheese, and added it to the new one. It tasted much more crisp and fresh. My younger brothers preferred the overpoweringly sweet first version but I think a more mature taste will prefer a crisper, fresher taste. Don't waste perfectly good fruit on this recipe; I don't plan to again.

I thought this was great, very similar to the fruit pizza recipe I used to make, but fabulous.  Since I was taking it to a gathering, I thought it less messy to make "tarts" out of it.  I used mini tart muffin wrappers and sprayed with non-stick spray.  I put a little glop of the crust mixture in the bottom and baked until done.  I then put the next layer mixture on top (I added some vanilla pudding mix and used a little less sugar....I only had the dark vanilla so it got kinda dark and I wanted to lighten it up, hence the pudding mix- which actually tasted really yummy).  I then cut up tiny pieces of fruit (kiwi, strawberries, raspberries, mandarin oranges) and put on each little tart.  It was super handy and bite size, thus eliminating the mess.  It worked out so nicely that it's going to be how I always make my fruit pizza now, much less mess!

I made this to take to work, and it was a hit. I used a cookie sheet and doubled the cookie recipe to have more servings. I took a few hints from others and this pizza sat out for hours with no sogginess. Before baking the cookie, I spread a thin layer of rasberry jam, and then baked till brown. I used a tub of strawberry creme cheese, marshmallow fluff and cool whip for the sauce. I used kiwi, blueberrys and strawberries. I took the cookie with the sauce on it to work, refrigerated it for two hours, and then put it together. It help up very well. I had left over fruit and sauce, so the next day I layed the spread out with cups and spoons, and my coworkers ate it up! 

Thanks,
Doris

This was great. I added Cool Whip in the cream cheese mixture to make it lighter, and the total was more than enough to make two pizzas. It doesn't save very well - we refrigerated the extra of the second pizza, but the sugar cookie part got pretty soft.

This recipe was such a hit, my daughter wants me to make this for her birthday cake on Sunday.  I made once before and I too would agree with others to cut down on the sugar a bit.  I am going to try and use only 1/2 a cup for the cookie part and 1/4 cup for the sauce.  Last time I added about 1/2 the package of vanilla pudding mix and about 1/4 cup milk to thin out the sauce a little.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!!!

Overall was a good recipe.  I didn't care for the crust so much, but everyone loved the "cream sauce".  I used strawberries, kiwi, fresh peach and some canned pineapple as I need to juice to make the glaze.  Brought home an empty dish.

This was so good, easy, and really pretty. I did use my own sugar cookie recipe, which is pretty much the same except it has 3/4 cup more flour, half brown sugar and half white sugar for the sugar and no cream of tartar. Everything else I did exactly the same and I used strawberries and kiwi for my fruit. It was great.

The cookie base for this pizza was DELICIOUS. I did not have any cream of tartar, so I replaced the baking soda and cream of tartar with 2tsp baking powder. For the frosting I added vanilla pudding mix as suggested by some of the comments, but I found it too vanilla-y. Luckily it was covered by the fruit, but next time I think I will stick to the original recipe.

Really amazing! I cooked mine without the cream of tartar, since this is hard to find in Japan, but it still turned out great. Thank you~

I used a store bought crust.  It was a little too sweet.  Maybe next time I will use the crust recipe here.

Absolutely delicious! Plus, it's really fun to make. The crust mixed together differently than I expected (it began to flake in the bowl) but it turned out wonderfully. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Luckily I tasted the cream cheese mixture before adding all the sugar because I only used 1/4 cup, along with neufatchel cheese instead of cream cheese to cut down on fat.  Spread was plenty for two pizzas!  I used kiwis, raspberries, and strawberries and it was delicious!

Excellent!  Easy recipe and the dough expands nicely to fill the pizza stone.  The taste is great.  It is easy enough that I would definitely do this rather than buy pre-made dough.  I think I might try next time with a brownie bottom or put a layer of chocolate before the cream cheese mixture.  All in all, very good!

this was pretty good.  I frosted the pizza and then cut it into pieces and kept it in the fridge for a few days.  I added friut to it when I wanted to eat a piece.

Really good recipe. I microwaved about half a jar of strawberry preserves until it was liquid and drizzled it over the top to add another layer of flavor.

The fruit pizza looked and tasted great.  I used white sugar in the frosting and didn't find it to be grainy as other reviewers posted.  I beat the frosting for a long time so maybe that dissolved the sugar.

Excellent. Only thing I did different was used powdered sugar instead of white sugar in the cream cheese mixture. Used strawberries and blueberries for my fruit. My husband already wants me to make another one.

I loved this recipe!  I disagree that using store bought cookie dough tastes the same.  The crust is so simple to make, it's worth it. I added a little extra cream cheese mixture and glazed the fruit. I took this to a 4th of July barbecue and it went long before any other dessert was even touched.  So easy!

Easy and beautiful dessert to make!  Made for Easter and everyone LOVED the way it looked AND tasted!  I will always use the premade easy cookie dough that you can just roll out.  I also cut down a little bit on the sugar as husband said first one was a BIT too sweet.  Any fruit works well- kiwi and strawberries give beautiful presentation.

This recipe is OUT OF THIS WORLD. It's a favorite with kids and adults like. Almost too easy to be so good. The fruit cost is about the only downside that I find. This is definately my favorite recipe on this website so far. Thanks

I used this recipe for a get together, and everyone loved it. I put out a tray of sliced fruit so that they could "make their own fruit pizza". I didn't use the cream of tartar in the dough, but it still turned out great. I also used flavored cream cheese on top, instead of the plain.

Used this recipe for a science project.  We did the solar system and used fruit for the "planets" and "stars".  What a great way to get an "A" on your project and the kids get a treat and my son got the thumbs up from all his buddies!
I froze the crust with the sauce for a couple of hours.  Then cut it into pieces before assembling the solar system on top.  What a great recipe.   I think next time we'll use a cheese pizza as our universe!!;)

Delicious!  Although I feel kind of bad because I didn't follow the recipe... it ended up not being Anne's recipe at all, but it was a great foundation to build on!  I substituted pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough; I also substituted for the cream cheese - the store was out of plain cream cheese (can you believe it?) so I bought some Berry-flavored spreadable light cream cheese.  Oh, it was delicious!  And I topped with canned pineapple slices (cut in half), fresh mandarin orange slices, sliced fresh kiwi, red seedless grapes, and banana.  It looked pretty and professional and was easy to cut, serve, and fun to eat!  Everyone (adults and kids) enjoyed this yummy dessert pizza.  5 stars!!!!

I used pre made sugar cookie dough and a large pizza pan so I doubled the recipe. It was great! I didn’t have a great selection of fruits so I ended up just using strawberries but I also put strawberry glaze on which added a beautiful red color and it looked wonderful. Everyone loved it!

This was a blast, I used it in my junior (11th grade) speech class, for our final exam we had to do a demonstration speech, I had never made this before, the actual day, and it went over so well, everyone wanted a copy of the recipe, and the demonstrations were student graded, and I received a 100% from all 20 of my peers.

I would suggest adding fruit just before serving.  I found that the juices from the fruit make the cookie very soggy.

I just made this recipe for my church this weekend, and though I was sick and couldn't give it to them in person, they are all raving about it, and some want the recipe!  It was really fun and easy to make.  At first, the dough didn't promise a good cookie (it was on the pasty side), but when it was all done and cooked, it was actually perfect!

We really like this "pizza" especially with fresh strawberries and strawberry glaze.  I, too, found the crust very sticky when putting it into pan.  I used a round pizza pan and the dough ran out in the oven when baking. Next time I'll use a large rectangle pan.

Made this for Mother's Day gathering.  Made the dough as directed, except didn't
add the cream of tarter, didn't have any, and at midnight I wasn't running to the
store for it.  This could have been why it didn't really turn out too good.  It stuck
to the pizza pan, I used a deep dish pizza pan.  It seemed as thought the sides
were getting too brown before the middle was done.  It was a little doughing in
the middle, but remaining was good, a little on the sweet side, but it was a hit
with the kids.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I tried the pizza and it is amazing! great taste and very easy! Also, I personally don't believe in store bought cookie dough, so I'm very happy that this dough was from scratch!

I liked the overall look of the pizza for 4th of JUly but felt the crust of the cookie was a bit crumbly and not very tasty. There are better crusts out there for this type of dessert

I made this at school, a few days after at home, and at a family gathering. I love it, and everyone else does! But when making this, you have to be really careful to not roll it out too much. It gets oily, and you do want to grease the pan still though. Best fruit pizza recipe! And I love making it from scratch!

Turned out great! Thanks so much. Absolutely delicious and exactly what I was craving. I didn't have any cream of tartar on me, so I substituted with 1-1/2 tsp baking powder. :)

i disagree about the suggestion of packaged cookie dough... even more since this is a very quick and easy dough recipe- one bowl and 2 mixing prongs are hardly a mess...this was super quick and easy- the only things that took a while was waiting for the cookie to cool down and to chill the whole pizza later

Excellent!! Worked beautifully in a stoneware bar pan. I have prepared several and it usually takes about 12-14 minutes. Serves 18 squares nicely. I only use fruits that do not brown, mostly strawberries, pineapple, kiwi, mandarins oranges and blueberries.  I steer clear of bananas because they turn brown so quick. Apricots, plums and peaches get yucky too in the unlikely chances if leftovers! I also cut the pizza after the cream cheese kayer is put on and before the fruit, this mskes it prettier to serve.Definitely a keeper.

Gave it four stars because I liked the idea and the crust and the look- and the fruit- but I wasn't crazy crazy about the cream cheese topping- I did use confectioners sugar and added a little cool whip but I think next time I may go completely with cool whip?  That being said- I have 4 girls- my one loved the frosting but the other 3 weren't crazy about it- The cookie crust turned out perfect.  And it looked amazing too :)

Made this tonight after my son told me his class was having a pizza party tomorrow which also includes dessert pizza. Since he has allergies, we have to make almost everything from scratch. This was easy; not time-consuming, and well worth every minute! The flavor of the crust is just perfect - I don't like it when the crust is too sweet. I ended up baking it for the full 10 minutes. The cream cheese and sugar layer is also just the right amount of both. I then topped part of the pizza with sauteed green apples (1/2 stick butter plus loads of cinnamon in a skillet with two green apples. This only covers about 1/4 of the pizza). And the remaining pizza was topped with a Trader Joe's mixture of frozen strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. Good stuff! Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it's cold by me so it's hard to come by fruit.  I used one bag of frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries) and put it in a pan with about a tablespoon of sugar.  Once it made a liquid, I drained the fruit, set it aside and to the pan with the liquids, I added a tsp. of corn starch to thicken.  Once it was completely cooled, I added it over the pie.  Next time, I would not add sugar to the cream cheese mixture because the topping I made is sweet and I'd make a smaller pie and either double the cream cheese mixture so you can taste it.

Delicious and simple to make, I will definitely be making this recipe again.  I made mine with raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, with some mini chocolate chips for a little extra sweetness. Came out perfect.

Easy and delicious! I took it into work and my co-workers had a third of it gone by 9am! It didn't even make it past lunch time! They loved it so much I made another one two days later. Only thing I did differently was used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (1/3 less fat!). My co-workers said it's the best dessert I've ever made, which is saying a lot since I bake 2-3 times a week! I'm sure I'll be making this again and again!

This is a terrific summer dessert! I used the sugar cookie crust. I also took the advice of some reviewers by adding a little Cool Whip to the cream cheese and partially freezing it before adding fresh fruit. It was not soggy at all and kept well in the fridge the next day. Thanks!

Pretty much a foolproof recipe!  I make it in a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper- getting the "pieces" of pizza out is a breeze!  I usually have to press the cookie dough crust by hand to make it reach everywhere.  Every time I make this recipe, everyone loves it.

I used a pre-made cookie dough on mine to make things easier on myself. The pizza was great, with the addition of about 6-8 oz of whipped topping in with the cream cheese and powdered sugar. It was much lighter and tasted better than it did without the whipped topping. Nice base for creativity, though!

I made this for the 4th but used packaged  sugar cookie dough mix and added 1/2 cup finely chopped  toasted pecans into the dry mix before mixing  with egg and softened butter.  I also folded a half container of cool whip into the cream cheese mixture and reduced the sugar a little bit. The pecans gave it a terrific flavor!

This is AMAZING!! It's a giant sugar cookie covered in cream cheese, topped with fruit. How can it NOT taste amazing! I followed the recipe exactly; the only thing I changed was using 3/4 cup powdered sugar in the cream cheese frosting. I used blueberries and strawberries for the topping. Everyone in my family kept coming back for seconds and thirds--would DEFINITELY make this again!!

I love fruit pizza, but I was nervous making this recipe as my husband isn't a big sugar cookie fan.  But we both loved it!  I made it as is but in a 9x13 baking pan since I don't have a pizza pan.  I just had to bake it longer.  I also added a little almond extract to the frosting and it turned out great.  This was very simple to make and I will be making it again!

I doubled the recipe and cooked them in 2- 12x8 inch pans for a semi- formal dinner party. EVERYONE RAVED!!! I topped them with pineapple, strawberries, and blueberries. No problem with sogginess.

Excellent recipe.  Im all about short cuts, so purchase the premade sugar cookie dough in a roll, let it reach room temp-then press it into the pan.  Very easy if you are too busy to make the sugar cookie from scratch :)

I simplifed and used a package of refrigerated sugar cookie dough; and for the fruit I used strawberries, kiwi and blackberries. Delicious! And very pretty! I plan to make it with strawberries, blueberries and raspberries to take to the 4th of July street party.

I've made this twice. The first time I used prepackaged Pillsbury dough and regular soft cream cheese. I then tried with the store brand dough and fat free cream cheese and it wasn't as good as the first attempt.

Delicious!  I was requested to bring something light to a luncheon, and this was perfect!  I made a few changes: added a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar (instead of white sugar), half a tub of cool whip, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. of almond extract.  I also used refrigerated cookie dough and made them into cookies - I thought it would be easier to eat that way.  I baked the cookies until they were light brown to avoid the sogginess factor.  They were sitting about 2 hours before we ate them and the cookies were slightly soft, but still good.  I used strawberries, kiwi and blueberries.  They turned out beautiful and got rave reviews.

Delicious! I made this with store-bought dough, which is much easier-- it's great! I've made this as a large round pizza and again as mini cookie-sized pizzas. You can be really creative with how you arrange the fruit- this is almost too pretty to eat, and the frosting is to-die-for!

The flavors are pretty good, but it got soggy REALLY fast!  We cut the crust into personal ducky shapped pieces for a baby shower this weekend.  We didn't put anything on the cookie crusts until the last minute.  Within an hour they were already getting soggy!  The cookie part also had a bit of an after taste.  I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

This was a great dessert.  I was surprised though by how sticky the dough was (just added some flour to roll out).  I split the dough into two batches and the pizzas turned out a perfect size to keep and one to share.  My husband is already requesting me make this again with his football team logo on it.  Yum!

I made this for a Memorial Day family cookout and everybody raved over how wonderful it was!! I will definitely be making this again!! I did use the store bought sugar cookie dough and added about a 1/4 container of cool whip to the topping mixture and it was just so yummy! I also love the many different ways the cookie can be shaped and decorated with different fruits for different looks and tastes - I made an american flag with blueberries and strawberries (see in photos)

The first time I made this, I made the crust from scratch.  The second time I made this I was extremely short on time so I just used refrigerated sugar cookie dough and I think it tasted just as good, if not better.  Don't waste your time making the cookie crust from scratch.  I do use powdered sugar in the topping and add some cool-whip.  UPDATE: The next time I made this, I ran out of sugar cookie dough so I used chocolate chip cookie dough.  That was out of this world delicious.

The whole family loved it!  I had to cook the crust much longer than it called for, at least 20 minutes (waited for the sides to turn golden brown).  I only used strawberries and blackberries.  It was great.

Yum! I made this as for Kindergarten Cooking Lab and it was easy to prepare. It tasted so good that the teachers and moms were coming back for more. I will definitely make this again! I used the ready made cookie dough and for the fruit: Strawberries, Blueberries,Kiwi and Mandarin Oranges.

I would give this recipe five stars for taste, but I'm giving it four because it was almost impossible to spread the crust into the pan to bake!  It was incredibly sticky and I even tried using wax paper coated in butter flavored cooking spray to spread it out but it stuck to that too!  That is my only problem with the recipe and it was a big hit at our small group get together; I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.  I also mixed about 3 ounces of whipped topping into the cream mixture and it tasted great!

What a hit. The church volunteers loved this recipe. I also found other creative uses for the cookie crust. I t is very versatile, such as being topped with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

Mmmmmmmmmm...I love this recipe!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup in the dough and to 1/3 cup in the cream cheese.  It was PLENTY sweet when topped with strawberries, blueberries, and red grapes.  I also added 1 tablespoon of 1/2&1/2 to the cream cheese to make it easier to spread.  I don't like store-bought sugar cookies so I did make the crust using this recipe.  I pressed it into a large pizza pan with a little flour sprinkled over to cut down on the sticky factor.  So good...very chewy and delicious.  I added pink food coloring to the cream cheese for Valentine's Day.  YUM!

I have made this fruit pizza several times and I always get rave reviews.  I always have to bake the cookie longer than suggested, but I like mine a little crispier.  I love pineapple to top it with pineapples, strawberries, kiwis and grapes. One recommendations I would make is pouring 1-2 tbsp of pineapple juice in the cream cheese topping, it makes it a little smoother and adds a nice flavor.

Great! I made mine into individual pizzas. I cheated and bought a roll of refrigerated sugar cookie dough, sliced and baked. I then used this cream cheese icing on each, and can make many variations depending on fruits available.

This was super yummy.  A nice refreshing dessert for summer. I made the crust in a square brownie pan because I didn't have a pizza pan.  I used all the sugar as stated in the recipe and found the cream cheese mixture to have just the right sweetness.  I beat it on high speed for a while and didn't have any problem with a granulated texture.  I topped the crust with strawberry sundae topping before baking.  I used raspberries, bananas, blueberries and strawberries.  5 people ate 12 large slices.  That's how delicious it was.  I will defnitely make this again and again.

Excllent recipe!  The homemade cookie crust is great.  I did add a package of vanilla pudding mix to the frosting.  I made 2 and took them to my daughter's preschool graduation and they were one of the first things that was GONE from the buffet table!

thought the fruit would not be sweet enough compared to the cream, but I kept coming back to it over the brownies and other desserts. I used frozen mixed berries and frozen peaches. Once they defrosted the juice spilled easily over the side of the pan (on my car) but tasted great!

I thought this was excellent.  I am glad I found a recipe for fruit pizza from scratch.  I never use store bought dough.  I topped mine with grapes, strawberries and kiwi.  It looked very pretty, was easy to serve, and well liked by everyone.

This got me RAVE reviews at my Easter dinner. It looked stunning, and I was afraid it would be all looks and no substance - but I was wrong! I actually mixed the cream cheese with some whipped cream (i made fresh whipped cream) and still thought it was a little cream cheesey plain, but it was wonderful with the cookie and fruit topping. I will absolutly be making this showstopper again!

FABULOUS!!  VERY YUMMY!!  I think making your own dough is actually better and it doesn't take more than 2 minutes to mix!!  I had more compliments on the homemade dough than the pre-made dough... probably because I could tell everyone I made it from scratch but eitherway!!  It's fantastic and I think everyone will love it!!

This is a beautiful dessert and tastes great too!!  I used kiwi, strawberry and madarin oranges.  Imade this the night before and let it sit in the fridge over night.   Although I dried the fruit very well on paper towels there was pink juice on it the next morning.  The juice had jellied a little so I drizzled chocolate sauce over it and the juice wasn't noticable.  Next time I think I might try adding some mini chocolate chips in the dough.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed it.  I was a little confused when the recipe said to press dough into pan.  The dough is not really thick enough to press.  I had to spread mine into the pan.  I wasn't sure I made it right because of that, but it turned out great!

yum, yum, yum!  what a great dessert!!  my family gobbled this up.  i used fat free cream cheese and equal by the spoonful for the topping, and it seemed to come apart in the fridge.  i would reccomend using sugar for that part.  for my topping, i used kiwi, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, bananas, grapes, and nectarines.  i also used store-bought sugar dough to make the process a little quicker with less dishes.  the crust baked up more than i thought it would but it was a welcome surprise!  this didn't last long in my house!

I have been making this for years and am finally getting around to publicly giving it the five star review it has always deserved! I have brought this to many events and everyone always raves about how great tastes and looks— and they always refuse to believe me when I insist how easy it is! Instead of spending time making the dough from scratch (I use pre-made as suggested by many) I choose to spend my time on the presentation— neatly arranging circles of varying (colors of) fruit from the inside-out & even sometimes dropping in some food coloring into the frosting. Truly spectacular!

WONDERFUL AND EAAASY!!! 
I didn't put any vanilla extract in my frosting and used raspberries, strawberries, bananas, mandarin oranges, grapes, and peaches. This was a HUGE hit at my family reunion, all ages LOVED it!!

Very Good!
I didn't have any CREAM OF TARTER so I instead omitted the Baking Soda and Cream of Tarter and used 2 tsp of baking powder.  It rose up pretty good and tasted great :)  
Will deffinately make this one again

the crust took like 20 minutes to make, and even still it was soggy. Thats weird because our oven is a really hot one, and we usually need to put things in for less time. It was really good though, I especially liked the sauce*

My husband, who can't stand cream cheese, asked for seconds! I used refigerated sugar cookie dough because I was in a hurry. Added kiwi, fresh pineapple, bananas, red grapes (cut in half) canned peaches (well drained), chopped dates and cranberries.  Yummy!!

Used refrigerated choc. chip cookie dough and cooked about 12 min. Mixed cream cheese, cool whip and 2 tsp. vanilla. Added kiwi, blueberries, pineapple, mandarin oranges and pomegranite seeds. Drizzled with chocolate.  A beautiful presentation. Everyone loved it.  Not soggy a day later.    Fantastic recipe

This recipe is awesome. I took it to a work potluck and everyone raved about it. This was after it had been in the fridge overnight (no soggy crust). I added about 1/4 cup of Cool Whip to the cream cheese mixture. Fabulous.

I'm lazy; I just bought a tube of sugar cookie dough.  But the cream cheese "frosting" is what made this recipe wonderful!  Our Bible Study devoured it in an evening!

I did a "trial run" last night of this recipe in preparation for the Fourth of July with strawberries and blueberries. A really yummy idea but the cream cheese topping is much too sweet.  The next time I make this I will use half the amount of sugar called for. Also, I will try using lemon juice in place of the vanilla.  My husband (who's not a big dessert fan) did go back for seconds, though!

Perfect!  I doubled this recipe right off the bat and had no problems at all.  I made it for my daughters 6th birthday party and it was a bigger hit than the princess cake we ordered!  My suggestion is for everyone to try it!  Thanks Anne!

(Go the easy route and buy the storebought refrig. cookie dough - then its a snap) I made this for a family reunion, and it was a big hit.  I found it a little sweet myself, so next time I'm going to cut the sugar in half.  Very pretty and easy dessert.  Thank you!

I had made this recipe years ago and forgotten about it.  As I was browsing this site (OMG I LOVE THIS SITE hehe), I noticed it and had to make it again.  As always, it was easy, beautiful and delicious.  I will make this for my childbirth class I have coming up.. they'll love it too I'm sure.  =)

This is not a recipe I would normally make, but I did and the kids loved it; so did the adults.

I used store-bought cookie dough and added some sour cream to the cream cheese mixture.  Used strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries.

We had a dessert contest at my office and this recipe went up against luscious chocolate cheesecakes, candy bar pies and this recipe took first prize!!! Everyone loved it.  Although it takes a little time to cut up the fruit, it is worth it! Presentation is limitless, can use all different kinds of fruit - its beautiful as well as delicious.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE! I REALLY LIKED THE CRUST. IF YOU FIND YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE SPREADING THE DOUGH TRY USING THE INSIDE BOTTOM PART OF YOUR HAND. THIS REALLY WORKED WELL FOR ME. THIS WAS A HIT WITH MY HUSBAND.

Fabulous recipe!!  I made this for our "Thursday Night Dinner Club," a group of (up to 18 attend) family and friends that we dine with every "Thursday night."  It's a mixture of kids and adults and this received rave reviews!  One descerning diner rated it in his top five desserts and we have been doing this for 8 years now.  It was also easy to make!  I made the cookie dough, cream cheese mixture and chopped fruit ahead and put it all together just before serving.  I don't know how well it will store once assembled, but that wasn't a problem since there weren't any leftovers!

This is so good! I made it for a large gathering and it went so fast that I had to promise to make it again. It takes a little effort to spread the dough in the pan, but the rest is easy. I would also run a large spatula under the baked cookie to be sure it comes loose from the pan.

This was a big hit for the 4th. Instead of putting all the ingredients together for the frosting, I just used cream cheese and cool wip. Very succesfull, and easy. I then used frozen blueberries and reaspberries to get the 4th of July coloring. I sprinkled Coconut on top just for fun. Then I froze it for and hour beofre serving, and it was eaten before all the other foods there.

This is great when you do the fruit topping, but I've done it with other things too to make a "pizza cookie" that the kids really like.  Try chocolate frosting with m&ms!  

Only one comment--the dough is very sticky.  I've had to flour my hands and the dough when pressing it into the pizza pan.

Delicious!  I wish the crust had been crunchier. I baked it for 14 minutes until golden brown all over.  I used 2 bananas, 2 small boxes of blueberries, and 1 lb. of strawberries.

Somehow while trying to find the perfect dinner for Sunday night My baby K shouted out fruit pizza lol ... within seconds we found this recipe and the choice was made to have desert for dinner ! We fast tracked the recipe with pillsburry sugar cookie dough and added banana. Used the method for the topping and boom . Our masterpiece was complete! Bottom line is I love this app and I love this recipe!

Fast, easy and delicious!  Have made many times and always double the dough portion to spread easily and evenly onto  a 13x9 pan.   Favorite fruit combinations include strawberries, bananas, blueberries and kiwi.

The only changes I made were homemade sugar cookie recipe and adding homemade whipped cream to the cream cheese topping to make it a bit fluffier and easier to spread.

I made several changes... I used the pillsbury ready made cookie dough... needed to bake it way longer than planned. I used the neufchatel reduced fat cheese & stevia instead of sugar. Strawberries & Blueberries. Turned out excellent, just the cookie dough needed to be baked longer. Will definitely make again & try to make a lower carb "sugar cookie dough". I just ran out of time... everyone, especially the kiddos loved it!

I used 1/2 cup sugar in crust, and 1/4 cup sugar in filling. Plenty of sugar as fruit has its own sugar, and this was fed to dietetics that did not want the sugar. I also put 4 oz. of cool whip in filling. Makes filling creamier. Everyone loved it and wants the recipe as I made it. The best cookie dough I have made for a fruit pizza. I make everything from scratch.

This was a great recipe! I have two pieces of advice. First, use parchment paper to slide it off the sheet pan for a nice presentation. I trimmed the sides to get a perfect American Flag shape with a bread knife once off the pan. Second, a little overdone (golden) is better than underdone since the cream cheese frosting softens the cookie. Even my crispy edges became perfect and more chewy after a bit of time under the spread. My friends loved it.

I used the  pre-made cookie dough and I used strawberries, blueberries, nectarines, kiwis and mandarin oranges. Another reviewer said to mix whipped topping with the cream cheese and 2 tsp. of vanilla. Perfect! Easy & delicious!

My mom used to make fruit pizza so I thought I would give it a go for a brunch with friends. I thought it turned out great. I only used 1/2 cup sugar in the crust (the ingredients state this amount). I used powdered sugar for the "sauce" to help it mix in easier, and I also added about 1/2 cup whipped cream.  Kiwis, strawberries, bananas, peaches. It was still plenty sweet but all my friends loved it. My husband was skeptical at first, but he ended up eating the biggest portion from it. It made a pretty presentation. It doesn't keep extremely well though - it was okay after 5 hours or so, but definitely softer than when first made even though it was kept in the fridge.

It's so easy to make! I used the Pillsbury sugar cookie dough - already made. I bought some blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, 2 kiwi and chocolate chips. 1. squish dough on pizza pan & bake 8 min. 2. mix a box of cream cheese, 1/2 c sugar and vanilla & mix. Spread & top with fruit. I can make it on the go in 30-45 minutes & looks so impressive. The combo of sweet and sour is a winner.

Super yummy.  I made these for my 4 year old's birthday snack at school.  I made mini cook pizzas by simply scooping the dough out like cookie dough.  I topped mine with a whipping cream, cream cheese and powdered sugar icing.  The kids loved them and my family enjoyed the extras.

I have made this before but using a different recipe.  This was by far way better.  The other recipe is very doughy, this one came out perfect!  It was eaten right up by the 7 of us.  I would say it would serve 8.

This is a great recipe with no changes.  I've made it for several occasions, it always gets rave reviews.  People especially like the cookie base, I think it's the cream of tartar they like.  I would not be opposed to using premade cookie dough for a substitute if short of time but it isn't that time consuming to make this dough.

This turned out really good.  I had everything on hand which is a big plus.  I used this to make and american flag fruit pizza as I had blueberries and strawberries.  I felt this was the perfect desert to make this weekend after the horrible officer shooting that took place here in Dallas just days ago.

After making it once, I would keep the frosting amount the same and increase dough by 50% to 100%, maybe easiest to double to fit in a 9 by 13 bar pan.  Tasted good, the crust was not too sweet.

I made these as individual little pizzas for my daughter's 3rd grade class and they were a hit.  I doubled the cookie recipe (there was plenty of cream cheese filling without doubling it) and for some reason, the dough was extremely wet and sticky. The second time I made them, I was careful to be exact on the double measurements and the results were the same. So when I put the dough on parchment paper to roll out, I had to keep adding flour until it was soft and smooth for kneading.  If you want to use cookie cutters, I found it was best to cut the dough while it was still warm but not too cool so that they wouldn't crack.  Cutting them out after baking made fun little leftover cookie "crusts" that my family loves snacking on.  :) When I cut the dough before baking, the shapes did not stay when baked. Loved the filling/frosting. Make sure the fruit is as dry as possible so that the pizza will not be soggy too soon.

I made this for Easter, it was very easy. The most time was cutting the fruit and arranging it as I liked. When I brought it in the house and told the kids I had made a fruit pizza for them, they wanted some right away. The next weekend was my nephews birthday and his request was ... fruit pizza! So it was  a big hit  :)

I made it as written with the addition of 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the cookie.   It's an awesome recipe and all who had it raved.   Used European style butter ( higher butterfat) and I would say it was a sturdy yet chewy cookie that sat for about 3 hrs decorated before we ate it.   I'd make this again!

I have made this many times. Depending on the occasion, I will switch up the fruit. Strawberries and blueberries obviously go well for 4th of July. I have used tangerines, oranges, bananas, grapes, etc to mix it up. Always a hit!

We liked it. We used Bello's suggestion of 2tsp vanilla, 8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of thawed cool whip for the sauce.  The cookie crust was fabulous!

I use this recipe every time, I've been making it for like three years now. It is my family's summertime favorite dessert. I found my favorite fruit combination to be bananas, blueberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. We use premade dough since I'm always pressed for time with six kids running around here at times

I have made these for years and they are always a hit. I make it simple though and focus on the fruit since it truly is the star. I use store bought cookie dough and then I use canned cream cheese frosting. It doesn't get soggy or runny on me this way.

Taste amazing! I made it for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it. I added minced fruit to the cream cheese mixture, to make it more fruity. I also made the crust the night before to make sure it was cool.

After watching the instructional video for this recipe, I had great success with this crust. WATCH THE VIDEO! I made this fruit pizza as written, but doubled and used a large (11 1/2 x 17) baking sheet. Baking took longer than a single recipe, in fact I think I had the thing in the oven for about 20 minutes. (Bake, open door to check, bake, open door to check...) The crust does puff up and is hard to get out of the pan. My poor good baking sheet now has knife scratches. Next time I will use parchment paper. I would only use prepared dough if desperate for time. Crust was easy, fast, and delicious as only a real-butter cookie can be. Others add Cool Whip, pudding, etc. to the filling but I prefer a thinner filling with the pronounced sharp cream cheese flavor and then tons and tons of fresh fruit on top. Book Club members loved it, and hubs loved it too!

At the suggestion of AMBER79, I doubled the crust; but it looked like it would be way too thick in a 9x13 so I baked it in a 10x15.  I also doubled the frosting and it was the perfect ratio.  The fruits I used were blueberries, strawberries, and peaches--I forgot to buy kiwi at the store or it would have been included.  This was fantastic, and I will definitely make it again.  (Also, thank you, CAMILEA, for suggesting cutting it before adding fruit--that way one can assure that every piece will get all the fruit.)

This recipe was wonderful!  I used sugar cookie dough to save time, but it may have come out a little too sweet - may try the given dough recipe next time.  I made individual pizzas, which worked out well, because I made them as people wanted them, which probably helped eliminate the problem of soggy crust.  I used mango, kiwi, strawberry, and banana for the toppings.  The mango especially added great flavor and color.  I also had some ganache left over from another recipe and threw that on a couple to add a little chocolate flair, which was great!

This was a big hit at a weekend cookout! I used store bought cookie dough and added coolwhip to the cream cheese mixture and used powdered sugar. Everyone loved it! Thanks

Absolutely delicious! I made this for mothers day and it was a huge hit with my family. I used strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, kiwi, and banana as a topping. It all went great with the delicious cream cheese mixture

This is great!  My only complaint is that it took about an extra 5 minutes to bake but that could be my oven and not the recipe.

This was an amazing cookie. I made it for my husbands birthday and we both loved it. I didn't have a pizza pan, so I used a regular pan instead. I also used store bought cookie dough as others have suggested. This will definitely be made again!

A nice idea, but I've had an issue with it. Perhaps it's just my bad luck coming to smite my kitchen(again), but I'd much rather just make it with a traditional sugar cookie dough, frost it, and be done with it. Ungreased, as the recipe said, it stuck to my cookie sheet and I had to pry it off roughly with a spatula - and saved no piece larger than half my palm(which is not very big). This made frosting difficult, so I ended up smearing the broken, over-buttery pieces with globs from a fork. The only pretty part was drizzling it with cuts of strawberries and mandarin oranges at the last minute. I believe that I'm brave enough to try this again, but I wish it had turned out better this first time. Still, a wonderful dessert if it would but cooperate!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I made it tonight for super bowl and it was a hit. I didnt put fruit on top though. I had strawberries, pineapple, and blue berries in different bowls and let everyone pick what they wanted to add to it! I gave it a four star because the cookie part was falling apart...I think next time...Ill make it thinner and maybe that will do the job.

My family and I did not like this dish. The dough tasted off, the cream cheese "frosting" was okay and we used kiwi and strawberry. The strawberry was all right, but the kiwi tasted awful with this one. Surprised becuase a lot of reviews were good.

Wow, this stuff is AMAZING! I got my first taste of this back in the day in high school home economics class... Except then we used pre-made sugar cookie dough to make the crust.
For this recipe, I used a Teflon medium sized jelly-roll pan (the perfect fit!), and baked the crust for 10 minutes. I used sliced strawberries and kiwi to decorate. My hubby loved it! He inhaled his first piece just to make sure he got a 2nd slice before everyone else attacked the pan :)

This was an awesome dessert and not very hard to make.  You can top it with basically any fruit you have on hand. I used strawberries and blueberries.  The crust is very good, not too sweet.

I wrote down all the fruits I saw in the picture and make it just like that.  Made a double sized one for a party, and had room for blackberries and rasberries also.  Have made this several times, easy and so pretty!  A real crowd pleaser.

This is absolutely fabulous.  I loved the crust, it was better than your average sugar cookie and very easy to make the time it takes to make this is probably less than it would would take to buy one from the store it is definately worth.  TRY THIS it is sooooo good!

I only made the sugar cookie crust from this recipe as I already have my own cream cheese mixture. The crust was a little too crisp on day 1, but great for the subsequent days.  Definitely not too sweet.

This recipe has made me a boss' favorite!!  Often used as a bargaining chip which turns out nicely for me!  Recipe is great for many work potlucks, I double the recipe and use a WELL GREASED jelly roll pan.  I also sub in Neufatchel Cheese (next to Cream cheese in dairy aisle) as its the same price, but way less fat!  Going to try the Fruit Pizza with Glaze recipe on the next batch, look it up and try it out!  This is a very inexpensive treat thats got a bit of a healthier stance than the average brownie and cookie tray.

Brought it to the fireworks on 4th of July, and it didn't last very long.  I used strawberries, bananas, kiwi, peaches and raspberries.  Not only did it look pretty, it tasted excellent.  The only thing I changed was I 1/2ed the sugar for the cream cheese filling, but I am not big on sweet stuff.

For those people who thought it was too sweet, try adding strawberry glaze on top of the cream cheese filling.

Thanks for the recipe, this was a hit with
my kids, they picked the fruits and loved
it.  Great for any type of potluck or 
family get together - can have a very 
elegant presentation.

I cheated and used the ready-made sugar cookie dough.  The finished pizza was delicious and was the first dessert to disappear at our family's Easter dinner.

The recipe turned out beautifully!  I used bananas, strawberries, blackberries, kiwi, and oranges (cut into triangle slices).  The readymade sugar cookie dough is the way to go!

At first I thought maybe my pizza pan was too big for this recipe. I had trouble getting this to spread in the pan because the dough was so soft. I tried with my fingers, but the dough stuck to my hands. I ended up sprinkling flour over the dough and then spreading it. It made it easier to spread it out this way. This was very yummy as the end result.
I used peaches, kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, and bananas. Everyone loved it!!!!

Yummmmmy! And very easy too though I definantly will let the refriderated sugar cookie dough I used get to room temp next time before trying to roll it out. I use manderine oranges, kiwi, strawberry's and blueberries for beautiful looking (and yummy tasting) pizza. A crowd pleaser!

Absolutely WONDERFUL & easy.  Quite decadent & sweet....  I drizzled 1/2 of the pizza with a melted Ghiradelli milk chocolate & the other half with melted Ghiradelli dark chocolate -- to offset the sweet with a little 'tart'.... Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I used Pillsbury refrigerated cookie dough to save time and it still came out wonderful.  I used kiwi, blueberries, strawberries, and Mandarin oranges.  So pretty I almost didn't want to cut it, it makes a nice summer dessert for a picnic or backyard barbeque.

Very yummmy!  The only fault I had was with the crust.  I had to cook the cookie longer than suggested and even then it was still very soft.

I used pre-made cookie dough and this turned out to be a hit with the adults and children at our party. I used bananas, strawberries and kiwi I i glazed it to keep it from turning brown in the fridge. (Glaze - mix 1/2 cup apricot preserves with 1/4 cup of water and brush onto the top). It was SOOO good. I also added a bit more cream cheese because I like a nice thick layer on my pizza!

I remember making this recipe in my home ec class back in high school. The only difference is for an extra topping on top of the fruit we mixed some powdered sugar with water to drizzle over the top. I am so glad i found the recipe. Thank you for posting it!

I've made this quite a few times now, and it's always a hit. I usually substitute the crust with a sugar cookie mix, just because I normally don't have a lot of time. I use fresh strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and bananas.

I was looking for a way to use some of the delicious summer berries and came across this recipe. I took it to a barbeque and it was a huge hit!  I used the store bought cookie dough with strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and kiwi. Make sure not to put it together until just before serving or the cookie crust will get soggy.

I didn't get rave reviews on this, as I was expecting.  I thought that the trouble I went to to make it from scratch would be noticed, but I think the recipe that uses store-bought sugar cookie dough was better received.  I'll try that one next time.

I loved the cookie recipe that the pizza is made of.  Soft and chewy but still able to hold the toppings.  Be creative and use candy crumbles along with the fruit.  Also, to dress it up, if you have a limited supply of fruit try adding decorations in your cupboard left over from Christmas Cookies- it will look great!

This pizza is wonderful!  I took it to a potluck at church and had several asking for the recipe.  I had kids asking me if they could take the rest home.  It was great.  The cream cheese is excellent with the fruit.

I made mine with the refrigerated dough and it turned out nicely.  Even the picky hubby enjoyed.  One caution: Try to serve it when you know it will be eaten at one sitting or it will be a bit soggy (due to the fruit topping).  Thanks!

It was just OK - I did not care too much for the taste of the cookie.  I recommend that you buy the ready made dough at the store.

I made this fruit pizza for my college singles group and it was a hit.  Even the junk food lovers didn't mind that it involved fruit so it might be "healthy."  :-)

The adults liked this recipe but most of the kids did not.  It was good, but I probably won't be making it again.

Made this last night and it was a hit!  The only problem was that I over cooked the cookie!  I cooked it the amount of time it said on the cookie dough package. Next time I will not cook it so long.  Everything else was wonderful!  I used raspberries, blueberries, kiwi and manderin oranges.  Put strawberry glaze on top of the fruit.  YUM!

I wonder how big would I be if I made and ate this every day? I think it's worth trying. I used the cookie recipe included here. I baked it a few minutes later than the recipe calls for...it didn't overcook at all and the cookie didn't get soggy..even by the next day.

I USED PILLSBURY SUGAR COOKIE TUBE.  THIS WAS GREAT AND EASY.  DOES NOT KEEP.  THE COOKIE CRUST GOT SOGGY BY THE END OF THE PARTY.  IT WAS A HIT! I USED STRAWBERRIES, KIWI, BLUEBERRIES, PEACHES, AND JUST BEFORE SERVING I ADDED BANANAS.

This recipe was very good. Another variation would be to use a regular pie crust,and layers of grape jello,cream cheese mixture and the blueberries or strawberries, alternating.

I hate to repeat every other review but this was fantastic.  It makes a very large "pizza" we got more than 10 servings.  I used strawberries, kiwi and blueberries.  EXCELLENT!!

I made this for a clown club B.B.Q and everyone loved it.  Next time I may add some Ammeretto to the frosting.  I coverd the pizza pan with parchment paper then served it in a pizza box.

I used the ready made sugar cookie dough and that helped speed things up, but still preparing and arranging all the fruit takes plenty of time.  However it did taste very good and can be used as a breakfast food or dessert.

My relatives have raved about this recipe!  I would recommend baking the crust longer (10-12 min. or so) to make sure it is firm enough; the moisture from the fruit and cream cheese ensure softness.

Great recipe with lots of options to use
different seasonal fruits.  
Especially easy when using the cookie 
dough as the crust.

This is a very good dessert for any season. It is very versatile as you can add whatever fruit is in season, or whatever fruits are your favorites. You can even make it with different fruits on each half to accomodate people with different tastes. Everyone I have made this for has liked it very much, & the recipe is frequently requested by others.

Fantastically easy, light, and fresh.  An excellent idea for the summer.  Also could do individual cookies with the filling and a single, fanned strawberry on top.

This recipe is so easy using refrigerated cookie dough that you just roll out.  It is very easy for children to make with supervision.  I would not hesitate to recommend this recipe at all.

I used refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough for the crust of one and regular sugar cookie dough for the crust of another.  Everyone loved both, but I noticed that the chocolate chip one was gone first.

I made this recipe with the quick crust. It was great. Plan on using it at family cookouts and son's graduation party.
