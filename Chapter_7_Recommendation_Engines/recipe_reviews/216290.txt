Rating this recipe got mixed reviews from my hubby and me--I would give it a 4, he thinks I should serve it to company the next time!  So I opted in his favor because anything he likes is a plus to me.  He commented a number of times how much he loved this.  I made it exactly as directed, and if we went by his reaction, it would make enough for only three people!  I served it over sticky rice (calrose).  This took me 45 minutes from beginning to end to prepare--usually the first time I make something it takes me a little longer.   Note:  I'm having trouble getting good pictures with the lighting now that it has to be done inside at night!   Thanks for the recipe.

Moist and tender pork with the sweetness of the peaches and the crunch of the pecans made this dish awesome and easy to cook.  I sliced the pork after searing the meat on all sides

This was alright, but not anything I would be excited to make again.  I like that it uses things I normally would have in the pantry, but that is what it tasted like... canned items thrown together.  I felt like it needed more fresh ingredients to improve the taste.  Maybe using fresh peaches in place of canned would help.
