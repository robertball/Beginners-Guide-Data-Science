Wow!!! Why didn't I find this recipe before the other cornbread one?!?! It was absolutely amazing! I had to make muffins out of it since I didn't have the right size loaf pan, and they were some of the best muffins ever!!! I cooked them for 13 minutes and they came out so moist!!! Thank you!!!!

Excellent recipe and perfect size for 2 people. Although I tried tripling the recipe and it didnt cook right in a loaf pan as the outside was well cooked and inside was raw. Next time i will try in a shallow pan. Yummy. Oh and I reduced the sugar and have cooked it with either canola oil or shortening. Its good both ways.

Very good. Just the right size for my family. I substituted canola oil for the melted shortening.

Great recipe--I used whole wheat flour instead of white (my preference) and it was wonderful--served warm with maple butter :)

Thanks so much for this recipe. Something great to try is substitute all or part of the milk with buttermilk and use corn flour and brown sugar.

This recipe is a perfect size and the perfect sweetness if eating this with something else.  To eat with butter alone, I might add another tablespoon of sugar.  We microwaved the shortening to melt it then poured the milk in afterwards and it chunked up again so then I had to microwave that mixture about 30 seconds and stir until the shortening melted, and then stir in the beaten egg while stirring briskly.  I think there is a misprint - the recipe calls for a 8x4x2 baking dish but really this only fills a 4x4x2 baking dish (Ikea has a nice clear glass one for like $2.99).  I needed the full 18 minutes.

My husband's exact words were "you could open a cornbread store with this cornbread!"  I, like others, modified by doubling the sugar.

Turned out very nicely, but not sweet enough to be eaten alone, good to dip with, or slather with butter, or jam.
I like sweeter corn bread better.
I will make again, but I will double or triple the amount of sugar.
Thanks!

I really like this recipe because it makes a small amount of corn bread- perfect for our small family. It tasted good too! It wasn't very sweet even after I doubled the sugar, so next time I'll triple it- I just like my cornbread sweet though. I will make this cornbread again!

If you want a good simple corn bread, this is the one! Super-easy and quick to make, and very easy to eat...my husband commented that it didn't have the gritty texture of other cornbreads he's had, and we both had seconds. I used Smart Balance for the shortening but it was still good.  Just make sure you keep an eye on the clock--this one needed exactly the amount of time in the oven that the recipe recommended, anymore than that I think it might have burnt.

I made this tonight and it turned out well; will definitely make it again.  I'll never buy cornbread mix or already made cornbread ever again.  I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar (added more like other reviewers suggested), and rice milk.  I didn't use any salt.  I was cooking for one and it was just the right amount.

Very Good, although if you were to divide this up into 8 servings they would be some very small servings! Also, this pretty good straight out of the oven, but doesn't keep well.

Aboslutely wonderful recipe. Perfect every time. Add a bit more sugar for more of a dessert cornbread, or follow the recipe for a very nice accompaniment to chilli. Excellent and easy!

This was a great recipe for two - moist and not too sweet, and quick and easy to throw together.  I used butter instead of shortening.

I wasn't too impressed...the corn bread seemed a bit dry.  I used corn flour, doubled the sugar and substituted vegetable oil for the shortening...maybe I should have stuck with the original recipe.  Oh well...I'll try a different recipe for corn bread next time.

Not spectacular, but not bad either. For minimal effort, it tasted like Jiffy box cornbread, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it just wasn't earth shatteringly-good. On the other hand, the serving size was just perfect for a loaf to accompany our (3-person) chili dinner.

This is a really good and (more importantly) really easy cornbread recipe.  I have always used jiffy cornbread mix because its so good and so easy, but this is only about 2 more steps than using the mix and tastes almost identical.  I might try just a bit more sugar next time, but it was great as is.  Perfect for 2 people.  Would be great with buttermilk.

Very good corn bread recipe. I did used 3 Tbsp sugar per reviewers, and also substituted evaporated milk because I didn't have any regular milk. It was great, and just enough for the two of us!

I tried three different cornbread recipes - the non-sweet kind - and this one was the best.  Just a hint of sweetness and great texture.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used an 8" square glass baking dish and I used vegan shortening (no trans fat).

Perfect cornbread. Period! This recipe makes exactly 24 mini muffins which is perfect for our family with a 2 yr old. He loves these "baby cornbread muffins" that are crispy outside and moist inside. He'll put away 6 mini muffins at a time with his soup or chili. Then he and the hubs will fight over the last muffin.. That makes this recipe a 10 star recipe in my book! ;)

I thought this recipe was great. I just made it for my roommate and I and we both loved it. I would like to try a little bit sweeter version next time, so I may add sugar (I actually added about a half a tablespoon more), but following the recipe pretty much exactly, I loved it. I had to cook mine for about 20 minutes, because of my pan.

Great and very easy recipe. We only had polenta on hand so we used that and used 1 1/2 tbs coconut oil instead of shortening. Turned out really good with just the lightest whiff of coconut :D

Delicious!  I had no shortening, so used margarine.  Quick and easy to mix, and ready  to eat with dinner.  It was so good that I had to have more with butter and honey for dessert.  If a second person wanted some, they would have had to beg!  Terrific recipe for a person living alone. Thanks!

Even though I used butter to make this recipe, it still was a little dry. Once you put more butter on it though - perfect! Tastes extra yummy if you use corn flour instead of all-purpose flour (and cuts out the gluten!)

This was really good, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for...It was served well with chili and the men loved it.  I will keep looking for my perfect bread..:(

A+++++ recipe!  Easy and tasty!  Instead of sugar, I used unpacked brown sugar.  My husband and my son both loved this recipe.  At least for our family, we didn't have to double the sugar to give all of us the BIG :-)  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very good. I can't rate the recipe as written, though. I didn't have cornmeal or shortening, so I subbed corn grits (ground a bit in the blender) and canola oil as the previous reviewer suggested. Turned out moist, slightly sweet with a nice grainy texture. It didn't rise much, but we didn't mind and it's probably due to my modifications. Will make again soon!

Except for making it into muffins instead of a loaf, I made this recipe exactly as it explained, and it just didn't turn out right... There were pockets in the muffins that didn't bake at all. And there was a weird aftertaste... Maybe I did something wrong??? But I followed the directions exactly... Won't make these again.

this was pretty good. I had doubled the recipe and found the cook time needed to be longer as the middle was still runny.

This is a fantastic recipe but it was a bit dry. Perhaps due to the modifications I made? I used soy milk for the milk (of course!)and canola oil for the shortening. I also used sugar beat syrup instead of sugar (I love this stuff). Finally, the mixture felt too runny so I added another handful of cornmeal. Next time I will try it without the extra handful. I would say that it was boarder line too sweet however. This will become a regular in our household.

I loved this corn bread.  I substituted white corn flour for the wheat flour as I have celiac disease and can't eat any gluten.  It turned out perfectly and I am NOT a baker. Thank you!!!!

Yup! I agree. Quick, easy and delicious! Love that it only made a small amount. I used a mini loaf tray which has 8 mini loaves in it. The recipe filled 6 of them. I thought I would free a couple. Hubby usually doesn't like corn bread, but he like this one. Thanks!

Very good basic cornbread for 2.  I substitued Safflower Oil for the Shortning, and I used Honey instead of sugar as I had some to use up.  I also had a mixture of Polenta (coarser grain) and Corn Meal and will need to make sure it's Corn Meal only so that the grains are fully cooked next time.

They were good, but I have to say that I've had better, still looking for that perfect corn bread recipe.

Excellent cornbread.  It was a little too sweet for my boyfriend, but I liked the amount of sugar.  Went great with my pinto beans.
