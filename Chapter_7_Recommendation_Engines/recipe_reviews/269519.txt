I used three cloves of garlic instead of two and skipped the butter. I skipped the lemon and put a tiny bit of lemon pepper instead.  I skipped the stove-top cooking. Instead, I put them straight in the oven at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes. I added a little garlic powder and granulated onion. They came out perfect!

Great recipe, thank you for posting!  (only thing I tweaked was the oven time, went 5 mins longer).

I love Parmesan cheese and garlic. I added 1 Tbsp more cheese and minced 1 more clove of garlic, the flavors came through even more

Made exactly as written.  No additions or changes.  Was excellent!  Potatoes were flavorful, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  The lemon zest was a wonderful addition.  Will definitely make this one again.

This was so simple, and my family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. They're just the right crispiness on the outside and tender on the inside.

I've made these 3 times . Easy to make, and taste great made in the oven. I've also cooked these in the microwave and they also tasted very good when done that way. This is an easy recipe to personalize.
