Although the recipe seems pretty bland, this was actually really good!  My husband is very picky, and he liked it and would eat it again. I halved the recipe and made it for me and my husband.
I used hot sausage, added whole mushrooms, sliced garlic and green onion, used extra Italian seasoning, topped with fresh ground pepper, and put some Cholula on the chicken.

I think I might try it with chicken breasts next time, though, since bone in chicken is annoying to eat.

Will definitely be making this again!

I couldn't wait to tell you how much this was enjoyed!!! So, so good! I did take the advice of another reviewer and added hot sauce to the chicken (we like spicy food) and some chopped garlic, but oh my goodness....I was in food heaven. I also added extra broth and we sopped it up with crusty bread! My husband got home later ant polished off the rest!! Too good on a cold, damp winter night....Thank you!

I had a variety of left overs, one was three hot Italian sausages, the other cooked shredded chicken breasts. It occurred to me the sweet red peppers would be mush if in the oven for an hour. So I put the sausage potatoes and onions in – I also misread ‘Italian seasoning ‘and thought ‘Italian dressing’, so painted the potatoes with a small amount of dressing after pouring chicken broth. It was tasty! I have on hand bouillon cubes – so that is what I generally use. After things cooked a half hour I put the peppers in – all smelled pretty good. In last 5-10 minutes I moved everything over in the casserole pan (there was a lot of liquid) then put in shredded chicken breasts. The liquid made chicken taste AMAZING as it sopped up a lot of liquid. Italian hot sausage I think made all the difference. I could have waited 40-45 minutes before adding the peppers, next time I’ll wait also to add onions. Some of the potatoes were totally cooked – some potatoes were a little crunchy. Adding 15-20 more baking minutes will add to the potatoes getting totally cooked. I might think about adding carrots too, to put in maybe the first 20 minutes cooking. My husband ate more of this than 90% of what I fix him. It also looked pretty good – accept for shredded chicken – next time I’ll take pictures – it was surprisingly good.

I use less liquid and more spice, and it's a nice dinner dish.  If you don't have potatoes, put it over rice. You can also add chopped tomatoes instead of broth, then finish with marinated artichokes! awesome!

I was really disappointed. Very odd taste and chicken was questionable.

This was awesome!!  I made a couple of changes based on the reviews of others.  I halved this recipe.  First, instead of the chicken broth - I used a FULL cup (for half the recipe) of Italian dressing.  I used chicken breasts cut into 1-2 inch pieces.  Since I didn't have red potatoes on hand, I used couple yukon gold and couple of russet cut into 1 inch chunks.  As suggested, I put the peppers in after 30 minutes and gave everything a stir.  After another 30 minutes - everything was done - potatoes as well.   This was delicious.  I did salt and pepper and added a few minced cloves of garlic (that I mixed in with the dressing) as well.  Next time - I'm going to throw in some whole cloves of garlic in to roast along with everything else.  Definitely a keeper and super easy!  Thank you!

Very good, but I didn't have any Italian sausage, so I used smoked sausage and added Cajun seasonings instead of Italian.  Yum!

Once in awhile I like to find a new recipe that's not hard and has ingredients we like and surprise my wife with dinner that I fixed. found this recipe and after reading reviews I made it, and it was good. Only difference is I added Italian Dressing to marinade (stole that from comments) and used small amount of really hot hot peppers to help spice it up instead of the red peppers. (stole that idea also). Came out with just the right amount of tang. I saved this to my favorites, will use that another time.

Really tasty recipe. My only complaint was that the veggies and chicken need some seasoning. a little salt and pepper, and garlic powder go a long way here :)

I really liked this recipe.  Used hot Italian sausage, upped the seasoning just a bit and added seasoned pepper.  I also added about 50% more broth.  I only use Better Than Bullion for my broth and stock needs though.  More flavor, less salty.  Russet potatoes worked just fine.  And, I followed some previous reviewer's advice by adding the peppers (green and red) halfway through the cooking (oh, and at least double the peppers!).  This was a wonderful, easy, one dish meal!

We loved it! We added two cloves of crushed garlic and used smoked sausage. It came out great. Really wish we had thought of grabbing some crusty bread before dinner.
