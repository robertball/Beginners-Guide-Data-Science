Easy and quick to make.  Everybody liked it.  I fixed the rice separately and added the remainder at the end.

This was a hit especially with my super fussy teen who said it was the best rice dinner I have ever made!   I served it with extra picante sauce on the side so they could add more if they wanted to.   I will be making this again for sure.

It was "ok" but not what I think of when I think of Jambalaya.

Absolutely phenomenal! I left out the peas, added an orange bell pepper and some celery and a bit of ground pork that I needed to use up. Also, I used diced garlic instead of garlic powder. Wonderful!
