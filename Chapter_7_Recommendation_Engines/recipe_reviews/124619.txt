This coffee cake has been on our table for Easter Sunday brunch every year since 1994, so it has become a family tradition. It is delicious and a very pretty cake, however, I use only 1 tsp. almond extract, and sliced almonds rather than slivered.

Love it. I found this recipe originally in the Chicago Tribune- October 3, 1991.  Yep, I cut it out and kept the recipe.  It has become part of our family's Christmas morning brunch tradition.  It is a big hit every time I take it to a function with many requests for the recipe.  There is nothing "light" about this cake, but it is worth every calorie loaded bite.  For those who must count- 1/12 of a cake is 441 calores, 63 mg cholesterol, 26 g fat. **Update**  I just read all of the reviews.  There are some differences between the AR recipe and the original Chi Trib one.  I think the differences created some of less than 5star reviews.  Original recipe calls for:  Almond extract 1 teaspoon (may address the too almondy issues.) 10" springform pan (should solve the too cakey issue.)  Bake 45-55 minutes (Should address the over cooked or dry comments.)  Hope this helps.

I doubled the recipe and made in a 13x9 pan. I followed the advice to hold back more than 1 cup of topping - since I doubled the recipe, I held back 3 cups. There was still an insane amount of batter left over and I mean for both the top (struesel) and bottom (cake) layers! I only used about 1 cup of the struesel to top and next time will be either finding a way to cut down on the batter part or just making 2 pans of cake. I plan on using the leftover struesel topping on some muffins.(Honestly, I think the recipe as written would probably work better in a 9x13 pan just so that it wouldn't be so cakey.) The cheese/jam layer was tasty but I would suggest adding some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. And please, please, PLEASE let this sit overnight before eating it. It wasn't enough just to let it cool completely - it tasted horrible to me when freshly baked! Hubby ate it fresh and said the almond extract was way too strong (I used 2 tsp). I found that when I tasted it this morning, the almond flavor in the cake part has mellowed considerably.

This coffe cake has been a signature recipe for me for many years, even before it was featured on All Recipies. If you follow directions properly and do not substitute, it will turn out perfectly.  I have a problem with so called "expert" level cooks who change recipies or don't have the proper ingredients and then rate the recipe lower than necessary through no fault of their own.  Please use the proper pan, use almond extract, not vanilla and please DO NOT add lemon. Also, do not take out more of the dry batter than called for at the beginning because the ratio will not coincide with the liquid added to make the batter for the crust. This is truly one of the best deserts ever. Try it!

Delicious & beautiful cake! I also cut the almond extract to 1t. - perfect amount of almond-ness. I also used sliced almonds & mixed them with the crumb mixture. I heated up my "Simply Fruit" Raspberry Spread (less sweet than jam)for about 15 seconds, which made it easier to spread on as the layer on top of the cream cheese mixture. Lost the bottom to my springform pan(???) - but baked up fine in a round 10" cake pan. EXTRA NOTE: This coffee cake tastes much better when completely cooled, in my opinion, so factor in cooling time if you are making it for breakfast!

What a lovely coffee cake.  It is easy to make and looks impressive.I followed the recipe except that I used sliced almonds since that is all I had and I added a little powdered sugar drizzle.  Better than the bakery.  The baking time is right on.  Rave reviews from my co-workers.  Thanks for a recipe that is a keeper.

I had just finished baking this cake when I received a call that a cousin's husband had just passed away.  I quickly wrapped up the cake and said a little prayer that it would be good and brought it to her.  Although I never tasted it she said all the tasters of this cake raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I am definitly going to make it again for one of my Easter desserts.  It has a very nice appearance and I am sure it would be good with any flavor preserves.

Followed the recipe and this is good but I will make a couple of changes next time. There was a little too much filling for us and the filling was too sweet. The cake was a tad dry. A couple of people mentioned that it reminded them more of a cheesecake type of dessert than a coffee cake.  The raspberry/almond flavor is excellent and I will try again with some small tweaks. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled and baked it in a 9x13 glass dish for a teachers' breakfast. Wow, is it tasty! I still baked for an hour, and the center had a small soft spot. I let it cool overnight at room temperature, uncovered, and served from the dish. I used apricot/mango/peach jam. Only change I'll make is to reduce the almond extract.

This was fabulous even with the small changes I made.  I eliminated the almond all together and used vanilla extract and put lemon zest into the crust.  Yes the crust IS thick, I only removed 1 cup per recipe not following reviews  but it is definitely THICK. Thanks for sharing this is a keeper.

I absolutely recommend using SEEDLESS jam.  Raspberry seeds are too gritty and prominent for this recipe's delicate balance of flavors and textures.

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted vanilla for the almond extract but otherwise followed this wonderful recipe.  My husband commented that the raspberry cream cheese filling was possibly the most delicious thing he has ever tasted.  Will definately make this recipe again.  And again.  And again.

This actually deserves 4.5 stars.  It was really good!!  It's one fault was that it was a little too dry.  When I was making it however, I had no sour cream, so I used 5/8 cup butter milk which I made by dropping a few drops of lime juice in the milk.  I also forgot to save out the cup of topping.

Oh, so good!  Just the right amount of almond flavor and the cream cheese filling is wonderful!  Might add a bit more jam next time, but wonderful as written.  The cake is a bit dry as other reviewers have said, but I think that this just balances the cheesy filling. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I enjoyed this coffee cake; my husband said it reminded him of a Danish pastry.  His only complaint was that the crust was too thick.  I didn't have enough almond extract so I used vanilla to make up the difference.  I also left out the slivered almonds.

I decreased the almond to 1 tsp. and cooked it in a 10 inch spring form pan. I starting checking it after 40 minutes and ended up baking it a total of 55 minutes (until the cheese layer was just barely wiggly-like a cheesecake). I let it cool for about 30 minutes before digging in and as delicious as it was warm, I am sure it will be even better after the cheesecake layer has had a chance to set up (I put it in the fridge). I used homemade raspberry jam and the sweetness of the jam and streusel complemented the buttery cake and cheese layers perfectly! Absolutely delicious and beautiful!!!

another easy, excellent recipe. danish-like, which is what i was going for. used 9x13 glass baking dish, leftover jams (various flavors abt 1/2 C, 8 oz cream cheese w/other ingredients.  for future i would add more than 1/2 cup jam, possibly fresh fruit as well and i would sprinkle top w/sugar so it caramelizes.

The taste was good but the cake itself was pretty dry in the areas that's weren't doused in cream cheese or jam.  I would make this again IF I can figure out how to make it less dry.

Baked the recipe exactly as instructed.  The only change I made was to use a 10" Springform pan instead of the 9".  Although I have not even cut into the cake I know this is going to be very good.  I did double the raspberry jam though, with the increase in pan size.

I loved everything except for the cake part of the coffee cake. I think the batter is a little too heavy and dense for my liking. Next time I will try a bigger pan to see if that will work. The raspberry, cream cheese and crumb topping was delicious. I also used vanilla extract, I'm not a big almond extract fan, but still wanted to try out the recipe. I keep everything else the same.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I would recommend baking it about five minutes shy of the recommended time... Mine ended up just a tad dry but I believe if I had taken it out a bit early it would have been perfecto.

FANTASTIC! This is just what I was looking for. The combination of ingredients is a perfect blend, sweet and decadent!  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 and thought the base was a bit too "cakey," even though it still was scrumptious.  Next time I will add more cream cheese and raspberry if making a 9x13.  The pan did almost overflow and took a bit longer to cook so maybe next time I may also just make some mini coffee cakes by putting "extra" mix into muffin pans.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe.  It's a keeper!

according to one of my daughters, this is the best coffee cake she's ever had. I think I agree with her. It really was sensational. For the most part followed the directions and ingredients but did have to make a couple of substitutions. I was out of sour cream and subbed in plain Greek yogurt and instead of the raspberry jam (didn't have any), I thought I would use up what I had left of a jar of lemon-pear marmalade. I did have some frozen raspberries that I sprinkled on top of the jam layer and then topped with the crumbs. Baked in a 10" springform pan for 1 hour. The center was jiggly but set up nicely. The crumb of the cake itself was perfect. Not dry at all. I'm not sure what went wrong with some of the other reviewers, but rest assured that this will be made again. The combo of the lemon, almonds and raspberries works beautifully together.

This coffee cake is delicious! I had to fight off my husband for the last piece, who according to him "hates anything that has cream cheese."  I took another reviewers suggestion and used a 10" springform pan, used a little more raspberry jam and reduced the almond extract to 1 tsp. It was a little dry but I think it was just my oven so next time I will reduce oven time by 5 or 10 min. It is great with coffee-YUMMM. Highly recommend...

This recipe was amazing!  I added about a 1/4 cup more of the Raspberry Jam since I like my food really fruity.  I followed another reviewers advice and heated the jam up for a few seconds in the microwave, and it spread perfectly over the cream cheese filling.  I didn't have the correct pan, so I used a deep dish pie dish and it truned out perfect!  I cooked it the night before and let it cool completely.  I did drizzle a powered sugar drizzle over the top before serving it!  I can't wait to make this again!!!

I made this for my coworked after an especially tense week.  Boy did it hit the spot.  Everyone loved it!  I only have a 9 inch springform pan, so it was a little thinner, and a little darker, but that made it nice and nutty.  A little dry for my liking - but that was most likely baker error.  Still, very good.  I would definitely make it again.

Good, but not as good as I expected.  I used boysenberry jam because that's what I had on hand.  We ate most of it, but even my kids weren't that into it by the time it was half gone.  It DEFINITELY needs to be made in a wider pan so it doesn't come out so deep.

This was so-so. I don't think I'd make it again without some significant modifications. I followed the recipe and found that the crust was dry, crumbly and lacking in flavor. Perhaps some cinnamon would help here, but to not sure how to correct the dryness, except for reducing the baking time. We liked the filling but there needs to be more than 1/2 cup jam. The topping needs to have cinnamon added too. I think I'll look for another recipe.

I think this is the best coffee cake I've ever had! I ended up using a 9" round cake pan. After it was done baking, and cooling for 15 minutes, I inverted it onto a plate, then inverted it onto another plate, so it was right side up. This worked great, and looked FABULOUS! It ALMOST looked as good as it tasted! I used homemade blackberry jam. MMMMMM!!

Major disappointment.  I read the reviews, checked the Taste of Home original recipe and thought I would give it a try anyway.  Wish I would have saved my ingredients.  The cake was dry and crumbly.  Fell apart when cut into.  The crust was BLAND and not sweet enough to have any flavor.  It looked pretty, smelled good but that is about it. Wont be making this again.

This looked and smelled so good we were eating it right out of the oven.  Delish!  It was actually better warm than cold.    Made exactly like the recipe except I added some fresh raspberries.  yummy!

WOW!  This was awesome!  I bake a lot and this was really something different.  I omitted the almond extract and used vanilla.  The only othere change I made was using fresh blueberry "sauce" by throwing 1/2 cup water, 1 tsp cornstarch and 1/2 cup sugar into a saucepan with about 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  Brought to a boil, and used in place of the raspberry jam.  I did not have an issue with too much crumb topping.  I kind of swirled the cream cheese, blueberries and crumb topping and made sure all of the crumb topping was pushed into the wet ingredients a little.

This was very good. I made it for a group meeting at work. One person pleaded with me to make it again, "I will pay you to make it for me." I did not use the almonds or almond extract but used vanilla instead. The filling was very good.  Also, I added brown sugar in the crumbled portion.  Next time I will add the brown sugar to the entire dry mixture.  Also, I only baked it for about 40-45 minutes, my oven can be tricky sometimes but keep an eye on it. When I added the raspberry jam, I  used a knife to "cut" it into the cream cheese filling.  I will definetly keep this one. maybe next time I will make it with a different berry, just to switch it up a bit. :)

This was very easy to make.  Used a pastry blender to mix in the butter.  I took out 1 c. of crumb mixture and then forgot to sprinkle over the top until the cake had been in the oven for 18 minutes.  I sprinkled it on then and let it cook for an additional 5 minutes and it seemed fine.  One could use any kind of jam.  In the future, I might try mixing the jam in with the cream cheese and see how that works.  I used 1-1/2 tsp of Penzey's double strength almond extract and didn't think the almond flavor was overpowering.

This coffee cake is great with a warm glaze drizzled over the top. I made the glaze over low heat using approximately 1/4 cup butter,  cup powdered confectioner's sugar, 1 Tblsp. milk, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Drizzle it over each slice of cake for a nie-looking effect. I made this for my family and they loved it! Much to the mild annoyance of my mom, my dad said it was the best cofee cake he'd ever had.

This is superb. I made it for my boyfriend to take into his office, so it had to have "wow" factor. It did. Not only was it beautiful to look at, but he said it was gone in five minutes (inter-office phone calls about the "great treat in the break room" were all abuzz :) The only change I made was to make a  puree with some extra raspberries and sugar to drizzle on top and down the sides a little. It made it look even more yummy. I will make this again and again, and will experiment with different flavor preserves (apricot would be awesome), and maybe experiment with brandy as a flavor option! Stay tuned!

I thought it was really good but wished it had a stronger raspberry flavor.  Next time I think I will try raspberry pie filling instead.  Also, I took other people's recommendations to reduce the almond and I wish I didn't.  I couldn't really taste it.  I think the original recipe would have been better.

This is definitel a keeper!!!  Very good cake.  I couldn't wait for the cake to cool and ate a piece while it was still warm.  The cake was the perfect density.  And I think the cream cheese part will be a lot better when it' cool completely.  I sprinkled some frozen bleberries instead of using raspberry jam and it turned out to be sooo yummy!!

delicious! i made this last night to take to work for a birthday party. i made a slight change by using sugar-free strawberry preserves, sliced almonds, 1 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. i also used less of the crumble on top.   everyone thought it was so pretty and many commented that they thought it came from a bakery. i found that it was done right on time, but rose much higher than i thought it would. so make sure you don't push the batter up too high on the sides!

I made this with Pamela's Baking Mix (gluten free flour baking mix) for my husband who cannot tolerate wheat.  What a nice treat for him!!  Turned out very nice.  The baking mix is a little nutty, so can reduce almonds next time.  Next time I make this I'll add a couple tsps raspberry on the crust (before the cheesecake) and then more after adding 1/2 of the cheesecake.  Would like to have the raspberry a little bit more dispersed throughout.  I also reduced the almond ext as suggested to 3/4 tsp.  I think I may try apples, vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts next time in place of the raspberry, almond ext, almonds.  Thank you Susan for the beautiful and special cake recipe! Note:  I make an italian cheesecake which calls for cornstarch added to the cream cheese/egg/sugar.  I may try this for a more held together, dry cheesecake center.

This was delicious. As many other reviews wrote the outside of the cake almost gets over cooked and the inside where the cake and cheesecake meet get a bit undercooked. This is true but everything is still edible. I left out the almonds and doubled the raspberry jam.

Wonderful-definitely better than the bakery. It looks really great. Next time I might make just a little more of the cream cheese mixture since I'm a big cream cheese gal. Make sure your pan is big enough. Mine was a little too small and it made a mess in my oven.

This recipe was delicious... If you let it set overnight, then it is just perfect, as the cream cheese has chance to set. Thanks!

BEST COFFEE CAKE I'VE EVER HAD.  A billion times better than anything I've ever had at Starbucks or other coffee shops. I made this using strawberry jam (I didn't have raspberry), halved the recipe, baked in a loaf pan, and it was incredible.  The almond flavor is very strong when warm/fresh from the oven (I have no idea why), but it is absolutely perfect when room temperature.  This is so good with a cup of coffee in the morning, and I will be making this often.

Yum, Yum, Yum.  This coffee cake is wonderful!  I made as written using my new springform pan for the first time.  But.....my oven was a mess when it finished baking.  I didn't know the bottom of a springform pan had a top and a bottom.  I just washed the pan and popped the bottom in.  I found out from "the buzz" there is a correct way to put the bottom in.  Mine was in upside down and butter leaked out all over the oven.  Luckily it didn't affect the outcome of the coffeecake.  It was moist, looked great and cut very nicely.  My family and parents loved this recipe and I will be making it again.  Only next time, I will have the pan put together correctly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

We all thought this was delicious. I made a few changes, though. I used vanilla extract instead of almond as we're not fans of almond flavoring. I also only put one cup of the crumb base on the bottom, as per other reviewers' thoughts suggestions. I had a difficult time putting the batter up the sides of the springform pan so I decided to just skip that and hope for the best. It turned out perfect, no worries! I baked this the day before I planned to serve it and the next day it was delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  I was looking for a recipe for raspberry danish after my kids and husband devoured a box of store-bought danish recently.  Made this today and the kids ate 1/4 of  it for dessert already tonight.  Biggest compliment from my 9 year old who said "this recipe rivals something GRAMMY would make!!"  Moist, not too sweet.  I'm sure it will be even better in the morning with a latte.

I have to say I'm not a huge "sweets" person, especially not cake. That being said, I'm IN LOVE wish this dish...best coffee cake recipe ever! The cake itself has a great melt-in-your-mouth texture and a flavor similar to pound cake. I omitted the jam in favor of using up a container of fresh blueberries. The cream cheese filling combined with the fruit MAKES this recipe. This is my new go-to dish to send in to my fiance's office or make for overnight guests.

Because I was taking this to our local Oktoberfest for our friends and family to enjoy, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a large Pyrex pan. Had I not doubled it, I definitely would have taken others advice and cut back on the almond extract. I used the one and a half teaspoons and it was just enough; any more would have been overpowering. Once completely cooled, I dusted the top with powdered sugar. I'm happy to say that the cake was loved by all Susan and thank you!!

i would recommend setting aside at 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the crumbs instead of just 1; the base is too "cakey" when only one cup is removed.

ive tried this recipe with a homemade blueberry spread, and with apple pie filling and it worked very well both times.

This was pretty good.  I was wondering why everyone that reviewed this only seem to make it for special occasions, I figured it out, it takes a little work and time to put it together! I was kind of surprised by the crunchy bottom 'crust'.  It softened the next day, that may be why many found it to be better after sitting overnight.  I used a 10 in. springform pan, and only baked for 50 minutes and the bottom part was very brown, with the crumb topping still having some wet spots.  I cut down the almond extract to 1 tsp, it seemed perfect.  I might make this again.  It is definitely a recipe worthy of serving to guests, I would just let it set for a day.

Fabulous!! I substituted 2 tsp. of vanilla extract for the almond, used sugar free blackberry jam instead of raspberry, and substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar in the filling, and it came out great. I baked it according to the recipe (time & temp) but I used a springform pan for angel food cakes. It came out PERFECTLY: the crust was not too thick at all and the final coffee cake was absolutely beautiful (despite having a bit of a snub nose).

I thought this would be great from all the reviews but it was too cakey for us. Giving this a 3 because the crumbled toppings were the only good part.

I made this coffee cake and my husband took one bite and turned his nose up.  BUT - since he didn't like it, I gave the rest to friends and THEY liked it.  So did I!  I would make it again if my husband wasn't so picky (I think it was the nuts that he didn't like).

This cake is phenomenal. I used homemade raspberry freezer jam and it was perfect! Good warm out of the oven and good cold the next day out of the fridge as well.

The recipe is awesome!!  I have been thinking about making a coffee cake for about a month now, but have never made one before.  I found a few recipes that sounded good, but decided to make this one first, as my wife really loves raspberries.  It came out perfect!!  I cannot believe how good it looks and how wonderful it tastes!!  It made me look like I really knew what I was doing!!  It is good enough that you could sell slices and please everyone!!  The only 2 hard things are: Waiting the 15 minutes for it to cool before diving into it, and trying not to eat it all while it is warm!!  I could not stop eating it....it is that good!!  I did reduce the sugar a bit, and made a frosting drizzle for it.  This is a great recipe!!  I wish I would have found it a couple of months ago, while my parents were visiting.  A must try recipe for everyone who loves coffee cakes!!  I like the versitility this recipe has, as you can swap out the raspberry jam for any other flavor you like.  Thanks!!!  I will make this often!!

I baked this in a 9" springform as indicated, and followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I did not add almond slivers to the top.  Instead, I chopped up some almonds I had on-hand and toasted them along with about 1/4 cup coconut.  (I didn't add these until after the cake was finished baking.)  It turned out fabulously - lots of raspberry flavor accented by almond, beautiful moist texture with crispy topping. I baked for 56 minutes, until it started to turn light golden.  A real winner for raspberry fans.  You could also change up with some other fruit.

This is a different and very good coffee cake.  It is a lot more work than most (cutting in the butter), but worth it.  I have made it with blackberry jam instead of raspberry, and it came out even better.

Delicious! I only made a few changes-- kept the proportions the same but baked in a 9x13 dish*, added a little lemon juice and vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture, and topped the cake with a glaze after it cooled. Everyone loved it and it looked so pretty.*note: I had to reduce the oven temperature.

Oh yum!  The only thing I changed was substituting vanilla extract for the almond since I didnt have any.  I used a 9x9 pan since I wanted to cut it into easy to eat bites for work.  This was really good, but mine didnt look colorful, since the crumble was the only thing you could see.  Maybe next time I will drizzle some chocolate or jam on top.

This does turn out very pretty but for me it wasn't the best coffee cake recipe.  It's a bit of work with all the layers and something just didn't seem right to me with the cream cheese layer.  It was definitely fully baked but the cream cheese layer seemed to give the effect that it was somewhat undercooked in the center.  I did notice my son leaving behind the edge of his as another reviewer mentioned.  All of that said, there is only a small bit of it left so it is being eaten.  I may try again with some tweaks.

It was a really good cake. It looked great and was yummy.It was very moist although I'm not sure if thats how it should be or I did some thing wrong, because the texture was like baklava!! and it was not any thing like pound cake or spongy cake!I added alittle bit more soure cream and I let it coocked for 20 min more because I thought it's not cooked! but when It got cold it was very yummy.

Giving this 5 stars because my husband declared this the "most delicious coffee cake he's EVER TASTED!"  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using strawberries instead of raspberry jam.  I crushed some strawberries and cooked them with sugar, water and cornstarch until thickened.  It was around 3/4 cup, and next time I think I will increase it to 1 cup.  We ate this straight out of the oven, we couldn't even wait for it to cool!  I think next time I might use peach or pear jam.   The finished product makes a lovely presentation.   Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

This is a pretty cake. Make sure and don't overbake it. It was a lot of work and a lot of clean up but would be worth it for a special occasion. My only problem was with the cream cheese filling. I thought it could be sweeter and needed a little vanilla.

I have made this many times and always get rave reviews and people begging for the recipe!  Just be careful not to over bake as it will get dry.

Has a great flavor but the cake part is very dry - okay if you are eating it with a good cup of coffee.  I made as directed and didn't feel like I overbaked (I had to wait till the cream cheese center was set)- it is just a little drier than I like in a coffee cake.  I used apricot preserves which we thought was very good.

Most excellent!  I didn't have raspberry jam on hand, so I alternated apricot and strawberry in dollops.  I was also missing sour cream, so substituted 1 cup of plain yogurt and 3 tbsp. melted butter (which is a standard substitution for sour cream). Terrific!!

When I started I realized I only had 2 tbsps of sour cream, so I substituted vanilla yogurt for the remainder, because the yogurt was sweeten I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I omitted the almond extract and almonds due to nut allergy and used vanilla instead. The batter was really crumbly so I added some milk for it to come together. I baked the cake exactly 60 minutes, it was slightly jiggly but a previous reviewer had commented about not over baking it, I wish I had baked it a little longer, it is not really possible to test doneness with a toothpick because of the jam and everything, it was still good but a little gooey in the middle. No one complains and it looked beautiful and tasted great.

This is a fabulous cake.  I only changed two small things after reading some reviews.  I doubled the raspberry jam and I cut the almond extract down to 1 tsp.  My family gobbled this up.  Cake was moist cheese cake and raspberry great combo.  Will definitely make again.  Think I even have a couple of orders from friends!

This recipe was so-so. I made it for my Bible study and didn't taste it prior to the class.The others said they liked it but I didn't think it was that great. I used extra raspberry jam and held out 1 and one half of the topping. I also omitted the almond extract and used vanilla and a splash of lemon extract. I probably won't make this again.

Yummy!  I just made this for my daughter's Communion brunch.  After reading other reviews, I adjusted the receipe to 1 tsp. of Almond extract, reserved 1 1/2 cups of crumbs, and added 3/4 cup of seedless raspberry jam.  I only had original Philadelphia Cream Cheese in the house, so I did not go low fat. I also baked in a 10" springform pan.  The cake baked for the full 60 minutes.  It was perfect! I baked it the night before. Everyone raved about it!

I agree with the other reviews that the cake part was too cakey.  I also looked at the other pictures, and my crust turned out brown on the bottom like the others.  It didn't taste good like a muffin bottom, so I'm thinking a change is needed in the crust but I'm not sure what.    I also made a powdered sugar glaze for the top to give it a little more kick.  I guess I was expecting more cream cheese/strawberry taste than the brown cake taste.

This was okay. I didn't have a spring form pan - so I made in a 9X13 pan - and my cake was kind of flat and not so pretty to look at. :-( ALSO, there was a weird aftertaste that I didn't care for. I made it exactly as the recipe stated - and used really good raspberry jam - so I don't know what the taste was - but this wasn't good enough to make again for me.

This was a very tasty recipe. I actually cut down on the sour cream by a 1/4 of a cup and I thought the taste was still a little overpowering. I also added 2 TBSP of the preserve to the cream cheese mixture. All in all a pretty good recipe.

I made this coffee cake last Sunday, this was my first time to make this kind of cake. It turned out so great, I was so happy. I have never imagine I can make such a nice beautiful cake by myself. I didn't have any raspberry jam, so I used cramberry jam instead of raspberry jam, it was great, my husband and I loved it. I will make it again. Thank you very much for the wonderful cake.

This was fan-freakin-tastic!!!  I made it nut free, used vanilla extract instead of almond and that's the only change I made.  I mixed the crust up in the food processor, and the cream cheese in the mixer. It takes some time, but it really couldn't be easier, and it looks so impressive!

I made the recipe it was very simple.  The base was really thick and wasn't sure if it would turn out.  I mad it the way it was written but only used 1 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  I also drizzled a little cream cheese frosting on the top to add a little extra.  I was told that this could be given away as a gift it looked so pretty.  We did let it cool about 2 hours before cutting it and it was just fine.

I made this the day before for a friends birthday brunch.  It was fantastic!  It's very thick so I got 12 decent size servings out of it.  I used strawberry jam instead of the raspberry and it turned out well.  Although I did run the jam through the food processer so it would be smoother and easier to spread.  I really think it could have used an extra quarter of a cup of the jam.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought this was delicious.  Although I did add extra raspberry jam and some frozen raspberries.  There was a bit too much almond for my tastes; I reduced to 1 teaspoon.  I used a 9 inch springform pan and did not have the problem of the crust being too thick or the batter overflowing in the oven.  Thanks for posting!  Will definitely be making again.

I bake all the time, but just by following recipes.  I was so excited to pull this cake out of the oven, it looked absolutely perfect.  The taste was great; I used 1 tsp. of almond extract and thought that was plenty.  Next time I will have to adjust my baking time because the center clearly wasnt done enough, which was disappointing.  Definitely will make again, this recipe was easy and will make a great impression!

This was delicious!  And not too much for breakfast in the morning.  The only thing I would do next time is to add more jam into the batter and then use it again in the topping.  I felt it needed more than a half of a cup.

Overall, I had a lot of compliments!!!

The taste of this recipes is really phenomenal. All of the flavors accentuate one another perfectly and the almonds add the best crunch to the streusel topping. I did not have a 9-in springform pan so I used a glass 9x8x3 pan. Unfortunately, the middle of the cake was too doughy and the edges browned a little too fast. But the flavor...wow! A longer cooking time and foil over the edges should alleviate that in the future...or maybe a bigger pan. It makes a ton!

true to the picture, it is pretty enough. I made it for a children party, with blueberry jam: the crust is very thick and my kids and their friend just ate the filling and top, simply leaving the crust into their plates. The filling and streusel are good, nevertheless.

I made this recipe for senior citizen day at my high school.
It was very popular and I got alot of praise for it and requests for the recipe.
I had a little bit of trouble figuring out whether it was done or not and I probably should have baked it a little longer, but the gooey cream cheese in the middle just made it good and it was better than it being too dry.

This coffee cake is amazing. I combined the jam with the filling, instead of putting the jam on top, and it turned out superbly!

Huge hit!  Was just the right amount of sweetness, and not too difficult.  I do agree with letting it sit for at least a day, otherwise the extract is a bit strong.  Was voted to be a tradition, and so it will.

This coffee cake was delicious!  I substituted vanilla extract for the almond.  The crust was a little think.  I think that next time, I'll take advice from some of the other reviewers and drizzle it with a glaze.  But, there definitely will be a "next time".  This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks so much for posting it.
