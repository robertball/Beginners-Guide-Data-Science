I cut this recipe in half and ended up using an 8x8 glass baking dish. Instead of seasoning salt, I used a small amount sea salt and I added a little fresh ground pepper. My two boys, husband and dog made quick work of this. No leftovers. I really liked that I could basically scramble the ingredients and pour them into the dish, throw it in the oven and walk away and do my usual morning stuff. I will use this recipe again for sure.

I made a version of this recipe this past weekend for an extended family brunch. I saw many recipes calling for what I considered to be "too much" milk. I had seen another recipe that rather than milk, using sour cream. So I modified this recipe. I used the 24 eggs (actually used a couple extra, just cause I had them), a big "dollop" of sour cream (likely about 1/3 cup), and I whizzed the eggs and sour cream in my blender. Then to that I added shredded cheddar cheese (I used 1.5 lbs - so it was definitely more than 1.5 cups), drained jar of sliced mushrooms, a couple of shakes of hot pepper sauce, and about a lb of diced ham / bacon. I made 2 of these, so in one I used bacon, in the other I used ham. While I was prepping, I just put the 9x13 pans in the oven, each with a half stick of butter to melt, so the egg mixture went into these pans once the butter was melted. Popped the pans with the egg mixture in a 350 oven for about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. They were fabulous!!! Everyone raved about them and many want my recipe. It's easy as can be and feeds a crowd. My husband was very leery that these wouldn't be that good and wouldn't be enough. He had to eat his words (along with the eggs!) I will make this again when the occasion arises. Even the leftovers are delicious!!

It's a good recipe. The more you stir, the creamier the eggs turn out.

I really loved this recipe.  Eggs were creamy and fluffy.  It certainly didn't make the kitchen hot but did make it smell great.  For the person with the small kitchen and rated this with 1 star without trying it...shame on you!

Delicious and has many seasoning possibilities. How can a reviewer rate a dish that was never made due to the size and inconvenience of her own kitchen? ?? Not fair for the rating number.

Easy peasy...and cheesy!  Quick dish for a crowd, also good for just two if you've got a lot going on the stovetop.  Great dish to add extras (ham, onion, mushrooms, etc.)

I halved the recipe. Also used 3/4 cup milk and a heaping tablespoon of sour cream. Added diced tomato, spinach and crumbled bacon. This was very good for a Sunday breakfast. Served with English Muffin, juice and coffee. Easy to coordinate timing. Only concern was that it was quite salty. I only used 1 tsp salt. Maybe the bacon? I will make again.

Very easy, baked eggs cook up fluffy and delicious and let me get other things done while they're cooking. Lots of room for add-ins to your taste. Many boooos to the person who rated this low without even bothering to make it.

I only added a little hot sauce, but other than that, did not change anything.  It was very good.  I want the recipe for the cranberry, orange almond scones now to go with it! Lol!

The only changes I made were to make a smaller batch.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it and plan on putting it on the dinner rotation...who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?  ***Note*** Since making this initially, I want to mention I now add finely chopped green onions to the egg bake before putting it in the oven.  15 minutes then stir, then another 15 to 19 minutes more.  Fabulous.

For sure this is a recipe for a big crowd, or as someone said, when the stove top is too busy.
For 2, 4, or even 6 people, it's really not worth the trouble compared to pan-cooked scramblers.  The flavours clearly are not any better, and it is more difficult to judge "just the right moment" when the texture is perfect -- its' a nuisance to keep opening the oven door to check.  I have done them 2ce, and both times could not keep from over-cooking them.

We used the recipe as our base. A few less eggs (we were short), but adjusted the mile ratio. We added a little bacon. We will modify again because it was simple and delicious! It's a new family favorite when we have breakfast for dinner.

I scaled it down to 6 servings and used an 8x8 dish and subbed ground cayenne for Tabasco but otherwise followed the recipe. I will NEVER make my family scrambled eggs on the stove again. This is like a magical unicorn recipe that WORKS and I’m so EGGsited about it! When I told DH I had baked them in the oven he didn’t even believe me! Bonus: I baked a pan of bacon in the same oven during the last 15 minutes.

I added a carton of egg whites, a slab of chopped bacon, and used heavy cream instead of milk.  My son brought it to a morning potluck of 35 football players and it was a big hit!  Perfect recipe to feed a large party!

Very good!  Very easy!  I did cut the recipe in half since there was only 3 of us. I also added bacon and a little more cheese to finish off what little I had left. I would definitely make this again.

I felt like breakfast for dinner tonight. I scaled the recipe down to use only 6 eggs. For this amount 20 minutes of  baking,stirring halfway through it, was plenty. We loved it. I will be making again, with addition of some veggies and herbs.

Halved the recipe. Went exactly as the recipe was written the 1st time.  Added mushrooms, chopped onion, bell pepper, and crumbled bacon the second time. Excellent either way.

This was a easy, say recipe that was wonderful!  I halved the recipe, as I only had a dozen eggs and it was only to feed four people.  The recipe is for a lot of people and is my only criticism.  Having it is best way to go.
