I made this using my Ninja.   Came out pretty good. I didn't have almonds  or hempseed so I didn't include them.  This will be my Sunday afternoon treat, thanks for the recipe

This was an awesome recipe. I had to make something for my mom (she is going off sugar) and for my sister (she is going dairy free.) It takes a long time to find a recipes that don't have much sugar (or none) and has no dairy also. Also I can't have kiwi or pineapple which makes it even harder.

I liked the recipe but,I put it in the freezer so it would be more ice cream like.
