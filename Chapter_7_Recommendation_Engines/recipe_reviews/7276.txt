I've been making a cake similar to this for years. It has a few differences though. Use only 2/3 C water and 3/4 C oil. Omit lemon extract. Bake in a bundt cake pan for 40 minutes at 350. Use only 2T lemon juice for glaze. Glaze after slightly cooled. This gives a much better cake to glaze ration. Yummm!

I followed the directions to the letter and this cake was not good.  I wondered about the lemon gelatin rather than pudding, but I used it. And then the "frosting" was like liquid. There is SO MUCH sugar in this recipe, it is almost in puddles in the bottom of the pan -- the cake is wet from it. Someone tell me what I did wrong!

I made this one for a birthday and it got rave reviews.  I used a fork to poke lots of holes in the cake before covering w/ glaze.  Followed another reviewers recommendation and added a dab of butter to the glaze, along with some freshly grated lemon rind.  Fresh squeezed lemon juice made it all the more tasty.  I think this one is even better the next day, moist and more lemony.  Next time, I will make it the day before serving. Good & easy!

I'm giving this recipe four stars only b/c I made changes...it would be five stars otherwise.  For those of you who thought the cake was a bit too sweet, you may want to try using lemon flavored pudding mix instead of gelatin.  I took a box of D.H. french vanilla cake mix and added four eggs, 2/3 C oil, 1 C buttermilk (no water), and instead of lemon extract and gelatin I used the rind of one lemon, about four Tbsp. of fresh juice, and about half a package of lemon-flavored pudding as well as two heaping scoops of sour cream.  This 'softened' the lemon flavor and didn't taste too sweet.  Lemon tends to amplify sugar in any recipe, so I say to cut down on the tartness in the cake and just keep the glaze really sweet.  This was basically a lemon-flavored pudding/pound cake that was sooo moist and very good with the simply lemon glaze on top.

Yummy. I did substitute lemon cake mix and doubled the glaze/frosting because I wanted a more intense lemon flavor.  Everyone loved it.

I love lemon cake and am somewhat of a lemon cake snob.  Must be lemony with right mix of sweet/tart.  No heavy icing.  MUST be moist.  I would love to be able to make everything from scratch but then we would never eat around here!  This cake is AWESOME!!!  I always get a little worried when trying a new recipe in case it is all hype and doesn't deliver.  This delivers.  Don't know why anyone would rate it not good unless they did something wrong.  Of course I made some slight changes.  No extract - fresh lemon juice (4T).  Used the DH Classic Yellow mix, instant lemon pudding.  I was a little worried it wouldn't be lemony enough when I tested the batter.  Not to worry.  Also for the icing, used just the lemon juice and confec. sugar (mix well) and added lots of pulp and about 1-2t of zest.  It is a runny icing so SLOWLY drizzle.  Made it the night before as a bundt cake for an afternoon meeting the next day.  SO MOIST. Very lemony.  The icing seeped into the cake and amazing.  It's all gone!  I think that I would try it with lemon cake mix to see if that made it even better but not sure.  It pretty well rocks!  Did I say I liked the cake??  Don't know why the icing in the photo on the site is so white though.  Mine didn't look that way. You should give this a try.

I would make this again.  I didn't have and lemon extract so I substituted the juice of one lemon and added a bit of grated lemon rind to the cake mix.  It turned out very moist and lemony!  I would make this again.

I made this recipe with lemon cake mix, and didn't add any lemon extract. It turned out moist and delicious. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again.

This Lemon cake is soo moist and delicious, but i left out the lemon extract and used 3/4 cups of lemon juice. Use cool whip for the topping. to decorate put sliced lemons at the corners. You'll love it even more than the original.

I don't use cake mixes except for this cake.  I got the recipe from my MIL years ago and it's been a family favorite since then.  I do use the lemon zest finely grated from the lemons in the topping and add them to the cake batter for an additional lemon boost.  What I love about this cake is the sheen the jello gives to the cake crumb.  It's so pretty and almost tranluscent looking.  Delicious and quick to put together.  It's great as a base for strawberries or blueberry compote ladled over a slice with some whipped cream dolloped on top!

This is the recipe that I used while my children were growing up...The only Variation that I made is to adjust the oil & water, 2/3 c. of water & 3/4 c. of oil...Everything else is the same, (eggs, jello , & cake mix)..I Love to make this in a 9 x 13 cake pan, & after the cake is cooled somewhat, I poke holes with a fork, in the cake, & then pour Glaze (omit lemon extract, just lemon juice) over the top....I then refrigerate it so it is a Refreshing Addition on a Hot Summer Day!!...Perfect to take to all of your Family Get-Togethers & Potlucks...Make sure that you take the recipe along, because you will definitely be asked for it!!...

Easy to put together and bakes up beautifully! I followed the recipe as stated above and baked using a greased 10" tube pan. Done in 50 minutes. Used 1 cup powdered sugar, 2.5 T lemon juice plus 2 drops natural lemon extract. Using a bamboo skewer to poke the cake on the top, the cake was glazed while hot. Moist and yummy! Thanks!

MY GRANDMOTHER WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN WHO MADE EVRYTHING FROM SCRATCH, NO REALLY, EVERYTHING.  SHE KEPT AN ORANGE OR LEMON POUND CAKE MADE ALL THE TIME.  AFTER SHE GOT SICK, I STARTED TRYING TO FIND HER RECIPE TO NO AVAIL AND THEN FOUND OUT NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN HER MIX ONE UP TO REMEMBER THE INGREDIENTS.  AFTER HER DEATH WE FINALLY FOUND HER RECIPE AND THIS WAS IT, HER DEEP DARK SECRET THAT STARTED WITH A MIX.  YOU CAN USE STRAWBERRY OR ORANGE ALSO AND ITS GREAT WITHOUT THE GLAZE AS WELL.

Growing up this was one of my favorite desserts.  My family calls it Lemon Suprise Cake.  We too use lemon cake mix.  If you want to make it extra fantastic, let the cake cool until it sets up a bit (15-20mins) then poke holes all over with a fork or skewer and pour the glaze all over (I double the glaze).  It soaks into the cake and makes it even more moist and delicious!

I changed it and it was great..probably great as it, but, worked with what I had.  I used black cherry jello and omitted the lemon extract.  Followed rest of cake recipe.  On glaze..I only used 2 tbsp of lemon juice..that was plenty.  I poked holes all in the top of the cake before drizzling on.  This was very good.  Probably good with other flavors of jello too..I am going to try more.

I substituted a small box of instant lemon pudding for the lemon gelatin and added a small amount of lemon juice for the lemon extract. I only used 1 1/2 T of lemon juice for the frosting and then finished up the frosting with milk (I added just enough milk for it to become frosting). It was very moist and just lemonly enough w/out becoming a cake that has lemon taking over.

Like so many others, I modified this recipe to our tastes.  I did use the yellow cake mix, but I used 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice in place of the water, 2 T fresh lemon zest and 1/2 t of extract.  1/2 cup oil and 1/4 cup greek yogurt in place of all oil.  Thanks for the easy, versatile recipe.

This is good; however, I love love lemon/tart desserts...so I added the juice of one lemon and the zest to a Lemon cake mix. Omitted the extract and use the juice of two fresh lemons the zest to the powder sugar for the glaze. Huge hit. Great recipe and yes the lemon jello works.

Read reviews and made some changes. I don't usually use boxes for cakes but I was in a hurry to whip up a treat. I added lemon zest and used pudding mix! I also increased the lemon extract! I had some fresh blueberries so I added them. The kids made fresh whipped cream to put on top!! My husband made a face when he saw I was using a boxed cake, but after dinner I caught him in the kitchen stealing another bite! So I would recommend this cake in a pinch! Thanks for the recipe and reviewers advice!

Perhaps the worst cake I've ever made. It stuck to the pan, came out in pieces and the icing and glaze take 5 cups of conf. sugar -- way too sweet. The texture is like gravel and its dry. It uses 8 egg yolks and no egg white so it lacks a soft consistency. There isn't a single thing about this recipe I liked.

This is a great recipe..but the version I have used is a tad different...while the cake is still warm you should poke it with a fork all over the top..THEN...SLOWLY pour icing on and some sees into the cake..always a family favorite !!

This is luscious! I made it in a 9 x 13" cake pan and it fell in the middle, but was still delicious! Next time I'll use a bundt pan. The icing was so yummy on the cake, because the sugar crusted up a bit and added a really great texture to the cake. I'll definitely be making this again.

Easy and delicious. This lemon cake always turns out. I have been making this for a while and anyone that likes lemon likes this cake.

I purchase the lemon cake mix and drop the extract because lemon extract isn't used for anything else in this house. I also use fresh lemon in the glaze. DELISH!

Excellen and flavor of this lemon cake.  I like a tangy lemon flavor and this is it.  My grandma used to make a cake very similar to this in a 9x13 pan, she topped it with the glaze and then cream cheese frosting, it was amazing!  This is very similar to the lemon cake at Starbucks.

My mother used to make this, I was looking for the recipe and made it this weekend, it was gone in two days, I don't why someone would say this is too sweet, perfect balance of lemon and sweet, great! Substitued lemon juice for extract, 1/4 cup.

Very moist and lemony.  I think 4 tbsp lemon juice in the glaze was too much.  I wanted a slightly thicker glaze that would stay on the cake better.  Oh and I didn't have lemon extract so I substituted with lemon juice.

This cake WAS very easy, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  It was moist enough, but overall it was kind of bland.  Not worth the oil/fat content. Maybe with applesauce and extra lemon juice instead....

This was easy and the taste was awesome.  As suggested, I made it a day ahead, doubled the glaze and added the melted butter.  I think I'll try a bundt pan next time just to make it more festive.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

With this recipe being old be aware that cake mixes are smaller now as are jello mixes.  I used the smaller yellow cake mix and the lemon pudding mix and it came out great!  I also used more real lemon juice instead of the extract.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this the same way for years except omitted the lemon extract & used  mix of fresh lemon & bottled lemon juice for a more natural lemon taste. The other thing I did was to  grate the lemon & put1/2 in the mix & remainder in the glaze. On this cake photo, please note, I added a  lemon pie filling over the glaze.  This made cake very rich & I was able to serve more people by slicing them smaller for a party. I got rave reviews!

I made this exactly as directed, and it didn't come out of the pan.  I have a nice non-stick fluted pan, and I even used non-stick spray to be extra sure.  When I finally did remove it, the appearance was ruined, and then the cake itself crumbled.  It was not dry, yet it was still crumbly.  It was received well enough, but no one raved about it, and very few people finished their piece.

My kids love this. I've made it several times over the past few years - it's quick and easy when you need a potluck dessert. I only use 2T lemon juice for the topping - otherwise, it would be too runny, but I've only made it in a bundt, runny might be fine in a 9X13.

A friend of ours had had surgery and I took this cake as a get well offering. My husband is not a lemon lover, so I was skeptical. Everyone loved it!!! It was easy to make and took no time at all. Since we left the rest there, he requested I make one for home. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!

I used this for the cake - I used 1 pkg for lemon jello-and no lemon extract (didn't have any), but I did have a real lemon- and I squeezed all of the juice into the batter along with the zest of the lemon.  VERY delicious!

This cake is a favorite of our family. My mother made this for years and her recipe has a few additions which make all the difference, Sub apricot nectar for the water and separate eggs, beat egg whites and fold in to make a light and intensely favored lemon cake. Wonderful!

This cake is fantastic.  I made it as written except taking a suggestion mentioned numerous times in reviews of using a lemon cake mix instead of yellow.  This tastes almost like fresh lemon bars.  It is so moist and just sweet and tart enough.  Delicious!

you guys don't laugh at me but i didn't read the recipe right and i put all the ingredients in the cake using a lemon cake mix and the bunt cake fell in; but it was the most fantastic lemony cake i ever had. i made it again and use less than a 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar in it and  2 round pans it didn't fall in but it wasn't fluffy but it was still fantastic. oh yeah i used pudding both times and not gelatin. next time i'll try it with the gelatin. this is a keeper!

Moist?  No.  Greasy?  Yes.  Easy recipe, and I can see how many people would love it, but it is not one I enjoyed.

This recipe was really good, but I did get lazy and just used lemon frosting, instead of making the glaze.  Still a really good cake.  Will make it again and make the glaze the next time around.

excellent flavor.  The frosting was a little to runny.  It ran off the cake and onto the counter. But once it dried it was wonderful.

Hate to say this but I didn't care for this cake.  I loved the glaze though.  So sad, I was totally jazzed up but then disappointed.  There is another lemon cake recipe from this site I wanted to try but I didn't have any apricot nectar on hand so I chose this one.  At least other reviewers are enjoying this cake.

I have made this cake often from my sister's recipe.  We use lemon cake mix and omit extract.  We made it with raspberry flavored jello tonight and my son asked if I could make it for his birthday.  Always a hit.

I love this cake! (As do my co-workers and boyfriend.)THe only changes I made were, I used a lemon box cake, and I didn't have any lemon extract, so I squeezed a bit of lemon juice in the batter.

I made this for Easter, and it is wonderful! I wondered if a yellow cake mix and lemon gelatin mix would be an odd combination, but with the glaze, it was very lemony. It is even more moist the next few days. My family loved it!

This cake was awesome!  Made it for Easter and everyone loved it.  To the reviewer who said the recipe needs to say temp and how long to bake...
It says bake according to package directions.  You should read something all the way through and actually make it before you review it unfairly.

I've been looking for a recipes to make a great lemon cake from scratch for awhile, and have not come up with anything close to being this good.  Moist, very lemony, and easy.  No one will ever know it's from a cake mix.

I made a few  mistakes when I made this....but it was Delish - this cake was gobbled up and people were fighting over the crumbs. In future, I'd repeat how I made it. I mistakenly bought jello pudding not gelatin. I used real lemon juice not extract.  I made the cake part with yellow cake with pudding added....then added the lemon pudding , 4 TBS fresh lemon juice....a large dollop of light sour cream. Baked at 350 for 35 mins - came out perfect. I iced it when still hot, but might have been too hot as it melted the icing so it looked clear not white. In future I'd double the icing (ice warm so si it absorbs in...and then have some to ice and give it the nice white iced top) - but I was out of confection so made do. This cake was super moist. Great balance of lemon and sweet and really easy. Crowd pleaser. Should have made 2 cakes!

I made this for the first (and definitely NOT last) time yesterday to take to a pool party.  It was super easy to make and a GIGANTIC success! There was one change I needed to make with regard to the size cake mix.  The recipe calls for an 18.25 ounce package of yellow cake mix.  Not sure when this recipe was originally made, but I couldn't find ANY cake mix boxes that were 18.25 oz.  They are all now 15.25 oz.  However, I did use the same amounts of extract, gelatin, oil, water and eggs that the recipe called for.  Another change to the recipe was how long I baked it. I used a bundt pan and the box directions said to bake between 39 - 43 minutes. .  But I checked it at 35 minutes and it was done to perfection. Also, the "frosting" should be classified as a "glaze" because that's what it really is.  I'll most definitely be making this again.

I had 20 lb bucket of Deli filling so I didn't measure out exactly 21 Oz I put roughly 3 cups in and it didn't bake to a springform consistency it kind of got bubbly so I think I put in too much filling or used the wrong grade of filling.

The cake is absolutely delicious! I didn’t use the frosting though, instead I used a recipe for cream cheese lemon frosting. I didn’t like the frosting that it made. It was too runny.

Easy to make, moist, and full of flavor. Not too lemony, and better than just plain plain vanilla cake. I added jam in between layers for extra goodness. Yummy.

The recipe was unclear if  lemon Jello pudding or lemon jello gelatin was used. I made it with pudding and it was perfect. In addition I omitted the lemon extract and just used lemon juice. When icing the cake the recipe states ice it when it's still hot, although by the time it cools the cake looks unfinished. I made the icing again and re-iced the cake after having been refrigerated all night. This was a huge hit for our United Way bake sale.

We loved this cake. It turned out perfectly! The only thing I changed was the lemon icing. With 4 tbsp lemon juice, it made the icing way too thin, in my opinion. I like the icing thicker and be able to see it on the cake... I also cooked it at 335 instead of 350, other than that I followed everything on the recipe.

Used a Lemon cake mix and the 2/3 c water plus the other cake ingredients.  Did leave out the lemon flavouring.  Also for the  drizzle used just 2Tbsp of the  fresh lemon juice.  Thanks to the reviews  for this.  Love it and hubby loved too.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will try it with other flavours of jello .

I made this twice with a few changes.  First I squeezed 4 large lemons.  Instead of water I used the lemon juice.  Also,, instead of the vegetable oil I used the fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Baked for 40 minutes was perfect.  For the icing I eliminated the extract, used 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar and used the remaining lemon juice.  I waited for the cake to cool were it was just a little warm then added the glaze and was not as runny.  Loved this cake it is a keeper it is now even a little more healthy.  Enjoy :)

I was very disappointed with the glaze! It was totally runny and soaked right into the cake. A lot of it ended up covering the plate. I wonder if it had too much lemon juice. Another reviewer mentioned using only half the lemon juice. If I make this again, I would try that. Very easy recipe. I used lemon cake as I did not have lemon extract. Cake tasted good.

Made some changes based on what I had on hand.  Used a butter flavor cake mix, a box of instant lemon pudding instead of jello, replaced the oil with softened butter and since I had no lemon extract, replaced 1/4 of the water with freshly squeezed lemon juice and added a little lemon zest to the batter.  Baked in a bundt pan per the cake box directions.  I went in a whole different direction with the icing.  Combined a cup of regular sugar with 1/4 cup of water in a pan.  Brought to a boil and simmered for 5 minutes, stirring constantly to make sure sugar was dissolved.  Removed from heat and added 1/2 cup of limoncello.  When the cake was finished put bundt pan on rack to cool.  After 10 minutes, ran a knife to loosen cake in pan, then used a skewer to poke holes all over cake.  Poured the limoncello mixture all over the cake.  Left in pan to cool a bit more.  Turned onto platter.  Moist buttery lemon finish!

We tried making this cake, for the first time. We cooked it, but the cake would stay liquid. Then we turned the heat up, and the top of the cake burnt. So then we left the temp at 360 F and eventually, the cake cooked in the middle. We used brown sugar instead of confectioner's sugar, and the icing tasted amazing.
The cake is good, after we got the temp right, and we would do it again :)

Have been using this or a similar recipe for years & everyone loves it! It is very good made with orange jello/extract as well. Naturally you would use orange juice with the confectioners sugar in the glaze if you choose to make orange. Or if you have a lemon or orange cake mix you do not need the extract at all.

I made this cake as directed, except that I substituted lemon cake mix, which should only affect taste, not texture. The texture is what I really didn't like about this cake. It didn't bake up (rise) very well, and there were a lot of air-bubbles in the mix. The result was a moist enough cake, but somewhat odd in texture. I think the jello (which I too questioned, but also thought might be interesting) gave it a strange (and hard to describe) texture that wasn't for me.

This is great as written.  I like the sour of the lemon and the sweetness of the icing.  I added the zest of 1 lemon to the icing and as many as 4-5 lemons (zest) to the cake itself.  Stong lemon flavor.

I'm a little dissapointed in this recipe because it has rave reviews.  Slighty better than the lemon cake out of a a box but I'm not quite sure what all of the excitement is about because as said before it has a distinct box cake look & taste. Also the glaze is extremely watery as written and I am sure that the cake will be soggy in the morning =(

LOVED this. Brought it to our Wine Club and it was a HUGE hit. I used only 2/3 c water and kept the extract. I added 1 cup chopped walnuts to bottom of bundt pan, baked at 350 for 40 mins. Let it cool for 30 mins then poked holes used 1 c powdered sugar w 2T lemon juice and zest. Also added 2 containers fresh raspberries in center and around edges. It was beautiful and extremely moist and refreshing. Great recipe for potluck or party.

Used to make a similar recipe as a kid but since then I had forgotten how...made this recipe for fathers day, and my husband nearly finished it all by himself. It's exactly how I remembered it! Perfect moisture and holds together well. Will keep this recipe for all of my fruity cakes.  Trying it out on a strawberry cake today. Should be scrumptous!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. We loved it. This cake was excellent. Even my husband who is not big on cakes in general ate two peices every day! I used a lemon cake mix but was out of lemon jello so used the strawberry I had on hand then followed the recipe exactly for the rest of it. Who would have thought it would still be so great, but it was! Cake was light moist and tangy. I can only imagine how good it will be with all lemon. I am going to make it again this weekend when my sister comes from Colorado! Hmmm maybe strawberry cake mix with strawberry jello, gosh can't wait to try lots of different combinations. LOL Thanks again for sharing this.

This is a very easy recipe.  Like others I used a lemon cake mix and I also added fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemon rind to the mix, but did not use lemon extract.  For the glaze, I also used fresh lemon juice along with lemon rind and a little heavy cream along with the powdered sugar.  I did not follow the amounts as per the recipe, but just used enough of the 3 ingredients just stated until it reached the consistency and flavor I wanted.  I poured a little on while the cake was hot, then after it cooled I put the rest on.  It came out nice and very lemony.  And my entire house smelled lovely!!

This was a great recipe!!! I used 1/2 package of lemon pudding and 1/2 package of lemon gelatin..Maid he cake extremely moist and spongey. Also added 1 tablespoon of flour to the glaze, stopped it from being runny and didn't change the flavor at all. Will def use the recipe again.

This cake was disapointing. Nothing was as advertised. The only lemony part was the "frosting" which was watery. It just made a sticky mess.

This cake was good and easy to make. My family and friends enjoyed it. However, I will agree with the review from Kaybee stating it tasted like a box cake.

I thought this cake would taste better than boxed cake, but to me, it tasted the same as a regular cake from cake mix.. EVERYONE loved it! But I was hoping for better.. Thanks V Monte!

This dessert was SO good!  Big hit at the dinner party I took it to.  Will serve with a light whipped white frosting as an option next time, for variety.

Very Easy! I also used a lemon cake mix and skipped the lemon extract. Used fresh lemon juice in the glaze and served with fresh whipped cream. 
Tasty!

I made this cake for Easter Sunday. I used lemon mix instead of yellow b/c my family loves lemon. The cake was good. It was best right out of the oven and then a few days later. The days between, I didn't really care for it. I also loved the icing...I doubled it b/c I loved it so much.
