This made for a pretty good salsa.  I used 1 can of organic small diced tomatoes with jalepeno's and half of a whole tomatoe because I was afraid it would have a metal taste from the can and I am glad I did because I tasted the tomatoes from the can before I added them in the bowl and it did taste metalic.  The next day the salsa tasted even better.  It is great because if you use the tomatoes already with the jalepeno's, everything else is usually already in your cabinet or fridge and you can make it pretty quick.

I made this for an Easter fiesta.  It was easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  The only problem was the canned tomatoes were so big tht it was hard to get them on the chips.  Next time I will cut them smaller.

I altered this recipe a tiny bit because I'm one of those few people who cringe at the taste of cilantro.  I used fresh lemon basil (it was all I had on hand) and everyone loves the recipe!  Thank you for sharing.

I used fire-roasted tomatoes and half a can of LaVictoria green chilies. I used more garlic, added some cilantro, lime juice, cumin and oregano. This was hugely budget friendly, I got almost a whole Ball quart jar full! I did run it through my blender using the ice-crushing feature to give it a more uniform consistancy plus it cut my work in half. Having two boys in my face constantly, that's a blessing. This whole recipe didn't cost me more than a dollar and a small 8 oz. container of good salsa is almost five dollars! NOTE: You're best off making this as early as you can. The longer it sits, the better it tastes.

Great recipe but you can subsitite Rotel tomatoes w/ green chili's. They also have them now w/ the cilantro and lime juice too. This recipe is almost exact to mine.

I think the recipe is calling for the Rotel mixture of tomatoes and green chilies not canned tomatoes.

I love this recipe! It's very similar to one I've been making for years. I use the petite diced tomatoes so the chunks aren't to big. And depending on my mood I drain all of the juice for a thicker chunkier salsa or I keep the juice an pulse it in a blender or food processor to get a picante sauce. I also add green pepper and a diced tomatillo to it. It is better the next day so if you are entertaining make it the night before so the flavors meld together. It's just a great easy recipe. You can also substitute 1 large ripe tomato and a can of green chilies if you want.

This was good, but I did encounter the metallic taste like Jinelle did from the canned tomatoes. I just made this today, so we'll see if the taste improves by tomorrow. Overall, great simple recipe!

we thought this was wonderful.  not your regular store bought but who really wants all of those extra things they put in that are bad for you!?!  the only thing we did different is put it in the food processor with a couple short/quick spins.  we did this because i'm not a big vegie lover, especially in chunks.  so if you don't like chunky salsa just give it a quick whirl a couple times and it's perfect!!  taste even better when you pull it out of the fridge the next day and let all the flavors meld together!!  thanks!!

A very flavorful and zippy blend of ingredients.  I would suggest, however, draining the canned tomatoes and chiles, as the salsa was a little too runny with the juices left in.

This is a great recipe, but using fresh tomatoes only adds a few minutes to the prep time and makes it taste so much better.

This has thus far been my favorite salsa I've tried from this site. I was interested in the fact that it begins with a can of Rotel instead of some other canned tomatoes, because we prefer to use Rotel whenever almost any recipe calls for canned tomatoes, and the same is true here. I did up the spices for our tastes (lots more onion, cilantro, and garlic, and no added salt) but the base recipe here is definitely our favorite thus far. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this recipe about ten minutes ago. It is a bit spicy, but my boyfriend likes very spicy food, so I am hoping the flavors mesh well. I drained the tomatoes and added a hint of lime juice. I happen to have cilantro growing in my garden, so hopefully I will be able to taste the freshness in the salsa. Next time, I will use fresh tomatoes and possibly omit the chilies. This seems like the type of dish that gets better with age (I hope)

I made this salsa and my kids raved about it being better than our local mexican restaurant salsa! I did change things up a bit based on what I had on hand at the time. I used Rotel w/Chiles and also added Ortega Mild green sauce for flavor. I keep jarred jalapenos on hand because I use them so often and they work great in this recipe. I used sea salt but no pepper, no olive oil.  I made it a few days ahead and it actually got better over time.

Made as directed just did not measure out red onion or jalapeno peppers.  Hubby ate half of it before it ever made it to the fridge.  :)

good stuff!  I had dehydrated jalepeno and cilantro from Penzeys that I used.  It used up a little of the liquid from the tomatoes.  Added a dquirt of lime juice to it and it was great

Good, easy and fast.  Per some reviews about it being too runny, drained the tomatoes almost completely and then squeezed in some fresh lime juice. Dumped everything in my food processor and pulsed a couple of times -- textured was still a little chunky, perfect for dipping. There was a metallic taste at first, but once it sat for a couple of hours, that went away! Will definitely make again.

Ok so I tried this recipe & I didn't care for this recipe too much. I didn't like the green chiles and I have never heard of putting olive oil in salsa. This recipe was just ok. I really love the Speedy Salsa recipe on here .. it's 5 stars and is the most delicious and addicting salsa on this site. I think I will stick to that recipe from now on. Kudos though to you as it wasn't terrible at all.. just different. =)

Very good recipe.It was exactly what i was looking for.I just wish I would have paid attention to the ingredients and took out the seeds from the jalapeno because it was pretty hot.So happy it was what I was looking for though.

This was perfect.  I used a 14.5 ounce can of no salt added diced tomatoes because it is what I had on hand.  It tasted great and was easy to throw together... cheap too.  I don't think I'll buy salsa again in a jar if I can help it!

This was my second try at home  made salsa with home grown ingredients. It was the best! The flavors melded together perfectly. There was no acidiy tomato taste like my first try. I will add a little more jalapeno to it next time. I think because my peppers where so small, they were not very hot. I like a little bit of a kick to my salsa but I like to also get the salsa taste. I hope it tastes as good after being canned. Now that I've found the perfect recipe, I'm going to try canning. Thanks Kim, this is a keeper!
