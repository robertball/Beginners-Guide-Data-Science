Well, I made the HIGH-fat version of this dessert and, boy, does it ever rate 5 stars!! I'm not sure how the low-fat one will turn out, but the ingredients I had on hand were not calorie counters! I actually used berry fusion flavor jello and I think you could use any flavor you wanted for this one.  It set up very well and is the creamiest tasting cheesecake dessert I think I've every had. Note: if you're not pinching calories, go ahead and make a regular graham cracker crust, this idea of the cooking spray and sprinkling of the crumbs stinks--most of it stayed on the pie plate. This would also be great without the crust, chilled in individual cups. I'm guessing the "lighter" version is pretty good, too :-)

This is a great low-carb treat for those watching their sugar intake and waistline. The "crust" can be skipped completely. I like to add one teaspoon of orange extract to mine, that's the only change I make, other than skipping the crust. This is a favorite of ours, even my husband who can't tell that it has cottage cheese in it. It's almost like a Dreamsicle/Creamsicle.

I love this dessert. I often change the jello flavor and garnish with the corresponding fruit. When I use lime or lemon jello I add a little of the zest and it helps perk up the flavor.

Made this exactly as written. It was great. My 16 year old son loved it also and couldn't tell it was fat free! It was even better on the second day as the flavors melded togather. Will make again.

I made this recipe using lemon Jello and full-fat cottage and cream cheeses.  The taste of the cottage cheese came thru a bit too much which made the flavor only so-so.  However, the flavor improved the next day.  The texture was excellent--very light and fluffy--and it cut and came out of the pan very cleanly.  I plan to try again using pineapple Jello and only 3/4 C cottage cheese.

The end result was delicious, and I can't believe that this is low calorie/fat.  Couple of issues: (1) my electric mixer didn't fully blend the cottage cheese, I had to transfer everything to the food processor.  The food processor made everything light and fluffy.  (2) I would definitely spray the graham cracker crumbs with pam and bake them in the oven for five minutes.  Other then these two minor changes this was excellent!  Highly recommended if you want to eat low fat dessert!

I made exactely like the recipe stated and I have to say I really thought it was bitter.  I have no intention of making this again unless it is the "high fat" version.

DELICIOUS and SO simple to make!!! I didn't want to buy a whole box of graham crackers, so bought the box of crumbs. I also used 2 mini pans, so figured 1/2 tbsp of crumbs per inch of the pan (so 3" pan = 1 1/2 tbsp of crumbs) As I had a LOT of filling left over, I seperated the rest in tupperware containers for lunch during the week. As I had some nice strawberries already, I went with a strawberry flavour Jell-o and it was delicious! I also added some fresh strawberries when I blended the cheese and it gave a more authentic berry flavour. I also don't like the Whip Topping, so used low fat Greek Yogurt and it was very creamy and I imagine the consistency is similar- plus Greek Yogurt is so healthy for you! I look forward to making this during the holiday season!
