These were a big hit! I didn't have peanuts, so I used peanut butter chips.  I also didn't feel like chopping chocolate, so I used semi sweet choc chips.  Turned out great!  Be forewarned, these are messy!  But hey, nothing that can't be fixed by licking your fingers! Will make again!

I didn't care for the bars very much. They're dense, very rich and taste more like an overcooked brownie than cake. A lot of people mentioned it being a messy and/or time-consuming preparation. I didn't have a problem with either so HERE ARE SOME TIPS!: add an extra 2-3 tablespoons of milk to the cake and butter mixture. Put peanut butter in bowl and microwave approximately 45 seconds or until liquefied. Make sure no hard lumps begin to form as it has overheated. Add milk and mix with rubber scraper until blended. Spoon (use 2) marshmallow creme directly from the jar onto the peanut butter mixture.  I inadvertently left off the peanuts and chopped chocolate and I'm glad I did. I can't imagine another ingredient being added to the mix! If I make these again I will leave out the peanut butter. I'm a fan, but I found the flavor to be overpowering and out of place. I chose to use a smaller pan for the sake of wanting added thickness. I think these bars would definitely taste better thinner so I'd stick to the 9x13!

We love peanut butter/chocolate 'anything'  but think that this one would be better without the peanut butter layer, and maybe with just a handful of peanut butter chips scattered on top (we used both). The peanut butter layer just tastes out of place to us in this one and I'm not sure why. This is very, very rich so a very small piece will go a long way. I cut the servings for the kids extra small and they still left a little on their plates. I will definately try this again because the devil's food chocolate/marshmallow fluff was delicious, but with a couple of tweaks next time. We did enjoy trying a new recipe.

I really enjoyed these, at least the way I made them.  I used strong coffee instead of milk because chocolate always tastes better when you add coffee.  Skipped the peanut butter layer since I was out.  Instead I dropped spoonfuls of marshmallow fluff, lightly sprinkled it with chopped walnuts, dropped pieces of the remaining brownie batter on top, then sprinkled just a few semisweet and white chocolate chips before baking the 2nd time.  Pretty darned good.

First of all... be ready for a messy prep... I purchased a devils food dry cake mix as directed and attempted to mix the melted butter and milk in with the mix by hand.. MISTAKE #1.. extremely difficult took forever. I ended up adding approx 1/3 more milk to the mix and finally ended up with a nice smooth consistency. I baked in a 9x13 glass pyrex for 10 mins until the center almost was set (as directed) & attempted to make the peanut butter sauce.. RIDICULOUS! The peanut butter (I used Skippy) just became this really coarse mixture which im sure tasted equally as bad.. so instead I trashed that and poured 1/2 cup heavy cream over low heat, added 1/2 cup toffee chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and reduced the peanut butter to 1/3.. Mixed it all together until i had a nice velvety consistency, let it cool down a bit, spooned it over and spread it onto the brownie base. (I may or may not have tasted the sugary concoction and it may or may not have been AMAZZZING) Man. If you never worked with Marshmallow cream before (especially in high altitude) you are in for a treat... NOT! Extremely viscous and annoying to try and spread.. so i put it in a piping bag without a tip and piped it on top and then I also topped them off with some mini milk chocolate chips and scrapped the remaining brownie dough.. Towards the end of the baking time i broiled the mallow top for a min to get some crunchiness too. Froze then cut.. VERY DENSE & RICH

I saw the picture of these yesterday and ran to the store immediately to get the stuff to make them because they looked so good. They however were not as good as they looked, they were SO MUCH BETTER!!!! These are to die for. I used peanut butter chips and semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the peanuts and chocolate squares since my son does not like peanuts but loves peanut butter. I put the chips on the last few minutes of baking so they didn't melt all the way to make it more chunky but that is just a preference of mine. To address an issue another reviewer made about the spreading of the peanut butter: I too had problems at first and put spoonfuls on but then decided to try and spread again. I used my fingers/hands to press and spread and found that though it was messy, it worked so much better and didn't pull the crust up with it when spreading and still covered the whole crust. I think this was the way to go and recommend this method of spreading to anyone who makes these. As other reviewers have said...very messy to make, not difficult, or so I didn't think so but messy and messy to eat but SO worth every minute of it! A definite favorite in my house for many years to come. Make these bars today...I promise you will not be disappointed. Thankd Lisa D for the pictures because without the pictures I don't think I would have ever tried these. If a picture is worth a 1000 words than 1000 deliciouses would describe these.

My kids and I thought this was only so/so.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares.  Maybe it was something we did?  Thanks but no thanks!

these rich brownie bars are addicting and very messy like others have mentioned. i followed the recipe pretty close but did change a few things. I decided i wanted a thicker brownie so i baked them in a smaller pan than suggested. i also noticed that if you cool the brownies 5 minutes instead of 3 the peanut butter is much easier to spread. i let the brownies cool completely before cutting but still found them too gooey to cut so i put them in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and they were perfect! i will definitely make this again

Super delicious and rich, perfect with coffee. I have some people coming for dinner and had decided to skip making dessert... until I saw Lisa D's tempting picture of these on the homepage and read I had all the ingredients on hand. Spooning(wrestling) the mallow cream on I figured mini-mallows would be a good substitute, but the cream cooks up so sweet and gooey I think losing it would be a mistake. I will make these again without a single change, cook time/temp was perfect for me, thank you so much for sharing.

I'm giving these a 5 for taste and aesthetics. They are adorable and delicious! I though they were kind of a pain in the butt to make, though. The taste is well worth the trouble. I will likely make these again.

OMG, are you kidding me with these things?  So rich and gooey.  A big hit with my whole family.  That being said, these were a bit messy to prepare. The peanut butter and milk mixture didn't just spread onto the hot cake.  It would have destroyed the cake, so I dolloped on the PB, then I dolloped on the marshmallow creme--as much as marshmallow creme can be dolloped.  It was a gooey mess.  I then topped it with the remaining batter and sprinkled with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I thought that sounded better than peanuts. I have a feeling my boys will be requesting these again, but next time, I think I'll leave out the peanut butter.  It canceled out the marshmallow taste.  Might be good with caramel instead.

These were very good.I didn't have devils food cake so I subbed regular chocolate cake.  Not sure if that made a difference. Sprinkled peanut butter morsels and chocolate chip morsels in last 10 mins of baking. Very rich and delicious!
