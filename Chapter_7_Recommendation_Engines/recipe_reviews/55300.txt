I took these to my annual church group cookie exchange and everyone raved about them. All the women wanted the recipe. I had gotten it out of a magazine and lost it. That is why I am here on the Hershey site and so very pleased to find the recipe available to share.

Very good.  Mine were messy when I took them out of the muffin pan (crumbly but still intact) so I put them into Christmas mini muffin liners and it's no problem.  They are very rich!  I did not get 3 dozen, more like 28.

These took a bit of time to press the dough into the mini-cups and then fill each one with a tiny bit of the chip mixture.  But it was great fun with a group of girls at a baking day and they are really yummy!  Good chocolate & peanut butter flavor without being too rich.  Perfect for the holidays or a special event.  Will make again.
