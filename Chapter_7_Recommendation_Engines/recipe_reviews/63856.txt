I don't eat chili but my husband said this was delicious. He doesn't like tomatoes so I substituted a can of tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes. I also added a bit of red pepper to spice it up a little. Will make again for sure.

This  is the first time ever that I made Chili.  this is a very simple easy recipe and my husband loved it.  I didn't put in as much chili powder because he does not like real spicy food and I was afraid to put the full amount in but he said it was perfect.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

This is a great basic chili recipe (I made it exactly as shown).  Serve it with shredded cheese, sour cream and saltine crackers, and it's a really good meal that appeals to the whole family.

It was good, but the beans were a bit mushy.

Pretty good. I replaced the can of tomatoes with a jar of Trader Joes salsa. It was a tad bit on the spicy side, but consistency was great. Next time, I'll reduce the chili powder if I use salsa.

Fantastic - kids love it cold! Here is someting if people (kids) do not like the heat: Eliminate chii powser and diced tomatoes - change to Red Gold diced tomatoes with cilantro & lime.  Best part? Add 1 can vacuum packed corn.  This latter addition was on the original recipe on the can. The corn makes it, I assure you.

Good chili recipe. Needs a little more heat.
