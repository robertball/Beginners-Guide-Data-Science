I planned a simple seafood main dish with subtle seasoning for dinner and I wanted  a rice side dish with some pizzazz and a little oomph to complement it. This was just what I had in mind.  I loved the festive  and vibrant color from the peppers, and the herbs (I used fresh basil, parsley and thyme, preferring their milder flavor to that of the oregano) gave it the punch of fresh flavor I was after. The addition of the wine was the perfect finishing touch.  The bottom line?  This is a perfect assembly of ingredients, taking the usual ho-hum side dish rice to something unique and special.

This is a solid, tasty recipe.  I made only minor changes, using yellow, orange and red peppers and omitting the green and fresh basil in place of dried.  It smelled so good as it simmered.  I had one chicken cutlet I needed to cook so I cut it in strips and added it to the peppers  to make a complete meal.  Thanks, Joey!

5 STARS!  Tonight I was baking fish and looking for a different side dish.  Hubby loves rice so I was pretty sure he would like this.  I made the mistake of chopping the onions and peppers together so I stirred the peppers in with the onions from the start.  It wasn't a problem.  I didn't have any red peppers so when the dish was all finished I added a few seeded and diced grape tomatoes for color.  I also enjoyed the taste of them in it.  I used fresh basil from my garden.  This was not only a beautiful dish, it was a very tasty one as well.  I saw Hubby go back for thirds!  There are no leftovers.  Thank you Joey for sharing your recipe!  It's a KEEPER!

Agree with other reviewer saying spices were overpowering; and peppers were off sync too. Added butter, and salt to try to salvage, but in the end the flavors just didn't come together for me.

We love rice, and this one is very good. I used Arborio (Italian rice)  personal preference, and fresh basil  instead of the dried.  With this I made  mild Italian Sausage, next time I will double the recipe so I can have leftovers. Thank Joey Joan this is a keeper.

This was such a disappointment... Sorry...didn't like anything about it. The herbs were overpowering..I can't fathom where all the good reviews came from??  Grrr...and it's making me rate a star...  We should be allowed to pick no stars and even minus a few!!

I had a yellow pepper, not a red one, on hand and I wanted to use it. I used Penzey's "Pasta Sprinkle" in place of the dried basil & oregano (basically the same thing) and FORGOT about the Parmesan cheese! Still, we loved it! I'll make this again. Thank you.

This was a flop!  No one ate it.  My kids just ate the peppers.  I agree with the reviews that said the herbs overpowered the flavor, particularly the oregano.  If I were to try it, I would use fresh herbs, probably leave out the oregano.   I doubt I'll make it again though.

I replaced the red bell pepper with a second green bell pepper as opposed to red, largely because neither my husband nor I can taste the difference between the different color bell peppers. I would also recommend halving the amount of basil leaf in the recipe. Otherwise, it's a great throw-together side dish for any dinner.

Pretty good stuff - I used chives instead of onion and I used only 1/4 of a bell pepper. I felt 2 entire bell peppers would have been over powering. I also omitted dried herbs it seemed like too much at 1 teaspoon each and swapped for fresh parsley. I wanted the flavor  to be subtle.   Glad I made these tiny changes because it was delicious. Thank you for the inspiration.

I took the advice of others and omitted the basil and oregano. It served as a nice base dish to add chicken to! My family loved it and we happily devoured it, but I'm only giving it four stars due to the spice problem.

Really good. I used one cup of low sodium chicken broth in place of one cup water in the rice.  Didn't need the salt and I didn't have any wine.

All ingredients are off sync.  We didn't think the spices were overpowering.  We thought it was blend and filled with sutble weird flavors that don't really go together.
