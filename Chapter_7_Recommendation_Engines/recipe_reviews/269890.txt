Wow.  I just finished making these and thought they were just WONDERFUL.  I didn't use cauliflower or asparagus (didn't have), and added red onion chunks.  Actually I bought the veggies already skewered, and added 1-inch Korean style meatballs (fully cooked).  Also added a little balsamic vinegar to the oil.  Taste was out of this world.  May try smoked sausage with the veggies next time.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!!

On my journey to vegetarian and losing 30 lbs I needed a healthier snack this was a great way to eat smarter. New to air frying the spice and oil ratios were very helpful, though I used ghost pepper salt with whatever veggies I had in the fridge. Carrots Brussel sprouts chili peppers broccoli all great cucumbers not so much oh well I had to try.

I omitted the mushrooms and used my rotisserie basket. Kept everything the same. My husband loved this and it had a couple veggies he didn't think he would like.

I increased the air fryer time to about 12-13 minutes.
