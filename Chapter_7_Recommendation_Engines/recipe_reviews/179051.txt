We were very disappointed with this recipe, given the name Firecracker I expected it to have more zip to it.  We found the flavor to be rather bland and I had marinated the flank steak all day, used a hot salsa (personal preference), and followed the recipe exactly.  I won't be making this again.

It was ok...not spicy enough for us.  If we make it again we will add more spices.

I really like the salsa component this recipe added. We didn't have a Pace salsa, but we did have Mrs. Renfro's ghost chili salsa :). (My husband loves spice!) That provided a real nice, subtle heat to the marinade/sauce. 

My two-lb. flank steak took much longer to cook than I excpected. This is probably because my husband likes his well-done and I'm pregnant and can't have anything but well-done. 

Other than that, it came out nice and juicy with full flavor!
