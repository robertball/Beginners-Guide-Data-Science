This was great, I've made it twice already and am craving it again.  I wasn't sure how much to use so if you have that same question, here's what worked for me.  I cooked a 2 1/2 pound pork loin (tenderloin wasn't as good) cut in half in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low (just pour a beer over it, season it with salt and pepper and throw in some garlic cloves).  Then I shredded it using two forks and put it back in the crock pot and added this sauce in the "16 serving" size (1/2 cup of each vinegar).  I like it extra spicy, so I added more cayenne pepper and also some habanero hot sauce (1T-ish).  Just heat it through for 15 minutes and it's DELICIOUS.  Extra-good with fresh sliced onions and cole slaw on them.  Made enough for 16 well-stacked sandwiches.  I'm making this for the next family get together.

I FIND IT REALLY HARD TO PASS UP RATING A SAUCE THATS TITLE CAROLINA BBQ SAUCE, LET ME SAY AGAIN AS A EAST CAROLINA GIRL THIS IS THE TRUE EASTERN CAROLINA WAY. VINEGAR VINGAR VINEGAR, THATS THE KEY, ALSO THIS VERSION  YOU DO NOT COOK. WHICH IS MOSTLY HOW I USE IT, IT IS BEST ON PORK BUT CHICKEN RULES ALSO, USE IT THROUGH OUT THE GRILLING PROCESS. IF USED ONLY ON COOKED MEAT IT WILL BE OVER POWERING. ALSO I ALWAYS USE RED PEPPER FLAKES.

This is what makes North Cack bbq the best in the country.  I was born and raised in Greensboro, NC and have been eating both "Lexington Style" and "Eastern Style" Que all my life.  This recipe gets it about as right as I have seen for Eastern NC style.  The only suggestion to make it even more "Carolina" authentic is to substitute the Tabasco with Texas Pete.  Texas Pete has a little bit different flavor than Tabasco and you will never walk into a "real" North Carolina BBQ spot without seeing a bottle of Texas Pete on all the tables.

Wow.  This is great stuff!  We moved to NC about a year ago and wherever I can try pulled pork with this type of BBQ sauce, I do.  Never had it before moving here!! I followed a recipe on RecipeZaar (at least the cooking part) for a Carolina Style Pulled Pork Sandwich but I used Szeged "World's Best" Rib Rub (it is in a can, usually in the 'import' section of your grocery store) rather than making my own.  Sprinkled that on the pork butt, wrapped it several times over in plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge for 12 hours prior to cooking.  Plopped it in the crock pot, put 1/2 of this sauce in there and set it to cook for the day.  Shredded the meat, added some more sauce, put it on a roll with some coleslaw spooned on top and viola... a sandwich to rival local restaurants... and most importantly, my kids loved it.... ESPECIALLY the sauce!!

Being Tarheel born and Tarheel bred, if this recipe got any more "eastern Carolina" we'd be getting our feet wet! I do pulled pork often and this sauce is its crowning glory! Many, Many thanks for a taste of home!!

This is a great recipe for Carolina BBQ.  If you are unfamiliar with this style of BBQ you may not like it.  I slow cooked a 7 pound pork butt for about 17 hours on my Kamado BBQ, shredded it and put it in a crock-pot with all of the sauce.  I served it with Angie's Dad's Best Cabbage Coleslaw recipe with the pork on a hamburger bun.  So good!

Growing up in NC, I've eaten a lot of NC BBQ but I've never made it myself. All I could taste was vinegar. What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I was hoping for something like Smithfield's BBQ but this was sour and overpowering.

FABULOUS! It's tongue and lip smacking GOOD! Makes me wish I was born and raised in NC. 

I've made this recipe twice already and used it for more than just pulled pork. It's been wonderful each time. This recipe/sauce will be a staple in my house from now on.

My word of caution, being from NC, having lived in Eastern part of state for years and years, where I did undergrad and grad work, ate pulled pork in homes, backyards, bbq shacks--the best--restaurants down around Wilson, Kenley, Selma, Goldsboro to parts more hither--this is more of a mopping sauce, which--cut some of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar say 1/4 cup vinegar to apple juice and I get more authentic mop. The sauce itself is vinegary yes, but that which you might want to put on pork, add some brown sugar about a cup or UNTIL IT TASTES GOOD TO YOU. Yeah, you can ratchet down heat, but then it won't be Eastern NC sauce. To balance heat can add more brown sugar. But again, I see this more as a mop and less as a Eastern NC finishing sauce. "I am from Western NC and DO NOT LIKE tomato based sauces." Repeat, rinse. Do love some SC mustard/molasses sauces, which with cider vinegar, and brown sugar, makes a great finishing sauce for pulled pork. I know we say "save mustard for yer dawgs and ketchup for yer burger" but I've SEEN the Eastern NC cheat!

Not quite like home, but close.  The second time around I added another tbsp of sugar, a few shakes of worchestershire, some garlic salt & cut the cider vinegar in half.  As close as I've come to SC&B...for all you NC natives.

not bad but, You should use red pepper flakes, and not cayenne pepper. Also cut it down to 1 teaspoon for mild, 1 tablespoon for spicy. Also you do not need to let this set for 1 or 2 days, simply put it in the microwave for 2 mins this will help the pepper flakes to combine with the vinegar.

I used to work in a very successful BB-Q house in eastern NC, and the only thing that your recipe is missing is the juice of one lemon. This recipe rocks!

It was very good for my 1st time making NC BBQ. I'm from MA living in NC right now. I make it very different usually. I'm preferring vinegar these days. I don't have cayenne in the house so I used chili powder. Still yummy.

You want to make this receipe a whole lot better. Use Texas Pete. Add 1 cup of water. Put in a sauce or boiler pot and bring to a boil and cover. Let it simmer for at least 20 minutes, tightly covered.  I perfer using red pepper mixed and crushed well to almost a powder in a mortar/pestle.  This sauce is have more flavor as the ingredients are now cooked together.  It is much better when using on pit cooked hog.  I usually make it by the gallon and use while cooking. 7 hours down and then 1 hour up and make sure you don't stick the hog. This allows the juices to run off which isn't good. Then use this sauce to flavor if you are cutting it up. Best sauce made.  I also make it with ketchup if having a bunch in from TEXAS. Try my receipe and you will find it makes it much better.

I'm from california and I just got back from North Carolina and fell in love with the BBQ flavors in there sauce. I had to try to make it. I found this recipe and fell in love all over again. This is the best! Soaks right into the meat and the bun of a pulled pork sandwich. I'll never use anything else but this recipe! Enjoy it, I did!!!

Just how I remember it when visiting Granny and Family. Add hot pepper flakes. Complete with  coleslaw on top and put on a hamburger bun.  There is noting like NC BBQ.  Any body know of a good cheese biscuit recipe?

I have been craving BBQ from Moore's BBQ in New Bern, NC for a few years now. Since I am on the other side of the country, I have to make the BBQ and the sauce myself and I have to tell you, this is the best Eastern NC bbq sauce recipe I have found and it reminds me of the taste of the sauce used at Moore's. My husband even loves it and he's not even from the south.

This was pretty good. My mom was from North Carolina and the pulled pork BBQ sauce I've had, was a bit more sweet then this recipe. I added more brown sugar and cut down on the cayenne. The mix should be a combo of tangy and sweet, not so much hot as this recipe asks for.

I've only had Eastern Carolina sauce a few times, so I can't say for sure how accurate this is. But I can tell you it's a very tasty BBQ sauce option. I made it a tad spicier and sweeter than called for and I simmered it on the stove for a little while to help the flavors meld faster. It's definitely a keeper.

Sorry, I was hoping this would really be a hit.  It was too vinegary (even though eastern NC style sauce IS vinegary).  It lacked something, I wouldn't make this again.

Excellent! Lived in N.C. as a child and this is the way I remember the BBQ. I used Texas Pete as the hot sauce and used a tablespoon of crushed Red Pepper to replace the cayenne. It tastes great either way. An excellent recipe to start with.

I used red pepper flakes instead of ground cayenne pepper - I have a bottle of this in my fridge at all times!

Use a little of this, a pork butt and a crock pot - cook until it pulls apart with w forks ('pulled pork'), drain the juice. Serve on a hamburger bunn with more sauce and really good coleslaw!

I will admit that I had never actually had real barbeque unil I moved to Durham, NC for college. Since then I have become an addicted to real barbeque and have eaten at restaurants all around the country. I was skeptical about this recipe at first, but after trying it. I realized that this is a really good recipe, I have used this as a basis to develop my own sauce, but it does represent true NC flavor.

PERFECT!!! My father in law is from Albemarle, NC and he has always raved about the bbq. I made this sauce for him and he said it is exactly like what he used to get in the Eastern carolina bbq joints.  Me being from southern Colorado and used to the sloppy sticky sweet sometimes spicy red sauce, I had no idea what the difference was. I made this recipe along with a slow roasted pork butt recipe from one of my favorite food network stars Anne Burell. I am now an EASTERN Norh Carolina BBQ lover and I will NEVER go back!!!

I've never had anything like this, and I was eager to make it.  It's good.  I'm taking it to a pig roast tomorrow.  I did add my own touches - just a touch more sugar, and a little allspice, which I love with pork. (I'm sure some will cry foul, but honestly food is about what you love, not how someone says it has to be.)  :-D

I did this recipe exactly the way it said to.  The sauce tasted like straight up vinegar and no spices...I'm not sure what went wrong but the only reason I gave it a star was becuase i had to!

This is all about the vinegar and as any true Carolina pulled pork sandwich lover, thats the key to a great sandwich!  I substituted a combination of red wine and malt vinegar for the cider vinegar and it tasted great.  I also added more Tabasco to ratchet up the spice.

I lived in East Carolina for over 40 yrs and my son was raised there. This is as close as you can get to the Real Deal ! We made for the family and they all (but one spoil sport) loved it. We did substitute the cayenne for crush red pepper and Texas Pete for the Tabasco, trying to keep it as close to what you'd find on any East Carolina restaurant table. The sauce was made a day in advance, which I would now do two, and we served the BBQ the next day, which I will now let rest at least over night. It was Much better the next day, as leftovers.(and even better two days after that)

Yup, this is how we make our sauce here in eastern NC. I do add crushed red pepper and a little more Texas Pete to mine. You can pour it by the gallon on a whole hog, or you can use it to prepare NC-style BBQ in your slow cooker. It's also good over grilled chicken, which is what we had for a 4th of July lunch. Thanks for sharing our eastern NC way of making BBQ sauce with all of the Allrecipeeps. :)

I moved from Eastern NC to Seattle 5 years ago.  I've been searching for a proper BBQ sauce for all 5 of those years, and now I've finally found it.  It's just like the stuff I used to get back home.

This was easy to make. I didnt put the brown sugar in mine because I dont like the sweet taste in my food.  I did however use Lawrys seasoning salt instead of regular salt and added garlic powder. Wow.

Easy to make and goes perfectly with my pork shoulder which has spent the last 8 hours in my crockpot with a can of coke (super easy).  The vinegar melts with the pork fat and the spice kick is perfect.  Going back for seconds now.

I smoked a couple of 8lb butts and made this sauce and 2 others.  I let everyone choose the type of sauce they wanted.  As fate would have it, one of the people that we had over is from NC.  She said this is just like she remembers her grandfather making!!  Where we live, most people slather on the thick, sweet, tomato-based sauces. It was good to taste pork with the tang of vinegar, they go well together.

I lived in North Carolina for 17 years and this sauce is the closest sauce that I have ever tasted used at a pig-picking or purchasing from one of the many BBQ restraunts I have eaten at.  We moved to Maine 2 years ago (2006) and my daughter requested a southern BBQ meal for her birthday, so we made pulled pork BBQ with this recipe, hush puppies, KFC Mac & Cheese, KFC Cole Slaw, and Baked Beans. Of course we had to have SWEET TEA too.  It was fun and we are going to add the pulled pork with this sauce to our menu every week.  Once you try it you will understand!

My husband spent a good deal of his childhood years living in Elizabeth City, NC.  I made this sauce especially for him.  He can't get enough of it.  I like it too, however, I still prefer my sweet, saucy VA style bbq.  It'll definately be delicious with some good cole slaw on it.  I recommend restaurant- style coleslaw 1 from this site. :-)

This is it!!!  I lived in ENC for over 16 years and grew to love this BBQ sauce.  My son found this recipe and referred me to it.  It is the real thing or as close as you can get.  I have enjoyed making it a few times now and always swear I hear the ocean roaring as I'm eating it!!!

This is a very authentic Eastern Carolina-style sauce.  It's spicy and great on pulled pork.  I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, and a little dried thyme, but other than that, it's perfect.

I found that this recipe gave me a decent baseline for understanding HOW to make a Carolina BBQ (I'm a New Englander), but I definitely had to make some adjustments. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very thin and watery, and the vinegar flavor was totally overpowering. So I tried making it a second time, and what I did to combat these issues was actually pretty simple: I cut the amount of vinegar in half, and added some blackstrap molasses to balance out the flavor and add some more body. The result was absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend trying it that way. Although I am from up North, I have had the authentic Carolina BBQ sauce before, and I don't think that my adjustments hurt the integrity at all, or at least it didn't alter the makeup enough to render it unrecognizable as a Carolina BBQ. If the way I ended up doing it was how it was initially written up, I would have given this recipe a sure-fire five stars.

I'm a native NCian. I prefer fancier vinegars to the white + cider vinegar. Fruit-infused ones are really great, especially something complementary to pork like a fig vinegar.

I don't care for BBQ sauce, but when I mix this sauce w/ a little BBQ sauce, I can tolerate it a lot better.  By itself - it can be a little strong (for me), but still a great recipe.

I have searched for a recipe like this for 22 years.  Ever since I had this style BBQ in Goldsboro, NC.  I was a huge success.  Even people that don't like spicy stuff loved it.

A little undecided on this one. I think the flavor was nice, but our chicken that we cooked on the grill came out very very dry. I'm giving this recipe three stars because we are all novices at grilling here, so it could have been how we cooked it. Also, barbecue (low & slow) is traditionally different than grilling (fast and hight) so that could have made a difference. I'm going to try this again in the slow cooker and see if that makes a difference

With BBQ sauce, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there is no one right sauce. So, I give this one 5-stars, but have my comments. Note that my favorite sauces are vinegar or vinegar/ketchup based. -vinegar overpowers, I would reduce vinegar and especially reduce the white vinegar -spices do not "dissolve," too much sediment. Cooking it would probably help or straining after sitting a few days - need to shake it frequently -needs a touch more sweetness - more sugar, molasses or honey -be careful with what hot sauce you use, they don't all taste he same. I used Texas Pete and it tainted the flavor of the sauce in a negative way - I'll skip the hot sauce next time and use more cayenne or red pepper flakes

I've never been much for the vinegar base BBQ cause I'm from the north and would prefer regular BBQ sauce, but this was very good and I would make it again. Just a note: I did add a touch of red pepper flakes for a bit more punch.

Not sure how to rate this. the sauce taste great and loved it. would give it 5 stars. However I couldnt figure out how to cook with it. not really a sauce where you can apply it to anything. but was more of a liquid. I decided top crockpot a beef roast and make a pull pork sandwiches out of it. it was very good but becuase of the liquid added by the cooking of meat it lost some of it punch but was very good.

I tried to think of a way to thicken it. thought abotuu adding ketchup, tomato paste and mustard. but then it would lost the nc BBQ sauce label. So I give the recipe 4 stars.

The real deal.  For the past 3 years, this has been my "GO TO" recpipe for ENCBBQ.  Not only is it OUTSTANDING IMO, many locals have endorsed it as the closest they've had to the real thing.  If you are looking for true ENC style BBQ, look no further.  BTW, I've tried other recipes, with taste tests, and according to those "in the know", this is the clear winner!  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!

I am not from NC (born in PA) so this kind of BBQ sauce is not what I am used to.  My fiance grew up in VA and his mom's family is from NC so I thought I would try it for him.  Well, he like it and I didn't so I met in the middle with 3 stars.

I'm from NC and was in the military for 28 years so this taste of home was always something we had to have when we came home to visit family. My wife and I both love our Eastern NC BBQ! This is probably the closest thing to what we are used to. I did make a couple of changes. I use crushed pepper flakes and definitely Texas Pete. Other than those two things, it's perfect! To all those saying it's too vinegary, that's kind of the point. Thanks for the great recipe! I've made it lots of times and can't imagine my pulled pork without it.

I was born and raised in Lynchburg Virginia and this is what you will find at any place that sells pulled pork. (I've also probably been to every city in NC too) The only thing I've noticed different is the ratio of vinegar. It needed a extra tablespoon of brown sugar. You need just a touch of sweet and with one teaspoon it didn't cut it. I would also adjust your Texas Pete (don't use  tabasco sauce) and cayenne pepper to taste. For me needed that little extra kick..... Did I say do not use Tabasco sauce?, well don't. Southerners use Texas Pete, there is a HUGE difference in taste.

We went to the Old Salem Tavern and had these wonderful sweet potato fries with BBQ on the top sprinkled with white cheddar and this sauce reminds me of that flavorful experience.  You nailed it!

Good flavor, but I prefer the sauce with the pepper flakes in it as opposed to the ground pepper.  The ground pepper seems to make it hotter than the flakes do.

Definitely a good sauce!  It was a little peppery for my husband but not nearly as much bite once it was on the meat than by itself.  I ended up cooking it on the stove since I didnt have a few days to wait for the flavors to blend.

I thought this sauce was very good, but a little to tangy for me. Next time, I will use the full amount of cider vinegar and leave out the white vinegar for a more mellow flavor. I also reduced the cayenne pepper and added red pepper flakes since I saw that in so many other NC BBQ sauce recipes on this site. I did enjoy this sauce and I will try it again when we make pulled pork in the slow cooker so it will have time to mellow out while cooking.

I'm from Texas originally but wanted something different for pulled pork. I mixed this up in bottle so everyone could just squirt some on their pulled pork. It was very good! The only thing I did differently was to use all apple cider vinegar and throw in some red pepper flakes. My husband loves vinegar and he was in Heaven.

I had trouble rating this recipe. I've never had authentic N.C. BBQ before so I can't judge it against that. My boyfriend and I both love spice and vinegar so I thought this would be an instant hit. We both initially thought it was missing some body and thickness. I took about half the sauce and added a tbsp or so of Dijon mustard to it and mixed it up well. To me, that made it perfect. I got the spice and vinegar plus a consistency I liked. After 2 or 3 ribs, the boyfriend decided he liked the authenic version. So I'm meeting him in the middle and giving this recipe 4 stars. Maybe someday I'll make it to a pig pickin' and see if N.C. vinegar sauce is just not to my taste. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this to use with Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork. It was very flavorful, but very spicy. I made it 2 days ahead of time so that the flavors could mingle. I added it to the meat after it was shredded and let it simmer for a couple of hours. I might try halving the cayenne pepper and Tabasco next time.

Finally a darn-near perfect recipe for Eastern NC barbecue sauce! I'm a born-and-bred Eastern NC girl, and this tastes like home. I love the heat, this is great, just like a real pig-pickin', not that weak stuff you find in restaurants.

I had to make significant modifications to eat this. First, I strained out most of the pepper after the first twelve hours. I had used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne, so that was convenient. I Added three more Tablespoons of brown sugar. Added some celery seed, Worcestershire and a splash of lemon juice, a bit of agave, garlic powder... clearly, my concoction no longer bears resemblance to the original recipe, but it is much better.

I've had BBQ pulled pork at Wilbur's in Goldsboro many times and had his sauce shipped to me by the case. This recipe is exactly what they're famous for. I grew up with it, and can't get enough.

Tangy, spicy, and just a hint of sweet. Perfect as both a basting sauce and a finishing or dipping sauce for pork and poultry.

Really good. A bit hot for me, I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and better. Also used Siracha instead of Tabasco.

No red pepper flakes, so used chipotle powder.  Replaced the brown sugar with a scoop of stevia.  I could literally DRINK this manna in a bottle!  It has been used on tacos, spiced up a pot of ham and beans, and poured on to a waffle sammich (don't ask.  We're a weird bunch).  I will commit the recipe to memory and make this a million times. Delicious

Measured everything exactly, was to HOT. I should have cut the Cayenne pepper to 1 Teaspoon, and the hot sauce to 1 teaspoon as well. 
I've added ¾ cup apple juice and 2 table spoons of honey to try and tone down, but seems way to hot still.

No self respecting Eastern NC BBQ Sauce has any sugar of any kind in it. I grew up on Eastern NC BBQ Sauce and I never seen a good one without crushed rep pepper! The best ones are all cider vinegar and are cooked!!!

Just like I remembered.  Four stars because I had to substitute the hot sauce so mine wasn't an exact replica.  I couldn't find my Texas Pete's hot sauce (!) so I used a tiny amount of sriracha instead.  Still has that kick without being too hot.

I used this not as a sauce, but as the cooking liquid.  I was cooking two racks of ribs low and slow on my egg and put a pork loin on since I had room. Obviously the ribs would be done first so I then put the loin in a 4 qt slow cooker, ( over a small bed of celery and onions) and added this recipe as written. Cooked on low for several hours, then pulled the pork and put it back in the cooker. The pork promptly absorbed the sauce - and I promptly absorbed the pork!  Fantastic flavor. Some heat, some tang, well balanced.  (Honestly I didn't wait to add a slaw or a bun or any sauce!). Great stuff!

An eatery near me (Oregon) offers this for sale but charges too much.  The 'heat' factor is just right for me, but as other note, it was too thin.  I heated it gently and added a little corn starch slurry.  Perfect IMO.  FYI,  I cooked about half a pork butt in a pressure cooker (about one hour at 15 psi ) with generally Mexican seasonings,  cooled enough to pull the meat and served on buns or - your choice.   This now my Go-To BBQ sauce and so much better than the heavy, sweet ones.  Love the stuff and yes, the 'heat' facto can be adjusted.   The vinegar gives a little pucker.  Next time I'll make a double batch.

Ok, so you nailed it! I am a lifelong North Carolina girl & this is spot on! It does have a strong vinegar taste  (which is what I am accustomed to) but the pepper & brown sugar mellow it out. Personally,  I don't think it's too hot, too sweet, or too vinegary but a great balance. I have previously been buying bottles of this type of sauce from a long time BB-Q restaurant in China Grove but I will be making my own from here on! It is very close if not slightly better ;-) Thanks so much for sharing!

I moved back to Texas after living in Raleigh and missed the vinegar based bbq for pulled pork.  I love this recipe, I never make it ahead of time so I just mix it, heat it to simmer, shut it off and let it cool to combine the flavors.  Delicious!

Based on the great reviews, I made a batch a few days ago to go with the pork butt I smoked. The taste was good, but unlike the sauces I'm used to, this has the consistency of water. I hope I don't ruin the flavor, but I'm planning to thicken it by adding some catsup, just as soon as there is enough room in the container.

Delicious!!! Just what I have been looking for…reminds me of growing up going to "pig pickin's" while living in Goldsboro, NC. I now live in Alabama and I made this sauce for a church cookout…it was gone in minutes! It's a little on the spicy side, which is fine with me. I added a little bit more brown sugar for a sweeter taste. Already have people requesting me to make them a batch!

The Best! Also, mixed In little corn starch and used it to finish ribs on the grill. I also made a batch and added Dijon mustard to it. Highly recommend if the vinegar is too over powering.

First time with NC BBQ pork shoulder.  Specifically East North Carolina BBQ.  I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, Old Bay and used a little mesquite smoke on the Weber for 6 hours.  I couldn't find the cayenne pepper in my pantry so I used Emeril's essence and it was still plenty spicy.  After I tasted it, I thought it should be sweeter so I added another tablespoon and a half of brown sugar.  I poured half the sauce over the 5 pounds of pulled meat.  It didn't need any more than that. I'm from Chicago, lived in Texas and had a lot of bbq.  I was impressed with the simplicity and flavor.  I'm definitely doing this again.

Excellent! The whole family gobbled it up. I added 2 tsp. of the cayenne pepper and of the Tabasco sauce instead of the Tbsp. We live in Ecuador and were missing Carolina BBQ. So glad to find this recipe.

I've tried many BBQ sause recipes and this one is by far the best, however I added shaved orange peelings to it and a couple of orange slices and it's fantastic!

I followed recipe to the exact amounts and the vinegar was a bit over powering. I would def. make again, I would just cut back on the vinegar.

I used this recipe for drum sticks on the grill.  The sauce definately kept the chicken very moist, but I didnt feel like it gave it a ton of flavor.  It was not even that spicy.  Maybe it just was not ment to be put on drumsticks.

Huge Hit at the party I had!  I made kabobs with New York Strips and this was the maranaide.  Delicious!  I gave the recipe to 3 people before they left. I think I will have to make it again tonight.

This is authentic, but spicier than the restaurants  I've visited.  Perhaps I always got the "mild" version.
