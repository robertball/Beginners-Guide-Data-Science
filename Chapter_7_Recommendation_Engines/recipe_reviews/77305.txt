I scaled this recipe for 1 serving and have to say I was skeptical of it being chocolaty enough for my tastes but boy was I wrong, this turned out to be rich, chocolaty and sweet, just the way I like it! I used vanilla extract and some fresh whipped cream on top to treat myself. Delicious! Will make this again very soon!
