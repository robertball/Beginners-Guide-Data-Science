I am the submitter of this recipe and I thought I'd add a note now that it's been published!  It took making lots of coffee cakes and muffins over many years to know what I like in a recipe for them - namely, butter, buttermilk (or sour cream), a little cinnamon and a perfect crumb topping. Tossing in a little fruit that you want to use before it goes to waste doesn't hurt either! If you don't like nutmeg, leave it out. Or substitute with cinnamon or lemon zest. Don't want a coffee cake? This is easily converted to muffins. Today I sprinkled some powdered sugar over the cooled cake (still using the crumb topping), but just a simple glaze of powdered sugar and a little milk, drizzled over the crumb topping after it's cooled is pretty too, and adds just a little more sweetness.  Also, fresh or frozen berries may be used!

Delicious crumb cake! I was eyeing up this recipe for a while and since I had some buttermilk on hand that I wanted to use up it was time to give it a try. I didn't add any of the fruit as I wanted a classic crumb cake and boy did I find one! Just as the submitter states, it's just as delicous without the fruit. The crumb topping is wonderful and next time I'll double it, because it was so good.  The cake itself was moist, slightly sweet, and nicely spiced. I topped it with a nice dose of powdered sugar and it was perfect with a cup of tea or coffee. I can't wait to try this again with a variety of fruits such as apple or blueberry and maybe throw in some nuts like walnuts or pecans....

This is THE perfect crumb cake. Some can be dry or have a topping that just isn't right. This is moist, buttery delicious and the crumb topping is excellent. The buttermilk makes this especially moist and tasty, I think, and the slight hint of nutmeg adds another dimension of flavor. While I can see making this with lots of different fruits as possibilities, or even plain for that matter, I liked the combination of raspberries and mango. Thanks for the great recipe Naples34102

This recipe is a delightful change from the normal sugary, super sweet cakes, cookies, etc...not that I don't appreciate those as well! I personally did not care for the fresh mango chunks as they got watered down and lost, well, all of their flavor, but I could tell from the blueberries that more substantial fruits are key and will use blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, etc, in the future. I took the finished product to a meeting a few nights ago and everyone raved and are *still* talking about it--esp. the men (go figure...*smile*). The most over-the-top, decadent goodness in this recipe is the crumb topping. It's so divine that I decided to make "Banana Chip Muffins I" from this site today and and while several reviewers stated they added cinnamon to the batter, I just couldn't see that in my mind's eye with everything already going on ingredient-wise. Then, I had an "ah-ha" moment--incorporate some cinnamon by adding THIS crumb topping! The topping completely salvaged an otherwise ho-hum recipe. I have a little left over that I think will even be good on vanilla ice cream. Kudos to the submitter for a most definite make again recipe many times over!

AWESOME!  So moist and delicious.  I love the fact that different fruits can be used.  I used a fresh peach and a cup of frozen raspberries.  I can't wait to try others.  The topping was incredible!  It made the whole cake just perfect.  Thank you Naples for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!  UPDATE:  I just made this recipe again but this time as muffins.  I divided the batter into four bowls.  One bowl had the addition of blueberries, another had raspberries, another I added cranberries and apples were added to the last.  I now have a variety of muffins not to mention that some muffins will be a surprise combination.  The only problem I see is I want to try them all!  They took a little less time to bake so just keep your eye on them until a toothpick comes out clean.  Also, no need to double the topping.  I did and it wasn't necessary.  Thanks again Naples!!

This is definitely a five-star recipe!  I hesitated because I am not totally enamored of mango, but my Recipe Exchange friends told me this would be a good way to give it a second chance.  I followed the recipe exactly, christening my new springform pan!  By the way, a cup of raspberries is about a  6-oz container.    I wish you could have seen my seven-year-old granddaughter bite into this yummy cake!  She closed her eyes, rolled her bite around as if she had tasted a little bite of heaven, and begged for more.  Need I ever say anything more??   UPDATE 8/21/10  This freezes very well.  I just took out the half I saved wrapped in foil and then freezer-bagged, and when I heated it in the microwave, my hubby kept saying, "Mmmmm!"

FABULOUS! As quoted by my boyfriend: this is probably the best coffee cake I've made yet. And I bake A LOT. I am SO pleased with how this turned out. I loved the texture and flavors...mango and blueberries go together very nicely in this recipe. I used the optional nutmeg (freshly grated, which makes a difference!). I added a little drizzle of cream cheese frosting to the top (it didn't stay on very well because it's a crumb-y topping, but whatev) and it was a nice addition. Can't wait to make again with all sorts of flavor variations!

This was a wonderful cake! I only had blueberries, so I went with those and the mango, of course, but can't wait to try it with other fruits too. I love a nice, thick crumb topping and this was just perfect! I thought I had an 9" square pan, but it was only an 8", so I used my 9" round pan and that worked out just fine. I will most definately be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

I tried these as muffins using powdered buttermilk, a peach and blueberries in place of mango and raspberries.{Submitter suggests all but the powder buttermilk as possible variations}. I look forward to doing these sometime when I have the pans and all the listed ingredients, but even with my substitutions they were tasty. I do wonder if a hotter oven (400 F. perhaps) for 20 to 25 minutes would work if doing muffins. I made two dozen small muffins and cooked at 350 for about thirty minutes.

I wish I could say I loved this but it was just wrong for me in so many ways. I found out I hate baked mango- the taste texture and color were all unappetizing. As others have mentioned the cake around the fruit was gummy as well. I also did not care for the grit of raspberry seeds in the cake. The cake was fairly bland and too fluffy- every piece served fell to the side. I prefer a coffee cake with more "body" to it. And lastly- I really missed the traditional buttery streusel. This was tasteless and the dry sand texture was not what I want in a crumb cake. I would try it with different fruit, some more vanilla or rum extract and a traditional crumb topping but then I guess it would be a whole different recipe. No one cared for this.

Absolutely perfect in every way. I used fresh blackberries and a small handful of fresh raspberries and baked in a 9" springform and everyone loves it. The texture, sweetness level, amount of fruit and topping, ... everything is exactly what I have been looking for and finally found it. Can't wait to make it with other fruits.
Made a conf sugar and lemon juice glaze to drizzle, for those who wanted it. This cake is amazing with or without it.  I know this one will be requested often. Thanks for sharing!

This is the BEST coffee cake. My office is still raving about it. It's light and moist and the crumb topping is perfect.   This recipe was a great find and I'll certainly be making it again. I didn't use the mango, but an assortment of berries worked very well.

Here was the challenge...could a novice baker (such as me) make this cake with results as good as his wife’s (the submitter, Naples34102)?  I admit I did need a moderate amount of supervision and guidance.  I didn’t know, for instance, to mix the crumble topping with a fork! And there were a couple of other missteps as well; the mango wasn’t ripe enough and I mistakenly brought heavy cream home from the store, not buttermilk.  But not a problem because Naples always has frozen berries on hand (I used raspberries and blueberries) and she introduced me to buttermilk powder.  I found her recipe directions easy to follow (for a novice like myself) and the cake a breeze to mix up.  I’m not generally a fan of coffeecakes or muffins, but I sure do like this one.  I’ll be bringing it into the office and I can’t wait to hear my staff’s reaction when I tell them this time this was my contribution, not my wife’s!

This lasted..less than 48 hours. It was that amazing. I didn't even make the crumb topping, but rather sprinkled Sugar in the Raw on top. Used milk an vinegar vs. buttermilk an subbed in blueberries. Everything followed exact an, as previously stated, it dissapeared. Madre is already asking for me to make it again!! Loved the top crunch an, an, ooo I'll be making again. Thanks for your loving recipe, it's spot on spectacular.

Absolutely delish! Moist, perfectly sweet without being too much so. The topping is spot on. Just LOVE it! I only used mango in mine this time around. I'd love to have it plain-the cake is just THAT good!!

I'm Naples' daughter and it's about time I tried my mom's recipe!  Maybe I'm a little biased but this was excellent, just as I knew it would be, having grown up with the benefit of all her awesome cooking and baking! Nice and moist, fruity and flavorful, with a delicious crumb topping that's just a little different than most. I'm not as experienced as Mom is, of course, but her recipe is easy to follow and turns out a great finished product!

I made this with my 10 year old daughter. It was easy for her to follow the well written directions pretty much by herself with minimal help. We didn't have fresh mango so we used fresh blueberries instead and the cake turned out wonderful. The topping is incredible and just makes the cake. My daughter saved the last few pieces for her grandparents and days later it was still moist and delicious!

This is a very nice coffee cake recipe. But then, it's hard to reinvent coffee cake as the recipe, and slight variations of it, have been around since time began. Although, I did enjoy the unusual addition of mango in combination with the raspberries. I have always used buttermilk in baking - it makes a world of difference. So I was glad to see this recipe utilizing it. Nothing needs changing here, and I would use this recipe again. *I am updating my rating as I recently noticed when looking for a recipe through my reviews, that I mistakenly gave this a 4 rating when I do believe I meant to give it a 5. This recipe did not need any adjustments so I shouldn't have given a 4. I admit I'm an old lady so that will be my sorry excuse.

Oh Yum! Thank you naples for an excellent recipe! I took a chance on an unknown recipe and made two of them. I served them at a family birthday brunch and they were loved by all. Even the two youngest grandchildren that are usually into frosting and sprinkles skipped the birthday cake and went for yours after a small taste. The directions were exact and well written. I saw no reason to deviate from them or the ingredients. The cake was moist and delicious and the crumb topping was the best I've ever had. The combination of mango and raspberry was excellent although I can't wait to experiment a little, perhaps all raspberry. Regardless how I make it, this recipe will be a welcome addition to the master cookbook. Readers you must try this one, you won't be sorry. Ignore the negative reviews about this being, bland, tastless and just plain ugly. So, not true! Thanks again!

This is a wonderful crumb cake - I used blueberries and mango, and the only change was to use 1/4 cup of egg white, only because I realized at the last minute I had used my last whole egg. I did need to bake a bit longer - probably closer to 50 minutes for the toothpick test to work out. The cake is so very moist and tender, and the crumb topping is perfect. I can't wait to try other fruit combinations! In fact, I can't wait to try it without fruit, too!

This wasn't very flavorful and wasn't too fluffy.  Kids and hubby found it bland.  Always read the positive AND negative reviews.

I made this with fresh blackberries and mango. The cake was crumbly and well, there's just no other way to say this, but ugly.  I waited for the cake to cool knowing that many baked goods present a more appetizing appearance once they've had a chance to set, this was not the case with this cake.  They say tasting is believing, but frankly, aside from the tasty bits of fresh fruit, the cake itself was overly sweet and kinda gummy where it came in contact with the fruit.  I tried the recipe a second time using a larger pan and dropping the fruit on top instead of folding it into the batter.  Didn't make a difference, this still had the consistency of a quickbread instead of a cake.  But then again, I've not had much success with quickie, one egg cake recipes.  I think the cake could be improved with the addition of an extra egg, sprinkling a second layer of crumbs in the middle of the batter and adding the fruit to the bottom of the pan, in the manner of a pineapple upside down cake.

I gave this recipe five hearty stars. I LOVED it. I had a few small changes just based on what I had in the house. I didn't use any berries because I didn't have any, but I'll bet they would have been awesome in the cake. I also used pumpkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg because that's what I had. I wanted to say thanks for adding the note to cream the butter and sugar until it was noticeably lighter. I've been baking for a long time and have never read that, and I think it made a huge difference in making a very fluffy cake. This recipe in fact made a very, very light, fluffy cake. Thank you!

Hmmmm... I did something wrong. I'm a novice cook. Mine didn't come out anything like the pictures and it was not near sweet enough. I think if I did this one again I would make it sweeter, for sure. I recommend more sugar.

We loved this!  I love that it's not too sweet, which makes me feel better about giving it too my kids.  I used mangoes and strawberries...fantastic.  The only thing is I used an 8x8 pan and it needed longer to bake.  Will definitely make again!

Very good!!!  I used mango and strawberries but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think I may have used a 8X8 pan by mistake and it caused me to have to lower the temp to 325 after the 50 minutes and bake an additional 15 minutes or so.  The topping is excellent!

Yum!  I see why the submitter says you can leave out the fruit or sub other kinds of fruit--the cake is really good, but I have to say that if you have raspberries and mango, go for it bc the combo in this is awesome.  The tartness of the raspberries keeps this from being too sweet, and the mango adds a counterweight to the raspberries.  With the mild, yet flavorful cake it's wonderful.  I misunderstood the directions for the topping (don't ask me why bc I've made thousands of these things so I must've been losing my mind) and and thought it was supposed to be wet like wet sand so I melted the butter.  No, not correct at all--the recipe clearly says softened butter NOT melted butter.  Sigh.  But for all of that, it still tastes wonderful, just the crumble is missing in mine.  I bet it would be even better than wonderful for people who can actually follow recipes to the letter (I really can't apparently!).  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

I've had my eye on this for awhile, and finally got around to making it tonight since I had some raspberries to use up. What a lovely cake! Nice and moist, and the sweetness was just right to stand on its own or accommodate the added sweetness of a glaze (which I added, and it was YUM). I'm not  a huge fan of the mango in the cake (and it might have been more helpful to specify an exact measurement of mango to use instead of just "one mango," since fruits can differ in size); everyone else loved it, so I think it's just a preference thing. I have some blueberries in the fridge, and am having to fight the urge to make a Buttermilk Blueberry Crumb Cake. :) Beautiful recipe.

I've been looking for a great crumb topping and this is the one.  I love the description of "wet sand" it really lets me know what I'm looking for.  Cake is great, have done all types of fruit and is also great plain.

This recipe may require less fruit.  I baked this a little longer to "fully" cook; the cake was gummy and the topping was not crumb like.  Baking is something I love to do but this just doesn't cut it as is.  My mango's may have been too juicy?

This was average. I did not like the combination of mango and rasberries in it. If I made it again I would leave it out or use blueberries.

Truely a perfect medley of ingredients. I added the optional nutmeg but other than that I didn't double guess the recipe as I sometimes do based on reviews, and was rewarded with a perfectly moist, heavenly cake.

This was a big hit.  I used some leftover frozen peaches and blueberries which was a nice flavor combination, and I look forward to making this again with raspberries.  A big square of this is impressive and looks like the expensive coffee cake at a coffee shop.  Because I bake at high altitude, I reduced the butter to 6.5 T. and the sugar to 7/8 c. in the batter, and it worked perfectly with a rich, buttery flavor.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than I  probably added more fruit than the recipe called for as I didn't measure it.  I made 4 mini loafs with this recipe and thought it was great.

this was awesome.  It was nice because some parts were simple enough for kids to help.  Make sure you get very ripe mangoes as the less ripe ones make it a bit sour, but we liked it that way.  Everyone loved it!

There were so many coffee cakes to choose from but I knew if I was making naples34102's recipe it would be a good choice.  Sure enough, this recipe lives up to all its great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly. I don't usually bake with buttermilk but I now have no doubt it's what makes the taste and texture of this cake so superior. I did use raspberries and mango but I can see where any number of options would be just as delicious, so definitely use what you like or have available.  The crumb topping is delicious too! With or without fruit, this will now be my go-to coffee cake recipe.

I wanted to use up some frozen raspberries and this was a perfect way to do so. I enjoyed  the crunch of the topping, and the crumb was dense, but not too heavy. I did think it was just a little too sweet (thus the 4 star) but the others that ate it didn't seem to. Thank you Naples34102, for a very nice cake recipe, that I will make again and try with different fruits.

Excellent recipe, I used no calorie sugar and fat free buttermilk, this might be a lower fat- lower calorie option for the cake and it still tastes excellent.
I only used mangos and it turned put great, I really recommend it.

I wanted to use up some buttermilk and mangos that I had. I usually make mango blueberry muffins from this site but wanted to try something different. Coincidently this recipe was one of the featured photos of the day. And it being Naples' recipe made it even more appealing. (I'm a huge fan of her reviews) Let me tell you, I'm sure happy I made this. It's fabulous. I used mangos and blueberries. For those that have a problem with the mango measurements being vague (i.e. 1 mango) the average mango yields about 1 cup of fruit after it is seeded and diced. My mangos were on the small side so I diced enough to fill one cup. As I was making the crumb topping I thought oh my gosh this is a LOT of topping but I trusted that Naples knew what she was doing. And it is a crumb cake after all. The amount of topping turned out to be just perfect.  I used a 9" springform pan and baked it for 10 minutes longer (reduced heat to 325 after 50 minutes). I tried a piece straight out of the oven because I couldn't wait and although it was delicious I knew it would be better a few hours after it cooled when the cake got a chance to set. And I was right. Don't know how I kept from eating the whole thing. I can't wait to eat it for breakfast tomorrow because I know it will be even better. Thank you Naples!

This was a delicious cake. I think I cooked it a little too long, so it was a liitle dry, but that was not the fault of the recipe. I will definitely make this again, and look for a not completely clean toothpick. Thanks!

I agree with Lilly. I also found this too sweet. Won't make this again. This recipes owner is very critical of other recipes. Think would have high standards when posting their own.

I am surprised I have not written a review before, I thought I had as this is my go-to recipe for crumb cake.  Moist, flavorful, good with any fruit and it has a nice presentation.  This has gone over well at church coffee hour and bake sales.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some of the buttermilk I have. After looking over many, this is the one that made my mouth water so I had to make it. And everything was in my fridge, freezer, pantry or fruit bowl. I used frozen  raspberries. This is crazy  good.
I'm taking the rest of it to my sisters house for cinco de mayo gathering. Thank you Naples.....for this recipe.

very moist and well balanced flavors. Easy to make and measurements precise. Had a fresh mango and lots of raspberries on hand. also used low-fat buttermilk since I had that on hand as well. Make sure you blend well, batter will be thick. crumb topping yummy and overall smells wonderful. delish and a keeper. thank you naples!!

I just want to say the crumb topping makes ALOT, so next time (as I used a round cake pan for lack of a square one) I will layer the topping and batter. The only changes was to use half butter and half unsweetened applesauce, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, milk + lemon juice for the buttermilk and strawberries instead of the raspberries. Made it for my son's birthday and the three of us enjoyed it.

I liked this, but it was quite 'wet' inside, although very done.  My mango was a bit dry, so I sprinkled it with a tsp. of sugar to make the juices come out - maybe that is what made the cake so wet?  Note that it wasn't easy to evenly distribute the crumb topping, but it spread all over during baking, so don't worry about 'blobbing' it on.  1/2 tsp. nutmeg seemed like a lot (that spice is strong!), but I added it anyway, and was glad I did!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great basic recipe for coffeecake.  We loved the consistancy and topping, but we found teh cake a bit bland.  Next time I will add a little more vanilla extract (maybe even some almond extract) and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  For the fruit, I used a blend of berries, but I found that raspberries tasted best.

We enjoyed this crumb cake. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper. I like to use over sized parchment so it hangs over the sides of the pan for easy lifting of the cake out of it. Used sour cream instead of buttermilk. This cake is delicious and moist even though I opted not to use fruit in it. Make this if you haven't Yum! Thank you for sharing naples34102

This is a moist and delicious cake! The only change I made to the recipe was substituting the nutmeg with cinnamon and the mango for more berries...I personally do not like the taste of cooked mangoes - apart from that followed the recipe exactly and turned out perfect! Have made this many times and there are never left overs!

Excellent coffee cake. I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 and I'm so glad I did. I did cut the sugar in the cake batter to 1&1/2 cups in place of the 2 cups called for when doubled but it was still perfectly sweet. And I used a 12oz package of frozen raspberries but no mango. Had no problem with it being either dry or gummy. I baked it for 1 hour and about 5 minutes and took it out when my toothpicks came out with just a couple of crumbs clinging to them. Thank you Naples!

This was a good basic coffee cake/muffin. Great for an beginner baker. I still had some mangos left over from a dinner party. My friends thought it was a four star recipe. The texture of the Cake was light and fluffy with a bold mango flavor.  Great with any variations. I did a strawberry and blueberry crumb cake cupcake filled with mango curd and topped with strawberry whipped cream. To make the whip cream whip 1cup heavy whippingcream for about five minutes, and one tsp pure vanilla extract and add four tablespoons of fresh strawberry purée that's been reduced over medium heat. Add a little powdered sugar at a time, until sweet enough to your liking.

Naples,  I love your reviews and always look for them!  They're fun, well-written and spot on concerning the recipes.  
I wanted you to know that as I listen to news of Hurricane Irma, I'm thinking of you and praying for you and your hubby and family along with all those affected by the hurricane.
Keep up the great reviews, Naples 34102!

This cake tasted very much like a crumb topped muffin.  It was delicious.  I made it in the morning and served it to guests for breakfast/brunch and everyone loved it.  I used blueberries in place of the mango and cinnamon in place of the nutmeg.  I used my stand mixer and made sure to whip the butter and sugar very well.  When the batter was ready to go in the pan, it was quite thick and I was concerned, but it turned out perfectly.

The best crumb cake ever!  I made it as written.  I loved the fact that it wasn't real sweet.  I also sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar over each piece before serving as the submitted later suggested.  Next time I might try different fruits but really, why change a great combination!

Ok so the reason I'm writing this review is because I changed some things and they worked! If anyone else was wondering... I made this in a bundt pan. I put the crumb topping on the bottom and saved some for the middle. I used 2 eggs not 1 and I used almond extract with fresh raspberries. No mango because I didn't have it. I found this recipe looking for what to do with the fresh raspberries I had and a cup of left over buttermilk. Thank you Naples! Funny but you and i have the same tastes in recipes if I see you give something a good rating I usually know it will turn out very good.

1 20 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214974/buttermilk-mango-berry-crumb-cake/ ... This was a popular coffeecake in my house.  It even got an "I like this" from K, 18, right away.  That may seem like nothing, but usually if I don't ask, I don't know so immediate response?  Woooo!  :D  I liked this too, but it didn't turn out as expected.  I didn't add fruit & used an 8x8.  'Wish 9x9s were around still.  My 8x8 was just full, almost to the rim; but that was fine.  The batter is BEAUTIFUL!  You can tell it's going to be good by the batter.  The crumb topping, though, didn't bake into a crumb topping.  As bizarre as this sounds, it's as if it melted to the bottom.  'Not a crumb on top.  It was good cake with a kind of pineapple upside-down cake topping without the pineapple & much thicker, almost like candy, on the bottom.   I dunno what happened.  I really don't think it sunk through the batter, but it ended up on the bottom.  Maybe the fruit has something to do with it?!  'Shouldn't.  Dunno.  Good coffeecake.  Thank for sharing it!

This was so delicious!  I made it using gluten free flour and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again!

This pie is wonderful!  I did a double batch and cooked it on the rack second from bottom for 15 minutes @ 400, then 30 minutes at 325 as another reviewer suggested.  I had a large lemon which produced lots of zest and gave a nice flavor along with the juice.  I recommend using the thick Bavarian buttermilk rather than the watery store brand.  I, also, sprinkled the cinnamon on top rather than mixing it in.

I substituted cinnamon for the optional nutmeg as suggested in review. I think it could be five stars without cinnamon in cake batter. Texture was just right. Had a combination of fruit, a little bit of raspberries, mango and blackberries was perfect.
