Very rarely does my husband rate anything 5 stars, but this one he did enthusiastically.  I used a quality sausage, Johnsonville, and fresh plum tomatoes from the garden instead of the canned diced tomato.  I omitted the green pepper because we donâ€™t care for it but added a finely chopped large garlic clove.  Also, I chopped and sprinkled some assorted cheeses I had that needed to be used over the top.  The results were delicious.  This is very easy and tasty, and will be in my dinner rotation.

I thought it was easy and delicious. I omitted the margarine and added fresh garlic with the pepper and onion. Even my three-year-old finished all of his!

Only 3 stars, because I made several changes detailed later in the review. The changes, for me, bring this up to 5 stars. The sauce in this recipe simply is not a "Sauce" at all, in my opinion, as-is. However, it is a GREAT starter/base. I get that this is called ground sausage spaghetti, and maybe I'm missing the point. But I'll stick with a little more liquid in the sauce for a meal called Spaghetti. That said, I made this using Johnsonville mild Italian sausage and the flavor was really great. Kids loved it too. I, like another commentor, thought it needed much more sauce, so I added a jar that I had on hand... 24oz Zia Marinara I believe, but anything would work really. I also sauteed the onions and bell peppers in olive oil first until soft, as well as 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic. Then I removed the vegetables from the skillet and browned the sausage. I didn't bother to drain the sausage grease since there was basically none to drain. I added all the ingredients back into the skillet with the meat, including the extra jar of sauce, and allowed it to simmer on low heat for about an hour. The finished product was really, really quite tasty. Thick and flavorful. Served on slightly al dente spaghetti noodles, this meal was delicious, and this was a sauce that will probably become a regular for me.

It was really good. My wife doesn't like spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce and the like. She really liked the spaghetti I made with this recipe. Thank you. I will be making it this way from now on. I didn't change a thing.

Wasn't saucy enough, i added a jar of sauce to it. I also added garlic powder and a tad of black pepper.

It was simple and easy to make. The whole family loved it, even the 7yr old. I didn't need to add anything extra. I will be adding this to the recipe box!
