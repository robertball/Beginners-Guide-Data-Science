This bruschetta is great! (especially if you like garlic) I brought this to a potluck dinner and kept the cheese spread and tomato mixture separate from the bread and let the guests fix it themselves.... it was a hit! I intend to make it over and over again!

I was forced to use dried basil instead of fresh, but this still turned out great!  The cream cheese is not only tasty but practical because it keeps the tomatoes from falling off.  I will be sticking to this bruschetta recipe from here on out!

good recipe...I needed something quick to take to a church thing on a weeknight.  I used canned tomatoes to cut down on time.  The spread cheese is good on this, although you can use a cheaper brand with the same results.  I might consider making the tomato mixture way in advance, we had leftovers and the mixture tasted better the next day.  I put tiny cubes of mozzarella on top for looks and flavor. If your not eating right away I would suggest you make sure the toast is very hard...the tomato mixture will seep into the toast and make it softer.

Excellent recipe.  Not only is it super easy to make but it uses readily available ingredients (I had all but the cheese already in the pantry).  And, I think it just might be better than our favorite local restaurant's version!  Will be making this quite often and not just as an appetizer but for a light lunch or for dinner on a busy night.

Delicious! I made this triple garlic by spreading the baguette with garlic butter before toasting it for 13 minutes. I also doubled the fresh basil, very good.

This was delish! I made one change: I was low on tomatoes so I marinated some diced summer squash along with the tomatoes. (The yellow squash was very beautiful with the red tomatoes and green basil.) Whole family loved it--will make again!

This was delicious!  Even the kids loved it!  It was gone in no time.  I used Ciabatta bread instead of sourdough because that's what I had on hand.

Wonderful!  I can't have dairy, so I omit the cheese and this recipe is still great.  I usually add chopped chives or green onion too.

My husband and I liked this recipe but my daughter said it was just okay. It was easy and fast to make with simple ingredients. It was a great way to use up some of the basil and tomatoes from the garden.

Made this for my hubby's poker-game guys and it was devoured!  The only thing we changed was using spreadable goat cheese instead of Alouette.

Excellent! My friends really loved this. I used the Laughing Cow Garlic/Herb spread so it was lower calorie and still delicious! Definitely a recipe to keep on hand when a quick appetizer is needed.

Very good!  I was looking for a little snack for Hubs and me to have during the football game yesterday and I came across this recipe.  I had the Alouette and all the other ingredients, so I decided to give this a try.  I deviated from the recipe by brushing both sides of the bread with a little EVOO and toasting both sides under the broiler.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I would definitely make this again, but I will add the fresh basil just before assembling, as it turns very dark when allowed to sit in the balsamic dressing.  Another idea would be to just sprinkle it over the top.  Good recipe!

Amazing flavor!  Everyone loved it and wants the recipe :)  Only thing I didnt have on hand was cream cheese spread so I made my own with some dry onion mix and my own seasonings.  Loved that it wasnt soggy!!  Will definitely be in my Favorites!

Wow delicious!   I made this last night and it was so easy and good.  The cheese just ads to the flavored.  It's now a favorite recipe, and I can't wait for the leftovers.

This was the best bruschetta I've ever had. I used 1/2 pre-diced tomatoes from the produce dept. and half a jar of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil. I also got the basil from a tube of Gourmet Garden basil (also in the produce) and used minced canned garlic. My coworkers gobbled them up at the company potluck.

Great recipe.  I cut in half as I only had 3 tomatoes, but used the 2 cloves of garlic.  As I diced the tomatoes, I placed them in a strainer to remove additional liquid, then added the garlic and basil and let it sit on the counter for 45 minutes before seasoning with balsamic, oil, salt and pepper - tomatoes should never be refrigerated!

I used Boursin garlic and herb cheese spread, and it was a great moisture barrier, so the baguette slices stayed nicely crisp.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone I've made this for loves it - my mom said "It's not really my sort of thing but I can't stop eating it".  I serve mine on untoasted sourdough - it is a hit.

Very good.  I used a mixture of cream cheese, italian seasoning, and minced garlic for the cheese.  Worked very well.

I love this recipe and have made it a few times with only a few changes. I used regular tomatoes, seeded and chopped only because I had an abundance of homegrown tomatoes. I toasted the bread for 10 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  I divided tomato topping on bread slices then topped with mozzarella and broiled for 5 minutes or until cheese was melted.  Delicious!

I have never given a review, but had to with this.  SO very good!   My husband and I ate this for a meal one evening.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Took this to an impromptu dinner party last night and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again and again. I did add a few artichoke hearts chopped into the mix, but other than that followed the recipe as is.
