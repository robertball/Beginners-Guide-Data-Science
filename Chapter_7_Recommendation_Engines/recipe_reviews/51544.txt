Super recipe.  The spinich seems odd but it is the ingredient that makes the dish sooo good.

I am dieting so I modified a bit.  I used fat free cream cheese, 2% low fat cheddar cheese, & substituted 3 (boiled & shredded) boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the beef.

The whole family liked this one and that is definitely worthy of five stars in our house.  I couldn't find the creamed spinach so I just bought spinach and creamed it myself which was easy and the other thing is forget the bowls, just more mess to clean up. I mixed the spinach mixture in the spinach pot and the noodle mixture in the noodle pot;worked out great.  We'll make this one again.

This was DELICIOUS!!  I was a little skeptical about the creamy spinach flavour mixing with the meaty mexican pasta flavour, but WOW...what a flavour sensation!  This was one of the best casseroles I have ever fixed.  I could not find creamed spinach, so I just defrosted some chopped spinach and added a little milk and sour cream to the pot while it was defrosting.  Then I added the cream cheese.  I did not mix in bowls per the recipe, as I felt it was an unessecary step.  I had the 3 pot on the store (beef, pasta, and spinach) and then mixed the spinach in the spinach pot and the pasta, meat, salsa etc. in the beef pot.  My husband said that this is his new favorite meal!  Thanks!!!!  I would give it 6 stars if I could!!

Have made this many times and it has always been good.  If you're not into spinach and like spicy, use two packages of cream cheese and mix in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced jalapenos when softening it.

I made this recipes exactly as it was written. The first three bites were good, but after that the flavors just didn't taste right together anymore.

We love this recipe!  I only use about 1/2 lb of meat and sometimes use Rotel instead of salsa, and I usually make my own version of the creamed spinach, because I have a hard time finding what the recipe calls for, but it always turns out great.

Excellent and easy!  I even cooked this with cheaper/generic ingredients and used ground turkey...my roommates and I all loved it.
