UPATE 2: I tried this recipe on wild cod filets and it is by far the BEST choice of fish. If you don't get to marinade it for 3 hrs, it's OK. Just save the marinade and cook it into a sauce aferwards. I now like to place it on the top rack of the oven and broil it for 10-12 minutes or until it's done. This method is better than baking which also takes a longer time. But you will need to make sure it doesn't burn. This recipe has become one of my favorite!!!
UPDATE 1: I used this recipe again on halibut filet. It was just as tasty. I got to marinade the fish for 4 hours, but still kept the marinade and cooked it into a sauce. And the sauce made a difference. Cook time for the halibut was also around 20-25 minutes baked at 400 degree. ------- EXCELLENT marinate!!! I had a grilled fish dish at a Japanese restaurant last week and this marinade tastes just like it! My hubby who hates cooked fish enjoyed this too. We got frozen sea bass, so it might taste a bit fishy, this marinade really helps to reduce the fishy taste. The reason why I gave this a 4-stars is the sea bass isn't fully cooked at 400 degree for 7-9 minutes. It really took me 20 something minutes with baking instead of broiled and checked it by poking a fork through. I didn't have time to marinate it for 3-6 hrs, so I only marinaded it for an hour and cooked the marinaded for dipping. It was really good.

One word for this recipe.....YUMMYLICIOUS!!!  At least that should be a word.  Make sure to marinate the fish for at least 4 hours, use a hot pan (med to medium high heat) with just a touch of olive oil, and cook one side for two minutes to get a nice crust, and then turn over and cook for another five minutes covered.  Comes out moist and delicous!

Absolutely Awesome - the sea bass melts in your mouth - baked at 400 for 15 minutes - turning once - came out perfect. Marinated for full 6 hours - so easy and delicious. A definite repeat.

Well done, I pan roasted the sea bass in a hot pan with canola oil on a grill.  The recipe is easy, and if you get the fish to glaze properly, it is delicious.  Bok choy and rice is a great accompaniment.

Wonderful Flavor..  I had a nice piece of Halibut and some jumbo sea scallops... marinated them together for about six hours... baked at 400 for 3min and then broiled at higher heat for about 6min... They came out perfectly cooked.  brought the leftover marinade to a simmer for about 4-5 min... wonderful sauce to serve along with fish, rice, and fresh asparagus...  garnished with chive stems to look like it was served in a fancy Asian resturant.......

I gave this two stars because it smelled delicious and that counts for something in my book.....but it DIDN;T get the rest of the three stars because it tasted absolutely terrible. I was SHOCKED when I tasted this fish because, again, it smelled SO good. But it really tasted bad. Too much rice wine or something...I would consider making this again and substituting the rice wine for something else or putting more of a teriyaki spin on it....but never again like this.

Wow. Easy recipe with delicious results! I marinated for 6 hrs; broiled and watched the seabass until edges started to darken; then I flipped and did the same. Moist and flaky. Accompanied with brown rice and sauteed spinach [with a tsp of garlic, salt, hon-dashi]. I recommend removing the fish skin prior to broiling [some markets will do it for you], so all sides have color and no risk of breaking the fish after broiling.

This marinade makes a glorious reduction.  Don't pour it out!  The green onions are a must.  Perfect ying and yang.  Thank you!

Truly excellent.  For those that didn't like it I suspect it may have been the fish and not the recipe.  We got sea bass steaks (with some skin) at a fish place and they came out very juicy and the fish was soft and flaky.  We broiled in the oven (skin on the steak) until the miso carmelized and then moved down to lower-mid rack for a total baking time of 10-15 minutes.  We served with the braised baby bok choy from marthastewart and white rice for a perfect pairing!

This is the 2nd time I've used a miso paste glaze on fish and it is spectacular.  I thought this sauce was a tad too sweet, but my husband disagreed and loved it with the brown sugar.  I'll probably put in a smidge less next time.  I only had cod but it was a suitable replacement for the sea bass.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe, Swest.

YUM!! It was soo good! I used a black cod instead of the sea bass with this recipe and marinated it overnight. I baked it for 12 minutes at 400 degrees in the oven. It was awesome! I'm already craving for some more already! Will definitely do this again.

I'm not a fish lover, but this was so un-fishy and delicious that I can't wait to have it again.  We grilled it for about 9 minutes each side (it was a very thick piece) and enjoyed it for Mother's Day.

Perfect !  I have made this where I bake it and pan sear it and they have both turned out perfect.  I reduce the remaining marinade and drizzle it over the sea bass as well as brown rice.  It pairs perfectly with the bok choy.  One variation that I did was add about 1-2 tablespoon of fresh grated ginger to the marinade and it is my wife's favorite change.  I think it is really good but I still prefer the original recipe.  Why mess with perfection?

We've made this twice now and it is unbelievable. The fish cooks so perfectly, and the sauce is not too sweet.  We actually cook it in the toaster oven, which works great and makes sure that the house doesn't get too warm during the summer season.  We also reduce the marinade just a little (to make sure it's cooked through) and drizzle it over the brown rice and veges that we serve this with.  I look forward to Chilean sea bass sales!!!!  This honestly couldn't be any easier.  The rice takes about 30 minutes, and then we work on the veges about 10 minutes out and it all comes together with little to no effort.  Amazing!

I used this recipe for my first ever preparation of fresh Chilean sea bass.  I couldn't find mirin or sake at the last minute so I substituted both with sherry.  It still came out delicious.  I can't wait to try this recipe with all of the proper ingredients.

Very good!  I kind of also followed the Epicurious Recipe for "teriyaki-glazed sea bass in that I marinated the fish in the sake/mirin/soy/brown sugar and miso mixture 5 hours.

I also simmered half of the marinade for a "glaze" after the fish was done.

I did not like this recipe at all. I have eaten Chilean Sea Bass many times and love it. The fish was tough and fishy, not buttery and flaky. I was very disappointed.

This was absolutely AMAZING!!!....The Sea Bass was like butter in your mouth.  My husband was skeptical about eating it mainly he's not a fan of fish to begin with, but he went back for seconds and thirds!  I would definitely make this again!!!

I was really looking forward to making this but the sea bass wasn't  good, very fishy. I am going to try again with black cod. Really couldn't tell if it was the marinade or the fish making it so fishy/salty

We loved the marinade, but didn't like the fish.  How can fish be fatty?  Will try next time on another white fish.

This was delicious- however I couldn't find farm raised chilean sea bass like Blue Water Grill serves.

Loved this recipe! The sea bass just melts in your mouth. The green onion really adds a nice contrast. I marinated the fish for about 6 hours and served it with edamame and forbidden black rice.   Everyone loved it and it's super easy.

I am not that big of a fish fan. However, the wife and kids are. I have made this several times and must say, I have become a HUGE fan. This is outstanding! The only thing I do differently, I substitute more Mirin in place of the Sake. (personal choice). The wife says its better than any restaurant sea bass she has ever had. Thanks so much for a great dinner!

The marinade on this is absolutely to die for. I have made it twice already and plan on making it many many more times. Even my daughter loved it and she is a picky seafood eater. I made it with Sea Bass and also Turbot. It was wonderful on both.

Amazing, and easy! We had to use sesame paste instead of miso, but SO good. Can't wait to do it next time with miso.

I burnt the fish a bit but it was so perfect because I like my fish well, well done. The flavor was so good! My husband said it was better than our favorite sea bass at a popular restaurant we frequent. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe list. FYI I made the fish with a honey soy sauce shrimp, white rice and broccoli.

Outstanding. I substituted sherry for sake, added grated ginger, and cooked the sea bass on the grill for about 3-4 minutes per side after marinating for 6 hours. Heated the marinade and poured over the fish and sushi rice to serve. Had bok choy made from AllRecipes. Will make again. The sauce was fabulous!

Awesome recipe.  Easy to make but finding miso paste and mirin can be difficult in rural Kentucky.  Whole family loved it.  I just happened to see sea Bass at the store—fresh, I have looked for it for years and usually can’t even find it frozen, so when I saw it fresh I had to buy it.  I then started looking for a recipe.  Glad I chose this one—it’s my wife’s all time favorite.

I made this for my husband's birthday after I asked him what he wanted for dinner on his birthday. He requested Patagonian Toothfish, so I obliged. According to his opinion, this was a very tasty recipe. I on the other hand, (It was my first time eating this type of fish; I personally couldn't handle the texture and will next time choose a different fish.) loved the sauce, but not the protein itself.

Made for two on New Years Eve with Costco Chilean Sea Bass portions. The only adjustments, other than reducing amounts, was adding some quartered mushrooms with the Sea Bass and marinade and dropping the onions. I only had about 2 hours for it to marinade and then broiled it in a cast iron skillet. It turned out exactly as billed - melted in our mouths. My wife felt this was our best Sea Bass ever and I agreed. Served it with swiss chard and pink rice. Will definitely make again. Simple and delicious!

Didn't change a thing. Have made it multiple times for our dinner guests. They loved it and we do, too. The marinade can be made ahead of time. So long as you keep it refrigerated, it'll be ready to go when you need it.  Regarding the sake, sake comes in a multitude of varieties and prices. Because I'm not a connoisseur of sake I used the cheapest one I could find. It was perfectly fine.  As far as the miso, there are choices for this, too. I only used the mild miso paste.  ENJOY!

This was delicious!! And we were so relieved because we got Sea Bass for $29.99/pound. Yikes!  We followed the recipe to the letter with just a few mechanical tweaks. I ended up putting the marinade in the blender because the miso paste is very thick and hard to mix in. The blender did it lickety split. 

I felt the cooking instructions were a bit vague and the comments made them even more confusing. It looks like some people baked this at 400. Some people pan seared it. I stuck with the instructions to broil it. My oven has a broil setting that is at 500 degrees. I really wanted to get the caramelization which happened really fast on broil.(less than 4 minutes/side) I then turned the oven to bake at 350 and moved the rack down and baked it for about 7 minutes.  

We can't wait to try this again on cod, salmon and halibut. It's a keeper!

Great recipe! I followed it exactly and it turned out great! I saved half of the marinade and used it to sauté shiitake mushrooms and bok choy to serve with the sea bass. This tasted better (and definitely more affordable) than restaurants. I will be using this marinade with other fish as well to see how it turns out!

This recipe is excellent. I've had this dish at really fancy five star restaurants and just had to have it at home.  I can't emphasize enough, the true success of this recipe is in fresh ingredients.  Please do not cheap out on the fish.  Fresh fish is crucial.  All the comments on the fish smelling fishy, tasting rubbery  are results of really "Old" frozen sea bass.  I am speaking from experience.  As for the sake don't skimp out and use cooking wine.  The cooking wine almost always has added salt and will change the flavor.  My rule when cooking with alcohol is if you won't drink it then don't cook with it.  In addition, I added some sliced ginger to the marinade for flavor.

Hardest part about this is knowing where the miso paste is at your grocery store (look near the tofu in the refrigerator aisle).  I'm sure it's better if you marinate it for 4 hours, but it's just fine if you marinate for 1 hour. I did this, broiled each side for 8 min and made a reduction sauce out of the marinade. DELICIOUS!!!

I followed the recipe to a tee.  I found the Chilean sea bass and all the other ingredients at an Asian supermarket. (Whole foods also had everything, but was twice as expensive).  My wife loves seafood and can be very critical  The resulting dish was amazing!  Our guests praised the looks, taste and texture of the fish.  My wife was overwhelmed.  This recipe is four star restaurant quality!  This is going into my "Do it again file".

I have made this recipe many times and it gets better and better.  Couple of things i tried differently...i like the red miso best...it has good flavor and does not overpower the fish.  also, marinating longer is better; next, you have to really "whisk" the miso and other ingredients for a while to get all the lumps out...and i double the recipe....it literally soaks the fish....finally, ask for the tail end of the chilean sea bass as it has the least amount of bones and is really tender.  i have a fear of fish bones!

Chilean sea bass was on sale at a local market and my husband was doing the shopping. Little did I know I had the prior weeks flyer.  With that said, he bought 1 1/2 pounds at $23.99 a pound and didn't notice until we unpacked the car.  I panicked a bit as I didn't want to ruin the fish with a recipe I hadn't tried.  Well this recipe was as good as or even better than what I've had in expensive restaurants.  I too baked at 400 degrees until done and reduced the marinade to drizzle on top.  It makes a lot of marinade so I refrigerated half and are doing this same recipe with a thick cod loin tonight.  Definitely a keeper but check those sale flyers!!

Just outstanding!  Maybe a little on the sweet side, but we cleaned our plates anyway!  Want to try again with cod, or similar fish as sea bass is way expensive, and being over-fished.

Nah! This works better with salmon. Maybe the sea bass I bought was off, but the texture was rubbery.

This recipe is hands down amazing! I tried it with both black cod and sea bass (steak and filet) and both taste great. One of the most memorable dishes of my trip to Honolulu last fall was "miso butterfish" at a Japanese restaurant, and this tastes JUST like it! No joke. I don't think I will ever order this dish at a restaurant again because I can make the exact same thing at home. Personally I like to top the fish with lots of green onion. The only downside is the marinating time so you have to plan ahead when you make it. This recipe is definitely a staple! One of these days I'll try it with salmon too.
