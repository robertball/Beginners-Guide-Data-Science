Quite tasty.. and yes you will need to add milk or cream as this gets very thick. I used milk and it tasted very nice

Absolutely divine. I followed the recipe closely but added a few twists. I used diced tomatoes w/chiles, added 2c  of vegetable broth and 1/2c of chardonnay with the tomatoes. I let it simmer for an hour, pureed the whole thing for a smooth texture and then stirred in 1/2 c of heavy cream.  For anyone wondering it made me about 7 cups and each cup was roughly 215 calories.  I may try fresh tomatoes next time to try and lower the sodium a bit. Also with the addition of the chiles I left out the cayenne pepper and it still had a nice kick.

I am addicted to this soup!  I made it exactly as written.  I love that you can blend it more or less, or thin it out more or less to suit your preference.  I love this recipe so much that I bought myself an immersion blender to make the job easier!  I toss in some croutons at the table.

Lovely flavor combination with the Rosemary, leeks and tomatoes. I also added some tomato paste and chicken broth and did not include the basil. Mine ended up with a nice bisque quality. Nice soup!

After adding the canned tomatoes, I added about 3 1/2 cups of veggie broth as without that it didn't seem that it would ever get to quite the right consistency for soup.  I brought that to a boil, then reduced the heat to low and simmered for just 15 minutes to let the flavors meld together.  I blended the whole batch then added 1/2 cup of half and half to give it a bit of body.  I also used only 1/8 cup butter instead of a full 1/4 cup to save on calories.  All in all, yummy!

Loved it, as did my 2 year old and husband! We liked the consistency better with the heavy cream, and used tomatoes fresh from the garden.

I followed recipe as written - was using up some leeks from the farmer's market and an abundance of tomatoes from the garden!  I love a chunky soup so didn't puree until smooth.  I also didn't add the cream until serving (depending on the diner - my mom prefers low cal) and it wasn't missing a thing!  Could easily be a veg soup without the cream!

I have made this more times than I can count, it's that good.  I use wild leeks and wild garlic, and fresh organic tomatoes from the garden.  I've never tried it with canned.  But fresh tomatoes give this exactly the right amount of liquid, and there is no need to add stock.  I blend it in the pot with a stick blender when it's done.  Sometimes I add cream.  Sometimes I don't. It's great both ways.

I wasn't expecting the spectacular taste this soup has. It's absolutely yummy!
I made it as written except I had to sub a can of  Rotel tomatoes with green chili's because I was short a can of tomatoes in my pantry.I left off the cayenne pepper and the soup had a nice kick. The flavour combination of Rosemary and leek, and Basil and tomato was brilliant. 
This soup is going on my rotation. Thank you so much for sharing, Lunacity. : )
