I followed the recipe exact, only cutting the brown sugar back by half. The pancakes turned out a little flat but they were delicious. I served them with homemade Maple-Vanilla Syrup on top. I will make these again but double the amount of baking powder. Then, I think that would make them perfect. NOTE: This made 12 pancakes, using a 1/3 cup dry measuring cup to ladle the batter onto my griddle.

The serving size must be a typo. It should probably say it serves between 2 and 4 people. I cut the recipe in half and it fed my son & I. It made 10 smallish pancakes. I cut the baking soda & powder by just a tad and my pancakes were very, very fluffy. I had to smoosh them down a bit. I did have to add a bit more milk, which I hate to do since it makes you mix them more. But, the flavor was very, very good! I used White Whole Wheat and less vanilla (personal preference, I'm not a huge fan of vanilla in pancakes). I used a bit less brown sugar. I just used Pam instead of oil in the pan. Thanks for sharing your family recipe, I'll make it again!

I love vintage recipes and this World War II recipe is one to treasure.  Without a doubt, it’s the best whole wheat pancake recipe I’ve tried.   I used white whole wheat flour and vegetable oil in place of applesauce.   The batter was extremely thick and more consistent with a muffin batter.   For me, an ideal pancake batter should be thick, yet pourable.  I added more milk until I got the consistency I wanted.   Following the recipe directions, I used 2 Tablespoons of batter per pancake.  I got 24 cute little medallion sized pancakes.  Hardly big enough for a single serving as suggested by the recipe, but they say times were hard during WW II.  People had to ration back then and maybe that was all you got.  I don’t know?   I just know these little gems were light, fluffy, and flavorful.  The only thing you have to be careful with is not to overcook them or they get dry and crumbly.

This was a great recipe. My dough ended up being a little thick so i had to add 1/4 cup more milk after which it was pourable. The pancakes themselves were pretty filling, we ate them for dinner and I could only have two pancakes using a 1/4 cup measuring scoop to pour and my husband had 5. I took Sarah Jo's suggestion of adding more baking powder, I added an additional 1/2 tsp of both baking powder and baking soda and they were super thick and fluffy. If you don't like thick I would advise against increasing the raising agents that much.  

It was a bit on the sweet side and I would probably reduce the sugar to 1/3 or 1/4 cup next time. I put in strawberries but it was too sweet with all the sugar to put in the chocolate chips I normally throw into pancakes or even to serve with syrup.

I used banana puree instead of applesauce, because I didn't have any and didn't want to use so much oil. I added some cinnamon and allspice. I also tripled the recipe, because I have a big family. This turned out really well, and a little batter makes a big pancake.

Very good! I mixed the wet ingredients first then added in the dry ingredients so I only had one bowl. I also reduced the sugar by half. For whole wheat flour, you can increase the airiness by stirring more actually, so I whisked the mixture for a minute or two before cooking and then were so fluffy!!

I made changes based on what I had on hand, but nothing that should have changed the outcome of the recipe. I used half whole wheat and half barley flour, halved the brown sugar, and replaced one egg with 1/3 cup more applesauce, and they turned out AMAZING. They were thick and substantial and delicious and I will make them again!

I was surprised at how good these tasted!  The grainy texture might throw some people off who are used to white flour pancakes, but the taste is so yummy!  My kids loved them and so did I!
I decided to take some reviewers suggestions.  I added an additional 1/2 tsp of baking powder and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  The pancakes rose well and had a wonderful sweetness to them.   
If I had had applesauce I would have used it as suggested, but I didn't so I added 3 tablespoons plain greek yogurt and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil.  I just couldn't stand the thought of pouring 1/2 cup of oil into my pancakes.  
They turned out wonderful.  I think I'll add 2 tsp cinnamon next time when I make these again with the applesauce.
Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Great simple recipe. Due to an allergy we used 2 flax eggs instead and to loosen it up I used a bit of AODA water. It turned out great! We used in a waffle iron and did take a while to cook through. Baby and toddler love them.

These pancakes have really great flavor! I had to sub water for the milk and they were still wonderful.  I did add a little extra water to get the consistency I wanted.   Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These pancakes were excellent and had a great texture. Since I put maple syrup on them ( like most people do ) I found it just a little sweet. Next time I would ruduce the amount of sugar. But other than that they were great and I would recommend them. Thank you

I used oil instead of applesauce (as the poster describes was in the original recipe), and I added 1 TBL Cinnamon, 1 cup chopped Walnuts, plus 1 cup dark chocolate chips.  They were perfect.  They didn't need any syrup or anything other than a little butter.

The best wheat pancakes we have found! I ended up adding 1/2 cup more milk, but kept everything else the same. These deliciously thick, slightly sweet pancakes will be made again and again in this house! I originally made the batter ahead of time, for a camping trip, but had to try them first! Thank you Gramma Momo!!

All I had on hand was regular self rising flour to use in this recipe. I cut back to 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder.  They turned out great.

We love this! I use 1 1/2C milk and omit the sugar. I make a caramel syrup similar to kneaders (warm equal parts brown sugar: heavy whipping cream: corn syrup) so I cut the sugar from the pancakes and don't know the difference because of the syrup. Thanks for sharing!

Here’s a delicious and healthy way to start the day.   I used 3/4 whole wheat flour to 1/4 all-purpose flour because I find using total whole wheat a little too much for us.  I also added blueberries out of habit.  It’s a thick batter but easily spreadable with the back of the ladle.  Note: The serving size is off.
