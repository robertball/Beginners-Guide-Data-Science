This is a very, very good white cake.  White cakes can be very tricky so be sure to follow the directions carefully.  This will ensure a moist, delicious white cake. This is very similar to Heavenly White Cake which has great reviews.  This has a bit more cake flour and sugar and an extra egg white. It produces (3) 9 inch layers where as Heavenly White Cake produces (3) 8 inch layers.  As with Heavenly White Cake, I used butter vs. shortening and used 1 & 1/2 cups of milk which may account for the additional moistness.  I also doubled the vanilla.  Be sure to whip your egg whites!!!  If you need detailed instructions view the ones for Heavenly White Cake - it'll be a big help.  Both are delicious.  I filled this cake with seedless raspberry jelly and "Whipped Cream Frosting" from this site.

As a professional baker, you CANNOT change a recipe and then complain it did  not turn out. Using egg yolks instead of whites would ruin any white cake. You're whipping them for a reason. 

Great recipe! ;)

This is extremely close to my Great Grandmother's recipe. She calls for 1/2 c more sugar, 1 tsp less baking powder and 1/2 tsp more almond. I also use whipping cream instead of milk. Follow the directions! Sift cake flour THEN measure 3c. Sift all dry ingredients again. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment, do not grease them. Fluff the shortening with half the sugar so it has a frosting like consistency. This will create air bubbles in the fat. Adding cold eggs or milk will deflate the air you worked hard to create! Also be sure to beat your egg whites until soft peaks form by using the other half of the recipe sugar and ONLY egg whites. If you add yolks it will not fluff up right and you will not have enough air. This will take about 10 min. Don't deflate mix as you're adding the dry and wet ingredients. Do this by adding the most amount of dry first to coat with the fat before starting to add the cream. *Mix by hand* Do not over mix once the baking powder has been activated (mixed with the wet). You should have to spread your cake into the pans, not pour. It will be visibly bubbly! Oven temperature is also key - must be a steady 350. Even if you follow directions, a faulty oven will spoil it all. Have a suspended thermometer to make sure your oven temp is correct (25deg too hot or cold makes a huge difference). **Do not open the oven or it will fall! Send running children outside!** Let the cake cool in the parchment lined pans.

This turned out to be the best white cake I ever made. It was rich and moist and everyone raved. I used all purpose flour and accidently one more egg white. I'm planning on making this again many times. Great recipie!

HOLY COW !!!!! this cake is awesome !!!
The key to making it is to "FOLLOW THE STEPS TO A TEE" I used it for a base for a coconut cake i substituted coconut milk for, cows milk and coconut extract for the almond. I also used 3 9" pans for 3 layers instead(It seemed like too much batter for only 2), which ended up a blessing in disguise, i made cocnut frosting and toasted coconut for the 2 layer, and frosted the 3rd seperately with lemon frosting and served it with a scoop of sweetened crushed pineapple !!! 2 cakes for my function out of one recipie !!!

I was looking for a "wedding" type cake and this is so it!  Great and easy recipe.  Baked it in a 9" x 13" pan so I could decorate it for my son's birthday and it only took 28 minutes to bake.  Love it!

I really liked this cake, it is dense but very good.  I only had vanilla extract so i used about twice what it called for, also taking advice from another review i added 1 TBS veg oil.  Came out great, moist, and sweet.  I made some cream and dolloped on top, YUM YUM!!  Very good will make again!!  Next time I'm going to try and marble it, place more than half into dish then add some cocoa powder to what is left and marble it in.  Should be really good.  Can't wait.

I used this recipe for my cake decorating class-final graduation cake- and it was a perfectly formed two layers, perfect heigth with no dome and not too dense. And it was wonderfully fragranced to boot. All this can only be acheived if you use CAKE flour, and follow the directions which say beat egg whites and FOLD into mixture. If your cake was dense it means you stirred the air out of the whites when you added it to the batter. This will be my go-to recipe in the future for white cakes. Great recipe.

I used this recipe for my Easter cake this year - it was so wonderful - not gluey like alot of white cake recipes.  I used a butter and shortening mix cake frosting from Taste of Home - it was hard to stay away from!

This was awesome! I loved it. I made this for Easter and made a buttercream to ice it with, perfecto. I was a little timid about making it, since I have been known to mess up cakes occasionaly, but this turned out great! I took the other viewers advice and added another half cup of milk, we only had a little shortening, so I used what was left and finished it up with butter. My family loved this, it was gone in a day!
Will definatly make again. :)

Very good cake. It's great on it's own, or with frosting, or possibly as the base for a less sweet Gooey Butter Cake. I did alter the recipe some---either I was out of something, or I wanted to experiment. My edits included: 1/2 c. of sweetened condensed milk + 1/2 c. of water instead of milk; 1 c. of granulated sugar + 3/4 c. of homemade powdered sugar; a splash more vanilla. One thing I did wrong that I didn't realize until just now is that I folded the egg whites into the batter, rather than whipping them to soft peaks first. I wrote the instruction down incorrectly! Still tastes good, moist and dense, though slightly dry. Next time, I will use butter and shortenining, whip egg whites, and add more vanilla.

This did not turn out anywhere near as I had hoped. I cooled the cakes on a wire rack and after they cooled, I was able to hold up the cakes. They look like a giant sugar cookie. They were very dense. I cut up the cake in squares and will put some strawberries on it because the cake tastes just like a shortcake biscuit! My husband said he will take a slice and put some jam on it for breakfast tomorrow!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfectly - almost pound cake like.  It was moist, not too sweet and the perfect consistency for fondant.  I'm not a great baker, and this one is in my file as my "go to" cake.

Just finished making this cake...only one problem, I wish I had gone with my first instinct to make it in 3-9 inch pans...I didn't and the cake spilled over a little,  not unfixable, but I hope the extended cooking time time did not dry out the cake. I made it for a birthday cake at work...I will have to let you know tommorrow how everyone likes it...or not...Next time I make this cake I will but it in 3 pans. FYI:  I stirred in some of those little pastel colored, confetti candies into the cake batter and when I made the frosting (a white cream cheese frosting), I put about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in along with the vanilla, (just like that cake called for).

This is a good cake. Before I folded in the egg whites the batter looked heavy and I thought this would be a dud.  But, the cake has a great texture and it tastes great.

Just ok.  My husband said it tasted like a huge pancake.  I agree with other viewers, it had a corn bread flavor and consistency.  Maybe I need a better grade of flour.?? I used a homemade cream cheese frosting on it which really saved the cake.  But I could probably eat a shoe if it had cream cheese frosting on it.

I made this cake last week-end and it was very, very dry. I bake a lot of cakes and this one was hard to eat. It claimed to be very moist but it was the opposite. Don't waste your time on it.

Delicious cake. Recipe should be followed EXACTLY. For beginner bakers, loose whites will cause a cake to collapse in the center while in the oven. (I made this mistake.) Take care to beat the egg whites till fluffy/stiff and fold in mixture as directed.  

If you find that your palette is sensitive to the taste of shortening, then consider researching how to substitute with oil or margarine. 

Made a basic 5-minute vanilla icing. Worked quite well.

I made this into cupcakes.  It was fluffy and moist, which was great, but tasted and smelled like a pancake.  Next time I'll add some fruit and make muffins with it!

It was okay but I will probably keep looking for a go- to white cake recipe.

I was impressed by the reviews for this recipe so my daughter and I used it for her birthday cake - BIG mistake. Despite following the instructions exactly it tasted awful, entirely like shortening and baking powder. It looked nice, light, moist and fluffy but the taste was so bad we had to scrap it and use a cake mix I had in the cupboard. Maybe if we had used butter instead of shortening it would have been ok but I can't understand all the great reviews!

The flavor was delicious! I made it for my Mom's birthday party, and we had not a bite left; everyone cleaned their plates!  My cake did fall a bit, I think because I opened the oven door to check it when I shouldn't have.  However, it looked nice once it was frosted. I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil as suggested by another reviewer; otherwise, followed the recipe step by step.  Thank you for a great recipe.

It was pretty good... I used 2 eggs and 1 egg white instead of 5 egg whites. I've had better white cake though, so I'll keep searching for another recipe.

I was looking for a white cake from scratch and thought I would try this one and turned out to very good. I added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla just for extra flavor. It was very moist and was a big hit with my husband and daughter. I did make the white mountain frosting to go on top.yummy

I got asked to make a Birthday cake for my Niece so I wanted to test out a new recipe So I decided on this one!For me this recipe was just ok!It wasnt horrible but it wasnt Wonderful. Iv tried it twice first time as written and the end result was very dense and had a strong egg smell while it baked.I decided to try it a second time used 3/4 cup butter an additional 1/4 cup vegetable oil and added 1/2 cup sour cream. With my tweaks it was definitely fluffy but still not the best it reminded me of a sugar cookie lol. This probably wont be the cake I choose for the Birthday It just wasnt what I was looking for.But I do love trying different recipes :)  This cake will not go to waiste Im eating a slice as I type lol Thank you for sharing!!

Way good! It is as moist & fluffy as a boxed mix, but without any additives. Love it!!! Will make again & again.

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews.  Thought it'd be a sure thing.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a cake that smelled wonderful.  however, the taste was boring and it had a odd consistency.  I could taste and feel uncooked flour.  I'm not a novice baker, I'd say intermediate, but this recipe just didn't come out great for me.

This cake is beautifully white with no egg whites, even though I used butter, and delicious!

This is a fairly dense cake but it's very tasty.  The almond extract is a must.  I used cream cheese frosting on it and it was a nice pairing.

Great cake. Dense, moist, delicious. It's very important to beat the egg whites until they are stiff and to be very gentle when folding them in. I frosted these cupcakes with sturdy whipped cream frosting, which was a bit of a boring combination. The ones where I had added some chocolate chips in the batter were better so I will either do that for all of them next time, or I will frost with chocolate frosting. Overall a great cake.

Followed almost exactly (but I always use original almond milk in place of cows milk and I used organic salted butter in place of shortening) and it makes a nice large amount...enough for 24 fluffy cupcakes which I arranged in an airplane shape for my sons 2nd birhtday. However my cupcakes were very dry :( Will try again and follow advice of some other users to increase milk to 1 1/2 cups. Had a great taste though.
