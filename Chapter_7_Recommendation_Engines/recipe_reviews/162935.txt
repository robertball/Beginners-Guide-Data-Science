I made this one for the *RECIPE GROUP* here's my review... I can't believe I'm saying this but this recipe was WAY too sweet AND didn't have enough coffee flavor to me... I could barely get through my whole glass... something HAS to change. Probably won't make it again, but thanks anyway! :)

Awesome!!! If you want the recipe to be as close to the White Chocolate Mocha at Starbucks, add about a total of 3 1/2 cups of milk.
Fantastic recipe!!!

Refreshing and a lot less expensive than the coffee or ice cream shops.  Can also use chocolate ice cream and/or chocolate syrup instead of the cocoa mix.  Add in your own "extras" like chocolate chips, etc.  Personal taste preferences make this recipe very versatile.

I made this for Recipe Group (a week late).  Since I am on Weight Watchers and did not want to sabotage my 20 lb. loss, I used all sugar free/fat free ingredients I could: 1 envelope Nestle No Sugar Added Hot Cocoa Mix, skim milk, and Breyer's Smooth and Dreamy Fat Free Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream.  Then I split this with my husband, making this 180 calories, 0 fat, and 4.5 grams of fiber = 3 WW points per serving.  I liked it, although it probably could have used the other packet of hot cocoa mix to make it more chocolatey. I will definitely make this again.

At 700 calories I couldn't bring myself to try this, but my very slender DD said she would be my tester.  She found it cloyingly sweet, lacking in coffee flavor and much too thick.  We played around and came up with a pretty good alternative:  1 packet Hot Choc. mix, 1/2 c 1 per cent milk, 3/4 c Vanilla frozen yogurt, 1 tbs instant coffee granules.  We whirled that in the blender with some crushed ice and it was more to our taste.

I love this recipe so much. Tastes just like the mocha moolattes from DQ. I usually half it though, just because there are so many calories and carbs in it.

I edited this to reflect a low-sugar, lower calorie "way of life". This was actually my first real "sweet" treat in almost two weeks. I used two packets SF hot chocolate, FF milk and 1/2 c. fat free vanilla frozen yogurt and I split this with my older boy. This was good, even with my changes. I felt less guilty with my changes. I think I'd cut back on the ice next time and only use one packet of cocoa mix. I think maybe using two packets of instant coffee granules (I actually found a box of those individual packets at Grocery Outlet and each packet makes one cup of coffee. New one on me. Obviously.) and one packet of hot cocoa mix to get more of a mocha flavor. You really need to blend the heck out of this to get the hot cocoa and coffee granules to fully dissolve.

Delicious!!! ( : I didn't have any  instant coffee granules so I used the coffee my Mom had made already. I'm only a teen so I didn't want my Frozen Mocha very strong, so I only put in about 3 to 4 tablespoons of already made coffee and it tasted great! Love this recipe!

I tried this for the recipe group, figured it would be sweet but ooh la la that was extremely sweet.  I only made 1/2  the recipe just to tyr it, added more milk and that helped. Even the kids found it sweet.

Fantastic recipe! With a dietary need, I was able to use a Splenda based recipe cocoa mix from allrecipes, Sugar-free Vanilla Ice Cream, 1% milk, decaf coffee granules & fat free whip...I know it sounds like I took the fun out of the drink, but the fun was being able to enjoy it like my kids can. It was hmmm mmm mmmmm good! I didn't taste much coffee for myself. I can personally add a tad more for my liking, however, I didn't have any complaints from others in that department. It will totally be on the keeper list for sure! We found it amazing to the hit me right there stop for a chocolaty fix! TY TY

I just wanted a frozen hot chocolate and this was perfect! I left out the coffee and used French Vanilla ice cream because that's what I had and it is fantastic! I will definitely be using this recipe a lot this summer!
