Easy to make, taste is good too. Gluten free baking is hard, due to the flours it can often taste chalky or floury. This recipe did have that slight taste but it was super moist which was nice. I love the use of applesauce. I made cupcakes instead of a cake because of the event I was making them for. Took about 14 minutes in the oven, rotating the sheet halfway through. I topped the cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting and they were extremely delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe it will definitely be made again!

Our entire family loves these as cupcakes! The recipe is great as is but personally I have made some shortcuts that make them easier and turn out great! I use JULES AP GF flour mix instead of all the different flours listed (2 1/2 cups), eliminate the xanthan gum as JULES has that covered in her flour mix. and I use the pretty cupcake liners for the muffin cups for easy clean-up.  To make them dairy-free I use almond or soy milk + 1 Tbsp vinegar to = the buttermilk. I also am now adding 2 Tbsp of  "cake enhancer" by King Arthur Flour to make them stay fresh longer. It is a great product and gluten-free.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My daughter-in-law made this recipe for her daughter's 2nd family birthday party.  She made it into cupcakes and they were delicious!  They did not taste gluten free and were moist.

I am not on a gluten free diet, however, I made these for the baby shower of a friend who has celiac.  They were very tasty and moist.  The texture is good and there is no strange aftertaste like sometimes happens with gluten-free baked goods.

They were a hit at the party as well.  The guest of honor said they were the best gluten-free cupcakes she had ever had.  Her sister ran over to tell the guest of honor not to eat them as she was convinced they couldn't be gluten free after eating them.

For people who plan to make cupcakes, this recipe will make about 2 dozen.  Another reviewer said the batter was thick like dough.  I did not find that to be the case at all.  It had a normal cake batter texture.

You have restored my faith in gluten free desserts.  I can now comfortably say delicious and gluten-free in the same sentence.  

I replaced the buttermilk with coconut milk and they still turned out FANTASTIC!

My husband's favorite cake is Red Velvet; I tried baking it twice when we got married and failed miserably...didn't taste anything like his grandma's...dry, crumbly. 20 years and 4 kids later I gave it another shot because our youngest has a wheat allergy. This is the best cake that I've EVER made in my life, gluten free or not. So moist. Freezes well too. 2 tips: do as others suggested and use sugar to coat your muffin tins after spraying with cooking oil instead of flour which slightly sweetens the cake and they'll fall out of the tin easily. Using room temperature ingredients makes a HUGE difference. Don't skip that step. Make your own buttermilk with vinegar instead of buying some and save the money for all the flours. This is a keeper.

The taste of the cake was good, made even beter by a cream cheese frosting. Unfortunately the cake batter was more like the consistancy of dough after all was mixed. When the batter was put in the pan it had to be spooned into the pan and it did not spread out to fill the pan. After baking the cake was still very thick. if there is anyway to thin the batter would be great to know.

Very moist and delicate. I had a hard time removing them from the muffin tin, even though I greased them ( I didn't flour them and probably should have) I subed almond flour for the coconut only because I didn't have any.

can't believe i have been baking gluten free for 5 years and i just now found this recipe. it is really, really good. and the cake is the right texture. i actually left out the xanthan gum and it still worked just fine. also, i used rice milk with 2 thsp apple cider vinegar in place of the buttermilk so the cake itself would be non dairy. if anyone has a good cream cheese substitute for making a good frosting, let me know, it is hard to beat real cream cheese though! :)

This is far and away the best gluten-free dessert I've ever tasted. I made them into cupcakes and the cake had a beautiful crumb and was perfectly moist. It also rose nicely, and wasn't brick-like as many GF recipes end up being - exactly the right mixture of density and lightness. I can't praise this recipe highly enough - I got a ton of compliments on this. I'm not even the biggest fan of red velvet and thought it was spectacular. This recipe is a keeper for sure - I'll certainly be making it many more times in the future. I typically don't even bother trying to find GF substitutes for desserts as I inevitably find them disappointing, but the positive reviews persuaded me to try this - totally worthwhile. I paired it with a not-to-sweet cream cheese frosting and the result was perfectly decadent.

I found this recipe today and immediately made them with my 10 year old daughter. I am always the skeptic with gluten-free recipes, they are normally hit and miss but this one is a keeper! This recipe was easy to make and turned out moist, not crumbly or chalky. I baked them into cupcakes and used cupcake liners. The batter is thick, as other reviewers had mentioned but I had no problems with it. I used a large cookie scoop to scoop it into the cupcake well. When baking in 9" cake pans, I will just use a spatula to spread the batter evenly. I will add this to my file of best-loved gluten free recipes.

I took another's suggestion and made this easier by using 2 1/2 cups Pamela's Gluten Free All Purpose flour (can be found on Amazon.com for 11.37 for 4 lbs).  I did not make the paste, but added the food coloring directly into the wet ingredients with my mixer on low.  (From another non gluten free recipe I use to make red velvet cake).  Once I was done mixing the wet ingredients I took the mixing bowl off my kitchen aid and hand mixed the dry ingredients / butter milk with a whisk.  I found the first time I tried a different recipe with the Gluten Free Flour that it gummed up and was EXTREMELY thick, but mixing by hand it did not get TOO thick and made BEAUTIFUL cupcakes.  Also I just used what applesauce I had on hand, which had sugar added, but it's what I had.  My hubby has gone back for several cupcakes and I hadn't even put frosting on the them ;)  Can't wait to make them again for the baby shower I'm hosting for a Gluten Free friend!!

I made these for a celiac coworker. The batter tasted HORRIBLE but I went ahead and baked them anyway and they turned out fantastic. The chalky taste and texture baked right out. The celiac gobbled them up, and even the gluten loving coworkers enjoyed them. I thought the batter wasn't quite sweet enough, but no one else seemed to notice. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing, ktonks!

I made a dozen of these for my church's bake sale table at the holiday bazaar this weekend, and they were gobbled up in less than an hour!  At least a half dozen people asked for the recipe.  Nobody could believe they were gluten free!  I made two small substitutions:  I used safflower oil instead of canola oil, and I only had a cup of white sugar in my cupboard so one-half cup of the 1-1/2 cups of sugar was brown sugar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as given.  I will definitely be making this again in the near future!

I am sorry to say, but this recipe did not come out to red velvet. Yes, I followed it to the T, but it just didn't come out. It may be my fault, but the cake didn't come out red, so I assume it is my fault because I didn't have 1 ounce of red food coloring (I only had 0.3 ounces, and squeezed EVRYTHING I could out of the tube). The coco powder, vanilla extract, and red food coloring didn't come out as a paste that I though it would. This was my second recipe trying to make gluten-free red velvet cake, and a second failure making an actual red velvet cake. Will not make again... (Sorry, ktonks!!!)

Excellent recipe!  I made this for Christmas, with Alton Brown's red velvet cake cream cheese frosting.  I made two layers, and it's not a really tall cake, but the texture is very good.  If no one told you it is a GF cake, you would not know - and that is the true test for me.  Thanks!

I had gluten free flour, so I used that instead of rice flour, sorghum flour and xantham gum. Also reduced to 1/4 cup of tapioca starch, 1 cup of mayonnaise in place of canola oil and 2 % milk with apple cider vinegar instead of buttermilk. I know, that's a lot of changes but really substitutes for what I had. I make it two layer cake style. It was super moist and the whole family loved it! Topped it with goat cheese frosting. Can you say AWESOME!!!!!

These are very good but I ALWAYS use organic extra virgin olive oil in baking, I cannot taste the olive oil in baked goods.  I keep the oven at 325 degrees for all baked goods.  
I used half the sugar and added a little stevia powder. I stirred a small chunk of cooked beet into the batter for color, then removed it instead of using food coloring.  With these changes I felt good about serving these.  Next time I'm going to try all purpose gluten free flour to save time... and experiment with a portion being coconut flour.  Thanks for the recipe, we love red velvet!

Great tasting, moist and YES, I'd make them again. A guest at a party had recently been put on a gluten free diet and I needed to make dessert.  I am so happy I found this recipe - like other reviews, many were asking "these are gluten free?".  Thanks for sharing this, it will become part of our recipe armor for years to come!

Very good cake. My partner has too many allergies to list here, so this recipe is a godsend. I have made it twice now. Both times I substituted Pacific brand rice milk in place of the buttermilk. The first time I made the cake with half canola and half butter; the second time I did it using only refined coconut oil. Both times my results were moist and very fluffy (especially in the case of the coconut oil), which is a delightful surprise considering it's gluten-free, and I'm very impressed with the recipe for this reason. The first time I made it the flavour was not chocolate-y enough for my liking, so the second time I made it I used half a cup of cocoa powder and a dash more oil, which was an improvement. (The next time I make this cake I might play around with some baking chocolate instead of the cocoa, to see if it makes for a deeper chocolate flavour.) I also added orange zest to the batter the second time, which was very delicious. For frosting I used a mixture of coconut oil, strained fresh-squeezed orange juice, and confectioner's sugar. A nice complement to a nice cake.

Hi, I made this and while the taste is delicious and it makes a wonderfully moist gluten free cupcake, the texture was quite grainy. Any idea what I did wrong? No one else seems to have had a problem with grittiness.

I could not find sorghum flour in my small town so used finely ground gluten-free oats. It turned out perfectly

Pretty good. I used a cream cheese icing recipe from cup4cup website (search red velvet cake). I did NOT use the red food coloring, and added a small egg since my batter was a little thick and I knew the extra coloring would add some liquid anyway. Moist. All guests liked it.

I made this on a whim. I used Arrowhead Mills gluten free all purpose baking mix rather than the flours in the recipe because it was what I had it in the pantry.  I also don't invest much in gluten free products because I am always disappointed. This is the best gluten free cake I have made. It is surprisingly moist.

These cupcakes are moist and delicious!  I didn't have brown rice flour, so I used millet flour instead.  Also, I added a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to the batter.  I didn't have a full oz of red food coloring either...in fact, I had less than 0.5 oz, but the cupcakes still turned out red enough.  I believe the vinegar and baking soda react with the cocoa to help produce some of the red color. Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I plan to make theses again and again, especially for birthday parties.

My birthday is next week and we are having a party this Saturday and a few friends are GF so I'm trying this recipe because I LOVE red velvet! I was wondering if the tapioca starch was part of the flour mixture or if it's a totally separate thing, I am a using an all purpose GF flour mix that I have on hand instead of all of the separate flours.

Red velvet cake from Salsbury House, a restaurant  in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada is my favorite cake.  I am willing to eat gluten to get it.  Now I have a recipe that gives me a quality cake that is safe to eat.  Made it for thanksgiving dinner and everyone is going to love it.  My husband loves it too!

I made this recipe into cupcakes for Christmas dinner.  I sprayed the cupcake pans and used sugar in a shaker to coat each "cup" (avoided liners that way) and the cakes came out easily.  This recipe is very good--as promised--especially with cream cheese icing!   

[Not a complaint--but a question:  The dough was very stiff.  I wonder if I could add some more buttermilk and/or applesauce to make dough a little lighter?  May try that next time.]

This cake was enjoyed by many.  People were surprised it was gluten free.  I iced it with milk chocolate, cream cheese icing and it was very, very, yummy.

Dear Julycious, based on my experience with coconut flour, I would recommend trying a bean flour such as garbanzo bean flour. I have had cakes with bean flour and have found them very tasty. Good luck.

Fabulous! Absolutely fabulous! I make this recipe when I need to bring a dish/dessert that my gluten-free daughter can enjoy at functions and no one else can tell they are gluten free! So wonderful!
