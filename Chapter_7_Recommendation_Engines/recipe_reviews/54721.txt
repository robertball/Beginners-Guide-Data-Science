Delicata squash is our favorite squash.  This recipe is similiar to the way I prepare it.  I usually cook my squah in the microwave after poking holes in it with a fork. Quick and easy.

This was terrible. I had to force both my daughter and my husband to eat it. Maybe if it had a little butter added it would have been better. It was so...paste like. I will never make this again. Sorry.

Great taste and easy to prepare.  I microwaved this to save time, water and nutrients.
