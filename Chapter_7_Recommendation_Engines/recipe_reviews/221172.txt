I baked this cake for a colleague at work because it was her birthday and everyone, I mean everyone, loved it! It is dense and with the frosting it is a very rich cake. I ended up having to make more frosting because I didn't have quite enough. That might have been because I baked a 9" round and not 8". My husband made a special trip to my workplace at lunch just so he could get a piece. He said he knew it would be good because he saw what went into it. I did not have any problem with the purée sinking to the bottom of the cake. It is a keeper!

I used white chocolate chips for the frosting because that's what I had. Turned out fine. The cake was really good. Will make again

I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and it was very very thick and dense, it tasted too much like flour, and the icing instructions weren't very clear. By that I mean it said to add the confectioner's sugar into the cream cheese and chocolate mix but didn't tell you to take it off the heat so I added everything thinking I was supposed to let it all melt together...I took it off to let it cool like instructed and within 10 minutes it was literally rock hard, very hard and I knew there was no way I'd be able to frost with it. So unfortunately all that icing had to be thrown away and I had to make another trip to the store to get more sugar. All that said it is still pretty tasty but I can't eat very much of it at one time...I got a moderate slice and could only eat about half as it's so thick. I probably won't be making this again.

Absolutely Amazing! So moist and flavorful and super easy to prepare. Made this for my younger brothers going away party everyone loved it. The frosting was simple to make and tasted great not too sweet and not too plain. Definitely keeping this recipe and will make again.

I made this as a test run before I make it for a birthday party.  The crumb/texture turned out great.  My only complaint is that it was really sweet,  BUT that may have had more to do with the fact that I sweetened my strawberries before I froze them.  My next attempt will use less sugar.
Update: used about 1/2 C less sugar and sweetened, 
frozen, strawberries and everything still turned out extremely sweet.  If I make this again I may gamble with a whole cup less sugar.

I made this for my husband’s birthday.  I followed the recipe precisely but added one additional stick of unsalted butter and used four extra large eggs.

Haven't tasted the cake yet but the frosting was very stiff and not spreadable. Even after adding 2 tsp milk it was difficult to work with.  I did sub 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips when the store did not have squares but I don't see how this would be an issue.  The flavor however was superb.

The cake was perfect.  The frosting was dry and hard to spread.

This cake was a big hit with both of my sons who both love strawberry cake.  The cake was very moist and has a powerful strawberry flavor and it is also super, super sweet. I thought it was too sweet.  The batter made too much to fill two cakes pans.  I had enough to make a 3 layer cake but then I didnt have enough frosting.  I will need to make some adjustments to make this again.
