Yum! Who knew you could improve on a taco salad simply by changing the way you put it together? I thought mixing the chips/cheese/tomato with the beef sounded odd (I don't know why, that's what you do after it's on your plate anyway, right?), but it really worked! I used my own taco seasoning & made a dressing of Ranch mixed with taco sauce. The only thing to consider is if you aren't going to eat the whole batch in one sitting, be sure to keep your meat, chips, tomato, etc. separate & combine for just as many servings as you're having right then.

This is a classic taco salad.  I love this for it's "makeaheadability".  I'll brown/season ground beef and freeze it in 2 serving portions.  Then, when I don't feel like cooking, I can thaw the preseasoned beef for easy taco salads, particularly when tomatoes and lettuce are plentiful in our garden.   We prefer to dress ours w/a mixture of salsa and light sour cream.  Beef, it's what's for dinner!

I've been making taco salad like this for years and it is very simple and quite delicious recipe. Instead of plain tortilla chips I like to use taco flavored Doritos, they just seem to add a bit more flavor. Ranch dressing adds a good zing and is a nice change from the French or Catalina dressings I'm used to on taco salad. Tip: use a paper towel blot out the grease from the cooked beef.

When I make this recipe I use nacho cheese flavored Doritos and mix in a cup or more of thousand island dressing. I usually mix it all together as stated but the chip do get soft and some people like more or less thousand island dressing, so sometimes I will put the chips and dressing on the side so everyone can mix there own serving so everything stays crisp and the lettuce doesn't get soggy from the dressing. Very good!

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written, except I used salsa instead of a diced fresh tomato. We thoroughly pigged out and enjoyed ourselves, and I'd love to play around with it in the future a bit, such as by adding drained black beans. Thanks, Beef. It's What's for Dinner. :)

I doubled this recipe. I used ground turkey, a homemade taco seasoning, used nacho cheese tortilla chips from Aldi, and I made a sour cream ranch-salsa dressing to go on the top. Even doubled there were no leftovers. Definitely a make again. (Everything in this recipe was bought at Aldi--the whole meal didn't cost more than 8 dollars to make. Not bad.)

I use two ways to decrease the sodium. I use "fresh salsa" from the deli, sometimes called pico de gallo. It's not cooked or canned. Mix the salsa with an equal amount of light or fat free sour cream. Use as a dressing on your tacos or taco salad. If you plan to add pinto beans, cook your own (control the sodium) or you can buy canned "no added salt" pinto beans. I also buy a "MEXICAN SEASONING" or "FIESTA MEXICAN SEASONING". It is sodium free and cheaper than buying all the different spices to make your own seasoning. I buy it at a local food coop or Sprouts. I also have two companies I can order from which is where the coop & Sprouts get their supply. Try FRONTIERFOODS.COM or BULKFOODS.COM. The only difference between the two seasonings is Fiesta has tomato powder added to it. Excellent flavor and definitely saves money. If you want to use chicken for your tacos or taco salad it is best to cook in slow cooker. Use boneless skinless chicken thighs (or breast), pour bottled salsa over & cook on low for about 6 hours. Make sure the chicken is submerged so it doesn't dry out. Shred the chicken with a fork & return to slow cooker to warm it up. Chicken is much lower in fat & calories.

Typical taco salad,  I think it's a geographical thing as to what the ingredients are. For us it needs pintos, Ortega chilis, Catalina dressing, had one w/ Fritos that was good.

Good flavor, but will lighten up on taco seasoning & tortilla chips on future salads.

This was pretty good but I felt that it was still missing something. Maybe jalapenos, sour cream, salsa or some of Valerie's Kitchen Creamy Tomatillo Avocado Salsa. It definitely needs cilantro.

This recipe tastes really strange....I think it's the dressing. No one in our family liked it.

My SIL used to make this all the time when I was a kid. She (and now I) use Catalina dressing, strictly lettuce as the greens and omit any olives/onions. My kids & I love it!

Yummy.  I made a couple of adjustments according to my taste, what was available, and a favorite childhood version of this recipe.  My favorite adjustment is to use Cool Ranch Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips.  Also added canned black beans, and Thousand Island for the dressing.  Thanks so much Beef. It's What's For Dinner.  Awesome, easy recipe.

Absolutely delicious! My family gobbled this up. I gave it four stars as I made it as is and I think next time I might add some chopped cilantro and perhaps some taco sauce for a little more punch. Crema Fresca would be good too. This is a definite keeper!
