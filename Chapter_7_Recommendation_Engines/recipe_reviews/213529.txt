This was edible but just barely. It needed serious flavor and was very bland not to mention it didn't taste like a Sloppy Joe either. We were hungry so we ate it but we added some BBQ sauce to it to at least make it palatable. Maybe with a LOT of doctoring up this could be decent but it;s far from it as is. Sorry Campbell's go back to the test kitchen and try again.
