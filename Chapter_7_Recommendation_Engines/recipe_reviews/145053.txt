Sensational! This recipe rocks!
I got some help from a friend that says you can never stop stirring. I don't need to go to health club because my arms are so toned now. Used Artichoke hearts instead of hearts of palm.

The end product was outstanding despite not having the perfect ingredients or being able to follow the directions exactly. Used long grain white rice(one less cup of water and chicken base), no broth, and put the palm in with the onions(oops!). served with chicken and asparagus stir fry.

My toddlers loved it! I replaced, of course, the wine with more broth, and the broth was very light to avoid salt. A good way of making them eat hearts of palm, something unusual, and help them open up to a new taste.

We were looking for a way to jazz up rice as a side-dish and this did the trick! Out of necessity we used regular white rice (worked great), Sake for the white wine (it was all we had), added half of a can mushrooms (they added color and an extra layer of consistency), and omitted the cheese (just didn't have any). Even without the cheese, it was very thick and flavorful. Also followed another user's advice and stirred [almost] constantly. Thanks for the great recipe, this will definitely be a regular.

This is a tasty recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie and substituted mushrooms for the hearts of palm.  Your instructions do not state when to add the cheese.  I assume at the end as with most risottos.

This was a wonderful recipe!  My daughter, who does not care for hearts of palm, loved it as well. The Parmesan gives it a nice cheesieness.  I was out of white wine so skipped that, but added a half cup of frozen baby peas. With the peas added it's a 5 star!

I made this for a Christmas holiday dinner and it was fabulous!  I scaled it to 6 servings and it worked fine.
Only change I made:  I added about a cup of baby portabellos to the onion and sauteed them together.
Will definitely serve this again --- my next dinner party will be a hit with this on the side!

I found this while doing a search for risotto.  I spent a month in Brazil several years ago visiting a cousin I had never met.  I fell in love with this country and its food and I miss it very much.  I am definitely going to have to try this.  Obrigato, Patricia (hope I said that right.)

This was very good but I think that it needed something else.     I made this with mini bow tie pasta rather than risotto & red wine instead of white.  I used about half the butter, oil, cheese & vegetable broth. Though, it still came out with a hearty flavor.   The hearts of palm were not the star of this dish so next time I would like to add a variety of mushrooms / vegetables.    What I liked most about this recipe was the methodology of this recipe.  I likes that the grain was cooked in the broth & wine because it made my pasta very flavorful.

I'm on a diet so I lightened it up a bit. I have made risotto many times so was sure cutting out some of the butter/oil wouldn't change it too much. I reduced the olive oil to one tsp, using this to saute the onion. I followed as directed except substituting Chicken for Vegetable Broth and using more broth instead of wine. I had a can of Hearts of Palm - used the entire thing diced fine (this may be too much for some but I love the taste!) Finally, topped with reduced fat Italian blend cheese. Delish - and it doesn't taste low fat!!

Outstanding risotto. I paired this up with Stuffed Chicken Valentino from the site and my wife and one year old didn't leave a speck of rice on the plate. Also, it would help if the Parmesan was added to the instructions because not everyone knows how to make a traditional risotto. And for the record, do yourself justice and use fresh grated parmesan.

LOVE this risotto!  It was a big hit with my family. I was in a hurry and didn't follow the instructions at the beginning of the recipe, toasting the rice. I also used a couple teaspoons of minced garlic in place of the onion.  As long as you stir in the liquid slowly, this is foolproof.

This was SO good!  I used a non stick pan so that I didn't have to stir constantly.  I stirred once every 2 minutes or so.  I also added sliced portabella mushrooms when I added the hearts of palm.  This was my first attempt at risotto - I will be making this recipe again!!!!

Considering I made this with instant brown rice, didn't have vegetable stock or onions and substituted with onion soup mix (whoa saltiness!), and added mushrooms and sweet peas, I'm giving it 5 stars because it's pretty hard to mess up.

I thought is recipe was good and fairly easy and could be made with ingredients I usually have.  I used regular rice, used extra broth in place of wine, and skipped the parsley.  There is stirring involved, so plan for that or have an assistant.  Next time I will try to get all the ingredients.  I bet it would be even better.

Great flavor!  I used pecorino romano instead of parmesan to give it a bit more flavor. Will try adding sauteeed crimini mushrooms next time.

Go ahead and just plan from the start to make a double batch of this because A) you will want it all and B) this recipe doesn't make a very large batch as it stands. I would recommend going liberal on the herbage and pepper to make it extra good.

This was an easy recipe.  I used Better than Bouillon Concentrated Vegetable Base and I think I used too much bc it was a little salty.  Other than that, we really enjoyed it.

Really good!  First time I had Palm hearts and they are delicious.  I didn't have dry white wine. Substituted a suggestion of  30 ml white wine vinegar + 30 ml water. 

I also didn't have vegetable broth, so substituted with beef broth.  The beef broth I have is commercially prepared and was too salty ...so in the end, it tasted great. I can imagine with the dry white wine and a nice light vegetable broth this would be so much better.  I will try it again in the future. Maybe then I will take a picture.

Meh, this was good but not amazing like I’d hoped for. I might make it again, but it’s not in the definite pile. Also not sure how the recipe picture turned out so white, mine was more golden brown.??

Great recipe. I've also made it with spinach instead of hearts of palm and it came out good. I'm about to make it with broccoli since that's what my mom is craving

Delicious! All of my guests enjoyed it and couldn't wait for seconds. I added peas (like the description mentions) but otherwise followed the recipe.

Excellent recipe, not that hard to make. It has a very pleasant and delicate taste. Besides the Parmesan cheese, I also added some Gorgonzola cheese.
