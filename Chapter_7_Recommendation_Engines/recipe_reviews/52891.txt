Yummy if you like chocolate & mint with a slight coffee flavor.  We bought ingredients in bulk (we used decaf Taster's Choice) and made batches of this last Christmas (2002) to bottle and give as gifts.  We filled pint or larger mason jars and covered the lid with seasonal fabric.  We changed the name to "Santa's Minty Mocha" and made stick on labels on the computer listing the instructions to make one cup.  We tied gift tags on with festive ribbon.  A great hit!

I accidentally added 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of the smaller amount called for in the recipe but it is great that way.  This will be good over crushed ice or blended as a frosty drink in the blender also.

Yummy. This is great because you can control the level of sweetness. I just wanted to make 2 cups and I didn't have instant coffee so I brewed some and added hot cocoa mix, milk and peppermint and heated on the stove. I will definitely make this again.

I scaled this down to one serving and
I made it grownup with peppermint schnapps. I also stirred it up with a candy cane (from last year, but who cares). Tasty!
