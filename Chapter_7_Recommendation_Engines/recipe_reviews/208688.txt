This was fantastic! I have tried chimichurri sauce a couple of times and did not like the oily texture.  The avacado provides a creamy texture and a rich flavor that works well with the rest of the ingredients. I added lime juice and used red wine vinegar - would definitely make again!

Mmmm this was really cool!  The ingredient list seemed kind of flexible, so I used red wine vinegar for the cider and cilantro and red onion as the spices.  (In addition to the garlic, salt and jalapeno pepper as called for.)  It was kind of like a guacamole with a kick...really tasty w/ taco chips and spread on a turkey & tomato sandwich.  Thanks!

This was very good! I used italian flat leaf parsley. I served this on top of 'Cucumber Sandwich' recipe from this site. The flavors of this were very fresh and wonderful. I can't wait to try this on fish! Thanks for sharing. :)
