This is SO, so good and amazingly, quite easy and idiot-proof. Just heaven. I love that it calls for fresh produce. Our local farmers markets really have the best produce which really takes your typical tomato soup over the top. I used organic tomato sauce and FF half-n-half. Wonderful. This is low in calories and high vitamins so I didn't feel guilty going back for a little more. This one's a keeper. NOTE: Next time, I'd like to add some fresh basil to really drive me crazy.

Of course I have to give this recipe five stars - it's my own! Funny enough, I had forgotten about it until I did a tomato soup search and it popped up as an option! Remember - use homegrown or farmer's market fresh tomatoes for the best taste. Second choice is homegrown tomatoes that you canned back in the summertime. Do not use hard, yucky grocery store winter tomatoes and expect this to turn out well.

This is no typical tomato soup and explodes with flavour with I tried it the first time. My husband suggested adding small meatballs - a great addition for meat-lovers :)

Delicious!  I didn't have carrots, so I made it without....it is super easy and so so good.  The coffee adds a depth of flavor and smokey delight.  I added basil and extra salt to mine.  Try it!

What a flavorful soup! Also fast and easy to make.  I pureed it in our VitaMix all in one batch, no problems. We used freshly picked garden tomatoes and flat-leaf parsley from my herb garden.    The coffee gave it a smokey flavor.  My husband actually asked, "did you smoke these tomatoes first or something?"! The only thing I substituted was canned condensed milk for the heavy cream.    The heavy cream probably would have been a more delicate flavor, but I learned the condensed milk trick last year, it's cheaper, I always have it around the house, and then the rest of the cream doesn't go bad because I rarely use it, plus it's lower in fat for my family and for recipes like this where it's just a little bit, it doesn't make a huge difference.

Super easy!  Even my husband, who doesn't usually like tomato soup, said it was tasty.  The only things I changed were: 1) I left out the carrots, as I didn't have any on hand; and 2) I used a 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup garlic cooking cream cheese instead of heavy cream.  It was wonderful!

My husband said this should be called "Robust Garden Tomato Soup". It was very good, (we ate the whole pot!) but it just wasn't what we expected. We loved the fresh tomato taste, so I will make again and tweak it so its not so "garden" like and maybe reduce the amount of coffee. I used 3/4 cup Double Black Diamond coffee from Green Mountain and I think it was just too strong.

This is the best tomato soup recipe!  I've made it several times now and figured I better get on here and give it a good review so others will try it. I can't wait to try it this summer with fresh tomatoes from my garden, but being that I found the recipe n winter, I've been using quality canned tomatoes and it still is a tremendous recipe!  Not to mention a great way to sneak in veggies with the kiddos.  What kid can say no to grilled cheese and tomato soup? :) My favorite part is the texture.  It reminds me a lot of LaMadeleine's tomato basil bisque without the basil.  Maybe I will do what another reviewer said and try it with basil added next time. Thank you LAGIRL for a fabulous recipe!

If I could give 6 stars I would! Made this recipe almost exact, didn't have tomato sauce so I used a small can of tomato paste, and due to a whole 30 diet my husband and I are on (we can't have added sugars or dairy) I left out the sugar and cream. But our homegrown tomatoes are sooooo sweet so it was still a sweet soup! My husband was hungry and impatient so I didn't blend the soup, we ate it like a chunky veggie soup...it was amazing. Make this recipe, you won't be disappointed! 
p.s. don't be afraid of the coffee ingredient!!!! it is the definitely the 'secret ingredient' of this soup!!!!!

I loved this soup, and so did the family. When I came across it I thought of the partial pot of coffee on the counter, the garden tomatoes and herb plot in the backyard, and I also liked the way the recipe "sneaks" in extra veggies. It was simple, and simply delicious! Thank you!

This was my first time making tomato soup from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I liked it but it was missing something, not sure what. I am now going to try other tomato soup recipes and see how they rate to this one.

My husband made this for dinner one night and I've been joyfully eating the leftovers for a couple of days now. Seriously, so delicious! We even made it without the cream and it was still fabulous, so it can work for those who need to go dairy free!

Simply good.  A great way to use veg from the garden!  I would double or triple this next time as the four of us polished it off for dinner tonight.  Leftovers would be welcome. (I did add basil - yum!)

This has been my go-to tomato soup for a couple of years now, but I've never taken the time to review it.  If the tomatoes are really sweet and summer ripe, I sometimes add a tiny shot of red wine vinegar to round out the flavors.  Now, if I ever have to eat tomato soup of out of a can (horrors!), I always add a shot of strong coffee to it.

This was good, but sould be better. The cooking time was too short to really soften the vegetables, which would have made a better texture. The flavour was good, but not outstanding. Perhaps some more herbs, basil, for instance and maybe oregano too, would provide a more complex flavour. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this soup. Had to make changes for my dietary restrictions. I know everyone is saying how great the coffee was but I don't drink coffee so I left it out. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream and added coconut milk instead of sugar and about a cup of vegetable broth. It was great!

01-14-16 ~ A different twist on tomato soup.  I doubled this and made it for a birthday carry-in at work and it was a big hit.  I had fresh garden tomatoes, that I froze and used those in this recipe.  I didn't measure the onions, carrots and celery, but know I had more than enough of the fresh veggies added.  The coffee was the ingredient that I was most worried about, as I am not a coffee drinker and neither are most of my co-workers.  It worked great in this recipe and you couldn't detect the flavor.  All the ingredients work really well together in this soup.  I used my immersion blender stick rather then dirty the big blender to puree the soup.  Plus I wanted a few small chunks left in the soup.  A nice recipe that I would make again.

Was looking for something different to make at my Coffee Shop for our daily soup, so I gave this a try. It was a huge hit, sold out within hours. Only thing I did differently was listen to the reviews here and added a little Basil. Great soup, thank you.

Coffee in a soup? Wow! It adds a flavor component that I could not get with herbs and spices alone. I try various soup recipes regularly and this one is a winner. I added some left over spaghetti sauce with hamburger which gave it added texture. I went easy on the heavy cream.
