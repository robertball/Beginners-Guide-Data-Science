What a lovely recipe!  I was too lazy to make the traditional "bear claw" shape- I just made ravioli-looking things- but they were beautiful to look at anyway and tasty. I went heavy on the almond flavor, as is my preference, and I thought they were 'bakery worthy'.  Great recipe!

The use of store bought puff pastry made this recipe so easy ! The filling tasted  very good too, though I used almond flour for ground almonds and 1 whole egg for the 2 yolks. I think the puff pastry brand I used has smaller pastry sheets so I was only  able to  make 8 small bear claws, and had about half the filling left. I stored in the fridge and plan to use soon. And, heads up,  the sliced almond browned too much during baking..
