This was so good and so easy to make!  I used a frozen bag of veggies and it tasted great!  Just cooked the veggies a little bit before I added the other ingredients.  This is definitely something I will make again because it was so easy on my budget and everyone enjoyed it!  The crunch of the vegetables goes great with the pasta and sauce.  I even used a stir-fry mix b/c the grocery store was out of anything else-still great!

My daughter & I loved it. Thanks for the idea even though I changed a couple of things. I don't like canned chicken, so I cut-up 2 boneless breast into small cubes. I also used veggie rotini noodles (cooked in chicken broth). my veggies were broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, red & green bell peppers.  Its delicious!

This is a great base receipe for an easy dinner. I ended up boiling pre-filled fresh ravioli in another pan while I sauteed the vegetables, added the soup and the milk and then when it had thickened, added the cooked pasta. I topped it with cheese. The filled pasta certainly added more flavor but the sauce was just fine on its own. I used fresh vegetables and it didn't take too long for them to cook.

It looked and tasted a little boring so I ended up adding a can of broccoli cheese soup, a little more milk and i put it in a casserole dish, covered it in shredded cheese and italian style bread crumbs and put it in the oven for about 10 minutes just to melt the cheese. It was quick and pretty good with some improvements :)

Though it was easy to make, it was rather bland. I wouldn't make this recipe again.
