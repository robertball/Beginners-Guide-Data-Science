Simple and delicious!  I like the addition of the banana. They balance out the tartness from the pineapple and mango.  I'm not normally a huge fan of papaya, but it's very good mixed with the other fruits. I think next time I might sprinkle some coconut over the top. Great recipe!
Edited to add: I would recommend eating this the same day. It tends to get mushy when stored for more than a day.
