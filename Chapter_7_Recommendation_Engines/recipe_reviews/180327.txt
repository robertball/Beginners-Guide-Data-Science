This recipe does sound a bit odd but I gave it a try and everyone loved it!  I added some leftover corn casserole and it was delicious.

This was great. Such a nice change from the casseroles and enchiladas that we usually make. Hubby loved them. Very fussy daughter had seconds. Thanks for sharing. Awesome!

I wanted to find a recipe that used turkey but was different from the stews, soups and pot pies. This was the perfect recipe. I used canneloni pasta instead of the large shells (b/c that is what I had on hand). Works well :) The hubby LOVED it!!

Made this for the first time last night and they were soooooo good......The recipe was easy to follow. Plus it gave me a chance to use my Kitchen Aid stand mixer that I got for Christmas.... I think that next time I will try this with chicken instead of turkey.

I was looking for something not so traditional to do with my leftovers and this dish sounded interesting. The reviews were what got me interested. I didn't have jumbo shells, so I used large manicoti shells instead. Everyone except my youngest son loved them, but he doesn't like cheese. I didn't blend the stuffing and turkey. I chopped the turkey and mixed by hand to give a bit more texture. Glad I did since each bite had a slightly different flavor. I will definitely make again!

Made this for a "Leftover Party" I went to.  It was a huge hit!!  Great way to reinvent turkey and stuffing.  The texture is a bit strange but it tastes good!

Made this last night and was really, really good!  Was surprised the husband loved it cuz he's used to the beef stuffed shells his mom makes...I used Stove Top stuffing for turkey - anyway, weird ingredients for shells but GREAT!

This was fantastic!  A few of the other reviews said it was bland, but that will of course be the case if you start out with bland tasting turkey, stuffing, and gravy.  If you start out with really good tasting thanksgiving leftovers, this dish will turn out good tasting too. I used the recipe as a "guideline" and basically threw in what I had, which was 1-1/2 of turkey, about 2 cups of dressing, and only a cup of gravy.  I didn't have any parmasan cheese, but I did have "Italian Blend" cheese, so I used that instead of mozzarella.  It was truly wonderful!

This was a hit with family and coworkers.  We used the boxed stuffing (Leftovers are too precious to put in a casserole:-) and a jar of gravy (this years gravy as a bit of a fiasco:-/)  Even with the less than homemade ingredients this was still a very tasty, easy to make dish.

I have been making this for four years now. It is very good and something family looks forward to the day after Thanksgiving. I started using Manicotti instead of shells. Just easier to fill. You wont be sorry that you tried this.

Great way to use up three Thanksgiving leftovers.  My gravy was pretty thick, and I would suggest thinning it out with leftover chicken stock or milk.  Also, I added a few pieces of leftover sliced cheese cut into thin strips.

Made this again after Christmas and it's still a hit.  Used stove top stuffing and a package of gravy mix because I didn't have enough leftovers of either.  Also used cannelloni shells and as another reviewer suggested, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the base, and added a bit into the gravy on top.  You can't even tell it's there!  It was really good, everyone liked it a lot.  It got better reviews than the enchiladas I made!

Great change from my usual leftover Thanksgiving meals. Had some leftover shells like everyone else. I managed to stuff 30. Also keep in mind that this dish is only as good as the leftovers so those who thought it was bland probably had a bland Thanksgiving too. Mine was delicious!!!

I simplified the recipe by using cooked macaroni and then I mixed it with the  mixture of cheeses and turkey. Of course it was dry so I added milk to get the right consistency. I put the entire mixture into a casserole dish, topped with the last 2 cups of mozzarella  cheese and baked.

It had a wonderful flavour and this way you can use whatever pasta you have on hand. No need to buy and stuff shells.

Would not recommend blending all the ingredients.  It came out much like turkey dinner flavored baby food.  I will make this again, but I will mix it without the blender step.  Flavor was good.

Instead of adding cream cheese, I used leftover homemade creamed corn that was made with cream cheese. I made no other changes. The whole family loved this.  It sounds like a bizarre casserole but everything works together great. NO leftovers--we ate the whole thing.

We really liked this recipe.  I did have to substitute cream of chicken for the gravy (no gravy on hand) and used some instant stuffing (cornbread stuffing made with chicken broth), but otherwise followed the directions.  It was easy to make and tasted great!

This was pretty good. Excellent way to get rid of left overs. I used a 8oz of cream cheese. It was a little bland...Could have used maybe onion and some extra spices. I will probably make this again after Thanksgiving next year.

This recipe is very good. I have been looking for new things to try and this certainly delivered! I used rigatoni shells, chicken and cream of chicken soup since I couldn't wait for the holiday season. Definately one I will be making again!

Was looking for something different to do with the leftovers...this hit the mark.  Who ever came up with this is a genius!  I halved the amount of mozzarella, putting one cup in the filling and using the other cup for the top.  Upped the gravy a bit.  It was awesome.  Next time, I'm going to add some leftover cranberry sauce to the filling, as we like slightly sweet/savory.  This freezes very well too!  I made extra for those nights I don't want to cook!  Thanks for sharing this!

If not for the reviews I wouldn't have made this because it sounds gross to me.  It was a great way to use up the leftovers, my brother hand seconds and my Dad raved about it.  I added extra poultry seasoning because my stuffing was really bland this year.  It is the perfect amount of filling for the shells but I couldn't get them all to fit in the suggested pan so I'm freezing the extra for another time.

This was great! We went out for Thanksgiving, but my family liked this idea so much that we bought the supplies to make it on Friday anyways, even if it wasn't made of leftovers. Our only qualm with the recipe was that there wasn't enough gravy. I followed the directions to a T, but the shells that didn't get as much gravy became hard and chewy in places. Great recipe, but I'd go up a cup or so on the amount of gravy.

What's not to love about this recipe! Ok I didn't have shells so I used 12oz of elbows, so i made a layered pasta/turkey casserole. Cooked elbows and divided in 2, also I didn't processed everything in the blender. I chopped everything and mixed with a spoon. Layered gravy, pasta, turkey stuffing cheese mix, pasta, gravy, cheese. It was a great meal after snowshoeing! My son even went back for second instead of cookies for evening snack.... :) I do think tho that it's only as good as your original gravy and stuffing were.

For those reviews that said they were bland, their original ingredients were probably bland. We had excellent Thanksgiving dinner, all home-made from scratch. I usually make Thanksgiving leftover enchiladas, but we tried this last year instead. PHENOMENAL!

Its very good, very tasty, but a little over powering, strong taste. All good ingredients  easy to make but you can only eat a couple at one sitting.

Yes it does sound weird, however, I found it to be insanely good.  It's not your Grandma's leftovers.

I've made this several seasons in a row with leftover turkey once folks are tired of sandwiches. I've even used sour cream instead of cream cheese and it's just as good.

The great reviews encouraged me to try this. To be honest, the family and I were underwhelmed - it was bland tasting; had a mushy, unpleasant texture; and was too salty. Unlikely to try it again, but if I did, I would omit the parmesan cheese ( too salty); rough chop and hand mix the stuffing and turkey to give it some texture; and kick it up with some garlic, red pepper and fried onions. I would also pass on the gravy and use a white sauce, maybe a cream soup undiluted.

Very good recipe and a great idea to use up leftovers.  I had made champagne basted turkey, and the leftover juices made a great gravy for this recipe.  I boiled the whole box of shells, but ended up with about 6 leftover.

Other commenters suggested not to use a food processor -- I agree.   Just chop and don't over mix for a nice texture. Leftover gravy?!!  Never at my house.  If you need to use gravy in a jar, be sure and add spices to it to insure great flavor.  This was delicious.     Maybe it's just me, but it always takes me a lot longer to prep any recipe than it says it should.

There are several recipes on here that are nonsense to see if baffoons will make them or even better leave a good review. Makes me laugh every time. I have given this one 3 stars for the sheer ridiculousness of it and that over 60 people fell for it. good job.

Like others I was skeptical but I was wanted to try something different. We were pleasantly surprised on how good this turned out. Like others I didn't process the turkey and stuffing just mixed them right in. I also cut back on the mozzarella to one cup at the end. The dish was hearty and delious.

OMG!!! This was awesome!  I didn't have enough gravy, so I used the little bit of gravy I had on the bottom of the pan and Cream of Mushroom soup on top.  It would have been even more awesome with all gravy!  Definitely keeping this for all future holiday leftovers.

Loved it!  My only change would be a little less cheese (maybe 2c total mozzarella, instead of 4).  It was very cheesy & good!

This turned out delicious! I made as exact but added my leftover mashed potatoes as well probably about a cup worth and it was great. My family loved it and they're not crazy about turkey especially after so many leftover nights...it was just hidden enough. Thanks for sharing idea it was a hit!

Followed the recipe exactly as written. I really didn't like it, my husband said it was okay. Very bland, probably would have been better if I made a turkey manicotti with the shells, using ricotta cheese and omitting the stuffing. I just really didn't care for this, won't even tweek it to make it better, sorry for the bad review, just my opinion.

I love the thought of casseroles.  But my family isn't big on them.  So when I decided to make this one I figured it would be another "just okay" casserole.  Whoa, was I surprised.  This is AWESOME!  I didn't have Jumbo Shells so I made it with manicotti. I just used my handheld food chopper to chop up the turkey and dressing. Then tossed it into my stand mixer.  Next my husband had the brilliant idea of putting the mixture into a sandwich bag and snipping off the corner, making filling the pasta super easy!  It wAS FABULOUS!  I like bread dressing for Thanksgiving so that's what we had today for this recipe.  I can't wait to try this again with cornbread dressing...I bet it is great as well.  My husband says we should try it again when we roast a chicken. Thanks so very much Abbeydave for something different to make with all those leftovers!!!

This was a big hit with the fam, even though I was "iffy" about it even as I prepared it. I used manicotti instead of shells since I had that on hand. This will definitely be part of our future after-holiday meals.

CRAZY!!  I mean really, who would have ever thought.  I made this last night w/much trepidation!  The thought of it just did not sit right w/me.  I mean, stuffed shells are not made with turkey people!  But I trusted the reviews and went for it.  All of us loved it! We had wonderful (if I may say so myself..lol)leftovers from Thanksgiving and this dish was great.  We have a full Italian living with us so I was very nervous about serving this dish and he loved it.  Really great idea!  Thanks

I didn't have a stand mixer or paddle attachment so I had to mix everything by hand and it was slightly difficult.  Next time I will wait for the cream cheese to soften a bit.  I also used mild cheddar instead of mozzarella and 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup (1/2 cup on the bottom & the rest on top) as we really like sauce in this house.  Some corn would have gone a long way in adding flavor, but over all this was a really good leftover recipe!

Awesome recipe!  I have 3 children (ages 6, 8 & 9) and all three loved this, as did my husband and myself.  Very easy to make as I had my 9yr old help me mix it together.  This is definitely the ultimate leftovers dish!

These were so good!  My kids (9 & 6) who wouldn't normally eat stuffing ate every bit of the casserole. Definitely a keeper.

I decided to make this for dinner after reading the reviews.  It was delicious and will definitely become a keeper in my recipe box.  I think a little more gravy will make it an even better recipe.
