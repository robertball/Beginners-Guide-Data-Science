This was really great, and it was exactly what I had been craving.  Here are my adjustments: I used skim milk instead of cream (what I had on hand, & wanted to keep fat down), crushed red pepper instead of cayenne (what I had on hand), and added a sprinkle of dried ground ginger.  It had just the right amount of bite to tease the palate but certainly would not be classified as spicy.  Would definitely make this again.

This soup is AWESOME and was so creamy! I just boiled the sweet potatoes in the chicken broth (I used much less than recipe called for... bout 36oz), with some chopped onion and then used an emulsifier while adding the other ingredients. Plus, used smart balance 1% milk instead of cream and it worked great and is much healthier! I'm definitely making this again and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes sweet potatoes! :-D

This soup was surprisingly wonderful.  I made it for my family - the men in my family loved it!  It's very filling, though, so a little goes a long way.  Don't get overzealous with the servings.  I made a simple green salad with dried cranberries, blue cheese crumbles and honey balsamic vinniagrette to go along with the meal, and served pita chips with the soup.  Wonderful meal!

This was SOOO delicious! If I wasn't such a well mannered person I would have licked the bowl! My whole family liked it, too. I did make one alteration. I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream.

I had a hard time with this soup.  I liked it and I didn't like it, how about that for wishy washy!  The soup was exactly what it was supposed to be, but I didn't love the sweetness of the sweet potato in the soup.  "What exactly were you expecting", you ask?  "When you make sweet potato soup", you say, "it is supposed to taste like sweet potatoes".  Okay, so it doesn't make sense, but I still didn't love it.  The soup had a nice texture and good sweet flavor, but for me to really like it, it would have needed to get a little more savory.  The addition of sauteed onion or more chicken flavor might have saved it for me, or maybe adding one regular potato to mellow it out, but it was just too "sweet potatoey".  I think I will stick to less assertive vegetables for my soups, like butternut squash.

My husband was going to open a can of soup because he did not think he would like this.  I made him have a taste with a slice of homemade beer bread from this site, he put the can away and got himself a bowl.  Very yummy.  I used half and half instead of cream and I could not find my nutmeg so I used ginger, oh, and i only used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 3 cans.  thank you for a great recipe!

This is the best!  It's simple to make; it can be made the day before and refrigerated and it is absolutely delicious.  My guests loved it.  I used 5% cream and even tried skim milk.  It would delicous both ways.

Delicious and easy to make!  I just made it tonight-- Used Vegetable broth instead of chicken, but otherwise used the same recipe.

Thank you-- I'll be sure to make it a few more times this winter.

This is an excellent, easy "go to" soup recipe!  I've made it about 10 times now, and it's always excellent.   I have made a few changes on occasion:  I leave out the cayenne (I never buy it, don't care for it).  Sometimes I use veggie broth instead of chicken, depending on what i have on hand.  Last time I added a bit of apple cider and it was also delicious.  Once in a while I change up the spices - I might add a bit of ginger and cinnamon, or even some curry.  As is or with any of those little changes, it always turns out great. Thanks!

Great recipe and quick too!  Baking the sweet potatoes adds a nice richness and you could get away with no cream or milk  at all for a no fat soup. I added 1/2 tsp cumin and used half and half instead of heavy cream because that is what I had on hand.  A stick blender makes quick work of blending this soup.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it! I'll make this often I'm sure.

Made this but instead of heavy cream I added an 8oz square of cream cheese. I skipped the cayenne pepper due to sensitive stomachs in this house. I also added fresh grated nutmeg and cinnamon. I have to say this is the best soup I've made in a very long time.

What a good way to eat more sweet potatoes! I used red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne pepper and it worked out fine. Next time I would try 2% milk instead of the cream. This is super filling - I just had some and now I kind of want to take a nap under my desk.

This soup is delicious and so easy to prepare!!! I did make a few changes though. First I didn't add the sugar, salt, nutmeg or cayenne. Instead I added Club House Indian Masala. OMG!! It turned the soup into a creamy curry sweet potato soup. Sweet potato and curry are just made for each other. My husband and kids loved it! Thanks for the great idea. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

Awesome soup and so easy to prepare.  My husband and I loved it.  I didn't add the brown sugar and it was still sweet enough, and I used 1% milk in lieu of the cream.  This reminds me of another soup that I prepare on a weekly basis - carrot soup.  My husband can't get enough of it....

As usual I used the recipe as a starting point and was pretty pleased with the results.  Instead of putting potatoes in the oven I peeled and cut mine (only 2 of them) added an onion, wrapped them in foil and baked at 400 degrees for about 40 min till everything was soft.  I used about half the broth, pureed the pototoes and onions put the puree on the stove to simmer and added a cup of coconut milk (I had some on hand that I needed to use up.) After tasting the mixture I added a pinch of brown sugar, the nutmeg, a pinch of ginger and a pinch of ground cloves.  It tastes pretty good.  The coconut milk adds A LOT.  I can't imagine what the soup would taste like without it! Have fun with this one!  You can do just about anything you want... (within reason)

:)

Super easy, amazingly elegant.  I microwaved the sweet potatoes.  I am glad I did not include the sugar.  The little touch of cayenne gave it an intriguing touch without making it overtly spicy.  I will definitely make this again as directed, but I want to experiment with ginger and curry, too.

Our daughter made this soup for dinner tonight because all of us love sweet potatoes, they are packed with vitamins and it was a good "soup night" -- cold and snowy.  It was absolutely delicious!  She even substituted skim evaporated milk for the heavy cream (to make it healthier and less fatty) and it was still great!  So quick and easy, too, because she simply cooked the potatoes in the microwave.  Will definitely have this soup again soon!

I love this recipe! I've made my own slight tweak of it, just for the sake of using less dishes. I cut up and boil my sweet potatoes in the chicken stock. Then I add my spices/brown sugar, mix those in using a wooden spoon so that the sweet potatoes start to mash. Then I refrigerate it till dinner time. Then I puree the whole thing with my blender before reheating the potato mixture and finally adding the cream at the end. My husband adores this recipe as well, and we love eating it with a bit of toasted brioche on the side.

What did I think of this?  I think that it's awesome! Since becoming a widower, as much as I used to enjoy cooking up nice dinners for the two of us, cooking for one most nights became almost a bit of a necessity rather that a pleasure. So I just look for easy, relatively quick and at least somewhat healthy things to whip up- and this fits the bill to a T.
As one person suggested, I just cook up the sweet potatoes in the chicken both- much easier and still as tasty, and then follow the recipe from there. I've also started to add a good-sized shallot, diced up and simmered it for the last couple of minutes before blending it all together in the pot. Subbed dried red pepper flakes for the cayenne- personal preference only- and it all turns out wonderfully. Quick, easy, tasty. What else is there?
Thanks, Zoe!

It's nice to see healthy sweet potatoes as the main ingredient in a dish aside from just the Thanksgiving sides and this recipe fills the bill.  I made the following adjustments:  used 1/3 c FF evaporated milk instead of the cream, and added roasted pumpkin seeds as a garnish. Served with fresh pita chips. DELISH! Thanks for the recipe.

This is very good.  I made it a bit thicker, mostly because all I had was 32 oz of chicken stock available.  It is very good.  Things that I did slightly differently was just chicken stock instead of broth, red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper, and half-n-half instead of cream.  Very good.  I'll be adding this to my soup recipe file!  Thanks!

This is really good.  I made the following changes: I did this in my slow cooker: peel/cut up the sweet potatoes and put in the crock pot with broth/water, brown sugar, nutmeg and pepper.  Low for 6 hours.  Then use immersion blender to puree, add whole milk, and mix with immersion blender again. Enjoy!  Am going to try with apples instead of brown sugar - will post my modification if it turns out!

This was an awesome recipe, but due to the fact we have little time in our busy house, we made a short cut which turned out perfect. instead of baking the potatoes we peeled cut to small pieces and then put all ingredience except the cream in a big pot and let boil for 40 mins. then pureed till smooth with hand blender. Then stirred n cream and let sit for 10 mins and served. It saved us 1 hour of time and turned out perfectly. I will make it again the same way. everyone loved it.

This is delicious. I didn't have a way to puree so I just boiled and whisked/mashed. Next time, I might not use heavy cream, as it was a bit heavy. I served it hot because I didn't have time to cool it but the next day, it was delicious cool. I didn't have standalone nutmeg so I used an apple pie spice that made for some cool flavors.

I absolutely love this recipe! The only alteration I make is to use yams instead of actual sweet potatoes. (Contrary to popular belief, they ARE different!) Everyone I have made this for loves it, and I'm getting ready to make some right now to have for dinner!

Yummy! I made it with 1% milk instead of cream, and served it with small pieces of yellow cake (without frosting) as a dessert. Such a great option for healthier dessert!

DELICIOUS! Excellent use for sweet potatoes. The only thing I changed was swapping milk instead of cream and adding some garlic. SOOOOO GOOD! :D

I liked how easy the recipe is and that I could use things I had onhand to make it. I used leftover sweet potato casserole that I blended in the blender first. The recipe was very adaptable. I liked trying the mix-in of a lil peanut butter in my serving. I wish that I'd had the low-sodium broth to get rid of the salty after taste. I added a few cashews for a garnish. I'll try cinnamon or ginger for some extra spice next time.

If you like sweet potatoes this is the soup for you! It is amazing! We added about 1/8cup extra brown sugar and left out the pepper (not a fan) but didn't change anything else about it. I wanted more the second it was gone!

Very tasty!  I had sweet potato soup at a fancy restaurant and decided to try to make it at home.  This recipe came awful close to what I had at the restaurant.  I boiled the potatoes rather than baked them, and then used less chicken broth b/c I wanted a thicker soup. After that, I was happy with the consistency and taste, so didn't add dairy. It probably would have jazzed it up a bit, but I was already pleased with how it tasted! I also added some sliced almonds and dried cranberries on top of the soup. Delicious!

This has quickly become a family favorite. Super easy to make and tastes delicious even when cutting a few corners! (I boil them instead of baking them.) Also, we added shrimp and a pinch of ginger. YUM!!

I have to give this 5 stars!  I made as directed, and it was really tasty and satisfying.  My husband, who doesn't care at all for sweet potatoes, ate a whole bowl and said he'd eat it again. ...from a man who doesn't like sweet potatoes, that's saying something!  Thanks for sharing ZOEMC!  
I've made again today making adjustments for what I had on hand and my personal taste, and will post a customized version to share.  Hint, if you love garlic, I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic (among other things), to my custom version, and I love it! ;)

So delicious! I used half&half but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as is. I didn't like the cayenne so I might leave that out or just add one dash next time. . . Overall, very easy and healthy! Thanks!:)

Very good. Made as written using a little less nutmeg as I don't care for it to much and using 2% milk instead of cream. My boyfriend didn't like it.  Which is ok, because I could eat the whole pot!

This soup is delicious and quite easy to make.  For some reason mine turned out a bit lumpy though.  I don't know if this has to do with the fact that I boiled my potatoes first

I tried to re-create a soup I tried in a restaurant and this was good, but not over-the-top excellent.  I upped the amount of brown sugar and added a tablespoon of white sugar to sweeten it up since it was somewhat bland.  I used skim milk instead of cream.  My boyfriend really enjoyed this and wants me to make again.  Also, I microwaved my sweet potatoes to speed up the process.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving and it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and used a combo of sweet potatoes and yams.  I also used extra cayenne pepper and it had a nice hot spice to it.  Also, a hand blender works great because then there's no need to dirty the blender and create more mess.

I used 2 large sweet potatoes and microwaved them for 15 minutes to cut down on time, a 32 oz. box of chicken broth, and added 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger. I also added 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter. No cream needed! Total cooking time was less than 30 minutes. Delicious!! Will make again soon!

I liked this soup, it had a nice flavor and could be served with something more substantial - I don't know what though... My family loves sweet potatoes, but were NOT fans of this soup and would rate it much lower.

This was delicious. I used fat free sour cream instead of cream. Since it was such a small amount, you don't really taste the tang of the sour cream, but it made it nice and creamy.

Excellent and quick idea for supper and doesn't require much in the way of things to buy.  I just kept adding the spices until it tasted just right to me.  I will make this again.  No adjustments were necessary. Thanks Zoe.

I give it four stars because I was not crazy about it but my boyfriend loved it. If you don't LOVE the taste of sweet potatoes don't make this soup.

My whole family loves this. Easy to make also. I peel, cut in chunks, and steam the sweet potatoes for about 12 minutes. Saves on baking time and heating oven. Also omitted the cream for lower calorie and outcome was delightful! Great recipe!

I thought that this recipe was easy and good. I did however tweek it a little with things that I like.  I roasted a head of garlic with the potatoes and sauted some onions, and blended that with the sweet potatoes.  I did leave out the cream/milk I thought it was creamy enough. I also took the advice from other and added red pepper flakes instead, and very little brown suger.  Its a great easy recipe that you can add your own flare to!!!!

My husband said 5, I said 4, but I'll give it the benefit of the difference. He says it would go great with Thai food, I agree. It has a bit of a MILD curry taste, quite good!

As others,  found that I needed more sugar that the recipe called for.  A packet or two of Splenda did the trick.  I have finally realized that I do not like nutmeg, so I will be omitting that in the future.  Good, easy fall/winter recipe.

I made this according to the recipe except fot the brown sugar.  I used Splenda and added a heaping 1/4 cup.  It turned out to be a little on the sweet side for my taste, but my daughter thought it was the best soup she ever had!

It was good but I found that I had to add a lot of brown sugar to my taste - probably used 3/4 cup or more.  Also, add the chicken broth a little at a time - 32 oz. was more than enough broth for me.  I am not sure I would make it again since I felt it needed so much sugar.

Awesome soup. I had two sweet potatoes so I  scaled the recipe down accordingly . I made a roux with 1/4 cup butter and 3 tbsp flour. To that I added the spices and the pureed sweet potato/chicken stock mixture and simmered for about 5 minutes or so. I omited the cream because it tasted so good as is.  This would be a great for those who can't tolerate lactose!

Thank you for the recipe. I also added carmelized onions and roasted garlic pieces, which I had made to flavour olive oil for garlic bread, which accompanied the bowl of soup. The onions and garlic cooked down and added another layer of flavour to an already good recipe.

After reading reviews and comments. I added chopped onions and bell pepper, which I sauteed with butter prior to adding anything else to the pot.  Chopped the potatoes and cooked them in the broth, onions, and peppers. Added the seasonings and let it roll.

I made it with 4 small sweet potatoes and 2 small white potatoes, roasted in foil at 375 until soft, about 1 hour.  Fried some onion, garlic, fresh grated nutmeg. Added a few shakes of cumin and cayenne pepper, plus s&p.  I didn't add any sugar. All that in one pot, then covered with mushroom broth, then pureed. Added 1/2 can of coconut milk (AroyD brand),  brought that to the boil. Added some fresh thyme.  Yummy.

This was a good recipe. Made it with most of the ingredients, skipping the salt and sugar. I added a couple dashes of nutmeg, the black pepper, just a bit of ginger and the cayenne.  To streamline process, I peeled and cubed the potatoes and cooked them in the chicken broth. I have a stick blender so I didn't have to use a blender to puree it.

I doubled the recipe and added apple cider and a few diced apples for a nice mellow sweetness. I also added regular potatoes (didn't have enough sweet potatoes on hand) and while good, they mellowed the flavor so much that I did end up using the sugar when I had planned to leave it out. I started with onions, sauteed in oil, and added the potatoes right in the pot. After sauteing a while I added some broth and eventually the other ingredients. Loved the result, though it needed some tasting and seasoning when done. I also subbed half and half for the cream.

I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was a big hit.
I used lactose free cream  and used the blender to purée, plus we added bacon bits just before serving!  So easy and delicious.  The only change I may make next time is to halve the sugar. I don’t think it needs it.

This was a perfect way to use up some sweet potatoes I had mashed for a previous dinner and just made way too many and they were feeling a little bland. Loved how thick and creamy this came out and the flavor was awesome! Didn't have chicken broth on hand so I used chicken bullion and thought it tasted great. I didn't end up using the cayenne or nutmeg and just put maybe 2 tbsp of the brown sugar. Was the perfect mix of savory and a touch of sweet. It was a hit with my husband too who usually isn't all that excited by sweet potatoes. Will definitely make again!

I had home grown sweet potatoes that are sweet, so no sugar was added.  After reading some reviews, I chopped and browned half an onion in lite olive oil.  Added nutmeg, grated a Tablespoon or so of fresh ginger, then added veggie broth and a couple cloves of minced garlic. I added a dried New Mexican pepper Whole to the mix and removed it before serving. Almond milk added.  Quick and delicious.

Super easy recipe and very delicious! My son loved it and he doesn't even like yams! Only change I made was to just peel the yams and boil them in the chicken broth - it was much easier and faster than  baking them.

Nice hardy soup my husband loved it. So easy to make. I sautéed the sweet potatoes in olive oil and butter but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great

The only change I made was that I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, only because I didn't have any nutmeg! I also omitted the brown sugar.  It turned out well, thanks for the recipie.

This soup was bland, too sweet,  and smelled weird.  It calls for sweet potatoes, but I wonder if it means yams, because the picture is definitely  more orange-y than mine came out.  I made it with actual sweet potatoes (which are cream coloured), and ended up adding a bunch of curry just to make it edible. If it is supposed to be yams, I could see this probably being a bit better.  I wish people would use the proper names.

I made this soup for rmy family and they LOVED it!
I, too, substituted mik (1%) for the cream & I used a 900ml box of low sodium chicken broth..
The consistency of the soup was perfect - thick but not glooey.
I was generous with the cayenne pepper as we all love spice and the contraxt with the slightly sweet flavor was excellent.
We will make it again, certainly, and would not hesitate to serve it to guests.
If you like sweet potatotes, you will love this recipe!

After deciding the soup was much too sweet, I decided to change it up. Rather than cook the sweet potato before integrating the savoury ingredients, I peeled and chopped it up into chunks. I then sautéed garlic, onion, coriander, and green onions. I added the sweet potato, then the chicken broth and cooked it until it was soft enough to puree. I added the whole thing to a blender..made into a pure texture..took it back to the stove and added the rest of the spices (nutmeg, salt, pepper, and only 2 tablespoons of brown sugar). I let it simmer..added the cream and served.  Much better!!

This is my new favorite easy soup recipe.  It takes about 5 minutes to throw together, then I just pour from the blender to the slow cooker and put on low.  My mods were, added fresh ginger to the blender - about 1 tbsp.  Also used 1 tbsp molasses instead of the sugar.  Used veggie broth and no cream for a vegan soup.  Thanks for posting this!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was amazing!
Simple to make,I baked the potatoes for 8 minutes(turn the potato over halfway through the cooking time.) 
Both my boyfriend and I loved it,he asked me if I can make it once  a week :)

Absolutely love this recipe!!! Very easy and the taste is so good. Instead of baking the potatoes I boil them. I boil them until they get semi soft to the point I can peel off the outer layer very easily. If you are more into super sweetness, then use very little cayenne pepper.

Family loved it! I used 4 large sweet potatoes, a carton of chicken broth (28 oz), 3/4 cup half & half, about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and about 1/4 tsp of ginger. also used a little more brown sugar and nutmeg than recipe calls for as I made a larger amount.  It had a little "kick" which was perfect for me as I do not like spicy food and perfect for husband who does!

Followed the recipe with a few exceptions: (1) Microwaved the sweet potatoes, (2) used the blender, (3) substituted sour cream for heavy cream. We loved the spicy and sweet combo! Will make again.

Great recipe.  Just a little kick with the Cayenne but generally a sweet dish.  Used boiled and peeled sweet potatoes and sped the cooking time.

Great recipe! I doubled the nutmeg and also added a teaspoon of cinnamon, which added a nice kick to the end of every spoonful. To soften the potatoes, I just microwaved them together on one plate for about 10 minutes before pureeing.

This recipe was very easy and very good. I used vegetabke broth instead of chicken and soymilk instead of heavy cream, and it turned out really well. I am going to try this recipe while substituting other vegetables for the sweet potatoes.

This was great. I had my wisdom teeth removed and was going crazy with nothing to eat. I had a sweet potato so I made a smaller batch of this. Added some ginger and cloves in addition to the nutmeg. Yum. Still have a few more servings left!

My husband liked this soup, but I hated it.  If you are just crazy over sweet potatoes than this soup would probably taste good to you. I on the other hand like them but dont love them enough to enjoy this recipe.  I thought the recipe needed alot more sugar, and I didnt really like the flavor of cayenne w/ the sweetness of the potato and sugar.  Wont be making this again.

Very easy to make.  A lot of flavor.  I used my own chicken stock which gave it more flavor.  Next time I will skip the one or the other peppers.  You don't need both.  I like it spicey but others may not.

This soup was very easy to make, and very good though I did have to substitute 1 can of vegetable broth as I only had two chicken broths in the pantry.I feel this made no difference to the taste; I also warmed the broth before blending it in the food processor with the sweet potatoes. I brought the recipe to work the next day to share with co-workers.

what a simple yet very tasty soup. I was short on the sweet potatoes so I added one can(the small size)of cut sweet potatoes to the fresh ones and pureed them together. YUM!!!!

This was good!  I skipped the sugar and milk and still really enjoyed this soup.
