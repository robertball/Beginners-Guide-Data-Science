VERY easy to make! I made exactly as the recipe calls for as I don't like to review a recipe that's been changed up. To me it's not a fair rating of the recipe. If you've changed things, it's no longer that recipe.

I'm trying to eat healthier and my nutrition coach suggested trying sweet potatoes instead of rolls/bread for my carbs. I'm hooked now!! I personally don't care for sweet potatoes and wasn't looking for a recipe that calls for adding molasses or brown sugar or anything like that to it. I don't personally like this by itself, but I eat it with meat (chicken and steak) and enjoy eating a bite of it with the meat. It's actually addictive eating it that way in my opinion. It's still sweet because it's a sweet potato. But I really like the spices that are included with it, especially the garlic!

I made this for my family's Christmas dinner. At first, I thought the recipe was too heavy on the garlic, and I think I would use a tad less if I made this again, but my family ended up really liking it! Even my brother, who doesn't like mashed sweet potatoes, had two helpings, and says it was really good. Overall, 4/5 stars for this recipe! The spices really help jazz up these mashed potatoes and complement each other well.

This isn't a bad recipe, everyone in my family liked it  a lot in fact. My only issue with it is that  I followed the recipe exactly, and the sweet potatoes were rock had after having been simmered for the said 20 min. To fix it, I brought them back to a rapid boil and boiled for  ~40 minutes. They weren't bad, but I still found that they were a bit hard...maybe something wrong with the potatoes?

Flavor was spot on, I am not a fan of overtly sweet Sweet Potatoes.  If you have to add sugar to your vegetable to make them taste good, there is something wrong with the vegetable.  I would definitely allow them to drain completely before mashing them.  The only change I made was, I boiled them in some chicken bouillon.  Will make these again.

This will be my new "go to" for holiday dinners!  My family doesn't like sweet potatoes with marshmallows, etc. and this savory concoction was very well received.  I did mine in the crock pot which was easy, saved oven space and stayed warm.

Instead of the thyme and basil I used a little maple syrup and brown sugar. It came out really good.

I'm used to super sweet potato with extra butter and sugar etc this is a nice more robust traditional dish to me. I made 500g worth and am going to eat it all by myself since I am perma bulking for weight training. about 650 calories with the potato and butter etc. good carb source

This will become my go to recipe for mashed sweet potatoes. I didn't have the herbs, so I added some maple syrup instead. Yummy!
