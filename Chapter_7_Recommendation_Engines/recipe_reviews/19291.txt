This is an excellent supper for week nights.  The only modification I made was to use fresh spinach versus frozen and added it to my colander prior to  draining my pasta so that it cooked it slightly.  This is a keeper.

In response to the previous poster who asked how the sausage should be prepared: my recommendation is to remove the casing- especially if you're serving it to kids. If you don't remove the casing, it could roll back while cooking the sausage pieces and you'll get the inevitable question from your kids, "What's this?" then "What's it made out of?" then "Ewww!" Best bet: use frozen sausages, thaw very lightly in the microwave, then use a sharp knife to cut membrane and remove.

This is my family's new favorite recipe! They request it all the time! I make it a little healthier using whole wheat pasta, low-sodium chicken broth, and spicy Italian turkey sausage. We actually like the turkey sausage better than regular sausage.

Absolutely wonderful recipe, quite elegant, extremely easy (I'm a novice) -- and restaurant quality taste! I used mild bulk sausage (did not add oil) and penne pasta.  Not draining the sausage made me nervous, but the end result was light and extremely good.  Even my teenage boys loved it, spinach and all!  All I can say is, thank you for submitting this one.  It is a keeper!

4 stars with the changes I made. I added red wine (1/2-1 cup and reduced it longer) then added heavy whipping cream until thick and creamy. I threw in canned asparagus tips and fresh spinach. Great meal!!

Wow, this was VERY good! I used a pint of fresh tomatoes versus canned and I used fresh spinach versus frozen. I think this did make a big difference in the over all taste but this recipe still gets 5 stars all the way. I also tried this with and without Parm Cheese and I can't believe as a major cheese lover that I am even typing this (putting hand over mouth) but I felt it was better with out the parmesan.

This is a great light pasta. With thin sauces like this, there are two things you can do to ensure the sauce still sticks to the pasta. First, fusilli is probably best to use with this (corkscrew shaped pasta). Second, don't cook your pasta first and then start on the sausage/veggie mixture. Do a little backwards planning, and after draining the water, don't waste any time with the pasta and get it mixed in with the sausage mixture. The pasta will be covered in starchy goodness that will help the sauce stick. I served this with some Focaccia bread that I also got from this site. Also, I suggest using fresh basil towards the end after the spinach is added. Dried basil simply doesn't do the fresh herb justice.

Unfortunately we weren't too impressed with this recipe.  The sauce didn't reduce that much so the whole dish was soupy.  All the flavors were great but we needed a bowl to eat it.  Next time I won't add the juice from the tomatoes and cut back a bit on the broth.

We found it 'salt-less' and that it needed some salt.  1/2 tsp should be fine.  All I can say is know your sausage and make sure it's hot, or this dish will lack the zippy flavour that it could have.

I just made this recipe. It's still simmering on the stove as I "speak". The official verdict is that this is VERY  good. I layered my flavorings by using fresh and dried herbs as well as seasoning salt and paprika. I also added a splash of red wine. The end result is a very tasty dish.

I really liked this and to be honest not many recipes are keepers for me, somehow people always give them a 5 and i feel like i did something wrong, but this is a 5! I used sweet Italian sausage and took them out of the casing and did as the other reviewer suggested and used fresh spinach and just drained my pasta over it to cook it! Great tip! My family liked it so much I will be making it again this week since I have an extra bag of fresh spinach!!

Really easy to make, and very good.  I used a whole bag of fresh spinach, instead of frozen.  Also. I used mild italian sausage, then I add crushed red pepper to spice it up to my heat tolerance

I didn't add the liquid from the tomatoes and instead added some heavy cream and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. With these changes, the recipe is AMAZING!!!

I have an almost identical recipe that I've been using for a few months now.  My family loves it!  My recipe calls for angel hair pasta, shrimp, in place of sausage, and cherry tomatoes cut in half instead of canned.  My personal additions are sliced mushrooms, preferably fresh, and asparagus cut in 1" lengths.  Broccoli would also be a good addition.  This is a very light dish perfect for hot summer nights.

I used turkey sausage, added zucchini, and replaced the parmesan cheese with asiago, along with doubling the basil and adding a sprinkling of oregano. Cooking the penne a couple minutes less then al dente allowed me to cook it in the sauce longer, which in turn made the pasta soak up more juices preventing this from being runny. Fold in fresh spinach at the end and this was a really fast weeknight meal. Different vegetable variations will keep this fresh, making this a perfect recipe to keep in rotation.

I use this versatile and tasty recipe in many variations; the sausage casings can be removed before frying, the sausages can be cut into pieces after cooking, or they can be left whole and removed when cooked and  served on the side. If you want more non-meat content add some sundried tomatoes, asparagus tips, and or black olives. Works also very well with chorizo sausage, jalapeno peppers and/or feta cheese instead of the parmesan.

This was great!! Made a few adjustments, used an entire box of linguine, and a lb and a half of the italian hot sausage, and an entire bag of fresh spinach cut up.  Cut off sausage casings, and then cooked whole for ten minutes, then cut into round pieces, added the parsley, but also crushed red peppers, freshly grounded pepper, oregeno, and chili powder.  Added spinach the same time as tomatoes (used canned diced tomatoes with chilis)and onions( i used a red onion, as its a bit sweeter), added a bit of hot sauce to that mixture.  Covered and cooked for an additional ten minutes, to get rid of the extra liquid.  It was awesome.  Next time I will use a larger can of tomatoes, because of the extra pasta and sausage, and maybe even some zucchini or summer squash slices.

This is DELICIOUS!!!  Adding 1/2 tsp. of salt improved it for our family as well as using fresh spinach and tomatoes versus frozen/canned.  It looks very elegant and can be served to guests as well as a week-night family supper.  Very easy for the outcome!

Love, love LOVE this recipe! I've made it with both fresh and frozen spinach. I prefer the fresh. I do put the spinach in the colander and drain the pasta over it and then just add all to my skillet. This is an easy dish and my kids love it! It's also my go to dish for taking suppers to people. It's different, but so delicious!

This recipe was excellent.It didn't say not to drain the sausage so, I didn't and I think that was a good idea, the sauce had a nice richness of flavor. I think letting all the ingredients simmer for at least 15 to 20 minutes is a good idea also, let the flavors come together. I did not use the full 14.5 ounces of broth as I felt it was too much liquid. I left a few ounces out. Also, I ended up using a tablespoon of corn starch as the sauce was just too thin for my taste. My sweetie and I ate most of it in one sitting. Simply delicious.

I was skeptical about the liquid and I didn't want to add the spinach as I thought the pan would oil over, but I am so glad I stuck to the recipe! It was great! I used turkey sausage and wheat penne pasta. Yum and healthy!

Can I Give MORE Than 5 Stars?! This Recipe Smelled Good From The Start! I Definitely Cooked It A Little Longer Than Directed, Due To Girl Talk. But It May Have Made It Taste Better Doing It, Ha! This Recipe Blew My Mind & My Tastebuds! My Husband, 4 Year Old Picky-Eater Daughter Loved It So Much, They Pretty Much Licked The Bowls Clean. I Gave Some To My Neighbors To Try And She Thought It Was So Awesome, She Demanded The Recipe That Night. I Am Sad To Say There Were No Left Overs, So I'm Putting It On My Shopping List For This Week! =) Cheap Ingredients, Simple To Make, Perfect Outcome! Def A Keeper Recipe!

Thank you Tammy, This was Excellent.

So easy and so wonderful.  I followed the recipe but made a few changes.  I used fresh Spinach and  added 4oz sliced Black Olives.  Perfect meal with hot crusty Italian bread.  I will definitely make this dish again.

This was EXCELLENT!!!  I used 3 cups of uncooked penne and it was perfect.  I took the casing off of the sausage.  I also used a fresh bag of spinach and chopped it up and added it to the tomato & sausage mixture at the very end, just enough to wilt it. I will definitely make this again.  The entire family gave it five stars.

Really good.  DH didn't care for it due to all the spinach.  I will have to use half the spinach if I make it again.

I loved this recipes for its flavor and how easy it was to make on a busy weeknight. The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat penne, sweet italian turkey sausages and no cheese. Trying to eat a bit healthier. Thanks for the keeper!

This was awesome! I did make some changes. I deglazed the pan with 1/2 c. cooking sherry and then added the onion, garlic and 1 sweet red pepper. Sauteed them for about 5 min. then added chicken boullion, water and tomatoes. I subbed the spinach for collard greens. This is definitely a keeper.

The only thing we fault this recipe is for the lack of seasonings, it was lacking in that. The spinach was a nice addition though so will keep in recipe rotation just adding more italian seasonings to the sauce.

This was REALLY good!  Only slight variations:  Cooked the onion (used about ¼ of a purple onion) in the oil before I put in my pork.  For the spinach,  I used up the last of my fresh baby spinach we use in salads that was a little wilted.  I don’t like it soggy, so to make it tender, I just tore it up and put it in the bottom of my colander before I drained the pasta, so the boiling water poured over it.  I also used chicken bouillon to cook the pasta & used all the left over pastas I had (some whole wheat, some spiral, some elbow), and fresh basil chopped fine rather than dried…and I added a little bit of cayenne pepper to the sausage as it cooked for a little spice (about 1/16 tsp).   I think it would be good with zucchini or asparagus tips too.  ?  Was a total throw together meal that ended up being really good!   Try it!

LOVE it!!!  The thing I did not like though was that I mixed it all together, with the pasta and when I had it as left overs the next day it was really slimy.  So, next time just don't mix it all, if you are going to keep it for left overs, keep the pasta and sauce separate.  Other than that it was amazing!!!

Great recipe!  This is my first review and I've used this site for years.  My husband and my kids (age 2&3) loved it and all three of them are really picky eaters. I did make some changes though since I didn't have everything I needed. So instead of the 14.5 oz can of tomatoes I had a 10oz so I used that and some tomato puree I had. Also I used half an onion and cut them so thin because my hubby doesn't like them and I used garlic powder.  And I only had parsley so I used fresh parsley as well and it was still fantastic.  Great for left overs! ! ;)

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I had a bag of fresh spinach on hand, not frozen spinach.

It was SO delicious. To some, it may appear to be a little bit of work but I promise it is well worth the effort! My boyfriend and I were gobbling this down, we cannot help it, it's so delicious.

One of our favorite dishes is a broccoli and sausage pasta (VERY similar to this recipe, and can be found on allrecipes) this recipe has a different twist to it, but they are equally delicious. Makes even better leftovers, too.

This recipe is wonderful.  I am not a health nut, but I made the recipe with whole wheat pasta, turkey sausage and fresh spinach and it was really, REALLY good.  Even my kids liked it.

I have a recipe similar to this.  Add some cream or half & half to thicken the sauce.  Also, add some crushed red pepper to give it a little heat, a few cut up sun-dried tomatoes.  YUM!  I also use whole wheat pasta for more fiber and better taste.

As is, I can only give this recipe 3 stars--it need doctoring.  I added some flour to the sauce to thicken it (way too watery at first), and then some half & half to make a creamy sauce.  Just before serving, I put some mozzerella on top.  With these changes, it was wonderful!  My husband loved it, and at all the leftovers the next day!  Thanks for a basic recipe, but like I said, it definitely needs some things added.

Wow,wow this was GREAT!  Per other reviews I substituted fresh basil for dry, fresh spinach for frozen ( I roughly chopped up a small pre-washed bag of spinach and added it the colander with the boiling pasta less than a minute before before lifting out the colander) and substituted a large can of diced tomatoes for the smaller one.  For sausage I used a pound and quarter package of name brand Italian link hot  sausage, removed the skins and chopped links into bite size pieces before adding to the pan. Per another review I put the chopped onions/garlic in the pan at same time as the sausage.  Used a pound of pasta, which fit perfectly with the increased tomatoes and sausage.  Also threw on extra grated cheese and tossed it all together in a large bowl before serving at the end.  Yes, there  is a good amount of juice, but it was wonderful to sop up with Italian bread! No bowl necessary, plates worked fine.  Definitely serve this with bread!!! Everyone LOVED it, even my picky picky daughter.  Definitely stay with the hot sausage, we all thought it made this great.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!!!!!

Everybody really enjoyed this one, except my four year old. He thought it was too spicy. I used mild sausage, and threw in about 3 pinches of crushed red pepper flakes. I also sprinkled some flour over the sausage after it was browned to make a roux with the sausage grease. I added half a cup of milk, 2 cups of chicken broth and then followed the rest of the recipe. Delicious, we'll have this again.

this was very good, and extremely easy. i added 1/4 c. white wine after the onions and garlic were browned, substituted chicken sausage for the pork, fresh spinach for frozen, and about 1/3 c. chopped fresh basil for the tsp. of dried. next time, i think that i will add some sliced mushrooms.

Followed the recipe exactly, I am only rating this as a 4* as its ok, just not great.  Too watery, next time I will reduce the amount of stock and also the taste was rather bland. I guess it needs a little something to spice it up.

Sausage Pasta Haiku: "Okay, here's the thing. Great taste, but way soupy. Why all the liquid?" I gave up on making any pasta to go with this b/c the chicken broth and undrained tomatoes never reduced, and I even added corn starch, per other reviewers' suggestions. What I started with tasted wonderful, but as it simmered, and simmered some more, I banked on squishy noodles, so I ended up serving this with something that *SHAZAM!* was even better than pasta. (Cauliflower alla Parmagiana recipe from here.) We loved the whole sausage/tomato/spinach/basil taste, but I just didn't like that it remained like soup. If I make this again (pass on pasta, yay for cauliflower), I would skip the broth and opt for a splash of red wine, if needed.

                                                                               10/23/15 Update Haiku: "I made this last night. Five stars with alterations. Too many changes." Due to muddling my way through the new website, I found this recipe that I'd made 4+ yrs. ago in my "Favorites" (harhar, it's not technically a favorite of mine though) and thought I'd give it another try. Used Italian sausage links that I browned in 1/2" cubes w/ onion, garlic and bell pepper. Mixed in 8 oz. fresh baby spinach to quickly wilt and mixed in drained Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes, salt/pepper, basil and oregano - using a slotted spoon, transferred everything to a casserole dish, topped w/ mozzarella and baked 350 for 20 min. Nomnomerific now!

this was a wonderful and unique taste. I asked my hubby what he thinks i should change (if i should at all) and he said no leave it that way becuase it makes this dish stand out from most pastas. Its very healthy to boot! I did let it simmer and come down more, to have less juices, and it was perfect like that!

This was good, I just felt like there was something missing.  It was so easy that if I have everything on hand I will be making it again.  I think maybe a little bit of sauce of some kind or something to thicken this would make it better.

This will be a staple at our house! I made it with Italian seasoned turkey for a lower fat version and added red pepper flakes for a bit of spice. Love how this can be modified with any veggie for tons of variations. Try it!

We enjoyed this pasta, but it does call for a little more flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, so next time I think it might benefit from some added red pepper flakes & more fresh italian herbs.  Also, I think fresh spinach might be the way to go.  As written, it's still a good dish and quick to put together on a weeknight.  It also presents beautifully!  I'm always looking for lighter pasta dishes without the heavy tomato or cream sauces, so thanks for the recipe!

Man O Man! This is an awesome pasta dish! My family loved it. I followed the exact recipe. The only thing I did different was to add the broth gradually until I saw what I needed so it wouldn't be too soupy. We will definitely be making it again. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a fantastic basic recipe that is easy and quick to prepare on a weeknight or whenever you are in a hurry. I have made this recipe as is and it is very pretty on the plate and oh so yummy. What I especially like about this recipe is that it can be changed up in so many ways so it is always "fresh and new". I have made this dish many times with one or more variations to this basic recipe. The changes include: replace the sausage with skinless, boneless, diced or shredded chicken (fresh made or leftover), replace the dried basil with pesto, replace the diced tomatoes with spicier Rotel type tomatoes or use fresh diced tomatoes, use some drained pasta water in place of the chicken stock, use diced yellow peppers with the onions to add even more color to the presentation on the plate, but any way you make it is great looking and great tasting. Don't get me wrong, the recipe is great without changing a thing, but one or more of these other variations can help keep this dish from getting boring if it hits your regular menu rotation on a consistent basis.

This recipe was ridiculous. It is under-seasoned, and if you follow the recipe as is, it will come out swimming in broth and water.  Awful, do not try it.  The adjustments are so numerous as to not be worth it.  Find something else!!!!

AWESOME!!! My 6 year old gobbled it up, we couldn't believe how quiet he was during dinner which makes this a definite keeper. My changes were as follows - 1) used Rotini pasta and drained it on top of the spinach as recommended 2) after cooking the sausage (I use mild italian free of antibiotic/hormones) in the garlic/onion combo, i added 1 can of diced tomatoes w/celery and onions (Aylmer) 3) 1/2 cup of red wine  4) 1 cube of Organic Chicken Bouillon 5) 1 tsp of basil AND oregano 6) added a handful of thinly sliced mushrooms and let everything simmer for around 20-25 minutes. I then stirred in the pasta/spinach and five minutes later, voila! an absolutely delicious Monday evening meal!! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

Delicious! I used vegetable broth and a package of Field Roast vegetarian sausages, to make this vegetarian. It was SO good! I used the apple sage sausages, but the Italian ones would be awesome as well. I also used fresh spinach in the strainer for the pasta, like another reviewer suggested, and it came out great. My only other modification was to cook it quite a bit longer (15 minutes +, at a high simmer), as it's pretty soupy with all that broth and I like a thicker sauce so I let it boil down.

Fantastic, quick dinner.  The whole family loved it, including my picky 8 yr old and pickier husband.  I even used italian chicken sausage and whole wheat pasta and they STILL loved it.  Crazy.  

I used grape tomatoes that I roasted in the toaster oven for a few minutes until they popped, fresh spinach, and added a 1/4 c of sun dried tomatoes (the dry ones, not in oil).  Fantastic dinner!!! Thanks!

This was delicious...been craving it ever since I made it.  4 stars only b/c I made some whole food oriented changes:  whole wheat pasta, fresh spinach, and cherry tomatoes halved (one container...a pint?).  So yummy and easy!  My children loved it, too, even though my daughter ate around the tomatoes...I ate what she left!

This was great! I did just about follow the recipe,but I used chicken sausage instead of regular, and added a bit more olive oil. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, fresh tomatoes instead of canned and fresh basil.  I also tossed in 1/2 cup of cubed mozzarella since I was trying to get rid of it.  

I'm sure the fresh ingredients could only improve it, but it was a wonderful recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Great recipe, even with mild italian sausage (that's what I had). I added a touch of crushed red pepper (but not so much the kids wouldn't eat it) and used roasted garlic chicken broth and diced tomatoes with basil and garlic (again what I had on hand) and it turned out pretty good. I did have to add a tablespoon of cornstarch in the end to thicken it slightly. My 6 year old even liked it! Will make again!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! I made this with not too high of expectations. It just contained ingredients I had in my house. Well I made it and used a larger sized can of diced tomatoes and a little more noodles because it was the whole meal. It was great! Great flavor, but real light. No heavy sauce here. My husband is the pickiest eater I have ever known and when he sees spinach he normally runs away screaming. He tried to make up an excuse not to try this, but once I put it in front of him I made him try it! He went back for seconds then thirds and told me I should make this again! This is an excellent go to meal for a weeknight for sure!

This was very good!  I will definitely be making this again.  The only thing that I felt kept this from being 5 stars was calling for frozen spinach and canned tomatoes.  I used fresh basil (just a pinch since fresh is stronger than dried) and next time I will use fresh spinach and tomatoes.  The frozen spinach actually kind of detracted from and overwhelmed the dish at the same time.  I bet with fresh veggies this will be even better!

Excellent meal!  I used light turkey sweet sausage and fresh basil and the can of diced tomatoes--it was basil, garlic and oregano.  I chose to keep the spinach on the side..Very flavorful and I did add 3-4 tablespoons of half n half for variation.  Delicious!!  Thank you!

Perfect recipe 'as is.' The only subs I make are fresh tomatoes for canned, fresh basil for dried and fresh spinach for frozen. I put the spinach into the colander I drain pasta, and the water steams and cooks the leaves. Some people complain it's bland, but it depends on the kind of sausage you use. I use spicy, so it's got a nice kick. This is in my meal rotation and is a flavorful way to trick husbands and kids alike into eating spinach.

Excellent and elegant. Used whole wheat pasta and grilled mild Italian sausage links that I then cut in 1-2 inch chunks. Added strips of red and green sweet pepper and sauteed about 2 min with onion. Homemade French bread and we had a complete meal.

Followed recipe except left out tomatoes as my family would have just picked them out anyway. I thought it was a little bland--nothing special. On the other hand, it was very easy to put together.

Very easy to put together and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  It was similar to my "Italian Goulash without tomatoes" recipe.  The spinach that Tammy has in her dish though was really a nice addition.  I did go with fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Great recipe!  I did use fresh spinach as others mentioned and added fresh peas and mushrooms.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy to make. My adjustments: whole wheat pasta, turkey sausage, added fresh basil and oregano, and chopped crimini mushrooms. Also added a chopped zucchini. My kids LOVED it and ate all the veggies- that's a BUNCH of veggies in one sitting! It's a keep[er in my house!

Made this exactly as written and my family of 10 all liked it! Very simple and very tasty. Don't skimp on the garlic, it's a must. This will be a regular on our table. Thanks Tammy!

This was very good.  I  added a can of tomato paste for a sweeter taste, and it thickened the sausage/tomato mixture just a bit.  Will definitely make again.

Had a package of Italian sausage in the freezer for a couple weeks and not certain what to do with it. This absolutelly solvled that problem. I made this yesterday for tonight's dinner because I'd be out of the house all day. Both of us had a "sneak preview" and a taste test last night and it is delicious, easy to prepare, familiar ingredients and fast. A big winner at our house, Tammy and a recipe I am happily adding to my recipe box.  Thank you!!

This is a great way to get kids to eat spinach.  Yummm!  

Needs a little salt or something.  Not sure what.

This has the potential to be really delicious but it came out way too salty. I didn't add any additional spices so I think it was just the combination of the sodium in the sausage and chicken broth.

This was a delicious dish! I didn't alter too much from the original recipe, but I did use fresh spinach instead of the frozen and used bulk Italian sausage. I feared the sauce was going to be a bit too thin while cooking so I added a Tsp of corn starch to thicken it up a bit. This recipe is DEFINITELY staying in my rotation!!

My kids love this one. I try different sausages every time I make it. Easy enough my teen boys can make it. Not a saucy pasta as you can see in photos. Nice for a change to not have so much heavy sauce on pasta, so if you are looking for a sausage pasta without a heavy sauce, this is for you.

I used a basil pesto smoked chicken sausage with provolone and Parmesan instead of Italian sausage which gave it a milder flavor but still very tasty.

I've been making a similar recipe for quite a few years.  Nice basic recipe.  Also a great way to use up veggies in fridge. A few of these.  A couple of those.  If I'm abundant with veggies I'll roast them first & then add them. Also sometimes I add a little fennel.  Maybe a bay leaf or Italian seasoning.  Be creative.  I never make it the same,  but it's always good.

Made this tonight and thought it was pretty darn good!  I used 3 links of hot and 3 of sweet sausage, added a small amount of cayenne (based on other reviews), used fresh spinach.  When I added the broth and tomatoes, I raised the heat and got it to boiling, then lowered heat and let simmer maybe 5 minutes.  I then stirred in fresh spinach and pasta.  My sauce clung to the pasta and spinach fine.  I added the cheese and stirred it all again and it was quite tasty!  I am actually not a huge fan of any type sausage, but the sauce, pasta, and especially the spinach tasted great.  Had I had fresh basil, I would have used it, but it was good anyway.

This is a very easy dish to make and I cook this at least once a week and there is usually no leftovers.  I use regular pork ground sausage, fresh spinach, and add a little bit of red pepper flake to give it a little kick since I don't use spicy sausage and serve it with penne pasta.  It always turns out good and taste the same every time, very flavorful!!

This dinner was a hit! Talk about taste, texture and presentation--this pasta dinner had it all. I used mild Italian Turkey Sausage which I slow cooked in a small crockpot. I removed the meat and let cool before slicing into buttons. Meanwhile I added the juice from the crockpot to a 10 inch skillet and sautéd the onions and garlic. I did not drain the spinach or the canned tomatoes (I used Hunt's fire-roasted tomatoes), but I only used 1/2 cup of chicken broth for flavor. The mixture reduced in about 8-10 minutes before I added back the sliced sausage. I used miniature penne pasta because that's what was on hand. I did not need any extra seasonings. I cooked the pasta according to directions then drained and added back to sausage mixture along with cheese. This seemed to thicken the mixture PERFECTLY. Can believe how yummy this turned out. Will definitely make again.

This was super easy! The only change I made, like many others, was to use fresh spinach and I did use turkey Italian sausage since that's just all I purchase. My husband kept telling me what a wonderful cook I was...I felt guilty for accepting this compliment as it was such a simple dinner to make and I just followed the recipe.

This was DELICIOUS!  So easy and my 8yr old son said, "Oh Mom! This is a keeper!" A great weekday dinner.  Try it today, you will not be disappointed.  I used hot italian sausage and it had just the right amount of kick.

Getting fresh high quality salsiccia (italian sausage) can make this recipe into an absolute bombshell of a meal. I bought some fresh salsiccia from an italian deli next to my apartment in Berlin. My girlfriend and I both agreed this was the best pasta dish we have made in years, to be honest, maybe ever. But the key is really high quality salsiccia. I also added in some white wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the sausage and onions. I am not exagerrating this came out absolutely amazing. We will make this a regular recipe and have it at least once a month now, it was also very easy and fast to prepare.

Awesome!  Reduced the fat by cooking the sausage until 5 minutes from done, drained it, then added the oil and cooked the onion and garlic with the meat.  As another reviewer suggested, I used fresh spinach and just stirred the leaves into the sauce for a couple minutes until wilted and bright green.  Whole family loved it - no complaints!

This is my son's FAVORITE dish!  He would eat this every night if I made it.  It's a simple weeknight.  I do make 1 change and use fresh baby spinach.  I snap the stems off and then put it in the colander and add the hot pasta to it as I am draining it.  This way it isn't overcooked. Delish!

This is an absolute keeper! I love red wine in cooking, so I added about 1/2 cup and reduced the amount of broth by that much as well. The consistency was perfect and the taste was light and divine! Thank you for sharing. :)

This is a keeper with my family!  I always add more sausage (both hot and mild with casings removed) than what is called for and also use fresh basil and a whole bag of fresh bag spinach.  We usually use mini shells with this since the pasta "traps" some of the broth.  I do let this simmer to reduce the broth a bit.  While this is great the first day - it's even better the next!

This is a favorite! The only change I made was to use fresh spinach instead of frozen. I am a personal chef and one couple I cook for asks for this dish almost every week. Tomorrow I'm going to make it with chicken and add some red and yellow bell peppers. Should be great! I love this recipe!

A family favorite!  It can be difficult to find a recipe conducive to low-sodium, whole grain, turkey sausage, easy on the tomatoes, kid-friendly AND delicious recipe.  This one is on our meal rotation for sure.  We used fresh basil and wow.  This is fantastic.  Thanks so much for sharing- our lives are better for it- really.

This was great!!  I did add mushrooms when I added the onion. Also like others said, I reduced it a little longer so it wasn't soupy.  But over all, a great dish and I will make again.

Fantastic!  I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of a can, fresh spinach and vegetable broth, because that's what I had around and it was great!  My sausage was fatty enough that I didn't add the olive oil.  I didn't need it.

This is an easy delicious dinner!  Cook with whole wheat pasta for a healthy addition and use low-salt chicken broth.

it was good....rather sloppy, not sure if it were soup or stoop or what. Added yellow peppers and Italian seasoning hubby and I had a bowl for supper and then I took the rest (makes a ton)put it into a 9 x 13 and put 5 slices of havarti cheese in middle and covered with rest and put more cheese on the top.  Will bake for tomorrow night when the girlfriends come....salad and garlic bread and perhaps some hot molten chocolate dessert and some cocoa vino....

This was good.  I'd make it again, but remove the casings or use ground sausage.  My family liked the 'bites' with the sausage in them, but not as much without.

I thought this recipe was a good start but was just missing something! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Oh yeah, and fresh basil! I used a sweeter type of sausage and I think next time I will use a more italian & spicy sausage.

very good, some said it was too watery, so instead of adding chicken broth, I mixed together about 8 oz. of water and about 2 tablespoons of chicken boullion, this worked great.  I also let it simmmer a bit longer.

Very good.  I modified this recipe a little to make it lower in calories.  Used Turkey Italian Sausage and whole wheat noodles. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Great taste. Will make this again!

Very good!  Used a mixture of Serra's sausage (local brand) and ShadyBrook Farms Hot Italian Turkey Sausage.  Used lots of fresh spinach, added mushrooms and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.   Excellent, simple, reheated well.  Would make again.

I was expecting this to be much better than it was.  My suggestion would be to use fresh spinach or a different vegetable or cook the frozen spinach by itself first and strain.  The recipe was so dilluted it had no flavor.  No wonder you had to use a half cup of cheese on top of it.

We really enjoyed this.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of using fresh spinach and minced garlic from a jar.  My grocery store had ground spicy Italian sausage, so I didn't have to mess with the membrane.  Easy and Yum!  What's not to like about that!!!

A delicious meal!  My Italian (picky eater) husband raved about this one!  I used Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of the sausage, fresh spinach and fresh basil, and a can of fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes.  I used Barilla Gemelli pasta, which my husband said made it tops.  Will definitely make this again!!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except I added bell peppers. It looked soupy until I added the pasta. It went very well with the family.

I'm giving this only 3 stars because my family didn't like it.  I quite liked the recipe though.  It's good as is.  Unfortunately I won't be making it again because of my rather picky family!  Sorry!

Excellent! I followed the recipe very close - I did use 1lb pasta though.  The flavor was fantastic, DH & DS really loved this as much as I did.  It was a little brothy but we didn't mind.  I bought sweet sausage, and used a can of dice tomatoes with green chilies, a brand I never used before - so one of these ingredients were much spicier than usual, either the sausage was marked wrong & really wasn't 'sweet' or the chilies in the diced tomatoes were quite potent - we like spicy fortunately (SS not so much but he wasn't home). I had extra mushrooms and I wish I remembered to add some of them, they would have gone great in this but there's always next time :)

Didn't change any of the steps or ingredients. The key is to undercook (strictly al-dente) the pasta. Perfect, simple meal for those busy week nights. If you have the ingredients stocked, it is even better!

I have made this 2 times now and both times stayed with the original recipe as written - no real changes need be made.  I meant to add mushrooms the 2nd time however forgot to grab when shopping.  This is a big hit and has definitely become one of our favorites!

Excellent! My family practically stood up and cheered. Even my son who does not like sausage gave this a big thumbs up. I like that it can be added to without changing the entire dish. In my case, I added zuchinni and a bit of pesto. We will definitely be having this again and again.

Wow this was good.  I added some salt, a half cup of cream, a chopped sweet red pepper, and loads of extra parmesan.  My chidren (ages 4 to 13) said "I don't link spinach", then proceeded to gobble it up and go for seconds.  This will be a weekly meal for us - and is especially easy for dinner on Sunday between church services.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, I think it was the quality of my frozen spinach, but this had a wet dog taste and smell. I'm thinking next time, no spinach, maybe zucchini or eggplant. We did eat it even with the odd taste.

This is an awsome recipe.  Had to buy italian sausage links (the large ones), grocery store didn't have ground sausage, just removed the casing and chopped while cooking.  I used mild italian sausage and added red pepper to my liking.  I was a bit concerned about the taste of these ingredients together but it was delicious, just the right amount of spices mixed together.  Will definately make again!

Made this tonight for supper, it was excellant! I used fresh spinach, fresh garlic and fresh basil and italian turkey sausage. Also added extra olive oil since turkey sausage doesnt have much grease. It came out so delicious that I could have licked the plate. Served with garlic bread for a fabulous meal. Thanks Tammy!

I omit the spinach (medication interaction) and use a side dish veggie. I use mild Italian sausage that has been cooked and thinly sliced and add some fennel seeds and crushed red pepper. Then I add some freshly grated Parmesan on each serving in amounts of each persons preference.

You do not need to take sausage out of casing. All sausage should be pierced with a fork or knife before cooking - will not curl up.  Thank you.  Did not try - sounds OK.

This was really good.  My husband doesn't like tomatoes, so I didn't use them, but did add mushrooms, bell pepper and zucchini.  Other than the vegetable substitutions, I made it as written and it was delicious.

This was really good and the only thing I changed was, I cooked down the sauce so it wasn't runny, added a bit of cream and it thickened up very nicely.  Omitted spinach, as my son doesn't like spinach, but overall, I loved it.  Thanks for his recipe.

Pretty Good!  This will be better next time a make it.  I didn't add all the chicken broth, still to watery - mostly my fault for not letting it thicken long enough.  Maybe not add all the juice from the diced tomatoes as well.

Just got this in email today.  I had made a version of this last night.  I made it a cold pasta salad.  Used Hillshires beef sausages cut into quarter pieces and diced 1/4 in thick. cooked them and cooled after draining.  cooked and cooled bowtie pasta.  Added canned italian green beans drained and can of italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  Again, the beans and tomatoes were not cooked further than the processing to can them.  Season to taste with garlic powder, black pepper, and celery salt.  Add just enough olive oil to lubricate.  Sorry I rarely measure if I'm in create mode!  If I had them I would of added sliced black olives.  I recommend adding the parmasean cheese to each dish.

i make something similar to this all the time except no spinach or tomatoes, and I throw in white wine and red and yellow peppers with the onions.  It is one of my all time favorite meals.  I too use turkey sausage to cut back on the fat. I am definetly going to throw spinach in next time and cut back on the peppers.

I made the mistake of grabbing a can of beef broth instead of chicken broth but it was still delicious and a very pretty dish too. I also used fresh spinach but I think I might try it as written next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious for such a simple recipe, so much flavor with so few ingredients.  Mine was slightly salty likely because I used boullion to make the chicken broth.  I also used rigatoni for the pasta, I would recommend something slightly smaller, penne would be perfect.  I made as recipe stated, I noticed some added paprika, but I used my own homemade sausage which already had that in it.  Try it as written, you won't be disappointed.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes from this site. I've made it twice and both times the flavor turned out amazing!!! My only complaint is that the chicken broth makes for quite a soupy thin sauce. The second time I made this dish I let the sauce cook way down before adding the pasta. Yum!!

Really tasty. I'm just a single person, so I halfed the recipe. My only suggestions are to add 1/8 tsp. of salt, simmer until the broth/tomato juice reduces by half. Then stir in about 2 tbsp. of flour, or until the broth thickens. (Measurements are based on halfing the recipe.) I didn't have any spinach or basil, so I omitted that, and it still tastes good. I might add some red pepper flakes for an extra kick. The basil might have brought more depth into the flavor, but it still tastes darn good without.

I used small shell pasta for this recipe, which was better at holding onto the bits of sausage and spinach.  This was extremely easy to prepare, taking up no more time than a spaghetti and meatball recipe.  I think it would be improved with the addition of some shredded mozza cheese, though.  I used Beer Bratwurst, because that's what I had on hand.  As another person suggested, I prepped the sausage by defrosting it slightly and removing it from the casing so I could cook it as sausage crumbles before adding the other ingredients.  I think replacing the dried basil with a substantial amount of fresh basil would also help.  I couldn't really taste the (dried) basil in this recipe, despite it being freshly purchased.  I did add fresh ground black pepper for an extra kick.  Over all, excellent recipe for a quick but delicious weekday dinner.  Serve with a crunchy bread.

Very good - I added celery, red and jalapeno pepper (seeded) and used 2 small fresh tomatoes and fresh spinach instead of canned/frozen. I used shredded parmigiano reggiano cheese and chicken spinach sausage. Excellent flavors together!

Not really one pot.  It was too soupy, and four cloves of garlic was just too much for us.

Make this all in one pot without boiling the pasta separately!  Just use 2 14.5 oz. cans of broth instead of one, plus a half  cup of water.  Add 1 tbsp of dried oregano leaves, 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and a tbsp of evoo.  Brown the meat first then just throw all of the other ingredients in  the pot, dry pasta included and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring every two minutes, until pasta is cooked and liquid is reduced.  If you want to reduce the liquid more, let simmer with lid off for a few more minutes.  Sprinkle with fresh chopped basil and grated parmesan cheese--yummy and one-pot easy!

Spices are the key to this dish!!! Oregano is a must and mine was a bit wet so I added some tomato sauce.

Made this for my family and they said it was pretty good. Used turkey sausage instead of spicy Italian sausage, and that might've been the problem. My family said that it needed more spice, so I'll keep that in mind next time.

I have to say this was pretty tasty. I  used both mild and spicy Italian sausage but I did have to drain the meat and next time I will use fresh spinach. I also added salt, pepper and Parmesan during and after.

Delicious and only 15 min to make!  I used turkey kielbasa and whole wheat pasta to make this healthy but at the last minute I panicked that it was too healthy so I added a 1/2 cup heavy cream to give it some body.  My picky 3 year old ate her whole meal..it was that good!  Will make again for sure, thanks!

We loved this delicious easy to prepare  dish.  I used diced Italian tomatoes and didn't use quite the whole can of chicken broth.  This is a great combination of flavors.  I did add about a teaspoon of pesto.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe Tammy.

I made this almost exactly as written, but I cut everything in half (there's just the two of us).  Six ounces of pasta was too much, next time I'll go with four.  I used a 5 ounce bag of fresh spinach, and 2 Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausages (1/4 lb. each), removing it from the casing and crumbling it into the skillet.  With a non-stick skillet I didn't use any oil.   Be sure you use a LARGE skillet! :)  The sauce tastes rather plain by itself, but take a bite of sausage with it and it's really, really good!  Very flavorful, you don't need spicy sausage unless that's your thing, I don't like hot, I like flavor.   This really needs some salt, though.  I added salt and pepper to it after it was in my bowl and before I added the cheese, but it would have better to have a little salt stirred into it.   I did add a couple of tablespoons of half and half, but it didn't make much difference.  A slice of garlic bread on the side is excellent.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  It is a nice change from using a heavier sauce with our pasta.  The only thing I changed was to use sweet sausage due to personal preference.  This is now in my dinner rotation!

This recipe was too bland for me....I followed it exactly but ended up adding more seasoning, basil, oregano,Rosemary, parsley, white pepper, sage, savory, cayenne, thyme and a few more. and eventually made a tomatoe sauce with mushrooms  to add which made this pretty good.  I probably would make this again but my way....

Excellent recipe for its flexibility. I wanted to use ingredients I had on hand so I removed the casing from sweet sausages and added some crushed red pepper for the spiciness. I had no diced tomatoes, instead, used canned pasta sauce. Finally, I used canned spinach. It worked. Please note, after cooking the sausage, you need to pour off the excess grease. My wife loved it.

So yummy, next time I make this I will double the recipe. Used fresh spinach, my only change. Served in bowl, very little liquid left. I think others didn't simmer enough to reduce the liquid.

Made this when my 6 year old picky granddaughter was here and she had 3 helpings. I used turkey Italian sausage and added a few red pepper flakes so it had a hint of a kick. Also used fresh spinach in the colander. It is very versatile and will probably add fresh mushrooms next time. It is great reheated too. Used whole wheat penne pasta.

This was really good!!  Two small changes I made were more diced tomatoes (I only had a 28oz can) and I didn't have much parmesan so I used a little of it and about 1/4 cup of cream cheese.  I had to let it simmer a little longer to thicken enough because of the increase in tomatoes.   Dynamite!!!

Wow, This was very good. Didn't have any spinach, so I added 1 can of green beans & chopped bell pepper, did need to thicken the sauce with a little bit of Wondra flour. Will definitely make this again & take it to our community potluck this winter.

Flavor swerve good. I added a little more basil tho. And I forgot to get spinach so I added frozen peas. I the ought it was really good as the peas gave it a bit if a different crunch. My husband would have like a little thicker sauce so I may try adding a 1/4 cup tomato sauce and less liquid from the tomatoes!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was light and healthy tasting despite the pasta, canned tomatoes and frozen spinach.  We used rigatoni noodles.  I squeezed every drop of juice I could out of the spinach and did not drain the tomatoes.  Only had sweet sausage, but put a generous helping of red pepper flakes on it to put the kick back in.  As other users have noted, it is quite soupy at first, but wait!  Don't serve it immediately.  Give the flavors a chance to blend and the pasta a chance to absorb the liquid.  My 2nd helping 40 minutes later was bursting with restaurant quality flavor and all the flavors came together. I suspect the leftovers will be quite dry tomorrow and any remaining moisture the noodles will have drunk (drank?).  Hoping a splash of chicken broth will bring it back to life.

I used fresh spinach and fresh cherry tomatoes cut in half,  also added some fennel seeds that I crushed in a mortar.

The second time I made it, I put it in a baking dish, sprinkled a good doze of shredded mozzarella on it and baked it until it was bubbly and the cheese browned,  what a hit that was!

This recipe is very good, but I drained the fat out of the pan after cooking the sausage.  I can't imagine all of the fat in the final dish if you don't.  However, if your final dish is not "wet" enough you can replace the sausage fat with olive oil.  I make a similar dish with olive oil and it is very good, as well.  Otherwise this dish is great "as is" with or without the cheese.

I do not normally write reviews but this is a great meal! My husband and I loved it and want to make more soon.  I used hot Italian sausage and it had plenty of kick to it!  Like others I used fresh spinach and drained my pasta over the spinach.  I used part fresh basil and part dried, just based on what I had on hand.  I did use seasoned canned diced tomatoes -- mine had green chilies -- just what I had on hand.  I also added about 1/3 cup red wine (Merlot) to give it body and reduced the chicken broth to about 12 oz.  Once the liquid was added, I brought it to a boil and then simmered to thicken the sauce.  I also added about 1-2 tablespoons of Wondra as a thickener (like flour but doesn't clump -- in the same area as flour at the store).  I prepared the noodles (I had bow tie) and spinach as the last step while the sauce was boiling/simmering to thicken.  Then I mixed it all together and sprinkled individual servings with an Italian blend shredded cheese.  Although I agree with another viewer, it is just as good with or without the cheese!  My dish was not soupy at all since I thickened, boiled and simmered the sauce for at least 20 minutes.  I can't wait to eat this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is excellent and so flexible!  My family's favorite is to use yellow and red peppers for vegetable, sweet turkey sausage, and beef broth instead of chicken. Toss with 1/4 cup chopped parsley before serving. Colorful and simple and a terrific hit every time!

This was yummy but....it was more soup like-not thick enough for pasta. I ended up eating it on top of rice instead. Would follow some of the tips of others next time. But I know I will enjoy again.

This is my favorite recipe that I make. It is so easy, flavorful and kid-friendly. It is easy enough for weekdays, but nice enough to serve to guests. I use fresh spinach in exchange for frozen.

Wonderfully easy and delicious meal.  I did dice up some carrots and put them in with the noodles while they cooked.  Also added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and fennel.  Sauteed celery and red bell peppers with the onions.  Next time, I think when I add the chicken broth, I'll throw in the uncooked noodles and let them absorb the flavors rather than reduce the liquid. Adding water as needed.

Really simple and easy! I love it when I can serve my family a complete meal in one bowl. I did use fresh baby spinach, wilted by draining the pasta over it in a colander. Simmered the sausage mixture for quite a while - about 15min - to meld flavors and reduce, then poured that over the pasta and just toss well. With the ample amount of leftovers I plan to add more chicken broth, and another bag of baby spinach, to make soup!

I made this recipe with the following changes.  1) Used half spicy (hot) and half mild Italian sausage (casings removed). 2) Omitted olive oil and fried the sausage with the onions and garlic. 3) When sausage was done, added 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms, sliced, and 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, and sauted for 1-2 minutes. 4) Omitted the chicken broth and added two (14.5 oz) cans Italian style diced tomatoes and simmered mixture for 5-6 minutes. 5) Removed from heat and added 3 cups roughly torn fresh spinach, 8 oz. cubed mozzarella cheese, and cooked penne, stirring well to combine.  Sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese and baked in 425 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. Delicious! Thanks, Tammy, for a wonderful and versatile recipe!

Altered this recipe by using  hamburger meat and omitted the olive oil. Cooked the hamburger meat through, drained, and then followed recipe as shown.

Just made it , it was my first time . It was delicious , I used ground hot Italian sausage. I'm wondering if I should have drained the Italian sausage. The only reason it is not 5 stars is it lacked seasoning . Next time in addition to seasoning i will add more meat for my husband.

This came out great! Easily done for a weeknight meal.  I did increase cooking time to 15 min because it was a lot of liquid to reduce.  Also added a tsp of salt to the end product.  Choose flavorful sausage, it makes a difference! Very good recipe, will definitely make again!

I don't like when reviewers change the recipe and then rate it, but I don't want to miss a 5 star rating here so I will go against my own belief!  Loved this dinner...my husband even said "A+"!  I did what other reviewers suggested: took sausage out of casing, used fresh halved cherry tomatoes, fresh spinach that I "cooked" in the strainer with the pasta water, and fresh basil.  I also added a splash of red wine and a splash of heavy cream. The only downside was that our kids do not like spinach, but I'm not letting that stop me! Will be adding this in to our regular rotation.

Delicious. I used fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, a little bit of red wine (so less broth), a dash of red pepper flakes. The dish had a nice kick to it, the flavor was excellent. I did not measure anything though.  A keeper for sure as it was made pretty quickly and it was easy.

I tried this recipe (using sweet Italian sausage) and loved it. My family decided that this is one of our new favorites.  I've also made another variation to this recipe. For my second dish, I followed the same recipe just replacing the Italian sausage with baked chicken strips. Equally delicious!

The idea was good. The flavor was deliciios but I think that there was too much pasta for the recipe. I actuallly used chicken italian sausage and I liked the flavor in the dish. I did not use as much chicken broth that was called for. I will make this again!

We all enjoyed this, but I was confused by the broth/sauce.  Like K-Dub, my sauce didn't reduce much so next time I will omit the juice from the can of diced tomatoes.  Overall this was a nice, light pasta dish perfect for a warm evening.

Made this two ways, as written and that was great but the next time was because I had chicken breast, so I substituted that for the sausage, used fresh basil, diced fresh tomatoes and Mrs. Dash's  tomato and basil seasoning and my son came and add a splash of balsamic vinegar to his own portion  that was great too. Great recipe and easy to alter for what you have on hand. Thanks for posting! :-)

I'd really give this more like a 2.5. I round up mostly because my kitchen smelled nicely as it was simmering on the stove. I didn't have any spinach on hand, but I doubt that if I did it would have reduced better. It was VERY soupy. I think this Pasta Pomodoro recipe is a better version of what this tried to be: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pasta-pomodoro/detail.aspx

Loved this recipe! Super easy to make and the day after left-overs were gone, I had a request for it again. I used fresh green veggies and gluten-free pasta and was heavy on the basil. This will go in to normal rotation at my house. Thanks!

This drew rave reviews from husband and son.  I made only one real change (subbed 1/2 cup red wine for 1/2 cup of the chicken broth), other than that I made two "lateral" changes: I used sweet instead of hot sausage (personal preference) and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  For those having problems with it being too thin, I found it needed far more than 5 minutes to reduce.  I reduced for about 10 minutes before adding the spinach, then started the pasta after I added the spinach.  I also did not cover the skillet at anytime and it was perfect.  I will be putting this dish on the "A" list.  Thanks.

I used whole wheat penne and all organic ingredients.  I opted to use fresh basil rather than dry.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and did not use the entire amount of chicken broth; I used low sodium broth (about 1/4 cup) and also used chicken spicy Italian sausage.  Easy, fairly quick and tasty.  I wanted to use fresh spinach but the store was out and I used frozen: did not use the entire 10 oz...and I think I'd prefer it with fresh rather than frozen.

We make this as a staple in our family. Though we use brocoli rabe instaed of spinach, escarole is also a tasty substute. Add more broth and it is more a hearty soup.

This was very easy and delishious.  I used 14.5 ounces water & 2 teaspoons Knorr chicken bullion for the chicken broth, since I didn't have the canned.  I cooked it down about a third and used fresh spinach, added in the last 5 minutes. It's a quick and easy weeknight dinner.  It's a keeper!

This one gets a thumbs up in our house.  I always make it with fresh spinach as we're not fans of frozen.  It's great in the summer, as it's not too heavy.  I've even cheated and bought Jimmy Dean's pre-done sausage so I don't have to heat up the kitchen so much.  My one complaint is that the noodles go mushy if you like left-overs the next day.  Maybe they could be kept apart until eating?  Also, when I re-heat it (despite the mushy noodles) I like to add a bit more spinach as it "shrinks" considerably by the next day.

Simple dish! Used fresh spinach and kale instead of frozen (better this way in my opinion) and had to cook more like 20 minutes to reduce as there was a lot liquid. Delicious

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I was a little worried because I made it for a lot of people and it was the first time making it.  I did add the 1/2 cup of red wine and some cream while it was simmering!  I live in Ecuador, so I wasn't sure how well it would turn out, but I ended up using all fresh ingredients-fresh tomatos, basil, spinach and it was seriously SO good.  It made me look like a great cook with not much effort which is right up my alley!  I will defintely make this a staple in my house.  Even my 21/2 year old ate it up!

A recipe that gets rave reviews every time I serve it. It has become a staple at our house....especially when we have company and need a quick, but delicious meal. Just add crusty hot bread...maybe a side dish of fruit...

I love this recipe! Its been a "go to" recipe for me for a couple years now. I make this when I want something flavorful but not too heavy. Its great for any season and last minute meals when you are short on time. I use regular Italian sausage as my kids won't eat the hot, and I add extra spinach because I love spinach!! Other than that, I make this recipe as is. Thank you Tammy!!

This came together fairly quickly. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and some fresh Swiss chard out of the garden instead of the frozen spinach. I only used half of the stalks and added it in with the onions. I ended up using mild Italian sausage since that is what I had on hand but I did add a quarter tsp of red pepper flakes and cooked everything down till my chard leaves reduced then used entire box of pasta and about three quarters of a cup of cheese. This sit for a few minutes before eating and I found the cheese gave the sauce a slight creaminess and it did thicken a bit. Using fresh veggies might have made the difference. Also I might consider cutting out about a third of the sausage.

The recipe, exactly as it is written, was fine. 

I will do some things different next time: 

1) Add garlic & onion in the last 3-4 minutes of simmering so that they retain their nutritional and antioxidant properties and so they don't reduce in flavor;

2) Use FRESH, MINCED spinach instead of frozen, and shredded. The frozen and shredded spinach seems to be messy to eat as it clumps; though it has a great flavor; and 

3) Add sea salt (or REAL SALT) to the recipe to enhance the flavor.

NOTE: Parmesan Cheese is NOT NECESSARY. This is a good tasting, healthy meal without it - although I love cheese.

ALSO, you can easily substitute Chicken/turkey sausages; these cook well, shorten cooking time, and have many different flavors to experiment with. 

IT was pretty good, quick, and easy to make.

I thought this was awesome! I was short on ingredients but had sausage (sweet), pasta and spinach. This was very comforting but still light. I chopped fresh spinach instead of frozen.

This took a lot of tweaking to give it enough flavor. I added more garlic, some sliced red pepper, a few mushrooms, some kalamata olives and quite a bit of ceyanne pepper. Next time I won't add entire can of broth it was too much.

This was delicious!  I made some modifications as follows based upon my family's preferences.  I sauteed mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes with mild Italian turkey sausage, and omitted the spinach.  I incrased the garlic to taste and added some coarsely chopped fresh parsely.  Finally, as one other reviewer noted, I added about 1 tbs of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up just a bit.  Came out fantastic!

Prepared dish exactly as stated. I would put this into my "4 times a year" category. Super quick and I had all the ingredients on hand. I would probably like a little more tomato so next time I'll add another can. Good mid week dinner option!

This recipe is delicious and so quick and easy. I use 1 lb of pasta, between 1 - 1.5 lbs of sausage, 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cans of diced tomato, with liquid. I then reduce the liquid quite a bit. Very scrumptious!

We loved this recipe. I used fresh spinach and a can of basil & oregano diced tomatoes. Instead of spicy sausage I used cheese and parsley Italian sausage. I took sausage out of the casings and crumbled. I also used fresh spinach as other reviewers suggested. I will be making this again and again.

This was excellent.  The only change I made while cooking was I used fresh spinach.  It makes a lot so the next day when reheating I added a pinch of cayenne and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  It was even better the next day!  This one is definately a keeper!

Exceptional dish!  I used spicy turkey sausage (no pork on my fork).  Because I didn't season my food like I normally would, it was a little bland so salt was definately needed.  Next time, I'll adjust it by sauteing the onions/garlic beforehand, and seasoning the sausage according to my taste (garlic and onion powder, seasoned salt, oregano, parsley, and red pepper flakes), and add fresh spinach (instead of frozen).

Made as written (subbing fresh spinach for frozen) and this was fantastic--my bf is NOT a sausage fan, but he was blown away and asked that this be made again (and soon!)

One of my favorite past a recipes. Was just looking at this as I think I will make tonight. I try to cook "healthier" 85% of the time so I usually make with chicken italian sausage (and throw a little white wine in as well.)  I also make with ronzoni smart taste pasta (the only higher fiber pasta I can stand). With the chicken sausage and healthier pasta this isn't really a bad dish from a health standpoint, as long as you keep your portion in check. It's really easy and everyone likes it (sausage? pasta? cheese? what's not to like??). Definitely a winner.

You can't go wrong on this one. For a healthier option, try using turkey Italian sausage. Excellent weeknight meal.

Good recipe...I think next time I'll either use fresh spinach or I will thaw the frozen spinach and squeeze it dry.  This is a good recipe for those who are lactose intolerant (if you omit the Parmesan cheese).   It's always a good sign when my husband says he'd have this dish again.  :)

Very good even cold. Needs a bit of salt. I also added another tablespoon of olive oil when I mixed pasta together with sausage mixture.

Yummy! I threw this together with what I had on hand, so I used precooked turkey dinner sausage instead of raw and broccoli instead of spinach. I sautéed the onions in olive oil first, then added the cubed sausage and garlic. I was concerned there would be too much liquid, so (as another reviewer suggested) I put the frozen broccoli in the colander first, poured the pasta water over it to cook it, then set it aside until the last minute of cooking the sauce. My kids and hub loved it - HELLO pasta and sausage! This will definitely be going into the rotation.

I made this for my family and they loved it. My 4-year old ate it up without me having to tell her constantly to eat. That an A+ in my book. Husband also loved it, he even had seconds. I didn't have spinach on hand, so I left it out and it was still great. Recipe is being added to my recipe rotation. A true keeper.

I enjoyed this but made it much lighter by using hot italian chicken sausage (only 3.5 grams of fat per serving).  Used fresh basil and spinach.  I'm sure that fresh tomatoes would be great.  A quick tasty healthy dinner.

Eating this as I type...wow, this is awesome!  What a way to clean out the crisper drawer (which is what I was looking to do!).  The only modification I made was I added some sliced zucchini and red bell pepper...and the sausage I was using was garlic sausage...I just added a healthy dose of red pepper flakes to the mix...I also used the whole pound box of penne...I hate having a small amount left in the box, but that's just me. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!!

We enjoyed this, but I did have to add salt.  I used "hot" Italian Sausage, but it still seemed to need an extra kick.  Salt helped, but next time I may add Rotel instead of regular canned tomatoes (I actually used Fire Roasted Tomatoes this time).  Added extra parmesan to the plated servings and served along with a caesar salad.  I'll definitely make again with a couple changes.

I really liked this.  My husband, though, not so much.  I used a tube of Italian sausage and also ground round.  I did use fresh spinach.  Reheated very well the next day for lunch.  I will make this again.

Really delicious! I just made a few alterations. I used a bag of fresh spinach and spicy Italian flavored chicken sausage from Trader Joe’s so it probably came out a little less flavorful than if I used pork sausage. To make it less bland, I added some salt, fresh pepper, and crushed red pepper and that fixed it in a pinch. I also added a can of white kidney beans.

Loved it! Easy to make and substitutions won't hurt. I used Apple & Gouda Cheese Chicken Sausage instead of Italian. I also used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and I thought I ruined it, but everybody in my family liked it just fine.

I thought this recipe looked great so I gave it a try. I was however concerned about all the juice that this recipe required but I sort of cut down on the chicken broth. I used about 1/2 the can instead of the whole can. Added salt to taste and used frozen spinach and served with garlic bread. This is a great recipe and I will be making this many more times to come!! Hubby liked it so its a keeper!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

Loved this. Easy and delicious. I suggest substituting sundried tomatoes for canned. Spectacular!

This is delicious!  I did make some tweaks (doesn't everyone?), using whole wheat pasta, sundried tomatoes instead of diced, and also sprinkling some goat cheese on top along with the parmesan.  LOVE it!!

This was really good!  I love sausage and spinach together, and I'm always on the hunt for a new good pasta recipe.  Here are the few things I changed just for personal preferences and what I had on hand:
1.  sweet, Italian turkey sausage out of casings
2.  petit diced tomatoes w/garlic & olive oil
3.  added UNCOOKED pasta to sauce & simmered   til done to our liking (al dente here!)
4.  bag fresh spinach folded in at end.
I also added salt and crushed red pepper.  It was delicious!  Picky husband loved it too.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This was so fun and delicious to make...my husband wanted a pasta with sausage, and when I stumbled across this I was pleasantly suprised.  I substuited all the vegetables with fresh stuff...plus some yellow, green bell pepper, and a red onion, with cherry tomotoes (I love a colorful meal:) and it was amazing!!  I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

Loved the flavor, added a little red pepper flakes, next time think I'll add 1/2 cup broth with 1/4 cup corn starch to thicken it up a little.  For sure will make again, simple, hearty, comfort food dish, great flavor.

this was great...I bought some strange looking pasta curls..just because.  Anyways my husband and I bothed agreed this recipe was a keeper.  The only edit I made was to thaw the spinach next time.  Leftovers were awesome too!

I thought this was very good.  But I wanted it creamy so I threw in an 8oz block of cream cheese at the end.  Also, I used fresh spinach (it's what I had on hand) and it worked just fine.

I beg my husband to pack a lunch for work as a means to save money, but he never does. After making this dish tonight for dinner, he asked me to pack a seperate container of leftovers for him to take to work.  That told me loud and clear that this dish is a keeper !

One word of warning - this is what I call an "everything at once" recipe. Do all your prep work before you start, because you basically have everything going at once, and no time to prep the next step while you're cooking (unless you're a better multitasker than I !).

I made this last night for my family. The ONLY substitution I made was using Turkey Cheddar Sausage instead of Italian Sausage to reduce overall calories and fat. It smelled fantastic and was amazing. It was simple and everyone loved it. It has enough "man flavor" for the guys, smelled great, and enough nutrition to please us women!

I was skeptical about this recipe due to the low amount of ingredients and ended up pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it!  I followed the recipe with some exceptions due to not having some items. I didn't use any spinach as I didn't have any in the house. I use chicken base when I cook so I used that instead of the broth.  Also, I used Hunt's tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic.  I still added the amount of garlic and basil called for in the recipe.  The sauce was yummy. It had great flavor and was super easy to make. I will definately keep a pound of sausage in the house just in case I need a quick meal.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Quick and Delicious.  I used whole wheat pasta.  Cooked it less than alDente and let it finish cooking in the sauce, once the sauce was finished and reduced.  The pasta absorbed the flavors of the sauce nicely as it finished cooking.

This dish was yummmy!!  It had lots of flavor and was a nice change from all the "regular" pasta recipes that are out there.  The only change I made was that I made it with ground sauage with sage added to it, just because the kidos wouldn't go for the hot sausage.

Hubby liked it--but we did leave out the spinach. (None on hand)  He is not a tomato lover, and this had an acceptable level of tomato for him.  I like this as a great "cupboard" meal.  I have almost all these ingredients all the time.  Update--even with spinach it was now acceptable.  I don't know if this an evolution of my Hubby or a reflection of the wonder of the recipe.  I did leave out the broth (on purpose) and the Parmesan (on accident).  The Parmesan would have been good.  I see no reason to add the broth in.

We followed this recipe to a T, and didn't care for it much at all. It was edible, but we would not call it delicious by any means. The HEAVY liquid participants (stock, tomato juice), make for a soggy dish that tends to have little flavor (despite the fact we used homemade stock)  and and wash the sausage flavor all over eveything. The spinach is completely useless included in this recipe—we never tasted it once. Note that we also used homemade pasta too, which really helps any recipe like this one. One family member liked it more than the others in this household, but we all agreed this recipe is very ho-hum and we will not make it again.

Very good and lite, used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Think I'll use mild or sweet sausage or a combo of half spicy and half mild sausage next time.

Very good and easy to make.  We didn't have frozen spinach, so I used fresh spinach and just cooked it for about a minute in the liquid with the other ingredients.  Came out very good.  4 stars because my 7 year old didn't like it, but my 5 year old did.

Great light twist on a classic dish of pasta and Italian sausage. The dish floats on the richness of the chicken stock and freshness of the diced tomatoes. It This was delicious and easy.  I will make this again

I subsituted the sausage with chicken and added an extra clove of garlic.  It was delicious and even better as leftovers two days later!  Will use Italian sausage next time.  Definitely a keeper!!!

I enjoyed it and had extra left over.  I recommend carmelizing the onions before adding the sausage.  Some people like my husband deal with onions better if they are a little sweeter like carmelizing does.

While I love the recipe - there are a few changes I made. 1.) Drain the sausage - dont need the added fat. 2.) Whole Wheat Pasta and a 1/4 cup milled flax seed!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I used a little over a pound of hot Italian sausages which I removed from their casings, crumbled and browned in a skillet before adding the onion and garlic. I did not use the oil since several reviews seemed to indicate it wasn't needed, and I concur. I then also added 8 oz. of sliced fresh mushrooms to sautee in the skillet before adding the broth and tomatoes. Since so many reviews said it was too soupy, I let mine reduce down a lot, but I think I overdid it as it had almost no broth when I mixed with the pasta. I used a pound of cooked angel hair (vermicelli) broken in half and that worked great. My kids thought the dish was too spicy so they wouldn't eat it. Next time I'll try mild sausage and just heat up the adult's dishes with dried red pepper flakes so the kids can eat it too. This recipe tasted a LOT like a soup I make called Rustic Italian Tortellini Soup that I got off another recipe website so I think next time I may try adding some cream and/or other herbs to change up the taste a little. Since the kids didn't eat any, we have lots of leftovers, but they will definitely be eaten and enjoyed. This is a tasty, fairly easy dish and it gets a solid 4.5 from my husband and me. Thanks!

This dish was excellent, a bit watering but really great!!!  I did change a couple of things, I did use 5 cloves of garlic and use shallots and onions and for the can of dice tomatoes I used Rotel original.

Wonderful and easy. Added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. Even my daughter liked this--and she usually only eats her spinach raw. Next time, I will reduce this liquid a bit more before adding the spinach. Do add the spinach shortly before serving so that you can enjoy the full contrast of bright green against red tomato chunks.) We like the petit dice kind, by the way.)

Very easy recipe with great flavour.  I added a few crushed chilies to the sausage while cooking and used fresh spinach.  I let it reduce longer than 5 mins before adding the pasta in response to other reviews.  Definately will make again!  Thanks for sharing.

I know I'm in the minority - but my husband and I really didn't like this.  Made it as written - thought it was terrible then checked out the recipe again to see what others had done to jazz it up.  I added everything I could except cream cause didn't have any.  We ate it for dinner.

My family LOVES this dish!  My husband and oldest son are very picky eaters and don't normally like spinach.  They both raved about how good this was and both went back for seconds!  It's super easy to make and tastes even better the second day!  Thanks Tammy!

Great recipe when you are pressed for time. I removed the sausage from the caseing. Next time I will drain the grease. I used fresh basil instead of dried about 3-4 leaves chopped, used mild sausage for the sake of my 5yr old and fresh spinach. Turned out great. My son didn't even notice the spinach.

This was good but I thought it was a little salty.  I think the chicken broth plus the parmesan cheese might have been the cause.  I would probably make again but might not use the chicken broth.

This was wonderful.  I liked it so much I wanted to share it with everyone so I posted it on my Facebook.  I used Hot Italian Sausage as my hubby and I like a little bite.  This is fast, easy and great tasting.  I will use this many times over, even for company with a salad and loaf of crunchy Italian Bread.  Nothing could be better.

Made this dish tonight using rotini pasta and half a pound of sausage I'd meant to use on pizza but hadn't. It was delicious—a big hit with my daughter and my wife. I used frozen spinach per the recipe but added a handful of fresh basil from my wife's garden, chopped not too fine.  Served with white wine and a Caesar salad. Terrific dinner that I'll be making again.

I give this recipe 5 stars.  It's really flavourful.    Except I went by the advice of others and added some extra salt.  WRONG choice!  I used beef OXO packets instead of canned broth and its so salty to begin with.  My meal turned out SUPER salty.  :( I'm going to add some more tomato and noodles in hopes of de-salting a bit.  Definitely don't add more salt to the meal.  If you want more, add it to your own plate in the end!  Better not enough than too much!!!

Great meal for the family, everyone liked it, even my picky eater!  Other recipes like this have the heavy cream I was glad to find this recipe using the ls chicken broth instead.

Fantastic, light sauce with tons of flavor, great color and plate appeal. Two dishes to wash doesn't hurt either. The only change I made was to use fresh basil instead of dried because I had one and not the other. My fiance' proclaimed it "resturaunt quality" as she devoured a plate of it. Quick, easy, delicious, made with common ingredients, pretty and light. This one is going into our regular rotation. Thanks Tammy for a great recipe.

I thought the sauce was a little thin, but overall had good flavor!  I used pork sausage, but I think I will use turkey sausage next time to cut back on the fat.

When I read the recipe, it seemed like it had great potential.  After eating it, however, I was disappointed to find that it was bland and watery.  Even worse, the leftovers smell awful!  I was not impressed.

Good, basic recipe!  I used whole-wheat pasta and I really liked it.  I also added some mozz. cheese at the end, which in my opinion never hurts :)  I only had a 16oz. package of frozen spinach, so I used that and it came out beautifully (but we really like spinach.)  I used turkey sausage, as well, and used 1 1/2 lbs because I needed to use some up.  All in all, fantastic dinner and I can't wait for the leftovers at lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is excellent and super easy to make.  Kids loved it to.  Variations: I didn't have any chicken broth, so I used vegetable broth. Instead of spinach, I used asparagus, and just left covered for another 15 minutes after simmering time expired.  After I drained the pasta, I put in back in the hot cooking pot, added cheese, sauce, stirred and left covered for 15 minutes until we were ready to eat.  Awesome.

This was really good and super easy.  I used mild italian sausage and rigatoni pasta and stuck to the recipe as stated, it turned out wonderful.  Big hit with the family, I'll make it again without a doubt!

This was okay, nothing that knocked my socks off.  If you're going to make this, add fresh spinach and fresh basil -- that should add better flavor to it.  Also, adding sliced sauteed mushrooms might help.

Very good!  Used a whole pound of pasta and some romano cheese (along with the parm.) and it turned out great.  Also stewed tomatos, not diced.  Only had mild italian sausage, but added some dried red peppers (next time I'll add more!).  Canned spinach worked just as well as frozen.

I used Turkey Sausage and canned spinch because that is what I had on hand. Wonderful! However, Turkey sausage requires a bit more oil. I can't wait to try it again, I ate it as leftovers all week.

To this great recipe, I added 300 grams of ground meat and I used a jar of marina sauce from Trader joe´s because their sauces are really tasty. This is comfort food for my family.

I tripled this and it was a home run with the family and a bunch of the kids friends.  Young adults.  I may substitute one can of tomato sauce for one of the diced tomato cans that the recipe calls for to change the final consistency.

Delicious, I added 12 ounces of thawed shrimp near end and fresh basil.  I first sautéed sausage and drained, used whole wheat non-drained penne pasta, everything else was the same.  I added fresh grated Parmesan cheese at the end, adding this to my regular recipes. Thank you!

Ok so I happened to have some spicy italian sausage in my fridge that was about to expire, so I’m like, I have to cook this!  But i dont want to go thru the labor of lasagna and chili wasn’t sounding the best. So I searched and found this recipe which I had saved prior but never made. Voila’! I had basically everything I needed. But let me tell you, although I read the great reviews, I never expected it to be THAT GOOD! But it was indeed, THAT GOOD!  I was worried my daughter wouldn’t eat it because of the spicy but she had two big helpings!  As did I....yikes. Two too big of helpings. Lol but it was amazing. The main changes I made were the pasta.... I used gluten free garden style pagodas.  We eat mostly gf here and I didn’t have penne anyways. I also got lucky and had a box of organic frozen spinach in the freezer. As per the instructions, I just plopped the frozen rectangle into the sauce and sure enough, it cooked up perfectly.

Very good! Sauce is very thin but tastes yummy. I used a fresh bag of baby spinach instead of frozen. My husband likes meat so next time I'll probably add a little less pasta so the sausage ratio is higher instead of opening another package of sausage. I added to my recipe box :)

I thought this was really good although I would not say great but I take responsibility for that.  I did not have hot sausage, only mild so I added crushed red pepper.  I also didn't have fresh or frozen spinach, I used canned.  I needed to add salt (about 1/2 tsp) but I think it needed other spices as well.  Mine was really soupy too so I added some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce which worked well.  It was a good recipe...don't get me wrong...I just think it needed something more.  I didn't want to downgrade my review since I may have messed it up.  I think you are better off following this recipe to a "T".

We really like this recipe. It was a nice surprise to us when we found it. The only change we make is that we use fresh spinach instead of frozen

I made this dish for dinner tonight.   I did make a few changes because I am on a diet, therefore I swapped sweet potatoes with the pasta.   I didn’t have chicken broth on hand so I used beef broth (50% lower sodium).   It was delicious,  thank you for posting this recipe I will be making this often.

It's been a favorite for years and tops in my rotation, thank you!  I modify seasonally for fresh vs. frozen/canned/dried (tomoatoes, spinach and basil.)  I leave the sausage in links, cook, and slice into smaller pieces to save work.  Use the sausage cooking liquid as part of the broth.  I even make a vegetarian version for my daughter.  A home ruin!

Incredibly easy and delicious.  I used chopped fresh baby spinach instead of frozen as that's what we had, and used mild Italian sausage put of preference. Awesome.  Even fussy daughter had seconds.

The way the frozen spinache breaks down in the end is always great. I love to add extra Parmesan and sometimes extra chicken stock to make it more soupy.

It was pretty good.  I am not a good recipe follower and I was only cooking for two so I took liberties with the quantities.  I had turkey sausage, whole wheat rotini, diced tomatoes with green chilies, and fresh spinach.  My husband, who is not a big fan of pasta, thought it was pretty tasty--and it had nice zing.I may try it again.

I just made this for Father's Day dinner. It was simple, flavorful and everyone enjoyed it. I did have to use sweet sausage but other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely. I microwaved the spinach first so I could squeeze out the liquid because I was concerned it would make the sauce too runny. Added a splash or so of white wine but other than that made it as is and would definitely make it again.

Substituted Walmart brand of tomatoes w green chili’s. Because that’s what I had. No spinach either so sliced in a yellow squash. Took advice of writer of recipe and dumped pasta into sauce and mixed. Delish.

I made this for dinner last night and the family really liked it.  I cut pasta to 1/2 pound and added 1 can of cannelini beans, drained and rinsed.  I also skipped the onion and added a medium sized red bell pepper, sliced into 1 inch strips to match the penne pasta.  I am all for making healthy swaps that increase the protein and veg in a recipe!  Next time, I may try to add more broth and cook the pasta in the same pot so that it absorbs more of the flavor.

I made the following changes and it was a hit!...
In a large skillet, heat oil, sausage and onions; cook through until sausage is no longer pink. Once the sausage is almost cooked,  add garlic to skillet. Add broth, basil and tomatoes with liquid.
Cook over medium heat to reduce and cook pasta. When pasta is almost cooked, add chopped spinach; cover skillet and simmer on reduced heat until spinach is tender.
Sprinkle with lots of cheese and serve immediately.    
                         
I think I will try fresh basil and spinach next time but dried basil and frozen spinach worked just fine!

Used mild Italian sausage and added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Used fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, dried oregano, dried marjoram and salt and pepper. Doubled garlic and spinach.  Added splash of red wine.  Simmered on low extra time - turned out amazingly delicious!

I used 12 oz sausage, increases the noodles to 1 lb, added a 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes, used 12 oz fresh spinach, and finished with 1 cup fat free half and half. I should have waited a little longer to add the cooled noodles and let it simmer longer with the fresh spinach. The leftovers I was going to take to work, were polished off by my 12 yr old as a late night snack.

This was really good. Next time I will try adding more veggies,  maybe mushrooms, zucchini or bell peppers.

This recipe I have made many times. Love it love it !! Lighter sausage pasta recipe and sooo tasty ! I double the recipe when I make it because a single batch isn’t enough. I also used  fresh spinach, but have done both.

This recipe was so easy to make and my entire family loved it (it's really hard to get a universal approval from my family!).  They loved it enough that my son took in leftovers and ate that instead of school lunch for three days in a row.  I didn't make any changes and it was perfect.

I love this recipe as is! The second time I made I had no spinach so I used frozen peas and I used a little cornstarch and half half to make roux and added red wine.  My sausage wast spicy enough so I added red pepper flakes. It was just as delicious as the original!   I gave 5 stars for the original and 5 for the way I made it the second time.  I like to see variations of recipe in case I don’t have some of the ingredients it calls for.  Definitely one of our favorites!

I added tomato paste, red wine, and then a little honey to cut through the acidity. I also simmered it for an hour to reduce down and added fresh basil, adamame beans, and a knob of butter when combining the sauce with the pasta.

This was a nice little weeknight dish. Added a little chopped Italian parsley and a slice of garlic bread on the side and it was a winner. As always, I make every recipe as written before I try to make changes. Just as written, this is a delicious dish.

After cooking the sausage I added the garlic & onion and fried them up a bit before adding the liquids

After simmering sauce for 5 minutes, I thought it looked a little thin so I added a spoonful of tomato paste. Another review wrote salt was needed; mine tasted fine, perhaps because of the tom paste. 

Very easy and tasty. I like recipes that have the protein & veg in one dish so you don’t need to make 2 separate. Next time may add sliced mushrooms.

We loved this recipe. It's flexible.  I was lacking a few  ingredients. So, substituted freshly chopped cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, and a half jar of store- bought Marinara  sauce. It was wonderful.

I cooked the pasta in the chicken broth separate, no need to drain then poured the finished meat mixture in the pot with the pasta, mixed in the cheese. Oh my goodness. This meal was so fast to make and tastes AMAZING!!

This was both delicious and simple! I used hot Italian turkey sausage and instead of frozen spinach, I put fresh spinach in a colander and drained my pasta over it. There was definitely too much liquid; I had to boil a lot of it away. Next time I may try to omit the broth altogether.

Great, easy weeknight dinner. I used Hot Italian sausage, and I also used whole wheat pasta and low sodium chicken broth to make it a little healthier. As another reviewer suggested, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. My 11 year old loved it so much and asked to please put this recipe in regular rotation.

Just made this for the first time tonight.  I made it exactly as written but did add a small can of mushrooms and a small can of marinara sauce based on other reviews.  It was just okay for me.  Very easy but just an okay meal.  Other reviews talk about adding some heavy cream and other veggies...that might have kicked it up a notch.  Fresh veggies and fresh mushrooms might be good additions if you’re thinking about making this.

My kids are picky about dinner and rarely really like what I make. This dinner changed all of that! They  BOTH gave this a thumbs up! One daughter doesn't like tomatoes so we left them out. Also didn't have Italian sausage so we used bacon. SO delicious and EASY & quick to make.

Wonderful weeknight supper.  Followed the recipe except that I used half hot and half sweet Italian sausage.  It was a very light and tasty pasta dish with just the right amount of heat.  Loved it.  Might like to try it with fresh spinach or Arugula next time.

I added red bell pepper and mushrooms.  Instead of spinach I used Kale because that's all I had.
My family loves this recipe.  Its much like the "American Chop Suey" my mom makes.  This is a real comfort dish in our house.

This will be a regular for the family.  Went with lower sodium broth and kale instead of spinach, as well as high protein pasta.  Everyone loved it.  Next time will try more tomatoes / less broth, as the kids asked for "more tomatoes," but I suspect I'll prefer tonight's way.

I followed the recipe closely, using sweet Italian sausage.  I substituted broccoli only because I had no spinach, and added 1/2 small can of tomato paste to thicken toward the end of the cooking time.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  It was velvety and delicious.  I didn’t add any salt.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very easy. I used regular sausage but insteadnof plain canned tomatoes I used the  canned tomatoes with habanero peppers because that is what I had available Great kick! My husband loved it. It was so flavorful. We will make this again!

We thought it was great.  Added a little bit of salt and simmered it for quite a bit longer to thicken it up.  In the future I would likely use half as much broth and leave the tomato juice out.

I was so pleasantly surprised with this dish. Very flavorful and will definitely make again. Kids have asked for it to be put into "the rotation." I too used fresh spinach instead of frozen. The sauce really is more of a broth but still very tasty.

I made as written except used fresh spinach instead of frozen since that was what I had on hand.  I used the majority of a 5 oz container of fresh.  This was very tasty and enjoyed by my husband, son and a visitor.  It was very easy to throw together, but in my opinion almost seemed like it needed more sauce.  It was quite watery and the proportions seemed a little off, as it seemed like there was a lot of pasta for the amount of sauce.  I almost wonder if it couldn't benefit from another can of tomatoes and then possibly some cornstarch to try and thicken it up a bit.

I loved the flavor combination, but I felt the sausage was too chopped up.  I would have liked it more if it were like mini meatballs where there was more substance to the meal.  Still a keeper.

This is good, and simple to make. Of course we made a few changes...added mushrooms, bell pepper, and a little crushed red pepper. We also let it cook down longer than 5 minutes, and  it turned out great!

This was delicious. Didn't follow the recipe exactly, but close enough to give it 5 stars. Only changes I made was to omit the spinach (not a fan) and add a can of drained northern beans, which thickened it a bit. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe and make this quite often.  The only modifications that I make is to use a lot less chicken broth and I use fresh spinach.  I don't like having a lot of sauce for this dish.

Excellent. It was better than expected and then some. I used mild Italian sausage and fresh spinach. I did feel it was a bit soupy so I did use a little cornstarch to thicken up to stew like liquid. It was so good I drank the extra broth in my bowl. I will be sending this to others

This recipe was great for a Monday night. I used real parmesan and grated parmesan after it was done. I also did not use spicy Italian sausage, I used regular par cooked sausage, and pan fried it with the vegetables before adding the pasta. I also added crushed red pepper so it could be a little spicy, since I did not use the spicy Italian sausage. It worked out great, we loved the lightness and the overall taste of the dish. I will be making this again.

I made it using a couple of the suggestions from other reviewers: use a bag of fresh spinach, and fresh basil. I added the fresh basil and spinach at the end of cooking, let the spinach wilt completely and then added the cooked pasta. The only thing I will do next time is chop the fresh baby spinach a bit. It's a great easy recipe.

Made this tonight.  I thickened the sauce with alittle cornstarch/water mix and that coated the pasta better.  The dish was very tasty.  It was very salty, even for someone who likes salty foods as I do.  Next time I will use a 10 oz can of chicken broth with 4 oz of water.  Overall a winner.  My honey loved it.

I have made this twice now and  it is a huge hit in our home; the 2nd time was for 12 teenage boys who were here to watch a game without much notice so I needed to throw something together quickly.  I have tried the recipe once with sweet Italian sausage  and the 2nd time with spicy; would definitely stick with spicy.  I do agree with other reviews that it lacks a bit of flavor as written, which is easily correctable to taste with seasonings.  I also use fresh spinach and would recommend cooking the pasta just shy of al dente and then adding it to the sausage mixture in step 4 to allow it to finish cooking with the pasta, absorbing the flavor and excess moisture.  This recipe is a keeper and worth toying with until you get it the way your crowd will love it.  Thank you for sharing!

The only changes made was I cut back on the amount of onion and garlic because of a family members preference otherwise I would have left as written.  Also, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and forgot to add the parmesan cheese which I didn't miss but  will definitely add next time.  It was a delicious meal whether served warm or at room temperature.

This was great.  It has potential for altering the flavour by using different herbs and spices, which is what I love about recipes in general.

Not sure what went wrong with this recipe but hubby & I only ate enough to stave off hunger and then we dumped the rest into the garbage.  It just wasn't good. The texture was off and there was virtually no taste to anything but the pasta.  I didn't change anything from the written directions so I'm stumped as to why it is not worth repeating for us but worthy of such high praise from so many others.

This dish was amazing. The only thing I did different was I used half a can of chicken broth instead of the whole can. I took other reviewers advice and used fresh spinach instead of frozen and poured the pasta water over the spinach to cook it. Don't be nervous when you see a lot of liquid in the pan, as it will reduce while simmering.  Also the pasta will absorb some of the juice.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe exactly as written. I've also been making it with onion and red and green peppers with spicy sausage for a different dish, no spinach.  Almost any type sausage and vegetable combination works well. This is versatile, easy and always a winner.

Wow!! This is a keeper at my house!! Made as directed with the exception that I used 1 bag of fresh baby spinach. Chopped it up and threw it in the last few minutes. I will use 2 bags next time. My young son liked it as well (he only had the pasta with the sauce). My husband and parents loved it as well. For those reviewers who say the sauce is too thin, it's supposed to be a thin sauce - use rotini pasta - it holds the sauce in the spirals. Amazing recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I substitute frozen spinach with fresh baby arugula n some slivered fresh basil leaves to add some genuine Italian flavor. Use sweet sausage instead of spicy sausage to accommodate family members who do not take spice too well. I also enjoy putting in roasted pine nuts,n (optional )cayenne pepper flakes at beginning of cooking olive oil n garlic spice herb mixtures. Another truly Italian touch will be to add capered anchovies fillet into the oil /spice, herbs n cook till fragrant. Serve with roasted broccoli sprouts with truffled oil. 

 Buon Apetiti!

It was really good and filling. I changed it up just a bit. Used a whole box of pasta (16 oz.), 1 1/2 pounds of hot sausage and 2 1/2 cups of stock. Next time I'll add another jar of diced tomatoes.

I have made this twice, first time it was perfect, second time, it was too watery.  If you add extra veggies, it will soak up all the liquid, so that's what I will do from now on.  It was very tasty.

Very delicious and very easy to make. Whole family loved it. Very light but filling for those who don't normally do Italian because of the heaviness.

I did make some slight changes, regular sausage, fresh spinach,  grape tomatoes, and a bunch of spices. This came out just like the Italian places make. Delicious .
Thank You for the recipe.

Pretty tasty.  It is fairly mild tasting apart from the spicy sausage I used.  I would recommend not dumping the tomato juice in, ends up being too much liquid, I could have served this as a soup.

Love this!  I used fresh baby spinach, red onion and mild sausage links. Omitted the cheese just trying to reduce dairy. I do recommend a low sodium chicken broth.  Amazing flavor and very easy!

I made this tonight and my family really enjoyed it.  I changed the following:  I used a little less chicken broth, frozen chopped spinach, added 1 tablespoon corn starch mixed a small amount of cold water and added it near the end. It came out flavorful and NOT watery at all.  I cooked it a bit longer on a higher heat.

I made this for dinner and it was a hit!!! My husband, 11 yo daughter, even my 4 yo son loved it!! I didn't put chicken stock but replaced it with chicken boullion (so it's not soupy). And instead of Italian sausage, I used pork kielbasa. I forgot to put the parmeasna cheese but it was still great!!!!

I love it when I can find a good recipe and make it vegetarian. I used vegetarian sausage and vegearian broth. I added a little more spice than what was listed here as well as some yellow and red sweet peppers. It was amazing.

Way too much broth. It came out like a soup almost. Next time I will use less broth and some more olive oil. I used light sausage so maybe that's why there wasn't a lot of oil to add to flavor.

Had to swap out fresh over dried Basil for pasta, 5 nice leaves chiffonade, added 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, 1/4 cup diced red pepper.  My kids loved it, very light yet refreshingly filling.

I was afraid this recipe would be bland, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely make it again as great weeknight dish for a cold rainy night. Just add bread and wine to top it off.  I liked this recipe because I knew my husband would love it. And he did! I read the most helpful reviews--the most positive sand the most negative--and made adjustments accordingly. I drained the canned tomatoes  plus cut the amount of broth used to 5 oz.  After cooking 3/4 lb. of pasta I ended up using maybe 1/2  lb. of it. I thought it was a better ratio, since my husband likes meatier meals. I also used fresh kale rather than frozen spinach because I had it. So I followed the most helpful positive review's tip of steaming the kale over the pasta for a couple minutes before adding to meat mixture.

I used half the amount of spinach, a can of mushrooms and a little corn starch to the broth because it was too thin.  It came out very good.  I will make it again.

This was a hit with the entire family including 4 kids age 9-4. The only things I did differently was I used fresh spinach added in at the end with the pasta, fresh roasted cherry tomatoes (I didn't have canned on hand but I think that would be just as good) and I added a little white wine and cream with a little cornstarch to thicken it up. So good!!

5 based on the actual recipe even!  This recipe walks that (less than) delicate balance of light and hearty at the same time.  Spinach, tomatoes, broth for light, and pasta and sausage to round out the hearty.  Based on comments, the only slight adjustment I made was to make about 10oz of broth (chicken base > canned broth).  Don't serve the pasta and mixture separately like you might do with spaghetti.  Mix it all together so the pasta absorbs some of the broth.  I did find frozen "cut leaf spinach" that is MUCH better than the brick of chopped spinach.  The tip about pouring the pasta water over the frozen spinach was awesome.  So easy, and tasty.  The wife isn't a big sausage fan, but liked this one a lot.

Good stuff. Made as described. I let everything simmer a bit longer than suggested. Don't forget the parm, it would be a bit bland without it.

This is almost like a comfort food to me! It's very good and easy!  I made it just like the recipe, but I used VegasLizas review recommendations and it came out perfectly!  I used fresh spinach and dried basil....I would've used fresh basil, but I didn't have any on hand.  Also, I used Bob Evans Italian sausage, so I may add some red pepper flakes the next time to add some heat.  My kids really liked this, too!

Great starter! I added stuff and freestyled it! As I cooked the sausage, I added the garlic, onions and a can of Rotel (that's all I had on hand). Then a little butter, chicken bouillon, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and a splash of ranch dressing to make things a little creamy. This "set" while I boiled the penne noodles. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I placed the spinach in the colander then poured the noodles over it.  Very happy with this newbie to our home ;)

This was wonderful! I doubled it for my family of seven. They took seconds and thirds and we had enough leftover for a couple of lunches the next day. We loved the spice to it. I followed the advice to put the spinach at the bottom of the colander and drain the pasta over it. You can use any kind of pasta with it.  I'll make this again for sure.

I did an ingredient search for chicken sausage and this recipe popped up.  I did everything exactly as the recipe stated, but used chicken, feta, spinach sausage.  WOW!  Unbelievably tasty!    My husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I made it my I used fresh spinach. It was very watery and didn't thicken up so I used a little corn starch.   I liked it but hubby wanted it creamy so with the leftovers I added a cream sauce and he  was happy. We will have it again.

I used fresh basil, fresh tomatoes and fresh spinach instead of what the original recipe called for.  I used the entire 16 oz. box of penne pasta and there was enough liquid.  I will make this again.

I made it without tomatoes and it was delicious! I used Italian sausages from trader joes and subbed in the tomato juice with chicken broth instead.

I made this tonight but I substituted canned tomatoes with fresh cherry tomatoes and substituted frozen spinach with fresh spinach. I also made my own chicken broth from chicken bouillon. Its was a delicious meal and will become our go to dish!

Delicious!!  I made exactly as stated, but used fresh spinach, and since I only had mild sausage, I added a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up (but next time will just use the spicy sausage).  It is a bit runny, so adding a little heavy cream wouldn't be a bad idea.  But it really was much better than I expected it to be and will definitely make this a regular.  It was only my husband and me, and it could have easily fed 4-6 people, with some nice garlic bread, but we'll enjoy the leftovers!

I hardly review recipes but I wanted to put in my 2 cents. I believe the bad reviews were because of the soupy sauce. This is how to reduce and thicken it. I made minor adjustments and it was very tasty, restaurant quality. I sautéed the onions and garlic first. After browning the sausage which I used sweet Italian I added 1 1/4 cup chicken broth. I used a hole can of diced tomatoes but I recommend using half. I used a handful of fresh basil. No need to add salt since salt in the sausage, broth and canned tomatoes. I did add 2 splashes of red wine and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it. I brought to a boil  and then covered, simmered for 30 min. Simmering dramatically reduces the sauce, not soupy at all. I added 2 large handfuls of fresh baby spinach and then added the cooked pasta, rigatoni. Buon appetito!

AMAZING! would not change a thing in terms of measurements.  We added diced chicken (cut the sausage in 1/2) sliced black olives and artichokes to it and Romano cheese on the top. SO GREAT!

Very tasty. I was afraid that it would be too soupy so I reduced the chicken broth amount to 8 oz. then for the tomatoes I used a can of Rotel. This was the perfect meal. I will make this one again.

I only made the recipe in desperation, to use up my sausage, and was astonished by how delicious it was. It was even yummier on the 2nd day. The only thing I would modify is it required a little extra time to boil the liquid down at end. It is now in my recipe box. Yum.

This was one of the best dishes I ever made...I made a few minor modifications... I used cheese filled tortellini, tomato basil chicken sausage, fresh cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh spinach, and added a few crimini mushrooms. I used 1/2 the chicken stock and the rest heavy cream.

It was easy! I followed everything except for the spinach. Since I'm not a big fan of it I just used a handful. The flavor was great and not overpowering. This will become a favorite! Loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I made this using ingredients I had already so it was slightly different but still very yummy.  Spaghetti, onion powder, garlic powder, cheese & garlic sausage, can of diced tomatoes, chicken broth, dried basil, flour to thicken, parm cheese, peas. The base recipe was extremely useful for tweaking so I didn't have to go to the store. Next time I will try the recipe as is. The left overs were eaten over rice.

This was good and easy to make.  I poured off the grease from the sausage before adding the other ingredients.   I used Kale from the garden (instead of spinach) and I reduced the chicken broth to about 3/4 of a cup.  I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste.  I added some salt and fresh ground pepper to the pot.

If I could give it 10 stars I would!! * * * * * * * * * *

I made this and it was really good. I didn't use the spicy sausage, but I used Costco flavored sausage. This worked well for my elderly parents that I cook for. They loved it. I might add black olives next time.

This was excellent! I used ground italian sausage and it was very nice. The only chane I made was I used fresh spinich and let the sauce simmer a little longer while the pasta finished.  Always looking for a different pasta dish and this is definite addition to your rotation of quick workday meals.

Easy and delicious! As other reviews mention that the liquid can be a lot. To fix this, I let the mixture cook after adding the tomatoes until it was almost gone. I did the same after adding the stock, but left a bit for the pasta to absorb. I also squeezed out my spinach. I used fresh basil, gently tossed in at the end. Great recipe!

It honestly was not as fabulous as these reviews made it seem.  I was expecting restaurant quality taste but it just tasted like borderline cafeteria food with some spices.  Also, this should be called Sausage Pasta Soup.  You need a bowl and spoon to eat this.  Do not plan on making this again.

Really good - had to make a few minor substitutions, but pretty minimal. I didn't have any Italian sausage so I thinly sliced up a package of apple chicken sausage links, sautéed them in a bit of olive oil until nicely browned, then removed them while sautéing the onion/garlic and liquids because I didn't want them sitting in the liquid. I used fresh spinach and Italian seasoning instead of basil because I didn't have any basil. I didn't want it to be super saucy so I made sure to let it reduce the liquids down until they were almost gone, then added the sausage and pasta and tossed it all together. Very good and versatile, thanks for the recipe!

I used left over chicken sausage with spinach in it that I got from Costco. I didn't have any fresh spinach to add but this was so quick and easy. I love this recipe!

It was super soupy and bland. 14.5 oz of chicken broth is excessive.

I thought this was great! I added some extra spices like cayenne, onion powder and sriracha.  I also added more spinach than the recipe called for.  It thickened up nicely and was delicous. Thanks for the recipe.

This was quick and very good - one persons who was eating didn't like spinach so I substituted for broccoli.  I added some olives too.  Will definitely make it again!

Delicious exactly as in the recipe. I did not find it to be too soupy as some commented. That may be a function of the type & size of pasta used. I used 3/4 lb of mini penne pasta. This makes a huge quantity for six servings!  Next time I may improve the carb to protein ratio by using less pasta and reducing the amount of broth. This is definitely a keeper.

I love this dish it is so easy to make...The modifications I used to enhance this dish was... instead of using regular diced tomatoes I used Diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano already cooked into them with made a HUGE difference...I used frozen spinach but they were the leafy kind in a bag and not the one in the box...I also added Half and Half rich and creamy kind for a creamy sauce ??? for the sausage I used the hot and spicy sausage you can get in any grocery store but left on the casing...I cook them on the stove until they are almost burnt and have cracked open, once that happens I cut them like  a hot dog toss them back into the pan and add all the other stuff to it...once plated I throw on some Cilantro and I am in heaven ???soooooo gooooood!!! YUMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOO

We loved it! The only thing is that the sauce doesn't reduce much so I would make a full pound of pasta instead of the 3/4 it says to make.... Also if you like a little extra spice, I added crushed red pepper flakes while cooking

Easy pasta dish. I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. I added a little wine after cooking the sausage,onions and garlic. I also used halved fresh grape tomatoes instead of the canned and fresh spinach as well. Utilized the GREAT suggestion of another reviewer to cook the spinach by putting it in the colander and draining the pasta over it. Who knew! Also added heavy cream to get a little creamier sauce. All in all a good dish!

Delish! I ended up subbing sweet sausage for spicy (already had it), and used zucchini instead of spinach (mostly because I forgot to thaw the spinach), and it was sooo yummy!  Will definitely make again. I did add less broth and let it reduce while the pasta cooked so it was a good consistency for us.

My substitutions:  sausage with hot turkey sausage, regular noodles with veggie rotini and frozen spinach with  fresh spinach.  I also cooked the spinach with the noodles.  I made the mistake of cooking noodles first, it took a while for the broth to reduce so the noodles got a little soft but was still delicious!  I did spice the turkey sausage as it was browning but this was definitely an easy recipe, made me look like a good chef!! Easy healthy pasta dish!

Oh, my!  This was sooooo good!   And such a nice surprise of flavor by using the chicken broth.  I ended up doubling the quantity of chicken broth since the pasta really absorbs so much.  I used Italian sweet sausage since the hot sausage is too spicy for my kids, and it was great.  I can only guess that the use of hot sausage would give the flavor some extra zing.  But this is perfect as-is.

Based on the reviews, I added 14.5 ounces of heavy whipping cream and doubled the recipe because I have a larger family. I also added a frozen package of the 3- pepper blend, Kroger brand. The family really enjoyed the recipe. I have added this one to my recipe collection. 

NOTE: Next time, I will remove the casing from the sausage. Trying to chew that was annoying.

I will try this again with a few modifications.  Definitely fresh spinach.  I removed the sausages casing and crumbled it.  I also drained the sausage because it just looked to greasy for me as I have a sensitive stomach but I think that's what gives if the flavor mine lacked.

I've made this many times now and we love it! It's simple and very tasty. For the reviewer who said it was too soupy - make sure to squeeze out the excess water from the frozen spinach.  I make it as written and it's a regular now for us.

This was good and I did use fresh spinach.  I found the sauce did not reduce much so it was soupy but I tossed the pasta in with everything so it was absorbed.  Everyone liked it  but I'll definitely read more reviews before making it again to see if I can make it better.  There will be a next time!

Followed to the letter the first time and loved it!  Since then I have changed it slightly and cook the onion and garlic with the sausage.  I also use fresh spinach - otherwise, no changes and family cannot eat it fast enough!  My only recommendation is to make extra.

I did what another post suggested and cooked the (fresh) spinach in the colander as I drained the noodles. I used 5 hot Italian sausages, and removed the casings. Rigatoni. Less than a full can of broth, whole canned tomatoes and all the juices from it. I also added a can of dark kidney beans, drained and rinsed, to the sausage mix. I used dried basil because I didn't have any fresh on hand, it was ok but I bet fresh is better.  Overall it was great but the meijer brand sausage had a sweet taste too it that we didn't care for, and not as hot as the johnsonville Italian sausage. This will be added to our family recipes!

My husband and I loved this dish. I used hot Italian turkey sausage, drained the tomatoes, used half of the broth and mixed in veggie style corkscrew pasta and it was so good.  I will be cooking this often.

I wish the sauce was a little thicker, I added orange, yellow, and green bell peppers... Overall it's okay, I've had better though

Delicious! Made it with homemade penne pasta and hot chicken sausage from Sprouts and it was a huge hit.

Used diced tomatoes with rosemary and oregano, omitting the  basil.  Drained the liquid from the tomatoes and added one cup of red wine.

I just finished eating this and it was great! I like to use fresh ingredients if I have then on hand so I used grape tomatoes (halved lengthwise) and fresh spinach. I also used basil fresh from my windowsill. The meal came together in the time that it took to cook the pasta. A sprinkle of grated chees and voila, dinner! My kids even went back for seconds. Definitely a "make again". And if you are a "point" counter, the meal calculated to be 12 points a serving. Hope this helps.

This has become a staple recipe in our house now for some time. I make it at least once per month. Highly recommend either spinach or broccoli, but there are many ways to make this with all sorts of veggies. I added green pepper, onion and celery almost every time. I use the green, orange veggie pasta, or whole wheat pasta instead of plain ziti or the like to add more nutrition. Also, I recommend you chop up the sausage into bite-size or smaller pieces, or use ground sausage that falls apart easily, because my family tends to pick out all the sausage and the leftovers hardly have any! It is like a stew or a soup, so do serve it in a bowl and add parm or romano cheese on top at the table, not in the cooking pot.

This was delicious! I have 3 sport playing teens so I doubled the sausage, tomatoes and fresh spinach and increased broth slightly.  Mixed with a pound of brown rice penne.  So good! I did put in some salt and pepper to taste.

This was a simple recipe with good results.  I read other reviews about it turning out "soupy", and I would have to agree.  I personally prefer thicker pasta sauces, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  My husband didn't seem to mind that it was a thick sauce, so it's all preference.  The overall taste was good.  I used a mild sausage just in case my kids end up trying it.  I would like to try it again with a spicier sausage and shredded cheese.  I may also add a few more ingredients to thicken the sauce next time.

Excellent and very easy. I followed the recipe as is with 2 minor changes: 
1. I browned the sausage and drained it, then added it to the onions and garlic when they were cooked.
2. I dropped the spinach in the boiling water with the pasta when it had 1 minute left to cook. Drained it all in the colander and then returned it to the pasta pot, then mixed the sauce through it.

I'll definitely make this again!

Quick, easy, and delicious, a nice change from my family's go-to quick & easy pasta w/Ragu.  A bit too liquidy on first day, but perfect on second day.  Followed recipe exactly on first time (rated 4 based on exact recipe) and did not like the chicken flavor from the broth.  Next time, I used vegetable (or beef?) broth and preferred that.  I have made with fresh spinach and with frozen spinach -both good.

We thought it was good. Used brown rice pasta and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Both worked just fine. When I made it a  second time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was way too soupy. Will stick with fresh spinach.

Only change I made was  I only cooked about 6oz of macaroni. Followed the receipt for the skillet part.  This was so easy and didn't take much time. Smells great while it's cooking and tastes better then it smells! It also looks great on your plate. I think the spicy sausage really adds to the flavor. Tried it with regular Italian sausage once and it just wasn't as good. Definitely will add to favorites. Make at least once or twice a month!

simple to make and great way to add greens to a meal.  I used vegi pasta instead of regular pasta.  I also used mild sausage then substituted mild Rotel for the diced tomatoes. This dish has become a regular for my menu.

A keeper!  I was concerned about the soupyness of the sauce and I did cook it for a little longer than the recipe called for (in addition to a wee bit of corn starch slurry), but otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I used bow tie pasta because it was sold in a 3/4 pound box and the sauce stuck to it just fine.  Next time I would probably use a bit less onion but that's all I'd change.  My wife and I both had multiple helpings!

I needed a pasta recipe that is tasty but can be done quickly. This was certainly an awesome choice. I added some cooking wine as well as some herbs such as oregano and it all turned out very well.

Excellent tomato based sauce. I used fresh spinach as suggested as well as some leftover beans.  I buy Italian sausage when it is on sale in large packages so this is another great recipe to add into the rotation!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written, but had to modify a little because of what I had on hand. I used the diced tomatoes with basil and oregano, and didn't have chicken broth. So I just generously salted my pasta water, scooped a cup of that out of the pasta before draining it, and subbed that in. Delicious, and one less ingredient (which is always a plus for me). Leftovers were even yummier!

I didn't have spinach and didn't feel like running out just for that but it was delicious without it as well. Only suggestion for those of you saying its liquidity is let stand for 10 minutes before serving

Oh my gosh, this is SO incredibly delicious!  I've made it a few times, each time with a different kind of sausage - seriously, you can use whichever kind you want.  Also, the diced tomatoes and chicken broth DO tend to create a somewhat soupy final product, so I've learned to completely omit the chicken broth and instead just throw a single chicken bouillon cube in when I add the diced tomatoes - that way you get the chicken flavor but not all the extra liquid.

Quick and easy and it was DEVOURED by my family. This recipe is totally fine on it's own. I used Campanelle noodles and only did a few simple things differently mainly because of what I had available to me when I made it, but I didn't really change from the core recipe too much. 1) I didn't use olive oil to cook the sausage. Personal preference. It just seemed like overkill especially when I rinse the oil out after cooking anyways. I always cook my sausage in a bit of water instead. 2) I used a little under a full can of broth because other reviewers said it was too soupy. I made sure to cook it for a few extra minutes to reduce the juice. 3) I used a can of diced garlic and onion tomatoes because I didn't have a regular non-flavored can. 4 ) Because of that I reduced the full onion to a half and the garlic to 3 tsp because I didn't want it to be overpowered by onion and garlic. 4) I used fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen. So all in all, it was great. I will definitely keep this in my favorites and make it again.

The only change was that I used half of the broth.
We really liked it!

I didn't read the reviews until after I had made it.  It's good.  It's simple.  The broth and tomatoes don't reduce well; but will keep that in mind by either removing the juice from the tomatoes or using corn starch as a thickener.  

As it stands the al dente pasta (I used Cavatapp for this recipe) absorbs most of the broth and liquids which is fine as I made this for lunch for the work week.  Just be sure to warn co-workers -- 4 cloves of garlic are definitely pungent.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I made it on Sunday for myself to use for my lunches the following week.  It lasted from Monday to Friday.  Perfect amount of sauce or juice from the chicken broth; love sopping it up with my garlic bread.  I did not put any onion b/c I used a can of extra hot Rotel tomatoes and chilies (habanero chilies)  I added yellow sweet pepper also.  Will make this often !

Very easy and delicious.  This full can of tomatoe with the full can of broth made it very soupy so I had to summer for a while. Next time I will try fresh tomatoes and fresh spinach but definitely a keeper! Great for weeknight cooking.

Very easy and tasty!  I didn't have spinach so I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower.  Added a little more seasoning but not much else.  Will save this one for later

I gave this recipe 4 stars because after I tweaked it, it came out even better. I added a sliced zucchini for more veggies. I also substituted cheese tortellini for the pasta. Very good recipe!

Fantastic supper! My husband raved and asked me to make it again within the week! My changes: Added 1/2 cup halved grape tomatoes (in addition to the canned), 5 oz of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, used sweet Italian sausage (0g sugars, removed casings), cooked the onions first until soft then cooked the meat, took closer to 10 minutes to reduce,  and because we are a GF and Type 2 diabetic household, I served it over steamed cauliflower, with a brown/wild rice mix on the side to be added as desired. A huge hit!

I made this dish exactly as instructed. It is fantastic. My youngest loves it & he can be very finicky at dinner time. There was a small amount of the liquid left but I figured that the pasta will absorb it. I'm no fan of cooking really but I will definitely make this again. It's a keeper

For my family of guinea pigs, this was a hit! I used fresh spinach, pouring the pasta (small shells) water over to soften. I used mild sausage links, cooked with beer and sliced. I added canned mushrooms, some grated swiss in addition to the parm, and a bit of salsa to the drained tomatoes. Served with biscuits, buttered, made a great meal! I put all together in a large stainless bowl, mixed and transferred to large buttered casserole dish, topped with the parm. Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes, perfect!

My husband found this recipe & made it for the 4 of us & he hardly ever cooks! But I brought home sweet sausage from ShopRite & we went at it & I have to say that it was delicious, even made by a novice! My kids even asked for seconds. I'm sorry that my picture doesn't show as much of the sausage, as it does of the pasta (I didn't know at the time that I was going to be signing up for allrecipes and writing this review!)  But it's definitely a tasty dish and I would eat it again - and ask my husband to cook it! lol!

The pasta was tasty but it was more like soup than pasta. Next time, I will not use the juice from the tomatoes ad will cut back on the chicken broth.

I omitted the spinach because my boyfriend does not like spinach.  I read the reviews about it being too watery, so I used less chicken broth and it was still very watery.  He still really liked the flavor, though.  I am a vegetarian so I couldn't taste it!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. My picky kids, not so much. The only things I did differently was use fresh spinach, and started the onions cooking with the meat so they would get softer. I will definitely make this again, no matter what my kids say.

Love this recipe. I've made it too many times to count and have shared the recipe numerous times.  I double the basil.  I do use a lot of fresh baby spinach added at the end. Just stirring it through wilts it perfectly.  I would recommend draining the liquid from the tomatoes OR use a little less broth.  Quick, easy, tastes great, and the leftovers are wonderful.

This recipe was so simple and amazing! The only thing I did differently was I added a little milk and cornstarch, solely because I was impatient and didn't want to wait for the dish to reduce  (there was a lot of liquid).  I also added a few fresh cherry tomatoes shortly after I added the spinach because I wanted the bright red color.   I can't believe how great it turned out.  It's going to be a staple in my house from now on.

I made this for dinner twice it was very good and very easy to make. I use regular smoke sausage instead of the spicy sausage, but loved it. Will make it again very soon.

This was amazing. I used diced tomatoes with garlic and onion in the can and cut the amount of garlic and onion in half and I can't get enough. I love it. You should all try it.

My husband LOVED this!  I've never heard him rave so much about anything I've cooked!  After all ingredients are put in, you really have to let it simmer for at least 30 minutes.  I also added the Parmesan cheese to the pan to thicken it up.  I added artichoke hearts for the veggie and used LOTS of red pepper flakes and garlic. I added a little more Parmesan to each individual bowl and topped it with Feta cheese.  I omitted all of the other veggies except the diced tomatoes (I used stewed) and it was still awesome!

This was very flavorful! The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because it was a tad bit too soupy for us. Might cook it down longer next time or add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

This is a great recipe; I was able to whip it up with items I had on hand! The house smells sooo good while cooking this too. I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I subbed with a can of crushed tomatoes & added a little salt & pepper. Try it, you won't regret it. Thanks for sharing!

This is super easy, I added some chard and zucchini from the garden. No spinach. It seemed to be missing something, I threw is some italian seasoning but that wasn't it. My husband liked it better than i did. It did taste better the next day. I might try it again with some more tweaking. Healthy, pretty tasty and used up some garden veges.

Loved this recipe...i did use fresh spinach instead of frozen and added mushrooms.  I put the spinach in the colander and drained the pasta over it to slightly cook (as mentioned by a previous poster).  It worked great and it tasted amazing!  The whole family loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Calls for too much spinach and its bland with just the chicken broth. Better with marinara, also needs pepper

Super easy to make. I added red pepper flakes to my sausage and used broccoli instead of spinach. I only used half of the can of broth. Absolutely delicious.

This has become a staple in our house. As other reviewers suggested I used less chicken broth and added red wine. I also used homemade chicken broth (recipe found in AllRecipes) because the homemade has much more flavor. 

This is a very versatile recipe, have substituted the sausage with chicken and white wine and another time with white fish and white wine. Family ate it up.

We were looking for a good Italian Sausage Pasta mean and came across this and loved it.

Loved this recipe.  We tried something different and used Italian Sausage links and sliced them.  They were good in it but had to fry them a bit first to get them hard enough to slice easily.  Will try non links at some point but it was still good.  Also used fresh spinach.  We bought tomatoes that were basil, oregano, garlic flavored and it added a great amount of flavor.  Had no problem with flavor.  

We loved it so much we felt we cold have it just as a pasta meal as well with no meat and it would be just as good.  Would just saute the garlic and onions then poor in the chicken broth and tomatoes and then the spinach and noodles.

The sauce didn't really reduce but that wasn't a problem for us at all.

Me and my family love this recipe. I have made it several times with just a few changes. I use fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also use sweet sausage instead of spicy. I add about 1 TB of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and use corkscrew pasta to hold the sauce better. So easy to throw together and even better the next day!

Really good! I didn't have quite a few of the ingredients. Instead of a can of chicken broth I used 1 cup of chicken in a mug mixture, instead of spinach I used Kale and then I added diced fresh mushrooms. Kids didn't love the Kale but ate the rest! Easy and quick!

Very, very good. I did use a Videlia onion, 3 fresh Roma tomatoes chopped, fresh baby spinach, sweet Italian sausage(Target house brand), low sodium chicken stock, Penzy's roasted garlic, dried basil, no salt and grated fresh Romano pecorino. We both enjoyed this and will make it again using fresh vegetables.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good.  I used fresh Basil rather than dried one and in place of the frozen spinach I used fresh Broccoli florets.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, it can be made in a pinch and will be well received.

This was pretty good. I wanted something a little healthier so I mixed 1/2 lb. ground turkey with 1/2 lb. Italian sausage (removed from casing). Just cooked the ground meat with all the other ingredients except the chicken broth.  It was still a little soupy.  maybe next time I will add a little tomato paste.  I also added some dried oregano, salt and pepper.  I was a nice, quick weeknight meal. Oh, and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Great recipe..... I use cheddar bratwurst instead of Italian sausage.  The result is a much better flavor!  I also use a bag of fresh spinach instead of the frozen.

I made this today and it was worth the effort.  I made it exactly as written, although I used turkey sausage and orecchiette pasta.  My husband and I loved it.  I did use unsalted diced tomatoes, so I heavily salted the cooking water and we thought it was a little salty.  Will reduce the amount in the cooking water next time.

I used just under a cup of chicken broth, but I think I should have used 1 c. + because we have leftovers and it will be drier than we like.  A very good, filling meal.

I made this recipe several times and it seemed to lack something.  (NOTE:  my grocery store did not have Italian sausage so I used the smoked sausage loops from Hillshire Farm, sliced and halved.)  It was good but did not sparkle.  After some experimenting, I found that adding several TBSP of Cajun seasoning, a sprinkle of garlic and onion powders, and adding salad shrimp at the end of the cooking time really gave this dish a boost.  I usually make extra, so I increase the sausage to 2 lbs and increase the other ingredients accordingly.  I also use whole grain pasta (angel hair or spaghetti style) and the dish is amazingly flavorful.....I get tons of compliments on it.  And since it's so easy to make, it lends itself to many occasions!

This was simple and tasty. I tweaked just a bit, using fresh spinach, adding sweet red peppers, roasted almond slivers and modify salt and pepper and chili powder to taste. Super easy and delish - my favorite type of recipes!

This was a nice light tasting pasta.  There were only 2 of us so I prepared for 4 to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  That turned out to be a good idea.  I followed recipe exactly except I did not use oil.  Didn't need it.  Thanks submitter.

I made this for dinner tonight and we liked it a lot.  This may not be considered a fair review because I did make a few small changes....I used mild turkey sausage, removed from it's casing, and a full bag of fresh spinach instead of the frozen.  Other than that, everything was the same.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Tammy!

Delicious. I added more basil than it called for and cooked the sausage with half of the onion and garlic mixture and added half later. Used fresh spinach and added some sundried tomatoes. Really yummy. Will make again.

My picky daughter thought it was perfect, and the one who tries everything thought it was OK. I thought it a little bland, perhaps because I used sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy, but loved the ingredients. Perhaps I'll spice it up a bit next time.

This is so good and easy. I'm in California and used the spicy italian chicken sausage from Sprouts. Also used a package of fresh spinach, next time 2 packages!. This is a great recipe for someone that doesn't like a lot of fuss, (like me). Husband and I both enjoyed it.

Delicious!  I sliced red bell peppers with the onions, cooked for three minutes, added sliced chicken sausage and cooked for another three minutes, adding minced garlic for the last minute of cooking on medium high heat. Then I added about 10oz. of the chicken broth (not the whole can) along with the basil and some oregano.  I continued heating and stirring on medium to let the broth reduce a bit while the pasta finished cooking for ten minutes.  As others suggested, I drained the pasta on fresh spinach to let it wilt a bit, then added pasta and spinach to the skillet, stirred for a couple of minutes to let everything mix, and served hot.  My family dislikes tomatoes (crazy people...), so I omitted tomatoes altogether. The family LOVED it!  Great, simple recipe.

I was looking for a way to sneak more veggies into my kids along with their beloved pasta.  Plus the traditional red pasta sauce was getting old. This recipe filed the bill and them some!  Very savoury and delicious.  I only had sweet link Italian sausage on hand so I added some crushed red pepper flakes to add a little zing.  I roasted the sausage in the oven, cut it up, and added it to the sauce. If you're worried about the sauce being too runny you can always add a little cornstarch but adding the well drained pasta to the sauce should also thicken it.  My kids and my meat and potatoes wife really liked it.  This is a keeper and since my kids said they prefer bulk sausage to link (they don't like the casing) I will probably follow the recipe even more closely next time.

I took the advice of a few commenters: i added a little red wine, oregano, and paprika to the sauce; used low-sodium broth, wheat pasta, and mixed spicy and sweet sausage (and added a chicken breast!); and i put the fresh spinach in the colander when i drained the pasta. It was a delicious recipe! My boyfriend and i will definitely make again.

I made this exactly to the specifications of the recipe and it was WONDERFUL!  I never, in a million years, thought I'd get my teenage boys to eat spinach - but they gobbled it up.  This one will definitely go into the Dinner Rotation.

Keeper recipe. I used fresh basil as I had at hand. Also, I had some grape tomatoes that needed to be used before getting bad so I split them in halves and since I had canned crushed tomatoes added a little bit of the can as I did not have the tomatoes that the recipe call for at the moment. Honestly, it made the sauce a bit thicker. I do consider the only major change was to add salt to taste and freshly ground pepper at the end after the spinach is cooked to your likeness.

My incredibly picky husband said only three things while eating this: I like it, mmmmm, and that was good. So this is a keeper, for sure! I added some mushrooms in with the onion/garlic, added 1/2 teaspoon salt with the broth and tomatoes, and used about 3/4 package of chopped fresh spinach at the very end. Very easy and very good.

Great dish. Two out of four thought the spice level was great. The other two thought medium spiced sausage would be better. Our compromise .... Next time we we'll make this with medium spiced sausage and have crushed red peppers for those who like it on the spicy side.

Thought we had fresh spinach. Oops!  Substituted fresh kale and it was sensational!  Also, made with leftover sausage but we didn't have enough so I added in some ground turkey. Really came out well and less spicy for our two year old who gobbled it up!

4 stars as is 5 stars with changes. I read all the reviews and took some suggestions as well as using my own experience cooking the way my family likes things. I browned 1 1/2 pounds hot sausage and removed it from the pan. Then added the onions one chopped bell pepper, 2 teaspoons of fennel, 1 1/2 tea basil, a pinch of crushed red pepper and the garlic. Once the vegetables were softened I added 2 tablespoons of flour and cooked just until the raw flour taste cooked away, about 2 minutes. Then I added 1/2 cup of dry red wine, 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with the juice, 1 1/2 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon chicken stock base and just a little bit of water. I returned the sausage to the pan added a 5oz container of fresh baby spinach and covered the pan keeping it on low heat while I prepared the pasta. I also seasoned to taste with a small amount of salt and freshly ground black pepper. I placed the pasta in the bowls and topped it with the sausage mixture and a mixture of shaved Parmesan and Romano cheese. Hubby raved about it and asked that I be sure and write down exactly what I did so I can make it many more times in the future. :) Thanks for a great base recipe! Next time I'd like to add some zucchini ~ I forgot to pick some up this time.

So easy!! I only had mild Italian sausage so I think the addition of red pepper flakes would have added some spiciness, but overall, I thought it was very good. I made sure I pressed some of the juice out of the spinach so the dish wouldn't be watery. I used Bob Evans Italian Sausage which has no grease to drain, so olive oil is a must when cooking the sausage. I had some fresh basil on hand, so I used that. I think fresh Parmesan cheese would have been wonderful, but all I had was Kraft in the jar.This is a good meal to make when you come home from work tired and you don't feel like cooking. You can serve this to company with some Italian bread and you have a winner.

Try this recipe with cheese tortellini!  Awesome!  I used dried oregano, smoked paprika, and fennel to give it a little more dimension - but otherwise followed the recipe.  Great even for guests!

I cooked this and it was amazing!! I usually changed to my liking but with this recipe I changed nothing. Thank you it was a great and quick dinner to put together. The sausage I used was home made Italian. That's because I have a friend who makes it..

This dish is delicious and easy. I made almost exact but with fresh spinach (10oz bag). If you use fresh, remove the stems. I agree with another reviewer that using hot sausage is important for flavor. I didn't start cooking the whole wheat rotini until all but the spinach was cooking. I added the spinach, mixed until wilted and then added the pasta. So good. I made again and wanted leftovers so I used 1.5 lbs sausage, 1lb pasta and extra chicken stock.

i made this for dinner tonight and I just thought it was ok- the spice in the sausage added a kick but it needed more in my opinion. I added some salt, more basil and ended up with some heavy cream to thicken up the sauce. I think mushrooms would be good in this and maybe some more cheese like mozzarella melted into the sauce. Took much longer cooking times than recipe recommended to get sauce to reduce down as others have mentioned. I think less stock or drain the tomatoes.

Wow!  this is really good and very easy and simple.  I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage and fresh spinach and a little less chicken broth.  Also, I cooked the onion with the sausage and let it all simmer longer than suggested, but all in all the flavors were amazing.  This will be in my recipe box for a quick, easy meal for last minute company or just for us! Served in bowls over the past with a homemade focaccia bread.  YUM

Made this last night and it was a huge hit! My husband and 2 teenage boys loved it. I used regular italian sausage and fresh spinach with bowtie pasta. Excellent! I let it simmer for about 20 minutes before adding the pasta and spinach and I did not think it was too watery. Next time I am going to add mushrooms. This had great flavor.

This is absolutely fantastic, and a great base for pasta dishes in general. I eat this all of the time. However, I change it up a tad bit. I use fresh spinach and turkey sausage. I tend to skip the parmesan and the chicken broth, but either way it tastes good. Canned diced tomatoes make your dish a bit watery, so if you don't like that, I suggest adding a teaspoon or two or corn starch to thicken it up. You can also bu red cherry (or grape) tomatoes and cut them in half and throw them in the frying pan instead.

If you want some more vegetables, I find that mushrooms really enhance the flavor of this dish (I prefer crimini or baby portobello as they have an earthier and stronger taste). Throw in some parsley and/or chives to top it off. And if you like mozzarella, some fresh mozzarella in the end takes the dish to a whole new level!

An amazingly tasty dish and one that is easily changed and played around with.

I am always looking for a new, quick recipe to add to our rotation. This one fit the bill. Lots of flavor, easy to prepare and just delicious. I will say, this recipe is easy to alter to your tastes and likely should be altered depending on your target audience. I found it to be a touch on the spicy side for kids but by no means "hot". Mild italian sausage might be best for the lil' ones. Veggie wise, I would at a minimum recommend adding some fresh mushrooms to the onions when cooking. I would likely use a bit of fresh zuchinni next time as well. Also, do not be scared to use all the spinach. I added 12oz. of fresh spinach and it looked like a crazy amount when I tossed it in but within 5 minutes is was cooked and hard to find. When my two young daughters ate it, they were surprised how good it was. Also, a touch of salt is good for it.

As others recommended I used mild italian sausage (and only 2 links, about 1/2 lb,  with casings removed and roughly chopped during browning) and adjusted the heat with a heaping teaspoon of chili garlic paste. All other ingredients and directions followed exactly. This was simple and delicious.

This was wonderful!  I used a chicken sausage and it was flavored with basil and Asiago cheese.  Delicious! Will definitely make again!

This is an excellent recipe! Used fresh spinach adding it at the end of cooking time. Leftovers were delicious the next day after being gently reheated.

This recipe is really good, except for it comes out so soupy. I even drained the tomatoes, but for some reason it was still really, really soupy. Very good flavors though!

Since the biggest complaint is that this dish is too watery, I used Diced Tomato in "rich juice" (but no added herbs, onion, etc), and I added a heaping Tbsp of flour while simmering.

Also, I had to use Sweet Italian bulk sausage rather than Spicy, so I added Cayenne, Paprika, Italian Blend dried herbs, extra garlic. Instead of spinach, I used fresh kale (more body). Low sodium chicken broth. "Bowtie" pasta. The result: five stars!

This recipe gets a big thumbs up with me and my family!  Quick,  easy, and tasty,  we will definitely make this again.  The only thing I did differently was use sweet Italian sausage because I don't care for the hot.

Great recipe. I  used 3/4 of a lb. of sweet, and 3/4 of a lb. of hot bulk chicken Italian sausage and let the liquid reduce while the pasta cooked and then added about 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Hubs and son liked it very much. Will be making this again.

I used Sausage lengths instead and cut them into 1/4 bite size.  I half the spicy sausage with sweet sausage because using only spicy only would be too spicy.  I seasoned the Olive oil and sausage by adding the minced Garlic in the beginning instead of the last 5 minutes of cooking. I used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes.

This was very good. I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and used fresh spinach.   I put the sausage in the freezer for 30 minutes and was able to easily remove the sausage casing.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was amazing!! I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. I pan fried the sausage a bit then threw in the onions and garlic. I then boiled it in the tomato/chicken broth mixture for about 30mins. I found this helped with thickening the sauce up. Near the end I threw the baby spinach in. My boyfriend ate two plates back to back! This recipe is a keeper!!

I used smoked spicy Italian sausage, casings removed and crumbled. I used Rotini shaped pasta to caputer all the goodness in the swirls. I watched carefully while adding the liquid so it wouldn't get too soupy. I also used fresh spinach and fresh basil. I had some leftover roasted butternut squash and tossed that in, too! DELISH, I will be making this over and over.

This was perfect; I made enough for leftovers for the week!!!:)  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used fresh ones, and as for spinach, again, I used fresh:)  Now I wonder if I can use Qunoa instead of pasta.  I'm afraid of eating too much of this wonderful dish and getting round in the belly again from too many carbs!!!:)

I am generally more of a 'creamy sauce' fan, but I have to say…. I am so glad that I stepped out of my comfort zone a bit and tried this recipe. It was wonderful! Super simple & quick, but the flavours are absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of adding just a touch of salt.

Made this for dinner tonight followed recipe but let it reduce a bit longer as my husband was gonna be late getting home. I also added red pepper flakes so my sensitive 9 year old daughter said it was too spicy. My husband and I however LOVED it. Next time though I will use fresh spinach....oh and no red pepper flakes!!

This was excellent!  I blended the tomatoes because I don't like chunks and used a good quality hot pork sausage.  I also made it gluten-free by using GF penne pasta.  It turned out very well.

Love this dish   Ive made it around 10 times now and its a crowd pleaser.   I try to use fresh ingredients as much as possible, and sometimes replace the chicken broth with white wine... Thanks for  a fantastic recipe Tammy

I sometimes add some white wine with the chicken broth and let it cook off. It's fantastic.

I was very worried about this recipe. The first time I saw the picture, I just wanted to make it. It just looks very delicious. But then when I saw the bad reviews, I got a little worried. But of course, there were soooo many great reviews and had to make it. As I was making it, I thought maybe all those bad reviews were going to be right, but NO!! This recipe is soooo great! It tastes amazing. The only thing I did different was that I used fresh tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes can and fresh spinach instead of the frozen chopped spinach. And it was amazing!!

Just made this tonight for my family and it was a hit--even my 2 year old liked it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly--I did add a splash of marsala for a little extra flavor. Next time I'll use whole leaf spinach I think just bc it's a personal preference. I'm a big fan of this recipe and will be adding it to our rotation!

I used chicken sausage for the health benefit but otherwise followed to a T, it was just ok. I won't make it again.

We thought this was ok. However, I used sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy because I was hoping my toddlers would eat it. They didn't like it anyway, so next time we will try spicy. The sauce was a bit too watery. I did add about 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream which helped but still could have been thicker. The flavor over all was good but my husband and I both felt that something was still missing but couldn't put our finger on what it needed. Maybe we will try fresh spinach and basil next time to see if that and spicy sausage do the trick. I did like that this was a quick meal to put together. Great week night, one dish meal.

Made this without the spinach, and used mild farmers' sausage with casings removed. The kids don't like hot sausage. Meal was delicious. Definitely a keeper. The only change I would make next time is I don't think the olive oil was necessary. There was enough fat from the sausages.

It was easy to make and to adapt to the ingredients you have already. I added  a bit of hot spices then it really got interesting. Already making variations on this this with different sausages and pastas, even spaghetti.

This recipe was great! Super easy to make! I didnt have chicken broth so I used tomato paste mixed with water, and used diced cherry tomatoes instead of the canned ones and it turned out great! Also, added mushrooms.

So I made this for dinner and it is now officially my husband's "FAVORITE".  I would say its mine also.  It was really GOOD, really FAST and really EASY!!!!  I used Bow-Tie pasta & I didn't use the whole 10 oz pkg of Spinach, I just eyeballed the amt I wanted in there, and I didn't use the onions because yuck (haha,) but I highly recommend this recipe!!

I decided to give this recipe a try because both me and my husband love pasta and sausage, so it makes sense to put it together! I couldn't find italian sausage so I got regular ground sausage and added italian seasoning to it. I read some reviews where it was too much liquid so I was hesitant to add the whole can of chicken broth and tomatoes, but I decided to go for it. To me it was a perfect amount of liquid and I had leftovers so it soaked up some more overnight. Great amount and was so darn tasty! My husband raved about this and even went for seconds! I ate the leftovers for lunch that week and it just kept getting better! I highly recommend this recipe, would also be great for a potluck meal!

Excellent recipe! I added can of Rotel tomatoes + 1 can of Spicy Red Pepper diced tomatoes, then cooked slightly longer to reduce the extra liquid. Also used fresh spinach like other reviewers.

I made this last night and we just loved it. I used chicken sausage, left out the broth (lower sodium this way), used fresh tomatoes (I had tomatoes that I was afraid if I did not use them soon they would go bad), a clove of garlic I added some zucchini, just had some on hand so I put in 1 large halved then sliced thin put with onion and garlic to brown then added chicken sausage. Great hubby loved it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I read the reviews and adjusted the cooking but not the ingredients.  It helps to let the liquid reduce to half before adding the spinach.  This helped to make a less "soupy" dish and intensified the flavor.  Leftovers were just as good!

We used cooked organic chicken sausage, chicken stock, did not have a onion so used onion powder, fresh basil and fresh spinach. Topped with Parmesan/Romano cheese. My kids and I loved it and they requested seconds. DH said is was somewhat bland. I will make this again with variations.

I thought it was lacking a little flavor. My husband liked it, but next time I will try a different sausage.  I used Jimmy Dean "hot". But it was a pretty easy meal. Will definitely have again.

Hubby and I are not fennel fans, so I make my own sausage using ground pork (90/10 ratio). Other than that change I followed the recipe and it was REALLY good.  I followed a few suggestions and eased up a bit on the amount of broth. I also added a diced carrot.  I want to make this with brown rice next time.  thanks for such a good recipe

I'll give it 5 stars as it looks good but haven't made it yet, am going to make it one day this week.  I guess the only problem I might have is that you do not drain the grease from the beef mixture.  I would do that, don't need all that fat.

Really good, and easy to adapt for food restrictions. I used gluten free pasta and subbed green onions (can't eat any other kind), made sausage from a recipe on this site, and used fresh tomatoes and spinach. Delish!

This pasta dish is so good! It's unbelievably simple too. I always use a bag of fresh spinach, 1 LB of pasta and increase the broth to match. Today I used fresh basil. Will make again and again!

I used fresh spinach and added a little pesto. Also the liquid was too thin so I mixed flour and water on the side then added it to thicken it up a bit.

I rocked this recipe even if I do sy so myself! LOL!  I added several things to it to beef up the flavor.  I cut red and green bell pepper strips to add with the onions. I melted a stick of real butter with a tablespoon of olive oil and some white wine and lemon juice. I added that to the pan with the chicken broth.  I also added a touch of oregano and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Awesome recipe!  My whole family including my in-laws LOVED IT!

Pretty bland for me.  I added what I had in the fridge to pep it up:  leftover salsa, kalamata olives and some half and half to thicken the sauce and help it stick to the pasta.  With all of that, it was pretty good but probably won't make it again.

My husband found this recipe and made it as a surprise one night, which truly did surprise me as he doesn't usually eat veggies! We both loved how light and delicious this was. It's entered our regular rotation as it's easy and you can add whatever veggies you have on hand. We use wheat pasta, low-sodium broth and diced tomatoes with green chilies. Thanks!

I will give this recipe a 4 star, mainly because I am so sick and can hardly taste anything. I used fresh spinach, marjoram instead of basil, mild italian sausage, red onion. I did not add all the chick stock. It was easy to make and I am sure it added a good smell to the home .

This was very easy and delicious!i used fresh spinach and added some feta since I needed to use some up, but other than that I followed the instructions. I also used some salt and pepper too. Everything needs to be seasoned right?

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter the first time.  I tried changing little things a couple of times but the first time I made was definitely the best.

This was good, but not great. Maybe with more seasoning it would be better. I did not get the spicy Italian sausage so that might have made a difference. Might make again with some modifications.

This recipe was pretty darn close to what I was looking for to make a quick and easy dinner.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, skipped the chicken broth, added a little wine and a tablespoon of onion and chive cream cheese for a little creaminess.  Yum!

Really good!  I used elbow macaroni (only pasta I had) and tomatoes with green chilis to give it a little kick.  My sausage was already pre-cooked so didn't have to use any oil.  I like to keep it as low cal as possible .  I would definitely recomend.

This is delicious and easy.  I do not use the can of chicken broth, but add another can of diced tomatoes with the liquid. I added broccoli florets as I didn't have spinach on hand. YUMMMMMY!

Made this with some changes in order of cooking some ingredients..  but nothing major.   Probably upped the cheese to a full C or more.  :-)  and used fresh fettuccine from a local Italian market.  All I can say is the family sucked it down!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe, however added cooking wine, 4 different kind bell peppers, fresh thyme, more garlic, ( garlic lover here)cayenne pepper for just a hint of spicy. Let it slow cook for 2 hrs so all ingredients can mesh.Eating out is a treat but you pay the price and its not as good as good old home cooking.   Much more healthier too.

This was awesome. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh baby spinach. I crushed the tomatoes and gently heated them in a skillet before adding them. It was fabulous immediately after completion!

Delicious with a few modifications. At first glance I thought the recipe called for too much onion - so I only used half an onion and I think I was right. Also fresh tomatoes instead of canned. But when tasting prior to adding the pasta I still felt the sauce just tasted like onions and tomatoes. So I added a little red wine and 1/2 a can or cream of mushroom soup and reduced further. Perfection! Hubby loved it too!

I thought it was ok; however, the next time I make it I'm going to use less liquid. I tried to thicken it with tomato paste because it was too soupy. All in all great flavor just a bit to soupy for me.

Made this tonight and I was quite pleased and would definitely make it again. I did read over the reviews before making it for helpful tips and any insight. I used fresh baby spinach and I just added what I thought would be good because I didn't want it to be too much. I used hot Italian sausage which gave the dish the perfect kick. I also didn't add as much chicken broth as it called for and I held some aside and mixed a little cornstarch in it then added that to everything. Thickened it up nicely. I also simmered it for 15 minutes before I added the spinach.

I LOVE this pasta and can't seem to eat just one serving at a time - so tasty! The only difference I made when putting together was not to use oil to cook the sausage - the sausage cooks fine in its own juices.

Yes and it was delicious!!!!  I did make changes though.  Instead of frozen spinach I used 3 cups of fresh torn up spinach.  I added fresh mushrooms and used 2 cups of tomato juice versus the diced tomatoes.  2/3 a box of pasta us plenty.  My daughter was pessimistic at first, because of the spinach, but she loved it!!!

This recipe has become a favorite. Delicious. Sometimes I use garlic powder instead, & it's still good. I also like to add an extra can of tomatoes, & I allow everyone to add their own cheese instead of putting it in the sauce.

awesome!! after reading some reviews, i made some modifications (as is typical for me). i used sweet sausage; i coarsely chopped fresh spinach and added it to the sausage mixture to heat through while the pasta drained; i used petite diced tomatoes and added a squeeze of tomato paste; i made 1 cup broth using granulated bullion. i simmered until the broth reduced a little. i will add this to the rotation! my husband, who isn't fond of spinach had three helpings! thank you for this recipe - it's a great base for a great meal!

It was good. Do not need a full can of broth. Less then half. Also drain tomatoes. Skinless sausage works best.  Was a good dish I will make it again.

Awesome! Pretty much followed the exact recipe except I used turkey Italian sausage and I did not put in the liquid from the diced tomatoes (glad I didn't- it still had a lot of liquid). Definitely putting it in the rotation!

Good recipe overall, but next time I make it I'll be cutting my own tomatoes - I found using canned diced tomatoes did the dish's texture no favors.

This was so easy to make! I used sweet italian sausage because we had a couple of packages left over from a football party. I also threw in some red bell pepper that I needed to use up. Both were really yummy! I accidentally bought frozen leaf spinach instead of the chopped, and it worked fine, but the pieces were too big. Chopped spinach probably would've worked better. I would also like to try this recipe with roasted garlic chicken sausage (or any flavor chicken sausage, really). I bet it would be delicious!

Mmm! I was so tired of always having just onion, peppers and pasta with my sausage. This meal was so easy, using simple ingredients. My husband and son loved it too!

Awesome and super easy.  I used turkey sausage and a can of diced tomatoes w/green chilis (hot), flavor was great.  We did not have any parm cheese, so just added a little feta before serving.  We will be making this again. Thank you for this easy/healthy meal!!!

Really good.  I only added 1/2 of the Chicken Broth vs the entire can...I used 2 full cans of diced tomatoes vs 1 can.  Added some red win and also added mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper

Trie this for first time tonight and we loved it. Followed some other reviewers suggestions and used fresh tomatoes, fresh spinach and mushrooms. Also added 1/2 cup red wine and splash of half & half. Also used half sweet sausage & half spicy sausage. Will definitely make again. Thank you.

I tried this recipe as I bought 2 lbs. of mild Italian sausage that I didn't what to do with. Normally, whenever I try a new recipe, I always follow the recipe's ingredients and directions to the letter as it would only be fair to do so esp. if I plant to rate and review it afterwards. I didn't have any basil at hand so I put in dried oregano instead. Plus I bought mild sausage so I added smoked paprika and pepper to it while cooking the sausage to compensate for the lack of heat. Otherwise, the recipe itself is perfect and the whole family loved it. Even the kids didn't have any qualms eating the spinach. This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe!  We took advice from several previous reviewers.  We took the casing off the sausage, reduced it longer, and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  Thanks for all the tips.

This was soooo good!! My fiancé and I made this and loved it. We didn't alter it at all which is odd, because he always alters and changes things! LoL      XD hopefully you'll enjoy too! 

Ingredients weren't very expensive, it was around $10 and lasted a few days.

This is really delicious and simple to make.     30 minutes from start to finish and because of the sausage and garlic, it requires no other seasoning (salt, etc).    Next time I make it, I will drain the can of diced tomatoes first.   Like others have commented, mine came out entirely too watery and after giving it considerable time to cook down, I gave up.   Ended up throwing in a couple tablespoons of cream mixed with cornstarch and it thickened up perfectly and was quite delicious that way as well.

This was very good.  I tried to make it in a slow cooker to save time but that was a mistake because I couldn't reduce the liquid so I turned it into a soup - next time I'll make as directed - but the soup was good too.

I absolutely LOVE pasta that has sausage, spinach, tomatoes and Parmesan cheese because it's the perfect meal to put together in less time. When I added the frozen spinach, canned tomatoes and chicken broth, the pasta dish turned into soup. I had to pour out some of the canned tomatoes and chicken broth-since I didn't want to eat soup! My sister and I enjoyed this recipe, but next time, I'm going to add fresh spinach, canned tomatoes without the broth, heavy whipping cream and spicy Italian sausage. :-)

Super easy & quick. I used a very spicy italian sausage that was practically to spicy to eat on it's own and my wife and I found it mellowed out the flavor enough to make the dish quite delicious!

Excellent!  We used ground chicken instead of sausage (because that's what I had) and strained tomatoes instead of diced, but other than that made no other changes.  What a flavorful dish that was so quick and easy to make!  Will definitely make this again.

this turned out well, though I did make some alterations based on what I already had. For the sausage, I used the Jimmy Dean Hot crumbled sausage. When it was pretty cooked, I added the onion, and also some sliced mushrooms. Instead of chicken broth, I used 7 oz of chardonnay, based on reviews (I'd try sherry next time!). I skipped the tomatoes and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. For the pasta, I went with farfalle (bow tie). I topped individual portions with crumbled feta. I thought it all came together pretty well, and would make again.  ** UPDATE: don't use cream sherry - wasn't as good as the chardonnay. I've now tried it with rotini and rigatoni as well, and it was best with the farfalle.

This was an easy, yummy meal!  This recipe gave me a good basic foundation/inspirationand I used it to make a great, lighter version.  I used Eckrich smoked turkey sausage (skinless), fresh sweet bell pepper sliced thin, omitted the broth and followed the rest of the recipe, for the most part.  I did use fresh spinach tho.  Served it over Dreamfields penne pasta and YUM!!  Will make this again!

I have a family of 10. With a little tweeking we all LOVED it! I did use fresh spinach though and also mild ROTEL tomatoes for added flavor. I used 1 lb of penne and 2 lbs of ground sausage. It was awesome!! We had 2 of the neighbor kids over also and they loved it to! So it was a favorite all around. I think I will make it for the next pot luck.

I made this tonight for my husband and not only was it delicious but an easy week night meal. I followed the recipe completely but in the end we made a simple pesto with pistachio's and we mixed it in and boy was it good. The only reason for the pesto was that our garden needed a little trim but I have to say this dish stands on it own just fine. I plan on freezing the left overs and with any luck we will have a couple lunches to enjoy out of it. This dish makes it into the recipe box for sure!!!

This was a hit. I used Jimmy Dean regular sausage.  My husband isn't a fan of spinach so I threw in sliced black olives instead.  And I didn't have broth so I used water and some chicken bouillon.  Delicious.

I added 1/4 cup of cooking sherry because I like the sweetness it adds. I also added some cornstarch dissolved in a bit of cold water since the liquid wasn't reducing like the recipe claimed. Husband liked it and I plan on copying the sauce without the sausage for a light red sauce on its own.

Easy and delicious.  I mostly followed the directions as written, used roasted tomatoes and added a bell pepper.  I did let it simmer a bit to reduce and added fresh spinach near the end,  but other than that no changes.  It's really good.

Followed the recipe in terms of ingredients - except used ziti instead of penne.  Overall, it is rather soupy.  Had to let it boil off for about 15 minutes and add a pinch of flour to get it saucy.  I would not recommend adding the canned tomato water.  If I tried it again I would use fresh spinach, fresh cherry tomatoes and fresh basil - added right before serving.  One positive is that it is very colorful and looks appetizing!

Delish! Followed exactly. Next time I will use fresh basil. Also, boiling down the chicken broth and tomato takes longer than 5 minutes.

This is one of our favorite go-to meals because it's so easy to make & we have leftovers for lunches & another dinner. I use fresh spinach & about 3 times more than the recipe calls for. I don't do anything special with it, just toss it in while the liquids are reducing. I also use much more parmesan cheese than the recipe calls for. For the people asking about how to prepare the sausage: I just use kitchen scissors, cut the link in 1/2 & then snip chunks away. I don't remove the casting.

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was I added a little flour to thicken the sauce.  I gave the told my Mom and Aunt about the recipe and they have both tried it and liked it too.  It was a nice change from pasta with tomato sauce.

I didn't change a thing, except that I had fresh Kale to use instead of Spinach, and to make sure it cooked all the way through I put it in the pan just after the onions and garlic sauteed for a couple of minutes.  Don't worry about not draining the grease from the Sausage, it works out fine.  I only had local farm raised "breakfast sausage links" on hand but that worked out great, it was pretty spicy and not sweet at all, so don't worry about what type of sausage to use.  Served with some french bread.  Yumm!

Tastes great but way too much liquid, especially considering I used less than 1 cup of broth.

This was very good and so fast to make.  I used hot turkey sausage and fresh spinach.  I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.  I will make this again - so delicious and easy - exactly what I look for!!

I subbed fresh ingredients (spinach, tomatoes) and found this recipe easy to make and pretty decent. This wasn't a super flavorful dish but was satisfying enough for me (especially with some extra basil). I also found that the sauce mixture didn't reduce as much as expected, so it was a little more soupy than it was pasta sauce-ey. However, this worked well for me as I refrigerated my leftovers and each subsequent meal was still moist and yummy!

This so so easy, and tastes like a meal you would get at a good restaurant. Husband requests this often!  We have used hot, mild, and turkey sausage and its equally as tasty either way.  I use fresh grape tomatoes and fresh chopped spinach, also add about 1/3 cup of red wine with the broth, and a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  Love it with the wine!

Loved this flavorful and easy dish! Also liked the fact that there was enough left for the two of us to have the leftovers tomorrow night!  Make sure to reduce the sauce somewhat before adding the pasta.  Great recipe...thanks!!

This is an AWESOME recipe. The only difference for me was... I used sweet turkey sausage (removed casting), dried parsley (didn't have basil), Kale instead of spinach, asparagus and a tad bit of salt. Oh and a small amount of tomato paste and a dash of redp pepper flakes. OMG it is DELISH!!!!!!!!!! Def a keeper.

This is an excellent, easy recipe. I did use fresh tomatoes and fresh spinach. I used a spicy italian sausage; removed it from casing and browned it in larger chunks that made for a very flavorful sauce. Also, reduced amount of chicken broth by half. I'm sure I will making this many more times.

Simple, tasty and great way to get kids (and husbands) to eat more veggies and like it.  Have made it several times and given it to friends following surgery, and it is VERY good! Have always made it exactly as called for, which is highly unusual, but love the possibilities!

I really enjoyed the recipe, my boyfriend said it was the best meal I ever made lol. 
I followed instructions exactly, except used slightly less chicken broth as previous reviewers said it was a little too liquidy , and used fresh spinach, which i think also cut down on the liquid amount. I also used a TON of red pepper flakes, just cuz i like things spicy. Super easy, good and fast.

i was hestitant to try this recipe after reading all the bad reviews about the pasta being soupy but i thought what the heck, and it turned out great! the only change i made was add a little more garlic, less spinach(i found the porportions of ingredients to be off in the recipe) and i added some paprika, black pepper and a little salt. Also after reading all the reviews about the pasta being too watery i used less chicken broth(i put a little bit at a time to monitor the wateriness) and i also didnt used crushed tomatoes instead i used fresh tomatoes and deseeded them to get the watereness out...and it turned out great! not watery at all!

Very tasty! I used fresh basil and added some freshly ground black pepper. There was a bit of liquid left in the pan (delicious liquid!), but it was nothing that a piece of garlic bread couldn't soak up!

I followed the recipe except for using fresh spinach. I loved it. My kids didn’t. That’s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I’ll try again in a few years and see if their taste buds will be happier as they get older.

Excellent food doesn't need to be complicated or difficult to cook. This recipe is proof of that fact. I deglazed the pan (after the garlic and onion were done) with 1/4 c. white wine and used fresh basil. Perfect!

I added a tsp of oregano, used a full pound of pasta and 12 oz of frozen spinach.  I didn't have spicy sausage so I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauce. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS!!  It was such a nice change from the usual thick red sauce and pasta dishes I make.  This will be added to our regular meal rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe with only very minor changes. I made it with fresh spinach, added a handful of green beans and used chicken bouillon instead of canned broth. I made it in an electric skillet and it was fast, easy and delicious! Will make again. This recipe can be very versatile.

Love, love, love this. I make it at least once a month. The only tweak I suggest is not to add all the broth at once. Sometimes it's just too much, add a little at a time as needed. This is a flexible recipe and a great way to use up odds and ends. I've used spicy, mild, sweet and chicken sausage.  During the summer I'll use fresh spinach, basil and tomatoes from the garden. We especially like it with whole wheat penne and fire roasted tomatoes. It does make a lot but the leftovers are even better the next day.

This recipe is very good.  I did make a few changes.  I sauteed the sausages till they were almost cooked through figuring they would continue to cook while the sauce was reducing. I ran out of basil and used McCormicks Italian Seasoning.  And I reduced the chicken broth to 8 oz.  I did add the spinach but next time I will switch it with  two sauteed green peppers.

This recipe is a keeper! So easy, so good.  I believe a good-quality, hot sausage is key to its success. I made a few minor changes that were suggested by other readers.  I used Rotel Tomatoes with Green Chiles. I added some heavy cream mixed with a little cornstarch as a thickening agent.  I added a bit of Madeira wine, too.  Even without these minor changes, I'm sure the dish would be delicious.  My son and husband LOVED it, and have asked that it goes into my meal rotation. Consider it done!

This was great!  I gave it four stars, only because it was better with a couple minor changes.  As recommended by others, I used a bag of fresh baby spinach - I put it in a colander, and strained the cooked noodles over it, so it steamed slightly when the noodles were being strained, then added everything together.  I also added a bit of red cooking wine (maybe 1/4 cup or so - I didn't measure), as well as some cayenne pepper and extra garlic to give it more flavor and kick.  It was tasting a little bit bland until I made those changes.  Overall, great recipe - it's a definite keeper that we will be making again.

A keeper! If you can't buy the sausage out of the casing just snip the end off the casing and squeeze it out, takes two seconds. I always use fresh spinach, just toss it in the last few minutes of cooking. It's so delicate, it's done in seconds. I find frozen strong tasting. Dot't forget fresh herbs, Yum! This recipe is a bit liquidy...hold back on your broth and add the rest as you feel you should. I love the spicy turkey sausages too! Not only is it better for you but it makes this dish pop with flavour. I rarely use pasta but change up the choice from time to time or my favouite...omit pasta and add lentils, curry and garam masala for more of a soup fashion. Fun and delicious!

I made this tonight according to the recipe with 1 exception. I added a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper. It came out so good!! There was a little broth at the bottom of each bowl that was scrumptious!!

I will most definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing it with us!

Quick & easy, but sauce needs to be thickened slightly (maybe add cornstarch?).  Flavor was good, but got complaints about needing to drain off the excess liquid (which was supposed to be the sauce).  I'll try it again using a thickener with the broth & spices.

My family loved this. I used mild sausage since I was preparing it for three young kids, and I subbed arugula for the spinach since it was all I had on hand. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly. I did find it to be a little watery so i also ended up adding a little cornstarch at the end to thicken it up. My husband gave it rave reviews--I  will be making this again!

Great flavors! But I agree with one of the reviews below. It didn't reduce as much after 5 minutes so I waited another 5-10 and it was still pretty soupy. So, next time I think I'll just add half of the broth.
Thank you though, I will definitely use this recipe again!

This pasta was simple & delicious for a quick weeknight dish. I purchased a rotissere chicken to go with it. However changed a few things but for most part followed recipe. I like spicy rich foods (sorry healthy eaters). I used Patton's hot sausage & did not drain fat but cont'd w recipe by adding onion/garlic. I only used 8oz of chicken broth & used the liquid in the tomatoes as well. i also added teaspoon of my essence (i dont use salt. I used frozen spinach & did not cover skillet to reduce liquid. I followed step4 (used penne pasta) & served the pasta immediately. It was awesome & I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe last week. Very simple and quick to make and absolutely delicious! It also definately conducive to modify it to your own taste. I made it pretty much as written BUT used fresh spinach & flavored diced tomatoes since the recipe uses the juices (Del Monte Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic & Oregano to be exact.) I also followed the advice of some of the other reviewers about cutting down on the amount of liquid which I also did. I discovered I didn't need to use any of the chicken broth. It was plenty juicy and yummy!!

I had left overs which I brought to work. I heated it up in the microwave and forgot it back in the lunch room. I had coworkers come up to me to tell me how good it is 'cause it smelled so good and they had to taste it. I was asked if it was from a restaurant. I had to laugh. I ended up having 4 coworkers taste it and two of them have made the recipe so far. They reported loving it too. 

Great, simple, easy to make and absolutely yummy to the tummy! Thanks for sharing!!!

Very, very good with interesting flavors.  It was such a nice change.  My only complaint was that the sauce needs to be thicker, we had to serve in bowls.  Even added heavy cream but still a little thin.  Had thickened up overnight however and the leftovers were even better!  I topped with feta instead of parmesan and it was delish!  Hubby even had leftovers which he NEVER does.

This was great!  I did substitute mild sausage for the spicy for my children and my 2 1/2 year old told me I made a great dinner.  I will say that I wish I had used a little bit more sausage, but I also had used an entire pound of pasta vs. the 3/4.  Overall I will be making this again!

We didn't care for this. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. I was rather blah. I made two changes to the directions. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I drained the tomatoes before adding.I am sure glad I did the later. This was too "soupy" as it was, I can't imagine having the water from the canned tomatoes in it as well. I will not be making this one again.

Yes I have made a version of this for years, but I was adding to much tomato. The chicken broth is the answer. I did reduce hot sauage by 1/2 and added 1/2 ground beef( husband likes less spice). Also added sauted celery, green pepper with the onion. I forgot spinach---so made salad to go with it. Next time will pay attention. I have always called this "Goulash" my daughter makes her version & calls it "Mystery". Thank you for good basic recipe.

This reminded me of a dish that my husband always orders at our favorite little local Italian place, so I thought I'd try it.  We're both very happy that I did!  It was very tasty, very easy to make, and very easy to clean up after!  We both loved it, and have added it to our great-things-to-eat-at-home short-list.
Slight changes that I made:
In Direction #3, I cooked over medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, which reduced the liquid quite a bit.
Also in Direction #3, I added fresh baby spinach AFTER the mixture had reduced to my liking, then just stirred it for a moment until the spinach began to wilt, and then moved right on to Direction #4.

Very good! This was a nice change from the usual chicken pasta. After reading one review, I also drained the tomatoes and added some heavy whipping cream to the sauce (about 1 cup). I think it added some great flavor. I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up although at the end I wasn't sure it was necessary. Next time, I will use 2 cans of tomatoes as it seemed like there wasn't quite enough. Will definitely be making again!

This was really good!  Like others suggested, I used fresh spinach and added it in at the end.  I also under cooked the pasta a bit so it could sit in with the liquid at the end and absorb some.  I adjusted my portions a bit based on what we had but the only thing I changed that wasn't on here was added some half & half to the sauce and left off the parmesan cheese (kids added it to theirs when eating).  Definitely a keeper!

This was DELICIOUS!!!! Made a few EASY changes, which created an amazing sauce.

Added approx. (1) 10oz. can tomato paste to the ch. broth & tom. sauce mixture. Withought adding the tom. paste, the sauce was too watery. Covered & simmered sauce on low for about 10 minutes. Added Spinach, covered & allowed sauce to simmer for about 15 minutes. Added Penne & tossed well. Plated pasta & topped with grated Locatelli & fresh Parsley.....AWESOME!!!! My kids loved this so much, they want to name it!!

Great recipe! My husband & teen age boys loved it! My changes based on other reviews: 1/2 cup white wine,crushed red pepper, extra basil, and fresh baby spinach. I also used a can of fire- roasted tomatoes as that was what I had on hand. Good quality sausage does make a difference. I will definitely make this again. My youngest tends to be very picky and he had seconds, that's my indication of a good recipe!

Everything sounded good when looking at the recipe, & went nearly exactly by the ingredients except I used 1 bag of Fresh Baby Spinach and fresh basil leaves chopped.  Added a bit of red Vino which took a bit longer to cook down.  Overall was good but not one of the better Italian dishes I've made.  Guess my expectations were higher given that I used fresh spinach/basil.  Definitely worth trying as other "taste buds" may find it more appealing than I/we did.

This was really yummy, especially on a cold winter day.  I, however, turned the recipe into a soup.  I added more broth and a can of tomato soup and used Rotel tomatoes to spice it up.  I also used elbow macaroni instead of Penne pasta.  Turned out great!

I made this tonight for dinner and it surprised me. I smelled good, tasted delicious! I didn't even have any oregano or paras ran cheese, so I made the recipe as instructed, and instead of tossing the sauce and pasta together I put pasta into a 9x13 baking dish, poured the sauce over the sprinkled with motzeralla cheese and baked at 375 for 15 minutes!!!! I added no salt, used no salt added diced tomatoes and reduced sodium chicken broth. Threw in organic kale And fresh spinish!!

Actually I have been fixing something similar for years, I use penne pasta or bow ties and use fresh spinach and sun ripened tomatoes. I leave the cheese for table add, also a little oregeno and sweet italian peppers w/ onion while browning the sausage is nice

Delicious and easy!! I made a few modifications...I did not use olive oil, reduced chicken broth to 8oz, added 1 can tomato sauce. Instead of using frozen chopped spinach, I  coarsely chopped 6 oz. fresh spinach (one bag) and I also substituted 10 large fresh basil leaves for the 1 tsp. dried basil. Lastly, I added some fresh cracked pepper and red chile pepper flakes to give it pizzazz. We thoroughly enjoyed it!

I made it as was written with the exception of using fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach. My family said it's different but wasn't really that crazy over it. Maybe if I used heavy cream to thicken the sauce would've made a difference so they would really enjoy it as others have done?

This was really good! I used a combination of sweet and mild Italian sausage and Penne for the pasta. Cut broth to 1 cup, used fresh spinach and little Cherub tomatoes instead of can of diced tomatoes - added the tomatoes at the very end so they didn't get soft, just warm. I used Gourmet Garden brand (in the tube) for both the garlic and basil. Very flavorful. I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this, using bow-tie pasta and bratwurst in 1/4-inch slices.  I added one tablespoon Italian seasoning and skipped the basil and parmesan.

Great recipe.Though I made some changes. For instance I used Mayonnaise in it and used sesame oil instead of olive oil. Doesn't make much difference, it's just how I prefer. Great job and thanks.

Love the flavor but the sauce it too runny. Tried cooking without covering and it didn’t really help. Not enough liquid for soup but not thick enough for what my family likes as pasta sauce.

As others suggested, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Other than that I stuck with the recipe and it was great!  This recipe's a keeper :)

I've made this many times and found it a refreshing departure from tomato sauce based recipes. Thanks for sharing it.

This is a terrific recipe!!!  I spent time earlier in the day chopping the tomato, basil, garlic, onion and spinach so I could add them quickly.  I highly recommend, as others have posted, to not add the whole can of chicken broth--maybe 1/2 the can at most.  I also used fresh spinach and a large fresh tomato.  Once the pasta is cooked and drained, you can add it to sausage and veggies, let it simmer, and then the broth will cook down some.  The flavors blend wonderfully in this dish!!!

This was very easy and fast. I found it lacking in some flavor. I did not, however, have the spinach to add, and that may have been a key missing ingredient. I definitely enjoyed the ease of this recipe and the fact that I had the ingredients on hand.

Loved this one! Used a full pounf of gemelli pasta, Italian chicken sausage out of the casing, fire roasted tomatoes, added some baby bella mushrooms sliced. What a very tasty and easy one pot meal. Hearty and delicious. Family loved this one. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good except that I felt the chicken broth made it kind of soggy, like a little to much excess juices. I would make it again but cutback on the broth.

This was really pretty good - would have been better if I'd had the spicy sausage (I could only find the mild)... I think the addition of some red wine or even a bit of sherry near the end of the cooking process would have bolstered the flavor just a bit... Will definitely make again.

Really liked this, I served it on multi grain rice and used one more can of tomatoes. Will be making this again. I will try it as well with chicken and or shrimp, just a healthier choice than the sausage.

I love making this! Everyone loves it and it's easy to make. I like to add a bit to f heavy cream to thicken it up and my husband likes to add mushrooms. Make this all the time, it's a family staple.

This is such a flexible recipe!  I used Hillshire Farm Beef Smoked Sausage, Bowtie Pasta, Snow Peas (to added a little crunch + I was out of spinach) and Hunt's Fire-Roasted & Diced Tomatoes with Garlic as replacements.  It was a big hit!

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times and even passed it along to my mom.  The first time I made it, I thought I had spinach in the freezer, but it was broccoli instead.  I used the entire bag of broccoli and I also used angel hair pasta.  The broccoli was still somewhat crunchy to the taste and it fit in well.  I've yet to try this recipe with spinach, but definitely a winner.

This is one of the best recipes I have pulled from this site.  The whole family just loved it.  Since I didn't have spicy Italian sausage on hand, I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper and it turned out great.

I used fresh spanich instead of frozeon spanich, and followed the recipe exactly. It turned out wonderful! Since spanich cooks so fast, the only other change I would make is to toss in Spanich last. Otherwise, great recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

I like this recipe.  I actually make it a BIT faster by purchasing the frozen already cooked Italian sausage by Johnsonville and cut that in slices.  I love anything quick, and this really tastes fresh.  My husband and I like the simplicity of it!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Will certainly make again. Made it with fresh spinach and fresh tomatoes. Placed in fridge for a couple hours so it would thicken a bit. Followed another reviewers advice and put the spinach in the coriander before placing the noodles in to rinse. Used Jimmy Dean HOT ground sausage. Delish!

Amazing! My little sister and I made this for our parents for dinner, and it was so much fun to make and tasted good as well. It's light and has a really nice balance of colors. We ate it with garlic bread :) Will definitely make this again! If you are looking for something to make for dinner, you have found the right dish!

This was so good.  The spicy sausage really flavors it.     I followed another reviewers suggestion and cut the sausage casing off. The sauce was very watery so I added a can of tomato paste before simmering for about 20 minutes.

Don't deviate from the original ingredientportions.  They may appear to be a lot at first but in the end it all works out well. We used 2 spicy Italian sausages and 2 sweet Italian sausages. Either one will work with this dish but I'd recommend sticking to one or the other.

This recipe is definetely a keeper! Was a little unsure about the liquid mixture not having enough flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I added fresh mushrooms and even used fat free chicken broth and whole grain penne noodles. It makes alot, so this is an excellant recipe to make for a big crowd. Will be eating this again real soon!

We loved this recipe at my house! I used hill shire farms dinner sausage. I also added olives (it just sounded good to me) and used only half of the spinach. The only other thing I changed was I added to teaspoons of flour to the chicken broth before mixing it in to make the sauce thicker. A fantastic quick and easy meal. Thanks!

I made it as directed and found the sauce to be too watery for my taste.  I'll try it again maybe adding some tomato sauce, or cream, as another reviewer suggested, to add to the saucyness.

I have a big family (four kids) and two of them complain about everything but they weren't complaining last night.  My one son had three servings of this dish so it is a WINNER in this house.

I used fresh spinach vs. frozen (threw it in last minute) and I also used fresh basil because I think it gives meals a fresher taste.  Because I have children, I used mild Italian sausage rather than a spicy one but it was still outstanding.  It looks like we have another favorite from allrecipes.com.

I added this recipe into my recipe box awhile back and forgot about it until I was searching for something different tonight.  I decided since I had everything on hand to go with this and WOW.  I used reg sausage and threw in some red pepper flakes, used a cup of water w/better than bullion, used fresh spinach and did what another reviewer said and just drained my pasta into the spinach in the strainer, and I also tossed in some zuchini, red peppers, and yellow peppers-oh and fresh basil.  I didn't even bother with the cheese.  I found it had a ton of flavor.  I cooked awhile without the lid to cut the liquid back a bit but there was still a lot, you just have to scoop out the pasta mixture into another bowl to limit the liquid while serving.  Super fast and just awesome, definitely a keeper!   Thanks for sharing!

While this was a pretty easy and a fast meal, I was disappointed in how much liquid I had even after I let it reduce.  I think next time I may use less chicken broth.  Also, it definately needed salt.

This was incredible and so easy!! The kids loved it and asked for seconds! We did not have sausage on hand, but had lemon chicken breast. So instead of heading to the store, opted to try with the cooked breasts (cubed) and thought it was great!! This will be a regular meal from now on!

We love this recipe! I use Hot Turkey Italian Sausage and Barilla Plus Penne to make it a bit healthier. Sometimes I use fresh spinach instead of frozen depending on what I have in the house. I also put Feta and Parm on the table when I serve it b/c I prefer Feta and my husband prefers Parm. This is a delicious dish! Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is awesome.  I increased the tomatoes and decreased the spinach just a bit.  Very good.  Anyone liking this recipe should also try the hot sausage and rice that I posted.  It's always a hit too. Have a great day!

This dish was so simple.  It wasn't out-of-this-world, but it was very good for how easy and fast it was.  There was a lot of flavor in this dish with the sausage and tomatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised with the sauce as well.  It made a lot with little money and the end result seemed a little fancy, which was a little bonus.  We will be making again! The only change I made was added fresh spinach instead of frozen, I add fresh over frozen any day when I have it on hand.

Easy 5 stars!!  I changed absolutely nothing and it is perfect as is!  My 9 year old hates sausage so I made him something else, which was fine with my husband and I because there was more for us!  This is going in my regular rotation of meals.  The only thing I would do would be to maybe add just a little more sausage.

All the family love this one.  When the grandkids come they (4 of them) share making the meal -- some with main dish, a couple with salads, and one loves to get the bread machine going for wonderful fresh bread with dinner.  It is a labor of love with all them in the kitchen with me.

I used the "Dinner Sausage" from Schwan's which was very good in this dish.  Next time I would use only half a box of spinach, the whole box was a little much for me.

this was really good however i did make one adjustment...mainly b/c i'm preggo and the sausage wasn't sounding so good!...i did everything the same but instead of sausage i added fresh mushrooms in addition to the spinach (used fresh) and diced tomatoes.  Even my super picky husband liked this so that is a major plus!...I will keep this recipe around...thanks!

Unfortunately I was disappointed with this recipe.  It tasted like plain pasta with sausage pieces.  I ended up having to add some half and half and then added half a jar of pasta sauce to give it some flavor. I don't think I will try this one again.

Good flavor, and I don't like the vegetables used!  My 18-mo old even had some.  Only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 regular italian sausage and 1/2 hot.  It makes a lot, though!  We will be making this again.

This was just ok.  Sauce never thickened and could've used more spices.  I might try to make again and use less broth.

Great recipe!  I like to try a recipe exactly as printed before I tweak it for my family.  However, after making this recipe I won't be tweaking it at all!  The only recommendation I have is to add a little salt and pepper to taste and let the pasta rest in the sauce for a few minutes to soak up the great flavor.  It was even better the next day for lunch!

Very good recipe.  I made the following changes to use what I had on hand.  I used one pound of sweet Italian sausage links.  I baked them at 325 degrees for 40 minutes, then cut them in half lengthwise.  Then cut each half into four chunks.  I used: a full pound of penne pasta; 2  tsp. garlic powder, no garlic cloves;12 oz. jar of roasted red peppers, chopped, instead of tomatoes; 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, no basil and 2 cups of broth made from Herb Ox Instant Chicken Bouillon & Seasoning.  I also added in a half cup of white wine.  It tasted great and reheated well the next day in the microwave.  It could have used more sausage, but I did use one pound instead of  3/4 pound of pasta.  Thanks for the recipe Tammy!

Nice concept but I was a little underimpressed by this recipe. The broth/tomato mixtured didnt absorb well, the sausage didnt permeate throughout the dish and it lacked flavor. Sorry, but I probably wont make it again.

Very light sauce that really goes well with the spicy sausage and basil. I used fresh spinach and put it at the bottom of the colander before draining pasta. Turned out perfectly wilted. I will try to use fresh basil next time I make this.

I added some chopped zucchini and mushrooms to the onion and garlic, very delish!! After browning sausage I also drained some of the oil. This recipe is very versitile and easy. Lighter fare for your pasta craving.

I made this without tomatoes as nobody in my family likes it and it was quite tasty! I might use less of the chicken broth next time, there was an excess of liquid.

This is a very simple yet tasty meal.  I made it with sweet sausage, fresh spinach and a pinch of red pepper flakes.   My entire family loved it.  I will definitely be making this dish again!  I may even add mushrooms the next time.

I thought that a whole can of chicken broth for 3/4 pound of pasta would make this watery and soupy. So I used only a half can.  I still had to cook it down for quite awhile, because there is way too much liquid. I think that deleting the chicken broth and adding a little white wine would be better.  I used ground mild Italian turkey sausage and added red pepper flakes to it. I used four big handfuls of fresh spinach that I threw in, at the end of cooking the sauce. Thought this was going to be better than it was. Just ok. Wouldn't make it again.

This is a wonderful quick and easy meal.  I, too, used fresh spinach added to the strainer when draining the pasta.  I thickened this sauce a bit with cornstartch and wala.  I'll keep this because so much can be added for variety!

My family really enjoys this recipe. I use fresh spinach, more garlic, bow tie pasta or penne, and when I cut the sausage, I used my trusty kitchen scissors and cut at an angle, reversing sides each time, works like a charm. Thanks Tammy for posting this. It will be prepared often!

Easy and delicious! I buy the sweet turkey sausage and remove the casing before cooking.  I also leave out the garlic as my family is not a fan, and it still tastes amazing!

This is a wonderful pasta dish.  I used Jimmy Dean Italian sausage, fresh spinach, and sliced baby bella mushrooms.  I did carmelize the onions first, added the sausage and drained.  This is a keeper.  Served with garlic breadsticks from Pillsbury.  Lana

I love this recipe. The only change I make is to add a jar of pesto sauce (a non-oily kind) to it before serving. It gives the sauce a nice flavor.

I don't like cooked spinach, so I used green peppers.  And since I made a double batch for a party, I used a combination of hot & sweet sausage.  This was awesome!! I had a ton of compliments & nothing was left for lunch leftovers the next day.  And it was mega easy to make & take.

A delicous week night dinner.  Changes made only due to what was on hand: cut up chicken instead of sausage, a little bit of jar spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes and a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Will be even better with the spicy Italian sausage.

This meal was great!  Easy to put together and the aroma in the house was wonderful.  I used fresh spinach and basil and a mix of fresh shredded Romano, Asiago and Parmesan cheeses.  Will be making this again!

This was delicious! I only made a couple changes.  I used whole wheat penne and I also threw in some sun dried tomatoes in addition to the diced tomatoes. There was quite a bit of liquid after cooking as directed.  (I'm assuming it was from the frozen spinach).  So I took the lid off and cooked for another 5-7 minutes to reduce.  This one is a definite keeper!

This was pretty good, next time I'll crumble the sausage and I'll also thaw and drain the spinach.  This was very good as leftovers.

Very good.  I used frozen cut leaf spinach and it came out just fine and no need to thaw and squeeze out water.  I can also imagine making this a creamy sauce by adding cream cheese or something.  Will make again.

This dish is easy to make and taste so good. I followed the exact instruction, but I use a can of tomatoes with gree chile; and spice up the meat with red crush pepper. BTW, I don't have whole pound of Italian hot sausage, so I mixed with pork Italian sausage. Instead of fresh spinach, I used frozen spinach. Very good recipe, thank you very much.

I made this for dinner, everyone from my 4yr, 6yr,10yr & dad loved it!!! I used sweet  saugage in place of hot for the kids. I pulled most of the sauce out and reduced in a small sauce pan. Added a little salt & pepper it was so good... I really can't wait to try this with different veggies.  My boys ate spinach & asked for more.

Used Penne pasta and mild italian sausage.  Optional to add some feta.  This makes more than enough to feed 4 adults.  Serve with salad and garlic bread.  Very tasty.  Easy to make and quick.  I'd definatly make this again.  ~Michele Page~

This was pretty good.  And was pretty easy to make.  I had a can of diced tomatoes with basil so I skipped the basil but I don't think that is a real deviation from the recipe.  I think I'll use mild sausage next time as the kids complained about the spicy.

My husband and 14 month old son loved it. I made 4 servings and they ate everything. My husband and son usually do not eat that much, but they kept on taking more helpings. I was not crazy about it, but I am giving it 5 stars just because of their response to it

DEFINITE KEEPER!  .. Followed the recipe "almost" exactly ...the only difference was I added my own preferred seasonings and I also threw in a jar of roasted red peppers since for my family I was pretty much doubling the recipe anyway... I agree with a previous reviewer that it's a lot of liquid I had to cook off for a while ...so I would use less liquid next time ...but everyone LOVED this and it reheats well also.

Easy.  I used Rotel instead of tomatos so it was very spicy.  I didn't add spinach so it was more kid friendly and instead added 1 pkg. of mozarella cheese and sprinkled some cheddar cheese.  Family said it was a keeper.  Next time I will use the tomatoes it calls for.

Very good, easy, and quick meal. I did not have spicy Italian sausage so I used mild and then added ground cayenne pepper. I also quarter sausage during cooking. Like another reviewer, I thought it lacked salt and added to taste (I used low sodium broth). Finally, I added about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning to pot and crushed red pepper to my plate to give it more of a zip. These additions completed the spice compliment for me. I may try cream in the future with parmesan to create a bit of an alfredo as a variant to this recipe. A keeper which can be modified/varied according to taste, both during cooking and just prior to serving.

Made this last night for super and it was WONDERFUL.  I followed directions exactly and added a bit more of the cheese.  My hubby loved it.  This was more than 4 servings more like 6 to 8 because i have a bunch for leftovers and we will heat this stuff up today for lunch.  Thanks for this one.!!

This is a very good recipe and simple.  I have an abundance of sweet basil and spicy basil in my garden, so I substituted approximately 1/2 cup of spicy basil and 1/4 cup of sweet basil in place of the dried basil.  I sliced the basil into small pieces and I also used about 1 cup of fresh spinach, also cut up into small pieces, in place of the frozen spinach.  My kids are used to their pasta being covered in some kind of red sauce, but they really liked tonight's dish and said they would like it again.

Made some changes. As I didn't have spinach, and did have green peppers, used those. As well. I had about 3/4 lb of 3 cheese tortellini (ricotta, romano, parmesan. I used that rather than the plain pasta. Also used 3 large fresh tomatoes, skinned and seeded rather than canned, chopped those up. So by the time I was finished, it was rather  a different recipe. It was fantastic! I used some chile pepper powder for the spicy, as the bulk sausage was not spicy!  My much better half declared it to be one I should do again! Sorry Tammy, for changing your recipe so drastically! But it was worth it, and had you not posted it In would not have had it!! Thanks!

This was really good.  I didn't have any penne pasta on hand so I just used what I had, which was rotini.  Still came out delicious!

This has become a regular in my weekday dinner rotation because it is easy and very tasty.  I like to use fresh spinach instead of frozen and also usually throw in some mushrooms.  I usually thicken it a little with flour or cornstarch.  Turkey sausage is a good way to lighten it up and cut out some of the fat and grease.

You could also just buy ground pork and add sage, and whatever spices you like to make the sausage...  This also gives the added benefit of omitting the nitrites that are so prevalent in the pre-packages sausages!

This was a very good dish - I give it a strong 4-star rating. I wasn't sure what form of sausage to use (sliced? ground?), and wound up using ground "hot italian sausage". Likewise the pasta offered a lot of choices; I had only spaghetti on hand, so I used 3/4 pound of it, broken in half to make it easier to handle. After that, I made this exactly as written. With my choices, this was pretty easy to make, tasted great (even as leftovers), and moreover looked very visually appealing - a great dish to share with others. Thanks!

This was tasty. I added 2 Tbsp of tomato paste and some pepper to the sausage & the broth. I had no onion so I left that out. I used green beans instead of spinach since we don't like spinach. When it was all done, I sprinkled the top with lots of parmesan cheese. Delicious!

This was really good. I left out the tomatoes (don't like) and used tomato paste. I also felt it needed some more liquid so I added a little half n half.

This is a great dish and surprisingly light for a pasta dish. It was bit watery/liquidy for me, so I recommend adding a tbsp or two of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Definitely making it again.

Made this for dinner tonight after reading all the great reviews. My husband and I were not impressed. I followed the directions almost exactly, adding some sliced mushrooms, but only putting in 1/2 a package of spinach, and it still tasted very spinachy, plus it was very watery. I think the major complaint was that the flavours didn't blend very well together - it tasted like all the ingredients individually rather than a nice combination. I have a ridiculous amount of leftovers, so I'm hoping a jar of spaghetti sauce will save it.

Great easy recipe! I used turkey sausage and fresh spinach and it tasted like a recipe from an Italian restaurant. My 11-year-old daughter ate the leftovers and she doesn't usually like leftovers. I put this one in my recipe box. We have already made it twice in a week.

Oh my gosh - this stuff is outstanding. Next time I'm going to make the pasta a little more al dente and use a touch more salt - but WOW. This will be a regular dish around here from now on. Just add diced potatoes and this is also a dead ringer for the "Zuppa Rustica" at Olive Garden.

Fast and easy. We made it vegetarian by using soy sausage franks by Morningstar Farms and veggie broth. Just as good and hearty with a fraction of the salt and fat.

This was easy and delicious!  I substituted kielbasa for the Italian sausage and grilled it on the grill before slicing and adding to the pan.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen...cooked just long enough to soften.  Will certainly make again.

This was very easy and pretty tasty.  My husband really liked it.  Next time I will use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  It makes WAY more than 4 servings, though.  We had a large dinner and enough for at least 4 additional servings.

Like all other recipes I modified. I used chicken and shrimp instead of sausage. I did not have sausage. Also I used potato water (my grandma told me to never throw away the water used with potaoes) which is a natural thickening agent. It was a little watery, so I too cooked it for 15 minutes and did have to add a little cornstarch. Thanks for the this foundational recipe. It turned out really good!! Have a 6 and 4 year old who loved it.

I gave 5 stars bc of some modifications I made.  It probably would have been a little watery so I allowed it to reduce for 15 minutes and added lust a little flour to thicken the sauce.  I also added some chopped roasted red peppers.  I didn't have any frozen spinach, so I had to use canned.  It was great!  My 5 year old son ate it up and my husband (who is a pasta critic, lol) LOVED it.  Next time I will use italian turkey sausage, for the fat content.

Had extra sausage on hand, half sweet & half hot, about a lb but next time will use more. Easy to make and the only changes I made was I used beef broth rather than chicken, used diced tomatoes with garlic, onion & oregano and added a pinch of red pepper flakes with black pepper. Turned out excellent, kids and husband loved it. Definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe tonight and it was delicious!  I found it looking for a recipe for sausage and pasta.  It was quick and I had all the ingredients for it in my freezer and cabinets.  My husband and my 4 year old and 2 year old sons loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty.  I will substitute turkey sausage next time though, to make it healthier.  I will also cut back on the basil a bit.  I used a teaspoon of freeze-dried, and it was kind of overpowering.

WOW- I loved it!  My daughter and husband thought too much salt (I used boullion because I had no broth) and my 6 year old got it down but not without much coaxing- he didn't like the looks of it. I did add the red wine also like some others suggested.
All in all- a 4 star and a repeat most likely-

Just made this dish and really enjoyed it. I used asparagus instead of spinach, and added a dash of red wine (as was suggested by others). I used Italian seasoning, instead of just basil. This was deeeee-lish!

Very easy to prepare and delicious.  I used fresh basil (1 tsp chopped) and fresh spinach.  Whole family loved it.  Will make again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Easy and tasty. Will definitely make this again. Added some smoked paprika to the mix to give a little more flavour. As with another reviewer, I also added 10 aspargus tips. Apart from the grease of the sausages, a healthy meal.

Great simple recipe. I didn't have any spinach so I followed a fellow cook's suggestion and put asparagus instead and. I omitted the canned tomatoes and added a bit more broth instead and I used whole wheat spaghetti. I will definitely do it again, but I'll try it with spinach next time.

My whole family loved this. I was in a hurry so I used chopped garlic in the jar, no oil, and just let spinach heat in the skillet till hot at end then mixed with noodles. Everyone wanted seconds and left overs the next day. We used egg noodles, they come in 3/4 pound packages and also added extra salt and pepper. Thank you for this great easy recipe.

This was pretty good, but now where in the recipe or any of the reviews could I find any mention on how to serve the sausage.  Do you take it out of the casing before cooking?  Cook and serve whole?  Cut into pennies?  Well, I cut the sausage into pennies and that seemed to work out okay....I think there was too much spinach.  If I make it again I will cut that about in half.....otherwise it was pretty good  and pretty fast to make.  Thanks! 4/09...  I must update my review after reading some of the others and making this again tonight.  Thanks to all of the suggestions of other reviewers I made the following huge improvements: 1)took the sausage out of the casing and broke up the meat & 2)used a big handful of raw spinach instead of frozen. It was a big hit and still very easy to make.  The result was very flavorful.  Thanks again!

This recipe was amazing!!! Everyone in my family loved it and that almost never happens because my 15 yr old is such a picky eater. I used 1/2 package of spinach instead of a whole but other than that I stuck to the original recipe and the results could not be beat. It tastes even better the next day.

It was very good. I liked how the noodles soaked up the sauce. I used Mizzthra cheese instead to add an extra kick.I will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too salty. But I loved all of the ingredients, so I played with it a little. I sauted sausage, then added the onions,mushrooms and garlic. I added a can of tomato sauce and fresh basil, and only used 1/2 of the chicken broth and the rest was pasta water. The parmesan cheese I only used once I put on the plate. I will make this recipe again now!!!

This was amazing! I substituted turkey sausage to make it a bit healthier, and whole-grain pasta.

Enjoyed this a great deal. Added dried oregano as well as a little jarred spaghetti sauce and cayenee pepper since my Italian sausage was mild flavored. Served over penne pasta.

This went over GREAT with my family! I didn't have spinach so I added chopped (small) broccoli instead.  I'll make it again and again.
