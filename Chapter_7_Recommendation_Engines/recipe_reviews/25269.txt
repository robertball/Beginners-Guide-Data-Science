For an EASY and LOW-FAT version, I used canned lima beans, canned tomatoes, and canned creamed corn. I omitted the butter, salt, and sugar, and just added some garlic powder instead. This was great hot or even cold (served as a summer salad dish)!

I wanted to make something with Lima Beans so the ingredient search showed up this recipe.  The recipe looked rather bland, but I decided just to try it anyway.  I'm glad I did!  

Here was my version since I had nothing fresh on hand.  Since I was feeding 6 people I used 3 cups frozen lima beans, 2 cans diced tomatos (with juice), 2 cups of frozen sweet corn, 1 stick of butter, seasoning salt, pepper and a touch of onion powder to taste.  I simmered the limas first with the stick of butter until tender (15-20 min), added tomatos, corn, 2 packs of Splenda and seasonings.  Simmered on low for another 15 minutes and Voila!  Every last bite was thoroughly enjoyed by all ... thanks!

I used shelled edamame in place of the lima beans -- Not because I don't love limas, because I do, I just didn't have any. It turned out great with the edamame.  I can't wait to try it with limas:)

I wanted to make this ahead for Thanksgiving.  I thought it sounded wonderful when I was reading it.  It did turn out wonderful.  I cannot wait to serve it to my guests.  I do have a suggestion, however...  Make it when fresh corn and tomatoes are in season.  I used fresh corn and tomatoes but had to buy frozen lima beans.  I doubled the recipe and with the vegies being out of season, spent about $20.00 just to make it.  That's ok this one time - it's a special occasion and everyone is going to love it!  I had to find out how to skin the tomatoes, because I didn't know.  You wash them and remove the stem.  Boil a pot of water deep enough to cover the largest tomatoe.  Have a container with ice water with ice floating it it ready - also enough to be able to submerse all of the tomatoes you plan to do.  Cut a small shallow x on the bottom of each tomatoe.  Put them in the boiling water, doing 1 at a time, for 30 seconds (really, just 30 seconds), and them put them in the ice water for 5 minutes.  They came out beautiful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!  However, though I used the same ingredients, I scaled down the recipe by half and then only used half of the amount of butter than was called for.  I started one cup frozen lima beans in 1/4 cup (half a stick)of butter in a skillet over medium-low heat for about 10 min, then I added two peeled and chopped tomatoes, the sugar, and one cup frozen corn and simmered it in the same pan for about another 20 minutes. I fail to understand why two pans are needed to prepare this dish.  Still, the flavor was sooooo good and the vegies retained their texture (except for the tomatoes).

This is a great side dish!  I cut this in half since it was just for two of us.  I used frozen lima beans and canned corn, which worked just fine in this recipe.

OMG! I used all fresh local produce and real  butter! I only made half the recipe and wish I had made the whole thing. SO GOOD! Like another reviewer I did not use two pots. Cooked the beans about 10 minutes and then added the tomatoes for 10 more. Then the corn for about 5 I couldn't wait any longer to eat it! YUM!

I have made this recipe about 4-5 times since finding it.  While we really like it (obviously), I have made some adjustments and thought I'd share.  I originally tried canned tomatoes based on a reviewer.  Bad idea.  The taste is just not the same.  Stick to the original recipe's fresh tomatoes-for which now I'll only use Roma tomatoes.  I have come to substitute the fresh corn and lima beans with frozen if I need to be fast, but two of my kids will not eat it if I've used canned corn or canned lima beans.  The textures are completely different.

Yummy Yummy!  I hated peeling the tomatoes, maybe I'll just use canned next time.  I scaled the recipe for 4 servings, and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Hubby loved it!

This was delicious and I love that it is packed with nutrition, but I made it with a 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of a cup of butter. And even that seemed excessive. I might try half that next time. I used frozen lima beans (all I could find), a can of diced tomatoes (didn't feel like peeling fresh tomatoes), and fresh corn--just two ears, because they were big, and the proportions seemed right that way. I also used the one-pot method--10 minutes for beans then 20 after adding the tomatoes and corn. Texture was great--just a little crunch. My toddler refused to eat the lima beans, but my husband and I loved it.

Quite good. An excellent dish for Harvest Season, when you can get everything fresh. I added some dried basil & red pepper flakes, which worked well. Next time, I'll add some squash, as that was part of the traditional Succotash made originaly by Native Americans. Corn, beans & squash - the "Three Sisters", as they were reffered to. This a great version that can be adapted in many ways.

Delicious!! I typically don't think a person should rate a recipe that they did not follow, but I had a few garden fresh ripe tomatoes and a pantry full of canned veggies. Looking for something a little different. I used canned corn and Lima beans, and only 2 tbsp. of butter. Same amount of salt and sugar. It was wonderful. Will definitely fix this one again!!

Everyone enjoyed this side dish. Only turn off was the extraordinary amount of butter. Would make again for sure, but definitely use at least, if not less 1/2 amount of butter for dietary reasons. We used frozen Lima beans, whole tomatoes and canned corn. Other than that tho, veggies blended well together and tasted great and sweet.

Excellent succotash. I decreased veggies to about 12 oz each and used frozen corn and limas, barely cooked. Didn't have any fresh tomatoes so we used 1/2 can tomatoes  with chilis, drained.  The succotash was colorful, very tasty and pretty spicy.

It was okay.. .probably since I didn't follow using fresh lima beans or corn (used frozen instead). But it was good and I'll probably make again.

I love love love succotash. This recipe was great, except for the large amount of butter it called for. I left the butter out. I added 1 t of chopped dehydrated onions, some thyme, and fresh ground black pepper.

Wonderful comfort food!  The tomatoes make this dish.  I even add more tomatoes when I make it.  Next time I may use some green beans for a variation.

This was great.  I had it over whole wheat linguine noodles as a main dish.  I cut the butter in half and only made it in one pan with canned Great Northern beans and frozen corn.  Because I used canned beans, I just added them a couple of minutes before I added the corn.  Phenomenal.

Simple and delicious! I didn't have fresh veggies on hand when I first prepared it, but canned worked well (2 cans each of lima, corn, and diced tomatoes drained). Definitely a keeper for a quick and satisfying side!

As written this has way too much butter and a little too much sugar in it for my taste.  I cut the butter in half, next time I think I'll cut the sugar in half too.  However, with those changes we loved it.

I used frozen vegetables, and messed up a few things like adding the corn when I was supposed to be simmering the tomatoes, regardless of all that this is a great, quick, and easy recipe. Thanks!

I'd give this recipe four stars but there is way too much butter.  I used 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 Tbsp. soft margarine which is enough for a buttery taste but butter could be omitted entirely as suggested by another reviewer.  Great combo of vegetables.  What's not to love?

Four stars because I changed the recipe...half the butter but used all fresh ingredients....I love the sweetness the sugar adds and I used the one-pot method.

Didn't really like this. Scaled down to 4 servings. Added red & orange bell peppers, green onions, tiny bit of hot pepper, tomato, fresh garlic and a few teaspoons of Parmesan. Skipped the sugar and salt. Perhaps it was too much butter, cooked a bit too long and I'll skip out using cheese if I make this again.

A great and simple version of succotash. Had I not been so stuffed with everything else, I might have enjoyed it more. Lots of leftovers for tomorrow, though ... and then I'll really enjoy it!

I'm used to succotash with corn, tomato and grn beans, this was a nice change. Hubby loved it, 1 year old loved it, 3 year old did not. I WILL make this again. Used 16 oz frozen limas, 2 whole tomatos, 2 cups frozen corn. Only used 2 Tb butter, and added some garlic. Made in ONE pot. YUMMY, thanks Michele

I had no idea it would taste so good! Except I made these changes to suite my own personal tastes: only 1 stick butter, just eyeballed the salt and pepper, added onion powder and garlic powder, I actually forgot to put the sugar in so next time I'll try it w/. Also, only use 2 tomatoes. And I had a small bag each of frozen corn and lima beans but this recipe was awesome.

This recipe was wonderful.  Since my husband requested succotash, and I am not crazy about limas by themselves, I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  We had frozen our own lima beans and corn over the summer, and I just estimated all the amounts with a can of tomatoes and about 2/3 cup butter.  We also added a little marjoram for seasoning.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe with fresh corn, frozen butter beans and canned tomatoes.  It was great!  I made it all in 1 pot, and I also added some onion powder and a little paprika.  It was great!  I made it for 3 servings and wish I'd made the whole recipe, since I have the feeling it will only get better after sitting overnight. Thanks!

This was VERY good. I made it this past weekend to see whether or not I wanted to include it in my Thanksgiving dinner offerings this year. Decision: YES! I used frozen Baby Limas, frozen Niblets corn and fresh tomatoes. I did not include garlic as others suggested (at least not this time; too many "flavors" in T-day already) but I probably will next time (and there WILL be a next time). I think the tomatoes make the dish. Opinion? Don't even think about leaving them out.

This was absolutely delicious!  It was easy to make and a big hit with my friends.  The only problem was that there was a lot of butter that really wasn’t needed.  Next time I will cut the amount by half.

This was my first time making succotash. I made half of the recipe. I hate lima beans, so I used small bites fresh green beans, I had fresh tomatoes but no fresh corn. I used shoepeg instead. I cooked the green beans first in the butter, then took them out. Added the rest of the ingredience except the sugar.Also added diced zucchini  Tastes wonderful

Added a little more sugar and some lawry's seasoning salt and this was perfect. I cooked it Wednesday before Thanksgiving just in case i needed a replacement. The family ate it on Wednesday. Thanks, this one is a keeper.

This was my first venture with lima beans.  The recipe was okay (hence the 3 stars) - not spectacular, not offensive.  My lima beans got away from me a little bit as they simmered in the butter so some of them were bordering on the well-done side but all things considered, the recipe seemed to come out as it was supposed too.  Because of the nutiousness of lima beans, I'll probably try them again, but next time, with a different recipe.

This was REALLY good! I took the advice from 2 other posters and served it over pasta and added dried basil and red chili flakes. I made a pot of lima beans (dried) and stumbled upon this recipe as what to do with them. I'm so glad I found it! I used 2 cups of my cooked lima beans, a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of corn, with half a stick of butter and the same amount of salt and sugar as written. I'm am about to serve myself a second helping. Thanks for the recipe!

I did change it up a little as we don NOT like lima beans. So fresh corn, fresh zucchini, fresh onion and fresh tomato all from the garden, half the butter, no sugar and it was absolutely delicious.

This was great with a few adjustments. 4c frozen white corn, 4 small zucchini diced, 1 red pepper diced. Keep butter and sugar the same. Skip the lima beans. Great for a person cooking for people that dislike lima beans.

I made this for my daughter's class for Immigration day. It turned out great! I didn't change anything except to double the ingredients. Wasn't sure if kids would like since it was vegetables but she said it was a hit!! And no leftovers came back.??

I have made this many times and I love it  but I make mine slightly different, I can't eat tomatos so I have to omit that. I use 3 tablespoons of butter, I can of drained baby limas, 1 can of drained corn, 1/2 cup cream  & 1 scant tablespoon sugar (I actually use Splenda) and heat it all up together until the corn has absorbed most of the cream. Different  & Delicious. Tonight I will try it with canned hominy  instead of canned corn

I found this amount of butter too much and I didn't particularly like the corn with the lima beans.  I also wasn't fond of the slight sweet taste the sugar gave it.  I made this a second time but omitted the corn, sugar and used half the amount of butter.  I also added a clove of minced garlic and a minced jalapeno.

I made this with all canned veggies and it still turned out awesome! Used seasoning salt instead of regular salt tho. And as others reviewed, use less butter.
