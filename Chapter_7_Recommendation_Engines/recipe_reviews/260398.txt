This was really tasty, but I had to modify as I made it.  Two tablespoons of butter wasn't enough.  I went with four and added some garlic powder to the butter when it melted.  After adding the cauliflower rice and spinach and covering, it wasn't cooking fast enough on low (spinach wasn't wilting after 15 minutes).  I had to put my burner on medium high and stir uncovered.  I really enjoyed the dish.

This is simple and wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and the family loved it.  The time of 15 min is also accurate (which is unusual on this site for me).  It has a mild flavor, which makes it perfect as a side with heavy flavor in the main dish.  This has a lot of potential as a base recipe to add a variety of spices, cheeses, or veggies to increase flavor if wanted.  Thank you for sharing!

Was looking to add some veggies to my  keto creamy curry and didn't have a food processor so I grated the cauliflower. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and used coconut oil instead of butter and that really complimented the dish.

I didn't add my spinach until the very end because... well I had to get my hubs to eat it. This was pretty good. I felt it needed something more though but I cannot put my finger on what it was. Crushed red chili flakes maybe? I don't know?
