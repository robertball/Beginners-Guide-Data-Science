Wow - this recipe deserves more than five stars. It's amazing - rich and decadent. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10 x 15 jelly roll pan. Next time I think I'll use a 9 x 13 pan and get a thicker bar. I did use more raspberry preserves than the recipe called for, and added about 1 cup of flaked coconut to the preserves. Next time I make them, and there will most definitely be a next time, I will spread the preserves to about 1/4 inch from the edge of the bottom crust. I spread them all the way to the edge this time, and it made getting them from the pan a little tricky. For such amazing flavor and texture, this recipe was amazingly quick and easy. Thank you for sharing it!

I went to a catered party and they served these almond bars that everyone was raving about.  I came home and searched by ingredient on the site and found this recipe.  This is it!!  These bars are so delicious and easy to make.  They are elegant - very pretty with the ribbon of jam in the middle.  Nice for a simple snack or for a more formal occasion.  Connie, thank you so much!!

very rich and decadent! Doubled the recipe and baked in a 10X15. Used seedless red raspberry jam. Thanks Connie!

I made this recipe 3 times in 3 weeks each time to rave reviews and pleas for the recipe.  I doubled each batch and baked on a cookie sheet.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe to a t- I learned quickly, like other reviewers that increasing the jam creates a lucious and moist bar.  Thanks so much!

Wow were these buttery and way too sweet - and this coming from someone who previously thought there was no such thing as "too sweet".  I might try again and decrease the amount of butter and chips.

This is the same recipe as "Almond Raspberry Diamonds" on this site.  Either way, the recipe is fantastic.  I have made it no less than four times in the past three weeks for various holiday events.  I always double the recipe.  I pretty much make it as-is written, with just a touch more flour (just enough that my batter is nice and thick).  I've found that this reduces any chance for "butter fingers" when you're eating them.  
Also be sure that when your baking the bottom crust layer, you get it good and golden brown.....this prevents a the jam and top layer from turning the middle of the bars too gooey.
Funny that with all the white choclolate, there is no white chocolate taste.....unlike other reviewers, I would not make this with other kinds of chocolate.

i thought these were great and so did the friends i made them for... which was most important:).  they were so moist, yummy and easy.  i didn't get any complaints, but personally i would cut the sugar to 1/4c.  the white choco gives a lot of sweetness.  i would also bump up the jam to 3/4c.  i would have liked a little more jam.  i used raspberry jam.  next time i will try lemon curd or lemon bar filling in place of the jam because i think lemon would taste amazing with white choco base.

These turned out very moist and delicious. I added some extra flour.  I will add more preserves next time. I used an 8x8 pan which made the bars thicker and more cake-like.

Heavenly! I have a major sweet tooth, and these hit the spot. I used a premium raspberry fruit spread (3/4 cup - to finish off a jar that I had opened in the fridge). Raspberry goes so well with white chocolate and almond - I think it is the best choice for these. I will probably cut back slightly on the sugar next time, even though they are delicious as is.

Sorry, I didn't think these were good at all. Because I didn't have time to make something else, I had to serve them to my book club and I was a little embarrassed and did not receive one comment on them. My husband thought they were ok but I thought they were WAY too sweet with very little raspberry flavor.

Made these along with 3 other bar cookies for my Nephew's graduation party. Everyone was raving! Asking who made them, what was in them, and could they have the recipe.
Bless You Connie for sharing this with us!!!

I used 2/3 cup vanilla chips instead of 1 cup in both places they were called for and these turned out great!  I agree with others that a little extra jam would be good, but not necessary.  They are fun to make, delicious, and don't take much time!  So far everyone who's tried one has raved about it.  They make a festive Christmas cookie too!

Made this two days in a row for two different functions.  It was incredible!! People couldn't stop eating it.  I used Marionberry preserves. Made one batch with almonds and one without.  Great either way.  Thanks for sharing!!!  It will be a new regular for potlucks from now on.

I made this to take to my family's easter dinner and everyone LOVED it. I used boysenberry jam and it went very well with the white chocolate.

This is literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. Great warm with ice cream. Cut the butter just a little bit.

These bars are delicious.  I used apricot jam instead of a berry jam, and they were wonderful.

This is the second year I have made these delicious treats, my oldest son loves them. He asked if I would be making them... Added 3/4 cup raspberry jam for more flavor. Will try with semi-sweet chocolate chips for a different flavor.

I think the recipe for cherry bars is much better.  For me way to much salt and not enough batter for a 9 x9 pan would be better with a 1/2 tsp or so of baking soda.
