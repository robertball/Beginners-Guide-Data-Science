I made this tonight for dinner for myself and it is very flavorful! The only changes I made were that I had jumbo scallops that I halved and I sauteed the scallops, shrimp and peas in a tiny bit of butter and olive oil. Then just did the rest of the recipe as stated. Very yummy!

This was excellent with a few alterations.  I saute' the Bay scallops instead in 1 Tbsp. Butter and 1 Tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil combined. The Jumbo Shrimp I used were pre-cooked and I used 1/2 cup Olive Oil instead of Corn Oil and added Black Pepper, Oregano and 1/4 cup sliced Black Olives.  I served this for my Appetizer/Cocktail Party and my company being garlic lovers absolutely was astounded by the flavor combination and loved it.  This is definitely a keeper and it is a nice refreshing change for a summer salad :-)

LOVED THIS! If I could of given more stars I would have. Surprisingly delicious with only (8) ingredients! Love the fresh flavor of the celery leaves with the richness of the garlic-oil. I preferred SEARING the scallops in a tsp. of the set-aside garlic/oil (I used a light EVOO), used the shrimp to deglaze pan (the little bit of juice in the shrimp worked nicely for deglazing)and then mixed all. I enjoyed it warm, as well as chilled ...maybe even a little more. Will be making this for company soon! Thank you Lillian for sharing this great recipe!

Wow, this is very nice! I followed the recipe as written and I  recommend this dish to all. I served it as a side dish instead of an appetizer and it complimented my BBQ meal very well.  The celery leaves are a nice touch and adds a unique  fresh flavour with the combination  of parsley & garlic. THX.

I made this recipe according to the directions, not making any changes and I thought it was absolutely tasteless.  I have made many recipes from this site and I have never had a recipe turn out so bad.  I served this at a family get together and everyone was in agreement.  I will not be trying this recipe again.

I'm not so sure that I'll make this again.  I like the recipe idea, I just don't think I cared much for the flavors blended together.  I probably added a bit too much garlic and the oil was just too overwhelming for me.  Perhaps if I tweaked it a bit for my own tastes I might be more gung-ho about it...

I so loved the idea of this salad with its few, fresh,  quality ingredients.  I made it with only one change to begin with, that being using olive oil rather than corn oil.  I was disappointed and surprised, frankly, that when Hubs and I tasted it (while we were working in the kitchen putting all our Super Bowl goodies together) we were very underwhelmed.  It wasn't bad, it was just kind of "shoulder shrugging," very weak in both color and taste.  After adding some celery for crunch and color, a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and some pepper it was very much improved.   (Frankly, no fault of the submitter of course, but neither of us were impressed with the scallops in this.  Once the salad was assembled, tasted and photographed I picked out and discarded the scallops and added  a good deal of  chunky pieces of King crab legs and broiled lobster tail leftover from last night's dinner.  Score!)
