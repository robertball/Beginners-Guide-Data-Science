This pie is delicious! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't make a very full pie. I used a 9in shallow pie plate (as suggested by another reviewer) and it still didn't fill my crust. Next time I make it I will double the recipe and try it in a deep dish crust. Otherwise it was absolutely delicious!!!

Well, I'm doing something I always thought I wouldn't - tell everyone of the adjustments I made!  Ha!  We ended up with a really great pie with a few changes.  It is the two eggs that give it that soft texture, but you only really need one.  Also, I cut the sugar down to only 1/4 cup. The corn syrup is plenty sweet on its own. Your teeth don't curl up from the sweet that way.  It was still plenty sweet.   I also used WHITE Karo syrup, effectively making a vanilla pecan pie. It was GREAT!    Last change that anyone can do to any pecan pie recipe they choose to use:  CHOP the pecans.  I always had had the mindset that the pecans had to be whole to look pretty. They don't. I added 1-1/2 cups CHOPPED pecans (and a little extra) for a positively great pie that is now my daughter's favorite.

made this for Thanksgiving, it was wonderful !! Although my pie pan was too deep, had to transfer my crust into a pie pan that was shallow and smaller, would do great in a shallow 9 inch or full 8 inch pan. Loved how gooey and not dry or too firm this turned out, will make again!

This is the same recipe that I have been using for over 20 years. Just as everyone has said this recipe only makes half a pie, my recipe says at the top (double recipe to fill pie pan).

This was the first time my husband and I had ever made pecan pie.  It turned out very well.  We had been looking for a good pecan pie at restaurants and had been unsuccessful.  Now we don't need to go out because we can make this recipe in a snap!  It's great!

I made this wonderful pie, I  just got it out of the oven, it smells wonderful, it tastes yum, although its still warm , the flavours are lovely, I used 1/2 maple syrup and 1/2 pancake syrup instead of corn syrup just coz i didnt have any.  very quick and easy.  I made the dough myself, its a great dough that can be used for almost every pie and quiche!  1 cup sifted plain flower. 100 grams of butter room temperature. 3 tablespoons of cold water or a bit more if needed 1 teaspoon of salt if used for salti foods like quiche OR 1/4 of cup of icing sugar if used for sweet pies) you may add more sugar if wanted, but normaly pecan pie is sweet so i didnt add  too much in the dough.  to make dough:  add all ingredients apart from the water in a bowl or food processor, mix well, it will turn crummy , then add the water till it forms a dough.  place in pie tin then add whatever mix ur filling the pie in, and bake as instructed for the filling.

The absolute best pie I have ever ate. I was nervous to make a pecan pie, but this one was so easy. I baked it the night before and then just reheated in oven for a few minutes... topped it with homemade whipped cream and ta da... everyone loved it. Even my little brother who doesnt like pecans! Definitely a staple for all of the holidays! Thanks for such a great and easy recipe! :)

i used a ready made Pillsbury Gluten free crust and reduced the sugar amount to 1/4 cup(instead of 3/4cup). This pie is delicious! Perfectly gooey/creamy texture inside with a firm crunchy top. It wasn't clawingly  sweet  due to my sugar reduction. This will be a family recipe staple for Thanksgiving from now on! (I have milk dairy allergies and was happy that it still was amazing without any butter in it)

The recipe did not fill the entire pie so it looked half full when it was done. The flavor is awesome my husband had two slices. Just have to double the recipe next time.

This pie was really good.  I got hooked on pecan pie after I tried it at the casino.  This wasn't exactly the same recipe as the casino's or the store bought ones, but it was still really good.  I might make this again, but I will also keep trying to find the right recipe I got addicted to.  It was a little too sticky and gooey for me though.  But, my husband loved that.

I doubled the recipe upon reading the reviews - and ended up having to make two pies.  (Not that the recipients minded.)  I used nine inch, pre-made, deep dish pies shells and both were filled to capacity.  I didn't eat any (no-dairy diet - I just love to bake) but it got a rave review.

I read the comments about the fill in the regular shell,  and I  prefer a deep dish shell. I used a frozen, 9"  deep dish shell.  Use the same awesome recipe, but to fill the deep shell: Add one more egg (3 total), add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, not flavoring;  Add 3/4 C Brown Sugar (dark or light) instead of white and for additional flavor,  I added 3/4 C  Bourbon.
Or it could have been 1 C Bourbon.
The shell may look full, but the additional vanilla and bourbon will cook away very nicely.
