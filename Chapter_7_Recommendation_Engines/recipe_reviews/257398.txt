The cake was a little crumbly (I couldn't get the butter to the fluffiness desired so that's probably why) but it tasted great and was the perfect non-fussy summer dessert.

It’s a little too sweet, so I might try it with sour cherries next time.

Made this morning. Used the food processor for the batter.   I added about a cup more cherries than asked, no problem.  I might add an egg next time to make it a little lighter.   Overall it was very delicious and  really good with ice-cream.

After the cherry pitting, this was super fast to make. I used my food processor to mix, and instead of regular milk I substituted buttermilk.  I skipped the juice drizzle part. A perfect summertime cake! So happy I found this recipe.

I used home-canned cherries and the syrup they were canned in instead of fresh cherries and juice.  Tastey; but the think next time I’ll add some spices, I think cinnamon, nutmeg or maybe some cardamom that’s hanging out in the back of my cupboard. I was worried after adding all the juice it would be a soggy mess, but it was not, though it did stick to the pan quite a bit.

Easily adaptable to your own tastes, this recipe is simple and makes for a great cake - not too sweet, just the right amount of tart.  I subbed Egg Beaters and a Truvia-blend sugar so it was only 239 calories per serving.  Also added a little homemade vanilla extract.  

It was a touch dry so, in future, I would add an additional cup of cherries and keep those on the side to spoon over the top when serving.    40 minutes seemed about 5 minutes too long on the cook time.

I was not sure about making a white cake without egg whites, but the cake was good.  My coworkers ate it as if they had never eaten cake before.  It's the perfect sweetness. I'll have to remember to buy extra cherries to make juice.
