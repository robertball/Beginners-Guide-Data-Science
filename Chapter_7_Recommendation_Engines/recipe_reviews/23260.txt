This has a good base to work with, how ever I cut the cream cheese, sour cream and soup in half, I added garlic and onion to the meat and salt and pepper to taste. It turned out great, the cream cheese add a good flavor. My 6yr old loved it, and it was quick and easy. Will use in the future.

This recipe was very good and simple to make. It does make quite alot, especially for just me and my husband. But, it turned out to be a good thing, as hubbie ate 90 % of it! He said it was good as a Stroganoff and S.O.S, this from a man who thinks biscuits and gravy are gourmet :) I did halve the amount of cream cheese after other reviewers comments, and they are right. Overall most recipes here do not impress me, but this one was a hit and there was enough leftovers so I dont have to cook when it is 111 degrees here(Phoenix). Good Job!

The whole family loved this! I cut the cream chease to 4 oz but used the full amount called for of sour cream. I also only used 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and mushroom gravy instead of brown gravy! It was good as left overs! Very quick and simple to make! A+

To "liven" this recipe up a bit,I added garlic powder and some chopped onion to the hamburger mixture along with 3/4 cup of red wine. Very tasty

Great basic recipe, but I needed to adjust it.  A 16 oz. pkg of noodles is too much. The recipe needs more seasoning and less creamy stuff.  Here's what I changed:  8 oz. of med. egg noodles; 1.5 lbs. lean gr. beef - brown the gr. beef and add in the gravy mix plus 3 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, fresh ground black pepper to taste and 1 cup of minced yellow onion. Cook that for a couple of minutes and then add 4 oz. (instead of 8 oz) of cream cheese and stir on low heat until incorporated.  Then follow the directions exactly except use 1.5 cans of the cr of mushroom soup.  Hopes this helps others. I like the way that this recipe mixes the ingredients together. Thanks!

Underwhelming.  Although using canned mushrooms and condensed soup save time, the flavor definitely suffers as a result -- there are too many artifical flavors, and not enough fresh ones.  And the creamy base is too heavy, and not savory like Stroganoff should be.

I must admit, this was the best stroganoff I've ever made... I used tip sirloin (in bite-size pieces) browned in garlic and olive oil instead of the hamburger, and it worked great! This is by far the most "decadent" stroganoff I've tasted, very rich! My husband absolutely raved!

My husband absolutely loves this!  It's just the 2 of us so I cut the recipe in half and that still leaves him with a few leftovers for lunch.  I also use reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream.  It still tastes delicious and is so flavorful and rich!

I also cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream in half, I omitted the mushrooms, used only half the gravy mix, and added a little more milk to thin out the sauce and it was still delicious and made a lot.  Very creamy and rich - my roommates liked it so much they ate it the next day without noodles!

The first time I made this (as written) it was way too thick and creamy for my tastes. However, I love this recipe as a base. I agree with some other reviewers that it has too many artificial flavors. The way I like it is with homemade cream of mushroom soup from this site, (though I will use the canned stuff in a pinch) 3 or 4 oz. of cream cheese, maybe 6 or so oz. sour cream (I'm not much for measuring) and I don't usually have brown gravy mix so I use beef soup base and spices. I always use fresh garlic, onions and mushrooms, and more milk to make it the right consistency.

I'm giving it five stars based on these adjustments: I sauteed the ground beef with a small chopped onion and about three cloves of minced garlic. I used fresh mushrooms, only 4 oz cream cheese and only one can of soup (i used cream of celery). Also, I didn't have any brown gravy mix and dissolved two beef bullion cubes in the beef as it cooked. This flavor combination was delicious!

I have made this recipe two times.  The first time, I used the exact recipe found here.  It was good, but not everything described.  The second time, I used 1 1/2 pounds of beef and seasoned it with pepper and garlic salt.  I omitted the mushrooms, and added about 3 tbsp of beef broth.  In my opion, the whole block of cream cheese was a little much, so I used about 3/4 of the block and it was fabulous. Everyone has been asking me to make it again.

I used a can of beef gravy instead of the dry mix, and added chopped sauteed onions and minced garlic.  Because most of the reviewers complained it had too much sour cream & cream cheese, I used 2 TB of each, tasted, and added slightly more sour cream as needed.  I also only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I used low fat cream cheese & sour cream and you wouldn't know the difference.  I also added some worchestshire sauce to taste. I had some leftover flank steak and chopped that up and put in there too. Served over egg noodles.  Hubby went back for seconds and the kids even enjoyed.  I'll be having what little is left for lunch.  Real comfort food for sure.  I will make again.

This was the first recipe I have tried from this site. I was a little hesitant trying this at first because I always seem to get stuck on making the same things for dinner but this recipe was FANTASTIC!! I have a ton left over and will try using some of the sauce over mashed potatoes next time. Per previous remarks on this recipe I used more noodles than the recipe called for.

This was excellent. So quick and easy to make, and then so tasty! As other reviewers suggested, I used only half the cream cheese called for (actually I used neufchatel cheese in order to cut back on fat a bit), and I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. I sauteed the mushrooms and some diced onions together, then browned the meat (I used ground turkey) with them. I added seasoned salt for a little more flavor. I used low fat sour cream and the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. And it was delicious! My boyfriend took the first bite and simply raved. Then later he went back for a huge helping of seconds. I will be making this again. A quick and easy, delicious dinner that only used two pots - a great find!

PROS:  Definitely simple to make and rather quick; Most ingredients are pastry staples; Could easily feed several people;  CONS:  Very bland and unimpressive; Overwhelming cream cheese/cream of mushroom flavor; Hardly an improvement over Hamburger Helper.  I will not make this again.

Very good, and exactly what it claims to be "Simple Stroganoff".  If you are looking to impress a dinner party, this may not be the recipe for you.  But if you are looking for something inexpensive, easy, and tasty...this is great!  Thanks!

This was very good.  I added some chopped onion and minced garlic to the hamburger meat while it was cooking.  Also, I mixed the milk, soup and sour cream to the meat mixture and spooned over the noodles.  Made it even easier.  

My boyfriend loved it and requested I saved it forever, so I guess this one's a keeper.

My family said it was totally delish. I ended up making a double batch, but as I got into the recipe, I totally forgot got to make sure I had double the amount of noodles. Soo I ended up making it as planned and saved half the batch of meat mixture for the next day's lunch. Now I followed the rest of the recipe to a T and have never used cream cheese in stroganoff before and I can say, it really added texture and creaminess. At 1st I really thought it was too saucy but after I used the batch over the noodles, it was fine. Over night of course it thickened and when I reheated the 2nd batch with another bit of noodles I had to add milk to thin it out some, it was fine. Will make again. Thanks

Easy cheap recipe! Very good, but it had too much sauce for me so instead of 1lb of ground beef I added 2 pounds. Delicious!

This recipe was excellent!!  My husband is VERY picky and he even liked it!!  I did leave out the sliced mushrooms and replace them with 6oz. beef broth.  Next time though I will cut the recipe in half!!  It makes a LARGE portion.  Too much for my 2 person family!!  Thanks for this GREAT recipe!!

I'm giving it 4 stars because I had to add some seasonings to make it better and after adding half of the sour cream, soup and cream cheese it looked just fine.  Very good taste.  I followed other suggestions and added salt, pepper and garlic to the beef.  The kids loved it and so did my husband.  I will be making this again.

I gave this a five star because it was GREAT!! I personally think it didn't need as much sour cream as it called for and so next time I'll cut back on that and the cream cheese by a little next time. Other than that AWESOME!!

This was quick and tasty.
I used left over meatloaf. Also, cut
down on some of the soup and cream cheese.
Added fresh mushrooms and green onion (sprinkled on top of serving plate for color).

This recipe was just too rich and had way too much sauce for my husband and my taste.  To cut down the fat, we even used light cream cheese and light sour cream and it still tasted so heavy and thick.  I think if you cut both the cream cheese and the sour cream in half then it would be good.

Delicious!  I made 10 oz. of noodles, used 4 oz. light cream cheese, 4 oz. light sour cream, 1 can of soup and used over 1 cup of milk to thin it down because it was pretty thick.  Sauteed onions with the hamburger and added frozen peas for extra nutrition.  This made plenty and son and hubby ate it up!

This is very easy to make and very creamy.  For me, the cream chesse taste was a little too overpowering.  I'm not sure if I will make it again, but I liked trying a new recipe.  Jessica, thank you for sharing one of your family favorites.

This was so easy....I usually make stroganoff from the Joy of Cooking, which is twice the work.  This went over well with the kids.  Only change was I cut down on the cream cheese and added a touch more sour cream to taste.  Great, easy recipe.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was very tasty and simple. I, too, cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half. I also left out the milk and used water and red wine. When browning the beef, I added a small chopped onion and some garlic, along with salt and pepper. I made everything in one pan and served it over the noodles. My kids ate it so fast they didnt even have time to pick out the mushrooms!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good for a fast, easy dinner. My 5 year old, who won't eat anything, loves it (of coarse, I didn't tell him what's in it, he thinks it's just noodles and milk and hamburger)! We did add some ground black pepper. I didn't have sour cream, and didn't want to run to the store, but it was still great without it.

This is SOS at it's finest !!  Coming from a military family...SOS was a mainstay on our table when I was growing up...and have continued this tradition with my own family - tho..never before had I added cream cheese nor packaged dry brown gravy mix...both were a nice addition - plus...I don't separate the ingredients...everything except what I'm putting it over (noodles or rice or toast..etc) is done in one pan with the sour cream added only within the last ten minutes of final simmer - and I used fresh mushrooms...so did add more milk to reach the consistency I wanted.  Simply Yumbo !!

Was a great recipe.  My wife doesn't usually eat 2 day leftovers, but she was with this.  It tasted very rich and creamy, like it needed more meat and less dairy products, but apart from that was very good.

very good stroganoff.  as reviewers advised, cut cream cheese in half and used about 6 oz of sour cream.  I opted for fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  I make my own gravies, so didn't have the gravy mix on hand.  I substitued a tablespoon of refrigerated beef base I keep on hand.  added a very nice flavor.  I'm sure using the full amount of cream cheese the original recipes calls for would be too rich and heavy for our tastes.  Cutting it back just a bit was perfect.

My family loves this recipe! I've made it a few times now, and when I'm making out the weekly menu, all my kids ask if this is going to be on it.   One night I found myself without a full block of cream cheese. I used the 4oz that I had, and the Stroganoff still turned out creamy. I've also substituted Cream of Celery soup and like that too. This is definitely a keeper! Happy Eating! :o)

I am going to start this off with a big WOW!! I am eating it right now and it is sooo good!!I haven't made stroganoff in a very long time and this is much better than mine. I used rice instead of noodles, halved the amount of cream cheese and added garlic salt to the hamburger. Those are the only things I changed. One thing I wish I would have changed though, is the amount of hamburger. I don't think there is enough. There is a lot of the creamy, wonderful sauce, but not enough hamburger. I would probably add about a half pound more next time and it will be prefect. Oh and another thing I did different was I mixed everything except the rice together instead of two seperate things, and I just served it over rice.

I also cut the cream cheese in half and probably could have reduced the sour cream as well.  It was delicious.  Even better the next day as leftovers.  Next time I'll make it a day in advance and microwave it.

I have a 5 1/2 month old so this was nice because it was easy and fairly quick. However, the flavor was a little bland. You'll definitely need salt/pepper. It also make A LOT!

I was looking to recreate the hamburger stroganoff my mother used to make.  This is quick, easy, delicious and now a regular at out household.  My six-year old loves it!  This recipe produces a generous amount - first night with rice - second night with noodles (for some variation).

I chose to use all of the cream cheese that was called for unlike most users.The only thing I changed was the amount of pasta. 8oz was more than enough with the rest of the ingredients that the recipe called for. Still plenty of left-overs the next night....

Very quick and simple! Unfortunately we are big eaters so I had to extend the recipe. Used  3lbs of ground turkey,  2 large cans of mushroom soup, one packet 1.6 oz of gravy mix, 2 cups of 2% milk, 16oz of cream and sourcream, and maybe a teaspoon of liquid browning to make it a tad darker, and 2 cans of mushrooms and 3 bags of noodles. Unbelievably Delicious,  thanks for sharing  :)

This was a real throw-back to my childhood, and a great way to use up extra ground beef after a bbq and some leftover noodles from something else!  Not a gourmet experience, but tasty comfort food that is easily adaptable to your tastes or what items you have on hand.  Like nearly everyone else, I also only used about half the (light) cream cheese called for, and probably only 6 oz of Low Fat sour cream.  Didn't have milk so I used FF half-n-half and water combo.  I did use both cans of cream soups, which really was more than necessary--but I didn't want to throw any out, either. I totally forgot to add the gravy mix, so I just sprinkled some TexMex Chipotle Spices into the skillet for more flavor.  Omitted the mushrooms (I would have used fresh ones if I had any) and added frozen peas, as another reviewed suggested, which was a good addition. Salt & peppered it liberally. Love one-skillet meals, and this is a good base recipe that I am sure I will come back to again in the future.

I normally make stroganoff that takes about an hour or so, this was done in about twenty minutes and everyone loved it. I didn't use canned mushrooms though, used fresh ones and chopped them up. I added minced garlic and chopped onions, and a little horseradish mustard, it turned out really well!

Delicious and Easy!!! This is close to the recipe that I grew up with.  Though I did modify it a bit.  I added onion and fresh garlic when I browned the hamburger.  Additionally, I used fresh Baby Bella Mushrooms (8 oz.) instead of canned mushrooms.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add fresh Parsley.

Very tasty, filling, rich. 
I sautéed one white onion, a tablespoon of jarred chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon each: salt, fresh ground pepper, onion powder; 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce along with the ground beef for extra depth of flavor and would recommend that you try it too. I suspect it might have been somewhat bland without the extra seasonings. I used a container of fresh sliced white button mushrooms instead of canned, since I had fresh ones on hand.

I'll definitely try making this again in the future, but will try to lighten up the sauce a bit. Perhaps will try using light sour cream, low fat milk, reduced fat mushroom soup, and light cream cheese. We loved the flavor & comforting aspect of this hearty, easy meal. Quick to assemble & cook it, and light years better quality than similar hamburger type boxed dinners.

Served it over egg noodles, with green salads, fresh corn, warm French bread alongside. I'd like to try it over brown rice next time instead. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used whole grain pasta, fresh mushrooms, low fat sour cream & cream cheese and low salt cream of mushroom. After reading other reviewers comments, I cut all of those in half (1 can of soup, 4 oz. cream cheese, etc.) and it made more than enough sauce. I didn't have gravy mix so I used 2 beef boullion cubes mixed in with the milk. Needed something quick that had the ingredients I had to use my mushrooms that were heading south and this did the trick. Easy and tasty enough.

We really didn't care for this.  The texture was off and the flavor was bland.  This reminded me of S.O.S. substituting noodles for the shingle.  If you don't like S.O.S. you won't like this.

Great!  I seasoned the meet with salt, pepper, garlic and some onion.  I doubled the mushrooms (I use fresh sauteed mushrooms when I have extra time).  My picky toddler gobbled it up!  My husband and I enjoyed it as well.  It was quick and easy to make.

Good stroganoff but a lot of trouble to me.  I would rather mix everything together and then serve it over noodles.  I may try it that way next time.  It did taste good though, just not fabulous. And it makes an awful lot, much more than 6 servings.

This recipe was very disappointing.  It was too rich, but at the same time, it was pretty tasteless.  I was shocked by the amount it made.  I only used half of the cooked egg noodles and it made at least 20 servings.

hey folks, use your imagination thats what jessica did when she set out to make a simpler recipe for beef stroganoff. i for one am very happy she shared. so a little more flavor is all we need here,i added onions and minced garlic to my ground beef while browning along with the usual salt,pepper,accent and lawry's seasoning which by the way i add to everthing i cook from meats and veg. to pasta. only used one can mushroom soup and 1/2 cup sour cream with 8oz.of egg noodles. oh,almost forgot i added some frozen peas and carrots to hamburger mix. all in one dish,and we all liked it's easy and satisfying outcome. thanks jessica.

After reading the reviews I changed the following: - Used 2 lbs of ground beef - Used 3/4 of the cream cheese (so 6 ounces) - While browning the ground beef, added garlic salt, pepper and chopped onions (I have dried chopped onions) - After the beef was drained, I added ALL the ingredients (except the sour cream) to the beef and mixed well, then mixed that with the noodles. - I let everybody put their own sour cream on their own portion This was a hit! My husband loved it and ate some more later into the night.

My husband loved it, and I liked it even though I'm not a huge fan of ground beef.  I used about 5 oz of cream cheese instead of 8oz.  I also used lite sour cream and healthy request cream of mushroom soup.  I will be making this again, although I may use only 4 oz of cream cheese next time.  There's so much creaminess that cutting down on cream cheese doesn't make a huge difference, and it helps with the fat and calories too.

I made this recipe today. It was fast and easy to make. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the hamburger while cooking. Then I added more of each after I made it. I added all ingredients together than I added mixture to the noodles . I also used 12 ounces of noodles. It was still creamy and good. I had to add a lot of pepper. It is a liitle bland but I will make again. I will try adding different spices next time. There is way more than 6 servings!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  Great comfort food.  I add some fresh chopped parsley to the egg noodles and serve the stroganoff on top.  Yumm.  Great served with a side of peas.

THIS RECIPE WAS FAST AND EASY, NOT TO MENTION VERY TASTY.  I HAD MY MOTHER-IN-LAW OVER AND SHE LOVED IT TOO.  EVERYONE HAD TWO HELPINGS, BUT I ONLY HAD ONE.  VERY RICH.

I have never been a stroganoff fan, but I tried this recipe because my husband loves stroganoff.  I must say that this was wonderful and is a hit in my family, my children included.  Thanks for the recipe.

Husband really liked this one!  I inadvertently added only one can of soup and still turned out good.  Also added some chopped onion and served over rice, not noodles.  Thanks for the easy but yummy recipe!

This was very good. It had a rich and creamy sauce. I used a dry onion soup mix instead of the brown gravy. The whole family enjoyed this. We will be making again.

For my first time making this, I followed the recipe exactly. My entire family loved it! And I was surprised to find it just as easy as it was stated. For someone who isn't a chef and has very little time to cook dinner, this was a hit. Next time I'll try one of the variations with onion and garlic. I think that would be a good addition.

This was delicious! My whole family loved it! I did as many reviewers, halved the sour cream and cream cheese and used only one can of cream of mushroom soup. Also sauteed garlic w/ the beef and added minced onion too. served over brown rice! Thanks for a great recipe!

Really really yummy! I just salt and peppered the beef real good and then a little more once the sauce was all mixed up. My hubby and brother had seconds. This will now be added to my list of meals

This was really good and tasty. I was looking for a quick way to fix hamburger different and this was perfect. I followed the recipe almost exactly the only changes I made was that I added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the hamburger while it was cooking and I did not have the brown gravy mix so I grounded up one cube of beef bullion into a fine powder. My picky 10 year old even went back for seconds. Will definitely make again.

It's a keeper! We're not big mushroom fans, so I cut out the can of them and reduced the soup to one can and only about half of the gravy packet. Also added salt & pepper, and good to go!

I took the advice of others and only used 4 oz cream cheese, 4 oz sour cream, and 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup. I'm so glad I did. It made the perfect amount of sauce. Also, I used fat free sour cream. This dish was easy and yummy.

We thought this was great! My boyfriend thought that it might taste like hamburger helper, but not even close! The only thing I would change in the future is to use a few less noodles. We loved the rich flavor and will definitely make this again!

We used sausage instead of beef and it added a nice kick.  I thought that 2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup was a bit too much.  Next time I will be using only one can.  All in all a good dish.

This was good and hearty.  I cut the (light)cream cheese and (light)sour cream down to 4 oz each, used only one can of cream of mushroom.  Salt & pepper!  It does remind me a bit like Hamburger Helper, but certainly much better.

UPDATE: This is still my go to meal when I want to make something quick, yummy and filling. It's so easy to make and you can tweek it to suit your tastes.

Tried this last night and the whole family was pleased. My pickiest eater even finished his in a flash! I made a couple changes though. I halved the cream cheese (which was perfect)...I also seasoned my meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also added a bit extra milk to make it a bit smoother and not so thick. Will definently make this again.

I was pretty impressed with this recipe. I've always made mine with more expensive cuts of meat. It was wonderful to not have to spend a lot of money or spend all day cooking and still have the same flavor. I added some onion with the ground beef and added a little burgundy wine.

I made this last night for my family. I love simple meals especially since I work a FT job. On top of the quick and easy factor, my picky eaters (husband and 5 year old daughter) loved it and cleared their plates. My daughter asked me to make this again and was excited to have it again tonight for dinner as leftovers. Simple Hamburger Stroganoff...I bow to you!! :-)

This is a great recipe!  Even the children enjoyed it!  I did make a couple changes-used a little less sour cream, 1 can regular cream of mushroom, 1 can garlic cream of mushroom.  I used neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese-it just makes it a little lighter.  We really enjoyed this!  Will make again!

For what this was, it tasted deliciuos. I usually use sirloin steak for my stoganoff. This was a very simple and much cheaper way to make it. Worth a try.

This was a simple, crowd-pleasing meal for my family of picky eaters. I didn't alter the recipe much. I simply added an extra package of gravy mix to give the hamburger mixture a tad more flavor.

Tasty! Recipe claims to serve 6? I think it could easily serve at least 9 or add a salad, a veggie, and rolls to serve 12! I have lots of leftovers and I am looking forward to them :) Also, pretty inexpensive to make. I think I spent $12 on everything. My 3 year old approves and I am happy ;)Thanks!

Wooo hoooo! I finally found a stroganoff recipe that I love and I am extremely picky. From the first bite I was in love! I followed the recipe exactly. My husband, 8 and 5 year old daughters loved it too! I love the fact that I don't have to use expensive stew meat with this! Thanks a million. Another recipe to add to my recipe box!

I loved this and so did my family! Even my picky 10 yr old asked for 3rds! Very simple a great dish for those quick weeknight dinners. The only thing I changed was I left out the canned mushrooms. I will make this again and again.

I omitted the cream cheese, not only because it wasn't needed but because I didn't have it. I also made my own homemade brown gravy mix. VERY good. There were no leftovers. We ate it all.
EDITED NEXT DAY: My family loved it so much that I'm making it again tonight!

It was very quick and easy so perfect if your time is limited.  However, it was pretty bland so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. I would give it a 3, but since my family liked it, I gave it a 4.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I did make changes-halved the cream cheese, added onions and garlic powder to the ground beef, and a few dashes of worstershire sauce for a more authentic taste.  Liked the addition of the gravy powder, used a turkey one as it was all I had on hand.  Also, only used one can of cream of mushroom soup-hate mushrooms! Also tastes good with cream of chicken soup, too.

This was okay, I think the cream cheese gave it a kind of pastey texture and it needed some garlic salt to boost the flavor. I added some diced onion with it when browning the beef. I also agree with other reviewer that only one can of soup was needed. I think I would skip the cream cheese or cut it way down next time.

super simple to  make. i work nights so i have to make dinner early and set it a side for the kids. so in this receipe i mixed all the ingredients together instead of add  the ones to the noodles. that way the kids just cook the noodles and add the stroganoff to the top. they love it so its a keeper

This was a hearty meal!  I did make some modifications after reading reviews.  I added garlic and onion powder to the ground beef while browning it, omitted the mushrooms as we are not huge mushroom fans, increased the milk to about a cup and a half, used cream of chicken and mushroom soup and 3 ounces of cream cheese.  Had this for dinner with German red cabbage and dark wheat bread.  Awesome!

This is the dish to make when you don't feel like making dinner. Easy and low cost. Definitely suggest adding onions to pop up the flavor a bit, but it is so good.

Easy and tastes great!  I made a low fat version with fat free cream cheese, skim milk, light sour cream and one can of low sodium mush soup. You couldn't tell the difference!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

So easy and tastes great with a little bit of Worcestershire sauce mixed in, about 2tbsp or so.  I doubled the meat and it came out FABULOUS!

I love this dish. I add some chopped onion & minced garlic to the meat as it cooks & then when the meat is almost done, I put in fresh mushrooms. 

I only use 1 can of soup & about half the cream cheese & sour cream. Perfect!

Over all this was great!  I read opinions and decided on 4 oz of cream cheese, 8 oz of sour cream (I used light) and added salt, pepper and a shot of Cambells canned beef broth.  Didn't add milk, we like ours more thick.  Kind of tasted and added as I went so I knew what I was dealing with LOL.  Served over egg noodles.  Thanks

I did have to modify this recipe to work with the ingredients I had on hand. I used cream of broccoli soup, instead of mushroom, an oxo cube and water instead of gravy mix and left out the mushrooms(my kids hate them). Really yummy. I'm sure you could use this basic recipe and adjust it however needed. If you find it too rich, serve it with a nice big green salad. My kids loved this. Very quick, very filling.

Super simple recipe  to throw together  last minute. Makes a lot. I left the mushrooms out (picky eaters) Kind of like a home made version of hamburger helper out of the box . I was a little iffy when I added the cream cheese but it turned out great

This was a GREAT weeknight quick meal... my grandson, who is a VERY picky eater gobbled it up!  It will definitely be one of my "go-to" recipes when looking for something quick and easy.

Very good.  The only thing I added was half of an onion, chopped.  Everyone in the family really liked it.  I’ll add this to our permanent rotation for sure!

I skipped the mushrooms altogether. I substituted cream of chicken and mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom soup.
I also substituted stew beef for turkey.

Next time I will add more milk to make up for the liquid loss from the mushrooms. It was super creamy and definitely ended up needing more milk added to the individual servings.

However the taste was great, easy to make and I will be making this again!

Nice recipe for when you're in a hurry.  I added white wine during the beef Browning process and tons of black pepper towards the end.  Note:  There is a contradiction between the video and the written recipe.  The written suggests you add milk, mushroom soup, and sour cream in to the noodles, and then combine it with the meat mixture.  This may work but it is inconsistent with the video.

Loved it....but I love cooking ground beef with mushrooms, garlic and onions, so I did. We use a lot of almond milk so I used the unsweetened and was worried but it came out ok. I also followed the others and used half the cream cheese.

I thought I could leave out the cream cheese completely next time, but hubby liked it. Next time, hubby asked for some salt and adding some peas. It made a lot and was filling so we put away 6 individual servings in the freezer for sticking in the microwave for future fast-food meals.

With all the great reviews, I had higher expectations. I made the following variations: Added 2 onions, 4-5 cloves of garlic, fresh mushrooms (instead of canned), and 1 can of cream of mushroom (instead of 2). Despite the addition of onions and garlic, it still tasted bland. I won't make it again, but if I did, I'd reduce the amount of cream cheese to 4 oz as others have mentioned, and I'd use a 10-12 oz package of egg noodles. The 16oz package is far too much. Also, the recipe says it makes 6 servings; I'd say its closer to 8 servings.

Yummy!! Followed others suggestions and cut the soup, cream cheese and sour cream in half. I used thin sliced stir fry beef cut into bite sized pieces and browned with onion. I also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and added some Worcestershire to taste once sauce was combined. A winner and will make again!

Was so excited to find a quick version of beef stroganoff. The one I usually do is done in the slow cooker - with pretty much the same ingredients as this recipe. I found this to be convenient for a week night dinner, however, I found this to be very bland. I tried to revive it somehow, but was afraid it would be worse. I added a lot of salt (I don't like using a lot of salt) and garlic powder. Still, it was lacking in flavour. I will continue with my slow cooker recipe.

This was amazingly simple and had such a good taste.  Simply put, my six-year old loved it.  Definitely will make it again and easy enough to make during the week.  Good flavor - I put in one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of two.  Downside, if there is one, it was rich but sure was good.

Trust me when I say I am as novice as they come in terms of cooking. This site has been gold for me so far, and this recipe didn't disappoint! It was nice and easy, and turned out delicious. I cut down the amount of cream cheese (simply because I misjudged how much I had on hand) but it still came out wonderfully. I did add chopped onions and green peppers but otherwise I stuck to the recipe as printed. And it made great leftovers!

I was not impressed...Granted it did make a large amount but I didn't think it was anything to brag about...I used 1/2 the noodles and added chopped onions & chopped celery and my own seasonings..If I made it again, I'd use all of the cream cheese and increase the milk accordingly...I would also suggest a lb & a half of ground beef as it seemed to have gotten "lost"...

A lot like Hamburger Helper.  I increased the ground beef but still cut the cream and cheese by half.  I also added seasoning, otherwise it would have been bland.

Tried this tonight and it was a hit!  Definitely on the keeper list!  It was very easy and very quick.  I took the advice of another poster and cut the cream cheese in half.  I also added some chopped onions, garlic powder and season salt to the meat.  I accidentally read the directions wrong and put everything in the pan with the meat mixture and then mixed with the pasta...still turned out great!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  We all love this recipe, even friends raved about it.  I usually cut the sour cream, soup and cream cheese in half as others suggested if I'm making one batch.  I do the full recipe as written if I'm making it for a big crowd, I just add a second bag of egg noodles and it's perfect!

This was a pretty good recipe. I followed directions exactly except had one can of Healthy Request soup so used that instead after seeing the sodium content. Split the noodles into two pans at the end...one with ground beef for most of us, and a small pan of soy "ground beef" for my vegetarian daughter. It was a solid dinner, but sort of tasted like a Hamburger Helper from a box kind of thing. May make again if short on ideas.

My family enjoyed this quick, simple recipe.  As numerous previous reviews said, I halved the recipe as we are just 4 (2 adults and 2 kids).  I browned the meat (ground turkey instead of beef) in 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 white onion, then made the whole sauce in that pan instead of mixing with the noodles.  I didn't add sour cream since I didn't have it on hand, but will add it next time.  I used onion & chive cream cheese that added more flavor, and a couple tblsp of worcestershire sauce.  This ended up being a really yummy weeknight dinner that's better than the standard Hamburger Helper.  Thanks for sharing and the other reviews/recommendations!

I remembered this recipe when I wanted to feed a friend going through dental problems and loosing too much weight. Its easy to make, extremely tasty, and it was enticing to my sick friend. I omitted the gravy mix (because I didn't have any) and I did make the sauce just a little thinner and used a little bit of garlic powder. Friend ate it all up and took the rest home for later. That makes me happy. Thank you for sharing.

Yummy.  Halved the soup, sour cream and cream cheese and only used a 12 oz bag of noodles. Added onion and garlic with hamburger, and a little pepper, oregano and parsley.  Skipped the mushrooms.  Kid loved it, and so did we.

I thought it tasted ok, you could taste more sour cream than anything and definitely needed more seasonings. my husbands and kids wouldn't touch it =/

It was okay. The sour cream used in it really just overpowered it. If I make it again I'll modify the recipe to use a little less. Underwhelming but definitely worth the try if you like stroganoff and or looking for something new.

I made this exactly as written, no substitutions or changes. We really, really liked it. I had only a few small things I would do differently next time. The first was that I would probably cut down the cream cheese just a bit. The second would be to add some ground pepper and maybe some garlic powder or something else to kick it up a tad. And the third was that it was a little dry, sticky almost. So after it was made I had to add milk to loosen it back up. Maybe less cream cheese would help with that? Regardless, this as very tasty and reminded me of the stroganoff my Dad used to make growing up. Even my husband who dislikes what he calls "hamburger helper-ish foods" loved it!

As others have stated, this was a great base recipe, all the right ingredients to start with, but you have to finish it with your own bang! I seasoned my ground turkey with garlic, onion, and cayenne pepper. I cut the amount of cream cheese to about 5-6 oz give or take, then followed the recipe as is from there. Once I combined everything, it was still missing something, I added black pepper, a touch of salt, Italian seasoning and what really sent it over the edge, a few splashes of Worchestershire sauce! The family loved it. We like flavor, it wasn't spicy even though I added the pepper, and it still tasted like a delicious stroganoff! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm always looking for "easy" recipes but whip up my own instant mixes (like the brown gravy here). This was sooo simple and my husband says it was the best one I've made yet so this will definitely go in my permanent recipe box!

WOW!  This was great!!  After reading many reviews I added minced garlic and a little Worcestershire sauce, decreased the cream cheese to about 4 oz, used fat free sour cream and because my family isn't fond of mushrooms left those out and subbed a can of cream of celery soup for one of the cream of mushroom.  Fabulous!  Will certainly make again!!

First of all, this recipe makes way too much food for my family of 3.  I would definitely half it.  Secondly, it was way too rich with how much cream cheese and sour cream it called for.  My 3 year old didn't even like it and that's saying a lot.  I had to add a lot of garlic powder and onion powder just to give it flavor.  If I make this again, I would only put half the amount of called for cream cheese and sour cream, and add garlic, and onion to the recipe. I'd also only use about 8 oz of noodles.

Yum!  I did make some changes.  I only used 4 oz of cream cheese, one can of soup and probably 5 oz of sour cream.  I also added one chopped onion and some garlic.  It tasted great and my kids loved it!  I'm giving it 4 stars because as the recipe was written I totally feel it would have been WAY to thick and creamy.  With the changes I made I thought it was a great meal and will most certainly be making it again!

This recipe was so simple and so easy!  I, too, cut the cream cheese down (6 oz as I used a pound and a half of meat), added garlic and onion powder, a little bit of black pepper, used one can of CoM and two packets of brown gravy mix (reduced sodium kind).  I cooked everything for the sauce in the skillet and ladled it over the egg noodles.  My 3 very picky boys devoured it.  Great recipe that you can tweak to your liking :)

I love this recipe! It's a family favorite. There are tons of versions, but I find this one works especially good if using ground turkey instead of ground beef. The gravy gives it the extra flavor it needs with the ground turkey.

I made this for dinner last night...with a few adjustments. I completely omitted the cream cheese,used one package of fresh, sliced mushrooms, replaced the sour cream with one 6 oz container of Fage 0% greek yogurt and only used one can of condensed soup...and put it over some whole wheat egg noodles. I think if the cream cheese had been added it would have been entirely too rich. This was an absolute hit!! I had to restrain myself from licking my plate when I was done....thanks Jessica!

My family enjoyed this dish. I had never made Beef Stroganoff before. I used round steak instead of ground beef and only used 1/2 of the cream cheese. It came out just the righ consistency. It was very easy and quick to make. It's definately a repeat at my house.

I followed some advice from other reviews and sauteed fresh mushrooms and onion separately, added worsheshire sauce; we arand voila! It was super tasty. We are also gluten-free at our house, so we ate this with gluten-free fusili noodles. (made with corn and rice) We didn't have to force my daughter to eat this as usual, she had seconds!!!

I used fresh mushrooms and added some garlic. I didn't have milk so just added a little water so that the sauce wasn't as thick. I also added a whole onion that I cooked with my meat. I didn't see the point in mixing some stuff with the meat and some with the noodles and then mixing it all together so while my noodles finished I just mixed everything in with the meat and let it simmer a little and then tossed it all with my noodles once they were done.

Very simple... however, the taste is just "OK" to me.  You can definitely taste the cream cheese in it.

I prefer mine a little thicker than this makes it, so I made a rou (sp?) and also cut down the amount of milk. I didn't have any mushrooms, sadly, but this recipe turned out really well for stroganoff, even without the actual mushroom pieces. Very good idea, Jessica... it tastes great.

Very good! I did change a few things. We don't like cream of mushroom so I used cream of onion instead. Only used 1 can didn't use the mushrooms either. Used about 1cup of milk, used about 3/4 of the cream cheese and used a 2.75oz pack of dry brown gravy mix. I did have to add a good bit of salt afterwards for extra flavor. Next time I will season my meat mixture a good bit while cooking it. And make sure the cream cheese is softened I actually had to melt mine with the hamburger meat. Mine turned out much thicker than the picture because I didn't use as much of the liquids called for, but this was a VERY good recipe that I WILL make again. My husband and kids even liked it and they are VERY picky eaters.

This was very good but I cut the cream cheese, sour cream and soup in half as well. I also added garlic and onion .  Very good.. I find it would have been way to heavy if I had used the full amount of cream cheese and sour cream..

Great recipe!  Like another reviewed, I added some garlic powder (about 1 tbsp).  Also, I found it a lot easier to mix all the ingredients together, then add it to the pasta.  Where this yields such a HUGE batch, I found this the best way to do it so that the sauce can be frozen.  Tasted great!

I've made this twice now and everyone who's tried it has liked it and wanted the recipe.  What may be surprising about that is I made it with fat free cream cheese and sour cream, and use no-yolk noodles.   It makes a lot - could easily be halved.

This was pretty good.  I did season the beef with salt, pepper, and garlic.  I added closer to a cup of milk, otherwise I thought it would have been too thick for our tastes.  Was very quick to throw together!  Thx!

Just made it last night. We have added this recipe to our rotation. I only use one can of cream of mushroom soup, otherwise it gets too saucy. I love to serve it with green beans. Thanks for the recipe!

It is hard to find something that all three kids like.  I gave this one 5 stars because all my kids (especially the pickiest one) liked this.  It is easy to make and there is enough for left-overs.....that means one less night of cooking for me.  I add garlic and onion when browning the beef.  I think I will sub out a can of Cream of Mushroom for Golden Mushroom next time just to try something different.

I thought the recipe was really good. I added onions and fresh mushrooms to mine.  I also made the sauce with one can of cream of mushroom and one can of golden mushroom; the idea was from another stroganoff recipe on the site.  I like the color it produces and I think it gives more flavor. Oh, I also forgot to add the milk, but didn't notice until after I was done eating.

Definitely should have read the other reviews first, way too much cream cheese and sour cream. But the taste was still delightful, if you cut those two ingredients in half it would probably be the best non-restaurant stroganoff I've ever had.

I love this recipe; my whole family will eat it without complaining!  That makes it magic right there, but I also like that it is quick & simple, doesn't dirty a kitchen-full of dishes, and it uses things that I almost always have on hand-plus it tastes great. I frequently add things to the recipe, depending on what I have around. My favorite is to add peas, and/or corn.  Recently, I served it over refrigerator biscuits instead of pasta, & it was just as great. I have even subbed out the ground beef for sliced deli roast beef, and it was wonderful =] Thank you for this recipe!

This is a good basic recipe. I used a packet of dry onion soup mix instead of beef gravy because that's what I had. I omitted the cream cheese because I didn't have any and only used 1/2 cup of sour cream. I can't imagine how rich it would have been with them! really quick.

I really didn't like this recipe.  I followed the other reviews and didn't put so much cream cheese and sour cream.. but it was still too much.  If I tried this recipe again I would follow other suggestions and cook the ground beef in onion and garlic and cut the cream cheese and sour cream in HALF..

I just made this Stroganoff for my husband, son and I, and I was really disappointed. With all the sour cream and cream cheese, it was just too heavy. The taste was a bit off, too. Maybe it was the particular type of gravy mix I bought... My husband did seem to think it was so bad, and it was edible, but I won't be making this again.

It was quite rich and creamy, but needed some flavor. Garlic salt is the perfect addition. Also produces a little more than I was prepared for... overall, it's a quick but tasty meal.

I cut down all the dairy products by half but still found the recipe to be too rich.  I added a diced red pepper and some garlic.  It has almost a velveeta consistency.

I made this recipe for my family not to long ago. It was really good but kind of dry. I changed a couple of things I use fresh mushrooms and mix all the ingredients minus the noodles to make a sauce. Then poured it over the noodles. It gave it that sauciness it needed. Now it is one of our favorites thanks for the recipe.

This is super quick and easy recipe! We loved it. I made this ahead of time for my family and instead of mixing the noodles with soup sauce, I mixed the soup mix right into the hambuger. My husband cooked the noodles when he got home and then mixed everything together. It was a big hit. Next time as others suggested, I will cut the cream cheese in half.

This was very good.  I didn't have mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup, so I had to alter the recipe.  I think it would be too rich with the soup though, so I probably will never add it.  When I browned the meat, I mixed in a package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  I put the gravy mix in with the noodles and a cup of milk, instead of soup.  It turned out really good! It wasn't as creamy when I reheated it, but I bet if I added a little milk when I reheat, it would be.

I should've listened to what previous posters said, when to use 4 oz. cream cheese instead of 8.  It just makes it extremely rich, its still very good, but very rich tasting..

Flavorful and filling, my family voted to keep this in rotation!  I made it exactly as written without changes to anything.  It makes a lot, so I was able to freeze the left over’s for another full meal.  One word – YUM!

Very tasty the first day and the second!!  My husband liked it as well.  It turned out a little dry though, I tend to like my stroganoff a little creamier.  Next time I'll add a bit more soup and sour cream to see if it creates more sauce.

Getting a three because it was edible and my hubby liked it. There was little actual flavor, and the noodles had a very weird texture because of the sour cream. Next time I'll save the beef for better purposes instead of making this. Easy? Yes. Did it make me sick later? Also yes.

I made half the amount of sauce as recommended. It was very rich. I didn't care for the cream cheese in this. It was very easy but I probably won't make this one again. This wasn't very flavorful.

very good...next time i will cut the cream cheese to half, as others suggested. It's very rich! I also used reduced fat cream cheese, sour cream, soup, and skim milk and grd. turkey to cut some fat & calories! still great.

turned out really good! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and also used a mushroom soup mix instead. My husband, and I loved it.

Delicious. I used Campbell's Healthy Request condensed cream of mushroom soup, fat free sour cream, 1% milk, low-fat cream cheese,and lean ground beef.  I don't think the flavor suffered at all by using healthier options. My 16 month old son sucked the sauce right off of the noodles he loved it and so did my 2 year but my 4 year old is too picky.  I will make this again.

This was so good! I even used 1/2 fat free and 1/2 light for both the sour cream and cream cheese and 97% fat free for the cream of mushroom and it turned out delicious!

I made the recipe exactly and it was good. Both my children (14 and 5) really liked it.  It did make quite a lot though, more like 8 servings.  That was ok with me since my husband loves leftovers for lunch.  I did think it was a bit thick and bland, so next time I will change it up a bit.  I'll omit the cream cheese, use fresh mushrooms and sauté them with onions and garlic while browning the beef.  I plan to try beef consommé rather than the gravy mix and I'll use the Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup as well.  Although this would never replace my traditional beef stroganoff recipe, this was a great weeknight dinner.  Overall this was a great easy base recipe for any cook to tweak or use as written.

This was fun. My 7th grade son searched & picked it out himself. Plus cooked (most of) it. He thought it was too cream cheesy. Left out the mushrooms. Mom added a big mound of garlic & more milk - it's too thick. Thanks for an easy, kid friendly recipe.

Good quick and filling.  Pretty much followed recipe with recommended cream cheese change.  I have to agree with other posters its not wet enough the stroganoff sauce should be creamy not as thick as this was.  I'd say it needs about another 1 c of liquid which if you think about the gravy mix there was no liquid called for in the meat mixture once I added in this case water the consistency was right there.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not good at all. With all that cream cheese and sour cream....to much. My husband who usually goes for seconds decided to eat cold pizza instead. I follow the directions...dont know what everyone is raving about. Also the size of the recipe is very large. I so much that no one want to eat.

This was very good, but pretty rich.  I am not sure I would use all the cream cheese next time.  I left out the mushrooms because my husband dosn't care for them, but other was made as written.

My family just loved this meal! I used to buy Hamburger Helper years ago before I started being more health conscience and it is one thing that my family has really missed. All of my picky eaters cleaned thier plates and asked for seconds. I did sub fresh sliced mushrooms for the canned and I sauteed them with the ground beef. I also used the whole brick of cream cheese and we loved it that way. I served with steamed veggies and it made a great weeknight meal with 2 pots and little effort that will definitely be added to our regular round of recipes!

This was really yummy, and my husband fell in love with this dish! He ate most of it himself.. lol  It does make up a lot, and is very simple to make.. Like others tho I would suggest using onion and garlic while browning the hamburger.. But either way I find it delish!

Let's say 3-and-a-half stars. While this recipe is certainly inexpensive, simple, fast and filling (four stars for those qualities) it would be nearly flavourless if made as written. As other reviewers suggested, I added garlic, onion, and worcestershire to the ground beef (and halved the cream cheese) and it still remained blah. Better reheated the next day, it's true. But I think I'll stick with "beef strip" stroganoff, using my own spices and broth, instead of processed gravy mix and soup.... On the flip side, I only happened upon this because my brother was going to make Hamburger Helper, and I couldn't stand the thought of him eating sodium and additives and considering it a proper meal! So I foisted this recipe on him and he totally loved it ... Different strokes!

I often make stroganoff the traditional way, but tried this hamburger version for a busy night.  Everyone thought it was pretty good, even my husband who normally doesn't like recipes with condensed soups!  I didn't use the gravy mix, but did add about 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce and think that adds a delicious, authentic flavor! Keep some already browned ground beef on hand for a 15 minute meal!

Was looking for a simple recipe for the ground beef I already had browned and drained when I ran across this recipe. I had most of the ingredients on hand with the exception of the brown gravy. Instead I used a can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom along with a can of Campbell's cream of mushroom. I also spiced it up a little a with garlic, onion & Worcestershire sauce and a little "Kitchen Bouquet" to give it a brown gravy appearance. I mixed all the ingredients together and served over egg noodles (eggless for us since my boys are allergic to eggs). Made a good meal for 4 and took less than a hour to prepare. I gave this recipe 4 stars because I had to add ingredients, but it is a great basic recipe! Thumbs Up from my family! Will be a "do over" in my house.

Ok I am giving this one star because I made it as the directions were and we did not like it at all and had to add several things to it to make it taste good.Before we added things it was terribly bland. So this is what we did.

Make it according to directions then add:

1 pkg dry onion soup mix
3 beef bouillion cubes
garlic powder
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce.

After we did this it tastes pretty good.

Per previous reviews, we used a little less cream cheese and sour cream.  We also just mixed everything together at the end.  Makes a TON!  Hopefully it defrosts and heats well...

My husband raved over this dish! This was so very creamy and such an easy recipe. I only had 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, so I used a can of beef consomme for the other. This was actually better after I let it stand for several minutes so the pasta could absorb some of the sauce. I did not use the whole pkg of pasta, I used a little more than half because there were only 3 of us. I was surprised at how good this was for how easy and fast it was. This was wonderful comfort food. Thanks Jessica for sharing this!!! We all LOVED this dish.

This was quite good, I added about a cup of frozen peas to the boiling pasta, and turned off the pasta early, letting it sit in the hot water til the sauce was ready. I also mixed all the ingredients into the sauce and served on top of the pasta instead of mixing some with the pasta first. Would be great to double and freeze half the sauce for a later date.

The cream cheese was overpowering! I omitted the mushrooms as we are not huge mushroom fans but the crm-o-mush was still too strong of a taste! It made me FEEL like I was trying to eat on a budget.

This is a great, one pot meal.  My family really enjoyed this and the leftovers were even better.  Add a salad and dinner rolls to complete.  Don't waste your money on boxed dinners, make this instead!

This was a good recipe.  It reminds me of Hamburger Helper.  It was very rich, and very heavy.  Next time I make this I will use less cream cheese and more milk.  Thank you for the recipe

I will be making this simple hamburger stroganoff again. It was a hit at dinner and the pasta really filled everyone up. I thought the recipe was easy and it took no time at all before we were at the table enjoying it.

This recipe was fantastic.  I do not cook often but this was easy & delicious.  It was one of the most flavorful stroganoff dishes I've had.  Definitely making it again.

This was YUMMY!  I used all ingredients that the recipe called for.  I mixed everything together but the egg noodles.  We just served noodles with the sauce on top.

I gave this meal 5 stars because it turned out exactly as described.  A very quick and tasty meal.  I did add fresh mushrooms and chopped onions to the meat as I browned it and I cut the soup back to one can.  I found I had plenty of creamy sauce.  Thanks for a great family meal!

I halved the soup, sour cream and cream cheese and it came out creamy and tasty. Hubby wasn't impressed, but I liked it.

My first time making stroganoff, got experimental & threw some potatoes chunks & bacon in there and loved it!  Was very pleased how quick & easy this one comes together.  Also my first time trying mushrooms in a jar and it was great!  Thanks Jessica!

I have to say we didn't care for this at all, yes, it was easy and quick but all I could taste was the cream cheese and gravy mix. I even used two pounds of beef for a double batch for my large family and I hate to think what it would have tasted like, Not doubling it and using all the cream cheese called for in the six serving recipe. I'll stick with my old recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  As with everyones taste being different I did tweak it a bit to fit our taste.  But, the basic recipe was very good.  Would make again.

Took others advice-added pepper and onions. Replaced gravy mix with 2Tbsp Worctshire. used 1 can soup for less sodium and less cream cheese.
I used fresh mushrooms. Also, Don't mix with noodles, just spoon overtop for less mushiness!
Wonderful!!!!

Delicious! Per other suggestions, I decreased the amount of cream cheese & sour cream to 1/2 of what was called for, & used 1&1/2 cans of the mushroom soup.  In a lot of recipes involving pasta, I like to reduce the amount called for, but I ended up going back and making all 16oz of pasta because there's a lot of sauce.  **I would highly recommend adding black pepper, garlic powder (about 1&1/2 tsp, depending on taste), & onion, plus a dash or two of parsley & oregano for a more flavorful aftertaste, & a bit of color. This is plenty for 2 people to have 2-3 meals.

I had to make a couple of changes becase I didn't have everything on hand. I used 1-1/2 lbs. hamb, instead of dry gravy I used a jar of Heinz zesty garlic beef gravy, no milk, no sour cream and only 1 can of cream of mush soup. I did use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and my family loved this recipe and they thought it was only cr. of mush soup and gravy. I made egg noodles with it but my husband wanted mashed potatoes so I ended up making both.
Thank you so much for this wonderful dish. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

Can you say Yummy? I was impressed with this recipe because it was easy, quick and delicious. I ommitted the mushroom slices by popular demand, but it was awesome. I salted and peppered a lot. I also used a little more hamburger than it called for. This is a big hit. I will be making this one again and again.

This recipe was really easy and tastes just like a stroganoff.
I have 3 small picky eaters and a meat loving hubby and this recipe pleased all!
It makes a ton and reheats well.
It is in our family recipe file for sure.

The recipe came out pretty well. I  only added one can of soup, and next time I would add less cream cheese.  It could use a little seasoning as well.  But overall pretty good and very easy to make.

Easy!!!  My husband and my boys loved it. It made enough for leftovers for two more nights ( blessing and a curse). I used farfalle noodles instead of egg noodles and added garlic salt to taste. The only thing I I’ll do differently next time is cook the mushrooms separately in the hamburger pan. They were a little under done because I didn’t want to overcook the hamburger.  Quick and easy last minute dinner...tastes delicious too!!

This was good and easy. Only used half the cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup. Added chopped onion and minced garlic, 3TB Worcestershire, and 1ts Dijon mustard. Salt and pepper to taste. More milk if too thick. Will make again!

After reading a few of the other reviews I went ahead and did my own thing. I had just under a lb of ground beef and I found in my freezer about a 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage so I defrosted that and added to the ground beef. Drained that. Added a small yellow onion, chopped and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Added some Worcestershire, maybe 2 tbsps. Salt & ground pepper. Let that simmer for about 10 min. Then added one can of beef broth and one can of cream of mushroom soup. Then a small can of drained mushroom pieces. (should've added anther can). Let that cook for about 15-20 min. Just before serving, I added about 1/2 sour cream and blended it into the meat mixture. Poured over wide egg noodles.

Absolutely amazing.  Made it for a family when they needed some help when they got incredibly busy with sick family members.  I tried a bit before sending it over and loved it, and they also loved it!

Family loved it! Can’t wait for me to make it again. I had 2lbs. of hamburger dethawing before I decided what to make so I just used all of it in the recipe and it still turned out great.

Really easy and tasty! I did not add as much cream cheese, because we didn’t have enough on hand. I had to estimate the brown gravy mix, as we have a huge jar of that powder, so I just made  two cups of that gravy pretty rich (since I doubled the recipe). 

Just needs a bit of salt, but left that people to add to their own portions. We served it  with mixed veggies on the side, cinnamon apple sauce and some dinner rolls. Will make this again, surely!

This was a very easy dish to prepare and was quite tasty.  I followed the suggestions I read in a few of the other reviews and cooked the ground beef with some onion and garlic, and I only used half of the block of cream cheese and one can on cream of mushroom soup.  The consistency was good, without being too creamy.

Good with the following modifications: added sauted mushrooms and onions, used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and sour cream,  added about 8 ounces or so of beef broth, added salt, pepper and garlic powder.

I didn't have ground beef so I sliced up some beef tips. I also read reviews and added (as one writer suggested) some Worcesteshire sauce. It came out great! Also, I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup. The sauce was perfect.

This stroganoff was delicious! I made it for my parents and they both got second helpings. I will definitely make this again!
Changes: I cut the cream cheese in half to 4 oz like other reviews suggested, and I mixed in some garlic while cooking the hamburger.

I followed the recipe and found it wanting. I would definitely halve the amount of cream of mushroom soup, in this recipe. The amount that this recipe calls for, sort of drowns out the “stroganoff” flavor. My children seemed to like it well enough, but if I make it again, I’ll need to make some adjustments. But that’s a big “if”. Sorry. I love stroganoff and am not a real fan of this recipe. It’s ok.

I haven't made this YET, but I most definitely WILL! It sounds like an easier, quicker, & ALMOST complete version of my favorite dish!
BUT... a MAJOR component of EVERY good Stroganoff recipe I've ever seen, made or eaten includes wine, usually SHERRY! It serves as a counterbalance to cut the excessive richness & thickness I've read so many complaints about here. 
PLUS... it will make it taste like Stroganoff is supposed to!
I'll check back after I make it... with SHERRY!!!

I liked it very much.  I added Southwestern Corn to it.  Added mozzarella cheese to the top and baked for 30 minutes.  Delish!

Based on other reviews, halved the cream cheese and the soup. Sauteed an onion and fresh mushrooms (instead of canned), then removed from pan before browning meat. Meant to add garlic to the onion, will have to add next time. Used ground venison because that’s what I had on hand. Added several dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat. I also built the whole mixture separate from the egg noodles using a canful of milk and served it over the egg noodles. Served with steamed peas. Husband and I both liked, will make again.

Tasty and really easy. However mine was very saucy. Next time I’ll cut the cream cheese, milk, sour cream, and gravy mix in half. It was too much sauce for the ground beef and mushrooms

I tweaked this a little bit but its a good base to start with! I added minced garlic and chopped onions while browning the hamburger.  I used a 12 oz. package of egg noodles, 1/2 of the cream cheese and sour cream called for and only 1 can of soup. Served it with homemade bread and dinner was a success!

My boyfriend and children LOVED it, which is the only reason for the good review. Personally, I found it way too creamy. If you're not into really creamy dinners I would recommend 1 can of soup and half the sour cream. Taste was great otherwise.

I sauteed half of a medium onion (minced) before browning the burger, then a couple teaspoons of minced garlic to up the flavor profile.
Not low calorie, but great comfort food for a cold night.

Simple and good recipe. I didn’t have everything on hand so instead of gravy, I used a packet of onion soup mix, added a dash of worchestire and some (not a lot but I didn’t measure) ranch dressing mix. I also used cream and milk and cavatappi pasta since I didn’t have egg noodles. I mixed everything together in a skillet and then mixed into the pasta. My husband loved the flavor and also the pasta swap. Very hearty for a cold winter night!

Loved this for a college budget, maybe next time I make this though I'd use a little less cream cheese. Other than that everything blended together pretty well and filled everyone up!

It is simple but bland. I did add onion, salt & pepper but it still was to thick, even add 3/4 cup of milk didn't help.

AMAZING! I did make a few minor adjustments. I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I substituted with a cup of heavy whipping cream and added a cup of frozen peas just for fun. either way I think if I would have stuck with the original recipe it still would've been just as great!

This stroganoff was fantastic!
I made some slight modifications....
* I added 1/3  chopped onion to the browning ground beef.
* I used 8-10 sliced fresh mushrooms (Instead of using the canned mushrooms).  When the ground beef was almost browned I added them to the meat & onions, covering the skillet until mushrooms were almost done.
* I used an 8 oz. bag of noodles (not 16 oz.) and it was the perfect amount.
* Add fresh ground salt and ground pepper to taste.

I used onion powder in lieu of onion and 1t of Better Than Bouillon for the dry gravy.  Sometimes I mix all ingredients, but for the pasta, in one pan, then serve over steaming hot noodles.

The only thing I modified was added garlic powder and onion powder because we love those flavors in just about everything!  This was so creamy and had a nice depth of beef flavor from the gravy packet. You would have thought I spent hours in the kitchen on it! Thanks as always for another delicious ?? recipe. I use your site above and beyond all the others...seriously. It always ends up with what our family's taste buds love!!! ????????????

Made exactly as the recipe stated except I used cubed beef that I cooked in the pressure cooker with onion soup mix for 30 minutes. My 5 year old grandson had two servings as did everyone else. My daughter asked for the leftovers for lunch the next day. Definitely a keeper and THANK YIOU for the recipe!

Added 1/2 onion, 1 clove garlic - minced, and roughly chopped 8 oz fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) and addedtomeet when browning. Only used 1/2 cream cheese (and subbed the 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese). Only needed about 80% of the noodles. Topped with parmesan and served with peas. Yum!

Awesome recipe. One of my most popular dishes!!! If need lactose free, for sour cream buy grass fed and buy unpasteurized milk from your local dairy farm!

It is delicious! I misread the directions and mixed all the ingredients with the pasta instead of the meat but it all goes together anyway so it still turned out good. It might have just been harder to mix. It does make a lot but that means leftovers for my husband and I. We will definitely be having this again.

I detest powdered gravy and canned mushrooms so I cooked the hamburg with onions and fresh mushrooms, and added a splash of red wine, sherry and organic better then bullion.  I also reduced the cream cheese to slightly more then a half what the recipe called for and it came out really good.

Great recipe.   I didn't make it as written because I didn't have everything.  I ended up with an amazing dinner.   I used 2lbs of burger 1can of cream of mush and left out the can of mushrooms.  It needed extra fluid so I added some beef broth and milk.  Very easy recipe to work with.

It’s a good base but needed to be heavily seasoned. I diced up an onion and minced fresh garlic and cooked that then added 2 pounds ground beef. Seasoned it up with onion powder, pepper, seasoned salt, eyeballed red wine. Used one can of cream of mushroom soup, one brick of cream cheese and a couple scoops of sour cream. Used 2 4 oz cans of mushrooms and used our Deville seasoning to put it over the top. Served over egg noodles, rice or toast! Ty for the recipe!

It came out alright, but I definitely added spices to the meat so that the taste could rise from under the weight of all of the dairy.

It was definitely too "cream"y, so if I were to make it again, I would follow the lead of a different reviewer and cut the cream cheese, sour cream, and soup in half.

This stroganoff is wonderful. It is very easy to make. It makes a good amount. And it tastes so good. 
Wouldn't it be nice if there were a button that would take you to a parallel site where all ingredients and time to cook would be adjusted for overall portions for single people. Already I have had four portions and I have not made a dent in the container.
Again. This Stroganoff is wonderful!

This is very good recipe and simple to make; however you have to season it, otherwise there is no flavor. I added salt & pepper, onion, garlic and parsley. I also used ground turkey and fresh mushrooms. It was tasty.

Flavor was good, but don't think I am a fan of the cream cheese added. Previously I had only made stroganoff with sour cream. It was simply too thick and didn't have enough of a 'gravy' consistency for me. Maybe halfing the amount would help. The only change I made was adding almost 3 times the amount of milk in the end to make it not so thick, and it didn't seem to help.

Like some others,  I cut the cream cheese in half and only used 1 and 1/2  cans of cream of mushroom soup. Also added 1 yellow onion minced and cooked it with the hamburger. Instead of adding the soup mixture to the noodles I added it to the hamburger and ladled it over the plated noodles.  My wife is a picky eater and LOVED it. It was actually better the next day when we had leftovers for lunch.  This was a quick and easy meal to make and certainly one I will make again

I have never before cooked something that all of us didn’t like. My poor 2.5 yr old was trying not to gag while eating it and my hubby had one bite and was done. I wasn’t a fan either. We all like stroganoff, but not this one. I’m glad others like it, but not for us.

Would be better with less cream cheese and less sour cream but otherwise good.

I made a few changes like other reviewers:  fresh mushrooms, worchestershire sauce, garlic and fresh onion in the ground beef.  i used two lbs ground beef and doubled everything expect the cream cheese.  We thought it was great.  Super easy and took no time at all to whip up.

The recipe sounded good as is but I didn’t want to use the cream cheese. Instead of the cream cheese and milk I substituted half and half. The recipe turned out creamy and delicious! My husband loved it and I will make again! PS I added garlic and onions to the cooking meat. Also I had a mushroom gravy packet to use.

This was delicious!  Since this was my first time making it, I pretty much stuck to the recipe. But I did include some chopped onion, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, and some Nature's Seasons seasoning blend.  Next time I think I will cut back on the cream cheese as quite a few others have commented doing. And I think just a 12-oz bag of egg noodles would have been plenty. 
My husband and son agree that this is a definite repeat!

5 stars with tweaks (haters gonna hate....). Definitely simple. No need to make one mixture to add to noodles - just make it all in one pot, pasta separate.  I added Worcestershire sauce (3 tsp), fresh chopped onion and garlic, fresh mushrooms, and slivers of red bell pepper. Kept the cream cheese, gravy, milk, etc. the same.  Taste at the end to see if you want more salt.  Was nice to have a dinner that was less than 45 min to make, but still tasted really good.

I used the recipe as a guideline.  I put all the ingredients in, but in different amounts, as I used what I had in the refrigerator.  It was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this for dinner last night.. sort of. This recipe sounded a little bland and blah, so I made a few changes.  I cut everything but the milk in half. Instead of ground beef, I used antelope round tip. I sautéed fresh mushrooms instead, adding onion, garlic & ground black pepper. After combining everything, I added another 1/2 cup(ish) milk, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. After doctoring it up some.. Super easy to make, really quick & pretty darn delicious.

Quick, easy, and good.  Added some garlic and onions to the meat and browned all together with fresh mushrooms.  Used 1/2 of the cream cheese as suggested by others.  Made the sauce all in one pan and warmed through, adding sour cream and some pepper at the end.  Added noodles and loosed sauce a bit with some of the pasta water.  The cream cheese was a nice touch.  Added some seasoning salt and a couple of shakes of worcestershire and it  really boosted the flavor and changed this dish from 4 stars to 5.  Tastes great!

After much procrastination, I found the perfect day to make this recipe....a cold & rainy one!! Since I do not like using canned mushrooms...ever...I took some Cremini mushrooms, removed the stems, thinly sliced the tops then sautéed them in butter for about 8 minutes. Intense flavour that was noticed indeed. I also saved 1 cup of the egg noodle cooking water to thin out the rich texture of the sauce. I finished the dish with some cracked, black pepper. Will definitely make again for a large crowd.

This is the second time i have made this dish and it is a crowd-pleaser at my house. Next time around, i may add one half teaspoon of tomato paste, 1 clove of crushed garlic, and a tablespoon of dry sherry. I will also substitute 1 pound of fresh mushrooms in lieu of the canned, halve the cream cheese, and use beef consomme to replace the milk. I feel that this will give a more traditional taste to the dish. Great as it is the original recipe tastes like the stoganoff  boxed dinner you add chop meat to.

I added a chopped medium onion, minced garlic and onion powder to the cooking hamburger meat.  I only used half of the cream cheese and instead added about 3/4 cup of milk instead of only 1/2 cup to make it less thick. I also used the small 8oz bag of swirl egg noodles, that's why I already had. With all of this mixed together, it all turned out great!! Very quick and easy recipe. Will make it again.

I thought it was great!  The only thing I'd change next time is use 1.5 lbs of ground beef.  I just like more meat in it, personal preference.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  However,  it was much better as left overs reheated. Had a funny taste right out of the pan.

This recipe is amazing! It's the ultimate comfort food and incredibly easy to make. I did make a couple changes but overall I followed the recipe as written.  I used a big package of stirfry strips beef though and I added fresh onions, garlic cloves (diced), fresh mushrooms and only half of a brick of cream cheese. I also used paprika in the recipe. It was a hit. My husband even took the leftovers in his lunch.  Everyone had seconds including me! I will definitely make this again. It's by far one of the most quick, easy and delicious recipes to make.  Thanks for this one, it ROCKS!!

I've made this multiple times now and my husband and I love it.  I made a few changes.  I don't like mushrooms so I didn't add the can of mushrooms and I also used half of the sour cream it called for.  There's also WAY too many noodles.  I've used a 12 oz bag and it's still way too much so I'm going to try either less noodles or double the meat.  This makes a lot of food for 2 people so we have plenty of left overs.  It's still very good though.

Family loved it.  Followed the recipe except for the last step and after I combined it but it in the fridge for later.  When we were ready to eat cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes.  Started cooking from a cold oven since my glass dish had been in the fridge.

Tried to make it exactly like the recipe but only used 4 oz of cream cheese.  It makes A LOT!  It was okay, but didn't blow me away.  Probably won't make it again and will look for something else similar to try.

This was fantastic! I had to modify a bit. I had bought a package of brown gravy mix, but could not find it anywhere, so I used Better Than Bullion Beef base and it was fantastic!  I think I will sautéed the burger with garlic and onions next time and perhaps throw in some paprika for a layer of taste.  But this was very easy and we will def. have it again.

Very easy to make and surprisingly good.  I didn't use all the ingredients though... it would've been too much.  I added fresh mushrooms to the hamburger while sauteing, along with about 1/4 of an onion.  I added about half the cream cheese, only 1 can of soup, no milk, and about half a cup of sour cream.   I used some seasoned salt and ground pepper.  That's all it needed really. My gf and I enjoyed it.

I thought this was excellent and very easy to prepare!  I did substitute some cream of celery and cream of onion for the mushroom soup since we don't care for the taste of it.  Leaving the actual mushrooms out was also essential but it was delightful without them.  One note- this burns very easily.  Be sure to watch carefully after you've added the cream cheese.  Great recipe!

It was a winner at our home.  I used half cream cheese just because that was all I had available and it was still wonderful.  Going to add in peas next time for some texture an color.  Sent to my daughter and she too enjoyed recipe. I will definitely make again.

I made this the other night and it was very god, and a lot easier to make than the recipe I use to make. Instead of gravy mix I used Lipton Beef dried soup mix and it was wonderful. It makes a lot for one person, and now I won't have to cook again until next week

To start with, I did cut the cream cheese  in half and I didn't have the brown gravy mix. This was still surprisingly very good. The wife and I, mostly me, ate the whole dish for dinner.
I will definitely make it again and will try it with the gravy but either way this was good without it.

I made this tonight. The only change I made was I sprinkled some onion and garlic powder on the beef when I browned it. I must say this was delicious. My wife and I both agreed absolutely delicious. I've made a bunch of stroganoff recipes and they never turned out this good. Only thing is 16 oz of noodles is way too much I only wound up needing about 3/4 of the noodles so just cook them all and add as necessary.  Thank you so much Jessica, this one is in my box permanently

I made this it was great. Instead of can mushroom I used freshmushroom I did however sauté  them before.   It was  great.  I also  made with diced steak it I found on sale and brought a lot of .  It work out really  good . The diced steak did not take that much longer to cook.  I think it made the recipe even better.

If you have unexpected company drop in,grab a pkg of hamburger and throw it in the microwave and thaw it out then fry with some diced onions. It's so simple but soooo yummy.Also I DIDN'T use brown gravy mix.

Good. Made w/o mushrooms using 1.5lb beef, gravy mix, mushroom soup mix, 6oz Neufchatel, ½ tsp garlic, ½ tsp pepper, 1 c milk, ½ c leftover gravy, bit of liquid from canned beans in one pan, adding sour cream at end and serving over pasta w/ green beans. Rich and made a lot (filled larger skillet). Think one can of soup would be plenty (and better than mix, but I was out). Will make again using soup and cutting sour cream and maybe 4oz cheese. Not sure garlic was needed, might try Worcestershire sauce someone else added. Family liked, could have fed 8. Fresh mushrooms would be good if I didn't have my picky eaters...

This recipe was more flavorful than I thought it would be.  I added a little onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, salt & pepper to the beef as it was browning. I used fresh baby bella mushrooms, sauteed in a little butter, instead of canned mushrooms. Husband and kids loved it and went back for seconds!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I guess I am more a traditionalist where stroganoff is concerned because I like my sauce a little tart.  This was a very creamy sauce but it didn't have any discernible  flavor.  This was also my first time trying hamburger in stroganoff  instead of beef.  I thought I would try this to save a little money but ended up making up for the price difference in the meat by buying all the cream cheese, sour cream, and soup.  It was a fast, easy recipe to make, my four year old loved it.  I just wasn't for me or my husband.

I added a little chopped onion with the hamburger, did use 2 lbs. ground chuck, and just before browned completly
 added 2 cloves garlic.
This made a huge casserole which we all loved!!!  Did use reduce fat sour cream and also cream cheese.
Was just delicious.
Husband said it was worth the effort.
Thanks for this great recipe.

We left out the cream cheese to make it less expensive to make. I also added fresh sliced onion with the hamburger, and had a handful of frozen mixed veg I threw in near the end. It was great, and made enough to feed 6-8 if you have another side dish. Will add to my repertoire.

I finally did make this recipe, and was really good. I do have another recipe for this, that is a smaller version, but basically the same ingredients, except the other one is with beef cutlets, and it is a little better than this one. That is why I gave it 4 stars.

This was an easy quick dinner that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed! The only change I made was only using ONE can of mushroom soup. If I tried it again I would probably add garlic or some other seasoning just to change it up but overall very tasty!

I LOVED this recipe and my only tweaks were I sautéed the mushrooms in butter and garlic first and set them aside.  I also used Lipton's Beefy Onion  dry soup mix and instead of a 16 oz pkg of egg noodles I used a 12 oz pkg of medium egg noodles which was more then enough.  I added more milk as I went along just because it seemed to dry out a little bit.  Lastly, we had corn as a side dish so I added it to the leftovers and would totally add corn next time to it but I'm a huge corn lover!!  Enjoy!~

Yes, I would make this again.  Took notes from previous reviews.  Definitely added more seasoning, garlic and onion powder.  Half of the cream cheese, one can of soup and no milk.  Easy, fast and delicious.  Enjoy., we all did.

As another reviewed mentioned, it's a good base. I also cooked chopped onion in with the ground beef with salt, pepper, and a good amount of garlic powder. I wanted a large batch for leftovers, so I used the rest of the recipe as written. It still needs a little something to boost the taste, but I haven't determined what that is yet.

As I did not have gravy mix, I used bouillon, cornstarch and water and it passed muster, even with that substitution.  Easy to make, minimum cleanup and tasty when all is said and done.  Perfect weekday meal when served with a green salad.

It was very good, relatively easy to make, 
I did add too much milk, but that kept the leftovers most.
I didn't add salt, pepper or spicing, it was good as is, then on the second helping added some sea salt
Perfection!
Looking forward to the leftovers tonight. Needs salt to taste, thinking of adding some hit spice for variety.

Thank you

I followed the directions exactly. I did add salt, pepper and garlic salt. This dish went over very well. My husband will not eat hamburger helper stroganoff, he can't stand it. However he ate two big helpings of this stroganoff. It's very creamy and delicious.

I followed the directions faithfully, with the exception of no canned mushrooms (I don't have any in stock), and the addition of minced onion and salt and pepper on the beef.  It was excellent.  I read other posters saying it was too rich and, although it was rich,  it was a perfect stroganoff.  We both agreed it could have been a tad thinner, but I will just add milk to take care of that.  It has now become an integral part of our list of favorite meals.

This is heavy on the calorie count, but just the right thing when you need comfort food.  I would have added peas or broccoli and another can of mushrooms, but overall a yummy dish.

Although this was easy to make, as indicated, it was too bland to suit me.  I even spiced it up based on the other reviews -- added some onion and garlic, and chopped parsley when serving -- but I think the cream cheese was over the top.  Too much creaminess, needed to be backed down a notch.  I like the ease of preparation, but I need to tweak this a bit, and unfortunately it will not be a "repeater" with my dear hubby.

I have made this several times and it is really good (added 1/2 c onions, 1/2 t. fresh garlic, one can of soup, and only 1 T cream cheese, rest the same as recipe).  I also made it with ground chicken and turkey but used Cream of Chicken Mushroom soup and a pack of chicken gravy mix instead of the reg. mushroom soup and beef gravy, mushrooms, etc. changing as I did the beef version.  Really good and easily adapted.

Essentially, a very good recipe and easy to make but  fresh mushrooms really make the dish so much better. I also added garlic and onion to the meat plus a few tablespoons of sherry cooking wine to the gravy.  Real comfort food .

Would make over in a heart beat but would cut down on size. Recipe said 6 servings but makes enough for 12 and I only used 12 Oz. of noodles. Could use more spice but that's a personal taste thing.

I am not a big mushroom fan, so I didn't put the can of mushrooms in.  I added about 1/2 a cup of water from the noodles, so it wouldn't be so dry.  It was very very good and it was quick.  I will be making it again, but will cut the recipe in half.

This is similar to a recipe in one of my Mom's old cook books.  Hers uses Cream of chicken soup, onion and garlic, and eliminates the gravy mix and Cream cheese, which I don't think are necessary.  I prefer hers.  A generous amount of Parsley flakes adds color and flavor.

I have been making a version of this for years and the whole family loves it.  My boys always ask for "homemade hamburger helper" which is how they refer to it.  Instead of brown gravy mix I use an envelope of dry onion soup mix which adds a bit of extra flavor.

It's not often I give a recipe 5 stars but everyone in my family loved it, it was easy to prepare, and you can give it your own touch. I cooked my ground beef with onion and garlic. and fresh mushrooms. Yes, I did add things based on our family's preference, but the basic recipe is the same.  Like many reviewers, I cut the sour cream, cream cheese, and soup in half. I added a dash of Worcestershire. I then added milk until it was the consistency I wanted.  I only used 1/2 bag of egg noodles and we thought it was just right.

I give it a 5 because it was a great base to start with.  And it seemed pretty simple so I was encouraged to try it when I didn't have a ton of time to fix dinner.  I did read reviews before and made changes to my tastes.  While cooking the 16 oz bag of egg noodles, I browned 1.5 lbs hamburger, small minced onion and
 2 cloves minced garlic all together in deep pan and drained.  Then added to pan 1 T Better than Beef Bouillon instead of the gravy packet, 1/2 c. water because I left the mushrooms out. 4 oz. cream cheese, 1 t seasoned salt, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 8 oz sour cream,  1 c. milk to  thin a little more, 1/4 c. cooking sherry because I didn't have red wine, 1 small bag baby frozen green peas (I needed a complete meal to serve to my aging parents in their 90's) Add additional salt and pepper to taste.  This makes a large portion, but it was all gone in a few days.  I'll make it again and invite guest over.  All of my changes were pretty much suggested by another reviewer at some point.  I just adjusted to the most common suggestions and a few that I thought would be good ideas for our tastes.  With adding the peas and you have a one dish meal.

I did not have gravy, mushrooms, mushroom soup or cream cheese, instead I used beef broth, milk and sour cream. I sauteed onions, garlic and chopped carrots in olive oil and added to meat. I used spices salt, pepper, garlic salt, cumin. I also added butter to noodles and sauce. I served with a Greek salad on the side. It came out yummy!

Very quick, easy & uses ingredients that you usually have in your pantry...the only thing I did differently is use a can of golden mushroom instead of cream of chicken..also added a little Worcestershire sauce...I agree with the other reviewers that this is a wonderful recipe but it is quite bland...I will make again but probably use more Worcestershire or something to pep it up a bit.

It did't take me long to figure out what this dish was missing.  Sherry.  A couple of glugs and it tastes authentic.

Really tasty! My only advise is to salt and pepper to taste. That was the only thing I added!

This was very good considering I was able to whip it up for a quick dinner. My kids and husband both really liked it. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and pepper.

Yummy to my tummy ! I'm finishing a plate as I type, lol but this was really tasty! My whole family was nervous every while I was cooking asking me questions like what in the heck is beef stroganoff? & ugh it's another recipe you looked up? Lol but yeah we enjoyed it, it did make a lot which worked well in my favor because I fed up to 5 people and still have some left over for tomorrow to eat. The only thing that I did differently was add diced onions and bell peppers to my meat while cooking the beef which is pretty much what I usually do to all of my meats to add a little more flavor. I also added lady's garlic salt while stirring in the last ingredient. Other than that this was a very yummy recipe and I will be using this again!!! Thank :)

I made this tonight,  and it won't be the last. I needed to switch it up due to a couple mistakes.  I thought I had ground beef at home but no. Thank goodness I had bought ground turkey today just to have on hand. I did buy a packet of beef gravy but that packet never made it home. Aaah but I did have a packet of turkey gravy in the pantry.  I akso wanted to try it with onions so chopped up one small one. I don't recall seeing seasonings but I added in some salt and ground pepper. DELICIOUS! ! Thank you. one bowl full was very filling.

We halved the sour cream, cream cheese, and soup. Really good beef flavor with gravy packet. A little on the drier side this way. Overall it was good.

Lacks flavor and sauce is really thick.  I added fresh thyme and freshly ground black pepper to bump up the flavor.  I also added about a half cup of chicken broth to thin it a little, but it was still a lot thicker than I like.  I left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them,  but I don't think that makes a big difference flavor wise. I did use cream of mushroom soup as directed.  If I make this again I will mix the brown gravy with the liquid as directed on the gravy packet before adding it to the meat, reduce the amount of cream cheese,  and add some garlic.

I think it is important to season the beef in the beginning (after you drain, but if you use a lean pack like 10% fat, keep the juices!). As salty as the gravy and cream of mushroom are, the meat texture is much more dense and lingers longer than the soft noodles and sauce. Onion, garlic, SALT AND PEPPER. 
Used fresh sliced mushrooms. Added parsley for some color.

I've made this several times.  It's become one of my fav go-to recipes.  I substitute ground turkey for the beef, and sometime use Rigatoni instead of the egg noodles.  For enriched taste, I ensure to put my own choice of light- to moderate- seasoning on the meat along with the other ingredients called for.  It's only me, so I halven all ingredients, which still leaves a couple days' worth leftovers.  Quick and easy.  I enjoy every time!!

I make this at least once a week per the request of my boyfriend. This is a great dish to add veggies to. I add peas to the finished product at times for a slightly different taste in each bite. We like parmesan cheese on top and grilled asparagus on the side. Yum!

I made this dish EXACTLY as the recipe instructs.  So my review is based on the ACTUAL recipe, not some modified version.

My family LOVES this dish!!  Very easy to make (only 2 pans needed!) and good for leftovers.  This has become a regular in our household:)

I decided to leave the mushrooms out (I love them but my fiancee hates them) so I added some water to the hamburger mixture, but it seemed to come out wayyy too thick.  And so the final dish seems excessively thick.  I like the flavor of the sour cream and cream cheese together, but they didn't blend as well as I'd hoped.  I feel like there's something missing to meld it all together.  I also wish there was some seasoning advice in the recipe.

I made this today according to the recipe except for exchanged keys for the mushrooms since the kids won't eat mushrooms. Of course when it was cooked and then I had to add salt and pepper to taste and overall I just found it even with as much cream cheese and sour cream it still just lacked something. Like others have said its a good base recipe but I think next time I'll add some cheddar cheese soup to it in place of one of the cans of mushroom soup.

I made this with all the listed (forgot the dang mushrooms at the store though...) ingredients with a few tweaks. IT WAS AMAZING! My Wife and I both loved it (she's the picky eater btw ;). It was dinner and didn't make it past lunch today.
First part : I pre cooked the burger with a touch of ground pepper, dash of Worcestershire and granulated garlic. Cooked the Amish egg noodles in a light amount of beef stock (Better than Bouillon brand)  in the water (yes you can do that!) strained and set aside.
Second part: I did this a hour or so later, used half of the cream cheese, cream mushroom soup and subbed the sour cream with 2% plain good for you Greek yogurt (careful, greek yogurt is not good at high heat due to low fat content) and 2% lowfat milk. Cooked on low and slowly added the milk till I got the consistency I liked. Added the noodles and beef and simmered for 5 minutes stirring slowly. It was the perfect amount to cover and infuse the beef and noodles with flavor. I think it would NOT have been good using the full amount of cream cheese etc in my stupid opinion.
 Next I plan on making this swapping out the noodles for sliced potatoes. I shall call this dish Mike's Beef Potatoganoff! I'll post that if you guys want.

It was good but I would cut the cream cheese and sour cream as others suggested. I cut it and it was still very strong in both. I also used a stroganoff seasoning mix because my gravy mix went missing so that might have made a difference. I'll make it again because it was much much better then the boxed hamburger helper.

I made it per the directions.  It was good as is.  I will certainly make it again.  Next time I may add a few spices to try to tweak it for my particular tastes, but all in all it was good as is.

Made this as directed. Would change it up if I made it again.
Instead of the dry gravy mix - I would make the gravy, cut the cream cheese and soup in half and add meatballs

I only had brown gravy in a jar. I used only half. The kids loved it and that's always a plus for me!

I made this recipe this evening for my family. I made some changes to the amount of several ingredients and added other stuff. First I cut the recipe in half and only used 4 oz. cream cheese, 4 oz. sour cream, and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Instead of using canned mushrooms, I used fresh mushrooms and  added 1/2 of a yellow onion sliced and 1 can of peas. I sautéed the onions and mushrooms first in olive oil and garlic salt.  Then followed the original recipe in its entirety step by step process. It turned out great and was definitely a success because my 2 year old son ate his entire serving! I'll be making this again in the future for a quick meal.

This was a hit with my family!  I took the other reviewers advice and cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half and added a little more milk so it wasn't so thick. .  I also used a can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom vs. the Cream of Mushroom.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in some butter and garlic.   Served it with some Italian green beans and Hawaiian rolls.

This a good base.  The changes I did was used trimmed cubed bottom roast.  I browned the meat in about 2 Tbls of olive oil, added salt, pepper and garlic to taste.  I drained the meat add all the other ingredients as the direction call for.  We like the sharpness of sour cream the amount definitely adds it.

My Husband loves beef stroganoff so I knew I had to try my hand at making it. The old saying " the way to a man's heart is through his stomach" is true. I have a rather large family (6 of us) so I had to double the recipe and that still wasn't enough for them. I had to make this 2 nights in a row! The second night was better since I doubled the cream of mushroom soup, much more creamy sauce. Now the next test is for me to take some to work for out pot-luck lunch. :)

I made a 1/2 recipe and used mushroom gravy and fresh mushrooms as I had those on hand. It turned out great and even my 1 1/2 year old ate it! (We are going through a picky phase.) This recipe does make a lot and next time I will add a little more milk just to make the sauce a little creamer, but it is a very good recipe.

This was way too creamy for my taste. I ended up not using the sour cream, and only  2/3 of the cream cheese . Glad I didn't put the whole stick in!

I made as directed except I left out the can of mushrooms and added diced onion to the hamburger, this is because I like mushroom flavor but do not like the texture. The cream cheese is very overpowering as others suggest I will 1/2 the amount next time and I think I might double the dry gravy mix or add another mix of some kind ( I have a mushroom burger grillmaster dry mix in my cupboard I wish I would have added, I might for leftovers) This recipe made a lot more than I expected it fed me and my 3 kids and there is plenty for all 5 of us to have lunch tomorrow as well.

I started making this, making only a few tweaks. I used fresh mushrooms, and added onions. I also cut out half of the cream cheese. After that, it was still way too thick, so I added more milk. I also added some worcheshire sauce, and a pinch of beef  boullion, because the taste wasn't as beefy as  I like my stroganoff. Good base recipe, but had to make a lot of changes.

This is a great quick and easy recipe. We devoured this, I did make a couple of changes due to what I had in my fridge. I put 4oz of cream cheese, 4oz of sour cream, the balance I made up for with plain Greek yogurt. When I put in the cream of mushroom I only did half and then let everything sit and added 1/2 tablespoon or so of Dijon mustard. After about 5 min I added the other 1/2 of cream of mushroom to keep everything really mois and served after a few min.

Yes, simple  Not exactly fresh food, but good flavor, nice recipe for the not so experienced cook. It is basically package, can, ready to use, processed products.  I suggest only 1 can soup, 1/2 block cream cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream.  Good recipe for a teenager to prepare.  Pair with peas or green beans.

Always had traditional stroganoff as a kid, but my boyfriend's mom made with ground beef so I decided to try this. Although traditional is worth the time, this recipe definitely gets big results with just a little effort. Boyfriend was nodding his head at me a lot during dinner:) Sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic before adding ground beef and seasoned beef with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder (because we like it). Cut the recipe by half, possibly 3/4 next time for just the two of us.

This is a great base recipe easy to tweak to your family's liking. Mine asked it be added to the regular meal rotation! I sliced and diced fresh mushrooms and onion I had on hand, cooking with the ground beef. Added a dash of garlic powder and nutmeg to the sauce mixture, and pepper to taste. Second time I wanted to make it a little healthier so used reduced fat cream cheese, light sour cream, and reduced to one can of soup. I did have to add a little more milk, but the end result was just as good!

If you are looking for an easy, tasty beef stroganoff recipe this is it!  I have a few things to say, so bear with me!  Based on the few reviews I read, I changed things slightly and it turned out great!
I only used 4 oz cream cheese.  Also, I used low fat sour cream.  I also used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef because that is how much was in the package I had.  I'm glad I used the extra beef.  Otherwise I think there may have been too much sauce to meat ratio.  The following is very important-- I seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced onions, thyme and marjoram while cooking.  I think this recipe would have been too bland otherwise.
Also, the step that says to mix the mushroom soup, milk and sour cream to noodles you do not have to do it that way.  I mixed those ingredients in a bowl, then stirred it into the pan containing the beef mixture.  I did this because my husband likes regular egg noodles and I use wheat egg noodles.  By mixing it this way we could spoon the stroganoff sauce onto our noodles to taste.  
This stroganoff is very rich and delicious.  Easy for a week night dinner.

I helped my 11 year old make this and it was a big hit! Much better than the hamburger helper variety. We used fresh mushrooms and added quite a bit more salt and pepper- also more milk(it was very thick) but it was still super yummy. It was easy & just as fast as the box mix.

Good flavor, but very very rich - I think I'd cut the cream cheese in half, and maybe also the sour cream and soup.

My mom has been making this recipe for years and is the ultimate comfort food! My family usually makes it the same as the recipe above then mixes it together, puts some buttered breadcrumbs on top and bakes it in oven til the breadcrumbs are crisp. Love that it is easy to make, inexpensive, and the leftovers are even better. I usually will add the same as others...onion, garlic, 1 cup of frozen corn, and buttered breadcrumbs on top.

Made this for my girlfriend and she cleaned her plate.  I did what a lot of commenters did and went with half the sour cream and cream cheese.  I added some Greek seasoning, onion powder, and garlic salt and it turned out really tasty.  Will be making again!

It was ok. I usually don't follow a recipe exactly, but I had the ingredients...so I did. The cream cheese is too much and it's too thick. It's not a true stroganoff. Next time I am just going to wing it. Unfortunately, I have to figure out how to doctor it up so I can eat up the rest. =(

This was a good recipe and I was able to make it within a short time. I used only 1 can of the mushroom soup and did use fresh garlic and onion when cooking the hamburger. Yummy!!

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make. I used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. I doubled the meat and the mushrooms (we like leftovers) and kept the amounts of the other ingredients the same.

Just made this for supper tonight & it was a hit with my husband. I used 2 pounds ground beef with chopped onion, 8oz of fresh mushrooms & a minced garlic clove. I also cut the recipe down to 6oz. of the cream cheese, 6oz. sour cream & only one can of the cream of mushroom soup from reading the prior reviews. It is definitely being saved in my recipe box! So easy to make too.

Easy and pretty tasty, but very thick and high in calories. I like to try a recipe as is first, and then customize. Next time I think I'll follow the other suggestions to cut the cream cheese, sour cream and soup and add garlic and onion and maybe red wine. But a good start!

Quick and easy, but way too much cream cheese. It is overwhelming. 

I'm trying to think how to save the rest of this. My family wont eat it and I don't want to throw away this much food. 

I will try it again but with half the cream cheese and less sour cream too.

This was really good, but it was really rich. I might make this again with low fat cream cheese and sour cream. I also think it could use a little seasoning to spice it up. Overall a good recipe.

Just tried this recipe and it is amazing! I did change a few things about it, though. I added about a quarter of a cup more milk, half the sour cream, and I added salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and beef bouillon seasoning to taste! Everyone loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

I cut the cream cheese by half, used one can of golden mushroom soup and one can of cream of mushroom, and two four ounce cans of sliced mushrooms.  Other than that, the only thing I did differently was the steps since they didn't make sense to me.

I browned the ground beef and drained it, then added the brown gravy powder, milk, soups, mushrooms, and cream cheese.  I cooked that on medium low until the cream cheese was melted and the whole thing was bubbly.  I cooked the noodles in the meantime.  After I added the meat mixture to the noodles, I stirred in the sour cream.

I think next time I might try adding a splash of wine to give it a little lift.

This was amazing!  

In some ways it was TOO amazing, with a very full fat feel to it even though we used a lower fat cream cheese.  We also used fresh mushrooms since we had them on hand.

Next time I'll add some frozen or fresh pees and/or corn for a little more texture and pop.

This recipe was pretty good and very easy to make. I did alter the seasonings though because it was quite bland. I added a small diced onion to the hamburger while cooking it and added garlic powder, salt, and pepper. In my opinion it was pretty good but I think next time I will try it with fresh mushrooms. It makes a lot of sauce so at least you have some extra for those who want more.

It was a very easy recipe. To give it a little more umph, I used a small jar of beef gravy instead of the mix. Also I used less of the sour cream and all the cream cheese. For the beef while it browning, I add garlic powder, salt & pepper. To finish the dish, fresh parsley leaves chopped and sprinkled over the mixture. Good eats.

This was a hit dinner. My husband loves stroganoff so I was a little nervous to make it for him but he went back for seconds which is the best review he can  ever give. Everyone else in the house liked it as well and I made it as written other than throwing in maybe half a cup of diced onions I needed to use up. It was a nice addition but likely unnecessary. I will experiment with cutting the cream cheese in half next time to see the difference. It makes a lot as previously mentioned but I doubt the leftovers will last long.

I rated this recipe 4 of 5 only braise the original was a little less than my ideal taste.  I added 2 tsp dill and 3 tsp worcestershire sauce to give it a bolder flavor.  This recipe is so much easier than the one I previously used (not to mention cheaper) and it still tastes delish!  I definitely will make it again with my minor modifications!

This was great!  Used the 2 cans of soup, sour cream, and milk but only 1/2 of the cream cheese.  Use beef base and some extra seasonings with the juice of the mushrooms.  Did sauté with pinions as I was browning the beef.  Served with buttered bread and a salad and it was a very hearty meal.  Will make this again and again I am sure.

6/6/14 Made at tweaked version of this recipe and it was great. I have tried many BS recipes and this one rates up at the top. I had to keep playing with spices at first because just seemed to be "just missing something". Think I finally got it right.  This was the first time I ever used cream cheese in my BS. To start I used a little more than 1 1/2 pounds ground beef. Added a lot more whole milk, (stopped keeping track after 2 cups), Worcester, cooked carrots I had in fridge, garlic, lawrys, bistro gravy powder about 1 1/2 T or more?,  1 package fresh mushrooms, and topped with fresh parsley. Was yummy!  Even with all the extra milk still nice, rich, creamy,  and thick. Everyone enjoyed. They all cleaned their plate and most went back for seconds. Even after seconds, still had a lot of leftovers,  will have enough for another meal and then some. Definitely will make again. 5 stars *****

Pretty good and simple recipe. It was a little too sour creamy for me though. Next time I think I'd rather use more milk instead of sour cream. I also added garlic salt, minced onion, and celery flakes. I'll definitely make it again.

Made this for dinner this eve for the 2 of us. I had a bag of frozen meatballs I had purchased and thought it would work. It was great! I did read other reviews and cut the cream cheese to about 1/2, added some onion, and I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup. Everything else I did per the recipe. Very good and there are leftovers! Yay!

Made this for my family tonight.  It was a hit.  I did use half of the sour cream and cream cheese and only one can of soup.  I also increased the milk to about a cup (didn't measure).  I added salt, pepper and some garlic salt to the meat while it cooked.  I also mixed all of the ingredients together separate from the noodles.  Then let my family add as much sauce as they wanted to their particular bowl of noodles.  Very easy, very quick...will make again.

Good overall, but it was a little bland at first.  I used only 12 oz of egg noodles (that was the size of the bag I picked), and I let them cook with the sauce for a while to try to pick up the flavors more, but I ended up adding a bit of garlic salt, and that fixed it.  Then I added some spinach (to pretend it was healthier), and my 3 year old wolfed it down :)  Also, this made a TON of food.  It was the equivalent of 2-3 boxes of hamburger helper when it was done, though MUCH more yummy.

Very tastey. I followed the recipe except I added about 2 cups of chicken broth and took advice from another review, adding onions, salt and pepper to mest mixture then stppoed. Usef rice instead of pasta so noushroom soup, etc was needed. Adfing the broth added the necesssry liquid.until it came to the pasts. Used rice instead

I left out the cream cheese totally as I was out I would have added 4 oz. I upped the ground beef by 1/2 lb. Left out gravy mix but added 2 tsp beef base to the browned ground beef. I didnt add the whole amount of milk just enough to get the consistency I wanted. Good stuff!

I wish I had read the reviews before I followed the recipe as it called for way too much cream cheese. When I was adding it I was thinking to myself this seems like too much, but I did it anyway. It was still edible but would have been so much better had I used half the amount of cream cheese. It seemed like that's all I could taste. Good base recipe though.

Ive made this several times. Tonight I completely transformed it. Instead of hamburger I used shredded chicken. Instead of dry brown gravy used chicken gravy. And replaced cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken. Omitted shrooms completely.  Family loved it. Hubby had two helpings

This one's a keeper.  Simple and easy.  Best of all my kids loved it. Used leftover hamburger and smoked fresh polish.  Also used sour cream w/ chives for a little more flavor.  Makes alot, so we froze half.  Will make again!

I really didn't like this one...coming from German background it honestly didn't taste much like mom made or a German restaurant would make...way too much sour cream, in fact, you probably don't need to add very much.  And as another reviewer had mentioned it was pretty over powering.  I would use just one can of soup or even just use beef gravy in lieu of the soup.

If you make this, cut the cream cheese by at least a 1/3rd.  Other than that it was vrey good.

i liked it, but the family thought it was a little bland- they added lots of pepper.. i think i might have added too much sour cream and/or cream cheese.. it was good, and will try it again.

Pretty good version but needs just a bit more in the flavor department.  I added garlic powder and pepper.  I also used rice because my family prefers it.  Next time I might cut back on the cream cheese but other than that we liked it.  I will make it again.

Yeah, this is good, and quick!  I liked it a lot, but found it to be pretty heavy in consistency.  However, for how fast it goes together, and the flavor that it has, this is excellent!!!

I will make this again. It was fairly easy....although you may as well just buy the hamburger helper....according to him there is no difference. I don't like making hamburger helper...hence me trying this again.  It was bland.  But then again stroganoff is bland.

Quick, weeknight meal.  I used 1.5 lbs of beef and a used a full 1.2 oz Knorr brown gravy packet, but reduced cream cheese to 6 oz and sour cream to 4 oz per others suggestions.  I flavored the meat with garlic powder and a pinch of salt.  The meat mixture was really good prior to mixing with the mushroom soup.  Then I think it lost some of its flavor and became more processed tasting.  This is a decent quick dinner but I might need to tweak the soup mixture portion next time.  BTW, the color of this meal was a light gray when prepared (yuck).  I suppose if I added all the cream cheese and sour cream it may have looked more creamy in color.

This recipe was awesome!  I also cut the cream cheese in half and added a small onion, but used a package of onion soup mix instead of the gravy mix.  My roommate and I both went back for seconds!

Very tasty! Made it just as the recipe called for except I added a chopped onion to the ground beef. When I heated up the leftovers the next day I added some milk to keep it saucy and it still tasted great. I will definitely make this again!

My family is in love with the hamburger helper stroganoff, but I hate making it due to all the salt and processed ingredients.  I made this the other night and it was a HUGE hit.  I used one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom.  I added onion and garlic to the hamburger and a few spoonfulls of sourcream to the soup mix.  A very easy recipe that both kids ate up without even picking out the veggies I threw in.  Deff a keeper!

This was great. I didn't need that much so I cut the ingredients in half. It was perfect!

I agree with another reviewer - good base to work from.  I cut the soup, low fat cream cheese, and low fat sour cream in half.  I made Knorr classic brown gravy as directed on the package before adding to the soup mixture.  I added coarsely cracked black pepper.  Lastly, I added a bag of Trader Joes mini party meatballs to the soup mixture instead of making meatballs.  Next time, going to try adding frozen sweet baby peas.  Good recipe!

Once I got into cooking this, I realized that the cream cheese would be a bit too much--so, I omitted the cream cheese, leaving in the sour cream. It came out nicely.  Adding a bit a sharp cheddar on at the end (to individual portions) gives it a nice kick, too.

It was ok.  It was really bland.  I didn't like it that much and I probably won't make it again.

Soooo Good!  My family raved about it and told me to make sure to keep it in the "make this again" collection.  I used a mushroom gravy I found instead of plain brown gravy and substituted Turkey for the beef.  I also used fat free sour cream AND cream cheese which still turned out so creamy and wonderful.  Thanks for this recipe it's a keeper!

This is good food.  I along with others recommend reducing the creamcheese to 1/2 or even 1/4.  And also, I recommend letting each person put the amount of sauce they want on the noodles instead of mixing it all together.

Very nice!  Inexpensive and extremely easy to prepare, and husband was wild about it.

For next time, I think after I combine the noodle mixture with the meat mixture, I will cook on the lowest setting stirring occaisionally OR just cover and allow to sit for about 5 minutes so that the cold ingredients that are added to the noodle mixture have a chance to get hot.  I found a couple of cold spots in my food while I was eating this.

Thanks for sharing, will DEFINITELY make this again!

Very delicious! I added onion and sauteed the mushrooms w/ the ground beef. I also doubled all ingredients except cream cheese, sour cream, and mushroom soup. The sauce was perfect this way, I can't imagine it being any thicker or richer!

I normally make a 3 hour Stroganoff (baked covered in the oven) and I have to say that this 30 min recipe was great.  The family loved it.

Wow - this is soooo good.  I used half the cream cheese as others recommended, used low fat sour cream and skim milk to help with all those calories and this was still so rich and tasty.  Also used fresh mushrooms and added onion and garlic in with hamburger. I used a packet of Knorr's au jus because I had it in my pantry and seemed to work just fine in lieu of the brown gravy packet. This is easy to prepare and makes a ton.  Will make again - nice winter time comfort food cuz it's heavy. Enjoy!!

Wow!  Another great recipe, thanks!  I halved the cream cheese, and added minced onion and garlic powder to the ground beef while cooking, and then once the sauce was made I added more garlic powder.  My husband couldn't keep his fork out of it!  This will be a keeper.

This is a good recipe.  I read the other reviews prior to making it and glad I did.  I added garlic and onion to the hamburger while cooking.  I also only made 1/2 the noodles and eliminated one can of soup.  It would have been fine with only 1/2 the cream cheese as well.  I will make this again, but probably not on a regular basis.

VERY easy to make... my kids loved it and they're rather picky eaters when it comes to trying something new.  I did add garlic and made it with fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese to ease my concious a little!  Also used a brand of egg noodles called "No Yolks"... taste just the same but without all of the artery clogging cholesterol. Wonderful recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We ate it for dinner last night and had the leftovers tonight. I used about half of the block of cream cheese, added a little sherry,added some garlic salt, and only used one can of cream of mushroom soup. Yum!

I was surprised how much we liked this one.  I thought the gravy packet would be gross, but it isn't.  My hubby loves it.  I also add chopped onion and some garlic (add those to almost everything).  I prefer fresh mushrooms, so I use those.  Very quick, very easy, very filling, good ole comfort food.

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but forgot the fresh mushrooms and it was still good. 
Next time I'll play with it and jazz it up a bit more with some minced onion and garlic sauteed with the beef. 
It isn't as good as my standard stroganoff but it sure beats the heck out of the box stuff!!

I did as others suggested and cut the cream cheese in half. I thought this recipe was great! My children gobbled it up. So of course this was a winner for my family. Its a really simple dish.

Very Easy!  This is the first recipe I haven't screwed up!  It came out great!  I had enough for myself and two grown men for TWO meals.  It freezes well too.
Thanks!

Wow!  Who could have thought that this would be so good!  It was cheap, easy and super delicious!  The only changes I made were I omitted one of the cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I will ALWAYS use this recipe in the future!

This is a great recipe. I did add garlic and onion seasonings. I also made the sauce all together with the beef and poured it over the noodles. It was very delicious and my husband and daughter loved it too.

This was good.  I liked the taste with the cream cheese.  I have made it more then once.  The last time I didn't have a packet of gravy mix so I used some 2 cubes of beef bouillon instead and it was good!

I came across this recipe this morning and I made it this afternoon. It was delicious.  I made it exactly how the recipe said and there was enough to feed 7 instead of 6. We all had seconds too.
It makes alot.  Everyone loved it! It was very very easy to make.  I will definitely make this for the next family event.

Great, easy recipe. I took the advice of previous posters and used half of cream cheese. I also added a 1/4 cup of water to thin out. Both changes made recipe good.

This was really, really good. I cook a lot of pasta dishes so I decided to serve it over brown rice, cooked separately.   Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I had enough left over to serve the neighbors and they loved it too!

This is just like a recipe I lost some time ago, Thanks! The only difference is that with mine you sprinkle poppy seeds over the top-very pretty and tops it off perfectly.

I omitted the chopped mushrooms and used 3 packets of brown gravy mix and 1 packet of onion gravy mix. i also cooked my ground beef with chopped onions and garlic. this gave it a better flavor, but it is still missing something. this is a great base, but i will continue to tweek it.

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I decreased the cream cheese to half and only used one can of soup (reduced fat).  I also browned the ground beef with diced onion and garlic.

I found a cream of mushroom and garlic soup that really added great flavor to this recipe.  I also added two cloves of garlic and about half an onion.  I left out the mushrooms because I just don't care for them.  Quick, easy, and delicious.

Ok, I did not care for the ground beef in this recipe. Try using thinly sliced sirloin or pork cubes - much better.

As for the sauce, I used half the cream cheese and added some onion and garlic to the meat when browning it. I also added about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. Mix it all together and pour over the cooked noodles.

I thought this recipe was just okay, but my husband liked it.  The sauce was thick even with only 1/2 the cream cheese. It just seemed to be missing something in terms of flavor...I may try to find another similar recipe or switch this one up a bit.

okay, so here's what i did:
when i browned the beef (a little over 1 lb.), i included a few cloves of minced garlic and about half a sweet onion, minced and salt & pepper to taste. once browned, i mixed in 2 tbsp. worcestershire sauce, a 1.25 oz. packet of mushroom & herb gravy (that's what i had on hand) and can of 'shrooms with liquid. then i mixed in 4 oz. of cream cheese until completely combined.
then i mixed a can and a half of the cream of 'shroom soup and a cup of milk. while it simmered, i cooked the whole 16 oz. package of egg noodles. to serve, we topped the noodles with the burger sauce by the plate and then added our own individual amount of sour cream. this was so awesome!!! it made for great leftovers, too!

The best for what it is...a homey comfort dish.  The only different I did was add some minced garlic and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce when I was adding the ground beef.  I went against popular opinion and added the complete 8 oz. of cream cheese (Neufchatel actually).  May picker eater cleaned her plan sans mushrooms.  The good eater exclaimed "this is good".  Thanks!

This was very good but extremely rich in taste! I wish I would have read the reviews first because I would have cut the cream cheese amoount in half llike suggested. Ok so here is what I did diferently- I only had one cream of mush. soup so I threw in a cream of celery for the second soup, used 1 1/2 pds of ground beef, did not have cream cheese so I poured in a tiny bit of whipping cream, added some garlic powder and fresh pepper, also did not have powdered gravy mix so I just used the can of beef gravy and instead of egg noodles I poured over penne noodles.  Turned out very good and will definatly make again....just with not as much cream cheese.

Simple and tasty. I cut the cream cheese down to 4 oz and didn't miss the extra. Also, I combined all the ingredients and simmered in a skillet for 10 minutes and served it over white rice, instead of mixing it with the egg noodles. Thanks!

Searched the web and finally found this recipe that matched the one my mother made for us as children in the late 50's, using hamburger instead of sirloin and we loved it!  Glad I found it!

This was a little too bland for us.  If I make it again I will use garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of canned as they tasted a little metallic.

I really liked this recipe.  I halved the cream cheese at the suggestion of the other reviewers, and I wish I had halved the mushrooms.  Also, next time I will use onions, as it was a little bland without it.

Delicious! I did make some changes (sorry all those that hate recipe alterations)... I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used 4 ounces sour cream and 4 ounces cottage cheese. I didn't use canned mushrooms, but used 8 ounces fresh, sliced mushrooms. In place of the mushroom juice from the can, I used heavy cream. I used a Beef Gravy with Herbs gravy mix. I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup (low fat), so I also used a can of cream of celery soup. Mine turned out deliciously! So creamy and flavorful! Thank you for the diving board!

Can't believe it, sour cream and cream of mushroom soup and DH loved it!  I did used 1.5# GB seasoned with garlic, onion, salt & pepper and reduced the soup to 1 can.  Added the mushroom liquid but had to serve the mushrooms on the side.  Will be made again at our house!

Good family recipe!  My kids (ages 2 and 5) loved it.  They gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  I thought the sour cream taste was a bit strong and the sauce turned out a bit thick.  I will make this again, but I will decrease the sour cream and increase the milk.  This does make a BIG batch--it could easily feed my family of 4 for two meals.

This recipe is awesome. I decided to make this before I read the reviews. I do that a lot because sometimes the reviews are misleading because everyone's tastes are different. I did change a couple things because of what I had on hand. I used two pounds of ground beef and I used a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of one of the cans of cream of mushroom. yummy and enough to feed an army.

I cut down on the soup, sour cream and cream cheese and this recipe was still very creamy.

The Betty Crocker recipe already includes those modifications, so i'll just stick to that one.

But in general, I'd reccomend this dish.  It is very filling.

I made some modifications and this turned out great. I cut out the cream cheese, used only one can of soup, and added extra spices (grated onion, garlic powder to taste and dried dill weed to taste). I will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews and decided to go on my own as to what my family likes and made sure I tasted as I cooked.   Ingredients wise I ended up changing the cream cheese to 4 ounces and the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  Otherwise I kept everything else as is.  I did add some garlic to the meat as it was browning.  I just mixed everything together and we thought it was wonderful and had just the right amount of creaminess.  Thanks Jessica!

Very good basic recipe.  Changed it a tad to fit our tastes.  We make this similar recipe 1-2 times/month at our house.  I love creamy stroganoff!  YUM!

I made a few changes to this recipe based on other people's reviews and it turned out really well.  I halved the sour cream and soup, and it still turned out really creamy.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Minced garlic, salt and pepper also really helped with the flavouring.  Will make it again.

This is really good.  I used fat free sour cream, lowfat cream cheese, lowfat soup and 4% ground beef.  I will be making this again.

I followed the recipe pretty closely; I mixed all the ingredients into the skillet with the beef, instead of combining the sourcream and soup with the pasta first. I also omitted one can of soup. I used brown gravy mix out of a large container, instead of an individual packet (probably about 2 Tbs). I think that this was very easy and fairly tasty... there was something about the flavor I really wasn't thrilled with. I think it was the hamburger honestly, I think this would have tasted better to me with a cut of steak instead of hamburger. I might make it again, but I think I would use something other than hamburger next time, I would also half the cream cheese!

"The best stroganoff ever!" according to my hubby.  I omitted the milk and 1 can of soup and substituted 2 cans of beef broth.  Also sauted some chopped onion and garlic with hamburger.  I will make this frequently as it came together fast and was delicious!!

Excellent!  I used one package of Lipton's Beefy ONion soup mix (dry) instead of the gravy mix because that's what I had on hand.  I think this would serve at least 8.  Thanks, Jessica!

This was surprisingly good for such a "throw-together" kind of meal.  I took others' recommendations and halved the sour cream and cream cheese.  It came out perfect.  Use low-salt ingredients where you can.  The whole family really enjoyed it.  Thanks, Jessica!
