This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I make it often.  I don't agree with some of the other raters who say that the pasta is bland; I think it is great, and the taco seasoning is enough for me.  The only thing I wold suggest is to add two tablespoons of sour cream to both layers of the macaroni and cheese.  This is a VERY VERY easy recipe that will please most people.

A few changes were made to this recipe. It wasn't spicy enough. I made the macaroni instead of using the frozen. I used all of the taco seasoning and used jalapeno pepper juice instead of water for the taco seasoning preparation. To make it more spicier I will ad cayenne pepper to the mix next time. My husband said that It was the perfect meal for those times when you cant figure out just what you want.

I used Fritos in place of the tortilla chips the first time I made this and we prefer them now.

This recipe was not bad but not great either.  The pasta was a bit bland and there wasn't really enough flavor from the rest of the ingredients to save it.  If I make this again I will be using a lot more seasonings. My 2 year old just ate the mac n' cheese part.

I only rated this 4 stars because it's very easy to make and my kids love it... but I thought it lacked flavor.  Since I always make mac'n'cheese from scratch with whole wheat pasta, my first attempt was a bit dry - will sauce it up more next time. Will also take other's suggestions to add some tomato sauce to the meat mixture as well as more spice.  All in all a very good recipe. Thanks!

My picky kids loved this easy casserole!  Although I added 1 lb. of ground beef instead of just a 1/2 lb.  It just didn't seem enough.  I also used 2 T. sour cream in each layer of macaroni as suggested by another member.  I had to use crushed potato chips instead of tortilla chips because that was what I had on hand.  I think this one is pretty failproof.  Quick, easy and kid-friendly.  Great for weeknights!  Thanks!

Simply and tasty dish. Kids loved it. Can't really go wrong with Mac & Cheese! Will try to sample using more spices and adding some that I like of my own next time. Very easy and quick to make when in a hurry. Used microwave to defrost the Macaroni & Cheese. Thanks! It's a keeper

This is one of the best "Quick" meals I have made in a while. I didn't add that much sour cream, just enough to make a difference, and it was great. My boyfriend liked it a lot, and it's tough to please him!

This was my first recipe that I have made from allrecipes.com and I must admit..I am hooked! Leftovers are just as good, if not better! Just zap it in the mirco and BAM! I did add a bit more sour cream, only because I love dairy :) Other than that, I highly recommend this recipe if you want something quick, easy and delicious!!

My husband would give this five stars, he loved it.  He actually said it was the best thing hes ever eaten.  I do agree it was very tasty.  Just also fattening, i used LF sour cream, and very lean meat, but still felt I was eating junk food.  But it was delicious.

This is pretty good, although I've made a few changes.  I never did try it with frozen mac and cheese--I've always used Kraft mac and cheese in the box--and I always use leftover taco meat for the meat layers.  It's a quick and easy meal, and the kids like it!  Thanks!

Even after reading the rave reviews I was sceptical, but this was really, really good.  Even my picky 2 year-old loved it.  I did however, use a 20 oz. frozen pkg. of Amy's Organic Mac n Cheese (to make it less junkfood-like), a whole lb. of ground chuck (made using the instructions on the pkg. of taco seasoning), and more crushed tortilla chips and cheese than what the recipe called for.  I felt this hamburger/noodle ratio was great.  I topped it off with mild jalapeno slices which I definitely recommend for a great flavor.  Then, top off the finished product with sour cream.  Mmmm, mmm, good.  Even the leftovers were delicious.

Used 2 (8oz) packages of mac & cheese, 1lb of ground beef, entire package of taco seasoning, 3/4 can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup of cheese. It turned out fine, tasted like mexican hamburger helper but with less salt.

Pretty good! I added some tomato sauce to the beef and a little more taco seasoning. Nice easy meal!
