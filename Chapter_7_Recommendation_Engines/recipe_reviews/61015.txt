I was a little nervous about the combinations of vegetables in this relish, and was really surprised and how well recieved this side was.  Only one person in the family likes beets plain, even I only like beets pickled.  I added a little extra sugar while boiling as I knew if it was too sour, no one would touch it.  I served mine slightly above room temperature, great to make ahead and let sit in the microwave.  The beets were nice and sweet and delicious, I used two cans of whole beets to cut back on time and quartered them.

We have shares in a local farm, and sometimes we get vegetables we aren't particularly fond of.  My husband has never been partial to beets, but said "If I have to eat beets, this is a tolerable way to have them."  I like beets, and thought this was great.  It made a wonderful side for grilled pork chops, and the beautiful color would dress up any plate.

I made this with bottled pickled beets. I didn't have celery seed so I left that out, and I used white balsamic vinegar and apple cider vinegar. I had it as a side with quiche and a regular chopped salad. Good stuff. Thanks!

I was looking for a new veggie dish and beets are so good for you so I thought I would try this out and I liked it very much so thanks for a great recipe! I didn't have any celery seed so I skipped the salt and just used celery salt.

When I read "beetroot"   I knew you were a fair dinkum Aussie.  While haven't made relish yet, plan to do in next few days.  Sounds fabulous.

I love making pickles, chutneys and relishes.  I think I will stick to the beetroot relish recipe that I have been making for years.  Didn't care for this one.

I love beets, especially if they're pickled. I think this will be an excellent side dish or condiment with just about anything. I might add a bit of spice or vinegar to it next time.

Did not have any apples but made it anyway was lovely, I cut the beetroot into quarters and thinly sliced to create petals. Have added it to my recipe collection as a must make often dish.

This was my first relish experience. I was a little timid and didn't have the correct ingredients. I was out of mustard and celery seed and used Apple cider vinegar instead. So I ended up using ground mustard seed and just omitted the celery seed. This turned out really good. Mine took longer than the instructed 30 mins to soften, it was closer to 50 mins. Served this warm, then put remaining amount in a plastic container in the fridge. Had some for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. I will make again with proper ingredients. My only complaint, it was too salty, will consider using half the amount of salt next time.
