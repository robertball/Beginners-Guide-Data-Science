These are good but do not give a wow factor.  Rather than chocolate covered mints, I used Andes Peppermint Crunch Mints that I had left over from Christmas baking.  The dough was very sticky coming from the fridge after several hours, but wetting my fingertips I was able to form the healthy one tablespoon of dough around the mint.  After 10 minutes they were done.  I'll see what my little tasters think of these!  They are my meter for whether something gets made again!
