This is a holiday favorite.  Shaped like a pinecone it really is a great one to bring to a party or to serve for one.  It's also delicious!

We've made this dip for 30 years. Originally from Kraft foods. We do it as a pinecone for Christmas + in a hollowed out red cabbage in the summer w/ veggies.
Fantastic. Make this, the flavors meld together great.

I misplaced this recipe years ago and forgot about it.  I used the ingredients search tool and am very glad it was on this site.  Time to add it back in to my collection!

We have made this for about 30 yrs. My mom found it in a magazine which is still in with the cookbooks.  It is a favorite for potlucks,for family gatherings and tomorrow I am sending it to school for my son's English class celebration. Beautiful presentation, amazing taste and always a huge hit!! Wish I could give it more than 5 stars

I like this one,  you can bring it out right away, when you need one fast for guest's,  or a quick meal plan.  I did not change this recipe, it was great!

With the exception of cooking the bacon, my kid made this entire recipe by his self and molded it into a hedgehog. Our Thanksgiving guests were impressed. Although we hesitated to ruin his fine work, everyone eventually ate it up.

Brought this to a party last night and no one wanted to eat it because it was so beautiful!  Eventually someone tried it and then it disappeared very quickly.

So GOOD! I made this last week for a party at the office. It went by really fast. Next time I am going to try using roasted almonds
