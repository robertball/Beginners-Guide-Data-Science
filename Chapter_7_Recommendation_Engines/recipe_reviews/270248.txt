This recipe needs salt!  Yes, this should be called “Greek” because oregano and lemon are quintessential Greek ingredients.  They use it on everything!  Where we have sour cream and onion flavored potato chips they have oregano flavored potato chips.  And Greek oregano is the best oregano.  So throw in some salt, kalamatas, or feta—anything that will add the punch of salt this recipe so desperately needs.

I saw this recipe yesterday AM, had chicken thighs, so made it last night.  We love chicken thighs, and this was very tasty.  I did however, use Greek Seasoning instead of oregano, and also added some halved Kalamara  olives. I couldn't figure out why this dish was called "Greek", w/o anything authentically Greek in the recipe.  Perhaps calling it "Greek Style" would have made more sense.  I gave it 4*s, but that was after I made a couple of changes to the original recipe.
