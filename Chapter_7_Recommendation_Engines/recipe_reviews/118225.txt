I too changed this a little based on another viewers suggestion.  Instead of using spaghetti sauce, I used a tomato puree.  For the spices, I used 1 packet of taco seasoning.  Using 1/2 of it while cooking the meat and adding the other half with the tomato puree.  I also added garlic, since I put it in everything I cook.  I did not rinse the meat.  I simmered it without the beans and corn and added them later.  I also added 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika.  Great recipe.

Absolutely a 5 star with a few changes: Skip the rinsing of the meat - why??? I used Fire Roasted Diced Tomato, Trader Joes roasted corn, added a chopper Adobo chile, an extra can (8oz) of tomoato sauce, a packet of Taco Seasoning and 2 tsp of ground Cumin. Enough for two meals, and it freezes splendidly!

I made this almost exactly as the recipe directed. Substituted ground turkey for beef, and used Rotel instead of the separate cans of chilis and tomatoes. I really like the way this turned out, but as far as having a Mexican flavor, I'd have to disagree. It's more Southwest-ish. I think next time I might try adding some taco seasoning to see if it takes away some of the sweetness of the spaghetti sauce. All in all, a good recipe that's quite affordable and it makes a ton of food.

Delicious and a keeper. I added garlic and green/ red bell peppers and omitted the corn. I topped this with cheddar/mozzarella cheese, sour cream and green onions. My son said it was the best spaghetti ever and he gobbled it up. Great blend of flavors. Thanks!

This made a lot!  It had a lot of flavor and is one of the few pasta dishes that doesn't need cheese.  I mixed 1/2 lb elbow macaroni and 1/2 lb penne with this and I got 13 good sized servings.

This is a great twist on the usual pasta sauce.  I had red chile spaghetti to use and this sauce was perfect for it.

However, I did have to add more seasoning to get rid of the Italian taste of the sauce.  When cooking the meat (ground sirloing) - strange, involved directions by the way - my own way, I added granulated garlic, white pepper, and diced onion.  Then to the sauce I added 1/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon jalapeno powder, and 1/4 teaspoon chipotle (smoked jalapeno) powder.  Only then did it taste "southwestern/Mexican".

AWESOME! I'm not a huge spaghetti sauce fan but when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I made it almost to recipe; the only changes I made were more beans, I added a little bit of louisiana hot sauce and I topped it with cheese. So tasty... my picky roommate even liked it!

I liked it : )  I omitted the hot water and paper towel step and just put the ground beef and onion in a strainer for about 10 minutes after browning.  Then added some crushed red pepper flakes.  I will make it again!  Thanks!
