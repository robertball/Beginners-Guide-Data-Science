Seriously sausage gravy and biscuits is my absolute favorite breakfast, so when I saw this recipe with an Italian twist, I could not wait to try it for dinner, and let me tell you it did not disappoint my family!!!  I followed the recipe to the tee, the fresh sage is a must…it just adds a subtle flavor that complements the sausage and Classico sauce very well!  I can’t wait to try this over pasta too!

We loved this!  I made brunch with this as the main dish.  I made 2 very minor adjustments rubbed sage in place of fresh leaves and I made my own biscuits.  The next time I make this, and I will for sure, I will dilute the sauce a bit with milk to cut the saltiness.  This is inherent in the sauce and no reflection of Duboo's recipe.  Very rich and decadent comfort food. Thanks!

My 15 year old daughter was on deck to make supper tonight so she picked this recipe to go with the Italian sausage that was on the menu.  She was in the mood for biscuits and gravy!  We are in the middle of a major deep freeze and nobody wanted to go out to get the Alfredo sauce and the refridgerated biscuits that the recipe called for from the store.  Lol!  We happened to have all the ingredients at home so we decided to make a homemade 4 cheese Alfredo sauce and homemade baking powder biscuits.  My daughter and I tag-teamed the meal preparation and dinner was on the table in an hour!  We paired it with a vegetable salad.  The whole family loved this meal...it was delicious!!!
Thanks for submitting this recipe.  It was a great lesson for my daughter to “think outside the box” and come up with an alternative if all the ingredients were not readily available!  The joy of cooking with my daughter was priceless!!!

Duboo, this is a really good idea.  I took it a little further than what you called for, however, because I needed to use up a couple of food items in my pantry!  First, I had some leftover grilled pork chops and wanted to make a hot sandwich with them.  I also had some of Chef John's Homemade Hamburger Buns in my freezer!  So I cut the pork thin, toasted the hamburger bun with butter, made the sandwich,  and poured your sausage sauce over the top.  The only thing I did different was to use thyme rather than sage (personal preference).  It did take a little more sauce vs sausage than called for, but it worked since we were not using the whole recipe.  We very much enjoyed our sandwich tonight!  Hubby thanks you, too!

This was delish! I added some sage, giving my gravy a darker color but really yummy none the less! Thanks Duboo; ):

A bit saltier than I expected but still a nice occasional change from regular biscuits and gravy.

This was very flavorful and easy to whip up. It just wasn't what I was looking for.  It has a very different flavor than good ol' biscuits and gravy, and shame on me for not realizing that before I prepared it.  Still, if you like Italian sausage and alfredo, I would recommend it.

Awesome quick and easy recipe. I did add chopped roasted red peppers for added color and flavor. Also added chopped pepperoncini's. (Both were Mezzetta from a jar).  I also added some whole milk as it seemed really thicker than I like.

Absolutely loved this version of biscuits and gravy.  We did it over thin spaghetti and it was really good, but will serve over biscuits, English muffins or toast next time.  Very easy and delicious.

Made it exactly to recipe.  Thought it was a bit salty, maybe the red wine I was drinking made my tongue sensitive.  My wife loved it, so I'll give it 3 stars.  Will try one more time.
