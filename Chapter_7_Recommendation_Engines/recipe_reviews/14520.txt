Very good. The answer to the toughness of the cut is that you need to add an acid.  I added lemon juice, but you could add vinegar--balsamic would be great.  Very nice tasting marinade

I have always been apprehensive about making London Broil due to claims of it being dry and tough after cooking.  Well, an unbeatable price forced me to give this recipe a try and all I can say is "WOW"!  I was short on cooking time, so mine only got to soak in marinade for about an hour and a half, and I broiled it in my oven about 10 minutes per side instead of grilling outdoors.  I did sprinkle the meat with some meat tenderizer before marinating, and let it stand about five minutes after cooking before I sliced it across the grain.  It was tender, juicy, delicious and received rave reviews from my dinner guests.  I'll never be intimidated by this cut of meat again, thank you so much Char!!!!

OK...I changed a few things....4 cloves garlic instead of 3, about ONE FOURTH cup soy sause and ONE FOURTH cup worcestshire, about 5 dashes of McCormick Montreal Steak Grill Mates seasoning mixed with the vegetable oil and black pepper. I LEFT OUT THE KETCHUP AND THE OREGANO!!!!! 
I marinated a London Broil for about 5 hours and MAN OH MAN! IT WAS SSSOOOOOOOOO GREAT!
You have GOT to try it this way!

i made a double batch of this for 3.5 pounds of london broil, and marinated overnight. i substituted worcestershire sauce for half of the soy sauce called for, and added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice to start tenderizing, since i was using a cheap cut of meat. while the meat cooked, i boiled the marinade for about 5-7 minutes, which reduced it to a lovely thick steak sauce. VERY positive reaction from both myself and my husband, and so easy! i love that the ingredients were all things i already had in my pantry or fridge.

Hi, I just wanted to add that there is NO NEED to merinate meat or/& or "score" the meat with a ODD tool- I find it much tastier if you place your meat (in WHATEVER recipe you use, TRUST ME) in a large flat bottom bowl with your merinade mix in bowl with the meat, take JUST 2 forks, and puncture it all the way through to the bottom..ALOT, alternating the forks to make a sponge out of the meat, or using one fork to hold down the meat in a small area and use the free fork to make the punctures and FLIP the meat every so often!! 
I have actually made a whole cup of marinade ABSORB in to 2 lbs of meat in under 20 min!!!! TRY THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!
AS AN ADDED BONUS YOU ARE TENDERIZING IT TOO without using an expensive, odd looking or dangerous gadget!!!
;D

Wow, this was a winner!  This recipe made the best london broil~very easy to do and tasty.  My husband couldn't get enough!  I cooked it on the George Forman grill for about 8 minutes, which cooked it to a perfect medium.

I loved this recipe.  I did marinate the meat for 3 days in a zip-lock bag and kicked it up a bit with some zesty steak sauce, balsamic vinegar and basically a larger amount of the ingredients listed.  I grilled in over a medium flame for about 45 minutes and it was tasty, tender, not mushy and the small amount of leftovers were great on a sandwich.  Will make again!!

Great steak marinade! Since the title uses "London Broil" I decided to use "London Broil" because it was on sale. That's definitely a thicker, tougher cut of meat (it's not flank steak) and needs a longer marinating time, about 48 hours. I used this marinade for 1 & 1/2 pounds of steak. I low sodium soy sauce, olive oil vs. veg., chili sauce vs. ketchup, and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I also cut the amount of pepper in half and added 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go, turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After grilling I cut it against the grain and it was not only tender and juicy, but delicious!

What a fantastic way to prepare an inexpensive cut of meat!  I followed the recipe entirely except for doing 1/4 c. worcestershire sauce and 1/4 c. soy sauce insead of the 1/2 c. soy.  I also marinated the meat for a full 24 hours.  This came out so flavorful and so tender!  I can't believe I paid $1.86 for a steak and loved the taste!

Such a great flavor!  I only marinated the meat for 2 hours, so i'm looking forward to marinating it longer...i'm sure it'll be better.  I cooked it on the stove for about 15 minutes on each side.  I also sauteed green peppers, onions, and mushrooms and added the marinade to simmer.  After slicing the London Broil, I added the sauteed veggies and sauce over the meat and served it with white rice. It was very delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

Culinary experts have proven that marinades are ineffective in tenderizing meats; they really only infuse flavor.  What *does* tenderize meat is salting or brining. Salt denatures proteins, making them unbind and form looser bonds. That's why this marinade works well - because of the soy sauce. The salt in soy sauce acts like a brine, helping the meat retain moisture during cooking and making it more tender. So you definitely don't want to reduce the amount of soy sauce in this recipe, as it is the tenderizing agent. But you also don't need to marinate for as long as eight hours; you will achieve very satisfactory results by marinating for one hour.

Some changes--first I sliced Sirloin Steak into 1/2 inch slices, then marinated for 24 hours.  I sauted mushrooms and onions in butter while I was lightly frying the steak in the marinade for about 10 minutes.  I put mushrooms, onions, steak and marinade and refrigerated overnight, then just reheated the next night for dinner.  We had twice baked potatoes, salad and this steak for our Valentine's Dinner and it was fabulous.  Great marinade!

Delicious marinade! I was really worried that this would be too salty for my taste, but it wasn't at all. I used pork spare ribs with the marinade and they turned out absolutely fantastic. The taste was very similar to the spare ribs you get in a chinese restaurant. I'll definitely use this for many types of meat. Thank you!

Very yummy, I usually just pop in the oven for ~20 minutes at 350 instead of putting it on the grill.

this was pretty successful...my cut took 8 min on each side under the broiler for med rare...I put it back in for some who don't like it quite as rare.  I marinated it for about 20 hours and would next time try and do it for 48 hours like some did.  The flavor was good.

I tried this on Tri Tip but didn't have time to let it sit over night...WOW!!!  This is a "keeper" in our family!  Everytime I try a new recipe I ask the family if it's a keeper or not and it was unanimous!  Also, I ended up broiling it in the oven.

Thanks for posting this recipe, and thanks to everyone who wrote reviews on it...I read every one, as I was having all 12 people over for a dinner recently and wanted everything perfect!  Every person loved the london broil I made according to this recipe and with a few suggestions made by reviewers.  Though I believe the recipe would have been perfect if I'd left it just as it was, I used 50% less sodium soy sauce and added about 2 TBSP's of brown sugar.  (for a double batch)  I handed out your recipe at the door for almost everyone requested it!
Thanks again.

I did make a few changes, and this turned out great.  It does need acid to tenderize the meat, and I chose to use a tablespoon each of lemon juice and rice vinegar.  It just seemed to me that rice vinegar would go better with soy sauce, nothing but personal taste.  I also used lower sodium soy sauce.  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I marinated overnight, and cooked this on the broiler for about 10 minutes per side.  It came out medium rare, tender, and delicious!  I will definitely make London Broil this way again.

So good! Coated with apple cider vinegar before adding marinade to help break down the tough cut. Also used garlic powder because I was in a hurry - don't use garlic salt since the soy is so salty already. Really tasty!!

Turned out perfectly!  Quite delicious!  I scored the meat with a knife (about 1/8") in a criss cross pattern, rather than use a fork.

My boyfriend took one bite of this and said, "We're having THIS again!!"  A huge success, and I didn't even have the time to marinate it longer than 5 hours - it didn't matter one bit! Next time I will let it sit the entire time.

This is a great marinade!  The only change I make is that I use 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce.  I also add a tablespoon or so of balsalmic vinegar.  I keep everything else the same.  It's definitely a keeper!

I think insofar as the marinade flavors go, this was very tasty and well balanced--I didn't get the overwhelming soy flavor other reviewers have complained about. I found the garlic, oregano, and soy flavors to be gorgeously blended. I do, however, think that with this cut of meat it's crucial to add an acid to tenderize. To this recipe I added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and the juice of 1/2 a lemon (and a tablespoon of worcestershire just for the fun of it). It was fantastic--or, I should say, the center slices that were less cooked were fantastic: be sure to make this as rare as you can comfortably make it, because the more cooked ends were rather tough.

This marinade is VERY GOOD.  I marinated my meat for 3 days and than had to broil it because I don't have a grill right now.  It came out great.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks!!

Wow was this ever good!  Don't know why others came out tough unless they cooked it till it was "well done".  Mine came out totally tender, it melted in our mouths!!!  Oh, we are going to be making this again SOON!

If we could rate it more than 5 we would.  The kids wanted seconds and said this was the best.  Made with London Broil and vacuum sealed for a half hour.  Followed the directins to a "T".  Delicious....Thanks Char

This was soooooo good.  Best marinade I ever had.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil but I'm sure it's good either way. I also basted the meat with the marinade when I was grilling it.

This has got to be the BEST London Broil I've ever made.  Absolutely delicious.  I did squeeze the juice of one lemon and added it to the marinade to help tenderize the meat.  Also, I let it marinate about 36 hours, then removed from the fridge to come to room temperature before placing on the grill.  I've learned room temperature beef will cook up more tender because the cold meat will "shrink" when the heat hits it.  I like my beef pretty well done, and hubby likes it medium.  So I grilled on high about 7 minutes per side on high heat, and the ends were perfect for me with the center being nice and pink for him.  It was perfect.  Thanks for this one!!!

Fantastic flavor and so very easy to make.  I had never made London Broil before.  After trying this recipe, london broil will become a staple in our house.  My husband couldn't get enough.  I have to admit, I did take the advice of others and cut the soy sauce in half and substituted worcestershire sauce for that half. You won't be disappointed.

Very good. I took the advice of others and added 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar (a good one), onion powder, and garlic powder to the marinade. Only had 6 hours for it to marinade and didn't grill it - cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes (we like ours medium) and it was delicious. Very tender and flavorful. I will make this again, but next time I'll marinate it overnight.

Today was the very first time I have ever tried to make London Broil and what a great recipe this is!  Easy to make and the marinade absolutely penetrated the meat.  I had a 1.25 lb. piece of meat which I scored on both sides before marinating.  I put all of the marinade ingredients directly into a Ziploc bag and then added the meat and marinated the meat all day.  I followed the suggestion of adding the balsamic vinegar and added 1 T. Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp. rosemary.  I grilled the meat in my Cuisinart Griddler for 9 minutes total and let sit for 10 minutes before slicing.  Rare in the middle, tender, and juicy.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty, my family enjoyed it, and very easy to prepare and grill.  I added about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar to aide in tenderizing the meat and flavor.  I found that I needed to grill the steak 10-14 minutes per side in order to have it done, still pink inside.

Very good, if you follow the few changes other reviewers suggested like I did.  First, I did 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup wochestersire sauce to cut the sodium.  I vaccuum sealed it & let it maranade overnight.  Then, instead of grilling, I broiled it.  With this cut of meat, you have to be careful not to over cook it or it will not be tender.  This was a great recipe and I am glad I didn't use as much soy sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  I have never had such a flavorful and tender London Broil!  My fiancee was VERY pleased as well!  I didn't have soy sauce on hand so I used worcestershire sauce and a dab of teryaki sauce.  In addition to ketchup, I also added 2 tbsp KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  Whatever you do, poke lots of holes with a fork (front and back) and marinate overnight... oh, the flavors!

I absolutely love the recipe for the marinade, it is delicious and flavorful.  I don't use the cooking method(I don't have a grill), but the marinade is definitely worth 5+ stars.

Very pleased with marinade recipe and will definitely make this recipe again. The only changes that I made was; only ¼ teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon Mrs Dash seasoning, was out of oregano, only ¼ cup soy sauce and added 2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar as the last reviewer suggested. Also, marinated London broil in a glass pie plate and flipped the steak over every once in awhile.

Only marinated for half an hour and left out the ketchup but it was a great flavor. The cooking time was spot on. Next time I will definitely marinate longer, wowow I bet it will be much juicier.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I couldn't cook it right away so it marinated about 2 days and it was fine. Now I can have a great dish with an inexpensive piece of meat. What a joy!!

My family loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly until cooking. I had to use the slow cooker because of a schedule change, and I was really concerned about how it would turn out. It was much better than I expected, and the flavor was wonderful. Not rare, of course, but tender and moist. We all enjoyed it, and I hope that next time I can grill it.

This was an impressive recipe.  Better than I could have imagined.  I used Lite Soy Sauce and added maybe a tablespoon of Worcester Sauce because I was short on the soy.  I also added just a bit of garlic salt.  I marinated overnight.  Excellent recipe!  I will definitely use again.

I have used MANY recipies on this site and this is one of my all time favs!!!  The only thing I change is that I add about a tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the marinade.  And you really should marinade it all day, it makes a world of difference!!!

Very tasty. I thought about making this about 3:30 one afternoon so didn't have the time to marinate it overnight. I'm sure that'd make it even better, but since I didn't have the time, I sprinkled the meat with about 2 tablespoons of meat tenderizer and popped it along with the marinade (adding a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar) into a ziploc bag for about 3 hours. We ran out of propane, so cooked it in the grill pan on the stove, basting it with the marinade. Loved it.

Some people making this may be slicing the meat "with the grain".  You should slice "against" the grain.  If you see long strands of meat when you slice it, flip it over!  Slice it at an angle.

Marinated London Broil over night in 1 gallon ziplock bag. Cooked 10min each side with the broiler in the oven. Smoked up the house, but this was deeeeeeelicous!! Also added 3 tbsp of lemon juice to marinade and used 3 tsp of garlic powder instead of minced garlic. YUM!

Not bad! My husband had been asking for london broil for years and I stumbled across this recipe so thought I'd try it. Somehow I found a huge piece of steak labeled london broil at the grocery store for only $8. I followed this recipe but instead of garlic cloves I used a teaspoon of garlic salt.
I wasn't quite sure about grilling the meat so I also followed someone else's suggestion of broiling on high for 10 mins each side. Next time I probably just won't broil it as long to get it more tender and pink inside. Otherwise this was great and cheap!!

I thought this was just delicious!  We all had second helpings, and that's next to a miracle in this family...Did have to cook it a little longer, but I think that was our grills fault.  Great recipe!

Great flavor.  Because of the cut of the meat, my second try was cooked in the slow cooker.... made it tender and delicious.  My hubby is loving the left overs on sweet rolls.

I have now cooked the meat two different ways - on the Foreman and in the crockpot. I added the meat and marinade to gallon freezer bags and had them both in the freezer for later use. I thawed each overnight in the fridge prior to cooking. They were both terrific, but I must say the marinade lent great flavor to the veggies in the crock and I will definitely repeat! I dumped the whole bag in a burner safe crock and browned the meat for a few minutes on each side, allowing the sauce to thicken a bit at the same time. I then moved the crock to the crockpot, added potatoes, carrots and green beans then cooked on low for 6 hours. The one difference to the ingredients used is that my soy sauce is Hot Honey Soy. The little bit of zip from the spice was tasty, even for the 12-13 yr old boys in the house! Great way to make a good meal from a less costly cut of meat!

Good marinade! We marinaded our meat for 2 days before eating it.. added balsamic vinegar and the meat was still slightly chewy/tough. The cut of meat you get makes a big difference but at least the marinade tasted good!

This is absolutely delicious, when marinated for 24 hours. I use a spiked meat tenderizer on the meat before putting it in the marinade. OMG, absolutely my favorite way to have London Broil.

Great marinade. I followed suggestions from reviewers, added 2 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup each of soy sauce and worcestshire sauce. Previously cooking London Broil I would have leftovers. NOT ANY MORE. This recipe is fantastic.  Thanks for posting.

Great marinade-- Just a few changes...  1/4 c. Teriyaki sauce instead of soy (it's what I had available), 1/4 c. worst. sauce, Asian 5 spice, sesame oil for veg. oil, and a splash of rice wine vinegar made it a bit more of an Asian marinade, maybe...   I marinated it for 8 hrs. and broiled in in the oven vs. on the grill.  Thicker cut, so it needed more time, about 12-15 min. per side.  Easy, tasty way to make a London Broil...  Thanks!!

I marinated the steak for two days (48 hours) seared it on the BBQ than slow cooked with indirect heat and it was so good!! I think the trick with London Broil is to marinate it a minimum of 24 hours and possibly 48 hours it helps to tenderize the typical tough cut of meat.  My husband has challenged me to cut our food budget by some 40% and catching this meat on sale sure helps!

I have never made a "london broil" before, and was really worried that it would not turn out right, and it would be another night of carryout!  However, I have to say that this was the best tasting, most tender beef that I have ever cooked. My husband, who dislikes steak and always puts sauce on everything before he even tries it, absolutely loved it...he did not even try to put A1 on it!  I did change the recipe a little.  I only put in 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and replaced the other 1/4 cup with balsamic vinegar (per another review's suggestion).  I also sprinkled meat tenderizor on it before I marinated it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and it was fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe...will definitely make again :)

I used previous suggestion and added Balsamic Vinegar (about 1/4 cup) and used Oyster Sauce instead of Soy Sauce- which makes the marinade thicker and allows it to really adhere to the meat surface. (Don't spend $4 on Oyster Sauce at the grocery store, you can get it at the Dollar Store). Truly delicious marinade-

Maybe I shouldn't rate this because I made some bigger changes, but it was AWESOME so I will. Used 1/2 cup soy, 1/2 cup worcesteshire, MORE garlic, olive oil, 1/4 cup ketchup, balsamic (maybe 1/4 cup or less) because tough meat needs the acid, and used round steak (which I despise using). Cut the meat into 4 large pieces, put into a ziplock freezer bag, added the  marinade and left it sit in the refrigerator for 48 full hours. UNBELIEVBABLE! My husband still can't believe that was round steak! My oldest daughter ate it plus the leftovers in a salad the next day, and she doesn't like steak. It was amazingly good and had so much flavor! REMEMBER: Slice it very thin! I grilled for about 5 minutes on each side to a perfect medium rare and sliced thinly. Amazing!

This was so good!   I made the recipe as is, but, instead of using all soy sauce I used half soy sauce and half worcestire sauce.  I also left out the oregano.  I had a 4 lb london broil, so, I actually doubled the marinade.  It completely covered the roast so the marinade really soaked in.  It took about 6-7 minutes per side on the grill. It was perfectly cooked and more tasty than I thought a london broil could be and because you slice it so thin - it feeds a crowd!  My husband and I actually preferred it cold the next day.  We ate it on a "steak" salad, but, it would be fantastic in a sandwich or a wrap.  Definitely will be making this again.

Beyond amazing! The only thing I did different was I used 4 cloves of garlic, because we loooove garlic. And my boyfriend DETESTS ketchup, so I used 2tbs Worchestershire sauce instead. This recipe is beyond amazing, and is now a favorite of mine and my boyfriends!

This was wonderful! I've made it twice in 2 weeks the whole family's loved it so. This last time I doubled the marinade for a 2.5 lb london broil.   The only changes to the marinade I made was substituting a mixture of worchestershire sauce, san-j meat marinade and balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce.  I only marinaded it for 1.5 hrs., then seared the meat on both sides, poured in the marinade and 2 cups of water, covered it and cooked on med-hi heat for about 5-7 mins a side (had to watch the marinade and mix it a bit.)  Then I removed the meat, added about 2-3 cups more of water and 2 packets of low-sodium mc cormicks brown gravy to the marinade in the pan to make the most wonderful gravy to pour over the tender, moist meat!!  This recipe is now in the regular rotation, thank you sooo much for posting!!

I doubled the recipe for a large London Broil and used the suggestions of 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 worcestershire sauce, and marinated for a couple of hours as we were in a hurry.  Also added mushrooms, peppers and garlic to the marinade and sauted and reduced to a wonderful gravy to pour over the London Broil after it was sliced in 1/4 inch sliced.  We absolutely loved this recipe!! Will use it many more times I'm certain.

So flavorful.  I did not add the oregano.  I could only marinate it for 1 hour but I pierced the sliced meat repeatedly.  I cooked these quickly in a skillet.  Everyone loved this moist, tender meat.

I use this now every ttime I cook a London broil.  I like to cook it in the oven with the broiler.  I love the flavor and usually marinate it over night.  I did make a change or two.  I added lemon juice to help tenderize the meat and I added worcestershire sauce. I do double the recipe though so there is plenty of sauce for the meat to sit in.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic marinade.  I couldn't get over how flavorful the meat turned out.  I let the meat marinade for about 8 hours.  I used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce. I also used EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I grilled for about 10 minutes on both sides.  If it hadn't been burned on the outside it would have been perfect!

This London Broil recipe is  outstanding !!!  I printed off  a copy of this recipe back in November of 2002.  The page is stained up with lots of use.  I need to print off a new copy :)  I told my Mother-in-law about this great recipe and she wants a copy too.  So I just sent her one via ecard.  Print your copy today.  You will very happy that you did.

We have used this recipe  many times for our Sunday after Church dinner.  My Dear Love cooks it on the grill while I cook the extras.  He loves being a part and it saves me time in the kitchen.  If we have any leftovers we eat it up as Sandwiches  on nice hearty rolls.  Its great for After Sunday night Church.  An easy and tasty meal.  Enjoy !!!

Fantastic!  I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was perfect.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I'll use the leftovers for sandwiches, maybe Philly Cheese or French Dip.

This was pretty good, and all the ingredients were on hand at home, which is a big bonus.  I wouldn't call it the best London Broil marinade I've ever had though - I still find a bottle of russian dressing and some montreal steak seasoning to be the best option.

Sauce was a little on the salty side for our tastes, but will make again, and next timew ill either use low-sodium soy sauce or cut it back to 1/4 c and substitute rice vinegar or some other liquid.  The mixture does a good job of tenderizing the meat, though.  Even my very picky son actually ate some of the meat, so it is definitely a keeper recipie.

This was a great marinade. It smelled great cooking. It made the meat tender and juicy,  I did add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. My husband really loved it as did I. We will make this again and again!

I marinated overnight and the steak was VERY tender and good.  I used the George Foreman grill to make the meat.

While the meat was tender, I personally found the flavor of this marinade just "so-so" for a London Broil. Hubby says don't make this one again. Thanks, anyway.

OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic.  I marinated the meat for 3 days, which I am sure helped make it very tender and juicy.

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  I've made this for my whole neighborhood and they can't believe it's cheap meat!  Plus, I used the marinade for jerky and that was AWESOME too!  You can't go wrong with this at all, even my picky husband loved it!

This made fantastic grilled sandwiches.  I marinated it for two days, adding a little Worcheshire sauce to the marinade. Grilled over indirect medium heat for 40 minutes and came out perfect.  Do find a Choice grade flank steak, the extra marbling helps keep the steak tender.

This is an excellent marinade.  I used low sodium soy the second time I made it.  Regular soy is too salty.  This has become a family favorite

This recipe was SO easy, and the house smelled great all day!  I used it as a marinade in a crockpot, doubled it so there would be enough to cover the meat - next time the only thing I will change is to use low-sodium soy sauce.  Can also boil the "drippings" to make gravy.

first time i made this it was only 3 stars, way too salty(marinated for 36 hours) and overcooked. Made it again and only let it marinade for 2 hours, first rubbing it down with a little red wine vinegar to break the meat down; then cooked it 6 minutes a side. It was absolutely awesome this time

This is amazing!  I was a little wary of the amount of soy sauce, but the cooked meat is absolutely delicious and not too salty.  This is my new favorite way to prepare London Broil.  Thanks, Char!

This was a great recipe.  Turned out great.  I used about 1/3 cup soy sauce and it was plenty.  1/2 cup is not necessary.  Also, since I used my george foreman grill, I used just a dash of liquid smoke and it gave a great outdoor grilled flavor.  Also, you should let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting into it, very essential.

This recipe was good. The best part was it was very simple. My boyfriend and I use the George Forman grill often in the winter to cook meat. And I think it might have taken away some of the flavor. We will being trying it again in the summer. I highly recommend more garlic (we love garlic and double the amount and still needed more). And overall the soy sauce taste was too stong, it kind of over powered the steak. But we would use this recipe again with a few minor alterations.

I made some changes to this recipe based on what I had on hand at home, and it was mouth-watering good.  I've used this marinade on a tri-tip also and it was outstanding.  Here's the changes I made:

1/2 cup teriyaki sauce INSTEAD of soy sauce
2 tbsp olive oil INSTEAD of vegetable oil
2 tbsp hot sauce (I used siriacha/chinese)    instead of ketchup
dash of salt.

otherwise everything is the same.

It's good enough to eat right off the grill or broiler--even cooked medium the way I like it it is extremely tender.  To die for!!

I must admit, I took many liberties with this recipe, so the outcome is probably very different, but I did use this as a base.  To start with, I increased the amount to the point that I could cover the meat and cooked it for ten hours in my crockpot rather than on the grill.  Also, I substituted worcestershire for the soy sauce, and added a liberal splash of barbeque sauce and two tablespoons of sugar.  I served it with the sauce smothered over the top and it was very good.  The meat was very tender and broke away with a fork.  I'll try this again!!

We broiled our london broil instead of grilling, which worked great!  I had two steaks weighing a total of about 3 1/2 pounds, so I used 1 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup Worchestershire sauce, added 5 (LARGE!) cloves of minced garlic, and added 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder (I think I could have added more, maybe 1 full tsp.), added one more tablespoon ketchup, and marinated in an oven bag for about 8 hours.  The oven bag made it easy to flip the meat, and it was an easy cleanup with no dirty bowls..just threw the oven bag away.  The meat was flavorful and juicy..it didn't need any extra sauces or flavorings.  I made a gravy out of the drippings...OUTSTANDING!

Awesome marinade. Only had about 90 minutes to marinade it, but it made a big difference in taste and texture. Made sure to cook it rare.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a splash of lemon juice per other reviewers' suggestions.  I marinated a thick piece of London Broil 24 hours then grilled it.  It was delicious!

I prepared the marinade this morning and let the meat soak in it all day in the refrigerator.  We grilled it at a medium temperature on our gas grill for about 7 minutes on both sides.  It was FABULOUS!  We will definitely make it again.

Great and easy marinade, my kids gobbled the steak up and said it was really good. I only marinated the steak for 4 hours and it was still delicious! Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I used this marinade on a 1.6 pound top round steak. I marinated the for 24 hours, then my husband grilled the steak to medium rare. Very nice.

I am horrible at grilling and usually eat my meat well done where my husband likes his medium rare. After reading the comments on this I thought I would give it a try for our 20th Anniversary dinner. Let me say, it was perfect. I followed the recipe to a T and was thrilled that I actually like medium rare london broil. The marinade was so good and I only had an hour to let it sit. Can't wait to use this and let it sit over night. It was cooked to perfection. Thanks for the great recipe and turning my husband back onto london broil.

Thanks previous reviewers,  I used 1/4 soy sauce and 1/4 Worcestershire, added extra garlic and two tablespoons of brown sugar, reduced the sauce and poured over and loved it.  The flavor was incredible.  2 days in a ziplock bag did the trick.  We love spicy so I added two, ok three dashes of cayenne pepper for some kick.  Will be making this with flank steak soon.  I do think the meat was a little chewy, not tough so I may try vinegar nx time.

Best beef marinade I've used.  I put the meat in a cooking dish to marinate, then popped it on the cool side of the grill with a foil covering. Midway through, I put the meat on the hot side for a good sear on both sides, them back onto the cool side in foil until it was done. Since the marinade was now "cooked", I used it as a sauce for the meat. Combined with the dripping from the foil it was very tasty.

Very good recipe!  I marinated the london broil in a plastic bag overnight and then cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours...I added some whole baby mushrooms, onions, carrots, yellow, red and orange peppers (I wanted to add potatoes but I didn't have any).  I put it in the slow cooker because my grill is covered in snow right now =).  I can't wait to try it in the summer!  It gave the veggies great flavor.  I think 6 hours on low was a tad bit too long, but it was still good anyway =)

Added 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to marinade. Very tender! This is the first time I have cooked a london broil and had it come out tender. It was also delicious but a little salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce. Next time I will try to cut down the soy sauce by half and see how it goes.

Already having all the ingredients in the kitchen I couldn't resist trying this recipe.  Boy am I glad I did! My family loved the flavor! I tend to cook on the bland side but this recipe sure had the zing my husband and sons were looking for.  I did marinate, using a ziplock bag, for 6 hours in the fridge and boiled  the left over marinade(as suggested by others) to use as a gravy.  That was probably the best part for my guys!!  Delish!  This is definately a keeper!!!!

i made this exactly as it says but doubled it for more steaks.  The flavor was fantastic and the steaks were so tender.  I marinated it for 24 hours.  I have also used steak sauce on all my steaks in the past but not this time.  And it was good cold on a salad the next day.

A very worthy recipe - nice, nice flavor.  We also boiled our marinade to use as a juice - yum!!  Parts of the meat were still chewy, but I'm assuming it was the cut of beef since some was good.  Either way, the flavor was very nice.  I didn't have all the ketchup it called for by added some worceshire (?)

Thank you Char for sharing your lovely recipe for London Broil.  But, I also have to thank TCCBABY for sharing her version of this recipe too.  With the addition of 1/4 worcestshire sauce, 1 more garlic clove & only using 1/4 cup of soy sauce.  The sauce was to die for (I must mention that I did not omit the ketchup & oregano) my husband loved, loved, loved the sauce.  Thanks ladies for sharing and it  made my day to see how much my husband enjoyed his dinner!!

Used half soy half balsamic.  I first did  a salt crust  a la steamykitchen to aid in tenderizing and whacked the heck out of it as well with my  tenderizer gadget.  Not sure how much difference it made but twas good all the same.  I added some red wine to the leftover bit of marinade and reduced to a delicious drizzle.    Just had the leftovers as a steak salad wrap with blue cheese crumbles and the balsamic wine drizzle.  Yum.

Here's a novel idea....follow this recipe exactly as is and let the meat stand for 8-10 minutes before slicing!  That's what I've been doing for the last 2 years, and it is not only a family favorite, but it's a hit at cookouts.

This is a great marinade!  Made minor changes, used 4 clove of garlic instead of 3 and added 1/4 cup white vinegar to tenderize meat. Also used a meat mallet to break meat down a little before marinade was added. I only had 5 hours to let it marinate, and it still came out MAGNIFICENT.  Broiled about 5 minutes on each side. Thanks so much for sharing, b/c I usually have a hard time with marinades!

DELICIOUS.  I rubbed kosher salt into the meat before marinating it, and followed others' suggestions to use worchestershire sauce for half of the soy sauce. Followed the rest of the directions exactly. DELICIOUS. Did I say how delicious this was?!

I made this steak for company. I always try recipes as written especially the first time I make them in order to be fair to the person that posted it on this website. I used more garlic cloves than indicated only because my family likes garlic and it's good for you. My father has to be the pickiest person when it comes to trying new foods, he had no clue that there was ketchup in the marinade. It was awesome! This recipe is a keeper.

Nice and tender. I was looking for a recipe at the last minute so I could only marinate 4 hours. I forgot oregano-didn't have soy so I added a little worcestershire sauce and steak sauce and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Sauteed onions and mushrooms, pan-seared and put oven-proof skillet (with lid) in oven at 350 for 25 min.

I am definitely keeping this in my "favorite recipes" book. I did add some lemon juice and omitted the ketchup though. The meat was so flavorful and even our non-beef lover enjoyed it and said she would eat it again. Thank you so much for this great recipe.

I haven't made a London Broil before, so I wasn't sure what to do with it.  I came across this recipe and had all the ingredients on hand so I thought I'd try it. The flavor was great, but a little salty. I used the leftover meat for steak caesar pitas(awesome!).  I will definantly use this marinade again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was I basted with barbeque sauce mixed with honey to give it a beautiful color.  Served with red potoates....Delish!!!

Came out really good. Used some teriyaki sauce as well. Cooked it in the oven about 8-10 minutes broiled on each side.

Wonderful. I went with the half soy/half Worcestershire sauce variation and used lots of chopped bottled garlic. My picky 9 year old liked it, my 13 year old liked it, my garlic loving husband loved it, and so did I. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! I've always stayed away from london broil because of its toughness and quality but this recipe changed all of that. I made it last night and it was terrific!!! I did change a few thing that were suggested by comments. I added balsamic vinegar, worcestershire sauce and less soy sauce. I also left out the ketchup since it didn't great but the final outcome was great. Thanks for posting the recipe and I'll pass this along to my family and friends.

Done changes similar to others here.  1/4 cup Soy, 1/8+ cup Worchester, 1/8 cup lemon pepper marinade.  Used a caribean marinade or caribbean style steak sauce instead of ketchup.  Reduced remaining marinade for a nice little sauce.  Outstanding once I got the cook time down!  The cuts I've used have been fairly thick, usually 8-10 on a side gets me a nice well done crust with the rare middle.

This is a great recipe!  London Broil is inexpensive and quick.  Great under the broiler too if you don't have a grill.  I've made it so many times that I can just "guesstimate" the measurements now.  Just make sure that you marinate for at least 8 hours so that it will be nice and tender!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I marinated it for almost 24 hours and even though this is a cheap cut of meat, it was very tender.  The only thing that I would do differently is use low-sodium soy sauce.  Soy sauce tends to make food salty and overpowers the other flavors.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very easy and delicous marinade.  I only used half the soy sauce and used W sauce too.  It was delicous.  My 3 y/o and 15 m/o couldn't get enough.  Tender enough for the baby.

this was delicious.  I cooked it in my convection oven and it turned out moist, juicy and tender.  Even my 8 year old asked for seconds and she doesn't like a lot of meat!  Thanks for sharing.  Mmm Mmm!

This was my first time at cooking a london broil.  The recipe was spot on.  I did, however, make a few personal changes.  Worcestershire was used in place of Soy Sauce, the wife is not a big fan of soy sauce. I also added 2 tsp of Italian seasoning along with 1 tsp of McCormick's Season-All. The last change was EVO2 instead of Canola. This seems like a lot of changes, but the basic recipe was used as a guideline.  I did go overnight with the marinade for maximum flavor.

HOW TO SALVAGE YOUR ROAST IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT OR IT IS TOUGH:  Ok so we had the same problem with this recipe that others did, meat had an odd flavor, not bad, just odd and it came out tough.  BUT we were able to turn it into a delightful sandwich roast.  We took the already cooked roast and put it in a pot of boiling water for about 4 hours (or until desired tenderness) then we refrigerated it and it was delicious as a cold sandwich meat.  It even tasted better warm after coming out of the water.  It was actually SO GOOD that I think I will make it again the exact same way.  Delicous nitrate free "deli" meat.

This is awesome--overnight marinade a little strong--8 hrs. about right. I like to also add two tablespoons of Ken's  Red Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil Dressing and cut back just a smidghe on the Soy Sauce---Fantastic Au-Jus

Great flavor, but a bit too salty, and didn't tenderize as much as I hoped it would, even after fork-piercing it to near ribbons and marinating overnight. Next time I plan to use low sodium soy sauce, and add either lemon or vinegar to help tenderize the meat. On the plus side, the leftovers continued to improve in flavor the longer they sat in the fridge!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I don't change a thing except for maybe the vinegar, which depends on what I have on hand.  My father-in-law (who's a bit against strong flavors) had SECONDS!  I couldn't believe it!  This is a keeper that we use over and over!

This is a pretty good marinade for a tougher cut of meat. I made the mistake of following other reviews & adding balsamic vinegar. It just wasn't right for our tastes. Next time I would skip it. Thanks for sharing!

This Marinade was INCREDABLE. Instead of using all Soy Sauce I used 1/4 C Wishtochire Sauce and 1/4 C Soy Sauce. Instead of Ketsup I used original Flavor BBQ sauce for extra flavore I didnt have fresh garlic so I used garlic Powder and I only had italian seasoning so I used that. I didnt have time to marinate it overnight so I used my flavor Injector and Injected my Roasts with it and it was sooooooooooo good.... Dont be afraid to play with the recipies to make them your own.

This was a declicious marinade.  It was my first time making london broil and I only marinated it for about 2 hours and it still turned out great.  Thanks for a new addition to my recipe box!

Very delicious.  My 16 mos toddler who hasn't liked red meat yet even took a few bites.  I only had 6 hrs available to marinade, and it still came out great.  Definitely serve medium rare to medium, as it keeps the marinade flavor better.

What a fabulous way to turn an inexpensive cut of beef into a mouth-watering and succulent steak.  Thumbs up to the perfect blend of spices and ingredients.  Thanks!

I decided to make this b/c of the raving ratings and reviews. I marinated it overnight (with only 1/3 cup soy sauce) and cooked it on a frying pan. The aroma was great, and the meat tender and juicy, but I would've gone with low-sodium soy sauce or just less soy sauce. Can't really taste the oregano or the ketchup though. Overall, I'm a little bit disappointed, but would certainly try again with modifications.

This was excellent! I had never made London Broil before... I had eaten it and thought it was "ok" but had an opportunity to bogo (buy one get one free) at the store so thought I would give it a try myself.  Anyway, the recipe is easy and flavor and tenderness of the finished product was 5 star in my book.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful marinade. Wow! I marinaded two London Broil steaks for over 24 hours and the meat is tender and juicy. Delicious! I did add 1 tsp seasoned pepper (Montreal Steakhouse, made by McCormick)and reduced the oregano by 1/2. 
Thanks!

This recipe is just plain awesome!  I had my doubts at first with the ketchup and veg oil, gave it a try anyhows.  It was super juicy!  My mother in law said it was the best steak she had ever eaten and my husband said that it was so juicy it "watered his mouth".  Only thing that I did different was add a little bit more garlic cause we love garlic in my house!  Definatly gonna make it again!

I made this in my oven using the broiler.  Started on the second slot down (for shelf) and the broiler on HI.  Watch it carefully so you don't burn it.  Used about 6 minutes on each side.  Came out great.

Soy sauce was a little strong for my family's taste.  Next time I'll reduce that a little and add onion salt.  I might also try this marinade on a more tender cut of meat.

Very easy, quick and delicious. Time was limited, so I marinated the same day in a heavy bag, I kept kneeding the london broil/marinade in the bag to work in the flavor. On the grill within 1 hours, tasted great. A keeper.

This marinade was fantastic.  The london broil was juicy and so flavorful.  I threw all the ingredients in a resealable bag, shook it up to mix, added the meat, and marinated it for almost 2 days!  Holy Moly it was good.  Thank you!

The marinade was a bit to over powering when eating just the meat as a meal - in fact there was a lot leftover. However I would rate this higher if you use it for fajita meat as we did.  The meat was a nice flavor with the grilled veggies and fajita fixins.

Very good. I doubled the ketchup and only marinated it for 4 hours and it was still good. I can't wait to try again and marinate with the proper time. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! My son always uses bbq sauce, sweet & sour sauce or steak sauce on EVERY piece of meat that he eats, on this one, he only used the juice from the meat as the "sauce". I also used the leftover marinade as seasoning to cook some fried potatoes and onions, and it was wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

This is so fabulous I had to pass along the recipe to the girls at work and they all agree it's the best marinade they've ever had. My Mom, who isn't a big beef eater, couldn't get enough! Thanks so much for posting a terrific recipe. (I do substitute 12 low-salt soy sauce  12 worcestshire to cut down on the salt)

This was a good marinade and it smelled fabulous. I'd like to try it on a different cut of meat, however, as I'm not a big fan of this particular cut.

I was extrememly impressed with this marinade. I used top round and overcooked the meat, however, it still wasn't bad. I poured the extra marinade over so the meat didn't taste as dry. I will definitely use again, hopefully I won't overcook the meat!

I used 1/2 a tsp of ground black pepper & substituted 1 tsp onion powder for the oregano. The ingredients are almost the same as London Broil II which also adds salt.  This version has more liquid.

I thought this was great...the marinade was so flavorful and did a great job tenderizing a real tough peice of meat (I used a 2.5 lb. shoulder steak that was on sale, I normally use top round).
I marinated it for a full 24 hours.  The bad news is, my husband prefers the usual store bought commercially prepared teriyaki-style marinade! Next time (and there WILL be a next time!)...I will use a better cut of meat (the shoulder steak was a little fatty), maybe that will bring him around!

It was a nice change. I only marinade for one day and only had ground oregano so i used half the amount because i thought it would be to strong. Im glad i did that. The oregano really came out. Next time i will try it with the right stuff and marinade it longer to see if it tastes any different.

I used a real London Broil cut, and followed directions but my husband said the meat was too tough.  He liked the marinade and said it was awesome.  I sliced the meat very thinly and on an angle.  I used the leftover meat the next day to make a quick beef stroganoff for my daughter and her friend. They liked that but didn't ask for seconds. I probably won't make this again.

This is a great recipe! I mixed the marinade in a gallon size baggie, then placed my frozen London Broil in it and placed it in the ice chest, and took it camping. It was very, very tasty! I'll be using this marinade recipe again!

Excellent flavor.  I love the flavor of flank steak but sometimes it can be a  tough cut of meat.  Make sure you score the meat on both sides prior to marinading.  Also I added 2Tbs of Balsamic vinegar, sliced instead of minced the garlic, added sliced ginger and 2Tbs of teriayki.  Delicious, will make again and again

I made this recipe for my family and everyone raved.  I couldn't find plum jam so I substitued black cherry.   It was really delicious!!  I would recommend it highly and would be great for company.  I also tried making it again with London Broil. Definately a keeper, I would marinate the beef the entire 24 hours.

Absolutely delicious marinade!  We used petite sirloin and I marinated approximately 8 hours, but the meat was very tender and juicy.  We'll be using this marinade again!

This was oh, so tender!  Hubby said he prefers this to a sirloin steak!  I have a tenderizing device that I used before I put it into the marinade for 6 hours in the fridge.  Only difference in marinade was I substituted fresh garlic for garlic powder.  After marinading, I brought it to room temp and then grilled it on my Webber grill ... 10 minutes direct, flipped it and then 10 minutes indirect.  My London Broil was almost 3” thick.  I have an instant read thermometer and I took the meat off at 127 degrees and let it continue cooking while it rested. We like our beef cuts more rare and this was PERFECT.  See photo. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

I had a 3 lb roast, I used extra garlic (as usual for me), didn’t have the full time to let it soak in the marinade, and roasted in the oven.  Still turned out very good.
425 for 15 min and finished had 350 until temp was right.
Will do this again hopefully with more time for the marinade to work.
Also the juices loaded up with lots of carmelized onion made a good sauce to use with it.

This recipe is really good.  I don't use the oregano because I prefer it that way.  We use this recipe whenever London broil is on sale.  You can cut really thin slices with an electric carving knife.  Everyone loves it!

After I read all the reviews I tweaked this a little.  Used olive oil instead of regular, cut back on the soy sauce to 1/3 cup and added 3 Tbsp of worchestershire sauce, and 3 slices of fresh lemon.  Only marinated for 2 hours but did pierce meat with a meat fork every time I turned it.  In the words of my son, this is the best London broil you've ever made. Thanks will do it again.

Great recipe. To add an acid to help tenderize this very lean cut of beef, I added 1 tablespoon each of: red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar,  and worcestershire sauce, also added 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme. Even the marinade smells great! Next time I'll add about 2 tablespoon of lemon juice. Marinaded in gallon ziplock bag overnight. Cooked over low-medium covered grill, and careful to not overcook. Reapplied marinade on first flip on grill. Goes great with rice or potatoes and broccoli, asparagus, or any grilled veggies. Simple, easy, savory, and delicious. Only 4 stars because as written the recipe lacks the acid which is really needed for this cut.

I did poke all over with a fork and marinated from 9 to 5.  But something was lacking; next time I want to try adding lemon to tenderize and adding Worchester for more flavor.

So, as I was making the marinade, I'm thinking to myself 'this doesn't seem like there's anything that spectacular in it'....please believe me when I say that it was spectacular!  All those basic ingredients combine to make an amazing piece of beef.  4 of my 5 kids say it's a 'make again' and the ones that have moved out, have already asked for the recipe.

This is a great recipe and I've made it several times. It's a good combination of ingredients. I back off on the soy sauce a bit  because I like to wrap it in foil to make it ready for the grill and the extra soy sauce makes it too soupy for just a 2 lb pc of meat.  Otherwise it's great and I always get compliments.

It was awesome! I did add 4 Tbs of red wine vinegar for tenderizing. Mixed all measured ingredients in a bag, shook it vigorously (no extra bowls to clean!) used the Top Round London Broil after I pieced it to provide saturation of the marinade.'

I followed the recipe as directed and it was fantastic! I only marinaded it for about 6 hrs, then grilled it outside on low for about 15 min. I let it rest 5 minutes and sliced it thin. We will definitely make this again as we love London Broil!

I overcooked it by about 2-3 min. And still came out great. Better to rake it off the grill early than too late. I'm making it this week again; I have to fine-tune it.

Wow! This was fantastic. I took the advice of some others and added Worcester Sauce and cut down on the soy sauce a bit. I also added just a few drops of liquid smoke. Let it marinade for 24 hours. Grilled it 7 minutes per side. Turned out tender, juicy an delicious. Served the meat over a salad of romaine, thin sweet onion slices, tomato and sliced strawberries. Topped with a strawberry vinaigrette.  My wife said she would keep me another week!!!

I can't cook red meat very well, just ask my husband he will back me up on this.  HOWEVER, I followed the directions for this recipe only  substituting fresh oregano for dried because I had it  growing in a pot on the deck.  The london broil turned out tender and juicey ( did I mention a cut of beef that I made turned out tender?1?!).  I had a few pieces left over and was thinking about how to use them as leftovers.  Well the husband has other plans and afe them as he was "helping' me clean up the kitchen"  .  LOL.  THANKS!! 5 stars from the both of us.

This was tasty. I used the recipe as stated except as reviewers suggested, I substituted half the soy sauce with Worcestershire and I added 1 T. Lemon juice to the marinade.  I poked holes with a fork in both sides of the steak then marinated for 48 hours turning and madsaging periodically. I cooked my 1.5 lb London Broil steak for 8 minutes per side in the oven broiler then let it rest for 5 minutes.  It was a delicious medium rare when I cut it.  Very flavorful.  As an other reviewer suggested, I boiled the marinade and served it as a side sauce but it was too salty and I would not do that again.  The meat, all by itself, was really flavorful.  Good recipe.

I would definitely make again. I followed the instructions except that I added balsamic vinegar,  about 1/4 cup and I also added some homemade steak sauce. We don't eat meat with pink and it was very tender and really, really tasty! Cooked it about 8 to 9 minutes on each side on a cast iron indoor grill pan.

I make this recipe exactly as stated and usually broil it in my oven when not able to grill.  I have made this many times and even use it as a freezer meal.  Once all the ingredients and meat are placed in a ziplock bag, I pop it in the freezer..   When I am ready to use, I let it thaw overnight and cook.  It tastes amazing and so easy,  love it!!!  One of the best recipies I have found on all recipes.

I made no adjustments to the recipe, but I missed the part about piercing with a fork, and I ran short on time so I marinated for just 5 hours.  The steak was very good, though just a little too salty, and it was tender enough, but probably would have been better if I had followed the directions and fork-tenderized.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but I will either use less soy sauce or will use low-sodium soy sauce to cut down on the saltiness.

Awesome marinade for london broil. I had just a bit under 1/2 cup of soy sauce, so I used a bit of worcestershire sauce to fill in the rest. Also added 1 extra clove of garlic. Used my Foodsaver to marinate the meat to cut down on time (marinated for 2 hours in the fridge and it marinated beautifully). Grilled for 8 minutes per side over a medium heat, came out perfectly medium rare/medium. The amount of juice that the meat produced was amazing! Never had london broil that juicy before! Side note: london broil should be cut as thin as possible, against the grain, JUST SAYIN'! Thanks for the simple, but oh-so-awesome recipe, Char!

This is realllyy good. I marinated the meat overnight and the meat turned out very flavorful. The meat was surprisingly tender too, I've always had issues with meat that gets hard when cooked which gives me toothache. So this is definitely a keeper.

I was excited about this recipe because of all the great reviews and I made it exactly as written with the exception of adding two tablespoons of lemon juice, but was WAY too salty. It does have great potential, however, but you MUST cut down on the soy sauce and maybe also use low sodium soy sauce.  I will try this recipe again using 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and I'm sure it will be excellent.  The acid (lemon juice or vinegar) is absolutely necessary to tenderize this inexpensive cut of meat and it must be sliced very thin and across the grain.  As some others have said, if you run a grilling fork all the way through the meat a good number of times you don't need to marinate it for as long as 24 hours.  My finished steak had great (but too salty) flavor all the way through the meat with just 5 hours of marinating in a gallon size Ziplock bag.  I grilled it on med/high heat for 6 minutes a side (grill top UP - you don't want to bake it) for a perfect medium rare, but all grills vary so your times may be different.

This was really great.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was very salty.  I guess low sodium soy sauce would fix that.

Tried it last night on a New York strip steak.  I am never sure of the quality of the steak as we have been so disappointed in prior attempts to make a "great" steak at home.  That was until last night.  We were amazed how tender and flavorful the meat was and will make this marinade again.

I agree with all the 4 star ratings. I have tried to make London Broil a few times before and it always turned out like shoe leather. WOW was I wrong, this recipe made a true believer out of me. I did sprinkle some meat tenderizer on the meat(just because of the bad experience I had with this cut of beef.) I marinated for 24 hrs, Grilled for 3 to 5 each side, for med. rare and it was Wonderful. I let my husband take all the credit,(after all he was the one doing the grilling).

Anti-London Broil husband was really skeptical and doubtful when he saw that I was following a recipe. However, the reviews don't lie. We scored the meat all around, marinaded overnight and ate grilled steak for less than $10! Plus I have lunch for tomorrow! Score!

This was an easy and tasty marinade. I left it overnight and in the morn threw it in the crockpot with some potato cullings and chopped onion.Added a splash of water so the potatoes wouldn't scorch,put it on low for 61/2 hours and had the yummiest,easiest supper. Hubby polished it all off!!

My husband mentioned a few times how much he liked the marinade, and even my little girls who usually turn their noses up at steak ate it. I only marinated the meat for about two hours and the meat still had a very nice flavor. Definitely making this again.

I made this exactly as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because that was what I had and it was the most delicious marinade I've ever tried, my husband said it was a 10 and we couldn't stay out of it. Our store calls top round roast a London Broil and it was a little tough even after marinating so I think next time I'll try sirloin steaks and keep the marinade exactly the same because it is really the best marinade I've ever eaten, the  flavor is incredible, I called my family and raved and it was so good I called my neighbors over to try it. They loved it too and wanted the recipe, it's that delicious!

I used 1/4 c soy sauce and 1/4 c worchestershire sauce.  Added 2 T balsamic vinegar.  Added more garlic, and 1/4 t pepper.  I marinated about 5 hours (would have done more but ran out of time).  I flipped every hour.  I broiled.  Excellent.  My roommates loved it, too... and ate all of it before I got any leftovers.

The first time I made this recipe was a week ago. The family loved it! I made it yesterday 11/9/10 but this time I changed it and only used a 1/4 cup of Soy Sauce. My family still loved it!

This was a wonderful marinade.  I didn't marinate it for 8 hours like the recipe said but a good 5 hours or so and it was wonderful.  The meat had so much flavor.  I broiled mine for about 5 - 8 minutes per side.  My kids were even asking for more and more of this (they are ages 3 and 5).  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent marinade!  I was looking for a lower fat version for a steak marinade (my go to steak marinade had 1/2-3/4c. oil!) and I was really happy with this!  I add 1-2 Tbl. of balsamic vinegar to help tenderize the meat.  Really good!  Everyone raves about it!

Delicious!!!  I followed what someone else did and used 1/4 cup soy, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, and I used forks to tenderize the steak, then rubbed lightly with lemon juice and added a little meat tenderizer to the marinade - nice and tender and GREAT flavor!!  Will definitely make again!!

This was awesome. I followed the recipe almost exactly, substituting 1/2 cup soy sauce for 1/4 cup each of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. In addition, I added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar. I let the meat sit out for 40 minutes or so before taking it to a hot grill for 5 minutes a side. I could have even gone 4 minutes a side and gotten that perfect medium rare. Either way, it was awesome and I will be doing this again and again! Very economical piece of meat.

This is the best marinade ever for the grill! Will be making London Broil more often now that I found this recipe. I marinated mine for almost 24 hours and could not believe the flavor and tenderness of the meat. We didn't even use the A1 sauce! You have to try this marinade!

Phenomenal flavor! Our london broil (cooked on the grill to medium-rare, set for 15 minutes before cut) was extremely tender and juicy:) We added a couple of tbsp of orange juice to the recipe, as a tenderizer/sweetener, and it tasted great:) I also boiled the remaining marinade (to kill any bacteria left by the meat) and drizzled a few tbsp of it onto our stir-fried veggies - VERY good idea:) Definitely a 5-star marinade recipe!

This has a really good flavor but it was still tough after marinating for 15 hours.  I took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup of soy and 1/4 cup of balsamic vineager.

I've never had much success with "London Broil" before, but the marinade made all the difference.  I did follow one of the reviews and halved the soy sauce, added 1/4 cup worcestershire and 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar.  My family rated the result "excellent"

This was good, but a little salty.  I followed the recipe plus added 1/4 c. of Balsamic Vinegar as recommended by reviewers for tenderizing.  I marinated it for a full 24 hours.  The cut of beef used was a Beef Round Top Round London Broil, and it was very tough even when I sliced it thin!...maybe I should have marinated it longer or really pierced it with a fork a lot more?  I probably would avoid buying this cut of meat again, and we have other marinades that we prefer.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't make any changes except add a little more garlic because we love it. Made this for a Valentines evening dinner and was a hit for the both of us. The cooked marinade ends up being a great mock "au jus". Am planning on making this again tomorrow and can't wait!

Good flavor that is different from our normal flank steak.  The meat is still a bit tougher so be sure to cut very thin slices across the fiber of the meat.

Delicious and unique flavor!!  Here are my small changes - I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to the marinade, and I did not add ketchup.  Also, instead of oregano and pepper, I added a Cajun blacken spice.  (It includes oregano and pepper in the ingredients.) I marinated it for close to 20 hours.  The meat was still pretty tough.  Next time I might try slow cooking the meat so it will become more tender.

Fairly good recipe, but nothing amazing.  I made a couple changes: tons of garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to cut the strong soy sauce flavor.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and freshly cracked black pepper.  Let it marinate overnight, and the results were delicious.  Served with buttermilk mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This is a great marinade!  At first I was worried about what the ketchup would taste like, but it turned out fantastic.  Perfectly seasoned meat.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of sweet rice vinegar to tenderize the meat and I let it marinate overnight.

Super recipe. I usually find that london broil can dry out very easily but this was very tender and juicy!!!

Fantastic recipe! I made minor changes - 1/3 cup soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup, and 2 teaspoons onion flakes added to the garlic I had on hand. I marinated the steak for 3 1/2 hours and the meat turned out tender, and flavorful. I served the steak with "New Potatoes with Caper Sauce" from this site. Rave reviews from all! Thank you for this recipe, I will use it often.

This was a great recipe for london broil.  I left out the ketchup and oregano and also used the 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce.  This was very easy to prepare and cook for several people.  I reduced the rest of the marinade and used it as a sauce.  If you do that (and it does taste good) don't put to much sauce on the meat as you will probably find it too salty.  So just be careful to the amount of sauce you use, if you decide to reduce the sauce.  But overall I thought this was a great way to serve London Broil and will use this in the future.

I'm giving this a 4 because the flavor of the marinade really was good, but I just hadn't realized what a tough cut of meat London Broil really is!  Even after rubbing it down with balsamic vinegar and marinating it for 36 hours it was difficult to eat.  Not the recipe's fault though!  So based on the flavor of the marinade, it gets 4 stars.  I just won't be buying this cut again!

Did not go over well.  Tasted too over processed and seasoned.  Will look further for next time or just use salt and pepper, etc.

you know what....just follow the recipe, exactly and you won't be disappointed.  i appreciate others opinions on this one but truly, i bought a cheap 1.5 pound round steak, marinated it from 7pm-6pm the next day, turning it twice, slapped it on the bbq and it was so flavorful and tender and perfectly marinated through.  it's a basic, good recipe which i'm sure is delicious on flank steak as well.  thanks.

Easy recipe!  All we had was those steaks they use in carne asadas (thinner steaks), so marinated that for a day.  Two big pieces, put it in a 9x13 baking dish, topped it with sliced onions and mushrooms put it in for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and it was great.  Thanks!

Very good!!  The whole family loved it.  I did use Worchesire Sauce instead of the soy as we don't care for things very salty.  This is a "keeper".

Wow! This was great! I had only 1/4 c. of (low sodium) soy left, so I added 1/4 cup of Worcestshire like others suggested. Amazing! (I'll make it like this from now on.) As we love garlic, I added a fourth clove. I suggest using fresh garlic, rather than the jarred kind. For presentation, I added sauteed button (white) mushrooms. This tasted like a meal you'd expect at a nice restaurant. This is a keeper, and goes in my "make often" file.

This was PERFECT. The marinade was just right (I added a little sweet bbq sauce) and the steak came out so juicy and flavorful. I only marinated it for about 5 hours, and it was excellent, so next time I will try marinading overnight and I bet it will be heavenly. I'll make this over and over for sure, thank you!

I made this with just 1 clove of garlic (was plenty for me) and scored both sides of the meat diagonally.  The taste was wonderful - my husband ate all of it in 1 sitting!  I cooked mine under the broiler (about 7 minutes on each side) and it came out great.

My family and I were not impressed with this recipe.  I can't put my finger on what it was exactly but we just didn't care for the overall taste of the marinade.  Although, I have to say, our three year old enjoyed it very much and ate it up like nothing else!!  Needless to say, I won't be making this one again.

the meat was tender, but we didn't care for the taste. My family family likes a sweeter meat such as teryiaki....

Great tasting marinade but the meat was still a little tough.  I will try the marinade with another cut of meat next time.

I have made this recipe about 7 times now. My family, friends and I absolutely love this recipe. Though I agree it has a salty taste, I still can not get enough of it. I plan to make it again for our Labor Day Camping trip, and I might even try it with low sodium soy sauce.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. While it was good, it didn't rate the rave reviews that I've seen for it.  Even used lite soy sauce and found it still a little too salty.

I use the marinade for this on just about every type of meat I cook. It's excellent and different from the same old garlic powder and meat tenderizer! Yummy!!

Fantastic!  The steak turned out yummy and crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside.  Next time I'll use 50% less salt soya sauce as it was a little salty.  I'll make this recipe again!

I marinated the steak for two days and it was excellent.  I did not have oregano so I used about 1/2 the amount of rosemary.  It came out fine.

this was amazing!  no need for steak sauce.  we followed it exactly and the only thing we would change is adding a little water to cut the soy sauce.  it was very salty, but will definately make this again!

I used this recipe for a dinner party of 8 and received rave reviews!  It was the first london broil that I had ever prepared, but it certainly won't be the last.  I did not alter the recipe any and it was absolutely delicious!!

I used flank steak instead of the round but will try a better cut of meat next time. This maranade would work with any meat, even chicken, although I don't think you wouldn't marinate chicken in this for overnight.
I loved it!  Flavorful and full of my favorite seasonings.
This is a keeper for me.

Some soft pieces, but mostly still a pretty tough cut of meat.  The marinade was good and we'll try it on a better cut of meat next time.

Very easy to make this marinade.  However, thought it overpowered the taste of the meat.  The soy sauce made it extremely salty.  Maybe using light soy sauce would make it less overpowering.

I ran out of propane, so I had to substitute the rotiserre (sp) for the grill.  I have to say that it came out very flavorful.  Will definetly do this again.
