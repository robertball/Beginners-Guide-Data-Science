This is how I make my potato salad! Except I leave out the mustard and add sour cream to the mayonnaise (about 3/4 sour cream and 1/4 mayonnaise) and add a little dill weed over the top. The grilled potatoes are what makes this salad! I also just grill the potatoes on a charcoal grill without the foil......The burnt outsides are delicious in the salad.
