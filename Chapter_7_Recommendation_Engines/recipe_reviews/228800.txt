I loved these, but I did make a couple of small modifications to suit my tastes and to substitute ingredients I had available.  I replaced the applesauce with butter, and the yogurt with sour cream - in other words, all butter, all sour cream.  I don't care for the orange/cranberry flavor so I replaced the orange juice with milk.  I also used coarsely chopped fresh cranberries.  I loved the flavor and richness of the butter and sour cream and prefer those substitutions for the applesauce and Greek yogurt, ingredients I don't generally have on hand anyway.  The pecans, while a suitable addition, could easily be omitted and I might prefer that also.  All and all, a beautiful, nicely domed cranberry muffin with just right sweetness and spice.

I cut this recipe back by half to get 12 muffins. I used my own homemade applesauce amd two tablespoons orange juice concentrate for a stronger orange flavor. I made no other changes. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at almost 22 minutes. I did get 12 bigger sized muffins out of a halved recipe. These muffins were very moist, chewy and had a wonderful assortment of flavors that worked very well together. GREAT muffin recipe. I'd like to try this again with fresh cranberries next time and see how that works out.

When I made the first batch we found them to be dry and not very sweet.   So I just made another batch with these revisions:  3/4 c. butter, 1 1/4 c white sugar and 1 1/4 c brown sugar.    Now hubby and daughter give them a resounding 5.

Delicious!  Only substitution I made was the 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup plain Greek yogurt for 2 cups of plain yogurt.  Mainly because I did not have the original ingredients.  I also substituted walnuts for pecans since I also did not have pecans.  Turned out delicious.  Almost like a scone which I love.  The hubby also really enjoyed it.

Very moist and delicious.  I loved these muffins.  I did not use applesauce though.  I used a crushed cranberry, pineapple, apple mixture leftover from thanksgiving.  Worked just like applesauce.  oooh its so good!!  Bless you Mr. Food.

Excellent! I reduced the sugar by half, used concentrated orange juice instead of regular,added a tablespoon of water so it would be liquid, used vanilla yogurt instead of plain made it twice, a great recipe for parties or gatherings, makes a lot of muffins. You can also stash unused dough in the fridge for later or cut recipe ingredients in half for a smaller batch, but I like it how it is. Next time I will use frozen cranberries I bought on sale, and see how that turns out.

The muffins came out well.  I didn't measure exact as to how much sugar, I always put in a bit less so are enot  too sweet.  For once I had all the ingredients required.  I had done an ingredient search for sour cream and apple sauce with cinnamon and this muffin recipe came up.  I had cooked some apples that needed to be used up and had added cinnamon! All Recipes site is sure handy.  Anyway I had almost a full container of probiotic vanilla yoghurt which I needed to use up before expiry date and which equaled 2 cups and used that instead of with sour cream.  The dusting of sugar and cinnamon on top the muffins sure was the icing on a cake!  Wow, they are delicious.  Thank you.

I needed to use up some yogurt and I found this recipe. Since I had just a little sour cream, I made up the difference with yogurt.  I always forget to put the sugar toppings on recipes...but it was great without it.

This was an easy and excellent recipe!  Very moist and flavorful!  I did not put in pecans, I didn't have any, but I will next time I make these!  I was out of sour cream, so I doubled the amount of Greek yogurt and it turned out fine.  For extra flavor I added orange zest I had in the freezer into the batter and on top with the cinnamon sugar.  It added the perfect extra oomph to the muffins!  I also used frozen cranberries instead of dried.  No problem there as well.  This recipe made 24 regular muffins and about 23-24 mini muffins!  Perfect for our family of 6 for a couple of days!

We found these muffins to be a bit on the dry side and except for biting into a cranberry mostly on the bland side.  Plus they really stuck to the papers.
