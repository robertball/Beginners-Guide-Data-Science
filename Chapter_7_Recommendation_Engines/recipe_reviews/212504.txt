Enjoyed this recipe a lot although altered it significantly due to lack of exact ingredients. I used balsamic vinaigrette. I used a bit over a pound of chicken (one 2 breast pack of Costco's sealed 6 pack) I added one chopped up roasted red pepper towards the end but would recommend adding at the beginning to spread the flavor. I had no chicken broth so used ground beef broth from which I had removed the fat. I added a bit of water so I'd have enough liquid. Rather than cream cheese I used about 1/3 cup of sour cream. Loved the recommendation of just letting the spinach just wilt. I tend to overcook spinach. After letting the spinach stand covered for 5 min I added a bunch of grape tomatoes cut in half. They heated up from the warmth of the rest and it tasted great and looked great. The parmesan adds a lot of flavor. Thanks for submitting! I have never rated before but my husband and I really liked this meal.

This was really good.  I followed the recipe, for the most part.  I didn't have brown rice so I used instant white rice instead and added about 12oz of spinach, instead of 10 oz.  This recipe was quick and easy to make on a week-night.  It was creamy and thick.  I wished that I would have added a bit more salad dressing and chicken broth upfront, but overall I'm pleased with this recipe.  I'll certainly make it again.

This was amazing!! I cheated because I was starving after work. I used a handful of the precooked chicken breast strips, didn't have the same dressing so just used a couple squirts of the O&V that I had & a touch of minced garlic. I added a small can of mushrooms at this point WITH most of the juice(didn't have broth)and a cup of minute brown rice (after microwaving). I only used a couple spoonfuls of cream cheese though. Enough to trick myself into thinking it was alfredo, but less calories. (half fat) It totally worked!!! I seriously want to like the pan while it's still hot!

This is a great recipe base with lots of options for customizing it. I didn't have spinach or roasted red pepper Italian dressing. Substituted regular Italian dressing and sauteed red bell peppers, onions, and some extra garlic in it. Added some leftover cubed cooked chicken breasts and let it all cook together for about 3 minutes. My boys who despise anything rice, ate this up with no complaints even asked for seconds.

I'm giving 5 stars for my modifications: I had chicken breast, some fresh spinach, but I substituted (what I had): Penne pasta instead of rice, half&half & italian cheese blend instead of cream cheese, omitted the tomatoes, still used the italian dressing & the broth. This was a good base recipe, OMG, my version turned out so Yum, everyone had seconds!

This recipe was wonderful although I did make changes. I diced the chicken and cooked it in 1/4 cup of the dressing. I added another 1/4 cup of the dressing to the broth too. I cooked 1 cup of brown rice in 2 cans of chicken broth and added it all to the pan. I added a can of basil garlic tomatoes and no spinach, but I did throw in a can of sliced mushrooms. Hubby says this is  definitely a keeper! Very flavorful!!

This was a very good meal - tasted yummy, as is and my family (husband and teenage daughter) really enjoyed it.  However, I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's not quite perfect.  Next time, I'll add more Italian dressing and/or chicken broth to make it a little more moist.  I'd also like to try it with a little onion and some mushrooms - this is the perfect recipe for more veggies.  I definitely recommend it, and it's easy to tweak to your personal tastes.

This is really quite good. I doubled the recipe for more people and made my own marinade instead of using dressing. Using olive oil and Italian spices. I threw in a half cup of Parmesan and Asiago cheeses when I tossed in the spinach , and  topped  with the same cheeses. It was fantastic!!! Every single person LOVED IT.... even the 2 year old

I wanted to make this a little healthier, so I swapped the cream cheese for 1/2 cup light mozzarella. I also added an orange bell pepper. I had to add another 1/2 cup broth and an extra squirt of dressing then cook another 20 mins to get the rice as soft as I wanted.

This was great, though I made some modifications based on suggestions here - added saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and garlic. Also just used regular Italian dressing which I likely doubled (I eyeballed everything). Added a little salt and pepper as well. Yum!

This recipe was more an inspiration than something I followed closely. I browned the chicken in a bit of butter, added Italian dressing, garlic, and mushrooms...also more spinach than what was called for. First time I ever used instant brown rice but it surely sped things up and it was so delicious!

This was an easy mid week dish to make. The brown rice added a nutty depth and the sauce was simple but delicious. No additional spices were needed which I normally have to add. I could not find the dressing listed so I used regular Italian dressing and threw some red peppers in with the chicken. Thanks for sharing - it's a keeper!!

The taste was good, but my rice took forever to cook. I had to add another 1/4 cup dressing and another 3/4 cup water.

It was good but.....
I would add in more broth and take out some cream cheese. The cream cheese flavor was very strong, so I would put in less of that and maybe add some milk to make up for it.

This was soo good. I was a little leery about using bottled salad dressing, I have tried before with horrendous outcomes. Everything turned out really good and so simple to make. I did add mushroom, onions and garlic which I sauteed together and then followed the recipe. Yummy :)

This looked like a good starter recipe--- needed some tweaking. I added some mushrooms, a good helping of  Worcestershire sauce and used zesty Italian dressing instead. Very tasty... Will make this one again!
