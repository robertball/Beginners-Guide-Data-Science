I find fish and chips to be rather bland most of the time, so I seasoned the haddock with Goya Adobo seasoning. Otherwise I followed the directions for the fish.  The corn flakes sometimes stuck to the pan, leaving me with a couple of naked filets. I  squeezed some fresh lemon juice on them at the end, and everyone seemed to like the fish.
For the sweet potato fries, I used frozen, but seasoned and baked them as the recipe directed. Everone liked those fine too.
The cole slaw...it was not good. The yogurt gave it a sour taste and chalky consistency. I like the idea of a healthier slaw,  but next time I'll  stick to a vinegar based slaw.
