I made this for my family at Easter and it came out terrific.  The only substitution I made was vegetable oil for the shortening.  Can't wait to make and share it again.

I changed the recipe for family preferences, so used spelt flour, honey instead of sugar, oil instead of butter and shortening, and dark cocoa instead of the chocolate.  WOW!  This is a sophisticated banana bread!
I will have to more more tomorrow!

I love this recipe but I did make changes:  I substituted Splenda for the sugar (my husband prefers it), used bitter orange-flavored olive oil for the shortening and added about a tablespoon of honey for layering of flavor, although I'm not sure it is needed.  I also made muffins instead instead of a loaf.  Wonderful moist recipe!
