I love rutabage fries.  I coat mine with smoked paprika and sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  I don't like rosemary, so I don't use that, but garlic powder is tasty, too.  I don't use fresh garlic, because I think these need to cook at a higher temp and for longer than 30 minutes, and the garlic would burn.  I would suggest at least 425 for really nicely browned pieces.  Mine never get super crispy, but I don't care...I love them!

These were really really tasty and smelled wonderful cooking. I found the cooking time to be off though. At 30 mins my fries were still undercooked and not browned at all. I think maybe a slightly hotter oven might work better. I had a hot spot in my oven so some of them got a little too dark, but those were yummy too.

I tossed mine with a little himalayan salt, cracked pepper, pinch of italian seasonings olive oil and parmesan cheese grated (very light on the parm), and I cut them super thin and did them on a pizza stone at 425 for 15 minutes. Perfectly crispy and browned. Was great. Will make them often just like this.

These are so good! Taste like a cross between a potato, sweet potato, and a carrot. We used kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder. When they were done we sprinkled paprika. I would suggest flipping them a few times since ours burnt a little on the bottom.

I bought a rutabaga for the first time the other day and decided to try cooking one.  Found this recipe and decided to try. I love the distinct flavor of the rutabaga and coating with the rosemary and garlic worked well.  The only con was that they didn't get as crunchy as I'm use to with fries. I cooked 30 mins and then flipped and cooked another 10 mins.  I may have had too many on the pan, because they were close together and maybe that's why they weren't as crunchy or maybe this is just how they are.  They were a great snack though, will make again.

I admit, I was skeptical, but these were great.  I used smoked paprika and cumin instead of rosemary, but honestly - - this would work with just about any spice.

These were just okay for us.  It was our first time trying rutabaga.  The flavor was good, but the texture did not meet our expectations.  I followed the recipe, but mine did not crisp up at all, they had a limp and somewhat soggy texture.

These were amazing!  I made mine 3 different ways. 1-with rosemary and garlic powder (didn't have fresh garlic) 2-plain with kosher salt 3-paprika and kosher salt.  Each flavor was awesome--I overindulged a bit on them!

I decided to give these a try. They are good I love rutabega. Just 30 min in my oven was not long enough. 60 min was the time for them to be done. So be patient

We loved these fries! used herbed de Provence and salt. We baked it for longer than 30 min, and it was well caramelized, but not yet crispy. Would love tips on how to crips it up. Very flavorful recipe. Thank you.

These did not crisp up - ever.  I checked at 30 minutes, at 60 minutes.  I tried increasing the temperature - no crisp.

They were tasty - almost like a sweet potato fry, just disappointed about lack of crispness.

I roasted these along with some carrots and parsnips.  Added just a tiny drizzle of balsamic reduction.  Very tasty and versatile recipe!  I can foresee experimenting with a variety of seasonings, oils and herbs.

This is probably a good recipe IF you like rutabagas...but I did not like this at all. I'm just not a fan of rutabaga. First time trying a rutabaga and it will be the last!

I *want* to love these. But. I used my own garden-grown, just-harvested rutabaga. My own  fresh garlic and rosemary. Followed the recipe exactly. They're just not very crisp, and the minced garlic fell off and burned on the pan. I won't give up, though! I'll keep trying to make a perfect rutabaga oven fry, and I appreciate the opportunity to try this recipe!

Loved these!!  I used garlic salt, smoked paprika, and ground red pepper in place of the other seasonings listed here.
