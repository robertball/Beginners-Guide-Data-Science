I made this recipe using non-fat sweetened condensed milk and the equivilent of 5 eggs with the fake eggs and my friends loved it! They said they couldn't tell the difference. If you have never melted sugar before, be sure not to stir it while it is melting ... I learned that the hard way.

This is a very easy-to-follow and nearly fool-proof recipe. Do not expect a super creamy rich flan, because this is not. It is certainly a lighter but still yummy flan. I, however, have made an extensive alteration to this recipe that I could post as a new recipe but I find the instructions and basic ingredients from Mogirimi so wonderful that I just decided to post my modifications. My modified flan is orange-flavored and it turned out perfect. To make the flan slightly richer I used 6 whole eggs (you'll get more custard mix this way) and used regular sweetened condense milk. I subsituted 1/4 cup of the water with triple sec (any orange liquer will do) and added 1 tps of grated orange peel. I also added nutmeg to taste. For the sugar, I highly advise you use baker's quality sugar (it melts better). Cooking time will vary depending on what you put your custard in. It may take an hour if the water you added was not boiling and you are cooking in a pie pan (mine took an hour). This orange-flavored version is to die for. I made it for Cinco de Mayo and it disappeared. Enjoy!

I made this with regular condensed milk and poured it into 8 ramekins for individual flans.  The baking time was shorter.  My family LOVED it.  I loved how easy it was!

We got back from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico six days ago where we thought we had eaten the nicest, freshest, creamiest Spanish flan ever.  This recipe showded up in my weekly AllRecipes newsletter, so thought I would give it a try.  Wow, was this easy and delicious.  Wish I could give it 10 stars.  So easy to make, and my wife was very proud of me !!

This flan is absolutely delicious!  My girlfriend is Puerto Rican and loves flan.  She always buys the flan that you make from a box, so I decided I would TRY to make this recipe.  It was SO easy and SO delicious!  My girlfriend loved it and I make this AT LEAST twice a week!  Thank you for this fabulous recipe; I wouldn't change a thing!

I love flan, but I hate the fat and etc. that comes with the flan.  This is an excellent alternative, you'd never know that this was lower in fat and cholesterol. I cooked exactly as the recipe reads. It was wonderful.

I have never made flan, nor do I really like flan but chose to make this for a girls Mexican dinner party.  It was a hit and so easy to make.  I had very little leftovers but what was left, my husband managed to finish off when I got home.

This was quick and easy.  Especially nice because you make it the day before.  I used regular condensed milk because that was all I had and it was fantastic!

I made quite a few modifications to this recipe. I used regular sweetened condensed milk and used five whole eggs; next time I will use only four as the mixture was slightly overflowing. As per another reviewer's suggestion, I added some grated nutmeg and 1/4 cup orange liqueur (blue-label Grand Marnier; it would have been good to added in some orange zest. My guests found the sauce a little watery, and suggested I add some butter to the sugar while I melt it to get a nice and thick caramel consistency. My first time making flan, and it didn't crack in half! This is a good recipe, and I will continue to play around with it. EDIT(o6/21/o9): Adding butter to the sugar while melting may add more calories, but improves the taste and consistency of the caramel topping.

I only had regular condensed milk and it still came out good. Texture was smooth and silky and tasted like a professional flan from outside. Couldn't eat more than a slice though because it was so sweet. This isn't necessarily a fault of the recipe however because flan is just naturally very sweet for a dessert. For personal preference you might want to lower the sugar or caramel.

SO DELICIOUS!
I used to live in Spain, and eat real flan all the time, and I was disappointed about the flan here in the States. Then I made this, and it was almost the same!
Getting the carmel to be just right is the hardest part in my opinion, so, I leave some of the lumps of sugar when I pour it into the baking pan. They get carmelized when you bake it - and it keeps it from getting burnt. :)

I cut this recipe in half and it made 4 perfectly sized individual ramekins which baked a little longer than 30 minutes.  It was almost perfect, except for some reason I couldn't get my sugar to turn brown.  The first time, I used a double boiler and I waited and stirred so long that it crystallized.  The second time I tried I used a small saucepan on med-low and I couldn't even get it to melt even though the pan was perfectly warm! I added a little water and a touch of vanilla and it melted instantly (this is supposedly called a "wet caramel"), but it never did turn that caramel color even when I waited. I eventually just gave up to prevent crystallization and poured the melted sugar into the ramekins, which were  already set up in the baking dish with hot water.  Imagine my surprise when, after the cooking and cooling process, the sugar had not hardened into candy (as I have had happen before) but was essentially a clear caramel.  The taste was great even if the presentation wasn't.   I consider myself a good cook but for some reason, caramel gets me!  If you're like me--Don't give up!

This is an easy recipe.  I was a little scared to do it because of the reviews about the sugar, but it turned out really good according to my daughter and friends.  I did not taste it because I don't like like custurds, but I wanted to try it because my friends like it, so it will be a staple when I do Mexican meals.  I could not find the low fat condensed milk so I used the regular.  I was amazed at how easy it was to do caramel.  I have never done anything like that before.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

I usually do not rate recipes, but I was so disappointed in how this turned out.  The consistency was anything BUT creamy and after the amount of time put into it, that made it even more disappointing.

This was my first try at making flan and it turned out perfect.  My family and I loved it.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and heated my pan in the oven for 5 min. before adding the syrup.  I think I would have had a problem had I not done this.  Thanks for a great recipe and the advice.

Made this recipe with my husband for my parents when they came over for dinner. My mother loves flan, so this was for her! I am not a big fan of flan myself nor is my father, but this was without a doubt the best flan I have had. My father and I have been converted. Excellent and very easy. Since we made this pretty last minute, couldn't find low fat condensed milk so used full fat, and added an additional egg yoke, since we made the recipe for 6. Put in individual ramekins and decreased the cooking time to 40 minutes.

Except for the beautiful roses (you are very talented Allegra!) my flan came out just like the one in teh picture. Because of reviews complaining about the texture & it not holding it's shape, I used an additional egg yolk & I cooked this in 12 oz. ramekins (filled 4 perfectly) for  45 minutes. After refrigerating for a few hours (mine were set in about 4 hours) I unmolded them onto antique china plates & garnished them w/ a sprig of mint & a fanned out strawberry.  These were fantastic...thanks Mogirimi! Oh yeah, I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk & I used a diffuser under my skillet when making the caramel.

I had to bake this flan for approximately 1 hour and twenty minutes. The idea of omitting the water sounded good. It tasted okay, but maybe I will have better luck next time without the water.

Easy and tastes delicious!  The recipe was enough to fill 8 ramekins.  I put the ramekins in a rectangular Pyrex baking dish and fill it halfway up the ramekin with hot water.  Baked approx. for 30 minutes.

I made this for a dinner party this weekend and it was my first time ever making flan.  OMG!  It turned out AWESOME and was the hit of the party.  Frankly, I can't stop thinking about it.  I did change a few things as follows:  I used 4 whole eggs rather than the yolk/whites mixture.  I also ground up 1 tablespoon of instant french roast coffee granules and put that in with the egg/water/milk/vanilla mixture.  The coffee flavor was the perfect touch to make this dessert so special.  I was surprised when I inverted the flan that the caramel mixture had liquified.  I guess this is to be expected, right?  Regardless, it was one of the best desserts I've ever made and I am eagerly anticipating the next opportunity I have to make it!

Excellent Flan and here is an awesome variation! 

I used liquid egg whites + 2 regular eggs, 2 tsps of vanilla extract, and a can of COCO LOPEZ Cream of Coconut in addition to the the low fat sweetened condense me...oh my god, the cream of coconut made this dish so delicious and creamier. Then I topped with sweetened flaked coconut.

Also, I didn't use any salt or melted sugar.

Amazing!! I used regular sweetened condensed milk because I could only find that and fat-free (no low-fat) but next time I'll try fat-free. 
Tip for carmelizing the sugar - turn the heat UP! Med-low did nothing for me, try med-high and it will carmelize in just a few mins.

This tasted pretty good but we didn't think it was nearly as rich as flan we have eaten at restaurants. I also needed to put it back in the oven as it was still quite wet in the middle even after it had cooled. Finally, the presentation left a lot to be desired; It just kind of flopped out of the dish in a big brown sticky puddle, nothing at all like the beautiful flan in Allegra's photo! I will certainly try this again but will use full fat condensed milk, and will cook it in individual ramekin dishes.

This was really delicious and so easy.  The texture could have been just a bit creamier, but the taste was heavenly.  The caramel sauce took on a nice, maple-syrupy flavor.  The presentation was lovely as well.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow, what a great recipe!  Caramel flan is my favorite dessert, so I am always eager to try a new recipe.  I used regular sweetened condensed milk and forgot the salt, but it turned out perfect! Everyone loved it.  A little firmer than other versions that use normal milk.  Cooking time was perfect, resist the temptation to keep cooking until firm! As note says, should still be jiggly when it comes out of oven...will firm up as it cools.

I made this..followed the instructions completely and it was a miserable failure. I'm not sure what I did wrong. It was over cooked and mealy tasting. I backed it in a ceramic dish..was this the issue.

Once you've mastered the challenge of making the caramel (without burning it), all else is a breeze.

My parents loved it. I don't really like flan in the first place, so I'm kind of predisposed to not like it, but out of all the flans I've tasted, this is one of the best in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great tasting flan. I used 4 whole eggs, and regular sweetened milk for mine. The only thing is, I cooked it for a full hour and middle was just set, however after I inverted it and tried some, the bottom layer seemed like overcooked egg. You know kind of chewy and tough. So I think next time i'll watch a little closer, so it doesn't burn quite as much. I like my flan smooth and creamy. Great recipe.

I made this for the first time for an authentic, everything homemade dinner party for 13 people.  It was fantastic.  I put the ingredients in a muffin pan instead of a larger pan.  Turned out perfect.  Everyone was so impressed and loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and didn't change anything except the pan size and the cooking and cooling times because of that.

I made this exactly as the recipe requires and it turned out great. The only thing is when taking it out of the fridge; it might be a good idea to put it in warm water before turning over. To make sure the caramel is not hard. Other than that one addition it was great. Whoever said the caramel was watery did not know what they were talking about it was at perfect consistency as well as the flan itself that needed to sit out to set as with any flan before being refrigerated. This is a great recipe for anyone even first timers.

This was a great dessert for my Dad's birthday. b/c he has a gluten allergy, making desserts for him can be challenging.  My only problem was that i used a springform pan which let in water while baking so the outside was watery on the plate.  Other than my error, this recipe was yummy!!

Very good recipe.  I used nonfat condensed milk and covered it tightly while baking. After 1 hour, I turned off the oven, opened the door & let it sit about 30 min.  No problem to unmold after chilling. It was a little soft/curdlike, but not too sweet.  Will definitely make again!

It looked sooo beautiful. I had never prepared caramel in a skillet and it is a great idea because it significantly cuts your time by allowing the sugar to be more spread out on the surface of the pan. The flan was very light, not too sweet, just perfect... by the way people ate this flan , i should have made 2 of them. I followed the recipe exactly and it is the best!! I baked it for 55 minutes and it was still jiggly then but it did set. I'm keeping this recipe!!

Had no sweetened condensed milk and substituted evaporated milk in its place, along with 1/4 cup or so of sugar to sweeten the milk.  It was still so delicious that I ate the whole thing in 1 day. Will be trying it with the condensed milk just to compare. Thank you for this recipe. Glad that it uses a lot of egg whites as opposed to all whole eggs. A GREAT ONE!!  Flan is my weakness!!!

Made this recipe as is and even forgot to get it out when the oven timer went off.  It ended up in there for an extra half hour but was very forgiving and had no problems with it!

My entire family loved it and we'd all given up flan as being too rich with the heavy cream and too cholesterol-laden with the whole eggs the usual recipe calls for.

This was a welcome "light" version that didn't sacrifce any taste.  Very mild and creamy vanilla -- mmm!

Very easy to do and healthy too! I was expecting a smooth custard consistency and apparently it didn't turn out to be that way (probably because this recipe used more egg whites than egg yolk). But the taste was yummy. I will definetely make this again for my next party.

Tasty flan, really excellent for low-fat, but it didn't blow my mind.  Tried almond extract instead of vanilla which was interesting, but I think I'll stick with vanilla next time.

This recipe was great. It came out perfect. I've never had flan nor have ever made. I made it for my husband and he loved every bit of it. Said it was the best he'd ever had!

This flan came out picture perfect! I created the caramel twice due to inexperience with melting sugar--the first time it seemed a little burned--and I baked the flan a bit longer than the recipe called for, but the result was about as perfect as I could hope for. My guests were as impressed as I was. I expect to use this recipe again!

I've made custard before and followed the recipe exactly (except with regular sweetened condensed milk), but the texture turned out a bit curd-like. It wasn't the smooth custard I was expecting. It still tasted good and my family enjoyed it, but I won't make it again.

This flan was amazing!  I used regualr condensed milk because that was all that I had.  I also pre-heated the baking dish before I poured the caramel into it, and I highly suggest doing this.  This is a keeper for my family...thanks!

This is my first attempt at Flan.  I selected this recipe because I wanted to make something "authentic" for a mexican dinner.  I think what I discovered is that I'm not a huge Flan-Fan.  ;) The custard is somewhat bland and although smooth, was more "jello-like" than soft and creamy.  The caramel glaze was thin and watery and also did not add much flavor.  I have to admit that I have not had much flan in the past, but my guests who have said that mine turned out just about how flan is supposed to.  It also looked just like the picture... although I'm starting to wonder if it wasn't overcooked?  I left this in longer than called for because it seemed like it was not fully set.  I realized later though that this was because the carmel itself was liquid, though the custard was cooked, which was what made it "wobble" when I tilted it.  Another tip...  must melt sugar on Medium-Low.  Another reviewer said they put it on High and it melted really fast...  I am sure they must have scorched it though, which I learned the hard way!  :)

This was the first time I attempted to make flan, and it was SO easy and so yummy.  Even my two boys loved it.

I used full fat condensed milk since that was all I had, and I didn't wrap it in the towel (because knowing me I'd burn my house down), and it still came out perfect and yummy.

Delicious.  But, after cooling overnight in the fridge, it stuck to my glass baking dish and came out in clumps.  I'll try it again in a non-stick pan.

This was a great recipe however I had never carmelized sugar before and found it very difficult to work with.  But, I served this for a dinner party and my guests loved it.  The only suggestion I would have is is to use a whole cup of sugar as 3/4 cup was not enough for me.  Overall, it was a nice dessert that I will make again.

WOW! I made this for a dinner party last night and people raved.  They could not believe how creamy and smooth this turned out considering the low-fat ingredients.  People even spooned out the last of the caramel from the dish once the flan was finished.  It was a cinch to make.  Definitely a keeper--thanks for an amazing recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out really good. Very nice flavor. I made it for some friends and they all enjoyed it!  I did use 2 tsp of vanilla. (The only vanilla I keep in my kitchen is double strength.)Thank you Mogirimi!

My first time making flan and it turned out pretty yummy.  It was very delicate and I actually ended up "cracking" my flan a little bit when I was trying to remove it.  But still, the taste was light and still sweet.

I've always been intimidated to make pudding-like desserts but this recipe was dead easy to follow, and the end result was FABULOUS! Made it for my folks when they came over to see my new digs and they absolutely loved it - and none of them have particularly sweet toothes! I think I just found myself a new potluck item!

Very good taste, but WAY WAY too sweet.  This is coming from a person who eats powdered sugar straight from the container. I think i'll look around some more before giving this desert to guests.

This was a really simple recipe and turned out perfectly.  The only thing I had trouble with was that the caramelized sugar wouldn't stick to my nonstick baking pan.  But when it was finished, it was fine.  It isn't my favorite dessert, but I think that is just personal preference and not the recipe.  I expected a creamier texture, more similar to creme brulee, but it was more quiche-like in texture.  I should have guessed that I suppose.

1 used a can of NON-FAT sweetened condensed milk because I couldn't find the low-fat.  It was so rich and creamy, you didn't miss the fat.  Also, I accidentally cooked longer than 1 hour and it still came out great.  Next time I think I'll add a little coffee flavor to the flan, just for variety.  Everyone at work LOVED this recipe!  We ate the whole thing in 1 day!

Since I really love flan but have never made it myself, I was really hoping that this recipe would turn out.  It turned out perfectly!  I could not ask for more.  Yum!

This is creamy and smooth and a little lighter than other flans. I used eight ramekins for ease in serving and it worked out perfectly.
