This was very good and quick to make. I only used one package of the Certo. I have made a lot of other jams in the past and this seemed like too much. I used one package and it was perfect.

This one didn't firm for me and the sugar never dissolved.  I ended up having to cook it a little bit to get the sugar to dissolve and for the jam to 'jell' together.  The flavor was perfect after cooking.

It turned out great, but I did make a couple of changes.  At the end I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to it and cooked before I froze it.  My reason for cooking it was that I was trying to make it thicker.  It made it a little thicker, but the greater benefit for letting it cook awhile is that it blended the flavors together beautifully.  I froze them in smaller containers because I plan to put the jam on kolaches.  Thank you!

This was very easy to make and tastes heavenly!!! I only used half the pectin and still turned out lovely. Made 7 small jars.

I have been making fig jam for a few weeks now and I find that there is NON NEED to use pectin. It cooks down to a cohesive, jam like mass.
