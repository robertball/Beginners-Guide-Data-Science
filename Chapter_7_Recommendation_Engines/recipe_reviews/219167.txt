I followed the recipe exact, only using lactose-free milk. I did not need the additional vegetable oil because I cooked the pancakes on my non-stick griddle. These were fluffy and perfect. I served the pancakes with my homemade Buttery Cinnamon Syrup. The family loved them, especially the kids--they had seconds!

Pretty good pancakes. I would definitely recommend more milk...I used 2c and they were still pretty thick.  Also, I forgot to add the oil to the batter, but it didn't seem to make a difference. They still turned out really good w/o the oil.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I used orange zest and juice instead of lemon. I definitely played around with the spices and added quite a bit more of each. Also added a bit more pumpkin and milk and they turned out perfect! :)

We really loved these!I made them for Valentines breakfast. I did have to use at least a half a cup more milk. I used buttermilk instead of the lemon and milk. Also I had pumpkin pie spice so I used that in place of all the spices. fabulous recipe! Oh also I used white whole wheat flour and I recommend these to everyone!!!

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't have a lemon so I used buttermilk instead of the milk and lemon.  The batter was thick but made a very nice moist and fluffy pancake with very nice flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Sorry Chef John, love your other recipes but really dissappointed in this one.  Was really looking forward to making this as I love pumpkin and pie spice.  However, they were too spicy and overwhelmed the flavor of the pumpkin.  I am sure I could make another iteration of this recipe reducing the spice amounts but don't want to waste the ingredients experimenting.  The only reason I gave it as many stars as I did was I am sure the basic pancake recipe is good.

I tried this recipe today and got rave reviews from some very serious pancake critics in my family.  My sons loved them!  Excellent for Christmas morning brunch and very light and fluffy!

These are fun fall pancakes.  I like min a little thinner, so these were a bit too thick for me.  Next time I will add more milk.  They are very moist.

These pancakes were absolutly delicious! I hate making changes to recipes, but i had no ginger, or allspice. so i added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and about 1 tablespoon of vanilla(i had vanilla to everything). 
This recipe made 18 pancakes for me, and i didnt find any reason to add more milk. i let my batter sit for about 30 mins before cooking, and i found it developed a nice fluffiness about it! I will defintly be making these again. It sure is a nice way to use up leftovers of a can of pumpkin!

I love this recipe!  I have one similar but the lemon is a great twist.  They are very thick pancakes so this time I used whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out much lighter and wonderful.  I have my own spice combination so I didn't try the spices recommended.  I use 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp.ginger,1 tsp. cinnamon.  I think spices are irrelevant when you love to cook and know what you like.  This is the same recipe as, "Pumpkin Pancakes" by Ruth, on this same site minus the lemon and different spices.

This is a great recipe! I'll admit I was skeptical when I watched the video and saw that lemon juice and lemon zest were included but my skepticism vanished as soon as I tasted these. The lemon juice and zest only serves to brighten the flavor of the pumpkin and makes the flavor light and full. 

These pancakes are extremely light and fluffy as well. My husband remarked about that with the first bite. Don't be fooled into thinking these will be dense by how thick this batter seems, just spread it out in the pan with the back of the measuring cup if you want them to spread out more. Don't add more liquid!

The only changes I made were that I used all white sugar instead of brown and white. And I only did that because I had already measured out most of the ingredients before I realized I was out of brown sugar. These were still delicious! I can imagine they'll only be better next time when I have brown sugar to use.

Also, I used a can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk only because I had too many cans of evaporated milk in my pantry and saw this as an excuse to use one. 

This is my "go-to" recipe now for Pumpkin pancakes!

This recipe was very yummy. . .my two sons (ages 5 and 8) loved it!  My younger son helped me mix the ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The spices complement the pumpkin flavor nicely.  I liked the thick batter because it allowed me to form the batter into circles perfectly ;)  The pancakes were light, fluffy and flavorful.  I made 18 4" diameter pancakes and froze some so my boys can enjoy a snack later on. I'll definitely make this recipe again soon :)

Yum! I made these with steamed and mashed butternut squash instead of pumpkin, and they were amazing! A couple other tweaks based on what I had on hand: didn't use allspice, added a bit of nutmeg and cloves (not too much); used melted coconut oil in place of veg oil; used navel orange instead of lemon juice and zest. I think the hint of orange really added to it! I mixed chopped pecans into half the batter. Made a hot pear topping which complimented it wonderfully by cooking one mashed and one chopped bartlett pear with pure maple syrup, a bit of OJ, cinnamon, and cardamom. A wonderful fall brunch.

Good recipe!  A lot like eating a pumpkin muffin with a pancake texture.   I sprinkled chopped pecans and dried cranberries on some of the pancakes.  Very yummy.  Spice is strong. I'm giving it four stars to represent family input.  Reactions from the kids were mixed: Easy Going 9 Year Old Son ate all of his and declared the plain ones two thumbs up.  Picky Eater 7 Year Old Daughter picked at hers, despite them containing all her favorite flavors.  Always Hungry But Opinionated 4 Year Old Daughter gobbled up hers and requested seconds.  Touch And Go Two Year Old Daughter polished hers off before we finished saying the blessing.  Husband had seconds but didn't specifically ask it be put into the rotation.

The best I've tasted.  I love the spiciness.  I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and heaped the other spices as I love extra spice.

I used my own pancake mix and only used the recipe from the pumpkin purée onwards. You must enjoy spices to begin with because they are very prevalent, almost a little too much, IMO. I didn't have allspice and used nutmeg instead. Overall tasty but very spicy.

This is my favourite pancake recipe.  I love it.  It makes wonderful pancakes and waffles.  I leave out the pumpkin and alter the spices for variations.  I have never had anything less than perfect results.

Flavor was good; however, as previously mentioned, batter was way too thick and pancakes would not cook in the middle before burning on the outside.  Easy fix, just add more liquid, and they were really good, with maple syrup, butter and of course Applewood Smoked Bacon.

Tried this recipe as posted, had to add more milk to thin out as advised by other posters, and had to cook longer than suggested and still they came out very doughy! I tried one in the waffle maker to cook through better, but my family still did not like these at all. Sorry, but 4 out of 4 family members said this is a no go for us.

These were nice. We used spelt flour, butter-flavoured rice bran oil and chai syrup. Didn't bother with the zest. Our pancakes were very moist and a little heavy. I expected them to be fluffier. Lemon and brown sugar spread over went with the pumpkin well.

Made just as stated and it was amazing! Aerating the flour mixture makes it wonderfully  fluffy and not dense. Loved it! came out just like the video.

Even tho I try a lot of the recipes I find here, I rarely (if ever) take the time to post a review. I just figure most of them are good or they wouldn't be on here to start with. This time I want to take a few minutes to say how much we enjoyed these Pumpkin Pancakes. Last Fall, my wife went on a pumpkin binge and was making all kinds of recipes with pumpkin as a featured ingredient. Some were good, some not so much. But when I saw these pancakes I knew I had to make them. I enjoy cooking but I always stick to the recipe; I am not experienced enough to play around with the ingredients like many cooks are able to do. This recipe came out perfectly and I followed it exactly to the letter. Maybe some day I will be able to offer advice on modifications, but for now I can only say that if you follow the recipe it will come out very well. I thought maybe I would have some leftover pancakes to freeze for the microwave but they were all eaten in the first round. If you are thinking about trying these Pumpkin Pancakes stop reading and start cooking. They are excellent and very easy to make. I highly recommend this recipe and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did.

This was a great recipe!  I did make a few changes though.  I substituted one cup egg nog and added an additional one and a quarter cup of milk.  These pancakes cooked very nicely on the griddle.  Very light and fluffy and soooooo tasty.  The eggnog gives it a very rich holiday flavor and the pumpkin is highlighted well with the eggnog flavor.  I served these with butter, maple syrup and whipped cream.  Simply delicious.

We all loved it. Used organic pumpkin pie mix so I left out the related spices. Everything else was as written. Let any pancake batter sit a minute after mixing to make  fluffier cakes. Thanks again Chef John!

These pancakes were fabulous! I made them tonight for our occasional "breakfast for dinner," and my hubby & I both agreed the recipe is a keeper. The only change I made was to substitute Truvia white and brown sugars for the regular white and brown sugars, and we could not tell a difference. I will definitely make them again and will probably try adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans -- just because we think everything is better with pecans!

The flavor was good, but you have to cook them slow and low or youll burn the outside while the inside stays mushy. It was thick batter, I think it needs about a 1/2 c. more milk.  I topped it with whipped cream as well, to give it that pumpkin pie feeling.

Delightful change from the usual. These pancakes are delicious! Warm and spicy flavor, reminds me of a cross between pumpkin pie and cake. Light and fluffy texture, and the pure maple syrup really is the frosting on the cake! 
I did find this recipe makes a lot of batter for 2-3 people who eat modest servings and it's difficult to cut it back. 
Next time I make it I think I will try baking small rounds with the leftovers and filling it with a maple frosting, like whoopie pies.

SO YUMMY! My family decided these are better than any traditional pancakes they have had. I did add approx 1/4c more milk and omitted the lemon zest.

This was a very good recipe.  I needed something that I could do with a class of second-graders in small groups.  In order to use fewer spices (that I would have to carry back and forth), I subbed pumpkin pie spice for the other spices and eliminated the lemon zest (too messy).  We did also need to use extra milk; the batter would have been hard to pour without it.  The kids (and teachers) loved the pancakes with just a little powdered sugar on top.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used melted leftover cinnamon butter instead of oil, egg replacer instead of egg (daughter's allergic to eggs), self-rising unbleached flour so I omiited the baking poweder, soda, and salt. I used cinnamon sugar (I make and keep around for coffee) so I omitted the sugar and I probably used more spices, I never measure but I looove spices. I used dry milk and water (which isn't as thick as regular milk) so they didn't turn out super thick like other reviewers were talking about. I used a grittle so I omitted the oil and the cooking time was a lot faster. My family loved these. Thanks for the amazing recipe.

These were lovely, I agree with adding a small amount of extra milk, I wouldn't go as far as another half cup, but it did need more. It really doesn't take much to see that the batter's a bit thick and add a little extra. 

My family loved them, thank you for sharing.

I made the recipe exactly as written except I added some pecan pieces and served it with butter pecan syrup.  Next time I will probably add a little more sugar just because I like mine a little sweeter.  All in all, the pancakes were good.  I just prefer to do a little tweeking.

Tried at 325º and doughy in the middle so adjusted to 350º and cooked them longer, much better. They were indeed very fluffy, just as I hoped.  If I wanted them less fluffy, I would add a little more milk.  The spices were not too much.  I'm going to my sister's house soon and will make them for her kids!  They will love them.

These pancakes tasted like lemon pancakes not pumpkin ones. The strong lemon flavor over powered all of the spices & the pumpkin itself.

These came out great. The batter was very thick, and the pancakes came out nice and fluffy. I made 14 4-inch pancakes. I cooked them in butter instead of oil and served them with maple syrup. My husband, son, and his friend devoured most of them, and my son couldn't wait to eat the leftover pancakes for breakfast the next day. Really unique and delicious recipe.

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever made! The only change I made was to the spices-  i had no allspice so I put in a shake each of nutmeg, cardamom, cloves and extra cinnamon. The texture was thick but perfect and easy to cook with. Just spread out the dough in the pan so they aren't  too thick. They tasted like Tim Horton's pumpkin muffins - an hour later I could still taste the wonderful flavour of these comfort- food pancakes! My husband said with the syrup, they are more like a dessert!

I used 1/2 tsp less sugar added some allspice, 1/8 tsp clove and no oil. It was great. I added milk, but will try the recipe as is next time. They were pretty fluffy with 1/4 c more milk, but might be better without the added fluid. Oh, I made this recipe for 3 servings and used a whole egg.

I love the taste of these; the pumpkin stands out and the warm spices compliment it very nicely.
I should note that I just substituted all the spices listed for a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice.

I'll definitely make these again someday, but I think i'll only be adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of spices because it was a little overpowering. Either that, or i'll just add more pumpkin.

This is not the kind of pancake that you can stack up and gobble down. This pancake is thick, complex, and delicious. You eat one at a time and think about all the flavours. It's beautiful. I love it.

What an amazing pancake recipe. I made them exactly as indicated, and I even made my own pumpkin puree. (the way it should be!) It was fluffy and extremely delicious. The recipe is perfect the way it is, oh man - what a hit with the family, they all loved it! (I used a non-stick frying pan, and used very little oil in my pan.)

I had originally planned to make this recipe for Thanksgiving Day brunch but due to revised work schedules we had to have an earlier Thanksgiving dinner. After promising this brunch to the family I made it for supper the night before Thanksgiving instead...not unheard of to have pancakes for supper in this family...lol.  The only modifications to the recipe was to use half whole wheat flour and orange juice and zest as I forgot to buy a lemon.  Served these with real maple syrup, bacon and fresh fruit on the side.  They turned out very nicely and the family absolutely loved this new variation of pancakes!  My youngest loves to eat these plain for a snack as well.  Will definitely make these again!

WOW!!! These were great and my kids loved them. I did alter it a bit though. I left out the ginger, and added 1 tablespoon more of brown sugar, 1/4 cup more milk and unsalted butter to cook them. They came out light and fluffy. Just DELISH!!

I'm not much of a pancake eater but I can't wait to try these!  My family is going to go bananas!  Thanks Chef John!  :)

*I gave it 5 stars as I couldn't leave that area blank.  I'm sure these will be a hit, but I will adjust my rating, if needed, after I make them.

Made these this morning...delicious!!  However, the batter was a little thick so I added another 1/2 cup milk.  I also discovered I had no cinnamon, ginger or allspice, so I used 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I also added 1/2-3/4 c chopped walnuts.  Even my husband ate them!  I will be making this again!!!!

This is the real deal! Wonderful! I use butter to cook instead of oil, just a personnel preference. You can also sub buttercup squash with great results.

I really loved this recipe.  I did tweak it after the first time I made it, since we are trying to be healthier.  I used 1-1/2 cup all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat white flour.  I cut ou the white sugar, and added 1 tbs agave nectar.  Also added a few pecans, that were soaked for 10min in hot water.  My husband loved these pancakes.  Thanks!

These are the "Holy Grail" of Pancakes!!
I made them exactly as the recipe states except I spread the batter out on a lined/greased sheet pan; and baked at 425 for 12 minutes.  That way i'm not standing over the stove top attempting to make perfect circles for hours :)
I paired them with Cinnamon Syrup also from All Recipes.

I added a little vanilla and some maple syrup (the real stuff) for some extra flavor and sweetness. I also made some with mini chocolate chips. They turned out great! I messed with the flour and milk until I got a good pancake batter consistency, and they were all perfect after I got that part down.

Delicious! Following someone else’s review I substituted orange juice and orange zest for lemon. The citrus adds a little something special. Great balance between spices and pumpkin flavor. And SO SO thick and moist!! Possibly my new favorite pancake recipe, period.

Chef John - you did it again! I followed the recipe exactly (halfing everything) except I didn't have lemon zest. They turned out great. If you like flat thin pancakes, this is not your recipe. These are thick, but light and fluffy. Just like we like them. Pure maple syrup is a nice compliment. My husband didn't use syrup but topped them with Redi Whip. Will do again!

Chef John – you never cease to amaze me! These pumpkin hotcakes are so darn good!  With the exception of pumpkin seeds, milk and veg oil, I made these to spec. Used Coconut oil and Half and Half. Had to giggle at  your comment about blocking butter haters--there's no substitute for something that good-- (and if they did a little research, they'd find out it's actually good for you food – in moderation of course).  Your aversion to combining lemon juice and milk is funny ~I'm sure you know the combination produces buttermilk! And maple syrup -homemade and hot- is the perfect topper for these lil' cakes!  I also tried  my homemade buttermilk syrup when all my maple had soaked in – – it was really good but not as special as the maple! Thanks for being such a great mentor and for another awesome recipe that will become a standard in our home! ????  You are our favorite 'go to'chef!  Blessings!!!

Swap out the milk and lemon juice for buttermilk.  Add a teaspoon of spices.  Lose the white sugar and make all 3 T. dark brown sugar for a stronger molasses flavor addition. It is VERY thick so either monitor the flour addition or add a bit of buttermilk at the end to thin it slightly.  Makes great big fluffy pancakes.  YUM!

I'd give five stars for taste, because it was very tasty. However, it was a little on the sweet side for me and had too much lemon. I found the lemon overwhelming the pumpkin flavor so it wasn't quite what I was hoping for as a pumpkin pancake, therefore only three stars. I do have to say that I've never thought of adding lemon juice or zest, so that addition took it to a whole different level of pancake than any other pumpkin pancakes I've tried. When I make them again I plan on half the lemon, to cut out the tablespoon of white sugar, and to add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. However, if you like your pancakes on the sweeter and lemony side, keep it as is, because it is delicious in its own right.

I feel a little bad rating this, as I did make changes to the recipe in order to more or less use my own batter base (see the "fluffy whole-grain pancake" recipe in my recipe box), but kept the pumpkin amounts and the spice amounts (though I had to switch lemon extract for zest, not having zest or a lemon on hand). The spice ended up being a little heavy for my taste; in particular, I am likely to back off the cinnamon by 1/4 tsp next time I try this. The interesting thing, though, was that my husband, who is in general not a fan of pancakes (he finds them over-bland and calls them "sponges"), actually liked these because they had a pretty substantial amount of flavor. Since the kids also liked them enough to snack on them all morning, we'll be having them again as we work through our stock of neck pumpkins that we picked up this fall.

A side note: fresh pumpkin puree might make a difference here--I had just baked up a couple of pumpkins two days before, so my puree was pretty high-quality. If you can get ahold of a pie pumpkin or sweeter winter squash, it would be worth roasting it up (poke holes in it, put it in a baking pan, and roast it at 350 until a fork pokes easily into it; then cut it open, scoop out the seeds and stringy bits and discard [or roast the seeds], scoop out the flesh and puree it) and using fresh puree.

A nice recipe. The pancakes we made turned out to be fairly dense instead of fluffy, but they were nice and filling. I substituted fresh raw milk and used wheat flour instead of what was suggested. I might add another quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice for a more robust flavor and a half a cup of roughly chopped pecans gave it a nice chew.

I'm a bit obsessed with pumpkin. When fall rolls around I make as many pumpkin recipes as I can find. I've made a lot of pumpkin pancakes over the years. No recipe ever stood out so I would make a different one each time. No more! This recipe is amazing! Definitely a keeper!

Finally a pumpkin pancake recipe that doesn't disappoint!  Chef John has done it again!  His blueberry muffins got the title of the best blueberry muffins ever with my son and his friends.  These pancakes will be high on our list too.  Thanks Chef John

This turned out very good.  But watch the pancakes will cook fast on the outside.

We tried this morning and everyone loved them including my picky eater.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I also added some ground flax seed.  It made the batter really thick so I thinned it out with a little extra milk and some water.  Also added some enjoy life mini chocolate chips.  Served it with real maple syrup, ground pecans and fresh blueverries.  It was very time consuming but I think next time I will use 2 frying pans.  Thanks :)

I followed the recipe as a guideline using 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. I used a cup of pumpkin pie mix which already had spices.  An easy recipe to follow and my family enjoyed them!

This was a decent pancake, but I thought the lemon zest over powered the pumpkin and spice, I will probably go back to a different recipe that I used previously.

Used butter instead of oil.  Only had one lemon so probably shy of amts but these were still yummy. Batter does not need more milk, it's a scoop batter not a pour batter, I used a small ladle. I topped with glazed walnuts.

Used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices. (Total of all other spices)  Taste reminded me of french toast.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written (I cooked them on a nonstick pan w/o any oil) and served them topped w/ butter and pure maple syrup. They are light, fluffy and flavorful!I think one of the keys to their "light, fluffiness" is whisking the dry ingredients as directed. Definately will be making these again. I think I may even adapt the pumpkin and spices into a crepe recipe and fill w/maple syrup that has been whipped into creme cheese.

These were great, although the batter was a little too thick. Next time I will add more milk. I also left out the allspice (because I didn't have any) and decreased the ginger to 1/4 tsp. (because I thought 1/2 tsp. would be too strong). Next time I will try adding nutmeg. I would encourage you to alter the spices according to your taste preferences.

I have only ever made homemade pancakes once (the Fluffy Pancakes recipe from this site) and these sounded really good. I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, and I've never used lemon zest before,  so I decided to try the recipe first this morning without going to the store.

They turned out great! It was only after we ate them and I was putting the rest of the pumpkin into tupperware that I realized I had used Pumpkin Pie Mix (pumpkin with spices already added) instead. I saw some reviewers said it had too much spice, but even after my error of using the spiced pumpkin and adding all the spices as written, I didn't feel it was too strong.

Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely be buying some lemon juice and lemon zest to try again soon!

I didn't have any lemons to zest, so I left that out, but these pancakes were absolutely delicious! Oh, and I used egg beaters and rice milk instead of regular milk, but still they came out beautifully. Fluffy and flavorful. Oh, and I didn't have allspice so I substituted clove... Thanks for the terrific easy recipe!

I followed the directions exactly, and they came out perfectly. My wife and I both loved them. The mixture was not too thick, as some people commented. I'll definitely make these again.

I just made these amazing pancakes... Super delicious!! They were fluffy and just perfect. My husband and I are lactose intolerant so we used our Fat-free Lactaid milk and we also used Splenda. We were very happy.

Delicious!  Made them exactly as recipe describes but I might try orange juice and zest next time.  Also, thinking a small pancake with a dip of pumpkin ice cream, maple syrup and crumbled bacon on top would make a great dessert!

I too agree that more milk is needed to thin the batter a bit.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how light and fluffy they still turned out.  Maple syrup just added to the fall flavors although I would have liked a bit more spice which is contrary to another review so decide for yourself whether you might enjoy more or less.

I believe there's a typo in the cook time. Sounds like maybe a typo in the amount of liquid to use too from reading other reviews.Can't wait to try this!

The pancakes were overall very tasty, but as is the same with many pumpkin dishes, the pumpkin taste was somewhat hidden. Next time, we will not add the allspice because we found that taste to be somewhat overpowering.

Very good, I was liberal with the spices and I felt like the pumpkin still came through.  I also took others advice and omitted the oil.  I used a non stick pan.

These are the best pancakes I ever had in my whole life.  I used coconut oil but I kept all other ingredients as listed.  I was tempted to try different spices but I am so glad I didn’t!  They were spot on!  Yummy!  Will do this again. Thanks tons for posting this recipe!

Tried this recipe for pumpkin pancakes.  Used real cooked pumpkin.  Had my female boxer dog, Leah, my cooking buddy right by my side.  The instructions were easy, ingredients obtainable.  Made some large ones and some small ones for Leah.  We both gobbled them up.  Next time will try apple, banana, cherries, peaches, nuts, in place of pumpkin.   Thanks for a fabulous pancake recipe.  Leah thanks you too.

Maybe I just don't like pancakes (without smothering them in syrup and butter) but these weren't bad without any toppings. I probably made the mistake of adding a little too much pumpkin puree, thinking more pumpkin can't be a bad thing. But it is. Too much pumpkin is overwhelming in something as thin and insubstantial as a pancake.

Loved it ...   fluffy and very flavourful.  I omitted the lemon zest and come to think of it, I could of omitted the sugar too ... maple syrup would of sweetened it enough.   I would make this again!!!  ... if rushed in the morning I'll mix the wet and the dry separately the night before.

I halved everything as I was only making for 2. Easy and delicious.  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice and ginger because I didn't have those ingredients on hand.  Will be making this again.

I made it.  Followed Chef John's recipe and they turned out great. Used fresh lemon for the zest and the juice.
He is my guy for recipes.  Always good tips and protocols.

The batter was very thick so I ended up putting it in my waffle maker instead of pancakes. Turned out great! Topped them with maple syrup and crushed pecans. Amazing!

These pancakes turn out perfectly every time I’ve made them.  I did add additional soy milk (both almond and soy milk substituted beautifully).  I like to freeze the pancakes and do so , with this recipe, very successfully.  Mix a little cream cheese with powdered sugar as a substitute for syrup.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly the first time and added a diced apple the second time to change it up a bit.  Apple worked well with this recipe.  Even the dog was hovering around the stove sniffing the air! A little more difficult to be able to determine when to flip than regular pancake batter as you won't see bubbles breaking,.  Highly recommended.

These perfectly-spiced pumpkin pancakes were an overwhelming brunch success. Topped with bourbon caramel sauce, walnuts, and sliced bananas . . . guests were asking for seconds.  Aerating is the secret to the fluffiest pancakes!

My family LOVED these pancakes! They were perfectly spiced, fluffy, and tender! I was out of a couple of items but I followed the recipe exactly other than these. I didn't have oil so I subbed unsweetened apple sauce, and I didn't have a lemon so I used real lemon juice and the zest from an orange. I will try lemon zest next time but the orange zest was a hit. We served these with butter and no one even asked for syrup! That says it all :-)

I love making these pancakes. The only changes I made were to use gluten free all purpose flour and non dairy milk. The pancakes are absolutely fabulous and even family members who are not gluten free love them.

This review is for the recipe without any changes. Of course you can adjust the spices and sweetness to taste, use whole grain flours, add nuts, raisins, etc. Most creative cooks will do so. This recipe adapts well to individual tastes. But the unadulterated recipe is wonderful and I give it five stars! I just made a batch this morning and served them with real maple syrup, and they were delicious. Light and fluffy, with plenty of pumpkin taste and a beautiful golden color. I make these whenever I have leftover squash on hand, and honestly, I make sure to bake extra just for the pancakes. We especially love the little delicate squash from our farmer's market,  and one of those makes just about one cup, perfect for a batch of pumpkin pancakes for Sunday brunch!

I agree 100% with this reviewer "Flavor was good; however, as previously mentioned, batter was way too thick and pancakes would not cook in the middle before burning on the outside." I'm going to try again and thin it out more with some additional milk.

My 2 year old liked this recipe. I halved the whole thing and did not use anything to do with lemons because I didn't have 1 on hand. Half the recipe yielded 5 1/2 cup pancakes. I did not think they were too spiced.

They were good.  But, my kids did think they were too spicy and not sweet enough. It didn't stop them from eating them. But, next time I will play around with the ingredients.

These were okay. They didn't really taste like pumpkin though. I made these with whole wheat flour, and used bottled lemon juice (ran out of lemons), and served them with walnuts and maple syrup. The texture of the pancakes was really nice, but I wouldn't make these again. I prefer a really distinct pumpkin flavour.

Made these for my sister. She said she loved them. I tasted a piece of one, not too interested in pumpkin pancakes myself, and they were fluffy. I thought maybe a little more pumpkin flavor needed, but she was happy. She made cinnamon whipped cream and also found honey butter. Will make for her again.

I made this according to the recipe . (Except we were out of baking soda-oops).
They were still very good -a great intro to Fall. Next time I might reduce the amount of allspice, but will definitely make them again.

These were really good and quite different. They had a good, meaty texture. I followed the recipe exactly. The lemon was noticeable, different, but a good addition.

I was really hopeful for this recipe, but it didn't meet expectations. I followed the directions carefully, making no modifications. My first pancake was so thick that it didn't even come close to cooking inside. I added more milk, at least 1/4 c, to make the batter a little thinner. They cooked a little better, but the texture was still gummy. Flavor was ok, and great with maple syrup on top, but I have had better. I used to make a killer recipe out of bisquick (which I now avoid, preferring to make things from scratch) but will have to keep looking for a new recipe.

So yummy!  I studied the reviews and borrowed some ideas: subbed 1/4 C whole wheat flour for AP, subbed orange juice and zest for lemon (so good!), subbed almond milk for the other milk and added 1/4 C more after cooking one test pancake, added freshly ground nutmeg.  Served with good maple syrup and they were like a burst of autumn in my mouth!  Now, others reported that their husbands raved, but mine did not.  When I asked if I should make them again, he said he's of the opinion that pumpkin is for pie.  Period.

Followed the recipe to par and when it looked too thick I added more milk as others suggested. I'm no stranger to the kitchen and rarely make anything that could be considered 'bad' but these lacked so much. Thick, poor texture, barely any spice flavoring (or even regular flavor for that fact).

The batter was very thick which led to the outside cooking too much and the inside being mushy and under-cooked. I've made pancakes from scratch many times but this recipe was pretty disappointing considering how good it sounds. I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe either so I don't understand the high ratings.

I made these following the recipe exactly. First of all, they were edible. But...They were very heavy and spongy.  The flavor was okay but not really special like I expected. I am looking for another recipe for my file.

These had great flavor!!!  I had some frozen "fresh" pumpkin that I used  and it defrosted kind of watery.  I think that is what made these a thinner batter than normal  Still fantastic though, the whole family enjoyed them for sure :)  5 stars!

Great pancakes! I used all the listed ingredients minus the lemon zest (didn't have one) and I added a little extra milk to get he batter to my desired consistency. I cooked them in a non-stick skillet, so no extra oil needed. They came out fluffy and wonderful. Definitely would make again.

Super delicious, but super thick. Needed to add more milk. Will make again and possibly add a little more oil to see how it works out. Used Shortening in a non-stick pan. Works great for getting that great crispy edge.

I've made these twice.  The first time I didn't have lemon zest, and boy I noticed the difference when I made it the second time.  These pancakes are AMAZING! But you must use the lemon zest.  I didn't have quite as much as it called for about 1.5 teaspoons.  Everyone raved about them.  I also used whole wheat flour with a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten instead of regular flour.  Perfect!

The pancakes came out really great, just as the recipe describes. I also added pumpkin spice for some extra spice, but that was a personal preference. The kids loved it too!

I do not like lemon zest so I left that out and used flax meal egg replacement, and whole grains in place of the all-purpose flour, but otherwise the same ingredients.  And it was great!  The whole family liked it, except my dad who doesn't care for pumpkin stuff.  I loved them, so did my hubby and two kids!  I will definitely make again (when my dad isn't around!)!!

These are delicious.  I made them healthier by using oat flour, soy milk, coconut oil and adding about a 1/4 cup of ground flax seed.  Thanks!

My daughter said she wanted a pumpkin roll for breakfast on the first day of Fall. LOL. So... I made these instead. I did take the liberty of using homemade pumpkin puree and only had 1 lemon to zest = 1tsp lemon zest.  Also, I added a cinnamon swirl while cooking. Finally, I topped with a cream cheese glaze. I know. A lot of modifications but the pancake by itself was still very good.

I just made these tonight and we loved them!   The batter was thick, as others have said, but I just spread them out a touch.  They were really nice and fluffy.  The pumpkin flavor was a it on the lighter side, but I will definitely make these again.  My husband asked me to save this recipe for next time!

Sooo good!  Very moist and delicious.  My kids even loved them. My son asked if I would be rating them, and added "only if you give it 5 stars"!

Flavor and texture were perfect.  I used skim milk and these were amazing - probably the best I've ever had pancakes turn out.  Great recipe.

These were delicious!  The perfect amount of pumpkin flavor.  I did add about a half cup more of milk because we like them thinner.

This recipe is good but we used pumpkin pie spice in stead of all the spices. It came out kind of bitter. But I love it with my Dad's syrup?? Mona age 7

I followed this recipe to a T.  I made them for my hubby's birthday breakfast and everyone loved them.  I didn't have a problem with the mixture or dry to liquid ingredients.  My only problem was beating off my family as they kept trying to steal the pancakes before they were done.  I will keep this recipe - it's a winner.

The pancakes are floppy whether I cook them in oil or butter, on high heat or low heat. There is also nowhere near enough salt, and they definitely need more milk.

I made these today exactly as stated.  I have to say that they were excellent.  Very light and fluffily.  You definitely have to whip up the flour mixture for the said two minutes.  I really feel that this is the clue to making these pancakes so fantastic.  I will for sure be making these time and time again.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you Chef John

I really liked this recipe!  Did not have veg oil, used coconut oil instead.  Increasing the milk a bit helped make it less thick.  Too think and they don't cook through properly.  They're almost like little gingerbread pancakes!  Love them.  Wanted to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option.  Thanks for a fun fall treat!

Yum yum yum!!! Def needed a little more milk bc the batter was very thick. These were fantastic! I used a little less sugar and brown sugar. I love how the spices don't overwhelm the taste of the pumpkin... Delicious!

These were delicious!! I used my mini pancake pan & made approximately 25 nice fluffy minis. I used coconut oil as my oil and didn't  bother w/ the lemon zest.  This is saved to my Recipe Box & I plan to make more & freeze them.

It had a strange aftertaste. My kids did not like them at all and one of them is a big fan of pumpkin and pancakes. My husband said they were okay but not worth making again!

Tried it. Love them,  though I did make some changes. Like some said definitely more liquid. Quite a bit more. The spicing is a personal preference thing. I did not have allspice on hand and I really enjoyed it that way. I was silly and did not finely grate the zest. Make sure you do. I used lemon but plan to try orange. I used half white half wheat and thought it was great. I bet could be adjusted for gluten free or Paleo maybe. Oh, I used half the sugar cause I planned on maple syrup on top. Glad I did it that way.

Delicious. I usually try a recipe w/o changes the first time. Yesterday mom n I had these for the first time, left overs today. Cook once, eat twice. A little Norm Abram in there. I wouldn't change anything. We used lite syrup, for both our sakes. Super enjoy your recipes and Videos Chef John. Now that I'm at home taking care of my mom there's more time to explore the recipe world. Thank You Chef for all the great eats and God Bless

Very tasty! I used whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white flour and it was still nice and fluffy.  The lemon zest is a nice touch.  I'd like to try using orange zest next time.  Tasted great with maple syrup.

I thought these were great! I only used a dash or two of allspice and used cloves instead because I don't care for allspice in my pumpkin pie-spiced foods, and I used whole wheat flour instead of white, but otherwise followed all directions exactly and they turned out delicious! Definitely thick, but that's how I like my pancakes. Next time, though, I would add more cinnamon.

I love this recipe!  I hate pancakes, but these are amazing.  The first time I tried them I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful.  The second time I tried substituting pancake mix instead and it was still good, but following the recipe to a T is the best way to go.  Definitely worth the time and effort!

I'm not a big fan of pancakes, but for so long though pumpkin pancakes sounded good. With some left-over pumpkin on hand, I decided to give them a try. I thought these were fantasitc - light, fluffy, and not soggy. I think the level of spices are on par with pumpkin pie, so if that's what you like no adjustments are necessary. I stored the left-overs in the refrigerator and warmed them up in the microwave and they were quite acceptable.

Awesome base recipe. Since I didn't have much time I shaved off a little time by starting with Original Aunt Jemima pancake mix. I cut out the flour, white sugar, baking soda and baking powder. Instead of the seperate spices, I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. I used the lemon zest, but not the lemon juice. They were super yummy and light.  My daughter's thirteen year old sleepover friends seemed to really enjoy them. Great recipe Chef John. Thanks for sharing.

These were good.  Not sure that they were SO good that they made it worth the effort.  I had no lemon zest so I had to skip it, and I didn't realize till after that I'd totally forgotten the ginger. :(  Sad.  I did NOT think these were spicy at all (but I did forget the ginger).  I would definitely put more spice in next time.  I think buttermilk would do something for these also, maybe I'll try next time.  Anyways, they tasted pretty fantastic with some real Vermont maple syrup, but any pancakes taste pretty good with that stuff on 'em.

These pancakes were delicious!! I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the ones shown and skipped the lemon zest as well. They cook up very moist which we loved! These don't even need syrup - a little butter and they are perfect!!

This had really good flavor but was a little bit dense. i'll definitely make it again, but will use some kind of leavening trick to give it a little more poof. still tasty!

I used buttermilk instead of milk with lemon...but that wont change the flavor any since milk and lemon is the old standby for buttermilk. I found the spice to be a little strong and cut the ginger allspice in half.  Lastly as noted by other posters....the batter is very thick and I had to add more liquid for a pourable batter. All minor stuff though.

These pancakes were super yummy! My whole family loved them. I was unsure about the lemon juice and zest, but it gave the pancakes a nice flavor that complemented the pumpkin and spices.  The batter was a little thick for my preference so I added more milk to the consistancy that I like.  Will definely make again.

These were good enough, but not great. I tried one plain before adding any syrup. They had very little flavor. I'm not talking subtle, I'm talking very little flavor. I'm going to try these again, will probably double the spices, and add more pumpkin. I'll post a review again if that works.  However, I made apple cider syrup using brown sugar instead of white, and it was delicious with these pancakes.

Chef John was right! These are so easy to make and they were delicious. We didn't have any lemons, so I just used lime juice and they still turned out fantastic. I topped mine with pecans. My husband and I really enjoyed them and I will definitely be making them again. It was a perfect Saturday fall morning breakfast.

Well 5 stars for flavor. That lemon really makes for a delicate fine tasting pancake! I put a little too much liquid and made an ugly mess that delighted the taste buds. This is the best pumpkin pancake recipe I've found.

I followed this recipe exactly but my pancakes were a disaster.  Theories?  My guess is that my baking powder has lost its oomph, which has never happened to me before.  I used almond milk because I had nothing else.  I've used that before in pancakes without any problems but does anyone know a reason why it might ruin this particular recipe.  I'm open to and entertaining all explanations.  To make things even worse, I made a double batch...

I agree that the spice balance is a little off, too overpowering in some and it kind of washes out a lot of the pumpkin, but I feel the same way about some pumpkin pie recipes.
I'll tweak it a bit and find a balance I like. :)

The batter was definitely thick, I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of milk. I also used all brown sugar and 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I made a sample pancake and had to bump up the spices considerably. An extra tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon as well. I thought they were just OK. Husband not a fan at all. In the end I wish I had added some walnuts or pecans or something. I was disappointed I really wanted to like them.

I gave it 4 stars only because I think you need to add a little more milk.  I added at least a 1/2 cup more to make them not so thick.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. vanilla just because i like the flavor.  And I guess to make them a "bit" more healthy, instead of the vegetable oil, I added applesauce.  Other then that, i loved them.  So did my hubby who is picky about pancakes.

The spices were a bit strong.  Also, the middle stayed mushy.  Unfortunately, they really weren't worth the effort.

I had saved this recipe to make for my family and when I woke up this morning I didn't really feel like cooking. So, I sort of followed it. I used instant pancake mix (Aunt Jemima Original Instant) and added the pumpkin, allspice, and cinnamon. My kids loved it! One of our neighbors girls was over and said they were awesome! They said it would have been even better with whipped cream.
