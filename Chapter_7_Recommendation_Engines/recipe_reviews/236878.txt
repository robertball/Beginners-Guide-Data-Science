Great recipe.  But I recommend adding garlic to the veggies and extra mozzarella to the layers.

I doubled the sauce ingredients and added garlic salt in place of regular salt  for extra flavor, used zucchini/yellow squash/mushrooms along with the package of frozen spinach in the recipe.  I made it the night before I was serving. When it came time to bake, I put it uncovered in oven in order to take the chill off the dish as the oven preheated. Baked it approximately 40 minutes until top was nicely browned. 
I made this for the birthday meal for my 92-year old mother.  She was very pleased. It was good but I think I will add some spaghetti sauce to the top for added flavor when I reheat .

While it was good it needed more sauce and flavour. I loved the vegetables though! But not sure if we would try this recipe again.

This is awesome. A nice change of pace from the typical red sauce lasagna. The only thing wrong with it was my own error: I used no bake noodles that never softened up all the way. If I ever use no-bake noodles again, I will parboil them first.

This is the best white lasagna I have ever had. May never go back to the tomato-meat one again. No change to recipe, just used an oval dish. Deliciousness!

In place of the broth I used tomato juice. Used 5 cheese in place of the mozzerello. Added a little eggplant and onions. I felt like it was missing something maybe minced garlic. We topped with spaghetti sauce. I will make again useing some garlic
