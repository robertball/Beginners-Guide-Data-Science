This was the first time using my Air Fryer, and they came out pretty good.  I would make the slices at least 1/2 inch wide because the breading masked too much of the onion flavor.

Wont make it again. Batter did not stick to the onion rings and made them hard to bread. Split the rings (quantity) and did half with standard bread crumbs. They turned out better. The battering process was also extremely messy.

Will experiment a bit with flavors and bread crumbs, but crispy.  A little bit of a pain to batter and bread but the result is worth it!
