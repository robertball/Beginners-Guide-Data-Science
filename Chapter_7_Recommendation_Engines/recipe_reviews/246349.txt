I've been making this for years, with one exception. I don't use the seasoning packet at all (the beef seasoning makes a great base for homemade sour-cream/onion dip) and throw in a handful of shredded cheese (cheddar or swiss usually).

I love this idea as a college student. I think all the ingredients that make up this dish of one serving total to less than $1. I can feed myself dinner quick and easy . Since eggs come in dozens, Ramen comes in dozens x 2, and only half an onion is used my limited food resources aren't totally usurped. The less trips to the store the better!

I really loved it.
I omitted the extra salt as so many people have mentioned and add some parmesan cheese.
This is going to be my new easy-peasy-lazy dinner.

Fun and delicious! The only change that I would make next time is to use just a little less of the seasoning packet (I used chicken flavored ramen). Other than that, this was totally different, comforting and yummy! Thanks for sharing. :)

Love it! Made it for myself and my partner and it was amazing. Only modification is when boiling the noodles, add the seasoning the boiling water so the noodles cook with it instead of adding after.

Made this for the first time for the family. Nice addition to the breakfast repertoire. Next time around might reduce amount of seasoning and add some sweet peppers.

Made this as a snack and it was devoured. What a great recipe for ramen and what a great way to add some protein.

This is a tasty, quick, and inexpensive meal.  I used shallots instead of onions because that's what I had.

Loved this recipe. I added cayenne pepper, mushroom, bacon bits, and cheese. My husband who doesn’t like mushroom and onion loved this! And I loved that it didn’t taste dry. I thought it was going to since it looked dry and it wasn’t. I also love that this recipe is flexible and you can add whatever you want.

I found this recipe yesterday and decided to make it for myself today. So easy and so good. My husband tried stealing it from me.  Next time I will make a double batch and consider sharing!

Didn't have onions, wish I had scallions. Added frozen peas and soy sauce. My mom used to make it like this! Delish!

I made this because I wanted to do something different with eggs and my spouse LOVES noodles. This was pretty blah. And kind of confusing to eat.(I wish I could explain that better.) Maybe a little heat/spice would help. Adding hot sauce at the table seemed to add some excitement...but I doubt I will make this one again. Unless I return to those days when ramen was all I could afford.

I didn't really have the noodle flavouring so I used some sesame oil, chilli sauce, soy sauce and garem masala.

Turned out really well, a minute or two in the wok and it was done :D

Delicious and couldn’t be more easy to prepare. I added some diced tomatoes with the onion and a splash of hot sauce. Yums:)!

I'm not sure why I like this, but I do though it's hard to figure out exactly how much seasoning is 'just right'. I like it with a handful of shredded cheddar as others have mentioned. I think I just feel like it's so unhealthy (and salty), otherwise I'd really love it. Will have to make it for the hubby and see what he thinks.

This is amazing and I wish  I thought of it! Toss that packet that comes with the ramen, you don't need it! Season yourself to your liking.

I've made this a few times, and it's really good
I used 3 eggs and a spash of milk instead of water and I think it turned out better.

Ok the concept of this recipe was great, but I changed it a bit...  Mostly because of the salt.... Instead of Ramen noodles I used 3 nest of tagliatelle noodles.   I cooked noodles then added them to my sauté onions added a small squeeze of ginger two tablespoons of cream of spinach (leftover from the night before) moved everything to the side and scrambled one extra large egg.  Once egg scrambled I stirred everything in the skillet.  Once plated I added a dash of Parmesan.  Total time 20 minutes.  Great fast one person meal.  I plan on doubling ingredients to fix it for my 7 year old.

I added some thyme pepper and salt and used sweet onions. I also put cheese in it and used some of the broth from earlier... it tasted awesome. I added more of the seasonings because I like seasoned foods and it turned out great.

I like to put all the ingredients in with the egg except the seasoning packet and after I poor in the egg sprinkle the seasoning on little at a time. ( poor a little, mix, poor a little more and mix)

I gave this recipe a high rating because of how easy it is to make and it taste decent. I wouldn't add the pinch of salt. I believe the noodle seasoning adds  enough salt. Plus you can always add more salt later if needed. Also, I love onions but in my opinion a half onion is little too much.

Fours stars for the ease of preparation. Next time might try adding additional vegetables.
