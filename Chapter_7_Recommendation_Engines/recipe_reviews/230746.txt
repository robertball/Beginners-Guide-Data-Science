This was excellent.  The first time I made this I was able to get fresh oysters here on the gulf coast.  Couldn't find Pernod so went with an anise flavored liquor.  Second time couldn't find fresh oysters so used a quart of shucked.  Made the butter mixture the same and improvised.  Toasted some homemade french bread using EVOO since plenty of butter in the mix.  Then I took medium sized ramekins and placed like 4-5 oysters in those using a little bit of the oyster liquor then topped with the butter mixture.  Cooked them at the same temperature for same amount of time.  Gave everyone their own ramekin and slices of toasted french bread, just spoon on top of the bread and wow, it is also awesome.  Next time I am thinking that I might try doing them in the same way you make creme broulee or flan, putting the ramekins in boiling water in the oven so it is more poaching I guess.  Will let y'all know how that turns out.  Thanks as always Chef John.

I have never seen oysters Rockefeller look like this...ever! I have been to many New Orleans restaurants, and not once did they present me with a dish that looked like this.
Loose the 'green' stuff like tarragon, and other green tidbits, and cover with spinach. Yes, spinach, the frozen kind that you squeeze out before applying. Voila!
Bake at 350 degrees until bubbly on top and you have a world famous dish.

Very nice flavor!  I watched the video first, and it was most helpful.  I used 24 oysters and ran out of the beautiful topping.  Next time I make this I must remember to adjust the amount for the topping--it is so good!

These are really, really, really good. I did make a few changes since I was looking to make something with oysters using ingredients I already had on hand. I substituted spinach for the watercress, and a dry white wine for the anise flavored liquor. I also pre-cooked the oysters by putting them on a grill until the popped open. I then put the topping on top, added a bit of mozzarella cheese on top, and broiled them for until the cheese was lightly browned.
