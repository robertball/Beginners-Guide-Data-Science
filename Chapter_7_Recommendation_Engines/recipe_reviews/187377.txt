This is very good bread, though I found the dough VERY sticky and had to add quite a bit more flour to get it workable. I used green greek olives and added some sundried tomatoes  at the submitter's suggestion. I think I would use darker olives next time so you can see them better. We had this with greek lamb stew, which went really nicely. I'm going to use the second loaf for muffeletta sandwiches - yum! Thanks for the recipe!

bake at 350. Not 450. My bread was "done" in twenty minutes. I think next time I'll try 350 instead. Good flavor, wowweeee does it make a lot of bread. These are giant loaves! Next time I'll make 4 smaller loaves instead of 2 bigees.

I halfed the recipe as the original recipe makes A LOT of bread.  I also would decrease the oven temp as it took less than 40 minutes for my bread to cook at 450.  Otherwise, great recipe - I've done it twice with the options (tomato, rosemary, etc) and it has turned out great!

Nice recipe, went as per original recipe but I think next time I will try adding sun-dried tomatoes.

Great bread recipe, first time managed to have perfectly baked bread without raw inside!
