My daughter made these for her guests at her 10th birthday party. They held their shape, didn't puff, tasted delicious! Easy enough for a 9 year old to do totally by herself. We will make these again. the bunnies were so cute!

Very good! The orange taste is different. I used orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice, and reduced the zest to 2 teaspoons and they turned out fine. I was afraid the dough would have to be refrigerated, but it was easy to handle straight out of the mixing bowl.

I used salted butter instead of shortening and ommitted the orange zest, which I did not have.  My 6-year-old daughter and I made these and rolled them out into different shapes using small plastic play-dough cutters, then baked them for 8 minutes  They rolled out well without refrigeration and held their shape nicely during baking.  We made a small batch and put the rest of the dough away for tomorrow.  I can't review the taste, because my daughter ate them all while I was tidying up!

Delicious and fast sugar cookie! The orange flavor is yummy- i put orange cream frosting on mine and cut them thicker to make them softer. My dough ended up being too dry, so I just kept adding orange juice until I could roll them out!

I tried making a half batch. I only needed a 24 or 36 batch of cookies, but I got very bad results... the dough was very crumbly and rolled out like a pastry dough.  After cooked, it was a little tough (ok with a hot drink), and you couldn't taste much flavour.  I do like the idea of this recipe as an Easter Cookie... We get a little tired of the standard sugar cookies right after christmas.

Really good sugar cookies! I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup (but I changed the servings to 36 because I only wanted to use Â½ cup of margarine) and I used one very large egg. I omitted the red hots, and I glazed the cookies with a glaze consisting of icing sugar and orange juice. My three-year old then went crazy with the Easter-themed sprinkles. :) The orange was a nice change, and the lesser amount of sugar made them less sweet enough that my husband (not a fan of sweets) enjoyed. Thanks so much for sharing, Carol!

This is a great recipe for cut-out cookies.  The cookies retains the design from the cutter beautifully.  The cut cookie also comes out of the cutter with no difficulty.  They taste great too.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks

This was a nice change from the usual sugar cookie recipe! I made it exactly as directed, with the exception of lemon zest instead of orange (it was all I had).The orange juice gave a pleasant but not overpowering flavor, which is what sets it apart. It is also very convenient in that the dough does not need to be chilled. The dough appeared dry in the mixing bowl, but then when I picked it up and squished it together it was able to roll out nicely (you have to be more careful with the cutout shapes though because they are more likely to fall apart than ones made from other doughs). We weren't big fans of the RedHots though- they just don't seem to go well with sugar cookies. And these cookies definitely taste better frosted! Thank you for the recipe- I will definitely make them again.

Came out great, but a little firm to taste. I didn't have oj so just squeezed what I could from an orange and then used the zest--may have needed more liquid.

Yummy~!
this was my first sugar cookie.  A hint of orange was so yummy.  Plus this is nice and soft, but not too soft.  I'm giving this 4 just so that i have room just in case if there is anything better.

Fine sugar cookie.  A little more crunchy, less soft consistency than some other recipes.  We frosted ours and the orange flavor didn't come through at all.  Basically I'd say a regular sugar cookie recipe, nothing extraordinary.

Had to add some more orange juice to the recipe to make it hold together, other than that, my 9yo son and I had fun putting this one in the oven for Easter cookies. His classmates should be happy with him tomorrow! Thanks!

This was a good recipe for a roll out cookie. I used them for valentine's day hearts. I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to add a couple more tablespoons of orange juice at the end to make the dough come together. They baked up nicely and had a nice texture, though slightly lacking in flavor. I iced them and topped that with colored sugar for a wonderful treat.

This is a great recipe! However, the dough seemed to be quite dry. I added another couple splashes of orange juice and then it was perfect to work with. Also made the cookies a little thicker and baked for 9 1/2 minutes so they have a crunchy edge but very soft too. For the icing I suggest making a simple icing with powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. I used 2 1/2 cups (one box) powdered sugar, about 7-8 tablespoons 1% milk, and approximately 2 tsp vanilla. Measure the vanilla to taste. You want the consistency to be slightly thin at first (but not dripping off the cookie) as the icing will start to thicken. Overall very easy to make and can be used for tons of cute cookie ideas!

I made this for my family and everyone simply LOVE it, including grandma and grandpa. I replaced shhortenings with unsalted butter and it was just fine. I actually reduced white sugar to 1 cup and might reduce it a little bit more next time. The orange flavor is wonderful. I added probably 4 teaspoons last time and it was better than following the recipe as 2 1/2 tsp. More flavor. I love this recipe and I'll pass it onto my friends.

I also made them a little thicker for a shortbread type cookie.  For a preschooler's craft, we cut out large hearts to paste together (with the point of the top heart touching the dip in the bottom heart)with royal icing and decorate as Valentine Bears. They were tasty and pretty.

Such good cookies! Although they can get a little tough, they're great for cut outs since they don't spread! I also like that they're not too sweet either! I added a touch more OJ and used orange extract instead of zest (1 to 1 ratio) and they turned out great!
