Very quick and very tasty. We don't add extracted oils or fats if we can avoid it at all. But these probably would be hockey pucks if we didn't add some, so we put in a tablespoon of Earth Balance and skipped the coconut oil. We loved them. Maybe not as fluffy as with all the fat, but tasty none the less. We made half plain and added a teaspoon of dry rosemary to the other half. Both were great, but the rosemary ones were fabulous. Next time making all with rosemary.

I added the photo of my biscuits to the top of the page, since none had yet been uploaded.  These biscuits were fantastic.  I used olive oil but otherwise followed the original recipe.  (I do prefer to use my fingers to rub the ingredients rather than a fork.)  They were light and amazingly fluffy. Absolutely delicious.  As FYI, I used Wegman's  unbleached white whole wheat flour.  Bag says 100% whole wheat but certainly baked up like white flour.

Great, quick and easy biscuits! I used 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 1/2 cup flax meal and added a palmful of nutritional yeast. Super yum with my vegan gravy! Thanks!

These were very light and fluffy. I actually used regular milk because I don't have almond milk, but it still turned out good.This was surprisingly easy recipe. For me, it made a lot more than just 10 biscuits

I make these about 3 times a month and i always add some vegan cheese shreds and red pepper flakes! So good! Sometimes Iâ€™ll use several different types of cheese. This time i used daiya pepper jack and farmhouse cheddar!!! Sooooooo yummy. Highly recommend these.

Next time I'll use 3T butter & 1T coconut oil or use olive oil in place of coconut oil. They had more smell of coconut than taste, but it wasn't super appealing with what we were eating.

Good texture and rise.  Unfortunately,  didn't really care for the vegetable/coconut oil flavor.  But it was much more healthy than using butter, so will probably make again.

Excellent, easy, quick. They bake up light, fluffy, and melt-in-your-mouth tasty. An instant favourite and one I will come back to since I'm dairy free.

Didn't have coconut oil on hand so used olive oil and used non-vegan butter. Very nice little biscuit. Will be great with a meal. Not a strong wheat flavor so could easily be "doctored up" with herbs or could be lightly sweetened. Will definitely make a lot of these in the future.

I was hosting a brunch for friends, some of whom are vegan, so I decided to try these out. I did substitute vanilla soy milk for almond milk because I have a friend who is allergic to all nuts. They didn't have much shape, and many people thought they were "breakfast cookies." I think the texture turned out pretty good, but if I make them again, I will definitely be adding something to give them more flavor because these were really bland.

Very easy to make. I add some nutritional yeast and even my picky son-in-law likes these. Have made them for breakfast, brunch and dinner. They taste great served warm with maple syrup or honey.

Perfect!  Very close to KFC biscuits. I used white instead of wheat flour. This would be perfect for pie or pizza crust as well since it clumped easily after mixing. Thanks for this easy recipe!

One of my children is allergic to dairy, so this is just what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly and now have perfect, flavorful biscuits.  The kids love'em!  Thanks.
