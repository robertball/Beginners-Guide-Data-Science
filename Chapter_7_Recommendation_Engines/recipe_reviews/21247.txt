I served these potatoes with the chicken fried chicken from this site, and they were delicious!  I'm not a big fan of anything lemon, but my mom and grandma were visiting, so I decided to make these because it seemed like something they would like.  I ended up loving them, too!  I used Morton's Nature Seasoning, and I only had bottled lemon juice, so that's what I used.  I was surprised that the lemon really added such a good flavor.  These will be a regular at my house!

I thought this turned out very well.  I mixed up everything "shake n bake" style in a large ziploc bag and it turned out nicely.  I added some finely chopped garlic and sprinkled parsley on the potatoes before baking.

I tried these potatoes and they turned out pretty good, but I would recommend using a nonstick cookie tray sprayed with pam instead of foil(I used one of each and the nonstick tray browned the potatoes perfectly compared to the other tray with foil)

These were great! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I thinly sliced a small onion and tossed them over the potatoes.  I also added some oregano and seasoning salt for a little extra flavor. P.S. Always use FRESH lemon juice.  It does make a difference!

These were easy to make. I drizzled them with Olive oil instead of vegetable, and sprinkled them with seasoned salt. They were pretty tasty!

Maybe because I used real lemon juice rather than bottled, but these didn't have much in the way of flavor.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic, but that didn't appear to make much of a difference.  If I try this again I will have to add some addition spices for flavor.

I thought these were just OK for me. Too much lemon flavor. My daughter said "your fries are not so good mommy" So I doubt we'll have these again.

We used potatoes we received from the CSA instead of baking potatoes. Instead of vegetable oil we used canola oil. Also used sea salt and fresh ground pepper. After they were done baking we topped them with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Tasted really good. We will be making them again.

I would definitely recommend using olive oil rather than vegetable oil since in my opinion would be the only thing that would make one want to bake them rather than fry them, to safe the fat content. I also sub'ed the salt and pepper for a no salt seasoning from Costco that has many other herbs and spices in it. The citrus gives it a nice variation.

My family loves this recipe.  Even my 2 yr old eats them.  I make these about once a week!  Very Good. I agree they do need some seasonings though, seasoned salt is good.

This is the way I have always made my steak fries. I top them with grated cheese (and melt), crumbled bacon and serve with ranch dressing! YUM! Thank you!

In Bruxelles, we have small potatoes, so this works well to make them taste better. Mashed potatoes just don't work with the potatoes I have to work with.  I made this once for my hubby and he liked them so much I have made them every week for six months.  I don't really notice the difference in putting lemon juice or not, so I don't now.   Definitely a staple!

I cut the potatoes into thin fries and par boiled them for about 4 minutes before tossing with the oil and lemon juice.  Added a few shakes of seasoned salt and oregano.  Very good.  (Even though I boiled the potatoes to give them a head start, I had to bake them much longer - maybe 15 minutes more - to get them as crispy as I like.)

I've made this recipe twice. The first time it came out perfect, the second time i used too many potatoes and they didn't get crispy enough. Both times i added cayenne pepper which to me made them extremely good, however the recipe as is deserves five stars.

Here are my reasons for 3 stars: 1) raw potatoes are extremely difficult to cut and require more prep time and 2) At the 20 minutes mark when I turned the wedges over they were ALL very soft and I knew the baking time/temp wasn't right. I baked them for 5 minutes more while I heated up vegetable oil in a pan. Then, I fried the fries for about 5 minutes and topped off with some Kosher salt. YUM!

Wonderful! I used about 4 medium potatoes - chopped with the fry cutter on large blade.  I splashed a small amount of the lemon juice into the ziploc bag and didn't even taste it. We cooked these on 400 for about 32 minutes and they were just a little crunchy and soft in the middle, probably could have went 40 minutes for a little more crunch.  Granted it's more time consuming than the frozen stuff, but it's worth it!

These were good, but I was kind of (maybe unrealistically) expecting them to turn out just like french fries and they weren't quite like that.  Next time maybe I'll try cooking them at a higher heat to see if that gets them any crisper.

These didn't taste like they had even a hint of lemon, but they were good potato wedges anyway. I followed the directions except I used a nonstick baking sheet prepped with cooking spray.

We loved these potatoes.  I used olive oil with the lemon juice and the color of the potatoes was super.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  It is simple and makes a nice addition to an ordinary potato.

These were okay; I would say better than some but not the best! I put garlic salt on them to add a little flavor but I think some more seasonings are in order.

great kick off recipe and the cooking time was right on.  I didn't have any lemons so I squeezed an entire lime into my ovoo & seasoning salt.  I think the lime (and probably the lemon) give these fries a little, unexpected kick.  Gobbled up in no time!  Thanks!

This works. It also lets me do another dish under the broiler while these finish, or just to keep them hot.

Very disappointing.  Too much lemon flavor and they didn't brown at all.  It's possible I cut the wedges too large, but regardless we didn't like this at all.

I just couldn't see where the lemon really added anything to these potatoes. But I really like lemon, so I think I will try this again and add the lemon after bringing them out of the oven, as a different way of doing things, and see how that turns out. Thanks for posting!

These oven fries were very tasty, the best I've made in several attempts over the years!  I used bottled lemon juice (the kind that comes in the squeezy lemon), olive oil, and Creole Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  They were a bit spicy, just the way we like them.  (My hubby suggested cooking them a bit longer, but he doesn't like them soft on the inside the way I do.) In any event, they disappeared quickly and I will be making them again!

Quick and easy,and very good.Baking at a high heat keeps the outside crispy and the inside was incredibly soft and good. I added some "Steakhouse" seasoning(the kind you get at the grocery store) and sprinkled that on the potatoes before putting them in the oven.The family loved them.

I thought this was a quick and easy change from regular baked potatoes.  I used citrus flavoured sea salt to punch it up a bit and fresh lemon juice is a must!  I used a 475 oven, they came out nice and crispy.

Easy and very tasteful.  I did adjust by cooking some bacon and onion  to crumble into mixture, a few apple slices and a touch of chili powder. After bakcing, added shredded cheese as topping and broiled to get nice crisp topping.

These were ok. Nothing exciting, but not bad either. I probably wouldn't make this exact recipe again because I like more spices on my oven-fried potatoes to make up for the lack of french-fried flavor. I thought the recipe called for a little more oil than is strictly necessary (the finished product had an oily feel to it) and the "salt and pepper to taste" is pretty vague. I used 1/2 tsp. for a doubled recipe (of each).

This is a fabulous recipe for those watching their fat intake. I like the lemony flavour and only added a sprinkling of sea salt once they were cooked. I started off baking them, but perhaps because I did not use tin foil, they did not brown quickly enough for my liking, so I turned on the grill function and they were DELICIOUS! Thanks for a healthy version of a favourite.

I used 2 large potatoes for 2 people. Very easy to make and good but imo this recipe needs more kick.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and it still was just ok.  Next time I would add another tbsp of lemon and more of all the seasonings above.

It was my first time making oven fried potatoes and I love it!!!  The lemon juice it did gave it a wonderful flavor. I decided to add dried thyme to add more flavor to it. My kids love it! :-D I will definitely make it again. Besides is healthier than deep fried french fries. Thank you for sharing your recipe Pnylli. God bless...

These were very good!!  I did use more lemon juice and used a seasoned salt.  I also raised the temp to 450
For  the last 10 mins. I wanted them to brown more. Great flavor!  Definitely will make them again.

I tried this and just changed a few things to use what was on hand.  I used olive oil cooking spray and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also used key lime juice instead of lemon.  The potatoes turned out delicious-I was surprised they were so tasty.  I plan on making these again soon.
