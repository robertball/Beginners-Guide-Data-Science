5.5.16   The recipe doesn’t say what to do with the pecans...by all means, chop them.  I substituted Splenda® Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar, and used Egg Beaters® for the eggs in an effort to make the muffins a bit more in tune with our diet.  Both subs worked well.  Used a small cookie scoop for the filling the muffin cups, and I topped each muffin with a pecan half before going into the oven.  They  baked perfectly at 12 mins, and I ended up with 24 mini muffins, exactly what the recipe indicated.  Christie, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed these mini muffins.

I use 1 rounded tablespoon per cup.  If they overflow, the sugar burns and looks bad.  I do add a pecan half to the top sometimes; but if I make a triple batch I skip that. This is one of my most requested recipes. Bonus: they freeze beautifully. These are very sweet, just like Pecan Pie. If you don't like very sweet things, don't make it.

These, by far, have been the best muffins I have ever cooked. The batter was so creamy, they were a perfect size, and the ratio of the amount of batter to pecans was just perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and while they tasted good they were a disaster! They became hollow in the center and spread all over the top of my pan. I ended up scraping it into bowls. While the flavor was good I’ll never use this recipe again.

Made this recipe as is many times, always a big hit. To Vjohnson8, why would you expect this recipe to be a success when you made so many changes to it? I’m making multiple batches for freezer to distribute Christmas.

These are awesome!  I made 24 mini muffins to take to a friend's Christmas breakfast and they were delicious!  The only problem I had was preparing my tins the night before by placing red foil liners and spraying them.  The red on the liners came off in the tin and some on the muffins.

Cut brown sugar in half and still very sweet.  Cut down on butter as one person recommend with the cut sugar it was too buttery.  Not eatable, sorry but this recipe was a total failure for me.  I'm finding that youtube has better recipes!  Wouldn't make again.  I only made it because of the six reviews, but this was not a good one for me.

these were really yummy. I cut the sugar in half in accordance with a previous reviewer who said they were too sweet. I liked them, but they now seemed too buttery, so if making again I'd probably cut back the butter somewhat too.

Deliciously addictive..  No changes but I did double recipe.  Even with the double batch I wish I had made more.  Everyone who ate them loved them. Will definitely make again.  My new favorite.

Delicious and super easy to make.  It was a hit at the office and a frequent requested item for potlucks.  I add cinnamon and nutmeg to give it a seasonal twist.

I liked these but halved the sugar. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I chopped the pecan (I used just over a cup of chopped pecans) and added a dash of salt.  Next time I will also decrease the butter. These made just short of 24 mini muffins. I think I will try increasing the flour or adding oatmeal and maybe some baking powder.  Overall my kids and I all thought the taste was great.

These were a big hit at my office. They are very sweet. I chopped the 1 cup of pecans up for the mixture and used a whole pecan for the top. Made around 30 and cooked perfectly at 12-13 minutes. Definitely will make again!
