This did not turn out nearly as good as it sounded.  First of all, it was a bit weird to put pasta on top of potatoes. Secondly they were really dry because there was not enough sauce.  Also, there was not enough chicken to go aroundon all 4 potatoes.  It was definitely easy, but this is a case where it would be worth it to buy the separate ingredients and make it myself.
