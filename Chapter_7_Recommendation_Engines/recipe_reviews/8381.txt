WOW!  Great cake!  The only change I made was to puree the green tomatoes (skins, seeds, everything) drain for 30 minutes and use 2 cups of the puree rather than 4 cups of diced tomatoes.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of butter. The cake was delicious, especially with a dollop of vanilla fat free yogurt on top.

This is a fantastic recipe. I love it. I did do two things wrong and it still was amazing. I put only two cups of green tomatoes, and secondly I was forgot to skin the green tomatoes and just diced them up really small. The green tomatoes actually are not like red tomatoes and the skins did not come off and were not chewy. In fact I really couldn't tell you where the pulp began and the skin started.    

Thank you so much!

This a really good, moist cake--but I made a couple of alterations based on what other reviewers suggested. In my opinion, the best way to handle the tomatoes is to dice them and remove the seeds, then put them in a food processor--pulse until they are in small pieces but not liquified. Then I followed the recipe (put them in a colander, salt, rinse; let them drain). I also suggest cutting the nutmeg back to half a teaspoon. I also added an extra egg since I am at a high altitude (over 5,000 ft.) I like the cake with a cream cheese icing, but my husband likes it plain. One kind of funny thing about this cake is that it tastes better than it smells or looks!

This recipe was surprisingly very good, and it used up many of my green tomatoes easily.  I made a few changes to the recipe, using splenda instead of sugar and nut flour instead of regular flour.  I also used a cream cheese frosting which tasted wonderful as another reviewer suggested.  The only thing I would advise is to be sure to cut the tomatoes into small pieces.  I cut mine into average sized pieces and they could easily be seen and looked strange in the dish.  Next time I will be sure to cut them small!

Easy and lots of fun at any big gathering!  I took this cake to our local garden club meeting(they all have LOTS of green tomatoes at summers end!) It's an easy to throw together cake(I didn't salt or drain the chopped tomatoes...too lazy, and my Roma's aren't very juicy to start with).  I topped it off with a cream cheese frosting,  so whats not to like?.  I'm sure you can play around with lots of spices to your own taste.  I think I'll be making this cake quite often during the next couple of weeks while the garden winds down.  Might even try a chocolate version?  Give it try,  if for no other reason than to use up some of those many green tomatoes!

Unbelievabley moist. Didn't need to peel tomatoes so save yourself some work.  I didn't have raisins but had sultana's and added some chopped apricots. Cream cheese frosting finished it off perfectly.  Took into work and everyone loved it.  Will make again next year when I have more green tomatoes. Thanks Glenda

I love this recipe & can't believe I never rated it before.  I usually don't tell people about the tomatoes until after they've tried it & raved!  This is one of my most-requested desserts!  I too cut the sugar to about 1.5 cups, and don't usually put in the raisins (only because I have too many friends who don't like them).  Also - I have tried it with the cream cheese frosting & without.. I prefer without, it's just too good all on it's own!  YUMMY - one is baking now & the house smells so good!  I can't wait for later! **as a side note - I have since tried this in a bundt, and had good success.  I baked longer & at 330, and had no problem with a soft center as previous reviews stated.  Also drizzled the rum cream-cheese glaze from another recipe - YUM!**

No one at work guessed the green specks were tomatoes. I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting which I added cinnamon to. It was a hit!

It is a really good cake, can't even tell there is green tomato in it.  Nice and moist.  It was a little time consuming, but worth it!

Wonderful! Everyone loved it and some were VERY surprised at how delicious it was. Threw the green tomatoes in food processor but stopped at small bit stage (don't puree). Excellent. Good to freeze drained tomatoes in 4C freezer bags for a future cake! This cake tastes surprisingly like a carrot cake for those of you not too sure about this recipe.

Well, my cakes are just out of the oven and I'm amazed. (I doubled the recipe and made two stoneware jellyroll pans)  Look great, taste great w/no frosting!  I put the tomatoes in the food processor and then drained them in a mesh sieve w/o salt.  This is an important step as quite a bit of liquid comes out...1/2 to 1 cup for mine.  The only other changes I made were to omit raisins and lower the oven temp to 325 degrees based on the efficient heat conduction of the stoneware.  Those stinkers are perfect!

This cake is incredible!!  I did what f64club did, pureeing the tomatoes seeds, skins and all.  I let sit in a colander to drain the excess liquid (and used the liquid for watering a plant).  I used a little over two cups of puree.  I also made enough puree (refrigerated) to make one more cake, PLUS froze two more portions for future use.  I am predicting my brother will love this.  I didn't have the raisins but did add walnuts.  Reminds me of a zuchinni cake.  Incredibly moist!  My Mom wants to try a cream cheese frosting, but honestly, this cake can easily stand alone!!

Surprisingly very delicious! Similar to carrot cake, but even better. This is actually one of the best cakes I've had, especially with a cream cheese frosting (I blended 2 of the most popular recipes on this site):


(For a 9x13 cake)
8 oz cream cheese
1/4 - 1/2 cup butter, softened (I used 3/8 cup)
2-4 cups confectioners' sugar (I did closer to 2.5 cups, so it wasn't too sweet... I like more cream cheese than sugar, but you can make it more sweet)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

I used my blender and substituted 1/2 oil for the butter.  Placed the oil in blender and added sliced tomatoes, a few at a time, until there was 2 1/2 cups in blender.  Then added eggs to mixture a nd blended a few more seconds.  Added this to dry ingredients. Finished according to directions.

This was awesome! Tastes like Spanish bar cake.Very moist- do drain tomatoes. I squeezed the water out after pulsing in food pro per other reviews. I used 2 cups tomatoes, decreased sugar by 1/2 c, subbed half the butter with applesauce, used 1 c raisins and no nuts. Very very good. Best was seeing my son't face when I told him what it was lol!

if you are wondering what green tomatoes in a cake taste like, I found them to taste like cooked yellow raisins.  I was very apprehensive to try this recipe but it actually turned out good.  I topped mine with a cream cheese frosting and I really think that is what made this cake.  Will prob not be my "go to" coffee cake but I can def see myself making this again next time I have a bunch of green tomatoes I need to use up.

This was fantastic.  Took the advice of others and pureed the tomatoes.  Noone in our house likes raisins so I substituted coconut and had pecans not walnuts.  I didn't measure my spices so I'm sure I added more than listed, but we like our 'spice cake' to be super spiced so that's a matter of personal taste.  Good recipe.  Plan to try adding cocoa powder next time I have an abundance of green toms.

I'm hooked!!  I didn't use any sugar - instead I used 2 bananas and 2 Tbsp of honey.  I'm not sure I'd use the honey again, don't think it needs it.  Wow!!  What a total surprise on how great this cake is!!

This is very good. I used canned pumpkin in place of the butter, and I didn't drain out the juices of my tomatoes. It smells odd baking, and looks just horrifying, but it tastes great and is very rich, dense, and moist. Yum!

The cake is delicious and a great way to use up green tomatoes.  I used the version from another reviewer (2 cups of drained, pureed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes).  Because of the amount of moisture in the cake and from the puree you should definitely use a shallow, rectangular cake pan.  I used a circular springform pan - the cake didn't cook evenly and I had to cut out the middle.

Just made 3 of these (I had a lot of green tomatoes!).  This is delicious!  I did throw the tomatoes in the food processer, after dicing, seeds, skins and all.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly.  However, I found that the cakes that I put in nonstick pans cooked much faster and one was a little dry.  The next one in such a pan I took out sooner than the recommended 40 minutes and it was fine.  So if you are using a nonstick pan check after about 30 minutes.  It doesn't need a frosting at all but I put a cream cheese frosting on anyway.  Either way it's very good!  Thank you for a fabulous way to use up my green tomatoes!

Excellent! I replaced the butter with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, used 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and used pecans. Family loved it, didn't even need frosting it was plenty sweet.

I would suggest pulping the tomatoes instead of chopping them and then let the pulp drain for 30 mins.  I used 2 cups of puree instead of 4 cups of chopped tomatoes.  The cake came out moist and my family never noticed the tomatoes in the cake until I told them!  They all loved it!  Definitely doing this one again!

I bought a bunch of green tomatoes at our local produce stand and couldn't wait to try something new with them (I'd only ever had them fried before). Tried this green tomato cake and oh my WOW was it good!!! The only changes I made- added a bit of vanilla, omitted the raisins and subbed pecans for the walnuts. I also baked it in a tube pan and didn't even frost it as I had planned to because it was so perfectly moist and delicious as is! My 5 year old twin daughters aren't green tomato fans, so I told them it was green apple cake and they happily gobbled it up! My husband and I couldn't believe how much it tasted like apples either. We have found a new transition-into-fall recipe that's sure to be a staple around here- thanks so much!!

Love this cake! I too used applesauce instead of the butter. So moist and excellently spiced. We ate it without any frosting.

Tastes kind of like zucchini bread--delicious!  Very moist, very sweet.  I'll definitely make this again.  Didn't add any raisins or walnuts.

This is a fantastic cake!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated but added a dash of cloves and cardamom.  So moist and great slathered with cream cheese icing. Next time I will replace some of the tomato with carrot and pineapple as it is very much my ideal carrot cake spice blend. P.S.  As other posters stated I processed the tomatoes unpeeled in the food processor then salted and drained.  They did show up as green specks in the baked cake.
Update:  Did add 1/2 cup of carrot and 1/2 cup of pineapple to replace one cup of tomato.  Perfection!  I used frozen tomatoes that I had salted rinsed and drained before freezing.

This cake was okay.  It was alot like a spice cake, although the texture was a little unpleasant.  I didn't like it enough to make it again.

Really good! Wasn't expecting much but I had a bunch of green tomatoes from my garden and just figured I'd make a bunch of little cakes and take them into work and give them out. Unfortunately, they are so good I am going to have to make more if I want to take them to work because my family has eaten almost all of the ones I made!

I left a few bigger chunks in the tomatos and when I bit into them they almost tasted like apples. Sweet bread. Delicious with a caramel frosting! So Keeping this one... WAY to many green tomatos this year....

I was looking for a way to use up my green tomatoes besides fried green tomatoes. After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try. Although I chopped my tomatoes pretty small, I still felt I wanted them to blend into the cake more so after salting and rinsing, I put them in the food processor for just a few seconds until they became a fine mash, then let them drain again. I'm glad I did that because I liked the way they distributed in the batter. I also reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cups since I don't like cakes to be too sweet. Other than that, I made the recipe as written. After it came out of the oven I dusted it with powdered sugar. This was so delicious and quite moist. And no one will guess the secret ingredient since it blended right in. A definite make again next time I have green tomatoes.

I was expecting something a bit more exotic, but it tasted like a great spice cake! I made a basic cocoa icing and put a very thin layer in between to 8" rounds. It was pretty great!

This recipe is surprising, fun and delicious.  I made it for my family first after reading all of the reviews here and they loved it.  I then made it for a July 4th party and it was a HUGE hit.  This recipe is one of my all-time favorites.  When you make this for the first time, don't panic because the batter seems really thick (almost like cookie dough).  It will get better when the diced tomatoes are added, although it is still thicker than most other cake recipes I have made in the past.

this is delicious.  Instead of the salt and rinsing, I zapped the tomatoes in a food processor and then drained the liquid off in a strainer.  Then I measured 4 cups of pulp.  I used just 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  This is a winner!

This was great. I made a few adjustments based on others comments: did 2 cups of green tomato puree and left it to drain (without salt), substituted applesauce for *most* (though not all) of the butter, used whole wheat flour, used brown sugar (only because I didn't have any white) and doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg because I like things spicy. Delicious, delicious, delicious. A very healthy breakfast cake as is, and would be a great dessert cake with cream cheese frosting.

I decided to put the batter in muffin tins. Bad idea. They tasted great but were very ugly. I am sure that the cake form is probably more presentable. Very fun way to use green tomatoes!

Love this recipe!! So easy and tasty. Great way to use up green tomatoes other than frying them :)

I followed the recipe exactly as shown except I used 2 cups of tomatoes very finely chopped (almost blended), as suggested by another reviewer... Also, I was fooled when the toothpick came clean quiet early on (around 30 mins). Turns out it could have used a few more minutes, not the full 45 though. 

Thanks Glenda!

I HAD SOME GREEN TOMATOES THAT I WANTED TO USE AND FOUND THIS RECIPE. IT IS REALLY FANTASTIC. IT DOESN'T NEED FROSTING. I ONLY PUT IN 1 1/2 CUPS OF SUGAR THE FIRST TIME I MADE IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SWEET SO THIS MORNING I MADE ANOTHER ONE AND ONLY USED I CUP OF SUGAR. WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. I AM GLAD I FOUND THIS RECIPE. I LIKE TO MAKE DIFFERENT THINGS TO USE UP MY GARDEN BOUNTY. I ALSO MADE THE GREEN TOMATO LASAGNA AND LOVED IT. I MADE 8 QTS OF GREEN TOMATO MINCEMEAT. LOVE THIS SITE.

This was a surprising treat for the end of the harvest.  I gave it 5 stars because it had great taste and for its unique ingredients.  The whole house smelled awesome while this was baking, although I did have to bake it significantly longer than the directions indicated.

This was a great recipe! Keeper for when my kids get into the garden and pick me some unripe tomatoes. The only thing i changed was craisens instead of walnuts. Friends and family loved it. The only thing I would change is the cutting back on the butter just for the sake of cutting calories.

Yum! This cake is so moist and delicious right out of the oven and is just as good the next day! I left out the walnuts and substituted butter for 1/2 cup applesauce and just a tiny touch of butter. I also used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. If I have more green tomatoes I will definitely make this again!

Ignore your first reaction to the name of the cake and give it a try! It is a delicious and easy spice cake. The tomatoes dissappear when cooked but they leave the cake beautifully moist. Just don't tell anyone the main ingredient until after they have tried it. I used a caramel icing from this site and it was amazing!

I made this cake exactly as written. Everyone thought it was delicious and very very moist.  This a great way to use up even the smallest green tomato left on vine.  Hope to see more recipes using green tomatoes.  If you don't have green tomatoes, later I think I'll tey carrots or apples.  It reminded me of carrot cake.

This was wonderful!  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used my blender to chop the tomatoes (almost puree), used 2 cups instead of 4 cups, salted, drained and then rinsed and drained again (about 15 min.) I used all applesauce (no butter) and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I used just a dash of nutmeg, and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I added pecans & raisins (because I love them!) It took only 30 min. @350.  It does not need any frosting.....moist & very tasty.  My husband loved it!  Thanks Glenda for a fabulous, easy to make recipe.

I had a few tomato plants that got hit by an early frost.  So I had  all these green tomatoes on the plants.  My dd said that we should make something with them. So of course we checked allrecipes for a suitable recipe.  I was skeptical at making a green tomato cake but based on the reviews we tried this recipe.  I diced the tomatoes and got 4 cups.  I then pureed the tomatoes and that measured 2 cups.  I didn't have nutmeg so I substituted 1/4 tsp. cloves.  I omitted raisins as I don't like them in baked goods.  I added pecans as that is what I had on hand.  After I added the pureed tomatoes I thought it had a peculiar green tinge so I added another 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon.  I frosted the cake with a caramel frosting.  I will make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe

Really good!  I made a couple of changes - I did not add salt to the dry ingredients as the tomatoes are already salted (didn't miss the additional salt), used 1/2 c applesauce instead of butter, and (like a quick bread recipe), instead of creaming the butter/applesauce with the sugar, I  mixed the dry ingredients together and all the wet ingredients together, then stirred the dry into the wet.  Even my skeptical husband ("What?!  Green tomatoes?") loved it.  Will make again NEXT year with any green tomatoes we have.

This cake was wonderful and moist. When I told my husband it had green tomatoes in it, he wasn't going to even try it. 
After he tried it, I saw him sneaking and getting another piece. I'm making it again this weekend for my out of town guests.

Super moist & delicious! Some people guessed that I had put apple in it too (it does resemble an apple cake) but I didn't. I followed the recipe to the letter & was not disappointed. Next time I might put a little less sugar.

This is seriously yummy with cream cheese frosting.  I had a bush full of green tomatoes and it got flooded out this weekend and started to die.  I didn't want to waste all those green tomatoes.  But next year I would pick them green on purpose to  make this!

I really tried this as an experiment since I have so many green tomatoes and was very pleasantly surprised.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, left out the nuts, used golden raisins, and added some diced candied ginger.  The cake was really great, no icing needed.  Next time I will definitely cut the tomatoes much more finely, but even so it's a great-tasting, easy, and healthy cake that I'll definitely make again.

I really was hoping to like this recipe and I did!!!It was great. I brought it to a family function and no one could believe it was made from tomatoes. I pureed the tomatoes and accidentally forgot to rinse off the salt before adding it to the batter. Yikes! I added cream cheese frosting to cover up the salty taste and it worked. No one noticed. I will keep portioned frozen green tomato puree in my freezer just for this recipe. Tastes just like a carrot cake. This is also a great recipe to try for extra green tomatoes http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/mexina-salsa-verde/Detail.aspx

This is a very good, moist cake.  I pureed the tomatoes without the seeds and drained them well without salt, using two cups pureed tomatoes.  I added a tsp. of molasses when adding the eggs to give the sugar the flavor of brown sugar.  I also changed the spices to 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. allspice and ¼ tsp. cloves.  Adding the molasses and extra spices covered up any possible taste of the tomatoes coming through.  They also helped to give it a nice brown color throughout with no hint of green anywhere.  Since I didn’t use salt when draining the tomato puree, I think I will increase the salt to ½ tsp. next time to counteract some of the sweetness. It doesn’t need any icing.

Truly wonderful.  I only got to taste a bit before it was gobbled up by others, but the tomatoes maintain a very nice tartness which is perfect against the cake.  I intended to use cream cheese frosting, but was told that it was too good on its own--so we went without completely.

Halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan and it was very good but too sweet and not spicey enough for my taste. Made it again today (8x8 pan again) with the following changes and it's delicious: Half of original recipe for the tomatoes, flour, baking soda, salt and eggs.  1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. nutmeg, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup nuts and substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter and omitted the raisins.  Baked for 42 minutes. Also did not salt or rinse chopped tomatoes, simply chopped in mini chopper till finely chopped, measured 2 cups (approxiately 4 medium tomatoes) and drained (pressing down occasionally) in colander while preparing rest of ingredients. Hope to find more green tomatoes at the farmers market tomorrow.

Holy cow! Who knew green tomatoes would make such a great cake. I took the advise of others and just pureed the tomatoes skins and all. Then I drained the 4 cups of puree, no salt, to leave just 2 cups of pulp. I also added cream cheese frosting and it was one of the best cakes I have ever made. Everyone is upset that it will pretty much be a once-a-year thing when the tomato plants are pulled!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for making it possible to use up an abundance of green tomatoes.The cake is first rate.Followed the instructions to the letter. The only deviation I made was to put the batter into two 9x5 loaf pans. One to eat, the other to freeze.

I have joined Allrecipes just so I can rate this cake - it is the BEST use of green tomatoes that I know!  I pureed the tomatoes and did not use the salt/drain (we are a low-salt family.  I also used 1/2 c. egg substitute, and 1 cup sugar/1 cup Splenda. It tastes so good that it disappears in no time. Don't even need frosting. I would give it 6 stars if I could!

I omitted the nuts and raisins and pureed my tomatoes before adding them to the batter and it was great! I also used 1 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves instead of the 1 tsp nutmeg(since I am not a big nutmeg fan). Will be making this again, such a soft, moist cake!

I found myself with an abundance of green tomatoes, living in the midwest, after the first freeze.  I found this recipe and was tickled.  I did follow the recipe pretty much except I processed four cups of green tomatoes in a food processor and skipped the soaking them in salt water part.  I strained the juice off with a collander for about 15 minutes.  I used pecans and topped the cake with cream cheese frosting!  I COULD NOT believe how great this cake is!  Too bad we don't have green tomatoes year round!  I highly recommend trying it.  It's wonderful and thanks so much for sharing this with us.  It's a keeper!

I was pretty skeptical to start, but with so many leftover tomatoes, figured I'd give this recipe a try. Good thing, because I'm very pleasantly surprised by how it turned out.  The only change I made was to substitute one cup of the white flour for 7/8 cup of whole wheat flour--it came out very moist and flavorful, with a nice crunchy crust on top.  The only other change i would make is to reduce the sugar by about a half cup as it did turn out VERY sweet.  Thanks for the recipe, I look forward to using up more tomatoes this way!

This was very good and moist.  My family loved it.  

I just chopped up about 4 big green tomatoes, quartered them and put them in the food processor.  I processed them until they were small chunks, about the size of peas.  

I didn't drain them or anything, just poured the mix right into the batter.

This was a deliciously sneaky cake. My younger brother, who doesn't like tomatoes, and younger sister, who can't stand green tomatoes, both loved this cake. I followed the recipe exactly, and topped it with a cream cheese/cool whip/cinnamon frosting and it was fabulous.

Salting the green tomatoes ruined the entire cake.  I rinsed and rinsed them and the salt simply did not meld into the flavor of the cake at all.  I choked down a piece, let my husband try it...which he hated because of the salt.  My suggestion is make a simple syrup of equal parts water and sugar cooked on the stove and precook the tomatoes in the syrup before adding to the cake.

Excellent!  I'm a north carolina native, and I wonder why I have never seen this in restaurants.  I made it a round layer cake, and put a cream cheese icing on it.  Maybe a touch of lemon juice would add some extra zing.

I cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups and added 1/2 cup applesauce. It was great! It would also make for a good muffin or bread recipe in addition to cake.

Since we have a short growing period in Nebraska, the green tomato cake is a perfect solution for all the extra green tomatoes.
With the cream cheese frosting, it is very similar to a carrot cake, and I get many compliments and am asked for the recipe whenever I serve this moist cake.

I think this is an awesome way to use green tomatoes!  I made mine with gluten free flour, cocnut oil and coconut sugar.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was still really good.  The only thing I would do differently would be to dice the tomatoes really small.  The chunks in mine may put some people off.  Delicious flavor.

I needed to use up a bunch of green tomatoes so I decided to try this despite not really thinking that it could taste good.  I'm so glad that I tried because it's fantastic. I'm going to make another batch tomorrow to use of the rest of the green harvest I have.

This is absolutely THE best cake I have made all year. The only changes I made were to make it with one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown, and I used apple sauce instead of butter. Dice the tomatoes really small, and nobody would ever guess they were in it. Absolutely fantastic. Thanks so much, Glenda!

This may be the yummiest yum that's ever yummed. I bake this cake in bread pans and pass it out like candy at work. I may change my religion based on this recipe, not sure how that's going to work yet but I'll let you know once I figure it out.

All I can say is YUM!  That's all I've ever heard from anyone who has eaten it.  I pureed my tomatoes and used two cups as a reviewer suggested and used cinn. applesauce for half the butter.  Worked great!

This cake was delish. Just changed it up a bit to make it healthier. I used applesauce instead of butter,1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 the sugar called for. Used the food processor the chop the tomatoes and drained well. I frosted with some leftover cream cheese frosting that I had frozen for a carrott cake. Defrosted that and voila! You will be sorry if you don't try this recipe. Great use of those green tomatoes before the frost. Moist with the right amount of spices. Loved it.

Only 3 Weight Watchers points plus based on these modifications:  replaced all of the butter with unsweetened applesauce, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, and replaced walnuts with chocolate chips (only because I love chocolate).  Baked in a parchment-lined pan for 38 minutes and it came out very moist and yummy!

This is a great moist cake.  I usually put the batter into 2 8x8 pans, because I can freeze one cake for later.  It is so rich it goes a long way.  I've frosted with the crem cheese frosting, and I've also just packed coconut on top.

This is my first Green Tomato Cake. I was using up some tomatoes from my garden. I followed the recipe with one exception of cutting nutmeg down to a dash instead of a tsp because I find nutmeg to be overpowering at times. I used a food processor to 'chop' the tomatoes.

The baked cake looks really bad and unappetizing.  But the flavor is great!  The texture is of between banana bread and apple pie. I topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting.
This is a great way to use up leftover green tomatoes.

I HATE tomatoes and was unsure about trying this recipe.  However, it was one of the best cakes I've had in a long time.  It tasted like a carrot cake and everyone that tried it loved it.  I made it with cream cheese frosting but plan to try caramel next time.  Don't be afraid to try this.

This cake is delicious! I didn't have raisins so I used dried cranberries, and a sweet cream cheese icing. I am only disappointed that I won't be able to make this cake year round! My tomatoes next spring may never have a chance to turn red!

OMG I baked this cake and while I was making it I was praying that it would be good because I do not even like tomatoes.  After I baked it I dusted it with confectioners sugar and put in fridge. To tell the truth I was kind of scared it try it because I thought it was going to be nasty because I do not like tomatoes.  But when my husband came home I gave him a piece and waited for his reaction.  He loved it!  I decided to taste it as well and it was AWESOME.  I cooked it in a bundt pan as well with no problems.  LOL  I can't believe a TOMATO cake can be soooo good...

Fabulous!  Loved this recipe, what a great idea to use up all those tomatoes that are still green at the end of summer.  I am lactose intolerant so I used my lactose free margarine and icing sugar with fruit juice for the frosting, thanks.  This one is a keeper!

Simple and delicious. I used a food processor to chop the tomatoes and ended up with 3 cups instead of 4. Didn't really hurt the end result. I also substituted 1/4 cup of AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour. The cake was a little too sweet for my taste so next time I'll reduce the sugar amount unless I have more green tomatoes.

I made this for Christmas with cream cheese icing.  I loved it and it was a great way to use up some of my green tomatoes.  I was getting tired of baking/frying them.  It wasn't much of a hit with everyone else, though.  My kids didn't eat it and about half of the adults liked it.  I probably won't make it again because I can't eat it all by myself!  I may try it with a different icing or incorporate the tomatoes into a bread instead...

I just drained the chopped green tomatoes in a collinder before adding to the batter.  I skipped the salting step.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Results were great.  Iced with cream cheese icing, tastes just like a carrot cake. Even the kids ate it!

This is a great spice cake type recipe that uses the leftover green tomatoes!  I pureed the tomatoes (skin seeds and all) and used two cups of puree.  I let it sit in the strainer while I prepared the rest of the ingredients but I didn't salt or rinse them.  It came out great!!  I used end of the season tiny tom tomatoes (basically cherry tomatoes).  Thanks!

I was really skeptical of this recipe, but it is really good!  I had a ton of green tomatoes (big and small) that I didn't want to waste.  I didn't have raisins, so I omitted those.  I used the Philadelphia cream cheese icing recipe on top, and it tasted just like a spice cake.  I'll be making this every year at the end of summer gardening season!

Oh my!  This was excellent!  You would never know there were green tomatoes in this cake.  I had so many in my garden at the end of the season and was delighted to find this recipe.  So moist and good.  Forget the icing.  I think it would take away from the wonderful taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just don't try to make them as muffins!  They don't have enough structure to come out of the muffin tin in one piece!  Still yummy though!  Used food processor for chopping the tomatoes;  Modified to 1 C wholewheat flour and 1 C all purpose.  Also substituted 1 C sugar for brown.   Next time will use apple sauce  in lieu of 1/4 C of butter.

So yummy.  I make muffins/cupcakes with this recipe.  I've made several batches in the past two weeks and have pureed some tomatoes to stock my freezer.  Everyone I've given them to is amazed that there's tomato in them.  I don't use the raisins or nuts - don't need them.  This recipe is great with or without frosting.

This was great as written (did not add walnuts).  My husband kept saying "wow" as he ate it.  I left the tomato pieces semi-large (~1/2 inch).

Great start on a cake! I pureed my tomatoes in the blender because I don't have a food processor. My only complaing is that I halved the salt on the tomatoes, and it was still quite salty. I washed the pieces well, and not all the salt came off. I would use 1/4 of the salt at most next time (and also leave it out of the batter). Other than that, it was great! Frosted it with a cream cheese frosting, and it tasted like a moist spice cake. Some of my husband's friends were over unexpectedly last night, and they devoured it!

I found the recipe way too sweet.  I cut the sugar from 2 Cups to 1.5 cups and it was still too sweet.  I will try it again next year with only half the sugar because it is a great way to use up a lot of green tomatoes and I do like the spices in it.

It is ridiculous how good this is.  It's making me ask random people if they grow tomatoes so I can give them the recipe.  I blended the tomatoes in the food processor before salting & draining, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next year I'll be picking green tomatoes during the summer just to make this cake.

WOW. This was absolutely delicious! I could have sat down and eaten that whole cake. I topped it with cream cheese frosting and it really was amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect, and was skeptical. It comes out looking and smelling like a zuccini bread, but it is so moist and tastes like a cake. I put it in two round pans, hoping to make a layer cake, but it didn't come out of the pan easily, so I had two round cakes instead of one pretty layer cake. Still delicious!

This cake was a great way to use up the last green tomatoes of the season. I took it into work and no one could guess the "secret" ingredient. Loved it. I am not a cake eater, but enjoyed this one. Very much like a carrot cake.

This cake is SOO good.  I loved serving this to all my baking friends, and watching them try to guess my secret ingredient. I did do some changes,  I didn't salt or drain the tomatoes after shredding in my food processor. I added a tsp of ginger to the mix and used pecans instead of walnuts and NO raisins. Since the batter was a lot wetter I had to increase the baking time I did the orig. 45 min. then kept checking until it was done maybe another  30 min.  This cake is now part of my arsenal against my foodie friends.

This is one of the best spice cakes I've ever had. The tomatoes almost taste like apples! Very good. It doesn't need frosting but I used an orange glaze over the top the second time I made it. You have to try this! BTW: I did not use the walnuts. . . I didn't have them!

I made a vegan version of this cake for my sister's birthday (she's a vegan).  I substituted vegan butter for the dairy butter and used egg replacer for the eggs.  I added a cup of maple syrup because I only had three cups of sugar.  I topped the cake with shredded coconut instead of frosting.  It turned very good.  I left the tomatoes in fairly large chunks and liked it that way; their sourness reminded me of rhubarb.

I was SHOCKED at how moist this cake was!! I did not have nuts or raisins so I left the larger tomato chunks in and it blew away any zucchini cake I have ever made. I can't wait for next year's crop of tomatoes!  AWESOME recipe! One of the best I have ever made!!

This cake was excellent.  I followed the recipe to the letter, well I did peel the tomatoes, the recipe didn't call for that.  I read the reviews and thought, everyone of those people can't be wrong.  I have hundreds of tomatoes and had to do something so was looking for recipes for tomatoes green or red and this is what came up.  I couldn't wait to see what a cake tastes like with tomatoes in it.  My family and I love carrot cake, carrots are vegetables.  It was great, make it with cream cheese icing and without.  Everyone loves it.  I will be taking this to our family reunion next Saturday and see their reactions.  I have already had to give the recipe out to others.  The picture posted looks just like what you get.  Yum......

What a wonderful way to use the left over
green tomatoes.  I did make one change. I
do not like nutmeg so I used 1 tsp. allspice and 1/4 tsp. cloves along with the cinnamon. Also, I am on a salt restricted diet so I did not put salt with the tomatoes when I drained them.
I just drained them a little longer.

I actually made the Paula Deen verison of this cake. And let me tell you it is fabulous. The only difference is the a little or more/ less of some of the ingredients. Do not let the name fool you. It is to die for.

I used 2 cup tomato puree and skipped the 1 tbs salt since I wasn't draining them. 

It turned out fine -- a moist spice cake. The green color is surprising.  I wasn't planning on frosting, so I sprinkled a few extra raisins and walnuts on top before sliding it into the oven. The raisins sank a bit but the walnuts stayed. 

2 cups of sugar is a lot, but it helps counteract the green tomato. Even so, I could still taste a bit of "green" so a 4 rather than a 5.

This cake does taste good, and it's moist like carrot cake. I made it as written, except for the raisins. Next time I would follow another reviewer's advice and shred the tomatoes: I diced the tomatoes into small 1/4" pieces, but that just meant I had little gelatinous whitish-green bits in my cake. One kid made a "booger" comment, lol. The cake isn't as dark as, say, a chocolate zucchini cake, so those bits were obvious. I didn't find the tomato bits to be salty at all. Just be sure to rinse them well. I would make this again, with the addition of some other spices, such as ginger and cloves.

This is a good recipe.  I made it exactly as directed except I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar because that is what I had.  I would recommend that the tomato's be grated instead of chopped.  I found some really big chewy pieces in my cake and it would be better if they were not there.  If you like carrot cake or zuchini cake, you will like this cake.  An excellent way to use up those green tomato's. Thanks for this one.

This spicey cake turned out moist and tasty. I follewed a couple of suggestions and used 1/2 applesauce instead of butter, doubled the spices and pureed the tomatos. Thanks for sharing this great use for green tomatos.

Maybe I should have known, but either seed the tomatoes or puree well because the texture is weird with the seeds. Other than that...dee-lish!

This cake was easy and delicious. I brought it to work, and even those who were a little skeptical about the green tomatos loved it. I followed an earlier reviewer's advice and used cinnamon cream cheese frosting; it was the perfect compelement to the cake.

Terrific recipe...thanks for sharing!!!  I omitted the walnuts and doubled the raisins and it was absolutely yummy!!  No one believed me that it was made with green tomatoes!  Next time I am going to try it with apples instead of the walnuts.

It was exceptional for the first 36 hours, but then the tomatoes made the cake gummy and I had to throw it away.

I tried making it my heavy duty blender, as one commenter suggested. I thought it was a hassle trying to incorporate the ingredients below the blades, so next time I will go old school.  The cake was a good use of the buckets of green tomatoes hanging on the vines in October.  Tastes like zucchini bread.

This cake is GREAT! I ground the tomatoes in the food processor then squeezed and rinsed them in cheesecloth. I measured approximately 2 cups since they were then dry and dense. In the end the batter was too dry and I had to add water. I doubled the walnuts and omitted the raisins (not a big raisin fan) I glazed the warm cake with DaniBanani’s caramel glaze recipe from her Apple Harvest Pound Cake. It made an awesome combination.

I liked it but of course I adjusted the recipe. I pureed the tomatoes as suggested. I can't eat walnuts so I substituted pecans. My family doesn't like raisins, so I substituted white chocolate chips. I didn't frost the cake. It was a good coffe cake. Great way to use green tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoy this cake. You want to chop the tomatoes fine (I pulse them in a food processor).  I often cut the sugar in half and make muffins with this recipe.

This is a very moist cake.  I made it last year and shared it around and soon everyone was making it.  Really good.  This year I wanted to see if I could make it a little less moist so I used 3 cups chopped green tomatoes and removed most of the seeds.  I think that was a success and I'll do the same again.  I use golden raisins and follow the recipe exactly in all other regards.  When I made it last week we were camping and I shared it all around the camp site - rave reviews and astonishment that it was green tomatoes in there.

We've had early frosts this year here in Oregon and have ended up with a surplus of green tomatoes in our garden, so when I found this recipe I was eager to try it.  This is a basic spice cake tasting recipe that lends itself well to a variety of add-ins. Other fruits could be substituted here very easily. This recipe was easy to prepare and used ingredients in most people's pantries. I put my tomatoes in my food processor and pulsed them until coarsely chopped, similar to salsa. I also left them to drain with the salt for about 30 minutes, and patted them dry after the final rinse and drain.  The cake turned out moist and even though I decreased the sugar by 1/3 cup, still turned out sweet enough to eat without a glaze or frosting. For those that are wondering, there is no tomato taste whatsoever.  I'm looking forward to making muffins for freezing next time. Love this cake!

Found this recipe when looking for ways to use up green tomatoes that I had to pick before frost got them.  I was very surprised at how well it turned out.  Made 2 cakes in 1 week to share at school and work (some picky eaters) and they disappeared FAST!  It tastes like an apple spice cake.

I put the tomatoes in a mini food processor so they were very finely chopped. I reduced the sugar  to 1&1/2 cups and added these things: juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  Then I baked it in muffin tins and did not put any icing on it - didn't need it.  DELICIOUS!   Next time I might add a tsp of baking powder to fluff them up a bit.

I tried this about two years ago after coming into an abundance of green tomatoes. It was awesome! Topped it off with a cream cheese frosting with a hint of lemon. I have also made these into cupcakes. I never tell people what's in it until after they eat it. 5 stars.

I found I needed an extra half cup (for a total of 4.5 cups) of chopped tomatoes to end up with 2 cups of the puree.
Otherwise, I made it exactly as described and it was excellent.  I will *definitely* make this one again!

Yum!  What fun to use up the green tomatoes I thought would go to waste.  Instead, my waist.  

I pulsed them in my mini food processor, needing 2 times.   Soaked as directed, rinsed, and drained.  I used 2 heaping cups for the cake.  I can see bits of green so I suppose I could have pulsed them a bit more.  No matter, we are eating cake!  I sprinkled with powdered sugar only to make my husband think it was done and "frosted".

Finally made this after saving it last fall and not having any green tomatoes to use! I was afraid it would be too salty with so much added to the tomatoes, but when drained all the salt ended up in the juice and not on the tomatoes themselves. I used a bit less sugar and half whole wheat flour to make it healthier, and oil instead of butter because I didn't want to wait for it to soften. I used my immersion blender to make the tomato pieces a bit smaller too, once they were in the batter. I love to sneak veggies into things and my kids loved it, even when they found out!

As a previous reviewer suggested., I puréed the tomatoes, seeds and all.  Doubled the cinnamon. A wonderful recipe. Easy. Great with cream cheese icing. Hubby and friends loved it.  I gave 4 stars because I made those few changes, but really a 5 star cake!

used 2 c puree (4 c green tomatoes in blender, drain 10 min and discard liquid) instead of chopped tomatoes for more uniform texture.

reduced sugar to 1 1/2c. Could probably reduce more.

doubled cinnamon, added ginger.

added walnuts, raisins, pumpkin seeds.

I found that if I take the time to seed the tomatoes before finely chopping in the food processor, there is no need to salt/rinse/drain.   50 minutes at 335 is perfect.  Note to self: when grandkids proudly bring me an ice cream pail full of green tomatoes from my garden, just smile and use them all in this cake.

This cake was soooo good ! I didn't think it would taste that good with the unripe tomatoes,but I was amazed how well it turned out. My spouse can not stop raving about it to his friends,he is actually making all his friends try it and giving it away. He was that amazed how good it tasted. Thumbs up to whom ever made up this recipe.

I used half brown sugar and half white and I thought it was great!  I also just chopped tomatoes fine in processor and set to drain in wire mesh strainer for an hour and did not do the salt and rinse method and it was fine.

When I tell people about "Green Tomato Cake," they never believe me!  It is SO good!!!  Tastes like a carrot or zucchini cake... tastes nothing like tomatoes, and I found it more moist than the carrot or zucchini.  The spices in this recipe are also awesome!

We loved this cake! A couple changes we made was we puree the tomatoes,  let it drain, and used about 2 1/4 cups of the puree, this helped with the texture alot! I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves as well as some grated carrot.  I will make this recipe again but I will use a little less sugar cause it turned out very sweet.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used 2 cups pureed green tomatoes and it worked beautifully.   I have made this in the past chopping green tomatoes and it was a chore - but this way - it was time saving.    2 cups pureed tomatoes instead of 4 cups chopped tomatoes.

This was awesome! Just the kind of cake my mom always used to make. :-) My husband was skeptical when I told him I was making a cake with green tomatoes, but he loved it! I cut the recipe in half since I only had 2 cups of chopped green tomatoes (I pulsed them in my Ninja a few times), and used a 9x9" pan. The only other change I made was omitting the salt from the batter, as the drained tomatoes were still rather salty even after rinsing well for several minutes. I used golden raisins and topped it with my mom's cream cheese frosting. I will definitely save this one for green tomato season next year!

This cake is DELICIOUS!!! I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups from 2. Also replaced butter with coconut oil. The spices make it taste like a good moist apple spice cake. My family all gave it a thumbs up. Highly recommend this recipe.

I chopped the tomatoes in the food processor and ended up with about 3c semi-pureed.  I used half butter and half apple sauce and cooked about 42 mins.  I could have taken out sooner as it was definitely done.  Taste was fine, like a spice cake, but I wouldn't say overly sweet or overly amazing.

This is really good. I made a few changes due to other reviews and what I had on hand. I added 1 large over ripe banana with the 3 cups of the green tomatoes I prepared a week ago. I only used 1 cup of sugar and replaced the butter with coconut oil. I added 1/4 c oats in place of walnuts and extra heavy on the cinnamon and nutmeg. Baked for 35 min. My husband loves it and he hates tomatoes. No icing needed. This was very easy to make and turned out delicious! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This cake is very good...and a great way to use up those green tomatoes...for those wondering...the flavor is a cross between a carrot cake and an apple spice cake.

Amazing cake. Great texture and flavor--nothing tomato-y about it.
We used only 1/3 the amount of sugar, and the cake was still plenty sweet. Also added a few golden raisins (about 1/3 cup), which proved to be a nice addition.

Very good.  Never would have guessed.  I took some advise from others.  I chopped my tomatoes skin and seeds in the food processor, then allowed to drain in a sieve.  I cut sugar to 1-3/4 cups.  I used 1-1/2 cups regular flour and 1/2 cup coconut flour.  I didn't have raisins so I used about 1/4 cup currents and a little more than a 1/4 cup craisins.  Topped with powdered sugar.  Will make this again.

I made quit a few changes using this recipe. I took out the seeds and pureed the tomatoes which turned it into 2 cups(I drained them also after puree) I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter, 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. 1 cup each of white and wheat flour and used only 1 3/4 cups sugar ( I may even go to 1 1/2 cups next time because it was still very sweet). I left out the raisins and nuts because my guys do not like them although I am sure they would have been terrific. And I made them into cup cakes which only took 15-20 min to cook. They do not even need frosting, they are so yummy and terrific with a cup of tea, coffee, or even milk. I will definitely use and suggest this recipe to my friends, It is terrific.

Very moist and tasty. I measured and salted the tomatoes per the recipes. I then rinsed and blotted dry. I pulsed the tomatoes in the food processor until very fine. I also used fresh ground nutmeg and I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. No frosting and took the cake to work. Everyone liked it and they were all surprised that is was a green tomato cake.

Excellent. Super moist. Made as directed (but only enough tomatoes for half a recipe in a 8X8 pan). Super moist. Frosted with cream cheese frosting.

This is a great recipe, it is now my mom's favorite cake, to bad you can only have it during green tomato season. Well unless you think ahead and freeze some of those last of the season tomatoes.

I accidentally doubled the butter, and it still came out well, especially with the cream cheese frosting that I made.  Will definitely make this one again, as we always have green tomatoes from our garden at the end of summer.

Loved this cake. I did cut back on the sugar by 1/2 a cup so it wouldn't be too sweet. I also pureed the tomatoes so it took an extra 15 min. to cook because it was so moist. So glad I tried it since I have 15+ pounds of green tomatoes.

I made this recipe tonight and everyone loved it!  I doubled the cinnamon, and cut the nutmeg in half (based on another reviewer). Also, made sure that my tomatoes were minced. My husband isn't a cake fan in general, but said he loved this one.  Said it reminded him of carrot cake.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  I plan to make several and freeze them, while the tomatoes are still on the vine.

I'm up to my ears in green tomatoes, and this was a great way to use up a few.  I've made the recipe twice, with a couple of alterations each time.  The first time I used half whole wheat and half white flour and the second time I used half whole wheat and half oat flour.  It was good both ways.  On the second batch I ran out of walnuts so I used some hazelnuts in their place, and I think I actually like the hazelnuts better.  Both times I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and left out the raisins.  I still think it's sweet enough not to need frosting.

Excellent recipe!  I followed other advice....put the tomatoes in the food processor and squeezed the liquid out and then measured 2c. of the puree.  Other than that, I made no changes.  Excellent by itself...and really yummy with some cream cheese frosting.  NOBODY can guess what this is made from!

I modified this cake almost beyond recognition, so it may not be accurate for me to review it.  However, it was still a good use for green tomatoes, so this is what I did:

Pureed about eight cups of green tomatoes that I mashed in a fine-meshed strainer to yield four cups (no salt added).  I combined this with a cup of okara and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.

Separately I combined the flour (all whole wheat) with 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp stevia, the salt, spices, baking pwd, and walnuts. I added the wet to the dry and added about 1/4 cup soymilk. Baked at 350 for about 75 minutes.

I topped it with a simple powdered sugar glaze flavored with maple extract.  It was quite tasty, but very dense and moist.  If I end up with a bunch of green tomatoes again next year, I might resurrect this recipe and attempt a new modification to get it more cake-like.

I did not care for this recipe. I pureed the tomatoes first, but I think they make it taste incredibly eggy. The texture is really weird too.

This cake is amazing! I made this this morning and brought it to my friends at the pharmacy and they were freaking out!!! When I told them what the main ingrediant is they were totally shocked! Especially one of the staff! She was literally stunned being that she hates tomatoes no matter what color! Well, thanks for the recipe I will definitely make it again and again!!!

This is the nicest change from Tomato relish, fried, pies, etc.  The flavors are well balanced and it keeps well.

Taste is great! The little green squares of green tomato in the cake are a little strange though. Could substitute the tomato for another fruit that has lots of liquid in it and reduce the sugar.

I made this cake with our own green tomatoes still in the garden and it is fantastic.  I added 1 tsp. of ground cloves, increased the cinnamon to around 1 1/2 tsps. and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I will make this cake again and again.  Frosted it with a coffee cream cheese frosting.

This was pretty good.  Salted almost five cups of tomatoes, rinsed them well, and blotted off excess water. Then chopped 'em up in the food processor.  Used golden raisins.  I frosted it with whipped cream cheese sweetened with powdered sugar and milk.  I thought it was better the second day.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I enjoyed using up some of those green tomatoes!

What an excellent way to use up green tomatoes.  I also pureed and drained the tomatoes rather than chopping.  Really easy and cake is delicious.

Great recipe when those tomatoes don't turn red! I pureed the green tomatoes and used 2 cups. I substituted 1/2 c. canola oil for the butter and used 1 1/2 c. white sugar. Topped with cream cheese frosting. Delicious!

I make a lot of cakes for people and I take a lot of requests.  This may become everyone's favorite!  It is moist and so delicious!  I think next time I will cut back a little on the sugar, but overall it is one of the best cakes I have ever made.  I didn't even frost it!

Awesome!  I had lots of green tomatoes to use up and this was delicious.  I threw 5 cups of tomatoes in the blender with a little water and then strained them - ended up being about 2 cups.  I topped with Cream Cheese Frosting - what a delicious recipe.  Thank you.

This was delicious and reminds me of carrot cake or zucchini cake.  I pureed my green tomatoes...as is...didn't peel or seed them and I don't see the need to do either.  Followed directions otherwise (salting and letting them drain) and only used about 2 cups of puree.  Frosted it with cream cheese frosting and everyone wanted second and third helpings!  This will be a repeat for sure!!!

I had such an over abundance of green tomatoes at the end of last year, I was trying to find something I could make out of them.  This was an excellent choice!  It was a perfect coffee cake and honestly, when l I told people what was in it, they hardly believed me!!!

This was actually delicious. I pureed the tomatoes in the blender (becuase I knew my kids would be suspicious if I didn't). I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice, to give it a little more acid for the baking soda. I also used whole wheat flour. It was a wonderful moist cake. I will definitely make this next year.

excellent!! The only thing that I added was a carrot cake frosting that I found in another recipe on this site. I made  fried green tomatoes for dinner and served this this cake for dessert which really was something to remember.  The cake still featured the tomato flavor while being a wonderful dessert

Definately the best use of my green tomatoes that I had to rush in before the first frost! Absolutely must puree the tomatoes so they arent detectable. I kept the skins but removed the seeds. I used applesauce instead of the butter, and topped with a quick cinnamon cream cheese frosting. My husband thought it was carrot cake. Next time I'll try make two smaller loaves so I can freeze one for later. Thank you!

Yum yum. An easy, tasty way to use up those lingering green tomatoes. Pureeing the tomatoes may have made it more attractive, because the big green chunks are a little funny. Good recipe.

This turned out awesome. I did make a few changes. I only used 1/2 Tablespoon salt, I boiled the tomatoes first to remove the skin, and I added 1/4 tea of ginger, allspice, and clove to make it more like spice cake.

Really very good, moist, flavorful cake.  I cheated and instead of using the salt, I used my electric chopper until the tomatoes were almost a ground consistencty, then drained them by squeezing in a cheesecloth.  It may have actually removed a little too much liquid, I added some applesauce to compensate.  Also, husband hates raisins and walnuts, so ours had almond slivers and chocolate chips.  Turned out well, like by my whole, picky family.  Great with cream cheese frosting.

This was delicious.  No body could believe me when I told them the name of the cake.  Had to share recipe with everyone.  I will definitely make this again!!
