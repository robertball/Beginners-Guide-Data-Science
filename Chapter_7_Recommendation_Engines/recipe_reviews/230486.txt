This was yummy. Used this for some leftover chicken we had.  I used white balsamic instead and no feta, and melted provolone on the top. Really hearty sandwich. Great way to get extra veggies into my husband!

The only thing I changed was to omit the mushrooms (I don't care for them). But this was awesome sauce! Hubby even was surprised at how good it was!! Make it as is and you will be happy.
