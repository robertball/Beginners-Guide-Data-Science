This recipe is really tasty and tastes just like the Tiramisu at the Italian Restaurant I work at.  However, it needs to chill over-night to make it sit-up properly.  Also, the marscapone mixtures is too runny, so the second layer of lady fingers float to the top.  I would possibly suggest letting the marscapone mixture chill for awhile before putting ontop of the lady fingers.

This recipe is so delicious. I skipped the kirschwasser and added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  You will not be disapointed!

with tiramisu you can also subsititute the coffee, and liquer with ovaltine, or hot chocolate mix, tiramisu means pick me up, but in italy children are given the substitued one.

I had great hopes on this recipe but it did not turn out that great. I am disappointed.The only thing differnt i did was to replace kirschwasser. The chesse mixture came out more like a custard and the lady fingers got too soggy. It was a waste of a lot of ingredients not to mention time and effort.

This was great! I made it for a potluck, and it was so tasty. I didn't have any kirschwasser, so I substituted about a tbsp of vanilla. I went to the local Italian Market store for ladyfingers. The ones they had were more like filo dough than shortbread. I wish I had doubled the number of  ladyfingers. In a 9x13 pan, I put a layer of mixture, then the ladyfingers, then the rest of the mix. I left mine in the fridge overnight. It was great at lunch the next day.

I was really upset with the results of this recipe. I followed the directions and I let it sit over night and this was still very very runny. It didn't even have a good taste.

Very good!  Turned out beautiful and tasty.    Make sure you buy the thicker lady fingers.  I bought the ones on the top shelf thinking they would be better, but the package was not see-through.  I didn't see that the cookies were very thin, like vanilla wafers.  I think this recipe would have turned out even better for me if I had used the thicker lady-fingers, giving the "crust" a little more meat.    All in all, an AMAZING and delightful recipe.  Thank you.

This turned out EXCELLENT!   My only comment is that the number of ladyfingers is not enough for the 9 X 13 pan.  I used well over 30.   Increase the coffee to accommodate this. I used my espresso machine and made two double shots of decaf.   The dessert wasn't soupy at all; that reviewer must not have let it set.  It was truly the best tiramisu I've had, and I have eaten tiramisu in some excellent Italian restaurants.    Trust this recipe - it will not fail you!

This is a good recipe, but it turned out a little runny for me, almost a pudding-type texture even after chilling overnight.  Any ideas how I can fix this?

Very good!  This is the first tiramisu recipe I have ever made and I was very pleased.  You can taste the alcohol so I may add a little less next time.  If it turned out soupy you probably under beat the egg whites or soaked the cookies too long.  I left it sit for about 24 hours and it was perfect!

You have to let this sit for 24 hours or more so that the lady fingers absorb the liquid from the mascarpone filling.  I tried to serve it after 8 hours and it was runny.  The next day it setup perfect! Also, I did not leave the ladyfingers soak very long.

It never hardened. We kept in the refrigerator for hours, then overnight. It went from TiramiSOUP :) to TiramiPUDDING. It never developed the consistency of Tiramisu. BUT....it tasted DELICIOUS!

Everyone thought this tasted amazing. Heads up for anyone wanting to make this. Both the Mascarpone cheese and the Lady fingers were not available at my local grocery stores. I ordered the lady fingers from Walmart and I used a substitute for the mascarpone. 16 oz Cream cheese, 1/3 cp sour cream & 1/4 cp heavy cream mixed all together till smooth.

Change the name to tiramisu pudding and you have truth in advertising. Also it might help to cream mascarpone with the liquor. Wisk in the mascarpone mixture, then fold in the egg whites.

This tiramisu is really good, but you MUST only quickly dip the ladyfingers in the coffee. You should have quite a bit of coffee left after dipping the 24 fingers.   If you saturate the ladyfingers, you will get tiramisoup, as one other reviewer called it.  Its a 5 star, but its not foolproof. Thus the 4.

I made this at Christmas and it is AWESOME! Substituted Kahlua for the  kirschenschwasser?  Family  gathering coming up and this is the 3rd time it's been requested since Christmas! Not sure why some people are saying the mascarpone was runny. Mine has turned out perfect every time, and I'm not a fantastic cook.

Great recipe! I like my lady fingers a tad bit soggy so I added a bit more coffee. It came out great and just as good as the tiramisu at OG. I used Vicenzovo lady fingers so they stood up great to the custard and extra coffee I added. Thanks for this recipe!!

My all time favorite cake!! I might even go as far as to say my favorite desert! I LOVE this recipe soooo much. It's like having an iced coffee in a creamy, spongy cake form. DEFIANTLY making this again. And again. And probably again in the kind distant, but quite near future. :)

This is almost a 1:1 of the way my family makes it over in Italy. Thank you for sharing! I had a point to make that this recipe makes a better Tiramisu than all the others on here, whom make this relatively simple dessert far too complex and ruin it!

My husband LOVES tiramisu and always gets it when we go out to eat. I decided to make this for him as a surprise. He said this was the best tiramisu that he's ever had. My suggestions would be to buy extra ladyfingers if you are planning to make the amount listed on the recipe. I was able to make an 8x8 size dish with a pack of 24 fingers. I was also concerned that my egg whites were a bit soupy, so where it says to mix the ingredients with a wooden spoon, I used a hand mixer. With all the cheese and the whipping cream, things thickened up really fast. Also don't dust with the cocoa powder until you're ready to serve, unless you like the powder wet. The longer it sets in the fridge, the better it tastes.

Delicious!  I used the whisk beaters on my mixer to stir in the marscapone etc, then put it in the fridge while I made and cooled the coffee.  This addressed the runny problem in many reviews.  I also used a slightly smaller glass pan, which perfectly fit 12 ladyfingers in each layer and gave the final product a nice height.
