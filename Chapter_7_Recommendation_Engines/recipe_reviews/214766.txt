This is a wonderful, The first time I made it for about 100 people, mostly teenagers for an International dinner. Many come and told me how wonderful it was. It can be a little scary as you put it together and the batter looks way to thin, but it will turn out great.

I think this is a lovely warm pudding for the winter. I am South African and we often had this pudding for dessert. I would use a little less sugar as it tends to be on the sweet side. Enjoy it.

This is a wonderful warm dish to have! I made this last year for my girl scout troop and I ended up giving the recipe to three people! We all loved it!

Easy to follow,mine burnt a bit around the edges but the sauce covered the taste up a bit. It was a winner with my family giving some a dose of nostalgia, back to the old farm days.
