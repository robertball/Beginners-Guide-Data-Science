These were so tasty! I followed the recipe word for word except added less rum. I don't like very strong drinks. This turned out really good, however, after 24 hours they were so slushy you couldn't sip them! It was more like a daiquiri sorbet. Oh well, they were good and easy and I'll definitely make them again!

This is the best!!!  :)
I am getting famous for my daiquiris!!
Just to let everyone know, they are STRONG and very yummy!
I tend to find they are too frozen when I take them out of the freezer, so I mix and leave in the counter for a while before serving.

I took it easy on the rum because the mix looked wrong to me.  They're still really strong, but very good.  A great summer drink!

This is the perfect for a shower. I needed more servings so I increased the ingredients by 50% and used 1 qt. of rum. It was slightly strong for some guests, but they added a little non-alcoholic punch to their cups. I served this along side Mock Champagne.
