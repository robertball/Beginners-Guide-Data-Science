eu mustard mousse!!! But give it a try and you'll be flabbergasted. Embarrassed to admit it but I ate almost the whole thing myself. So delicious! Pastor's wife from Africa said this is her family tradition at Thanksgiving as well (as mentioned by Wilco).... soooo good!

I made this other day to accompany a special ham I purchased from Smithfield (so wonderfully dried aged it was almost a prosciutto). Well to cut a long story short we cut the ham thinly and put a dab of the mousse on the side everyone was in heaven. I made up the recipe the day before my dinner party exactly as the recipe instructed since it was the first time making it. I found one of my molds that was the perfect size (1 Quart) and quaintly designed never used it before so I had to scrub it up and thank heaven for Pam because my fingers would never have gotten down into all those nooks and cranny's after preparing the easy recipe poured it into the mold right up to about 1/4 inch from the top and sealed it and left in the fridge till the next day. I didn't un-mold till just before serving. I dipped the mold into a bowl of hot water just to the rim for about 20 seconds and inverted it to a pretty plate that baby slid right out....I felt like such a pro! Unfortunately I didn't even think about taking a photo until about four guests had sliced into it next time I will for sure because there will be a next time!!!! Someone else giving a review said that she thought this was a "Bavarian Mustard Cream" well one of my German guests said he had heard it called that in Austria...so that's my new name for it. This recipe will go on my Easter Menu because it pairs so well with ham is so visually pretty for company and most important can be made ahead.

I'm all for SIMPLE so I just poured it into a pretty crystal dish rather than a mold. It was delicious with our ham dinner and my guests asked for the recipe!

This was so good! I've been wanting to make it ever since I saw the recipe but haven't had an occasion to cook a big ham to serve it with. We had it at Easter and 6 adults and a couple of kids hardly made a dent in it. It's basically a mustard Bavarian cream. I put the leftovers in the freezer (mmm! Mustard "soufflé glacé"!) and maybe can figure out how to use it in a cold ham salad this summer. Next time I d reduce the sugar a bit because I wanted it to be more tangy.

This was really great. Read through other reviews before I decided to make it. I have never seen a recipe quite like this and thought I would take a chance. Didn't change a thing with the recipe. It was light fluffy and not overpowering. All the guests enjoyed it immensely. They asked for some to take to go with their leftovers. I say make it 'as is' the first time you make it for sure. Then you could tweak the recipe by adding some fresh herbs or maybe even a hint of fresh grated ginger. Fabulous recipe!

It was very good. Makes a lot. Mine did not look like this I think I used a bowl that was to big. Not sure how long will last in refrigerator. I always make things that have 5 stars.

Interesting side note: We've been making this recipe for years and I recently found it in an old celebrity cookbook submitted by Bette Davis.

I hate writing a bad review but I had such high hopes for this. The consistency was so fluffy and rich that I might have really enjoyed it if it weren't so sweet.
