LIGHT AS AIR! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the delicious passion fruit taste. I used 1 packet of gelatin (= a little less than 1 Tblsp.), which was the perfect amount. I  beat 8 teasp. meringue powder with 1/2 cup water (equaling 4 egg whites), instead of using the egg whites because the whites weren't being cooked (I'll simply use those whites in an omelette or cake).I reduced the sugar added to the egg whites to 1/2 cup, because this made for a lightly sweetened filling.  The recipe didn't specify what form of p'fruit juice, so I chose Goya brand 100% pure "Fruit Pulp" ( available in the freezer section of Latin & some regular grocery stores). Because this wonderfully strong flavored fruit pulp (which is really more of a puree) doesn't have added sugar & thus is very tangy, I added 2 Tblsp. sugar to make it more like a juice. (Use the frozen fruit juice concentrate only as a last resort, as it is super sweet & with a minimal p'fruit taste.) I made my own pastry crust, adding ground macadamia nuts to further elicit the flavors of Hawaii. Lastly, I cooked 2 thick syrups of pomegranate & of p'fruit to drizzle over the plated slices. Beautiful jewel tones! This was an easy pie to make.

I like this recipe and have made it several times using fresh lilikoi from my yard.  However, the one thing I changed was the crust.  Make your own crust!  Homemade crust is so much better - whether graham cracker or I have made a pastry crust with crushed macadamia nuts.

TOO rubbery - reduce gelatin to 1 packet.
TOO sweet - reduce sugar in egg white mixture to 1/2 cup!

This recipe is to die for! I made it with frozen lilikoi concentrate (found in frozen fruit juice section) and it was a great hit after our Thanksgiving meal. I live in Hawaii and have lilikoi growing in my yard, but happened to be on the Mainland when I made this recipe.  It was lucious and creamy and I wish I had made two pies. Great recipe...mahalo!

Just what I was looking for! I live 5 minutes from Hamura's and LOVE their pie. Wanted to duplicate it and this is it! Used fresh lilikoi juice and a homemade crust. Thanks for sharing....think I'll have another piece :)

I used one packet of gelatin, less sugar, and orange peel instead of lemon.  My husband loved it.  Next time, I'll make my own crust. I've got lilikoi growing wild in my yard... thanks for the recipe!

I tried this using the suggests reduced sugar and gelatin. very good but I might try reducing the sugar a little more, and perhaps reducing the lemon zest as well, so the passion fruit taste comes through more strongly.  Make it in advance if you can because it tastes better the next day!

Recipe could use a bit more detail as to what temperature to get the yolk mixture. I used about 1 tbsp sugar for the yolks and 5 tbsp for the whites. Don't be overly cautious like me and not fold the whites fully in fear of deflation! Undermixed, the texture is straight-up foam. It makes up for it in taste, but I can't wait to try this again and achieve the texture I fell in love with also at Hamura's in Kauai. I made my own crust out of 1 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup passionfruit butter cookies! Could've baked it for more crunch...

Loved this recipe.  Cut the sugar in the meringue to 1/2 cup.
perfectly light. Made with fresh lilikoi fruit.
