This was delicious! I already had katsu sauce so I only tried the chicken so far, but it was PERFECT!

Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. This was the first time I cooked chicken in my air fryer. Will certainly do so again!

This is such a amazing recipe I doubled the recipe did half in the air fryer& half in grapeseed oil on the stove. They both turned out amazing I couldn’t even tell the difference between the two neither could my party. I made this two weeks ago I’m making it again, I have the whole neighborhood raving about my chicken katsu

Super easy and delicious recipe! I ended up air frying at 400 for 20 minutes, flipping half way. I needed the extra time and temperature to get the browning.

Yes I made it and it was delish , I did use a sweet and sour sauce instead of making the sauce listed on this recipe,  I also added a few red pepper flakes to the flour mixture before coating the chicken ....

Was pretty good! For the Katsu sauce I substituted brown sugar for honey.

Loved it and the sauce made more than I thought so I doubled it and it was more than I needed so I’ll use it on other dishes

This one’s a winner! Super easy and quick. Will definitely be making this again. Made sure the chicken is no more that a quarter inch thin.

The chicken turned out lovely. Juicy inside, crisp outside. The Tonkatsu sauce however suffered a bit of failure on my part, I think. My Worcestershire was at the bottom of the bottle so it may have been on the strong side. I ended up with it overpowering the sauce. Once I added it on top of the chicken, though, it was pretty good. Next time I will start with a teaspoon, taste, and add more if necessary. Still, the dish is making in on my 'make again' list.

My Air Fryer is kind of powerful, so I had to reduce the time to 16 minutes (8, flip and spray, then 8) at 350.  Sometimes 14 for smaller batches.

Good recipe, but without the sauce, it was a bit too bland.  Adding stuff like garlic powder, ginger powder, and/or a bit of sake might not be bad.

This is absolutely delicious!!!! Family enjoyed it as well. I'll definitely be making this again. And it was made in the air fryer.
