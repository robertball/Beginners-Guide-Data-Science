You can add pancake syrup to these "cookies" because that's exactly what they were. Not the best.

Sure it's basically pancakes so switch it up a bit. We made it dairy and gluten free by substituting almond flour for the wheat flour and almond milk for the water. We used 1/2 teaspoon of stevia powder. My family ate the whole batch right off the griddle. Some topped them cakes with butter and some with jelly and some ate them plain. We thought they were great. They may even become our picnic sandwich bread (and the kids still think they're eating cookies).
