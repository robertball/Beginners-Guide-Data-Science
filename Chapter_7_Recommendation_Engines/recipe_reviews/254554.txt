How can something this simple to make taste this good!  I needed a little summer pick-me-up on a January night and all the fruit I had was organic frozen strawberries.  The Chef reluctantly mentioned that frozen fruit can be used (if you must.).  :)  My skepticism grew while mixing the crumb topping - it seemed too dry and simple - but I resisted the urge to alter the recipe.  Since the strawberries were still frozen when I put them in the oven, I watched for the fruit to be bubbling over the crust at the entire circumference of the pan.  This ended up adding about 12 minutes of baking time.  Perhaps the previous reviewers didn't adjust baking time for frozen filling, but there was nothing soupy about how this treat turned out.  The ratio of effort-to-outcome of this recipe is off the charts .

I made this with fresh blackberries and followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!  Not too much liquid at all.  I recommend using fresh (not frozen) fruit.  Thanks for another excellent recipe, Chef John!

This was simple and delicious. I used about 3 cups fresh blueberries and about 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries.  Like other people suggested, I would double the topping amount, as I like a higher crisp to fruit ratio:)  Great, easy recipe for fresh fruit!  Oh, and I noticed it didn't specify a baking dish size!  I used an 11.5" X 8.5".  Worked perfectly.

Quite good-- made a few tweaks: added two cans of sliced peaches since my (thawed) bag of frozen mixed berries wasn't enough; added two tbsp flour to fruit mixture; baked almost an hour. Not too soupy-- good texture.

Delicious! I do wish the liquid would've came out a bit thicker, but in all fairness, I did use fresh/frozen berries. I did a mix of blackberries, raspberries and strawberries...sooooo good! Served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top...the whole family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this and asked me to make it again next week! This couldn't have been easier. A definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used freshly picked blackberries from my yard.  I read reviews that this was a bit watery so I mixed 1/3 cup flour in with blackberries and I did NOT find it soupy at all.  My blackberries may not have been 100% ripe as I used the full amount of sugar and still found this slightly tart.  Pretty good way to use up my abundance of blackberries.

Fallowed the recipe with out any changes. The topping was perfect. The Blackberry's were very delicious. There was how ever quite a bit of juice in the bottom. The fresh berry's were very large so they may have been juicer (is that's even a word lol ) than a regular Blackberry. Over ice cream it worked out ok. Only had two servings that evening, so I set the pan with a trivet under one end. The next morning I used the juice that drained down on my waffle. I think next time I will add a tbs. of flour to the berry mix. Thanks Chef John you did provide me with the best chew recipe I have ever made. I'm sure it will get paired with many other fruits in the future.

Excellent, however I did take advice and cut down on the sugar to half. I used Paula  Red apples a little tart which really complimented the topping well. The topping was amazing, stayed crispy until the next day.
I actually liked  it cool. 
Thanks again Chef John

I have made this twice now.  We have lots of blackberries in the yard so I tripled the recipe and added 1/3 cup of tapioca flour to the berry mixture.  Then I up the cinnamon and add 1 tsp. cardamom.  I also added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the oat mixture (which I put on the top and the bottom of the crisp.  Everyone loves it.

When my friends and I made it, it took just less then half of an hour to prep and cook and after that, with a little vanilla ice cream it was the perfect taste and balance with the warn blackberry crisp and the cold ice cream.

Great as is. Thanks for sharing. Hardest part is waiting for it to cool. Did add walnuts to the topping, but right amount of topping to fresh berries.

So we used about 6 cups of blackberries so we doubled the crisp topping. It was amazing.... Especially with vanilla ice cream. We would definitely make it again.

So on Christmas eve I was exhausted and couldn't bring myself to make a pie crust but needed to be at dinner at 6. Woke up from my nap at 3pm and found this recipe. I used my recipe for blackberry pie for the filling (6 cups frozen blackberries drained, 1/3 cup both sugar and cornstarch 1 tsp Cinnamon) and doubled the crumble topping. Best. Dessert. Ever! This is sooooooo yum.

I love Chef John's recipes! I doubled the topping and added  1-1/2 times the berries - I baked in 2 foil smaller loaf pans - perfect ratio! Gifted our next door neighbors one of them. Watch the time. I left in the oven a few minutes longer and the berries came out a bit shriveled. Tasty tho!

Simple flavors and easy to make. I had very large blackberries so I cut them in half to make it cool down better. Worked perfectly!

Changes -  my blackberries were sweet so I did not coat in white sugar, but I coated in 1/4 cup of flour instead so my crisp was not watery as other reviewers have experienced.  Next time I will try cornstarch.  I did not add lemon juice or cinnamon - but next time I will add cinnamon to the topping) and I doubled the topping.  I used brown sugar splenda instead of regular brown sugar.   I had to add a little more butter.  My family enjoyed it.  I was not crazy about all the seeds in the blackberries.

A very good, straightforward crisp recipe for blackberries!

Picked up some fresh blackberries a day ago and, alas, they were not sweet. In fact, they were fairly tart, so wanted to put them to good use in a way that made the most of them. And as I love crisps, went looking for a crisp recipe and found this one.

Definitely a good recipe for a blackberry crisp, but would advise modifying depending on taste preferences.

I made two changes to the recipe. First, given that our blackberries were not sweet, I upped the white sugar from 1/3 cup to just under 1/2 cup. Definitely the right call and would advise that for anyone working with fresh blackberries that are not sweet, unless you are seeking a less sweet berry mix to contrast to the crisp topping.

Second, I like crisps with a LOT of crisp topping and, given that, and given other reviews about the amount of topping being too little for the amount of berries, I doubled the crisp topping.  Again, absolutely the right call. Even if you don't have a penchant for extra thick crisp toppings, still would advise going 1.5x the recipe portions for the topping.

BUT, none of that is a criticism of the recipe! A great recipe, one that I fiddled with to accommodate my berries and taste!!!

Tasted delicious but not enough topping for the blackberries.  The juice boiled through and was soggy, no crisp.  A bit disappointed.

Tasty, easy and forgiving. Put extra cinnamon directly on the fruit also, Made the topping generous. Got nice and almost crispy, soaked berry juices in a really yummy way.

Everyone liked it especially with ice cream.  I've been eating healthier lately and I felt good about eating it (without ice cream of course).  Regarding changes, I used a frozen mixed berry I bought at Costco for my smoothies and I thought it was juicier than the Chef's fresh blackberry base, so I made 50% more of the crumble topping and had to bake for 53 minutes.  I would make it exactly the same when I make it again.

I made this because I am finally not working crazy hours and wanted to celebrate.  My husband who doesn't like dessert at all and he tried to take mine.  Super easy to make and definitely fresh is best.

Turned out like blackberry soup with oats on top, mostly liquid. Tasted ok.
