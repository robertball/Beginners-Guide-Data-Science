Great Dish!  I love making meatloaf dinners, always trying to do something different.  We like our meatloaf a bit spicy, so I added more Italian spice, some dried basil, some red pepper flakes, and more garlic than what was called for.  I also added some grated parma cheese on top.  DELISH!  Thank you for posting this great recipe.  Its a keeper!

This meatloaf was delicious!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and me and my husband really enjoyed this one!  I actually don't like the taste of meatloaf made with ketchup so when I found a meatloaf recipe made with tomato soup, I jumped on it!  It was great :-)  Thank you!
