These are yummy. Needed something to  bring to  a friends house. Perfect plain but topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, caramel sauce and whipped cream made me a happy girl!

This was great! The brownie mix was awesome, but I think the cooking time was way too much. I took mine out around 32 minutes but I still think 25-28 minutes would have been much better bc they were slightly dry. But super easy and delicious!

These were great!! I have made cookie brownies from a box before but they didn't even compare to these! They had a great taste and were fun to make!

I made the tollhouse cookie dough recipe with a brownie batter mix.  I could not get the brownie and cookie to well... cook.  Maybe I used too much cookie dough batter, but these were mush even after an hour plus of cooking.  Was not worth my time.

These cookie brownies were just ok. I made it as directed in the recipe, no changes. Chocolate flavor not as rich as I'd like and the blend of chocolate chip cookies with brownies, that sounds dreamy, did not come through as I anticipated. Maybe if the cookie dough was homemade it might have been better mixed with a quality brownie mix. I have never been a big fan of premade cookie dough so that could be why I thought it was meh. I have two teenage sons - one liked the cookie-brownies and one did not. Thanks for the recipe because the idea of mixing these two scrumptious sweets is fabulous!

Made for Valentine's Day the day before.  Used a heart shaped springform pan. Baked for around 30 minutes and it turned out great,  very  moist. A simple and  cute way to celebrate Valentine's Day.

This is very filling, sweet, and easy.  It is more crumbly than I expected, but I will definitely make it again!
