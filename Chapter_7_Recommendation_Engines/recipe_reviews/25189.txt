I make the same thing, but I cheat. I buy a pre-made crust, pre-made alfredo sauce, cooked refridgerated chicken, and I even put some pre-cooked bacon on it too (just make sure you are not using the "flavored" bacon) mine is ready in about 15 minutes, the kids will not eat regular pizza anymore, just this.

I've made this pizza several times - with company.  It is always a pleasant surprise because each time, I top it with whatever fresh veggies I have on hand.  The only consistent issue I have is that the sauce needs nearly twice as much liquid to make it "spreadable", which is fine, and the crust does not taste "cooked" in 20 minutes.  I made this again yesterday and I find that when the crust is "lightly browned" it's not enough cooking for the crust beneath the toppings.  When I reheated the leftovers for 20 more minutes @350, the crust became the perfect texture.  I love this recipe though, so make it your own.

I was searching for something quick and different to fix with chicken breasts and came across this recipe.  I was under a big time constraint, so I took some shortcuts by using a prepared alfredo sauce (already in my cabinet), and then I grilled the chicken breasts using the George Foreman grill to expedite things. Even though you don't let the dough rise in this recipe, it still made a nice crust.  The combination of the rosemary and thyme seasonings (along with the green onions and mushrooms I added) gave this pizza a "gourmet feel," and it really impressed my family, who came home & thought that I had bought it from Papa Murphy's!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I give this recipes 5 stars!!! it was so good that I wanted to make it again the day after I made the first one.  I had to make a change in the recipe, being that I didn't have any rosemary, so I used poultry seasoning instead.   I also made the pizza with sauted spinach as a topping along with the chicken and it was so good!! I'm going to make this as an appetizer as well and make it in a 9x13 pan or a jelly roll and cut it into small squares.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Incredible!  A little bit of work to make all the different items, but well worth it!  I added broccoli.  I also did not have any rosemary, so I used some oregano and thyme from my garden and loved it.  The leftovers were even fabulous!

I didn't care for this pizza too much. The crust was good. I used 1 tablespoon of gluten to add flavor. It was good crust. Good for any kind of pizza and will make the crust again. 
I think it might have been the rosemary. I didn't like the spices in it. 
I did like the chicken seasoning. That was very good. 
But the alfredo sauce was good but next time I won't add pepper. 
Overall I probably won't make this pizza again.

It was very rich.  I added onions, tomatoes, mushrooms and broccoli.  The fresh veggies made it much more appealling.

We are always on the look out for new pizza recipes since we got our wood fired oven.  I have made this twice now for company and we have really enjoyed it.   I make one slight addition and top with mushrooms to give a bit of colour.

Take a break from Pepperoni Pizza. Our family has home made pizza every Friday. This is the ONLY pizza that my daughter will eat. 

Great flavor - Do not be afraid to go extra heavy on the garlic and pepper. All the oil makes it a bit heavy. I throw a little cheese on my side, because Pizza "has to have" cheese!

Amazing. Only made one change; out of thyme, subbed marjoram. Too many people trying to change this recipe; using all the store bought stuff makes it a whole different pizza. Definitely worth the extra effort! Update: made this again. Next time I would like to try mixing the chicken with the sauce before topping the pizza; turning each piece was a little time consuming. I made a full recipe of dough and garlic butter, half recipe of sauce and chicken; used the other half of dough and butter to make DBF his pepperoni. Yum.

Delicious recipe.  Instead of chicken, I used shrimp and crab.  My family was certainly impressed.  The rosemary added an interesting flavor, though my sister didn't care for it.  The pizza crust itself would be great for any type of pizza.  I couldn't believe it didn't need to rise!

My family was not greatly impressed by this recipe.  If I were to make this again, it would be with some drastic changes: the crust is to cakey and the alfredo sauce tastes like bottled sauce.  Finding a recipe for a crispier crust and using the recipe from this site for 'To die for Fettucine alfredo' sauce would definitely make this better.  Sorry

I like to make 100% sure that my crust is done and a no-fail way to do that is to partially cook the crust before you put on the toppings. I always cook it for about 7-10 minutes for a thin crust and about 15 for a thick crust. If you put on the alfredo sauce right after the crust comes out of the oven it spreads much easier, also. A delicious recipe!

The crust was soooo easy to make. I'll have to use it on any pizza we make homemade. I also enjoyed the uniqueness of the sauce and toppings. I thought it could have used a lot more chicken, though, and I might try throwing on some vegetables next time. overall- this was a keeper at my  house.

This was fantastic!  I left off the garlic butter (just a personal preference - didn't want to add more fat & I didn't think it would add all that much flavor).  I cheated and used a pre-cooked/pre-seasoned chicken breast (just 1 was plenty because of all the vegetables I added).  I added 1 sliced red bell pepper, 1 can artichokes (roughly chopped), and 1 pkg sliced fresh mushrooms.  I made the mistake of putting the sauce on and letting it sit for 45 minutes or so (I got distracted), and it made the crusty a bit doughy in the middle.  Will definitely make this again though.  Thanks for the recipe!

After making this recipe multiple times I have made some changes: add a couple minced garlic cloves (sautéed in the butter) to Alfredo sauce, omit garlic butter.  We like to add any of the following: mushrooms, red peppers, red or green onions, chopped fresh spinach, and bacon (not all together, of course,) to change things up a bit. Its a family favorite.

Made this tonight and the whole family liked it. I personally Loved it. The alfredo sauce is wonderful (I will add garlic next time). I think some onions and diced tomatoes will add a nice touch next time as well.

I cooked it on my large Pampered Chef round stone. Whenever I do pizza on my stone I put down a light dusting of corn meal before I roll it out. Then bake it on the lowest rack setting in my oven for the 1st 2/3rds of the cooking time. It really helps the dough cook when there are lots of wet toppings. I then move it to the middle or just above the middle. 

Next time I will use my stone with sides (large bar pan) as the butter dripped off and made for a nice smoky kitchen. Oops! 

I will definitely make this again!

Excellent pizza!  My husband almost ate the whole thing by himself!  I added fresh mushrooms to the garlic butter and topped it with mozzarella.  I used a store bought crust....a little laziness on my part but it was still very good.

I was looking for a recipe for white sauce to put on a pizza and decided to use the one included in this recipe. It was quick to prepare and had incredible flavor... rich and creamy, just what I was looking for. In addition to the sauce, I topped my pizza with fresh roma tomatoes, shrimp, basil leaves and mozzerella. Highly reccomended.

This was great my husband loved it, was a little greasy for my taste, so I will probably put the garlic butter on more sparinly next time. There will definately be a next time.

Very good.  My husband and I loved this.  I added shredded mozzarella to the top of this pizza - I just can't see having pizza without some kind of cheese topping.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this with Parmesan instead of Romano, and didn't spice the chicken.  I need to make again, because its mostly right, and probably will be awesome made with the right stuff.  The sauce needed something and overall the chicken needed that flavor to get it there.

I have made this pizza twice now and both times have turned out.  The first time I made this recipe I followed everything to the t (except I added mushroom and onion for a little more flavor).  The pizza turned out good, but I was a little disapointed on the flavor of the alfredo sauce.  Determined to make an absolutely amazing pizza, I took another reviewers suggestion and used "To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo" recipe. OH-MY-GOSH. Best Idea ever!! So this is what I did--prepared the crust as the ingrediants called for, but I let my dough rise. I doubled the garlic butter and then prebaked the pizza at 350 for 12 minutes so the wont be soggy.  Then I made the "To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo" and added an extra heap of minced garlic.  I used shredded slow cooker chicken and mixed it into the alfredo sauce and poured it onto the pizza. Then of course I added shredded mozzerella cheese. I baked at 425 for about 20 minutes then put the broil on high for about 1 minute to cook the cheese a little extra (watch like a hawk if you do this so you don't burn your pizza!) Seriously, Amazing.  Overall great recipe, but giving 4 stars as I was not impressed with the alredo sauce.  Good luck!!

We tried this delicious dish and the entire family loved it!  I have one in the family allergic to tomatoes so now I can make a pizza for the entire family!

It would have been good as written, but I can never leave well enough alone. And it was really really tasty! I am sure the other way would have been okay also, but I added more seasonings, and some green peppers, mushrooms, black olives, onions, and a little cheese to the top. The teens I left all the veggies off, except for the dried onions, dried celery, and dried red peppers that I cooked in with the chicken & sauce.

This pizza is my favorite homemade pizza to make. Sometimes we use this sauce, but when we want something a little easier we just sauce from a jar. The sauce here is much better and has so much flavor! The seasoning for the chicken is amazing! Perfect combo of spices.

This was a pretty good Chicken Alfredo Pizza (my first time attempting one at home) I think I needed to cook it a little longer though as my Alfredo was a little liquidy- husband loved it though so will definately be making again! BTW Crust is perfect!!!

Holy canola oil, this is VERY good! The crust was very very easy, except next time I make it I'm going to use a little less flour! I added more sauce which was needed as I think it would have been too dry without it (although my crust could be to blame there.) I added red bell peppers, green onions, and fresh basil to mine. Sooo good! I would agree with others and say that you should cook it a bit longer! The crust wasn't done enough for me! 
My boyfriend can't wait until I make this next time! :)

used a ready made crust...jarred Alfredo sauce....sauted onion with mushrooms and half a pkg of well drained frozen spinach. Added precooked chicken. Since i used jarred sauce, i sprinkled a generous amount of Parmesan cheese on top and topped with sun dried tomatoes.

Ok taste, but make sure your pizza stone has a lip on it, the garlic butter ran out all over the bottom of my oven and the smoke alarms went off the whole cooking time.  :(

Yummy!  I did cheat and used the Pillsbury rolled pizza crust in the refrigerator section instead of making dough, and I prebaked it for 8 minutes before adding the toppings.  Made the garlic butter in the microwave so I'd have one less thing going on the stove.  Cut up the raw chicken breasts, added the seasonings and cooked in a skillet.  Mixed the cheese sauce and chicken before putting on the crust and baked for an additional 8 minutes.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is add some veggies - I was thinking red peppers for color!

This was the best pizza I have made so far. The dough was perfect, the sauce and garlic butter were both delicious and added so much flavor. I added baby bella mushrooms and red bell pepper for a slight change to the recipe, but it would have been just as flavorful without them. Fantastic recipe!

I thought this recipe was great! It was a huge hit at our house. I followed the recipe exactly, lots of work, but I thought it was worth it. I baked the crust for 10 minutes, then topped and baked for the 20 minutes. The crust was perfectly crunchy and chewy. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! This was so good! For the chicken I marinated 2 chicken breasts in italian dressing and then grilled them and chopped them up. So I didn't add the seasonings to the chicken like it says. For the sauce I used cream and I ended up using 2 cups to get the consistency I wanted, which left me with leftover sauce, but that wasn't a bad thing. I also made my own favorite pizza dough recipe for this. I layered it just like it says and I put some shredded colby-jack cheese on top. I would give this one 10 stars if I could! THANKS!

Great with a few changes: I tried the sauce on Round I - and thought it came out terrible. Maybe have been the cheese I was using - but I won't be trying it again regardless. Used "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" from this site - and it is fantasitc. I cut the sauce recipe in half so I don't have so much leftover. Used a frozen pizza dough ball - thawed in the fridge - and also incorporated spinach. We LOVE this pizza. It is better than any gourmet alfredo pizza I've had. The seasoning for the chicken is great - and I like the addition of the garlic butter.

I added some Roma tomatoes, green onions, mushrooms, and some additional Romano Cheese to the topping of this pizza.  It turned out wonderful.  However, maybe I use a smaller pizza stone, but my crust was incredibly thick.  I think that there was probably enough dough for 2 pizzas for my smaller pizza stone.

This was good. We used whole wheat flour for the crust and topped with spinach, mushrooms, onion and italian cheese as well. We did use about 1/2 cup less alfredo than called for. Also, prebake crust for about 7-10 minutes before you cook the rest of the pizza

This pizza is amazing. Even my god children, who normally don't eat "white sauce" went back for seconds. But, I have to admit, I did cheat by using store bought pizza crust.

I made this today for lunch. I served it with a side salad. My father loved it, my mom and I liked it and my husband ate it but I don't think he was to impressed. My daughter would not eat it at all. I have to say it was pretty time consuming and made for alot of pots to wash. I don't think I would make it again. It just wasn't worth all the trouble.

Simply amazing.  This is the BEST pizza I have EVER had.  The only changes I made are that I added finely cut spinach and tomatoes to the cooked alfredo sauce.  People who wanted to "thin" the alfredo...guess what...this is your CHEESE topping.  You don't thin that.  Do not top this with mozz. cheese. You are ruining it by doing that and changing it from a perfect specialty pizza to a regular pizza. No - mozz - needed.  The author made this recipe absolutely perfect, don't change it. If you wanna add veggies, I'd recommend doing that at the end and just throwing them in the alfredo sauce before you spread it on the pizza.  Only other small thing I changed is I baked the pizza crust on a pizza stone for 5 minutes before topping it and I added more rosemary to the crust than called for (about twice as much).  SO good!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I've tried several chicken/garlic/alfredo pizza recipes from this site & this is the BEST! Hubby said it was his favorite pizza ever.  I made it mostly by the book but used heavy cream instead of milk & I always pre-bake my crust before adding the sauce & toppings.  I also added green & red peppers & mushrooms.

I made this mostly by the recipe, but I used store bought crust.  I made the sauce first which had somewhat of a werid texture becuase of the cheese I think.  I tasted ok, but it was very thick and when leftovers were re-heated, it was not saucy at all.  For the chicken I sauted it in some minced garlic, butter, olive oil, and herbs(I still used pre-cooked chicken).  Overall I would give it a 4.  It does taste VERY diferent when you make the sauce opposed to using a jarred sauce.  If you make it using a jar sauce, it isn't going to turn out as good.  I have made it both ways and I was going to use jarred sauce again last night, but I realized I was out at the last minute and had to make the sauce in the recipe instead.  Turned out much better!

I thought this was really good... my husband found it a little bland though. I made my own pizza crust because I have a tried and true recipe of my own, and I added green onions and red pepper. But, otherwise I kept it exactly the same. I don't really see the need for the butter so I think next time I would add the garlic and rosemary to the Alfredo sauce and amp up the flavor a bit. Over all a great recipe... just tweak it to your liking.

This was my 1st time ever attempting to make a homemade pizza and I think it turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe to the exact. The pizza was delicious, I made 2 because I wasn't sure how much it would make (feeding a family of 4) and 1 would have been plenty, but we didn't mind the leftovers. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because next time I will add some heavy cream or milk to the alfredo sauce to help make it a little bit more creamier and double up on the garlic sauce. Tip: Instead of placing the alfredo sauce on 1st then putting the chicken on top and turn to coat, I just tossed the chicken with the alfredo sauce 1st to coat very well then spread it over the pizza dough. Great recipe! We all loved it! I will be making this again for the fam!

Loved this! To make it easier and healthier, I used whole wheat crust, Ragu light alfredo sauce, part skim mozzerella.  Also added mushrooms (sauteed in garlic) and red onion and it was absolutely fantastic!

This was a great pizza!  My husband loved it and I have made it twice in one week.  I did use colby and montery jack cheese instead of Ramon and Pizza Crust 1.  It still turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This pizza was the best I have ever had! I used half and half instead of the milk as I was out of milk.  I used some left over cooked cubed chicken from one I used for chicken stock.  I topped with green onions, tomatoes and mozzarella and a little garlic salt!  Yummy!

This was phenomenal!  It was actually pretty easy to make.  We rubbed the seasoning on the chicken and grilled on the George Foreman grill then cut it up.  I added a little cheese to the pizza too.  I don't like pizza unless its chicken alfredo, and I'm REALLY picky about my alfredo sauce.  The garlic sauce was great too.  Words cannot express how much this recipe rocks!

Maybe I should've followed recipe directions for the crust and sauce, and I would've liked it better.  I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust(from this sauce) and jarred alfredo sauce.  The garlic butter was very tasty, and I'll use that in bread recipes!  Fiance liked this better than I did.  Not something I plan to go out of my way to make again, but glad I tried.

My four year old who hates pizza loved this!  I added a pizza blend cheese at 10 min. into the baking on half of it.  We all liked the side just a little bit letter with the cheese on top.  I just sprinkled a little on.  Was super yummy! I did bacon, chicken and onion.

Best pizza dough I have ever found. I mix it in my  kitchen aid stand mixer. Also it is great with the herbs listed or changing the herbs to fit your taste. My peanut utter and jelly only son even loves this crust! :)

I made this using pre-made alfredo sauce and in place of the rosemary used oregano.  I also put cheese on top of the sauce.  This is a great pizza! The crust is the best I've made so far

An excellent pizza!  We only added a sprinkle of mozzarella on top, towards the end of baking.  A little labor-intensive, but well worth it.  Where we live, there are no good restaurants and certainly no good pizza parlours, so this was a treat.  The dough is simple and well worth doing from scratch.  This is a keeper.

I loved the idea but made "easy" changes.  Used pre-made crust and Ragu alfredo sauce.  Also added bacon to top and green onions.  Delicious and irresistable.  Thanks so much for the idea!

The sauce is amazing (maybe a little more salt) and I needed a lot more milk than the recipe called for just to get it to a consistency that I could spread. But it was nice because I had extra alfredo sauce (also, I didn't have Romano, and so I used Parmesan which was amazing)  The crust has an amazing flavor (although, my husband prefers a fluffier crust, so I would probably add more yeast next time) As for toppings: Grilled chicken, bacon crumbles, green onions and roma tomatoes;  I would do more toppings next time. Especially tomatoes, bacon and green onions.

I've made it exactly as prescribed and with changes, too. One change I made the most recent time was rather than chicken, I used sausage. I still used the alfredo sauce, but perhaps combine the alfredo and marinara or use only marinara when using sausage. I also have added chopped tomatoes on top, and on top of that, one half - shredded cheddar jack cheese, the other half - shredded romano cheese. Biggest factor of this pizza turning out is getting the dough made correctly concerning the yeast activating sufficiently, kneeding the dough, & the dough rising. If the dough is good, forming a crust is easy. I use a 9x13 pan or slightly larger.

Goodness! I wish I could give 10 stars. I have tried a lot of pizza crusts. This was extraordinary. I do not know how we get the perfect texture in just one rise. I am in love with this pizza. I used veggie meatballs instead of chicken and added some veggies that I had on hand. I used half bread flour and half whole wheat flour for the crust. The only other thing I do differently is that heat the oven to the highest temperature and keep the tray as close to heat as possible. I bake for only 8-10 minutes. You get a crisp base and soft melting top! PERFECT! I have not made a better crust even though I have made pizza more than a hundred times!

Great recipe! I added caramelized onions onto the pizza as well and sprinkled it with mozzarella cheese as well.  Served with garlic bread. Next time, I won't put as much romano cheese. I'm not familiar with its taste and find it a little too pungent.

VERY GOOD! I made this on a whim because i thought it sounded good. The White sauce was REALLY good. I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano since i had none and it still turned out great! Everything was very simple. I also added some fresh spinach from the garden because i thought it would add color and i always add spinach to my alfredo. The dough does rise a lot in the oven so it's better to spread it thinner than you would like to so that the end result is perfect! Very yummy recipe- will make again!  (also i just cut up a chicken breast into chunks and sauted it in olive oil with all of the seasonings since i didn't have a roasted chicken and it still turned out Delicious!)

I thought this was really good.  Will definitely make again.  The chicken I cooked in olive oil with the seasonings.  One suggestion I would make is to bake the crust for 5 minutes before adding the sauce.  I do this with my crust for any pizza I make, then you don't have to worry about the crust not being done under all the toppings.  If you do this first, it will only take about 12-14 min to finish up.  I also added fresh mushrooms and a little mozzarella on the top.  Great recipe. Thanks!!!

This was really good, but like others have said, it was really wet. Is the solution to just use less sauce or cook the water out? I'll make it again but likely not very regularly.

I just made this pizza for dinner, as written, and wasn't really impressed.  The crust is great, I will probably use the crust recipe again, the cheese sauce was tasty, but seemed to be absorbed into the crust.  I really didn't care for the chicken.  I agree with another reviewer that it might be good as an appetizer, but I think I would omit the chicken and add vegetables (mushrooms, spinach, maybe broccoli, and possibly some sun dried tomatoes).  As written, I probably won't make again.

As another member already said... you can make this a lot easier with ready made pizza crust, sprinkle light olive oil, ready made alfredo sauce, then your favorite herbs(Italian and Basil for me) then the package precooked strips(usually with the deli meats, they even have a southwestern flavor that is great)  then top it off with pizza cheese bake about 15 mins or according to cooking directions on pizza crust.  So very yummy!  Easy and quick!

Ionly made the alfredo sauce for a pizza dough i already had...  I thought the sauce was too thick and I needed to add more liquid...   I just added more milk until it was a spreadable consistency!  I was out of Romano so used parm... It worked well!

The crust seemed a little heavy and the sauce a little too rich/thick.  But these could've just been my fault and not the recipes at all.  overall, it was very good.

This recipe was quite good. I subbed a cup of the flour for whole wheat with no problems. I also added onions, mushrooms  and red pepper - it just didn't look right without any veggies. I also added a bit of mozzerella.  The alfredo sauce tasted ok, it had a nice creamy texture, but it tasted like it was missing something. It needed a bit of zing I think. Overall 4 stars. Will make again and see what I can do with it.

What an AWESOME pizza! We've made homemade pizzas every Sunday night for the last 12 years. We try different crusts, different ingredients, different styles. Last Sunday I had some extra chicken thawed out and thought about a chicken pizza. We LOVE Papa Murphy's Garlic Chicken Pizza so I thought I'd try my hand at something similar. I found this recipe! YUM! I can't tell you how delicious this is. I did use a jar of garlic alfredo sauce I had instead of making the sauce that's listed and I sauteed garlic with the chicken in olive oil. The seasonings are delicious! My kids were asking if we could have it again on Monday night! :-) We LOVED IT!

I followed the recipe for the sauce and it was AMAZING. I did add close to a tbsp. minced garlic to the butter, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the sauce on a Pillsbury pizza crust, and topped with sauteed shrimp, spinach, and artichoke.  The sauce really made the pizza.  Thanks!

I totally cheated but it was still great. I used a pre-baked crust, jar alfredo sauce, and a store bought rotisserie chicken. I did saute my own onions, mushrooms & red peppers in a little butter. I also added mozzarella cheese and bacon. Better than a pizzeria.

This was sooo good! i only made the alfredo sauce and i did change it alittle. first i added 3 cloves of garlic to the butter. i also used white pepper and added a good pinch of herbs de provence. i think next time i'll add alittle more flour to thicken the sauce alittle more. i then added chicken,artichoke hearts,green olives and feta cheese! i cheated and used a box pizza dough mix. it turned out AWESOME!!! even my 11yr.old loved it!i told all my friends. will make this over and over again. thanks for a delicious sauce!!!

Fantastic base recipe ! Our family absolutely loved this recipe . I did make a few changes like I made it deep dish by putting it into a cast iron pan . I topped the crust with a bed of fresh spinach and and chopped garlic . I followed that with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Finished it off with the chicken tomatoes and chopped green onions ! Wow ! A permanent in our rotation !

Overall, I like that this recipe is completely from scratch and includes every aspect of the recipe in the instructions. the downside is that this is the blandest pizza I have had. I added a clove of garlic to the butter because I love garlic, but the Alfredo sauce didn't call for any garlic. This whole pizza put together with all the spices and herbs somehow managed to have no flavor. I'm just going to stick to using my separate recipes for each section of the pizza.

After not having a kitchen for 3 years, I have eagerly waited to make this pizza again.  By far my favorite pizza of all time.  Nix the rosemary though, chicken should taste like chicken.  Probably going to kill me but I always top with 1 lb of mozzarella.   Heart attack at 400 degrees!

If you made short cuts it likely didn't come out well. But I tried it today and it came out wonderfully. At the request of my family added bacon to it. I added more salt to the sauce to taste. And I will likely do this again with chopped tomatoes and kale too. Try it!!!

For the sauce 1 cup of milk was too little... it actually took me 3 cups of milk to make the sauce and it was just enough to cover the pizza. The final result was creamy and yummy. I don't think it would work just with 1 cup anyways.

Even with a store-bought dough, this was great! We added mushrooms, more peppers and mozzarella cheese on top but it turned out perfect. I didn't have Alfredo sauce so I made my own with milk, Parmesan cheese and minced garlic. Perfect!

So good!  We have a child with a tomato allergy, so we are always on the look-out for a pizza that she can eat. Both our picky young kiddos ate their pieces up without complaint!  The only change I made was to skip the garlic butter and instead saute the chicken and some frozen broccoli florets I added in garlic butter.  I then mixed the sauce with the chicken/broccoli mixture and added some shredded Parmesan cheese on top before baking (we just couldn't imagine pizza without at least a little cheese ;).  Everything about it was great...it was rich and filling without being too heavy like most alfredos, and the crust was amazing (we used 1/2 white 1/2 wheat flour and made the dough in the bread maker).  This is a great basic recipe that you can tweak to your mood/tastes (we might try some black olives, spinach or mushrooms in the future...although the basic chicken/broccoli will be our go-to from now on :)

Great recipe! I made a few tweaks and this pizza turned out restaurant quality. I had never made my own pizza dough or Alfredo sauce, but it turned out very good.

-stuffed outside crust with honey goat cheese & extra Romano cheese
-Buttered the outside crust after stuffed and sprinkled garlic powder on it so it was much like a garlic bread stick on the outside
-Added a bit of garlic salt, pepper & Romano to the Alfredo sauce, as it was a bit bland beforehand. If you do this, be sure to watch how much you add and taste as you add
-Added tomato in with cooked chicken to pizza dough
-When pizza came out of the oven, I sprinkled Romano on top of it and garnished with baby arugula 

I tweak just about every recipe and these tweaks made this pizza amazing.

This recipe is awesome! Since I recently found out I'm allergic to tomatoes, I have really missed pizza. My husband has never tried chicken alfredo pizza, and to my surprise, he loved it also! It was the best pizza crust and alfredo sauce I have ever eaten. I will use it also for linguine alfredo. I'm never buying that so called alfredo sauce in the jar again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was a little blah even with adding onions, peppers and mushrooms. Next time I would add basil and top with sliced tomatoes and some parmesan.

Love the recipe, but kicking it up to "Fire House Cuisine" standards I had to tweak it just a bit ..... I added a liberal dose of crisp bacon and fire roasted Hatch Green Chile to the recipe! But then again that's just the way we do things in the Southwest style of cooking!

Great dish - even my 7 year old nephew loved it.... although we added mozzarella to the top of his half of the pizza!
I thought the romano cheese was too much for the portion, but I guess that depends on if you like it or not. And for some reason the dough was too sticky and I could not roll it into a loose ball until I added more flour. 

Otherwise it is a great twist on the classic chicken alfredo!!

This was super delicious!  We used pre-made pizza dough from our local store, and just sprinkled extra garlic powder and rosemary on top instead of making our own.  It was so delicious we ate and made it two nights in a row!

good taste; way too much sauce I think. I had to use cheddar cheese blend, it was all I had and had to add extra milk, wasn't creamy enough with stated amount. Did not add the garlic butter, because I forgot. But glad because it was so rich. Will make again, adjust amounts tho. Thank you!

This was pretty good.  Next time though I think I'm going to add more sauce, as my pizza seemed a little dry.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The sauce was way too thick. It did not spread and I put extra milk just to make it spread. Too much use of butter and needs more than just chicken. I put a little spinach

This is a very yummy pizza, but I found the directions misleading. for starters, it says prep time is 30 minutes but calls for letting the dough rise for the same amount of time. But most importanly, the instant yeast will not "foam" unless the sugar is add to the yeast and water mixture, NOT with the other dough ingredients as is stated. The time doesn't take in to account the prep for the yeast, dough, and assembly. I agree with others that the dough does need to be prebaked. I baked mine for 5 minutes before assembling and then an additional 20 minutes. Also, I thought the recipe called for at least a 1/2 cup too much flour for the dough. I did not have any trouble with the sauce as others discussed but I used a parm/romano blend so maybe that made a difference.

This was pretty good, had a restaraunt-style gourmet taste to it. The rosemary gave it a delicious flavor, but the dough turned out a little bit soggy on top. I might bake it first before adding toppings if I make it again.  I added red pepper strips, red onions, and topped with shredded monterey jack the last 5 min of baking. Will definitely make again!

I kept wanting to add milk to the alfredo sauce, because it seemed too thick for alfredo sauce, but then I realized this is different - it's the cheese on the pizza, so it should be thicker than your normal alfredo sauce. Delicious. Will make again.

My family LOVED this! I just cut 3 small chicken breasts up and sauted them in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic powder. I also used an italian cheese blend for the alfredo sauce. I sprinkled some on top of the finished pizza as well. Turned out amazing!!!

Good recipe. I used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of making from scratch. The dough seemed a little chewy maybe because I subbed half of the flour for whole wheat flour? Also like other review suggested I would probably prebake the dough before adding the toppings so prevent mushiness. I think I'll make again but with those changes.

loved this pizza!  We BBQ'd the chicken and added some yellow bell pepper and spinach.  The sauce is still being talked about and we made it last week!  Also added a light dusting of mozzerella cheese.  Fantastic!

I needed to speed it up, so I use a pre-made pizza dough, & my alfredo sauce which we always have extra on hand. We have this at least once a week, & my husband has started adding things like mushroom, bacon, or spinach depending on his mood!

Good recipe.  I love pasta alfredo and this was a nice twist on the classic dish.  I did add a little parmesan to the sauce.  We don't like rosemary so left it out of the dough and butter.  I also topped the pizza with baby spinach leaves for a little color and added flavor.  It was definitely yummy.  I will try this again maybe with a few more changes.  Thanks.

I thought this pizza was very good. I thought the sauce would be thick but I stired it and it became spreadable again. I didn't do the rosemary because we didn't have any at the time and it was still very yummy.

This is an excellent base recipe for an amazing pizza. I have made it several times using roasted peppers, prosciutto, artichokes, etc. Gourmet pizza at a fraction of the cost. A real time saver is buying the pizza dough from my local pizzeria. My whole family loves this recipe!

My husband and I always order this pizza from a popular local establishment... and this recipe blew them away.  We thought it was rich and flavorful, perfect for Friday movie nights!  I thinned the sauce with a tad more milk, added some diced tomatoes (from another review/tip - awesome idea!), a little fresh spinach and some mushrooms.  The crust was easy to do by hand and very soft, but it does rise quite a bit in the oven, make sure yours is fairly thin - a hit with my family!

This was a nice change!  The sauce was ok - needed more flavor and it's really not the type of alfredo you'd want on pasta, as all that flour makes it a bit pasty (in fact, I had to thin out with an additional half cup or so of milk), but for a pizza sauce it works fine.  I used garlic & herb infused olive oil instead of the butter sauce, added Italian seasoning, and added broccoli and mushrooms as topping.  I topped with just a handful of mozzarella, as it still looked as though it needed something.  I think a more traditional alfredo sauce would be more flavorful, but seeing as this version shaves off some fat and calories I was perfectly happy with it.

I made this with pre-made pizza dough and used half-n-half instead of milk for the alfredo sauce. My family loved it. My teenage son, who eats no vegetables, liked it as-is. I added spinach and mushrooms to the adults' side and mozzerella cheese all over. It was even better the next day!

As is it I would rate 3.5 stars. I added cooked crumbled bacon, chopped broccoli and sauteed red onion, then toppped it all with mozzeralla. My family loved the change from our normal pizza. I always make my own pizza dough from scratch, so it was the intersting topping that got them going. Four stars after the changes.

I tried this after falling in love with a similar pizza at my local pizzaria.  Although I still prefer the restaurant version, my husband thought this was even better.  I always go the easy route and buy a premade pizza crust, which still tastes yummy, even thought Im sure its even better with the homemade dough.

What a perfectly tasting pizza idea! I had to adapt this to a LOT of guests (and therefore, a lot of toppings,) so here are my thoughts. I opted to use All-Recipes' "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" for the dough recipe, and worked in the cheese and herbs as directed here. For the sake of time, I used a couple cans of prepared Alfredo sauce, added 3-4 oz cream cheese and 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder (to taste) I made the garlic butter and seasoned chicken as directed. (I baked and hand shredded the chicken breasts) Other toppings I added: crispy bacon and roughly chopped onion. YUMMY! Definitely a keeper. Everyone asked for more!

I'm sorry to disagree with the other ratings, but this was the WORST Alfredo sauce I've ever tasted. Especially painful was that I wasted my expensive Parmesan cheese on this & bought a fresh bottle of garlic powder. The sauce was so rich & didn't taste good to me. I'd suggest using a real alfredo sauce recipe with real toasted garlic slices - they're easy to remove & much better flavor.

This recipe features a very rich and creamy alfredo sauce which bakes up nicely on the pizza. I took a shortcut and used a ready to bake crust from a can and kneaded the seasonings into it. Was a time saver but it was hard to get the dough to cooperate in getting it to fit the pizza pan. Will try the actual dough recipe next time, or a powdered box mix if I'm short on time. I added spinach to the recipe and it came out wonderful. I also piled on the extra Romano cheese I had left over and it browned nicely.

I used my pizza crust recipe, which is why I am only giving 4 stars. The alfredo sauce turned out great. And the seasoning on the chicken was realy good. I cooked my chicken breasts on the stove top with olive oil and the seasonings, then sliced it thinly. We also added mushrooms, black olives, and onion. Then topped it all with about 1/2 cup of mozzerlla. Very good, will make again!

So, I cheated and used a pre-made Boboli wheat crust, 1/2 jar of (expensive-it matters) alfredo sauce, pre-packaged grilled chicken strips, canned sliced mushrooms, parsley, olive oil and crushed garlic (spread on crust before adding everything else). It was great! And only took about 3 minutes to prepare and 15 minutes to cook. Sorry I didn't follow the recipe, but it gave me the idea!

Very impressive gourmet style pizza!  I used Jay's Signature Pizza dough recipe from this site for the crust, and I substituted Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for the sauce instead of Romano and threw in some sliced button mushrooms and topped it with mozzarella cheese.  It re-heats very well the next day too!

this was really tasty. I changed it up a bit by skipping the chicken seasoning and blackening it instead. I also baked the crust with just the garlic/rosemary butter for 5 minutes before adding the chicken and alfredo so that it wouldn't come out soggy like other reviewers said it might. The crust was still a little soft, next time i'll bake just the crust for a couple minutes more. I also added fresh mushrooms. all in all, really good.

Sorry, we didn't like this at all.  Found it to be very dry and flavorless.  Valentino's Pizza Crust on this site is also much better liked at our house.  Certainly won't make again.

This was a very tasty pizza, but it is very rich. The dough is wonderful, and we use it for all of our pizzas.

This has become a weekly favorite in my house. I even use the sauce separate for pasta and the dough for all our other favorite pizzas.

I thought that this pizza was good.  I did have to bake it for almost double the time indicated.  The crust came out nice, even at high altitude.  I have made this twice, and everyone liked it both times. Next time, I'll add red onions, some roasted red peppers and some   quartered artichoke hearts for a little more excitement.

This was soo good.  My boyfriend and I were very pleased!  I didnt make my own crust to save time i used ready made pilsbury crust in a can and also used a combo mixture of italian cheeses in the alfredo sauce and also put a little cheese on top of everything before baked.  I loved the garlic butter.  It turned out soo yummy!! Will definitely  make this again!
