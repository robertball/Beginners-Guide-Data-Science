This is such an easy recipe and it's excellent!  I changed it per my sister's advice by adding some garlic salt on the chicken and pour the sauce over the chicken from the beginning.  Cook it at 350 for 35 - 40 minutes until chicken is done.  So fabulous!  We are having company tonight and I am making this again.  It's THAT GOOD!!!

Made this tonight for dinner because I wanted to try something sweet and I wasn't disappointed!  I was skeptical about baking the chicken in a foil-lined pan but it was fine; the chicken didn't stick because of the honey mixture creating a bed of juice at the bottom of the pan.  I took the advice of others and seasoned the chicken as well for the first 30 minute baking session.  I used garlic powder, pepper, and creole seasoning. I was also a 1/4 cup short of honey but I think that was for the better, as the chicken was just sweet enough!  I added the honey mixture as soon as it was done, so about the last 15 minutes of the first 30 minute session.  I probably cooked the chicken a few minutes longer than needed because it was a little overbrowned.  But it was still delicious!   This was quick and easy.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was nice and quick (great for a work night) and definitely tasty!  I did scale down the honey a bit (maybe closer to 1/3 c) and decided to add 1 tsp of curry powder after reading some reviews and I thought it turned out quite flavourful.  I also sprinkled the chicken with garlic, pepper and salt while it cooked for the first 30 mins.  It is on the sweeter side, so if that's not your thing, you may not enjoy.  I also basted the chicken several times with the sauce once I added it.  Will make again, thanks!

I love this recipe!  It's so easy and the whole family loves it!  Sometimes I use BBQ sauce instead of mustard and sometimes I just use honey alone.

For the first time in our marriage, my husband actually liked something that I didn't. He ate every bit of his chicken and half of mine. I absolutely love honey but as much as I hate to say it, this was just too much honey -- to the point that it distorted any possible flavors that should have been there. However, I must say that I used boneless breasts and they came out amazingly tender and pretty moist, too! I was very pleased about that aspect. I'm sure I could play around with this a bit and get it closer to my liking; only time will tell.

Since I was spending Thanksgiving alone this year, I decided to use this recipe and bake a large chicken breast, enough for 2 days. I omitted the mustard, used pure Honey Maple syrup, and had to adjust the baking time a little, but it turned out wonderfully! So juicy and tender! I served it with mashed potatoes and brown gravy, fresh corn and snow peas, dressing, hot buttered biscuits, and Blue Cranberry Sauce (from this site, which is also wonderful!) Now, if I get back to where I can button my pants again, I may have a piece of fresh apple pie later:) Happy Thanksgiving!

This was great! Thank you for the recipe! My boyfriend has never given me this kind of reaction to a new recipe. I try new ones all the time...sometime I have something to follow, others I just experiment. He said exactly this.."mmm this is so go I never want it to end." HaHa! I thought it was awesome too. I just wish the glaze was a bit thicker. you could def. use this recipe to glaze at least 5 chicken breasts with the amount that is left over. But if you like white rice I would reccomend simply cooking some rice and pouring the glaze in the rice for a good "healthier" side. I will definitely be cooking this more often.

Amazing!  Simple!  Juicy! I used Grey Poupon Deli Mustard (made with horseradish) which was the right choice over dijon.

Very good recipe!  It was the first home cooked meal that I made myself in my new home.  It tasted really good and I made it over brown rice.  I cut back on the honey per the reviews but I think that caused the sauce to stick less to the meat.  Next time I'm going to use the full amount so the chicken is really nice and covered and the sauce is more thick.  The leftovers were great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Really wonderful flavor! Thanks for posting this. Ended up with more sauce than necessary though. Make sure you use a small pan!

This tasted like something I would get in a really nice restaurant. I salted & peppered the chicken before I baked it, also used Dijon Mustard. Hubby loved it! I made it with the microwave risotto on this site. Did not have wine to add so used same amount of water and added chicken bouillion, turmeric  and some frozen peas. Hubby, who is not a big rice fan, loved it too and said..don't change a thing. Thank you Helen..this is going on my menu for guests.

This was so yummy, and super easy! I seasoned chicken tenders with garlic powder, salt, pepper, herbs de provence, and parsley before baking. While the chicken was baking I made the sauce, and added it about ten minutes into baking. I didn't have quite enough honey for the sauce, but it still turned out great! I did add a little extra mustard because I'm a mustard fan, but I didn't really notice much of a difference. Because I used chicken tenders instead of breasts, they baked in about 30 minutes rather than an hour. Again, soo easy and good!

I made this a couple of nights ago for my beef loving husband and he gave it great reviews.  I used boneless breasts instead of bone in.  I took another reviewers advice and seasoned with garlic powder first.  Its a nice recipe, I will make it again.

Can't taste the mustard at all, but still good. Seasoned chicken with salt pepper garlic first.

Really juicy and delicious!  I followed suggestions to put put salt and garlic on chicken breasts before cooking, then put the sauce on after cooking about 20 minutes.  I also cut the honey a little bit (1/2 cup for 3 chicken breasts).  Very tasty and even the children liked it!

This was so good!  Looking over the different recipes I decided to add 1 tsp curry powder to the sauce.  Tasted sooo amazing and smelled great too!  Chicken was tender and juicy.  Served with baked potatoes and Italian seasoned green beans.  Family will love it!

I used dijon mustard instead of regular yellow mustard, and added just a little bit more. Delicious! Will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious and simple!  I skipped the cooking of the honey sauce and just melted the butter and mixed it all together in a bowl.  I poured it over the chicken and refrigerated until I was ready to throw it in the oven.  I think this does make WAY to much honey sauce though.  I used 3 chk brst halves and it was still a lot!  Good flavor and easy enough ;)

I made this for the first time tonight for me and my husband.  It was so good!  I changed it by adding garlic salt to the chicken before covering it with the honey glaze and served it with rice and salad.  It was a simple but tasty go to meal!  Very pleased :)

Very easy to make. I just poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it at 350 for maybe 45 minutes, and I turned the chicken a couple of times. Very good over rice. My MIL was over for dinner and she loved it! This is one of my new favorites. I was out of regular mustard so I used Dijon and it was fine.

Excellent flavorful chicken. I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken first and then omitted the salt from the sauce. Overall excellent.

This was very good, but we made some adjustments, so I can't give 5 stars.  I used boneless breasts and baked them with the sauce on already.  It was excellent!

very good! Although I made it twice and I thought using boneless chicken breast was much better.

It was incredible! I had to alter the amount of the glaze because of my amount of chicken, and I used breasts & drumsticks. I did not know if the drumsticks would turn out as good, but they did! I highly recommend this recipe. I 5 people and everyone ate it up.

I used boneless chicken breasts and adjusted cooking time accordingly. The sauce had wonderful flavor but was thin. Next time I will cook it longer on the stovetop and see if it will thicken. This was delicious!

i used a bit more mustard and put some of the honey-mustard-butter mixture on the chicken prior to cooking.  i cooked for 30 minutes and then put the rest of the mixture on the chicken and then cooked to 160ºF.  came out tasty and moist!  i may remove the skin next time.

This chicken is SUPER yummy and incredibly easy to make!  We served it up with Thai Jasmine rice and broccoli.  The entire family loved it! (which is very rare with four kids!)  My husband made it for the firehouse two days later, and added some curry.  He said it was a huge hit!

I really LOVED this recipe! My husband and I LOVE chicken, and I'm always looking for a new way to prepare it. We prefer dark meat, so I made this with thighs instead of breasts. Also, my hubby does not like the skin on his chicken, so I took his off and he said the flavor was amazing. Ty for sharing this recipe Helen. It was delicious, and definitely one I will be making again, and again.

My kids loved it.  So did I.  Followed the basic recipe and ended up adding a bit of allspice, salt n pepper rub and glazing first and then adding the sauce half way through baking.  Time was spot on, the chicken was soft and tender and fully cooked.  Threw in some apricots in the sauce and they candied in the sauce and were delicious!  Great recipe for chicken that kids love!

Very good recipe.  My hubby thought it a little too sweet (which is why it is 4 instead of 5 stars).  I would have given it 5 stars because it was very good and super duper easy!  It was very easy and very moist and juicy when done.  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!  I will make it again, but it will not be one of his favorites because of the sweetness.

Very delicious! I made it "as-is" and served with brown rice and steamed asparagus. A spoonful of the sauce drizzled over the serving of rice made it even better. This recipe is a definite keeper, and I can't wait to try different variations (but will definitely make the standard recipe again and again, my family loved it).

This recipe is fantastic on its own, and very easy to manipulate.  The first time I made it, I just followed the base recipe, and served it with corn and roasted Potatoes.  It was satisfying.  The next time I made it I used the suggestions of others, and served it with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies...Again satisfying.  The third time, I reduced the honey a smidgen and Added banana Slices when I poured the sauce, and it tasted fantastic.  I served it with grilled Hawaiian Rolls and a bowl of Sweet Corn Ice Cream.  =)

I seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before baking (I used boneless).  It was so good and very easy. It tasted just fine without the mustard. I sprinkled sesame seeds on top before serving. I regret not making more!

Very easy and very good, a lot of sauce left over but I wouldn't change the recipe, except that I used boneless chicken breasts and they turned out so soft and tender! Just don't overcook or they won't be as soft.

This was so-so. I loved the sauce as I was making it, but it didn't seem enough to cover chicken (I reserved maybe an 1/8th cup to glaze) After I had baked it, I poured "drippings" in saucepan with some roux and made a thicker sauce for them, served with rice. Had an Asian taste, different, not bad, but not my favorite. Thanks anyway!

I made it with spicy brown mustard following a couple of reviewer recommendations: sprinkled salt, garlic, and pepper on the chicken breasts and then poured the sauce mixture on for the entire cooking time.  I baked at 350F for 45 minutes (basting a couple of times), and it was a little overcooked, but otherwise tasty.  Would do again!

I recommend this all the time and realized I never rated it.  It is really good! There are just 2 of us now that our nest is empty, so this recipe as is works well for us.  When I have company I just up the amounts. I have found if I cover the chicken in the pan w/ foil for about the first 20 mins or so, the chicken seems more moist. Don't know why??  I have used reg mustard, dijon mustard and stone ground mustard and they all have a wonderful flavor. I usually up the sauce amounts because we love it. I usually serve w/ rice, so that sauce enhances that, also. With a salad or veg, this is an easy and quick meal and very good!!

I was skeptical but this turned out delicious. I used bonesless skinless chicken breasts and poured the sauce on before I put it in the oven. I cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes and basted after 20 mins  - turned out just right!

I made this a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely delicious!!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts though.  I put the sauce on it right away before I put it in the oven and basted it every 15 minutes until it was done.

i give it 4 stars because i changed it a little, based on others' reviews. i used 1/3 cup honey. i used chicken breast tenderloins. i coated the chicken in some garlic powder, a little pepper, and a dash of creole seasoning before adding sauce mixture. i added the sauce mixture before placing the chicken in the oven and cooked it the full time with the sauce mixture. i liked the idea of the aluminum foil in the bottom and also covered the chicken with aluminum foil on top for the beginning 2/3 of the cooking time.   also, i used boar's head deli style mustard.  i absolutely LOVED this chicken. i could eat it all day. my boyfriend said he liked it and would eat it again, but he wasn't as crazy about it as i was.  does anyone have suggestions for sides to pair with this? i used the sauce from the chicken to top on some baked potatoes, but i feel like using the sauce from this on something else is just too much of the same flavor....what flavor would pair well with this?

Good but not real special.  Added some spices to the first 30 minutes as suggested by others.  I was hoping for a little more crispiness.  And the sauce on bottom of pan was not really flavorful as it was dilluted by the chicken juice.

I just got done making this chicken for me and my daughter.  I just made 2 chicken breasts.  It was awesome.  My daughter asked  me how I made it and when I told her, she couldn't believe how easy it was.  Now she has more confidence to cook.

This recipe is the best baked chicken recipe ever. My family absolutely loved it and so did I. I upped the measurements of the ingredients just alittle. I first used "Chicken Rub" seasoning on my chicken with alittle pepper, season-all salt, and alittle unseasoned meat tenderizer. I olive Oiled the bottom of my baking pan and placed the chicken in with alittle green bell pepper, and onion. For the sauce I used just a tad bit more Curry then needed but not too much. I added my melted butter, Cayenne Pepper, and thyme. I used Spicy brown mustard instead of the dry mustard and poured the mxture over the chicken. I did baste commit to basting it every 15 mins and fliiped them over and over again every now and again. Then once my 75 mins were thru, I made another sauce mixture and poured it on the chicken and baked it uncovered on 400 degrees until golden brown. It was soooooo good that everyone else took over cleaning up the kitchen afterwards!! That's never happened before. I got a shoudler rub too. Kudos to the one who posted this recipe.

This was surprisingly a hit with my kids.  They are very picky about their food, but had no arguments with this dish.  My fiance prefers this to be done with chicken that still has skin.  I agree that it gives it a nice crisp coating.  This was a great alternative to chicken nuggets for my two toddler boys.

I made this for dinner one night for my mother, my husband and myself.. I have to start off by saying that the smell while it was cooking did not smell very good.. Im not sure if I just dont like honey or what but yeah It stinks..

It was extremely easy to make.. I just did not like the taste at all.. My Husband says it was ok, but he was just being nice.. When he doesnt finish his plate, I know he didnt like it.. My Mother said it was ok, and she really liked the sauce on rice.. 

I wont be cooking this again..  I gave the recipe a 3 because it could be that I just dont like honey and didnt know it..  If you think it stinks while you are cooking it, you probably wont like it..

This is 5 stars for ease and for the consistency of the chicken...very moist when finished. I'd say it's more like 4 stars for taste...I'd like to get it to carmelize better and brown up, but it never did. Everyone loved it anyway. GREAT choice for a quick meal!!

This was okay.  My husband liked it, but I thought it was lacking something.  I used yellow mustard, and also used seasoned salt as reccomended by some reviews.  I may play with it using spicer mustard, but first I'll try some other recipes on the site that include more spices.

This recipe was so easy. I used boneless thighs instead of breast and as an after thought, put in a splash of tequila as the sauce cooked. Served it over rice made in chicken broth. Wonderful! I also had Dad's Pan-Fried Green Beans which was also delicious. Definitely will make again.

This was so easy and tasted delicious.  I only recommend it for honey lovers, though.  The hardest part about this recipe was waiting for it to finish cooking while the wonderful sweet smells filled the kitchen!  A keeper for sure!

Every time I make this I adore it. With grey Poupon mustard there is just the right mix of sweet and zingy. I usually make extra sauce to cover rice and veggies too.

Too plain and was way too sweet for the chicken. I would add a little bit of salt to balance it out a little.

Easy and Cheap!  I already had all of the required ingredients, and that's one of my number one priorities when looking through recipes.  I made the "sauce" with and without curry powder (as other reviewers have suggested) and my fiance and I both decided it was too sweet to leave it out.  We both gave this recipe a big thumbs up and it has been moved into the "do again" section of my recipe book.  Yum!

I did not enjoy this at all. For some reason the mustard would not break down in the honey and butter, even after heating it up. Not sure what I did wrong. It tasted like honey poured over chicken. Will not use again, sorry.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I didnt think I was gonna like it at first because it really smelled like mustard and I dont like mustard but it turned out really good, you couldnt taste the musdard at all.  I cooked the chicken for 20 minutes and then added the honey mixture and cooked for like another 45 minutes.  I will make this aagin.

I love the honey glaze for this chicken! It's excellent. The only issue I had was that I used skinless/boneless breast (not crazy about bone chicken) so I wasn't quite sure how long to cook it for and had more sauce than I needed. But great recipe!

I often cook for over a dozen people and this makes the main entree simple!  And if you make extra dressing, you can heat it up and serve it again without anyone knowing you are serving leftovers!

Super simple and kids love it! I have made this several times and even my chicken hating husband loves it. It has just enough flavor for adults and kids like the sweet saucey taste. I add sliced almonds to give it a bit of crunch and serve with egg noodles. Great quick meal when you use chicken breasts instead of bone in. Just cook at 350 for 20-30 min. with the honey mustard from the start.
Thanks!

Was looking for a different way to make chicken. Tried this recipe with the following changes - I used 4 chicken tenders & swapped out the mustard for a small quantity of lemon juice & some ground ginger. I too used some garlic salt, a little chicken & seafood seasoning to the chicken while it first was baking before the sauce was added. My hubby & I liked the honey flavor and will likely try this recipe again with the same modifications. Enjoy!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  It was good but I probably won't make it again.

I made this for the first time tonight - I was searching for something easy and I don't have many ingredients on hand in my apartment.  I used some spicy mustard, garlic sea salt, and ground pepper in addition to the butter and honey. I also used boneless chicken.  I let the chicken cook for only about 15 minutes before adding the glaze... It does end up being a little too much honey - I didn't use it all and saved it freshen up my leftover piece tomorrow.   Overall I thought it was a good meal... not necessarily something I would cook for guests, but it was something easy I could put in the oven and study while it cooked.  It sure beats frozen pizza!

So simple and so gooood!  I used 4 boneless chicken breasts and seasoned them with Paula Dean's house seasoning (which is salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder) and browned them quickly in olive oil.  I also increased the mustard to 1/4 cup and used spicy mustard.  I combined the sauce ingredients in a pot and then poured it over the chicken breasts and only cooked for 25 min @ 350.  So tender and great flavor!

cooked the recipe as it is described chicken is moist however we like thicker sauces with our chicken and this was a little thin to our liking.  The taste is good like a honey mustard with the mustard being dominant with what little is in the recipe.    Will make again but possibly tweak it a bit and make it on the stove top vs oven and coat the chicken with flour prior to the cooking

Well one person was right when they said it smelled bad when it was baking. If I wasn't basting it constantly the sauce burned and filled the kitchen with smoke. I had too much of a hassle with this so never again, sorry.

This was REALLY good! I sprinkled my chicken with some fresh garlic powder from my healthfood store. You should try it sometime, it's NO comparaison to store bought garlic powder. I also added a little extra honey. I hadsome eft over baked potato's in the fridge and when this was lamost done cooking i chopped them up and threw them in to heat. This is a keeeper for sure! I loved it, thank you!

Pretty good! I did use less butter than the reciple called for, and I also added some sesame seeds.I used boneless chicken breasts so altered the cooking time for that. The sauce was great for the baked chicken, and for dipping the veg!

With a little tweaking, this was a great recipe. I did add some fresh garlic as some other reviewers suggested.I also used spicy brown mustard, and added a little extra to taste than what the recipe called for. I also think the cooking time was a bit too long. I cooked mine at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes and it came out great! I will def make again though.

This was very tasty chicken!!  The honey flavor was amazing.  The only thing I changed was using boneless chicken which I seasoned and I added a little honey BBQ to the sauce.  I cooked it for about 45 minutes total.

really good.  I pounded my chicken out thin and cooked the chicken without the sauce for the first half of the cooking time, and added the sauce and baked it for the second half.  Everyone loved it.
