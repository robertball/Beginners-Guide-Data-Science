This was DE-licious! Easy, followed the recipe exactly as it said and it was wonderful! I made it with cheese/jalepeno cornbread and my husband who is a picky eater loved it! And so did I! This is more like a chili than a stew and put my chili to almost shame, but not quite... good stuff will definitely make again.

This turned out pretty good. I do think I used the wrong soup though. The recipe did not specify and I just assumed the condensed version. I had to add water to get it soup consistency. Now that I think about it, the recipe submitter probably meant the other famous brand that is not condensed. Either way this was good. I did think the veggie ratio was off for 2 pounds of ground beef. I ended up throwing in a handful of frozen green beans and peas.  I would definitely make this again. It is super simple.

Simple and quick. Spicy, but that's easy enough to adjust by using regular pinto beans or diced tomatoes with no chilis.
