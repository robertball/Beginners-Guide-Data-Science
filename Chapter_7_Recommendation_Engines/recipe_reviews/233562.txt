Well... this was pretty ho-hum so I added another half t basil &... well still not too impressed. It was edible but won't be a repeat. I made the mistake of not taking out the bay leaf in the leftovers. That didn't help either but my review is on first night taste which was "ok". A little red pepper helps most dishes. I'm not going to play with this one though.
