Fabulous!  I used a full cup of dried cranberries and Splenda instead of sugar.  Hubby wolfed it down.  I might try making bread pudding or french toast out of this...

I made this bread for breakfast this morning, using the timer mode.  It came out perfect and tasted sweet in spite of the small amount of sugar.  Since I was using the timer, I wasn't sure what to do with the cranberries.  So I mixed them with the dry ingredients.  It worked.  Next time I,m going to try using 1 cup of cranberries.  I used the sweet bread, light cycle.

I just bought my bread machine so I'm only a beginner but this recipe was so easy to make and turned out great.  I didn't have any cranraisins so I substituted chopped, dried sour cherries.  Delicious!!

Great bread!  I did make a few changes because my family likes sweet stuff.  I added a TBSP of white sugar because I used Sunsweet Cranberries which aren't as sweet as the others and I added 3/4 Cup of the cranberries and my family already asked that I try a whole cup next time.  Even without my changes it was still good.  Be sure to set for a light crust!

Oh YUM! I made this two days ago, and I'm making it again as soon as possible! Couldn't be easier...or more tasty! Will maybe try light crust next time- Medium was not bad, just a little chewy.

What a wonderful bread!  A nice change from cinnamon raisin which is a breakfast standby at our house.  I even make this one to take as a gift when I go visiting.

I love this recipe. I made a couple of changes. Instead of 3/4 cup of water, I put 1/2 cup of water with 1/4 cup applesauce and warmed that up together, 3 tea cinnamon, and 1 3/4 tea quick rise yeast. I really like cranraisin, so I added 3/4 cup. set on regular bread cycle on light crust and a 1 1/2 lb loaf. This turned out so moist and the flavor is wonderful. I know this will be a favorite.

This is the best bread I've ever made in the bread machine. Definitely use a full cup of dried cranberries; I used cranberries and raisins. I also used two heaping tablespoons of sugar and added a little maple syrup. I didn't have any dry milk powder, so I just substituted milk for the water. Next time I'll increase the cinnamon and try adding more syrup. I used the sweet bread and light crust settings. Makes excellent toast. Slice and freeze after the bread has cooled to preserve freshness.

I made this bread with the delay timer so it would be ready in the morning. It was on medium crust and large loaf.  It came out burnt (b/c of the honey?)  I'll try this again on light crust and medium size loaf next time and see it it helps.

I used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 2 tsps. & a heaping 1/2 cup of sweetened dried cranberries, PLUS 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans.
This bread makes excellent French Toast!
It was even good with peanut butter and jelly.
I'll definitely make it again.
This one's a winner!

Great just the way it is!  Not too sweet, not too plain.  But next time I make it I will double the cinnamon since I love it so much and I would also double the craisins.

Absolutely brilliant and very easy to make!  Because this is Australia I had to substitute Baker's flour and bread improver to the recipe but it didn't change it at all.  Absolutely yummy toasted with spread!

I made this bread exactly like the directions, then I sliced HUGE slices. Made a cut in the middle and stuffed it with cooked bacon (crumbled) and turned it into stuffed french toast. Talk about to die for! Needless to say it was a hit and my family can't stop talking about it. Thank you!

This recipe frustrated me!  The FIRST time I made this, I followed other reviewers suggestions to increase the sugar by 1 T. and cranraisins to 1 c., and because it sounded good, I added some walnuts...the bread didn't rise so I figured it must be my fault.  I tested my brand new yeast to make sure it was active and made this again.  The SECOND time I used the ingredients exactly in the amounts as written and prepared this in the bread maker on the dough setting.  I rolled it out and let it rise the second time in a regular loaf pan before baking in the oven.  For the second rise I kept adding hours on to the rise time, eventually letting it rise about 4.5 hours, and it still hadn't quite doubled in volume. The texture of the bread is dense and really it just wasn't worth all the work.

The whole family love this recipe. Though I did change 3 things after reading all the reviews. I added  1/4 sugar instead of 2 Tblsps, added 2 heaping Tblsps of cinnamon and last I also added 1 cup cranraisins instead of the 1/2. I will be making this again and again.

This bread is really good but it needed more cinnamon and more sugar. It was rather bland. I tried it a second time with more cinnamon and sugar and wit was wonderful.

Very,very good bread recipe!  I processed
the whole thing in the bread machine on dough and then baked it in a loaf pan.  Served it this morning at to guests and everyone loved it, plain and toasted.  Then I served turkey and cheese on it for lunch for my husband and son...they loved it!  A recipe I will surely use again!  Thank you.

I made this bread about 2 days ago.. It's SO fantastic! I used about 2 times as much craisins, used whole wheat flour, added some extra vanilla and substituted sugar with niets by natrena, sweetener that has 0 calories, and it all worked out fine!

I can't get enough of it, everybody loves it and the smell is just terrific!

Wonderful recipe.  Taking other reviewers suggestions, I used a cup of craising, increased the sugar to a quarter cup (would have used Splenda but ran out), subbed one cup of white for wheat flour (personal preference) and used the light cycle.  One note:  I love waking up to the scent of fresh baked bread but any recipe containing eggs is not a candidate.  Eggs need to be refrigerated until used!  Okay, call me a party-pooper.  Thanks everyone, this one is a keeper!

This bread is delicious! I increased the sugar and craisins like a previous reviewer suggested and it was just perfect. I also used the light crust setting. This is a *wonderful* recipe that I will make over and over.

Awesome, awesome good. Loved all the flavors; pillowy soft, delicious! I don't have a bread machine...which worked swell in my favor: instead of just mixing in the craisins, I took the opportunity to create a beautiful swirl by rolling the dough out after the first rise, then sprinkling with brown sugar, cinnamon, and craisins...rolled up and sealed. Since I doubled the recipe, I did the swirl to the 2nd loaf but left out the craisins and added some butter with the sugar and cinnamon... InSaNe good. They baked perfectly in 35 minutes. I DO have to clean my oven now, as the swirl oozed a bit and made a mess, but it was worth it :)

This was gone in 1 day. Very flavorful bread. I used 1 c of wheat flour instead of 1 c of all purpose. I also added 4 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. I used a mix of cranberries, cherries, raisins, and blueberries. I am making this again tonight!

I made this bread without the craisins.  The texture was excellent and it baked beautifully.  It needed more sweetness.  I used honey instead of sugar and I don't think I put in enough.  The bread made great French Toast.  I will definitely make again but I might try brown sugar next time to improve the sweetness.

The only change I made was to omit the cranberries and add 1 Tblspn of ground cinnamon.  I used this bread to make french toast the next day...next time I will select the light crust, instead of medium, on the bread machine as it made it a little too crusty.  I'm sure it would be good with the cranberries but didn't want that for french toast.  Will make again.

Wow! I wish I had yeast to make it this morning! It's a delicious breakfast/brunch loaf. Next time I will proof the yeast because it didn't rise the second time I made it. Easy too. Thanks for posting Tammy!

Excellent!  Made this with Multi-Grain flour and added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar to the Splenda I used based on other comments. Not too sweet, a bit saltly and makes the house smell wonderful!

I made this bread without a bread machine and my family loved it! The whole loaf was gone in about an hour! The only change I made was to substitute 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour instead of more white flour. I also made this with bread flour instead of AP. The only problem I had with it is that I felt it to be a little salty...other than that, this is an excellent bread that I would make again! Thanks for sharing!

This bread is awesome.  My family went crazy over this.  Am having trouble keeping enough done to go around.  Even though I have bread flour on hand this was nice to be able to just use all purpose flour.

Good bread. Followed recipe exactly & it turned out perfectly. The whole house smelled good. Next time I will add a little more sugar, though, to make the bread sweeter & some freshly grated orange rind & maybe some nuts. Would be great for making French toast.

made this bread with questionably old dried milk and 1 cup raisins instead of cranraisins and it turned out PERFECTLY! So easy, so delicious! 
I wasn't sure if my machine would tell me when to add the raisins so I added them during the second kneading cycle (just lifted the lid and poured them in) and they mixed in great by the end of the cycle.

I have made several times. I normally dont like raisin bread. I just dont like chewy stuff in my bread. But this is wonderful. I have used cranraisins and dried cranberries. I use by bread machine and add the cranberries when it beeps. I make this regularly. Definately one of my favorites.

This bread turned out great.  I made one small adjustment because we like things a bit sweeter so I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the original recipe.  The house smelled amazing while this was cooking.  My husband loved it and asked me to make more right away.  Definitely going to be a family favorite.

this recipe is almost flawless.  I did have  to add a bit more flour to make it less sticky-maybe 1/4 cup.  I use part whole wheat and part bread flour.  I also pureed the raisins before hand so my 4 yr old would still get the fiber without noticing any raisins.  My loaf came out beautiful and I always brush mine with melted butter after removing from the pan to keep the crust soft and add sheen.

Great recipe. I saw my mother (who normally hates bread) sneak a few pieces of this.  I did up the cranberries to 1 cup and added 2 tablestppns of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar.  The bread itself is a good base for sweetbread that you can add your own favorite ingredients to like rasins shredded coconut nuts etc.   This recipe is excellent and I will experiment with other additions next time.

After making this bread twice I don't think I will make it again.  I really like the flavor, but both times it came out very very dry.  It was best eaten right out of the oven.  I would love this bread if only it was more moist.

I love craisins so I had to try this out.   It was super easy, it rose nice and high, but best of all the taste was out of this world.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and doubled the craisins.   I will make this often.

I made the recipe as is except I added 1 cup of cranberries and I found out when I was done I had forgotten to add the fat. We didn't miss it and overall it was a great bread. I never had much luck with the bread machine, and think this will even improve when making it by hand. The recipe is good enough to give that another try!

Made this for a Father's Day gift for my honey and he loved it! I didn't taste any as I don't care for cranberries. His only complaint was that it could have been a bit sweeter.

This was great!! I doubled the amount of cranberries, and it was yummy!

Next time, I am going to try adding some whole wheat flour to make it a little heartier and healthier, but following the recipe here it's still wonderful. 

I set the bread machine to have it ready in the morning, and loved waking up to the smell of baking bread!!!

The bread was very good, but the top looked pretty dry. It could have been that it calls for all-purpose flour. I was wondering, Can I use bread flour for this? I would love to try it again. Thanks:-)

This recipe made the best Cinnamon  RAISIN bread that I have ever made. I used the dough setting on the bread machine, kneaded a bit on a floured surface when done, placed the loaf in a greased and floured glass bread pan and baked at 350* for 40-45 min. I made a couple of changes suggested by viewers. I used 1/2 cup warm water with 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the 3/4 cup of water. I also used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and threw in some finely chopped walnuts. I have learned to sprinkle a little sugar around the loaf pan to deep it from sticking and it adds a bit of just the right amount of sweetness. I did make changes but it is such a great basic recipe that can be changed a bit for variety. Really good bread.
 05/2018: Tried the recipe again using dough cycle of bread machine and it was great! I increased the measurements by 1/2 and shaped into 2 loaves when done,covered and let rise 40 min, baked at 350* for 45 min. Next time will bake 40 min because the loaves are smaller than one loaf.

I didn't have dry milk powder so I substituted coconut flakes and while I was at it I used palm coconut sugar too. I cooked it on light and the texture was just right. Excelent sweet machine bread.

Followed exactly in my bread machine.  Used mixed dried berries instead of just cranberries.  Turned into a hard lump of something in the corner of the machine.  Brand new yeast, new bag of berries.  What a waste.

This recipe is yummy!  I did make some changes, and I can't imagine it tasting as good if I wouldn't have made them.  I didn't have any powdered milk, and since other reviewers mentioned it being dry, I used 3 Tbsp. of milk from the fridge in place of the powdered.  I also omitted the 2 Tbsp. of white sugar and used 4 Tbsp. of brown sugar instead.  I used real butter instead of margarine (I only use real butter when baking), added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and instead of all-purpose flour, I used 1 c. of whole wheat flour and 1 2/3c. bread flour.  Oh, and like most others I upped the amount of dried cranberries to 1 full cup and added them with the dry ingredients at the beginning! :)

So yummy!  I made this today and love it.  This is only my 4th loaf ever but it turned out perfectly.  The only changes I made were:  upped the sugar to 1/4 cup and added about a cup of cranberries.  Delicious.  My  kids love it too.  My 5yo keeps saying "Mmm this bread is goooood!"

Based on the reviews, I also used 1/4 cup white sugar and used a full cup of cranberries. I added the cranberries in with the rest of the dry ingredients at the beginning. I baked this in a breadmaker on the sweet cycle, light crust. Smelled fantastic and tasted delicious! Next time I may add more cinnamon and maybe some brown sugar.

Absolutely delicous!  I followed a few of the suggestions in the comments (soaking the craisins in OJ, adding a bit extra flour and some brown sugar).  It turned out fantastic.  I will be definitely making this again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Fantastic! As the other reviewers suggested, I added 2 heaping Tbsp of sugar and a little bit of maple syrup. I also used 2/3 of a cup of whole wheat flour. I added the raisins (I didn't have craisins) in with all the other ingredients in the beginning and it turned out fine.

Suggestion: don't take the bread immediately out of the bread maker when the time is up. My bread came out slightly uncooked, but I returned it to the bread maker to sit in the heat for a few hours, and it finished cooking. The result was a slightly sticky, moist, delicious bread.

This was good, but was extremely dense. It tasted even better when toasted, but didn't fit all the way down inside my toaster. I had to flip it over to toast it completely. I did double the cranberries as another reviewer suggested.

this bread is delicious!  But for some reason....my cranraisins weren't mixed in just all at the bottom and sporadic ones inside the bread.  Maybe it was my bread machine I guess?  I think next time I'll try mixing them in with the dry ingredients.

YUMMY bread.  Made a nice loaf of bread and rose perfectly.  I did use two cups of bread flour and one cup of wheat and used one cup of craisins.  Made the kitchen smell wonderful during rising and baking!  Thanks tammi.

This turned out great.  I used 1 cup of dried cranberries instead of 1/2 cup.  It is great toasted!

My machine did not mix well and all the berries ended up on the bottom. Flavor of the bread could use a kick but the smell was wonderfull. I will try again the old fashioned way using more spice and 1 cup berries.

Delicious! I followed this recipe exactly and the bread came out great. I wasn't paying attention to the different rising times, so I may have put the cranberries in during the wrong mixing time, but it still tasted wonderful.

This was a good recipe.  The bread had a nice texture...firm, but not too dense.  And the craisins are a nice change from the ordinary (surprisingly, they weren't tart at all).  I would definitely make this recipe again.

I baked this on the light sweet bread setting and it came out great. It was a little dry by the next day so I think next time I will slice and freeze what's left as soon as it cools. Since it wasn't too soft I was able to slice it into very thin slices. It makes very good toast.

I substituted one cup of wheat flour and added more craisins. I just dumped them on top of the other ingredients and it worked fine. I used the dough setting and put it in a breadpan, let it rise and baked it. This turned out great!

Nice bread with a light cinnamon taste. I didn't have sweetened dried cranberries, so I just added dried cranberries, and it was perfect. Will surely make again, without any change.

I thought it was too thick and a little dry.  My husband liked it though.
