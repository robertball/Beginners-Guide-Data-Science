I tried out three dip recipes from this website at the same time to compare them and this was the best - at least as a dip for raw vegetables, which is what I wanted.  It has a nice, creamy texture perfect for dipping and a great taste.

I made this early this morning so it would have time to sit and combine flavors before dinner. I used both reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I thought this was quite good, the longer it sits, the better it gets. Next time, I might use a little more garlic and maybe some chopped fresh chives but it's quite good. Even my family liked this one!

I used fat free cream cheese and low fat sour cream and this was soooo good! It was a big hit at a party and no one would ever guess I cut corners on the fat content. I served it with carrots, crackers and even a fresh baked baguette. It went well with everything!!!

Exactly what I wanted.  The store here never has anything but ranch dip which I can't stand.  I used fat free sour cream and it came out great, I didn't even have to add any milk.  I didn't have any green onions so I added a little granulated onion and some extra dill.  Make sure your cream cheese is soft enough before you mix it or else you'll be mixing forever to get the lumps out.

I really liked this dip, even though my husband said it was lacking something. I ended up putting WAY more dill and g. onions than called for. I also added garlic powder rather than minced.  It satisified my pregnancy craving, so I'll make this again!!

This was very easy in a mini food processor. I used an entire blister pack of "baby" dill, and it was still not enough for me. I used one and a half cloves garlic, and it was a bit much for others but perfect for my taste. I did not have to use milk, it was a nice thick dip for veggies :)

Super thick!  I used dried dill and found that I could have used a little more than the recipe calls for, it tasted more like garlic than dill.

This was a good dill recipe.  I need much more than 2 T of milk to get the consistency I wanted.  I served it with carrot sticks and hawaiian bread.

This is a dip that will make me more inclined to reach for raw vegetables. (Unlike Hubs, I really don’t do “cold and crunchy” too well)  I substituted a little garlic powder for the raw garlic, gave it a couple of grinds of pepper, skipped the milk and added a dab of mayonnaise for tang and to make the flavors come alive. I made this yesterday and while it was good, it was infinitely improved today after the flavors had a chance to develop. Four stars rather than five only because it really needed that small amount of mayo to wake it up.

Very nice!! I used a sweet yellow onion because it's what I had on hand. It was quite thick even after adding a couple tablespoons of milk. That fine. I prefer it to be on the thick side. Great for crackers, too. Thanks for this recipe.

I found it hard to get creamy, but my mixer is on the blink, so I think that was my fault!  Otherwise, a very nice mild flavour.

For an alternative, I made a second batch with chives instead of dill and extrad onions -- also awesome!!

Yum! Easy to make and really tasty. I agree with some other reviewers that it wasn't all that dill-y, it tasted more like an onion and garlic dip to me, but I'm not a huge dill fan so the faint taste of it was fine with me. Don't count on this making 16 servings, unless it's going on a buffet table with a lot of other dips or appetizers. Maybe that's the serving size you *should* have, but really.. who is going to eat just 2 tbsp of dip if you're sitting down to watch a movie with some chips and dip? I used low fat cream cheese and while it tastes fine, I find that the low fat cream cheese doesn't blend as smoothly. Not a big deal, but if you care about that, go for full fat.

Tasted only the cream cheese. This would have been better with only the sour cream.

I had never made a dip before, and I was selected to bring one for a potluck...everyone loved the taste, and it is so easy to make, that I make it all the time...no one else mentioned using it for chips, but it's great with salty salsa-type chips (as long as you don't add much milk).

I made this for a Father's Day cookout.  It went so quick that I had to run to the store to buy more ingredients to make another batch!  It is a very easy recipe to follow.

I had a hard time getting the cream cheese to be less chunky, but even so, the dip was still good and was well received at a party.  Easy to throw together and tastier than store bought veggie dip.

This dill dip had a great flavor.   I added a dash of worsterhire sauce just because I like worstershire in almost everything. I didn't have cream cheese and used only sour cream and I think it would have turned out much better if I had followed the recipe in that aspect.  I will definitly make it again...only next time I will include the cream cheese.

a very easy and versatile dip. My husband enjoyed it on veggies, chips and baked potato. You do need to add more dill though. I think I'll try plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream next time and a smidge less cream cheese since greek yogurt is thicker. It will be healthier that way an probably equally delicious.

I made this dip a little differently because I didn't have any cream cheese so I did equal parts mayo and sour cream and added a lot more dill than the recipient called for, and it was absolutely delicious!! I can't stop eating it and it was a huge hit at my party. Would make this time and time again and I added this right to my recipient book!

Excellent, made as instructed with the garlic but without the milk and it was great.  It was even better the next day so if you have the time I would make this the day before you intend to serve it.

I make this dip a couple times of year,  For all the reviewers saying they taste only the Cream cheese,   the trick is to make this up at least 24 hours before you want it.   Right after you make it the dill is not very strong,  it really needs to rest for a day in the fridge,    After that, it is very flavorful.

This is a very good dip-- better than anything I have ever bought. I have made it twice in the past week, both times with neufchatel cheese (less fat than cream cheese) and once with fat-free sour cream; I added 2x or 3x the amount of garlic, onion and dill called for since my taste runs that way. (I suspect that it would not taste as good with flakes or powders rather than fresh ingredients.) The only problem with this dip is that I could easily eat the whole bowl in one sitting!

I made this for a small group of friends and they loved it.  One person was happy it did not have blue cheese and another liked that it did not have mayo.  Making it for the second time but am going to half it as I had quite a lot left over and it is too tempting to put on sandwiches, baked potatoes etc.

5 Stars, but plan ahead and make it one day before you serve it.  I chopped the dill finely and tried it after 4 hours - and I rate it at 5 stars. It was good, but my husband wanted more dill flavor, so I added the same amount again.  I substituted chives for the green onions.

Love this recipe.  First I made, I followed the recipe.  Second time, I added more dill and used dill pickle juice instead milk to thin it and add some "tang".

Phenomenal! I served this with sliced french bread and everyone at Thanksgiving raved about it. Make this at least two days if not the day before serving because the flavor gets better and better the longer it sits in the fridge.

I did add a touch of mayo for tang recommended by another reviewer and lemon juice instead of milk to thin it out a bit while mixing.

This was the perfect thick & creamy dip for some homemade, super crunchy seed crackers I made.  I did use A LOT more fresh dill than it called for, and I'm glad I did.  I think it would have lacked a little without it.

I just finished making this recipe.. and Oh my gosh!!! This dip is like crack to me.. I even licked the bowl! I used no fat sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese. I used a little over 2 tsps of dill weed and green onion. It's incredibly flavourful. I'm going to have trouble staying out of this one enough to have some left for my book club tomorrow night.

This dip is incredible! I left the green onions out as I was making it to spread on a baguette to go with salad and didn't want chunks of onion on my bread. And I used just a dash of garlic powder. Definitely let it sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight before serving to allow the dill flavor to infuse the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  I didn't need the milk to thin it out, it had a good consistency that was nice for spreading on bread and for dipping veggies. This one is a keeper!

Loved this dip!  We did add a little extra green onion but other than that followed exact.   Thanks for the recipe.

This was good just not great. A little thick. Every time I went to eat some I had to add milk.
