This salad is DIVINE!  Caprese salad has always been my favorite salad, but the addition of creamy avocado slices, puts this over the moon.  The recipe does not call for basil, but I still like to add some basil strips to my salad.  Also, to make this worth it, invest in quality ingredients-you won't be sorry.

I regularly make this for lunch as it is very quick and easy.  I like to serve it with fresh basil leaves on top.

Very nice salad served as a starter on a hot summer's day.  I used a tomato straight from the garden that was so flavorful and juicy it tasted like a little bit of summer sunshine.  Using the avocado was a nice alternative and a welcome change to a traditional Caprese salad. The only difference is I used a balsamic vinegar that I had reduced down to a syrup consistency.  Very nice change of pace devilsdancefloor.  Thank you for the submission.

We LOVED this, it is super delicious! I am a big fan of Caprese salads, so I was a bit skeptical using the avocado instead of basil. This is fabulous, we had a platter of this as an appetizer yesterday and I'm making more today. I had to use small Campari tomatoes because large tomatoes around here this time of year are not very good. I recommend not adding basil to this because its going to kill the flavor of the avocado. I did see some members did this after reading reviews, I would not like this with basil added also. Be sure to use the salt and pepper too, this recipe is perfect as is! I can't wait to make this with summer tomatoes, thanks for sharing this. I will make this often :)

This was a yummy salad, although the avocado, which I love, was kind of lost.  Its delicate flavor was overwhelmed by the stronger tastes of the vinegar, tomato, and mozzarella.  Also, if you're going to make this, you really can't skimp...you have to use high quality ingredients.  As a result, this is a surprisingly expensive dish.  This is very filling.  My husband and I had it for dinner and it was more than enough to fill us.  This would probably be fine to make 6 appetizers (one "stack" per person).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was quite yummy, but the avocados were out-of-place. I love avocados and will happily eat them any way they come. However, it is a shame to mar the brilliance of the fresh mozzarella and tomato- which is perfection on its own.

This is a nice, cool, summer appetizer.  It's very pretty too.  I chopped up some red onion and sprinkled it over the plate and added a couple chopped olives.  Yum.

Made this along with several other appy's from this site last night. It's was a pleasant change from our usual version. Added cracked black pepper on top & fresh basil. Then drizzled it with delicious quality balsamic vinegar and cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. Yummy :) will be having this combo again soon!

So delicious.  I added some fresh squeezed lime juice to the avocados because I was nervous they would brown before I served the dish. That, paired with balsamic was really nice. This was devoured.

I put a basil leaf on top of each one and drizzled lemon-infused oil over the top to give it a bit of a zest.  So lovely and refreshing.  A very nice way to start a meal.

Delicious.  I only had feta cheese, so used that and it tasted good, but would like to make it again with the mozzarella.

Perfect summer lunch! I like the addition of avocado to the traditional caprese salad. Used basil and parmesan cheese for garnish.

My wife and I enjoyed this salad variation. I made a vegan version using Daiya mozzarella  I put a little bit of fresh basil on top, only because I had some I had to use up. All in all, a nice combination!

Insalata caprese is one of my favorites so I was intriqued by the idea of adding avocado. First, the presentation was beautiful and it was easy to prepare. That said, I agree with the other reviewer that the avocado "got lost" with the other flavors.

I used vine-ripened tomatoes as they have more flavor, and also garlic-infused olive oil. Absolutely delicious. Thanks!

Absolutely love this salad. Make it or order it when eating out as much as I can - big fan of avocado. A nice twist is to leave out the balsamic vinegar and just add lime or lemon juice and a quality chile oil instead - just as yummy. Serve with fresh parsley or on a bed of rocket. - Lexi

Loved it! While I agree the avocado flavor did get a little bit lost, I did very much enjoy the creaminess of it.
