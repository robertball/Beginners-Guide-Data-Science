**** CHIPOTLE SAUCE ****** - Look in your grocer section where the taco sauces are. I found an 8oz. bottle of Chipotle Sauce there made by Ortega. Same bottle style and look as taco sauce but labled as Chipotle Sauce.
I cooked the meat with the stated 1/4c.
of Chipotle Sauce. I also added a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning. This stuff is great, pure flavor because it is not salt based. Once the meat was done, I put the gravy in the frig so the fat/grease would rise to the top and congeal...then removed the fat/grease. Poured the defatted gravy over the shredded meat and added the remainder of the 8 oz. bottle of Chipotle Sauce and a sprinkling more of the Mrs. Dash S-West Chiptotle seasoning. The end result tasted just like Chipotle's shredded meat - fantastic ! It had tons of flavor contrary to the complaints of other reviewers. I also salted the rice after it was done cooking. Additional suggestions for serving this: serve with black beans and corn.

This recipe was awesome!  I chopped up 1 small onion and minced a couple of cloves of garlic and added it to the crock pot.  Also, instead of the water, I used a bottle of Corona beer and squeezed 1/4 of a lime on top of the pork in the crock pot.  I simmered the meat for about 4 hours on low.  I served the meat with tacos, it came out AMAZING!  I will be using this recipe again and again.

Made this recipe for my Cinco de Mayo party. It was a huge hit with everyone,even my siste-in-law who is Mexican - she suggested that I add a little cumin after I shredded the pork and put it back in the crock pot, which I did (approx. 1 1/2 tsp) It added more taste.  This recipe is extremely easy and delicous.  A keeper for sure.

Very rarely - if ever - do I find myself wishing I could rate something more than 5 stars. This, however, is it!! I didn't bother with the rice, but instead added the lime juice (1 lime) and cilantro in with the chipotle sauce (I found it in the Mexican section at Meijer). I marinaded it over night, then cooked for 6 hrs on low. I added a little more chipotle sauce for a little more flavor. We had it with warm flour tortillas, guacamole, grated Cheddar, and plain white rice. Absolutely AWESOME! I would not hesitate in making this again. Thanks, Tora. V!

Answering British contributor nelepope's questions, cilantro is the Spanish name for fresh coriander leaves.  It's found in the produce sections of most U.S. supermarkets.  Google "Mexican grocery UK" and you will find websites that sell chipotle sauce, or you can look up a Chipotle Sauce recipe right here on allrecipes.com.  Chipotle is a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper - look up wikipedia.com for excellent photos and descriptions.  The smokiness adds an awesome flavor dimension!  For both the cilantro and sauce, I would start with half the recipe amount and add more until you find the flavor profile you like.

Both the amazing taste (surprising considering it comes from so few ingredients) and the ease of the recipe earns it a five star rating from me. To give it more flavor since the people in my family like spice: double the chipolte sauce and add another can of chilies. Also: add some lime juice in with the rest of the ingredients. And if you do not want to mess with the rice: throw chopped cilantro (the more the better I think) into the pork when you shred it, then let it sit the fifteen minutes or longer afterwards. I think this recipe cannot sit in the slow cooker too long, so do not worry about that. Thanks for the fabulous addition to my recipe box! Actually making it for dinner again tonight!

This was really good after I followed the recipe as it was written. I tried to make it without the Chipolte Sauce and found it was tasteless.  (Made a special trip to the store and added it in at the end of the cooking time - is this why so many neg reviews? No Chipoltle sauce?). I also added the Cilantro and lime juice after the rice was cooked. Served the pork on top of the rice and layered homemade salsa, guac, cheese and sour cream on top. Put the bottle of Chipoltle sauce on the table for those who like it a little hotter. Definately *****

This was DELICIOUS!  It was a big hit in my apartment.  Based on some of the other reviews and my personal taste, I added:  1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. southwest seasoning, 1 extra can green chiles, and an entire cup of chipotle sauce.

It still wasn't too spicy for some of my friends who are sensitive to that - so if I had it to do over again, I would probably throw in some jalapenos to make it spicier! :-)

Very, very good!  This is a keeper!  I stuck to the recipe as much as possible.  I only had 1/2 of the pork needed, but used the same amount of other ingredients and it turned out great!  Served it over the rice along with fried flour tortilla strips.  While it was cooking, I thought it might be a little too spicy for my 4 year old, but after trying it, she loved it.  My husband ate way too much!  It is in my recipe box!  Thanks for a good one!

YUM!!!  I stuck to the recipe best as I know how ;)  I only used 1.5 LB of pork and squeeze a bit of lime in at the end of the cooking. I found Chipotle Sauce by La Preferedia for $1.69 in a glass bottle, so I'm able to save it instead of wasting an entire can of chipotle peppers. I only used 1 TB of the sauce (feeding it to a 2 yr old).  Will make again!

I was quite disappointed given some of the great reviews here. I followed the recipe exactly and even threw in some chopped onion and southwest chipotle seasoning for extra flavor. We had it in tacos with tomato cilantro and cheese garnish. It was extremely bland and lacking flavor. I was surprised even after using the entire bottle of chipotle sauce. I won't make this again.

I discovered this recipe last week and I have made it twice since last week. For two people. That's a lot of pork per person. SO GOOD.  

I do a couple of little personal twists to this recipe. I have to buy the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and then use the food processor on them, because I cannot find the "chipotle sauce". S'OK, I love that flavor any old how. 

When the pork is done cooking, I strain the fatty sauce goodness that accumulated in the slow cooker. I add lime juice to it, and then I pour about half of my newly made sauce over the pork. 

It absolutely does taste better the next day. If you have the will power to do so, shred it, leave it alone, then re-visit it tomorrow. 

When tomorrow comes, take it out of the fridge and fry it up in butter to get that carnitas-y crispy goodness. 

I love this stuff. I posted three pictures of it on here already, ha!

As written it's probably okay.  I couldn't find chipotlé sauce so I did as others and puréed up some chipotlés in adobo.  I added one medium minced white onion, 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin, juice of one lime and 1/2 cup chicken stock.  As others suggested I added cilantro 1/2 hour before the end.  It reminded me of Chilé Verdé.  Very tasty in soft tacos.  Ate with some Pozolé, Mexican rice and refried beans.

OK, I'm clearly in the minority here.  I'm a texan (yes, small t) and have eaten a rich variety of both Tex-Mex and Mex-Mex food, over several decades as a dedicated foodie.  I find this recipe lacking.  The pork, surprisingly, is very dry in texture.  The dominant flavor in the liquid is the piquant taste of hatch pepper.  FYI, the canned hatch peppers I used were "mild" as opposed to "hot," so it didn't dominate on the basis of heat.  Chipotle salsa?  The store where I shop had 3 of them, and I chose the one in which the chipotle content was by far the highest, judging on the basis of its order in the ingredient list.  Still, when the cook was over, the flavor was hatch, with scarcely any chipotle, and the texture of the meat, although cooked to the point where it pulled apart quite easily, was D R Y.  A version of pulled pork that approximates the East Carolina vinegar-based BBQ experience is achievable in a slow cooker, but based on this attempt, Mexican-style pulled pork is not.  Just saying.

Everyone couldn't stop raving about the pork at our Cinqo de Mayo party! For a 7 lb. pork butt,  I did one bottle of the chipolte sauce,  1 LG can and 1 sm can of diced chiles, 1 bottle of beer ( I think it was boston lager) the salt and garlic, and a major handful of fresh cilantro,  and put it in the oven on the slow cook method. That stayed in there for about 10 hours. It came out perfectly tender and flaking apart!! I added some cumin per some of the others suggestions after the pork was shredded. Then I just put it in the fridge for a few hours and warmed it before everyone came over.....Delicious!!

First time I have made mexican food by myself. I will be making this again soon. I get off of work very late and did not have 7 hours to wait, so this is what I did...

First I brouned the pork pieces on all sides, in a pot, on the stove.  I added all the ingredients as listed (except, used chicken stock instead of water.) Brought to a boil for maybe 10min, covered and continued cooking on medium. Preheated the oven to 350 degrees. Once preheated everything was put in a oven safe dish with a lid and put in the oven for appox 2 1/2 hours. Continue checking so meat doesnt become dry. This worked out excellent for me. My friend is begging me to make this for his birthday. This recipe is a keeper.

Only change we made was to add about a 1/2 cup of green taco sauce to the crockpot - giving it a little more liquid and a little more flavor.  Next time will quick up the spice factor with a hot habanero sauce. 

Served over a Spanish rice, topped with guacamole, sour cream, and shredded fiesta cheese.   Scooped up with tortilla chips - YUMMY!

Will definitely go into our dinner rotation.

The pork was delicious!  I halved the recipe and reduced the cooking time to 4 1/2 hours.  So tender!  I used 1 1/2 peppers in adobo sauce instead of plain sauce.  Looking back, I guess I forgot to add the 1/4 cup water.      The rice that was recommended was NASTY.  I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because the title says Mexican Style Shredded Pork and doesn't mention the rice.  I'll definitely serve the pork again, but this time I'll serve it with corn tortillas.

This was awesome, I was told by one of my guests that "this is restarant good", I did make a couple of changes, I had a hard time finding chipotle sauce so I just got a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and the green chilies, instead of just putting the peppers right on top of the roast I  put into a blender and pureed them, (my kids don't like pieces of peppers in thier food) I poured that over the pork and let it cook for about 7 hrs. Served it with corn tortillas and garnished with onions/lime and cilantro.  It was a total hit, I have made a couple of times since. one note it is pretty spicy with the additional chipotle peppers but that's the way we like it. thanks for 
the great recipe!!

I couldn't find the chipotle sauce, so I used verde salsa.  Followed the recipe exactly, but also added cumin when shredding and putting back in the crock pot.  I thought it turned out well and my family loved it.  We used the meat in tacos.  Could use more flavor if eating alone, but with toppings it tastes great.  The meat is so tender and falls apart.  No knife needed.  Couldn't have been easier.  I will make again!

I made the recipe to use for pork tacos.  My only addition was 1/2 of a chopped onion when putting everything in the crockpot.  The meat was tender, very flavorful but too spicy or salty.  It was a huge hit at our family dinner and everyone went back for seconds on the tacos!

I wanted to love this, but like others was disappointed with the lack of flavor. Added more chipolte sauce and that helped(used Cholula brand chipolte sauce). Not worth the money I spent on the pork loin to make again. :-(

I followed the recipe exactly except I think (by accident) I used more chipolte sauce and I used adobo to seasn the meat instead of salt.  Next time I will use an additonal can of green chiles.  Even my kids ate it and it wasn't too spicy for them.  I served with flour tortillas and all the fixin's!  YUM

Mediocre results.  I went to the trouble and expense of finding all the right ingredients.  Not worth it.

GOOD STUFF, this was excellent. However, I did take some suggestions from some previous reviews. I used an entire beer, a half of an onion, cuman, lime juice, an extra can of peppers, and chilli powder. Now I could not find chipotle sauce, so I took the canned with adoba and made my own using the entire can. I was afraid it was going to be to hot but it was Great, I will make this again.

The meat was very tender and delicious! I recommend to keep in the crock pot for the full 7 hrs for true tenderness. Tasted meat after 4 hrs and then 7 hrs...the best after 7 hrs on low. Rice was awesome and could use with other Mexican dishes. Great + EASY recipe...will make again!

I found some boneless pork ribs for super cheap (only $1.29/lb) and used about 3.5 lbs cut into roughly 2 inch pieces.  Like just about everyone else, I used canned chipoltis (about 5 oz) with a splash of water to get a nice sauce and fire roasted green chiles. I used about twice as much of the chipolti sauce and we're divided if it is spicy or wicked spicy. Very good and easy to modify if you're feeding kids or people who don't like spicy.  Will try the method again when we want a different mexican style chicken.

I used a pork tenderloin, I didn't cut it up, put the whole tenderloin in the crock pot topped with green chilies, and sweet chopped onions, and minced garlic, and lime juice, I did not add any water. I used some cumin, paprika and red pepper flakes instead of Chipotle. The pork was tender enough to easily shred with forks after six hours, then I left it another hour to soak up the juice. We used it in enchiladas...I done this with chicken also.

I wanted something closer to authentic carnitas so when this finished cooking, I did not shred.  Instead I put it in the oven and roasted at 450 for about 20 minutes to brown it up a little bit.  We served with corn tortillas and topped with jalapeños, a little shredded cheese and sour cream.  Very good.

This disappeared off the table. This is not overrated! Such a simple and delish meal! My son ate 4 tacos in corn tortillas with jack cheese and the juice ran down his arm! The rest of us ate it with cilantro rice. I am so grateful to you for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

I'm reviewing this as a taster, not a cook...My husband prepared this for us without modifications, and it was very yummy! I used it in tacos to which I added some cheese and lettuce and a roasted pepper salsa I had on hand. I'm marking this one for future make ahead ideas for weekends away... so many possibilities

Wonderful, I love all the suggestions in the reviews - I used beer instead of water, doubled the cilantro and put it and the lime juice in with the pork, added onions - delicious!!!  Tasty served with tortillas, rice and beans. Ole! 
Suggestion: if you're trying to do this without a crock pot, my dear friend was always cooking things in a low (300 degrees F) oven for about 3-4 hours, with wonderful results.

Soooooooo good!!! We enjoyed this thoroughly. I wrapped this up in enchiladas with a sour cream/cheese/onion sauce, and poured red enchilada sauce over the top along with shredded Monterey jack cheese. Awesome!

Delicious!  I was trying to replicate the pork they use at my favorite fresh Mex restaurant.  This recipe was almost perfect--I just sweetened it with pureed raisins (a suggestion from a friend who lived in Mexico) to taste.

I changed this recipe only slightly. My grocery store had pork loin ends on sale so I used those. I browned them in a Dutch oven first and placed them on a plate as they browned. I took a whole large vadalia onion and cut it into wedges I put the onions in the Dutch oven just to pick up all the brown bits and added the garlic for a minute. Dumped the onions and garlic in the crock pot, dumped the meat and juices from the plate in and added the remaining ingredients. I cooked as instructed. LOVE , LOVE , LOVED IT,!  I was at first pulled to this recipe by the rice - my husband loves cilantro.

So delicious! Did tweak it a bit, though, but I'm sure it would have been delicious otherwise. Here's what I did different: I used garlic salt, added an onion cut in wedges as well as a handful of cilantro (still on the stems for easy removal) and 1 can of light beer instead of water. After cooking on low for 5 hours, I took the cilantro out, as well as scooped all the onion. Shredded meat and put back in slow cooker on "warm" for about 2 hours (until dinner time). Meat was so juicy and tender! Served with Mexican rice, refried beans, corn tortillas, chopped onion and cilatro, lime wedges and avocado. : )

I made this a week ago and am still enjoying the different ways I can use the meat for meals! I did not have chili peppers or chilpotle sauce so I just used about a half a jar of chopped jalapenos and a can of diced tomatoes. I covered the meat with a Corona beer and it is fabulous! I have defrosted it in a pot with some butter, olive oil, brown rice and seasonings and it is a fabulous chunky soup with lots of good flavor. I will most definetly be making this again, next time I will add the rice right to the crock while the meat cooks to make it an even faster meal.

This is a great, very tasty recipe!  Super easy and quick to assemble.  I couldn't find chipolte sauce so i used chipolte salsa, which went great. (I like chunks of veggies in my sauces anyway)  I also added a sqeeze of one lime, one chopped onion,  and 1 tsp of cumin, as others suggested.  I served it in whole wheat tortillas, topped with sour cream, avocado, cheese and lime.  Was a big hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  My family really liked it!   I didn't have lime for my rice, so I'm thinking Spanish Rice would have been better than just plain rice w/cilantro.  We really liked this recipe!

This is very good.  I made a few changes though.  I used 1/2 cup of corona, 1/2 an onion and 1/4 cup of chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  Added a little cumin in at the end.

Well shucks, I was let down by this one.  The reviews are so positive that I was sure I had a winner for busy day easy pork tacos.  It was easy and it smelled wonderful but the flavor was not quite like I expected. It seemed like a confused chili verde sauce to me. The pork was also mushier than I cared for.  I will go back to beef in the crock pot for shredded meat tacos and continue to smoke and pull our pork when we want the chipotle/bbq style tacos.

Couple tips....brown the pork sholder before putting in the slow cooker. About 3-4 mins. on each side should be fine. Tossed in 1/4 cup of CHILI SAUCE, not CHIPOLTE and was just fine with flavor, for room to add hot saice if needed as garnish. Also two cans of diced green chilis and about 2 table spoons of chipolte peppers is just the right amount of heat! Soooo goood!! ENJOY!

GREAT pork recipe for tacos. I stuck to the recipe except I added some extra chipolete peppers and adobe sauce but only because I used wild game and it is a bit harder to season. I will definitely make again once hubby gets us another hog. Recipe is a keeper! Thank you!

Every Friday is "Fiesta Friday" at our house.  I try and make a new mexican/latin inspired dish every week.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot...and I'm so glad I did!!  This was unbelievably delish!  I followed the recipe exactly but I cut the pork into 1/2 to 1 inch pieces and left it that way because my husband doesn't like shredded meat.  Also, I was runnging late so I decided to quickly saute the pork before throwing it in the crockpot.  It worked out great!  It only got to simmer in there for 2 hours, but it was so tender and yummy you would have never known.  We served the meat and rice in a burrito "Chipotle" style.  Amazing!!  We loved it so much we're having a repeat this Friday!  We'll be making this a lot!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

After shredding the pork we had no juice left and it was a bit dry.  It was also a bit too spicy and wanted to tame it down a bit.  We added about a cup of salsa and half of a can of cola.  We let that simmer for a bit longer.  This was delicious!  The cola helped sweeten up the pork a bit.  Next time I'll add the salsa a cola at the beginning.  SO YUMMY!

Great recipe!  My family is not really very fond of pork, but I've made this twice now and my family loves it.  Stores great and makes wonderful sandwiches later.  It's especially good packed in a lunch with a little BBQ sauce on it.  This worked great with a pork loin roast, and I also made it with some thick cut pork loin chops I had in the freezer.

I followed the recipe except I added 3/4 cup of beer to the mix and added the lime juice into the crock pot too. I used Tabasco chipotle sauce. At the end when I shredded the pork and put it back in the pot I added in the cilantro and let it cook for another 30 minutes. I skipped the whole rice recipe and just served this in tortillas with other fixings. DELICIOUS!

Rice? What rice? This poor roast never stood a chance to even hit the plate! It was Dee-lish! I was too lazy to cut the roast and I misread the recipe and added the lime juice to the slow-cooker, but all that aside, it was superb. It's amazing what a few simple ingredients will do. This commands a repeat performance.

I made this dish for a "southwestern" dinner party I hosted.  I had a lot of things to do before the party, and was in search of something EASY.  There was a lot of other food begin brought over, so I must admit that I wasn't terribly concerned whether this recipe was an award winner or not...  But I tell you what -- not only was it incredibly easy, but it IS an award winner.  I was so pressed for time in the morning that I didn't even cut up the pork before putting it in the crock pot -- I just tossed it in whole.  It still came out tender and was easy to pull apart with a fork. The was the only change I made.  All my friends RAVED about it (and they're all a bit finicky).  I could not have been more pleased, and have made it two times since.  My friends have made it as well.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!!!!!!!

I had about a half an hour until dinner and was looking for a recipe to use up the extra shredded pork roast I had in the fridge.  I also was keeping an eye out for a recipe that would help me use the cilantro and oregano from the garden.  I loved the rice and I improvised with the pork quite a bit, using ingredients I had on hand.  Into a large covered pan I put the pork, chili peppers,and garlic.    Then I added salsa, fresh oregano, canned tomatoes with chili peppers, and cumin.  I let it simmer on low to let the pork absorb the flavor.  It was amazing!  Next time you have left over pork roast think of this recipe!

This was tasteless. I followed exact directions (using chipotle sauce) and this was awful. I had to add a bunch of seasonings to make it semi-edible...then my boyfriend grilled up some chicken for dinner.

Awful.

This pork dish is easy, delicious and has a fabulous taste, with a hint of Caribbean flavor. I cooked it in a covered dish in the oven with the same results, served it with the cilantro-lime rice, along with chili rellano casserole, chicken enchiladas and many other condiments. Some guests made fajitas, some made burritos and others ate it as it was over rice. I used this website for ideas for my husband's 60th Birthday and everything was a hit!  I served out all of the recipes with every guest and then some!

This was great!  Very easy.  My 10-, 15-, and 18-year old kids all liked it, too!  I doubled the recipe for my family of 5.  Made quite a bit.  Enjoying the leftovers.  I fixed it just like the recipe said.  Love the chipotle sauce - mmmmgood.  I found the chipotle sauce in the Mexican foods area of my local grocer.  Since I'm an onion lover, I put chopped onions on top when serving it - great!  Didn't have the quacamole, but would like to try it next time.  I can imagine this filling in an enchilada, tamale, burrito.  We've also made some quesadillas with the filling - quick snack or meal.  At first I thought this might be too hot for my kids, but it wasn't.  I love HOT/spicy stuff so I bought a fresh jalepeno to chop up to sprinkle on top. mmmmm.  You ought to try this one!

The cook on the pork was perfect. Was not dry and shredded like a dream. Served with Pico de Gallo with Cabbage (Mexican Coleslaw) from this site with sour cream and avocado. Yum. Thanks for sharing TORA.V.

Thought this was a great starter recipe but needed some tweaking to make it good.  The addition of a drained can of rotel, about two tablespoons cumin, and extra cilantro mixed in with the meat improved the blandness. I also added more chipotle spice to give it more smokiness.

Made recipe as written. I am sensitive to spicy foods and was concerned this might be great for my family but not me. I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of flavor and tolerable spiciness. Will definitely make again!

My husband and I love this recipe. It's ridiculously easy and a great way to make a meal last a long time. I served the pork with a mexican cheese on the top after having it without the cheese. We prefer it with the cheese. It makes the other flavors come out more. This is in regular rotation in our house.

Wow!  What a great recipe!!  I followed Judy's review and couldn't' have been more pleased.  The only change I made from her suggestions was to use chicken breast (5-6) and put them in whole instead of pieces.  Seasoned them up good with the Mrs. Dash chipolte seasoning. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I want to follow some of the other reviewers suggestions about adding the cilantro and some lime juice to the meat, etc.  Maybe it's just me, but mine turned out tasting a whole lot like the chicken served at Chipolte's restaurants.  If it's not the same it's sure close!  A million thanks, Tora.v, for a fantastic recipe and to Judy for her helpful and delicious suggestions.  This recipe will long be enjoyed at our house!!

I made this exactly as written other than adding half a large onion.  I try to eat 85% Paleo so I didn't use rice or tortillas. Instead I served it as a kind of stew and had some refried beans as a side dish. Absolutely delicious and definitely will make again.

Where I live, the stores always have what they call "country-style" pork ribs and almost always have pork butt (Boston butt), so those are generally the most economical purchase. I have to de-fat the drippings, but the meat is more flavorful than pork loin. I follow recipes none too closely, adding more chipotle peppers (canned) than called for. Adding a small can of jalapenos suits our taste, too. Peppers are stronger when added at the tail-end of the cooking time; they will mellow themselves considerably during long cooking.

This was delicious. I did customize it a little. I cooked it in the crock pot for 7 hours and moved it to a pot with the juices over night. The next day I put it on a simmer for 4 hours. I served it with yellow rice and cole slaw on tortillas.

Great versatile recipe! Just the right amount of mild chili hotness. We have had this over rice as suggested but found it even better in a tortilla on a Mexican Torta sandwich and on nachos.

Was super easy and yummy! I made it even easier and used Minute rice instead of the long grain and it worked great!

One of the tastiest things I have ever made. I used almost a whole bottle of chipotle sauce, used yellow rice and mixed in cilantro and lime juice, also accompanied it with jiffy cornbread but added a fresh chopped jalapeno pepper and 1 cup of mexican blended shreaded cheese. This is terrific, even my kids loved it!! They are pretty picky.

Thought this was pretty good, but did end up making some changes because it was too mild for our liking.  I also could not find the chipotle sauce, so I used enchilada sauce and added some pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (as many other reviewers did).  My main issue with this recipe is that after cooking for 7 hours on low, mine was VERY watery and bland.  I ended up adding 3 more tbsp of the chipotle puree plus at least ~2 tsp of cumin.  Then I cooked it on low for an additional 3 hours with the lid off.  This resulted in some pretty tasty pork.  We served it as make your own burritos and the leftovers as quesadillas.  I think I will further experiment w/this recipe, perhaps trying beer instead of water and bumping up the spices even more.  Thought it was good, just needs a bit more flavor for our taste.

I wouldn't call this "amazing," but with some changes, it was good enough to make again. Normally, I don't cook pork tenderloin in the crockpot, but due to oven problems and a defrosted, 2lb tenderloin in my fridge, I decided to try this recipe. I dusted the tenderloin with salt and cumin and set it on top of a sliced onion and green bell pepper in the crockpot. I added chopped garlic on top of the tenderloin, along with chipotle salsa, lime juice, and a little water. I shredded the meat after 4 hours on low and added it back to the sauce. I served it with white rice, black beans and more salsa. Wish I'd had cilantro on hand to top it off with. It's hard to get a moist tenderloin in the crockpot, but this one turned out pretty well, and we liked the meal. The leftovers are also good. I'm giving this 3 stars because I altered the recipe and used plain rice. I'll probably make it again with the changes to the recipe.

This was so good! You can make this and use it to make a lot of different dish's. I used instant rice and added the cilantro and lime and mixed it up and let it sit and it was great! Had it with soft taco shells and my hubby loved it! Will make again, thanks!

I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes along with the green chile peppers and chipotle sauce which added great flavor.  I still added the water which I think is not necessary so next time I will just add the tomatoes and skip the water.

I just moved to Mexico City and made this for lunch one day.  The lady who works for me, who is Mexican, loved it so I had to translate the recipe for her.  Mine was a little more kicked up because I couldn't find canned green chiles, had to use canned jalapeños.  Still, it was a hit!

Like many other reviewers I could not find chipolte saue, so I used chille pepers in adobe sauce. I did not add the green chile peppers since I had already poured in the red, and it was HOT. We are fans of hot, so it was fine, but make sure you fish out the chili pepers when its done cooking. I also thought I had pork in the freezer (but didnt) and so I through a beef tenderloin in instead of pork. It was still great!

I made this for burritos and it was well-loved! The only differences: I used chipotle chiles in adobe sauce, added onions, cumin and more garlic. I cooked for 7 hours, shredded it, turned it off and then turned it on for another hour and a half to heat it up again for dinner (it was ready early). I think it came out better for it. My house smelled so yummy! Served with tortillas and lime chile black beans etc.

I rubbed the pork with cumin and chili pepper and marinated it overnight in the chipotle sauce along with minced garlic and onion and the two cans of green chilies. Added a little water to the crock pot and cooked on high for 6 hours. The meat was VERY tender- stirred the meat around with a fork and it shredded right in the crock pot. The taste was delicious- served along with cilantro lime rice, sliced avocado, shredded cheese, tortillas, and sour cream. Will definitely make again!

Phenomenal recipe. Like many others, I could not find chipotle sauce to save my life, so I opted to use Adobo chilies in chipotle sauce. They were easily removed at the end of cooking. We enjoyed this recipe "carnita" style: splashed with fresh lime, sprinkled with sea salt and combined with avocado, cilantro and red onion on whole wheat tortillas.

Easy to make, even easier to eat. I ended up with soft tacos the first day and shredded pork Taquitos on the second day. Both were perfect applications of this wonderfully spiced pork.

Awesome! This recipe is a keeper. It was really difficult to find chipotle sauce. I ended up using a can of chipotle peppers in a can that I found at Walmart. They were whole and I dumped in the whole can.  Next time I will just take one or two whole peppers from the can and blend it with some of the juice and add it.

We loved this...  tasted like we were in a great Mexican restaurant.  The only change I made was to not cut the pork into pieces at the beginning...I left it whole.  Wonderful flavor!  Yummm!!

used this as a burrito filling. could only find a 2 1/2 pound pork tenderloin, but it worked just fine. couldn't find the chipotle sauce, but got the 4 oz. can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, added water and purred it into sauce and used the 1/2 cup called for. it made 8 burritos, i shredded 8 ozs. of sharp cheddar cheese and divided it among the burritos. it's great! going to try this with beef also. this ones a keeper! didn't make the rice part of the recipe, just the meat.

Excellent!  Used the HOT chili peppers and am glad I did. When combined with the avocado dip and sour cream over the delicious rice with lime/cilantro - - we all ate too much. Very flavorful and look forward to pull pork sandwiches tomorrow! MMMMMM

Loved this - I made the rice with a bottled lime juice and it was a bit too "lime-y". :)  I also used brown rice to make it a bit healthier.  I couldn't find any chipotle sauce in our store so I bought the chipotles in adobo sauce and cut up about 4 or 5 chipotles and threw them in the crock pot.  When i first took the pork out and tasted it - it was okay, but once I shredded it and let it sit back in its own juices - it was superb.  I served it over the rice in a bowl.  Was very good.  Will definitely make again.  I think this would be good as enchiladas, tostadas, burritos, etc.

This recipe is awesome!  I have made it several times.  I live in Canada and can't seem to find chipotle sauce, so I buy the canned chipotles and use my hand blender to make a sauce with the green chilies.  I haven't made the rice, but do serve it with homemade corn tortillas.  Fabulous!

Excellent recipe! I use a generous amount of Chicken Taco seasoning from Penzey's to season the meat. 
I served this on top of rice and garnished with the Tomato, Corn and Avocado Salsa ( http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Tomato-Corn-and-Avocado-Salsa/Detail.aspx ) from this site. It was fabulous! Thanks!

As written, I was disappointed.  Yes, I used the chipotle sauce.  But when I shredded the pork and stirred it back in, I tasted it with the sauce to check the seasoning, and it was nearly flavorless--I could only taste a mild (for me) spiciness, but nothing else.  So I stirred in half a can of tomato paste, the remainder of the can of chipotle sauce, and a chopped onion, and let it cook on low for another hour, and then I was happy with it.

This was an awesome recipe.  I made it at a Mexican potluck and it was one of the dishes that people had seconds of.  I also had three people ask me for the recipe.  We will definitely make this again.

YUMMY! The only changes I made were to add some onion to the slow cooker and I added some chicken broth as well.  I served as tacos with lettue, cilantro, salsa, and cheese and it was AWESOME!

We love this recipe.  It couldn't be easier.  I also added some cilantro to the pork when cooking and used Tabasco Chipolte sauce.  There is great flavor and very moist.  Usually skip the rice and serve with tortilla's.  There is a little kick with the tabasco, but doesn't bother the little ones.

I accidentally got chopped jalapenos instead of chopped green chilies, and it was still great! I skipped the rice and served it as a taco filling with corn tortillas, sour cream, guacamole, black beans, shredded cheddar, and tomatoes. Easy and filling. Refrigerates and reheats well.

Delicious and easy. It's a great do-ahead recipe for company. I've done both in a slow cooker and in the oven. Make sure you shred the pork while it's still warm. I like it on lime-flavoured rice, as suggested, but my husband prefers to roll his up in a tortilla. Serve with warm apple enchiladas for dessert.

My husband and son just absolutely love this recipe! This is great for working moms, and even if it sits in the crock pot a few extra hours it still comes out tasting wonderful. I did add a bit of extra chipolte sauce before serving, but this is a wonderful low maintanance meal!

The pork came out wonderfully tender and was easy to shred. The seasonings were nice - a little bland for my taste, but my fiance raved about it. Will up the chipotle sauce next time. I did track down the sauce, in the Mexican foods section of my supermarket: the sauce definately makes or breaks this. Thanks for sharing!

Such an easy recipe! I cooked the boneless pork loin overnight on low. I used a chipotle hot sauce with only one can of green chiles (all I had). Ate mine as a burrito filling with sour cream and cheddar cheese. Will make again. Very easy to prepare. Made a lot of meat.

This is really, really good.  I can't believe how easy it was to make, and what a great flavor it had.  We ate this as a rice bowl, it was better than anything similar we've had in restaurants.  I followed the recipe as written, I was able to find the chipotle sauce, which I think does need to be included here -- gave it a nice kick and flavor.  Can't say enough good things about this!  :-)

This was a wonderful surprise. We really enjoyed this. I made some minor changes because  we live far from a store. I'm writing the changes for my own reminder. I had no green chilies so I used salsa verde and a couple ounces of jarred jalapeño peppers. I used 3 oz. chipotle sauce and added 2 chipotle peppers with adobo sauce.. After shredding I added a good tsp of cumin.  
   I did make rice as stated and found it went great with the meat.  We topped the rice and meat with queso fresco cheese, cilantro, diced tomatoes, salsa verde. YUM!  Thank you. We will make often.  Next time with green chilies.

Very good and full of juices! I added some cumin and lime juice to meat and removed the lime from the rice. This would be excellent in tamales or enchiladas. Feel free to use up to a cup of the chipotle sauce!

Added a chopped onion, 1 c of the chipotle sauce and no water while cooking-DELISH!! Served with rice and black beans (rinsed/drained), salsa verde (Goya's-green salsa), chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips for scooping. Oh Yeah!!!

Excellent!  Smelled kind of weird in the crockpot, but, tastes terrific!  We ate this at least 4 different ways over the week.  The lime rice was a hit!

Wow!  This is wonderful!  I made this for a taco bar at a graduation party.  It was so flavorful and easy to make.  I didn't have the chipotle sauce so subbed a little liquid smoke and some chili powder.  Bet I would have liked it even more with the chipotle sauce!!  Will certainly make again!

This was delicious but I made a few changes to it. I added a lot of extra spices like cumin, chili powder, etc and added some chopped onion. Also added a lot more cilantro. It was very tender and I ate it in salad and rice with veggies, yogurt, salsa the works. Thanks!

I tried this recipe last week following the recipe exactly. I wasn't impressed.. at all. In fact it was the furthest thing from that recognizable Tex Mex succulent richness as could be. Even the cooking time was to long resulting in the pork being dry.

Last night I tried a second time adding many of the suggestions I found here (corona beer, cumin, onion, a mix of canned and fresh peppers, etc.) Cut the cooking time by 30 minutes. It finally earned the 5 stars I've seen so many give this dish. And had that authentic Tex Mex'ness.

However, by the time I was able to get this to that 5 star rated dish it was no longer close to the original recipe.

This was excellent and the rice was a great combo.  Don't over think when you do a crockpot recipe...let the flavour develop.  My wife did a homemade quacamole with this and we add salsa and sour cream and everyone had more than 1 serving.  this is a keeper + it is so simple.  Thank you Tora V.

The chipotle sauce makes this dish a success. Hubs poked one fork into the pot before serving and said "This is the best pork you've ever made!" He couldn't resist grazing from the pot each time my back was turned. So incredibly simple with savory results. I served it on a bed of spanish yellow rice to which I added the cilantro. Topped it all off with shredded cheese, a dollop of guacamole, and a warm flour tortilla on the side. Muy bueno!

Delicious!  Used scissors to cut meet while in slow cooker.  Turned out great!  Can be used with rice or as tacos.  I did both.  The pork counteracts nicely with the cilantro rice.

This dish was easy to make and tasted GREAT! The original recipe made sort of a lot, so 
I froze some of the meat. It froze very well and was just as moist and tasty after thawing out! So very glad to have found this recipe! I will definitely use it time and time again!

We loved this! I couldn't find chipotle sauce but I did find chipotle chili powder in the bulk section of the grocery store and added about a teaspoon or so. It smelled absolutely fabulous! Served it with Homemade flour tortillas & Mexican rice, from this site, & a can of refried beans and avocado slices.

This was to die for!!!!  Followed it exactly to the recipe, only left the pork whole but it shredded EASILY!  I did find that the Tabasco brand had a Chipotle sauce so used that and again, taste was fantastic!  I did try the rice as well, I liked it although it tasted better the next day but on that, you definitely need to use enough ingredients to your own taste, I used a whole lot more cilantro because we love the stuff.  Even threw some in the roast at the end.  Love all of the reviews as it helps me to know what works and what doesn't since I am not a real experienced cook!  Planning on making this for an upcoming party, yummy!

this was good, and different.  hubby asked for this to be served as sandwiches, so that's what we did, however i later wished i'd made it into a rice bowl or something else more authentically mexican.  it felt like a more oddly flavored bbq pulled pork.  but it was good, and the meat was tender.  kids wouldn't eat it, though (what else is new!!??)

Tasty and so easy!  I chopped up a fresh cubanelle pepper instead of the cans of green chiles and it worked out well.

I buy my meat at the local Mexican supermarket and they called the piece of pork I bought a "pork chunk" It was a big (3#) flat pork roast that had one bone still in it. I cooked it according to Tora V.'s recipe and let me tell you we LOVED it. I added a bunch of cumin, chipotle chili pepper powder, paprika and onion powder along with a finely chopped onion and red bell pepper (I had no canned green chili). So, it doesn't matter if you don't have the more expensive pork loin. The thing that really knocked our socks off was putting cilantro and lemon juice in the rice! Such a wonderful flavor! We liked making wet burritos from the meat and serving the rice separate, allowing the wet burrito to drip the luscious pork juices onto the rice on our plates. Muy Bueno!

This is the best pork for tacos!  The family made tacos and I made a rice bowl.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor.

Absolutely wonderful.  Don't change a thing, this recipe is awesome.  So much flavor! I used two forks to tear the pork apart.

I've made this twice - the first time I used a can of chipotles in adobo sauce instead of the chipotle sauce, and it was great. Then I tried it as written last night - again, great. After it was cooked I put some of the shredded pork into a frying pan and crisped it up, creating carnitas. Crispy, yummy good and we'll use the leftovers in burritos with the rice. Like the rice so much it's how I prepare it now.

I was really excited for this recipe, made it as is, and the pork came out a bit on the bland side and not at all what I expected.  As for the rice, it came out a little  mushy.  Maybe browning the rice in a little bit of oil first would have made a difference with less water.

I added cumin as other suggested, and also extra chipotle sauce because it was lacking flavor. The meat just fell apart when I took it out to shred it. Did not make the rice but stuffed enchiladas with the meat, it was delicious!

Excellent recipe! I recently lost my job and had to cut back on our grocery budget, which meant I needed to find more creative things to do with pork! This recipe is a favorite in my house, and can easily cost less than $10 for the entire meal.

This is one of the best and easiest recipes on the site. My husband said he will love me forever if I keep making this. I made the pork exactly according to the recipe, and I thought it was delicious. Instead of rice, we put the pork tortillas and topped with a little cheese. I couldn't find the chipotle in the supermarket, but I found it in a local Latin food mart.

This is probably one of my favorite recipies.  Since finding this, I have made this at least twice a month.  It really helps with meal preparations for an entire week.  One the first day, I just make tacos just as recomended in the recipe. But remember, these are merely suggestions.  Use your imagination and creativity.  I also use the meat to make flautas, burritos, enchiladas, empanadas, chilaquiles, and tortilla soup.  This is an excellent recipe for the busy mom but plan out your menu so that you use all of the delicous meat.

Sorry but this was only 'ok' for me. I followed the recipe as it was written and tasted it at the end....a little bland so I added some more salt, juice of 1/2 a lime and a handful of fresh cilantro. This helped. But it was still lacking 'something'. It tasted good once it was topped with some refried beans, cheese, guac, sr cream and salsa but on its own it just didn't do it for me. Sorry.

SO good and SO easy!! I just finished eating this a few minutes ago and had to rate it right away!! I love that it basically cooks itself. This is definitely restaurant quality and I will be making it all the time. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! I did use only one can of chilies instead of two. And the chipotle sauce I found was called "Chipotle Salsa" but it was definitely more of a sauce so I figured it would work. I used the whole can instead of just 1/4 cup. It was a 7 oz can. Other than those two minor changes, I followed this recipe just as written and it turned out amazing. We served it over plain white rice and had sour cream, guacamole and the "Confetti Coleslaw" from this site on the side. I ended up putting the coleslaw right on top of the pork. Yum!! This meat is so moist and delicious. It falls apart as you are shredding it. If you like mexican food even just a little, you must try this recipe!!!

This recipe is not as juicy as BBQ pulled pork, but I did like the taste.  I did not have canned chile peppers, but cut up a bunch of chile peppers.  Between those and the chipotle sauce, it gave the pork a nice spicy kick!

Wow! Awesome and easy! I added an onion and I didn't make the rice just the pork and served it with tortillas, avocados, sour cream, tomatoes and cheese so my family and guests could make burritos or have a bowl of shredded pork with all the sides.

So many possibilities & great flavor!! I couldn't find the chipolte sauce either, used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce by just chopping 2 pepper and using all the sauce. Added about 1/2 a jar of Pace Hot salsa, mrs dash chipolte seasoning, cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder and a small chopped onion. Served 1)over spanish rice topped w/ shredded cheese, salsa and sour cream, 2)did the same in a soft shell tortilla, 3)put on hoagie buns w/ cheese & salsa and had sandwich style, 4)put on hoagie buns another time w/ pepperconi peppers and cheese  and toasted in oven topped w/ salsa. did not do this way but next time will use for enchiladas.

Delicious! I wasn't able to find chipotle sauce so pureed a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and used the stated amount, which gave it a wondeful, smoky flavor. The roast came out a little dry; not a complaint but worth mentioning. Will definitely make again.

I bought a 2.25lb pork roast and it was done cooking and started drying out after 5 hours.  I added the rest of the bottle of beer to try to keep things moist.  I also added a few jalapenos in juice at the beginning.  We enjoyed this pork and I will definitely make again.

I didn't have chipolte sauce on hand but I had chile in adobo sauce so I just used that. When I took the pork out to shred, I removed the whole chiles because I didn't want to be too crazy spicy for my kids. For those that like heat, this would be perfect for you, even with the chiles removed, it was still SPICY ! But good ! I didn't make rice with lime snd cilantro. Instead I used the squeezed lime juice on the finished shredded pork, and garnished with sprinkling of cilantro on top. My family actually ate mini slider style using dinner rolls. Flavors are great !

Very good!  I used an extra can of chillis and used the Tabasco chipolte sauce.  I've made it with the roast like the recipe calls for, but have also made it with a variety of pork cuts (like chops) and that was good also. We ate it in tortillas with refried beans and mexican rice.  Just as good as the resturants!

This was OK, however, I found the sauce to be a little too watery and my pork kind of tough.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

This was pretty good. Although, my favorite part was the lime juice I squeezed on it at the end and that wasn't in the recipe.  At with the rice in tortillas with cheese, guacamole, etc.

I love this recipe! I did add one 8 oz can of regular cream cheese spread and it came out even better. I use this recipe for my enchiladas or just serve it with tortillas and rice. LOVE IT!

I've made this before and it's always a hit with everyone.  I, like some other people, substituted beer for the water, and I added some extra lime on top at the end. I served it with toppings you'd use for fahitas, such as sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and we wrapped them in a flour torillia.  Other thing I have done, is put the meat on top of a big round and flat hard shell tortilla you can find in the mexican section in the grocery store.

Great, easy recipe.  Next time I will make tacos rather than serve it over rice.  I was unable to find chipotle sauce, so put in 1/4 cup cut up chipotle peppers instead.  It became very spicy, so I don't really recommend that.

Came out great!!  Served with full Cinco de Mayo buffet.  Most people put it over the yellow rice.  Watch how much chile/adobo you add - can get very hot quickly.

Very good.  Cooked perfectly and just the right amount of seasoning.  I might use a little less of the chipotle sauce next time.  It seemed to overpower the garlic and green peppers.  I used kosher salt to season the meat and mixed the garlic in with it.  It was a nice rub for the meat.

Easy and perfect! Served with rice, black beans, finely shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar, fresh salsa, sour cream and tortilla chips for scooping. Better than Chipotle's "burrito in a bowl"!

THIS RECIPE REALLY NEEDED MORE TASTE.  I ADDED 1 ONION, CHOPPED, 1 1/2 T. CUMIN AND 1/4 CUP SALSA AND TWO CANNED CHIPOTLES MINCED. I WILL ADD THE BEER NEXT TIME.  I HAD TO COOK IT TWO HOURS LONGER. MEAT A LITTLE CHEWY BUT VERY TASTY WITH ADDITIONS ON TACOS AND BURRITOS.

We make this all time, it's WONDERFUL!
The only thing I change from the original recipe is to use beer for the water used with the pork (as a previous commenter did)...we love it like that. 
This is even better the next day, IF you have any leftovers ;-)

This was great. Tasted just like I get at my favorite Mexican  restraurant. I have passed this on to my family and friends.
I did add the cumin and southwestern spice that others suggested. I will make this again and again. A real keeper.!

This is absolutely a family favorite!! All three of my children love it(ages 2-14). I too add the lime to the rice after cooking so it doesn't get sticky. We just serve on the cilantro rice with shredded cheese, guacamole and salsa. Leftovers make great quesadillas too.

This is a really great base recipe! I tried it as written plus a little cumin and cilantro and it was delicious! I think next time though I'll try adding some Taco Seasoning I too. The best part is that people can change it up how they like it! It's going to become a staple in my home. Just a question though.. would this work with other meats? Beef and chicken?

My family loved this and my eldest son asked for the leftovers to take home.  We like our food spicy so I added double the amount of chipotle sauce and served more sauce on the side.  I also put the cilantro into the shredded pork instead of in the rice.  Very good dinner, we'll have it again.

I agree with everyone else - this was excellent and SUPER easy. It makes a great burrito filling. I wasn't sure what to buy for the Chipotle sauce, so I would put out there for others that Tabasco makes a Chipotle sauce in a jar just like their Tabasco Sauce. I found it near the ketchup, BBQ sauces, and bottled marinades.

Excellent recipe. To tweak up the flavor, I added sliced onion, crushed garlic, and sprinkled the uncooked pork with Mexican seasoning. I used a whole pork butt--there is no need to cut up the meat before putting it in the crock pot. It shredded easily after 7 hours. After shredding I poured out some of the liquid and added a couple more tablespoons of chipotle sauce. I used Tabasco Chipotle, which was fine. We served it over the lime rice, my wife and I  both agreed next time we would use it as a filling to make fabulous burritos!

This was an excellent meal!  I added some cumin, salt, and pepper after I shredded the pork.  We ate some on flour tortillas and some over the rice, with cheese, sour cream, and Fresh Salsa 1 from this website.  Thanks!

This was really good. Not outstanding, but very good.  Followed recipe, except I added onions to slow cooker.  Even better reheated the next day.  topped with green onions and chopped tomatoes ( no salsa on hand). Definately will make again.

My family enjoyed this dish quite a bit.  I asked was it a 4-star or 5-star meal.  The said 5!  I only changed one thing: I added the cilantro to the cooked rice and let it sit for a few minutes before serving instead of cooking it in with the rice.  Leftovers became pulled pork sandwiches on toasted wheat buns for a summer's afternoon lunch.  Thanks!

This was very easy. The flavor was milder than I anticipated, which was good for my kids. I mixed the leftovers in some bbq sauce for a pulled-pork bbq sandwich and that was quite good!

Very Yummy pork.  I would've given it 4 stars, but I didn't want to count points off since I changed a few things.  Used a pressure cooker to cook the meat in less than an hour (falling apart tender), didn't make the rice, served with fresh guacamole and salsa as taco filling.  Will definitely make again.

I think I could live off of this recipe.  It was great.  The part for the rice, I didn't have the ingredients for so I served with plain basamti rice which was wonderful.  Although, I believe a large chain mexican restaurant from Denver CO, serves their rice in a similiar fashion and I love their rice!  Also, I used chipotle sauce from a can in with the traditional mexican food items.  I made these into enchiladas by making an enchilada sauce and using lots of cheese and they were great.  Then I froze some (freezes well) and then turned that into soft tacos.  A very versatile, simple, and delicious recipe.  This will get plenty of use in my home.

I couldn't find chipotle sauce at the store, so I used chipotle salsa. I meant to sprinkle some cilantro in at the last minute but forgot to. I also didn't make the rice, but simply served the pork with beans, cheese, sour cream, olives and salsa. Hopefully this will freeze well, because I have alot leftover.

This was very good.  The rice was not good at all but the roast was.  It is even better the next day bc all the flavors have married together.  I woul definitely recommend the meat part but the rice part I would leave out.

This was like WOW!  I used it as taco meat.  Couldn't find chipotle sauce in the store, so I used taco sauce instead and added chipotle pepper to spice it up.  Did add lime to sauce to add a little zing.  It was great.  Would likely work for chicken or beef, too.

Awesome!  The chipotle tobasco sauce is the way to go.  I couldn't find it at first, but I'm glad I did.  We'll be making this a lot.

I prepared this recipe exactly as given and while the meat was very tender, I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  It was missing something that I can't put my finger on.  Mine came out with a smoky flavor, but other than that was kind of bland.  I'm going to try some of the other suggestions here to perk it up a little next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This rocked!  I used a can of PBR instead of water, and Bufalo chipotle sauce (less than the amount on the recipe) and put some fresh oregano in.  8 hours later, my crockpot was happy :)

Didn't do rice; whupp'd up some guac and did tacos, nummmmmmm

I didnt do the rice.  I added lime juice to the roast, some cumin and chili powder, and some cilantro, and 1 chopped onion.  I didnt cut the roast up, I put it in whole and after about 3-4 hours on high I took it out and shredded it and put it back in the crockpot for another hour or so.  It was yummy!  Made corn tortillas and topped with sour cream and shredded mexican cheese.

We are huge carnitas fans but were not thrilled with this recipe. My cut of meat came out really dry and flavorless. As with other posts, there is just not a clear definition as to what the "chipotle sauce" is supposed to be. But I used canned chipotles in adobo. (About 1 or 2 tablespoons, minced.) There is no way you could use a 1/4 cup. After I made this, I did see a new product in a box by Knorr simply labeled "Chipotle".  Maybe that would help with the flavor.  
As for the rice, we liked it. But I just stirred in the lime juice when I turned off the rice.

Very tasty, the meat was very juicy and easy to shred.  I only used one can of chilies and did not make the rice; we just ate the meat wrapped in tortillas.  I plan on using the rest of the meat in enchiladas.  Excellent recipe!

This dish was very good on yellow rice with guacamole, salsa, cheddar, and sour cream.  
The leftovers were rolled into warm corn tortillas and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese.  YUMM......

Amazing!  I will definitely be making this often...easy & tasty.  I also could not find chipotle sauce so I used Lawry's "Baja Chipotle w/ lime" marinade.  We served the pork over rice and made soft tacos w/ it.  Awesome!

The meat was bland.  It was also dry despite allowing it to absorb the liquid after shredding it. Due to the expense of the pork loin I can't recommend this recipe - it just wasn't worth it.
I'm disappointed because it sounded good plus I like using my crockpot but this recipe didn't measure up.

I couldn't find chipotle sauce and ended up using chipotle salsa instead.  I increased it to 1/2 cup but it did not turn out very spicey.  Will spice up the meat more the next time.  The meat was tender but I had to increase the cooking time to at least 8 1/2 hours on low.  It did not yield enough sauce for my taste so for left overs I will add a can of spicy enchilada sauce.
My husband did not like the rice with the lime juice I did not mind it so much but I will serve it with spanish rice the next time.  
Overall it was good but not nearly spicy enough for our taste.

This came out amazing! I had a 5lb pork loin roast so I used about a half cup of chipotle sauce but that was the only difference and it came out amazing! The rice was the best part. I used 8 servings of rice (just made it from the package directions) I added a little more than a half cup of fresh chopped cilantro and my grocery store was out of limes so I had to use lime juice from a bottle but still came out delicious!! Will make again

The recipe was so easy and was a hit! I fried it a little after I shredded it coz it made too much sauce in the slow cooker but the sauce itself is tasty! The cilantro lime rice was yummy! Glad I came across this recipe. Kudos to the one who shared it

As written, this was pretty good. But even with the chipotle sauce it was a little bland. So after it was cooked I added 2 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp granulated garlic. That helped give it some flavor and a little heat. There was also a lot of liquid. This made a lot (for 2 people). We had it over rice one day, in enchiladas another day, in tacos another day and we still have some leftover for another meal. 

I will make this again, but use less water (or maybe broth), add more chipotle sauce and add the spices at the end. I plan to divide this into bags and freeze for quick meals. Just thaw and add to enchiladas, tacos or pizza.

Took awhile to find chipotle sauce at the grocery store but I did on the bottom shelf of the Latin American isle. I diced the roast into large chunks as stated in the recipe and put in slow cooker with one can chipotle sauce and some water and some of Mrs. Dash's Chipotle seasoning, as another reviewer suggested. I found the pork a little too difficult to shred so I put a couple spoonfuls into my food processor with some of the liquid and got a beautiful and flavorful - but not too strong - shredded port.

Fantastic!  Since couldn't find Chipotle sauce in the super markets where I live, made a homemade version of it, easy & yummy by adding 1 TBLS. of tomato paste, 1 TBLS. cider vinegar, 1 tsp. of Paprika, 1/8 tsp. Cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. of ground cumin, 1 tsp. of garlic & onion powders , 1 TBLS. of taco seasoning & salt.  Then followed the recipe as stated.  Served it with a side of Mexican rice & red beans, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, low fat Mexican cheese blend, salsa and warmed flour tortillas.   Thank you TORA.V. for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

We enjoyed this dish.  I made it as directed to begin with.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I did add some cumin to the shredded pork at the end to give it a bit more flavor.  When I tasted the pork cooked as directed, the flavor was mild.  Cooking the rice  with the lime juice was a nice change, but I will cut back on the lime juice next time - maybe use half the recommended amount.  The rice had a rather pronounced lime flavor, and I think I would prefer it to be more subtle.

Meat had a good taste and smelled wonderful. I cooked it on high for 4 hours cause of time, and it didn't turn out as tender as I would have liked.  I would cook it on low for 7 hours next time if I make it again.  I also added a small diced onion which I would add again.

I used this recipe as a guideline only because I was short on ingredients.  I replaced salt with 2 tbsp of taco seasoning. 1 can of green chiles and one can of mild ro-tel.  I didnt add rice or water.  I did add half of a red onion, garlic, lime juice,cilantro and a couple tablespoons of some pretty hot sauce. No added water.  This was so tasty.  Spicy but not hot.  I really apologize for hi-jacking this recipe  but some posters said it lacked flavor and this combination of ingredient did not disappoint.

Have to say I quite disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading the other reviews.  I didn't add rice but used all the other ingredients.  The sauce was watery and had no flavour or heat.  After chilling the sauce and removing the fat I re-heated it with some corn starch to thicken it.  I'll be looking for  another recipe.

This was really good. I think next time I'll use more chipotle sauce to intensify the flavor a bit, but otherwise no complaints.

I didn't cut the roast before I put it in the crock pot, and it turned out amazing. This is one of my very favorite recipes. I plan to add one can of diced jalapenos along with the chiles to add some heat.

Did not go well for me at all. Not sure what I did wrong. Meat did not shred at all. Had to put it in the food processor. It was edible, but not worth ever making again.

This is an all time family favorite! You don't even have to use Chipotle sauce. We have tried it using regular salsa, and I have even made it just using fresh from the garden vegetables put through a food processor (1 onion, 2 green bell peppers, some cherry tomatoes I had, a few green tomatoes, cilantro, a thai chili pepper, and garlic). I don't think there is any way you can wrong with this recipe. It adapts well to changes in heat (spice). Great with the chipotle, but we switched to salsa because our children are still young. We now just use part green salsa and part regular salsa or a can of diced tomatoes (whatever you have on hand). It is literally awesome no matter what you do! On average we let it cook about 12-16 hours to fully break down the pork and let all the juices infuse throughout.

The second time it was okay. Not sure what I did differently but this recipe is not amazing IMO.

This turned out very good.  Next time I will probably add more green chile peppers and other spices to the meat before cooking.

Delish! Used a 2 lb pork loin, substituted beer for the 1/2c water, 1/2 a lime squeezed over that and at the very end after shredding the meat I added a 1/2 T of cumin. This was excellent. Served over the rice with Tortilla chips and corn. YUM

This was delicious! I did add lime juice and cilantro before cooking as others suggested but I made no other changes to the seasoning. I served it in soft taco shells with avocado, cilantro, tomato and sour cream but I'll try the cilantro lime rice for my leftovers. My only error was to salt the meat too heavily- it didn't need it.

I changed the recipe a little because of what I had on hand and it turned out amazing!!  I used 1 butterflied porkchop, salt, 1 can green chilies, 1 can rotel,  garlic, full 7oz can chipotle sauce and 1/4 cup lime in the crock pot on low for 6 hours, shredded chops and then continued to cook on low for 30 minutes while cooking the rice as directed.

This is one of my family's favorite dinners. It's so easy to make and so flavorful. It's very versatile too, you can pretty much add any combination of spices that appeals to your specific tastes.

My friend from Mexico said this recipe was really close to what she was used to. To really finish it off in carnitas style, you would take the shredded pork & spread it out on a cookie sheet w/ a little of the liquid & put it in the oven until the tips get crispy. (seriously concentrated MEAT FLAVOR!) Also can be deep fried, but I couldn't bring myself to do that.

This is an amazing recipe! I made Mexican style quinoa instead of the rice. Also, I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning first. It came out perfectly and is now a household favorite!!

This was good...we served it in fresh corn tortillas w/cilantro, guacamole by Bob Cody from this site, sour cream and cheese instead of over rice. Everyone liked it but could have been a little more spicy for our taste. Also, only gave four starts as mine did not shred very well after cutting into chunks. Probably would have shredded better if I had left the meat whole instead and then shredded at the end.

It was just "ok" to me. It didn't seem to have a lot of flavor (even after the suggested additional green chilies and cumin). It was definitely edible but I probably will not be making it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome! I guess I should state that I made the roast part of the recipe. I had to work late and my husband did not want to create the cilantro-lime rice so he just heated up the long grain and wild rice microwave brand.  Still good, but would have been so much better with the homemade rice. I will definitely be making this again. I did add 1 teaspoon of ground cumin to the roast because I love cumin. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I was happy happy happy with the results!

I love this pork recipe. I was skeptic putting it in the crock pot with so little water but it does end up very tender. I added a half jar of chipotle salsa and some taco sauce. This is a keeper!

I added an onion, more cilantro, cumin, and Adobo seasoning. This is an amazing dish! Very much like Chipotle pulled pork. So good. I couldn't find the Ortega Chipotle, but used Frontera Grill Chipotle sauce in a bag. Fantastic flavor!.

Prep time 15 min? NOT FOR ME! I used a 3# boneless pork SHOULDER roast and it took me over 25 min just to cut into 2" pieces. Maybe because I always trim all the fat off which takes some time. I don't go real fast because my knife is super sharp and I have learned the hard way - so... maybe its 15 min if you don't cut off the fat or if you are quicker than me. Anyway - - very good flavor. Hubby and all 3 sons all gave it 2 thumbs up. My youngest had 3 servings. Next time I will not shred it prior to serving. But I will shred up the leftovers to have pork tacos or burritos later.

Fixed this last night for dinner. It was delicious. I thought the recipe looked interesting as we like Mexican food. It was even better than I thought it would be. The shredded pork was even good with barbecue sauce in a sandwich tonight. We have tried several recipes for cooking a pork roast for shredded pork and this is the best.

Wow, outstanding recipe!  I too could not find chipolte sauce but the chipolte peppers in adobe sauce blended up tasted great.  I think the leftovers would taste great in a stew recipe.

Absolutely loved this receipe.  So so easy to make.  I did use beer instead of water, added diced onion to the chiles, added some powdered lime and added some cumin after I shredded it.  Has just the right amount of kick.

Made this for dinner tonite & it was a super hit!  We made burritos w/the pulled pork instead of having it over rice.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time, I believe I'll add some cumin but that's the only adjustment I'd make.  Very delish!

My family loved this recipe! I used "salsa chipotle" because I could not find regular chipotle sauce. I used 1/2 cup of that and the other ingredients were what the recipe called for. I did not need to add any extra chipotle salsa at the end, or any other spices--it was very tasty as it was. We did not eat it over rice--just used it as taco meat with flour or corn tortillas. It was very tender and had a wonderful taste!!

Made this for Cinco de Mayo, it was so good, everyone loved it even the kids.  I made it exactly as recipe stated, but I used hoagie rolls, I didn't serve it over rice.  Yummo!  Little late in posting review, but I was looking for the recipe to make again!

Very good....I also eyeballed it and added some ground cumin, ground corriander, oregano, garlic powder, and dried cilantro. This added a lot of flavor. Added a can of fire roasted tomatoes too....served on corn tortillas with low fat sour cream and shredded cheddar. Thanks!

This was sooo good!!!  My family totally thought I was the bomb for making it.  ;)

I bought pork shoulder and there was a bone in it so I just put the whole thing in the crock pot without cutting it up.  I couldn't find chipotle sauce but did find chipotle salsa so used that instead I just added like a cup instead of 1/4cup.  I followed the advice of other users and added cumin and chili powder to the meat just for some more flavor. I made the rice but it turned out really bad so just ended up pan frying the pork after it was done to get it kinda crispy and made tacos with it.

I am giving this 5 stars even though the rice was not good due to it's a Mexican shredded pork recipe so forget the rice and just make the pork. :)

This is now in our regular rotation.  We like it with coconut rice, burrito style the best.  We also use half jalapeno and half green chili to make it a bit spicier.

5 stars for ease of preparation and taste.  The meat was not spicy; all the spice was in the sauce, so I took portions out for my kiddos before returning the meat to the sauce for the adults.  It tasted great.  We ate ours Cafe Rio style over the rice with avacado, pico de gallo, more cilantro, and corn.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. After reading other reviews we used beer in place of water, added cumin, and a couple chipotles in adobo. Served on corn tortillas with guac and fresh chopped onions, tomatoes, and cilantro with a spalsh of lime juice. We didn't love the rice, too much lime - may try again though...

To die for!  I followed the recipe almost exactly but I had SUPER hot chipotle sauce so I decided to add 1/2 chipotle and 1/2 adobe sauce (both I had in the refridgerator, am I from Texas or what!).  I also cooked the rice in the rice cooker with the added ingredients and it worked great, my kids were begging me to make more!  Leftovers made great tacos as well.  Thanks!

I just made this for father's day. Everyone LOVED it! We used tortillas instead of the rice, though I can see how the rice would be good too. I could not find the sauce anywhere so I made some from a recipe on this site and it was sooo good!I added a little more of the chipotle sauce b/c we like things spicy.  Even before the added sauce it was a bit soupy- maybe because I doubled the recipe? regardless I'll definately make this again. Even my 3 kids ages 5, 3 and 2 ate them up!

I used the directions/ingredients to make the shredded pork for use in the Baked Chimichangas recipe. Pork was delicious! I used the leftover shredded pork by serving over sauteed polenta. This is a great "go to" recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong but I got a 3lbs of meat and it cooked when I was at work for seven hours and that was way to long I got a mushy mess. I also found it to be a little bland but I could only find chipotle marinade and maybe it is different than chipotle sauce. Probably would have tasted better after 5 hours not 7.

This shredded pork and cilantro-lime rice bowl is heavenly.  I made this for dinner with my boyfriend and he said it was the tastiest thing he has ever eaten.  We added hominy, black beans, homemade salsa, sour cream, low-fat shredded cheddar cheese, and a slice of lime.  We were both sad when we realized our stomaches were too full to eat more!  Can't wait for leftovers.  Thank you Tova for this amazing recipe.

Great recipe! My entire family enjoyed it (3 yr old and 1 yr old!). I was worried about the "heat" so I used about a tsp of pureed chipolte pepper (I keep them preportioned in my freezer). I love cumin so I added that as well as a bit of brown sugar for another layer of flavor. Served with brown rice/lime/cilantro. Topped my rice bowl with sour cream, cheese, corn and avocado. GREAT. Will make again.

My husband was speechless that I can make authentic tasting Mexican dinner at HOME!  I used half the meat since just two of us.  I added a little more salt and we ate it with short grain rice drizzling lime juice over the meat and rice, salad, and a few corn tortillas with cheese.  It was still good.

So yummy!  I skipped the rice but added the cilantro and lime to the meat after I had returned it to the slow cooker.  There was a LOT of liquid left in the slow cooker so I did skim some off so it didn't end up too soupy.  I used the sauce from a can of 7 oz. chipotle peppers packed in adobo sauce (found in the Mexican food section of the grocery store).  I used some of the remaining chipotle peppers to make the Ancho-Chipotle Salsa from this site which was fabulous also!  Used the meat for build your own tacos and it was great!  Leftovers are just as good too!

I'm so glad I came across this recipe. It reminded me of the yucutan pork tacos I enjoyed in Mexico. I loved it so much that the next time I made it I had to find the recipe for pickled red onions. So I could mimic the exact way these tacos were served to us there.

I really wanted to like this but I'm afraid I agree with some of the other reviewers.  It was missing something, mainly flavor.  The recipe overall is a good start but I don't think I'll be making again.

I have used this recipe numerous times for a variety of functions such as a friends' surprise birthday party.  Next up will be for NYE 2009 in which I plan to set this recipe as the centerpiece for a burrito bar.

This was FABULOUS!  I doubled the recipe and instead of doubling the water I added a Bud Light Lime.  Also added a few dashes of Mrs. Dash Southwest Seasoning as others suggested!  Served it up with soft tortillas and all the toppings...everyone liked it a lot!

I added LA hot sauce and used Chipotle enchilada sauce.  It's all I could find in the store, but this turned out very good!

This turned out great.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 since I made some alterations.  First I couldn't find chipolte sauce anywhere, I used whole chipolte peppers in adobo sauce instead.  I also added some orange juice to the slowcooker to counteract some of the spice the whole peppers and adobo sauce were adding.  The rice with lime juice and cilantro however didn't turn out, no flavor for some reason.

Amazing!  So easy.  I made this for my daughter's 21st birthday party and served with spanish rice, refried beans and all the fixings for tacos,tostadas and burritos. It was devoured and I had doubled the recipe!  My husband loves this.

This was sooo good. I had country style boneless pork ribs and a couple pork chops on hand so I just used those and shredded them at at the end. I put together a mix of flour, lil s&p, cumin and chili powder to dredge the pork in, before putting it in the crock pot to thicken up the juices. I added an onion, and instead of water I used beef broth and a couple dashes of worcestershire, along with cumin, chili powder, s&p, and some italian seasoning. Oh and I roasted a pablano and a jalapeno to throw in there with the green chiles. Served in tortillas with shredded cabbage, salsa, sour cream, and cheese... Awesome!

Perfect crock pot meal. As mentioned before, don't add more water than instructed. Used a pork shoulder and cut into 3" cubes before adding to crock pot. I needed a little more salt.

This is absolutely delicious.  Even my 11 year old son loves it.  I have made it several times now serving it over the cilantro and lime rice as well as making burritos out of it.  I even like it by itself in a bowl.  The flavor is so good and there are plenty of juices so you don't have to worry about it being dry.  Awesome receipe!

My husband is from Mexico and is not a fan of Tex-Mex so I looked for a good, authentic pork recipe and came across this one. It was really good!! We loved it-even my 4 year old. I was afraid that it might be too dry and added an additional 1/2 cup of water but shouldn't have. It had plenty of juices once it started cooking. I also added 1/2 tsp of ground cumin. I decided not to add the cilantro and lime to the rice but instead added it to the meat during the last 20 minutes. It was awesome!! Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again!

This is amazing!!  I cooked the roast in the crock pot on low all day (bone in). By the end of the day the meat was so tender and juicy.  My husband and I both loved the flavor.  We used the meat for a couple of different dishes (since it makes plenty for leftovers), and it was great for tacos, nachos, enchiladas, but our favorite was definitely flautas!

I'd really hoped this would be like the pork burrito filling we get from our local Mexican restaurant, but not quite.  Tender, spicy meat.  Could use more salt or other seasoning.

this is great and a recipe you can be creative with as well - I did a pork butt from Costco which shredded nicely - then I made rice and mixed with black beans and used pork, rice mixture, and Jack cheese as a filler for warm tortillas - also used chipotle as a condiment - it was YUMMY ! I forgot the garlic and didn't have chile peppers, but it was still good - next time !

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. I did everything that the orginal recipe included and did not do my own modifications. While it was cooking it smelled so good everyone in the house was looking forward to dinner. Although, when it came time to eat the pork, it was far too bland for all of us. We needed to add quite a bit of hot sauce for it to have a 'mexican' enough flavor. However, the next day, I re-heated the pork and placed it on hoagie rolls with pepper jack cheese and pepperoncini peppers...it was amazing. So I will keep this recipe in my cooking box, just not for the orginal intent.

I didn't love this, but my husband did.  It had a wonderful flavor, but my meat wasn't very tender.  Probably used the wrong cut of pork, plus I cooked it on high instead of low because I was running short on time.  I'll definitely try it again, but the right way.

This is one of the best things I have ever made!  Mine only took 4 hours on low, beware of the timing, for a 3 pound roast.  I seasoned with cumin and minced garlic before putting in the crock pot and added a dried chipotle pepper, delicious!  I served it over brown rice that I seasoned with cumin, garlic and a can of black beans, and lime juice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is good but I could only find chipotle peppers so it was a bit spicy.

I tried again.  This time I found the chipotle sauce.  Big difference, just right this time.  I didn't make the rice but served the pork on fried corn tortillas with guacomole and sour cream.  Very delicious.

Third times a charm!!  OK, I followed recipe exactly & made nachos with the meat!! This is a fabulous meal!  I made fresh nacho chips with corn tortillas, black beans, cheese, & green onions.  I baked in oven for 10-15 minutes, FABULOUS!

This was just the recipe I was looking for. I couldn't find the chipotle sauce(our grocery stores have a limited selection since I live in a small town)so I pureed a small can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. It turned out well but was very spicy. Next time I'll make more of an effort to find the sauce or only use half the can. It made a lot of meat. Plan on freezing the leftovers if you have a small family.

This was an easy five stars.  I had to let it cook a little longer than the seven hours, but that didn't hurt it at all.  The pork was delicious and shredded easily.   We will be making this again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe was good, but definitely not great.  I used chipotle salsa instead of chipotle sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The taste of the meat turned out to be pretty good, but the rice mixed with that much lime juice was terrible.  I ended up tossing the rice and placing the meat inside a tortilla with some cheese and sour cream.  Will probably use this recipe again, but will add more garlic and chilies and definitely serve with tortillas instead of rice.

Loved it.  Was very good we had it in a "bowl" with all the fixings.  I did not make the rice, I made my own version of rice. The only thing I did not have was chipotle sauce, so I added some salsa and some dry chipotle seasoning.  This has already been requested again.

My husband really liked this. It was a bit spicy for me but I added a dallop of sour cream to mine and ate it with tortillas. Then it was fine. The only thing I did different was that I added the cilantro to the meat because we like it. And I made my own spanish rice.

This was just ok for me.  I ended up adding some salsa to the crockpot at the end to make it a little saucier and to give it some more flavor.

This was awesome!  Tender, flavorful and SO easy!  I put the tenderloin into the slow cooker whole (instead of cubing it), and about an hour before it was done, shredded it with a fork and added some more chipotle sauce to make it nice and saucy.  We ate it in tacos w/Mexican rice and beans on the side.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum Yum!  We skipped out on the lime and cilantro on the rice as we don't care for cilantro.  Thanks for the contribution!

We changed some things on this recipe so I will not give it a 5 star rating. But we did add a lot of other spices, cumin, salt, garlic, chopped onion, tapatio and hot wing sauce. It gave it a HUGE kick and we all loved it. We also doubled the batch to make sure we had left overs. This will be made again!

I was really pumped to try this recipe out. I love Mexican food and will do anything for an easy recipe. I didn't have chipotle sauce so I pureed the chipotle peppers with adobo sauce. The meat was tender but didn't have a good taste. My husband and I poured barbeque sauce on the meat and it was okay. UPDATE - we had so much left over that we began to get creative... we mixed in rice, beans, cheese and made it in to a dip.

Very good, I added chopped chipolte peppers (with seeds removed) to add more spice. Will try again with a nice 1 pound pork loin so we don't waste any.

I wasn't nearly as impressed as some of the other reviewers.  We thought this was okay but nothing to write home about.  I doubt I'll make it again.  The meat turned out very dry, and the flavor just wasn't that spectacular.

Followed the recipe exactly it was okay. The meat was tender but lacking something. Will experiment with some additional seasonings next time.

I used 3 lb. of center cut pork chops cubed.  Great flavor!  I felt it could have used an onion chopped in the crock pot.  I omitted the rice and served it like a pork bbq on buns with chipotle sauce on the side to add as needed.

Delicious!! My entire family enjoyed this meal and we will make this again and again. I paired it with the Mexican Sour Cream Rice (from this website) and it was fantastic!

I used a package of chipolte seasoning and it turned out great. I'm not sure where you find Chipolte sauce...but the seasoning packet worked beautifully.

Thanks!

This was very good.  I prepared it all the night before, then turned it on in the morning before work.  I added a chopped onion and about 5 garlic cloves.  I also only put about 3/4 cup of chicken broth, it was plenty.  As it cooked there was more liquid.  At the end I did end up putting in a knorrs tomato chicken bullion.  Next time I may up the chipotle just a bit.  Served it with rice and some pinto beans and some tortillas.  THis will be something I make again for sure.

This is quite tasty.  However, I would suggest trimming off a good bit of the animal fat and adding olive oil.  I felt that the pork fat made the meat kind of gelatinous once it was all shredded up.

Really really Good!  Even my picky 6 year old daughter liked it.

When I first made the rice and tasted it I thought it wasn't very good.  The taste of the lime and cilantro was overpowering.  But when you top it with the shredded pork - WOW!  The combination of all the flavors?  Delicious!

Like another reviewer mentioned I added about 1 1/2 tsp. cumin to the pork before cooking.  Next time I might add a touch more for flavor.  I may also try adding some black beans.

I think this would be equally as delicious made with beef or chicken.

Question...
I don't live in the US anymore and (SO UNFORTUNATELY) had to get rid of my crock pot before we came. No one here has a CLUE what a crock pot is. I tried to slow cook some pork the other day on the lowest setting on the stove top. We went out for a 4 hr bike ride and I came home to a dry, charred, pork tenderloin. (The prices of meat here are unruly! How they sleep at night charging this much for meat is beyond me.) Help? Please?

I followed several of the suggestions from reviews and this recipe was just awesome!  Cooked 10 hours in the crock, drained the juice and skimmed fat.  Pulled pork, and added enough juice to keep it moist.  Didn't have the chipotle sauce, but, found I had a "hot" chipotle flavor hot sauce that I spinkled all over when meat was cooked.  Also added cumin while cooking along with one whole onion, and a can of tomatoes and chili peppers.  Cooked white rice with lime and cilantro, mixed meat in a bowl with rice, sour cream, black beans and guac.  DW "raved" said it was better than Chipotle!

To Nelepope in UK. Cilantro is a green herb that looks like Italian parsley but tastes totally different. (sometimes called coriander) I see Jamie Oliver & Nigella Lawson use it constantly so it's available. You can buy smoked jalapenos in adobo sauce in the can (chipotles) or Tabasco makes a chipotle flavor hot sauce as do many other brands. Chipotle is HOT.

This was delish!!  I did change it quite a bit to fit our tastes, but I'm sure it was great as written too.  I used frozen green chiles (canned one I find to be too mushy), cooked the pork in the slow cooker WITH the lime juice, no rice.  Omitted chipotle sauce I liked the simple clean citrus flavor.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Awesome, have plenty of leftovers and my hubbikins is THRILLED about that.

This is just the best stuff!!  I didn't make the rice since it didn't seem to get rave reviews.  I just made up some basmati rice that we had on hand, and it was yummy!!!  We ate it in tortillas with sour cream and guacamole, I added the leftover meat to the leftover rice and ate it as a rice bowl.  I made this pretty much as written, using Tobasco brand Chipolte Sauce!   YUM YUM YUM!!!

Outstanding recipe. As I sometimes do I tried to make exactly as the recipe calls for so a fair review can be done. I only put in beer instead of water and a little less cilantro. I was very pleased with this recipe.

Great recipe. I stuck it in the crock as noted in other recipes. I did include chicken stock so that the meat wouldnt dry out...this was SUPER TASTY and smelt WONDERFUL. Made even better leftovers!

I was very happy with this receipe.  I could not find the Chipolte Sauce, but made my own and my husband was very happy and so was I.  Will make it again. 
Thanks!

Great recipe. I couldn't find chipotle sauce. McCormick Grill Mates has a chipotle pepper marinade that I used (about 1/2 packet) and mixed in some extra water. I also added some cumin to the pork before shredding it which gave a nice Mexican flavor.

This recipe was so unbelievably good!  We used chipotle salsa and didn't cut up the roast and it still shredded wonderfully.  I've been dying to remake this dish; highly recommended!

I made this receipe for 25 people.  It was absolutely wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy and the chipotle sauce gave it a kick.  I used the Tabasco Chipotle "Smoked" it gave the meat a very woodsy, smoked flavor.  I would definately recommend this dish.

This was very good. I did modify the recipe. Instead of water I used a 12oz. bottle of beer (which was a tip on another review) and I added 1/2 an onion. I also seasoned the meat before I put it in the crock-pot with salt, pepper, the garlic, and Chef Merito Adobo. I cooked the meat for about 4 hours and it shredded perfectly. I served it with corn tortillas, rice, sour cream, and cheese. This was excellent and my husband raved over it!

This was absolutely great.  I could not find chipotle sauce so I used chipotle peppers and cut them up.  It turned out too spicy, so next time I would cut back on the peppers.  The rice was not as great as I thought but the meat was very tasty.

Absolutely fabulous!!  I reduced the cilantro because my husband doesn't like cilantro that much.  We decided needed a bit more.  I will follow recipe to the letter tomorrow when I fix it again.  We ate it with flour tortillas. DELICIOUS!!

Very good! I didn't have chipotle sauce so I had to sub. I think it would be even better with that. I wrapped the rice and pork in a tortilla with cheese, sour cream, and salsa and it was excellent. My husband raved!

This recipe was very good!  I used a slightly larger pork loin roast (about 4 pounds).  Also, I wasn't sure what chipotle sauce was so I bought a can of chipotle peppers and put in about half of it, including one pepper I chopped up.  Looking back, I think they are talking about hot sauce.  Also, I did not try the rice.  It made a lot of meat.  I used 3/4 cup water in the crockpot and it made too much liquid.  Next time I will use less water.  Mine turned out a little bland, but the flavor was better one day later. Overall, will make again.

Pretty good- good flavor. We ate it with beans, guacamole, salsa, etc. The rice included with this recipe was pretty bland though. Next time I will use the recipe but skip the rice and made it with a yellow rice instead.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We used the pork for burritos and added pinto beans, fresh salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Next time I will use a little less lime juice in the rice, though.  It's a keeper!

While this was very simple to prepare, I was a little dissappointed that there wasn't more flavor.  It was good with refried beans and toppings as a burrito, doubt I would make it again without really jazzing it up.  Thanks anyway!

The pork was very good (very tender and flavorful) but the rice turned out really gummy and the lime flavor threw me off a little.  My husband didn't mind it so much.  I could not find chipotle sauce at my grocery store so I just used some Ranchero sauce I happened to have on hand.  I plan to take the leftover meat, make up some fresh rice seasoned with pepper and cilantro, and a can of drained and rinsed black beans and make up wraps using large flour tortillas.  Next time I make this, I will just skip on the rice portion of the recipe.

this was awesome!  I would use a yellow rice next time and I used peach salsa with it which was a nice compliment to the mix.  I did add the whole chipotle and it was too hot!

I added a little chopped onion to this.  When it was cooked and the pork shredded I placed all in a saucepan, added more water and a little cornstarch to thicken.  I serve this over bean/beef burritos with shredded lettuce, Mexican 4 cheese, black olives and chopped tomatoes.  My husband says this is the best burrito sauce ever!

Disappointing.  I loved using the slow cooker and loved the fact that it was almost "fat free", but it was bland and the pork was chewy.  I would give it two stars, but my husband liked it a bit better.  It is expensive to make, so I want to love it.  We did add some taco seasoning when we re-heated.  Will probably try to use some as enchilada filling.  I wonder if meat this lean just doesn't work well in the slow cooker?

This was tasting somewhat bland, so I doctored it up with a little vinegar, brown sugar, and chili sauce. Also, I couldn't find chipotle sauce, so I used my hot sauce from the pantry, instead. Turned out pretty good. The lime juice in the rice gave it a uniqueness, which I believe I'll incorporate in other rice dishes. Very tasty!
