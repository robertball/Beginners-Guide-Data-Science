This got 5 stars from my whole family. We loved it! I used 2 lbs. lamb, 2 lbs. red potatoes, about 7 multicolored organic carrots, 2 c. beef broth, the parsley, salt and black pepper. Eight hours on low in the slow cooker, and I served it with the Light Wheat Rolls from this website that I had frozen from last weekend. Yummy!

I used new potatoes instead of baking and left out the celery and left the recipe with my husband to prepare. Not only was it foolproof to prep and cook, but the flavour of the lamb really came through. 
This is a basic recipe and great - healthy and very good.
Thanks for sharing! My husband insists on making it again (which is fantastic in my books!)

I typically make another lamb stew recipe that has red wine, zucchini, tomatoes, fennel, horseradish and chiles.  This recipe looks very basic next to it so I was a little skeptical that this would be as satisfying.  It was great (the parsley was key for us).  This stew has a short ingredient list, was a snap to prep and has a simple flavor that hits the spot.  It's a great one to make ahead as the flavor is better the next day.  Now I have two great lamb stew recipes!

My husband likes to go to the farmer's market on Saturday mornings and he's always bringing home something out of the ordinary.  This time it was lamb stew meat.  I was never exposed to any kind of meat except beef, chicken and pork when I was growing up and never learned how to prepare other meats so I was very glad to find this recipe on the site.  It was very easy to prepare with basic ingredients I already had on hand and has a nice flavor.  I've made it twice now exactly by the recipe and it turned out perfect both times.

This was my first attempt at making lamb stew. I followed the advice of others and used new potatoes and cooked it in the crock pot all day. Paired with the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread, it was a wonderful meal.

This is the very best stew! It is so good! It is a perfect marriage of flavors and the lamb is so tender and the flavor is so mild, everything is perfection! This will make you feel all warm and fuzzy. A must try!!

I tried this recipe for an Irish themed party and everyone liked it.  I thought the lamb flavor in it was really strong though and kind of overpowers the other flavors in the stew.  So if you really enjoy that flavor then this is perfect.

This was a big hit at a recent party.  The only change I would make would be to thicken the broth.

Delicious!  Used leftover leg of lamb from Easter Dinner.   Followed the recipe with a little extra seasoning... pressed garlic and rosemary.  Also added some cornstarch to the beef broth as another review had suggested.

This is a delicious stew. I bought lamb cubes at the local farm market, and removed much of the fat before preparing the stew. I sauteed the lamb cubes for a few minutes just to brown, then prepared the recipe as indicated (without the celery and parsley - didn't have either), and put all ingredients in a crock pot to cook for 8 hours on low. An hour before serving I made a slurry of flour and water, and stirred it into the juice of the stew, re-covered the pot and let it thicken slightly. YUM!

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful.  My husband's mom used to make this when he was growing up and he loved it.  He said it was the same thing and it was all gone.  Thank you for a great recipe

I used pork instead of lamb. I wasn't crazy about the meat- the beef broth made me crave beef instead of a lighter meat. The juices and the veggies came out great though!

I love lamb stew and this was a lot like the one I was raised with but not quite.  My mother is Greek and they make one I likebetter. Add some tomato and artichokes to it.  Don't forget the oregano, garlic and lemon juice of course if you go the Greek style.

This is simple and WONDERFUL just as it is!  I made sure to cook it with the bones and just removed them before I served it to make for a full flavored, protein packed stew.  Tasty and tender.  Can't wait to make it again.  I won't change a single thing.

Sorry but this lacked flavour even with the additions I made below. I recommend only using 13 ounces of broth & even more spices then I used. I won't be making this again as I prefer my Old Fashioned Beef Stew from Better Homes & Gardens. Here's what I did: I used lamb shoulder in 2" cubes, which was very tender. I increased the carrots to 2 & 1/2 & added 1 parsnip. I used 1/2 of a large onion (6 ounced diced) in addition to the sauteed onion below. I added 1/2 teaspoon dry rosemary, 1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning, more salt & fresh ground pepper.   In dutch oven, I sauteed 1/2 of a large onion (6 ounces chopped) in 1/2 tablespoon each of butter & olive oil over med. heat, till translucent. I then added 3/4 teaspoon chopped garlic from jar & sauted it just until garlic started to smell. I added the lamb & browned it for 3 minutes.  15 minutes before serving, I removed ½ cup of broth & mixed with 2 tablespoons cornstarch, to make gravy.

Thought it was a bit boring the first time.  Did some adjustment the 2nd time. Used red small potaoes (whole). Dredged the lamb cubes in flour, salt and pepper and browned in Canola oil in the bottom of the cast iron casserole. Added 1 tsp thyme, 2 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  To the beef broth I added 1 tbl of tomato paste and the rest of the flour and salt and fresh ground pepper from the dredged lamb cubes.  30 minutes before finished I added 2 cups of baby bella mushrooms (sliced) and the fresh parsley and a can of dark beer.  Removed the lid for 15 minutes in the oven to thicken the sauce.

This recipe is fantastic. Simple ingredients, low sodium, stores well, and absolutely delicious. I'd love to see a slow-cooker variant of this recipe.

This recipe seemed too simple to be good, but I gave it a chance.  Glad I did!  Really bright, clean flavors - the parsley and black pepper give it the perfect amount of spice.  Served with crispy bread to dip in the broth.  Will definitely make again and again!

This stew is solid fare and so stupid-easy to make! I baked it the two hours and then for another 45 minutes because while the potatoes were cooked through the onions weren't wilted enough.  Suggestions and modifications: I halved the potato and doubled the carrots, and added an extra stalk of celery (three for a doubled recipe).  Even with those proportions it has plenty of potato.  My only suggestion is not to go easy on the salt or pepper - perhaps because I used low-sodium broth but I needed a lot of both spices to make up for it - also a bit of extra parsley and some white pepper didn't hurt.  Love that you just add each item as you chop it into the pan - no prep bowls needed!

WOW!  I grabbed this recipe just trying to mix up my usual routine.  Figured lamb would be a nice switch.  I put it in the crockpot and headed to work.  My husband sent me a text:  "stew's AWESOME!".  My daughter and her friend asked for seconds!  I had mine after work and the lamb was so tender and yummy!!!!!  Two thumbs up:)

The only thing missing is the garlic-at least 2-3 cloves (or more, depending on size of cloves).Garlic is essential to any lamb dish. Otherwise this is a perfect lamb stew.

This turned out well - the only change was that I used a lamb stock cube not beef and I did render off some of the fat before placing in the crock pot. Would make this again.

Absolutely delicious. As I read in other reviews, I added some rosemary. Actually, I accidentally dumped quite a bit in there. It was SUPER strong. Next time I will pinch it! But this recipe is great and I will definitely make again!

Made this recipe in the crock pot and it turned out amazing..... My whole family  loved it! I cooked it on high for 6 hours. The meat was insanely tender and so good!! Great recipe for a first timer of making lamb!

Nice and easy. I would add an extra 1/2 lb of lamb stew meat next time, as it was just enough for 4 smallish appetites, and there was a lot of liquid as well. I added some dried dill and rosemary, but agree with other reviewers that the fresh parsley is a must. I also substituted 1/2 cup of beef broth with 1/2 cup of Guiness stout. I would also add extra carrot as one was not enough. We ate this with Colcannon and Irish soda bread for St. Patrick's Day. Yummy.

I found this to be a little flat on flavor for my taste. A good base recipe, I think. But I ended up adding a little of this and a little of that to make it to my liking.

Great stew.  Instead of salt and pepper, I substituted Montreal Steak seasoning.  Just a warning for hungry tummies-as this stew cooks, your home will smell heavenly!!!

I made this with leftover lamb meat. It was an easy, tasty way to use the leftover, that wouldn't make it tough. I was working that day, so I just prepped the stew and had a family member put it in the oven for two hours. Served up with some crusty rolls, it made for a nice simple winter meal. It was almost all gone before I even got any!

Because other reviewers found this bland, I added caraway seeds, celery salt, and extra parsley and carrots. It was good though not phenomenal. It is easy.

It turned out really well.  I added a rutabaga and three carrots instead of only one.  I skipped the celery.  I also added a pinch of caraway and celery seeds. I let the lamb marinate with about a Tbsp olive oil, two sprigs rosemary, and two cloves garlic.

Very tasty! I took folks' advice and threw in some rosemary, didn't salt every layer, and thickened the broth with some cornstarch before throwing it in.

My family loved it! Followed the recipe - doubled the ingredients- left out the celery and added some garlic cloves. Prepared in the morning - covered and places in fridge. My 15 year old added the broth and popped it into the oven after he got home from school. We arrived an hour and half later - to a divine smelling home!!

I adapted it since we do not eat wheat flour.  I tried the coconut flower and almond flower, but they just don't have the right texture or reaction, so I ended up using a package of sausage gravy as the thickener, which I added at the end of the cooking cycle.
We do not eat carrots either, curving more towards the Keto lifestyle (yes,  I know that the sausage gravy blew that right out of the water, but you use what you have, and we just don't buy carrots.)  I subbed in Cauliflower instead, and it turned out great.

The stew was delicious.  I dusted the lambing flour, salt and pepper, then browned it for a richer taste.  Very good considering the ease of the slow cooker.

The flavors were delicious.  I bought lamb shoulder stew meat but it had too much fat and bones.  Next time I will buy will buy a boneless leg of lamb and cube it.

This is pretty much how I’ve always made it, but it leaves out a main ingredient - diced tomatoes. They let you taste the lamb and still cut that gamy, greasy taste.  Some garlic is nice too!

There are two changes I made to this dish. First  and  biggest  difference, I made this in my slow cooker.  So I warmed up my cooker, used a liner, and layered in the lamb cubed up, salted, peppered and I added rosemary. Then the onion, potato, celery, carrot. Occasionally  stopping to add salt  and pepper. Last step was to add the broth, then cover and leave for about 4 hours before checking and stirring. Added a bit more  broth turned up heat for two hours.  In the end, it was excellent with some crusty bread. Husband loved it. My dad was happy with it too!

We brown the lamb first in a little olive oil and bacon fat with garlic.  We use quartered Yukon Golds instead of russets.  We add a small can's worth of tomato paste as well before we put in the oven.  Family favorite. Even better if you cook it, refrigerator, take off extra fat, and serve the next night.

I didn't have any lamb so I substituted sweet Italian sausage which I browned in the bottom of the soup pot with the onions and some bacon fat.  I drizzled in some red wine to deglaze the pot.   I sliced the par-cooked sausage into coins about 1/2" thick.  I cut the vegetables large and used vegetable stock seasoned with salt, pepper and  Sazon' Achote Cilantro Seasoning.  The broth needed some acidity so I splashed in a little red wine vinegar.  I covered the pot and it all went into the 325 degree preheated oven for only about an hour because the pot was also already preheated.  The meal was very easy to prepare and very flavorful.  I sliced a loaf of Artisan Bread for dipping in the broth and poured a glass of Merlot.  The best lamb stew I ever had.

Good basic recipe: Want to make it GREAT?? Sear the meat first, add 16oz of stout, and season with tsp of rosemary.
That'll do 'er!

Good to start with,but something was missing: tomato paste! Once that was added (3 Tbl.), yumbilicious! Also, I added 6 more carrots and some frozen peas (at the end).

The watery broth was bland, the cooking time was wrong, and the potatoes came out hard and raw.

I made it with a few changes: I used leftover lamb which I added in the last ten minutes, I thickened the stew with two tablespoons of corn starch, and finally, I served it with a big tablespoon of mint chutney.  I will make it again, it is absolutely delicious!

Great recipe. Simple and delicious. We added Rosemary and thyme for some extra flavor. It's a family favorite and perfect dish for winter and fall!
