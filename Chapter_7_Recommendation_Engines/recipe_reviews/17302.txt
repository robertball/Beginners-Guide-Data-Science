I did not care for this recipe at all.  The gel had a strange texture, it looked very unappetizing.  Probably would have been better to pour the filling into the pie shell while it was warm, not hot, and chilled in the pie shell instead of in the bowl.  I ended up having to bake it to salvage it.

The best blueberry pie ever! I used three pints of blueberries so the pie was piled very high and held together even after it was cut. The ratio of sweet to tart was just perfect. This is definitely a keeper!

Very good pie and fresh tasting.   We do not like the mushy taste of blueberries that are baked.  Unfortunately the picture is misleading because it shows a top crust and I originally thought it was going to be baked.   Am sure other noticed this too.

This is the BEST blueberry pie recipe I have ever tried.  We used berries my Dad picked in Michigan's U.P. and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon (couldn't imagine not putting that in LOL)  Wonderful!

A great recipe!  I used Grand Marnier for the orange liquer, which was a bit strong at 1.5 tablespoons.  Next time, I'll reduce to 1 tablespoon.

Also, for the kids' pie I used 1.5 tablespoons of fresh squeezed orange juice.  Still wonderful!

This is a very easy and delicious filling for pie!  Instead of the regular sugar I substituted SPLENDA and it worked perfectly.  I also used a NILLA vanilla waffer ready crust and the sweet tart ratio was wonderful. Topped with a light whipped topping it's the perfect summer treat!

Great filling.  Easy to make and I used it for a filling between cake layers instead of pie.  Great summer dessert and easy!

made this for my dad for father's day. I used Graham cracker crust and added another pint of fresh blueberries on top with honey then used my torch to brulee them.
