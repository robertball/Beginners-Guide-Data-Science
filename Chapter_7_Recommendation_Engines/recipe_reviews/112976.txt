Like others, I wasn't too sure about the butterscotch and pumpkin combo. I made half with, and half without the chips - by FAR the muffins with the butterscotch chips were the hit!
The butterscotch flavor pairs perfectly with the spices and makes for a totally fantastic taste experience...you'll definitely want to give this recipe a try!

I made no changes to this recipe.

These came out great! I've got a Girls Night Out tonight so I made these today for tomorrow's breakfast. (Never know how hungover you'll be the next day.) Simple enough to throw together. I did have full-sized and the other half mini-sized, for the kids. These are very good and great for rainy Sunday mornings.

I bought a large can of pumpkin, which I only needed a third of. I froze the rest in one-cup servings, so I can just thaw out the pumpkin and make these again.

For those of you who worry about the chips sinking to the bottom and burning, toss them in a bit of the dry ingredients, then fold into the muffin batter. No sinking here!

Great combination of flavor! One note after making two very different batches: packing down the brown sugar results in shorter, more dense muffins, while not packing it down (less brown sugar) gives fluffier, cake-like muffins. Great recipe as is.

MMMM, Mommy, you have to make these again!  That's the quote I got from my 7 year old.  I altered the recipe to make it a little more healthy - white whole wheat flour, 3/4 cups brown sugar - no white sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce - even so, the muffins were wonderful and the butterscotch was a nice companion to the pumpkin.

These came out wonderfully, and were gone in no time.  A new record.
I didn't have butterscoth chips so I subsituted them with 6oz of caramel topping, and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I also used pumpkin puree instead of canned.  This is a great recipe.

OH MY GAWD ..these are great!! We're not big butterscotch fans, but when they're combined with the right flavors as they are here... you've got yourself a winner.  Plus they look so cute that it's a classy take-to for get-togethers.  My recommendation is to fill them right about to the top so you have a nice muffin top instead of a flat muffin. :)

These are SOOO good! I made the recipe exactly as written. My husband isn't usually a fan of baked goods and even he is addicted. They disappeared immediately. AWESOME recipe!!!

These were really great!  Everybody in the office loved them.  I added some cloves and allspice to the recipe and increased the ginger and cinnamon for personal taste as I like things spicy!  Thanks for the great recipe.

My kids love pumpkin and butterscotch chips but the flavor TOGETHER was just odd.  I halved the recipe and got 19 mini muffins.  Although the muffins were moist, some were too sweet and others were bland.  This is caused by the unequal distribution of the butterscotch chips in each muffin.  My kids will probably eat all of them because of the amount of sugar in the recipe, but I don't think I will make again.  Also, make sure you remove from the pan about 5 minutes after removing from the oven to reduce the "sticking" of the melted chips that attach to the inside of the muffin cups.

EXCELLENT!  I don't like pumpkin flavored anything, but I wanted to give this a try with all the reviews.  So glad I did.  Next time I have to do morning snacks at church, I will be taking this along.  I already have a slam dunk snack from allrecipes - Mandarin Orange Bites - that everyone salivated over.  Now I have another.  These are so very good. WOW!!  I was NOT expecting such flavor depth.

Delightful! We made them into normal sized muffins, because we only have that size of pan, so if that's the case, cook them for ~10 minutes longer.

This is so great! For presentation I put 2-3 butterscotch chips on top. Someone else also suggested that you don't wait to long to pull them out of the pan or the butterscotch will start to melt to the pan and make it really messy. This was a great tip!

These were FANTASTIC!  They were so moist!  My husband's eyes popped out of his head when he had his first bite - he loves pumpkin anything - but he especially liked these!  Super easy recipe as well - and the consistency of the batter made them really easy to portion out.  Excellent recipe!   ***Just realized, like another reviewer, I too added the whole can of pumpkin, but obviously it didn't make much difference to us!

I was BORED...bored, bored, bored...wanted to make something...I had some pumpkin in the fridge and some butterscotch morsels in the freezer...umm...sounded like an odd combo...but went for it!  YUMMY!!  Hey, these are really good, and they came out PERFECT which is different for my muffins, appearance wise, but very tasty. Even the guys loved them. I think I might even make these again someday! lol  I used Crisco oil in place of the butter, obviously that was ok. Thanks!!

Yum!  I was a little unsure, like others on here, about the combination of pumpkin and butterscotch, but they are great!  Turned out perfectly!  We made a double batch and took them to church - everyone loved them!

Just finished making these, they are delicious.  I am definitely making these when we have family here for the holidays.  I think the kids will love them.    The only change I may make is to add some pecans next time.  Muffins just aren't right without nuts to me.

Found this recipe today and decided to give it a try. I have to say that while I orginally thought that pumpkin and butterscotch were an odd combination, these are incredibly tasty and were very well received. I made no changes to the recipe and they were perfect. Thanks Megan for an exceptional muffin recipe.

These muffins are delicious! I've heard nothing but praise about these muffins. I saved some butterscotch chips and pushed them into the top of the muffin mix after I poured them out and they looked much more appealing. Definitely will make again!

Insanely Delicious.  They're really tender but crunch on the top, and don't stick to the muffin paper.  I added 1/2 t. real vanilla extract just to prevent that "soapy" homemade muffin flavor, and it was great!  (I don't think all people are sensitive to this flavor, but hey, humor me!)

I was a little skeptical at the thought of combining butterscotch chips & pumpkin but I made them for a dinner with my co-workers and they couldn't stop raving how delightful these were! Take a chance & make these!

These were good but WAY too sweet and rich for my family.  Most of them went uneaten because it was like eating candy!  Also, be VERY careful and don't use too many butterscotch chips.  They melted and caused the muffins to stick in the muffin tray, making it very difficult to remove the muffins.

Fantastic!  What a great fall recipe.  I did use pumpkin pie spice and due to a senior moment (you can have those at 45, right?) I grabbed peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch but we still enjoyed.  I did add some butterscotch chips after I saw the error of my ways.  These were quick and easy to make, even with my three year old grandson helping (give me strength).  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe collection.

Wow...definitely five plus stars! I made them for some girlfriends today and they got inhaled - so addictive! Tried coating the chips in the dry mixture, but that didn't keep mine from sticking/sinking somewhat (didn't detract from how much we loved them!)Made a second batch later in the day, and - not sure if it was one of these tricks or a combination of both - but the chips didn't stick as much, and the end result looked a bit prettier (lighter in color, chips stayed on top.) I popped the b'scotch chips in the freezer while prepping the rest, and when it came time to put into the muffin tin, I layered: small bit of batter, few chips, bit of batter, few chips pushed slightly into the top, then baked. The chips didn't melt as much, keeping their shape better.I'm going to stock up on butterscotch chips asap!

NO MODIFICATIONS NEEDED!   This recipe is PERFECT!  I have made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks....perfect every time....exactly 48 mini muffins.  I've used both the butterscotch chips and chocolate ones.  Delicious both ways!  FINALLY A RECIPE that doesn't need you to read everyone else's reviews to get the best version.  THANK YOU!!!

I've made this recipe many times over the last three years for friends, family and coworkers, and they are always a huge hit. I've impressed people who don't like pumpkin, as well as people who don't like food made by other people. I am now expected to make these for the family at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Though I have made them as mini muffins, they're a huge hit as regular-sized muffins.

I was very please with these muffins.  They were incredibly moist which is not always the case with mini muffins.  I love the pumpkin & butterscotch combination.  I will make these again & again.

These are amazing! I used salt-free Becel and splenda sugar and added just a touch more pumpkin. I made 6 jumbo muffins and cooked them about 20 minutes and they are perfect - great texture and just a touch of decadence with the butterscoth chips while still tasting the pumpkin. Will definitely make these again!

These muffins are DEEEELICIOUS.  This is a sweet and moist muffin - very cake-like.  The butterscotch chips really make it sweet and decadent.  The butterscotch and pumpkin flavors go really well together.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I made them  as listed in recipe, but used fresh grated ginger instead of ground, and I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.   I thought the batter was just a little too thick/dry, so I added a little apple juice to bring it together.  They were extremely moist and came out of the pan so easily!!!  Huge hit with the adults and kids!  They were great as an after-dinner accompaniment to coffee!  Will definitely make these again and again!  Thanks for such a wonderful, easy recipe!!!

What a delicious change!  I make a lot of muffins, and this will be a new favorite.  I made them in regular-sized muffin tins, filled to the top, topped with chopped pecans, and baked for 22 minutes.  Divine!

Okay, so I accidentally read the directions wrong and added an entire can of pumpkin. BUT, these were such a hit, so moist and butterscotchy sweet, absolutely declicious.  Oh, and I did put an entire bag of the butterscotch too, that was definitely NOT a mistake, lol, love them!

I had high hopes for these cupcakes, unfortunately I was disappointed. The flavor was ok but the batter was a mess. Just a heads up for everyone else, whatever the muffins look like when you put them in the muffin tin is what they will look like when you take them out of the oven. They aren't like normal muffins where the batter bakes up into a nice muffin shape. I like the idea of pumpkin muffins with butterscotch chips so I may try adding them to my regular pumpkin muffin recipe.

These are great!  My kids won't stop eating them and asking for more!  The mini muffin size make it like a little soft cookie treat instead of a muffin.  I added 2-3 butterscotch chips to the top of each muffin before baking to make the tops pretty.  Yummy!!! Don't change anything!

These have an amazing flavor.  Unfortunately, they do not hold together.  I had to bake them almost twice as long as the recipe called for, and then, they fell apart when I tried to pull them out of the pan.  Even leaving them in the pan to cool a bit didn't help.  I could blame it on the size, but I made them half mini muffins and half regular size.  Even with a bigger size, they still fell apart.  Next time, I'm going to add the spices/butterscotch chips to another pumpkin muffin recipe.

I followed the recipe to a T. I used a stand mixer with the whipping attachment to sift and then added the wet ingredients and the chips using that attachment. 10 min is all it took for me and they came out perfect!!!!

Delicious! Very easy to make with few changes (used more morsels and no white sugar - used 3/4 packed brown sugar). Was a hit with the whole family. Will definitely be making this again and again!

These were deliciouse! But mine didn't want to come out of the muffin tins--especially when there were butterscotch chips on the bottom. I'll use paper liners instead of cooking spray next time.

Followed this recipe exactly. First batch i made whith butterscotch second with chocolate chips. Both were delicious. But something was missing from these muffins though thats why i gave 4 stars. They just werent moist enough. Next time maybe i will add apple sauce or something to make up for the slight dryness.

just finished baking these and they are pretty good.maybe they could use a bit more of spice  or sugar but over all good.i did not have butterscotch so i added walnuts for that nice crunchy texture. i did have to bake then a min or two  longer so they dont stay gooey in the middle. great recipe!

Best muffins I've ever made by far. Have made them well over a dozen times. Only changes I sometimes make is using some whole wheat flour or throwing some flax seed meal in the batter. Changes aren't needed though!!

These are INCREDIBLE!  Love them.  I baked them for 11 1/2 minutes then let them cool for about 5 minutes before removing them from the pan.  I've never enjoyed butterscotch so much as with the pumpkin in this recipe!

Delicious - even friends who don't normally like butterscotch loved these.  The first time I made them I was short on pumpkin (only about 3/4 cup) so I subbed applesauce for the other 1/4 cup - came out great.  Second time I used all pumpkin. I also omitted ginger from these both times because I didn't have it. My 2 and 5 year olds both love these.

These were the best pumpkin muffins that I have made. I only used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. splenda. I used 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. applesauce instead of butter. The batter is very thick. I may had some liquid the next time.

Yummy!  I think they are good as mini muffins cause they are somewhat rich with the butterscotch chips.  I subbed vegetable oil for the melted butter.  I just didn't want to add a whole stick of butter to the mix.  Great little snacks for the kids.

These are really good. I did omit 1/2 of the white sugar because I don't like things to sweet and the butterscotch chips are already sweet.  yummy!

These are excellent, I didn't change anything, they were moist and perfect.  I did take a hint from someone else and added the butterscotch chips to the dry to make them not sink to the bottom.  The flavors really mesh well together, I will definately be making these again!

I just received a silicone mini muffin pan for Christmas.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  The muffins were very tasty but I found I had to cook them for at least 15 min.  Maybe because it was silicone?

Amazing!! I took these to 3 separate events over the last 2 weeks and every time they were a HUGE hit. Really good fresh out of the oven and even reheated for that warm soft muffin tastiness. For an extra decadent experience, smear a little cream cheese on them :)

I followed the recipe exactly. After 12 minutes they weren't done. I checked them every few minutes and took them out after 25 since they were done on the outside but they were half cooked inside. Don't know what went wrong; I have a thermometer so

Made a few changes to try to make it healthier - used honey instead of white sugar, oil instead of butter, doubled the pumpkin, added 1/2 cup of ground walnuts & 1/2 cup of wheat germ, and used 3-4 tsp pumpkin pie spice & extra cinnamon instead of the separate spices.  Kids LOVE them!

These are fantastic.  My family loves these.  I always double the recipe and use the batter to make muffin tops.  I add pecans and used freshly ground nutmeg.  If you've never ground your own nutmeg it tastes much better, a little citrusy almost.  I took some into work and my colleagues told me several times how tasty they were.

Great recipe I use it often my husband loves these muffins. I recently started subing half the flour for vanilla protein powder and splenda for sugar, turns out with great flavor and it's a little more healthy!

Yummy! These were fabulous. My daughter wanted to make some "teeny" things and I had some pumpkin I wanted to use so we picked this recipe. They taste great the same day but the taste better the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins are ridiculous.  They are so addictive.  I just made a batch and I've eaten 4 already.  They are super sweet - if you want them to be less sweet maybe you could put in a bit less of the butterscotch chips.  I put in more, which was probably not the best idea.  Also, I filled the pan a bit too much and had to cook mine for 15 minutes.

These muffins are one of the best pumpkin ones I have tasted!! Made just as the recipe called for except substituted coconut oil for half of the butter!  I am not fond of butterscotch but loved the taste mixed with the pumpkin!!  Will definitely make these again!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!  My kids loved them too!

I made these for my 3 year old's preschool class for their Thanksgiving Feast and they loved them.  They freeze well too.  I made extra and froze them for an easy snack for my toddler.  My husband told me "I don't like butterscotch chips but these are good!"

WOW! WOW! WOW! Can you tell we loved them? Everyone thought these were absolutely amazing and I've shared the recipe twice already. The pumpkin, butterscotch, and spice flavors blend so harmoniously that these muffins are like little bites of heaven. I highly recommend you try this recipe.

Not bad.  These are really sweet from the butterscotch, but I agree that pumpkin and butterscotch go well together.  I'm glad there's only a bit of butterscotch in this, though!  Very easy to make, and I used my small cookie scoop like anohter reviewer to get the perfect amount into the mini cupcake liners.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! Bakery quality! I followed the recipe exactly except used white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch because I didn't have any on hand! These muffins came out so moist and fluffy and DELICIOUS I can hardly believe I made them. I used all fresh, quality ingredients (other than the pumpkin, which was canned, but organic!) and find that it really makes a difference in my baking.

i give it 5 stars because they came out AMAZING, but i did have to change a couple of things. i didnt have butter so i used 1/4 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup oil in its place and i dont have mini muffin tins so it made about 18 regular sized muffins and i baked them for 20 minutes. i was doubtful of the butterscotch/pumpkin combo but they are delicious and will definitely be a new regular in my house! thanks for a great recipe.

Let me just say, these are amazing! The only issue I had was the chips sticking to the pan. I should have let them cool a little bit longer before taking them out of the pan, but I just could not wait!!! The smell of these baking filled the whole house with yummy smells!!!!!!! One the second batch that I made I ran out of pumpkin, so I used sour cream to make up the difference (about 1 tbsp) and they were even better, if that is possible!

Surprisingly yummy. I had no idea what to do with some butterscotch chips and this ended up being the perfect way to use them. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and it baked up two muffin pans full of muffins!  I followed the advice about adding the chips with the dry ingredients, they turned out great.  Delicious with vanilla ice cream.

My only changes were dry whisking first step because I didn't have a sifter.  Also replaced butterscotch with mini chocolate chips. I really liked it. Mine did take ten extra minutes to bake though.

Insanely good. I added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp ground cloves and followed the suggestion of another reviewer.... I added the chips to the dry mix and then folded the dry mix into the wet to keep the chips from sinking to the bottom.  I sprayed my muffin tin with Pam and removed to cool after 5 minutes.  They didn't stick and aren't falling apart like other reviewers did. Perfect, actually.  I added two chips to each muffin before baking for decoration.

I am not a baker so anytime I bake something, it's a  shoot. However, I was so pleased that these turned out so great. I baked 5 dozen for my son's bday party and all the kids [and mommies] loved them!! 

What I'd like to do moving forward tho is figure out how to get the chips on top - so cute. Mine were all in the muffin. No one cared and they were gone in three hours!

These were great!  I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, replaced 1/2 sugar with Stevia and added a tad of baking powder/soda (as recommended on the Stevia bag).  They came out great and will hopefully be a hit for snack time @ Kindergarten!  Great for Thanksgiving week @ school!

Love these!  I had just enough pumpkin for half a batch and they turned out incredible.  They were so good fresh from the oven, the nutmeg and butterscotch flavors wonderfully mingling together.  I love nutmeg and will probably add more next time, seeing how well it goes with butterscotch.  My only difficulty was in getting these out of the pan.  In my haste to try one, I tried removing before they were cool and some of them stuck to the pan.  So do be sure to grease your pans well and let them cool before turning out.  I found that it helped to give them a little twist before lifting the muffin out.

No need to grease the pan!  With a stick of butter, they popped out just fine without it.  I used a medium cookie scoop to measure out batter and came out with 24 really gorgeous mini muffins and 3 regular sized ones.  We didn't have enough butterscotch chips, so used 1/2 butterscotch and 1/2 chocolate (my kids weren't going to complain!), but I want to try all butterscotch next time.  Used 1 c bread flour and 3/4 c whole wheat.  My oven runs very cool, but using the convection setting, they cooked perfectly in 12 minutes at 350.  These would make great gifts-- pretty and tasty!

I was skeptical but made this recipe for my boyfriend and son.  They LOVED it!! I took some to work and 7/8 of the people I work with went nuts for them.  1 doesn't like butterscotch.  My boyfriend and son both say this recipe is a KEEPER!!! I usually don't like muffins but I really loved this one!!!

I loved the flavor of these, but I could not get them to release from the muffin tins I did try cup liners, but the cooked muffin would not come out of liners without leaving lots of muffin behind.

Received lots of compliments on this! I made full size muffins and didn't have any ginger to use, but we honestly didn't miss it. I think I might try adding nuts to part of the next batch. This made appx. 12 regular size muffins when I filled the muffin tin a little over 3/4 full. I did end up cooking them appx. 10 minutes more, as one reviewer suggested.

These are good.  I used 2 teas. of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the others.  I thought the butterscotch chips went well, it is just the kids don't prefer the flavor and asked me to use chocolate chips next time. I did not get 48 mini muffins out of my muffin pan, rather only about 30.

Even my husband like these and he's not a fan of butterscotch.  They were a little sweet to serve as a breakfast food, but were perfect for an afternoon snack.

This recipe was very good! I made the standard size muffins instead which led me to double the recipe to make an average amount of muffins. To cook, it took about 15-20 minutes TOTAL time. My family loved them. Definitely a recipe to make again in the near future!

Not sure how these are going to turn out…I followed the recipe to a T (minus a bit of sugar and substituting a bit of whole wheat pastry flour)…but they essentially dropped into my pan in a lump. I was not able to "pour" them into the muffin tins. Is it normal to mix the sugar with the dry ingredients? I usually combine that with the wet ingredients. I am wondering if this would make a difference? I do love the combination of pumpkin and butterscotch, so I'm hopeful!

I wanted to like this so badly because they have a wonderful presentation, easy to make and smell wonderful baking.  I think for me it is the butterscotch with the pumpkin that just doesn't work for me.  So sorry.

Not the nicest and most professional looking muffins but these really had quite a nice taste.  I followed the recipe exactly other than to double the amount of cinnamon. This recipe made 18 regular sized muffins.  I cooked these for 20-25 minutes.

They turned out wonderfully! The only change that I made was that I cut the amount of butterscotch chips in half and sprinkled some skor bits on top the of muffins prior to baking.
Turned out perfectly moist and flavourful!
Will definitely make these again!

I loved this receipe, I made it just the way the recipe was written except I added chopped walnuts. I took these to work and got rave reviews. I did have to bake longer than 12 minutes, but they turned out great. Even the men at worked couldn't get enough. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were fantastic as is. I made full size muffins, it took about 15 minutes longer.  These were the best pumpkin muffins we have ever tried. The husband and kids absolutely loved them.

These were wonderful!!  I didn't have the exact measurements of spices as called for in the recipe, i.e. I had no ginger so I did 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp all spice and they had really good flavor.  The butterscotch flavoring is great!  I wouldn't have thought to put the two together but these were definitely a hit with the family!

Yummo!!! I made these last night and they are almost gone! I only substituted applesauce for the butter, egg beaters for the eggs & used half all purpose flour with half wheat flour. I did make regular size muffins instead. I made half of them with butterscotch chips for my husband and half with raisins for my daughter. The ones with butterscotch chips were amazing!!! I can't wait to make these again! Thanks Megan for an awesome recipe!

These were very very sweet and I only used 3/4 of the chips called for.  Need more cinnamon too.  However the kids and husband did really like them, maybe they have more of a sweet tooth than I....

After I started I noticed I didn't have the nutmeg or ginger on hand.  I pressed on and the muffins turned out just fine without (however, probably would have been even better with).  Not a single muffin left on the plate at Bible study.  Will make again!

Let's keep this short and sweet- this recipe works like a charm if you use mini foil tins (hard to find at stores sometimes so I buy mine from Amazon.com) and pair it with Trader Joe's pumpkin ice cream =)

These are wonderful! I only had pumpkin pie filling, so I cut back on both sugars by half & I used 1/8 tsp salt. (Since it already has sugar, spices, & salt in it.I did add the cinnamon still.) I can't wait to make them again!

Just made these and the kids LOVE them (8, 6 & 4). My 6 year old said, "When I grow up, will you give me the recipe so I can make these for my kids?" Made them as the recipe said, but added a Tablespoon of lecithin and chia seeds for some added nutrition. Next time I make these, I will add a dollup of yogurt to the batter.

My husband couldn't stop eating them and said they were the best muffins he has ever had... which was a big shock. Loved the pumpkin/butterscotch combination. They were all gone in a day - all 48 of them!!

Love this recipe. I didn't have a mini muffin tray so I used a standard size instead. It made about 16 muffins. I baked them for about 15 minutes ... but I kept a close eye on them. Also, I added in dark chocolate chips. I brought them to a party last weekend and they were gone in an hour! Can't wait to make these again tomorrow.

Absolutely mouth watering, they were gone by the end of the day!  I just added a little molasses for moisture.  So good!

these were amazing, and Im not even a big pumpkin fan.  Pumpkin and butterscotch are a great duo.  I made exactly as recipe stated.

OMGosh!!!  These are excellent!  Since my husband is diabetic, I used Splenda instead of sugar, and Splenda brown sugar blend.  I made one dozen regular sized muffins...baked them for 25 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yum these are so good.  I made regular sized muffins instead of minis.  One thing i hated ws that the buterscotch chips oozed out of the muffins, but they were still good.

I don't like the butterscotch with the pumpkin flavor.  If the butterscotch chips are removed from the recipe these are definately 5 stars.  The flavor is a personal preference, because my sister loved them.  But my husband and I didn't.

I was pleasantly surprised, not a fan of butterscotch and had some chips to use up, kids really enjoyed as snacks. I did omit brown sugar and reduced the butter by half and subbed whole wheat flour. Next time I would increase the spices.

These muffins are amazing. I used fresh pumpkin not canned. They are so moist. They aren't too sweet even with the butterscotch chips. The spice combination works beautifully. If you make regular sized muffins, as I did, remember to bake them twice as long. The recipe made 16 regular muffins. I highly recommend these.

AWESOME!  These are super moist and super yummy.  I did like other posters said and removed them from the pan quickly as the butterscotch chips will stick to the pan.

These are wonderful mini-muffins!  And I have now discovered why butterscotch morsels were invented!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I have made these 2 times this week and am making them again for a meeting tomorrow.  I didn't have any ginger, so I added some pumpkin pie spice blend instead...  I added some vanilla the second time around and honestly didn't notice a difference in taste.

Yummy! Soft and moist, great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn't have thought of butterscotch chips, myself, but they were great in this recipe! I'm not concerned with the appearance, as some have noted---we had no problem making them disappear!

These had great flavor and the group I made them for raved about them!  The only slight drawback is that they are not beautiful.  You can control the final look somewhat by not over-filling you muffin cups, but the ones that get too full will have chips going every direction, thus a strange looking muffin top.  As far as taste, it's a five-star recipe!

These are pretty darn awesome. I left out the ginger because I didn't have any. They are super moist and buttery. Honestly, I'm not sure when I will ever make them again, because they are soooo fatty, but they taste delicious!

These were amazing!  I didn't think that the butterscotch and the pumpkin were going to go together, but after I read all of the reviews I figured that i'd give it a try.  My family LOVED them!  I made enough to take some to work, but after my family got their hands on them there weren't enough to take anymore.  I will definately make these again.

Very tasty muffins.  I just made them and the kids are devouring them.  We don't like ginger or nutmeg so I omitted these two ingredients. I added 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon.  I should have made a double batch!

These were surprisingly good as others have said.  Very simple and easy.  My husband doesn't like butterscotch chips, so I put aside some batter and added chocolate chips to it instead.  He raved about his kind, too!  Yummy.

What a great recipe.  I tried this today and I used a loaf pan vs mini muffin pan (b/c I didn't have one) - I baked for 43 minutes and the bread is unbelievable.  Such a nice twist on the regular old pumpkin bread.  The butterscotch chips add so much to it. This will definitely be made alot in our house during the fall.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is surprisingly good. I don't usually bake something if chocolate isn't one of the first ingredents, but it just sounded interesting. I didn't have nutmeg or baking powder but took a chance with ground allspice. So good, I urge you to try.

Wonderful taste combo! I think they would be better with mini-butterscotch chips though if you are cooking them in the mini-muffin tin. 
I, like usual, doubled the spices and added pumpkin pie spice. Delicious!

These are so good and healthy too!  We made no changes.  Soft on the inside and crunchy on the top; delicious.  I helped my 11-year old daughter make these; it's a very easy recipe, and nice for the Fall.

These are exceptional...The only change, I made, was to use 3/4 brown sugar as one reviewer noted...Also,I put the chips in the flour mixture so they wouldn't sink to the bottom and stick to the pan...I got 24 minis and 11 regular size muffins out of this recipe...

These are quite possibly the best muffins I have ever made and tried!!  They were easy to make and a hit of the whole family.  I did find that I had to bake for 3 extra minutes to ensure they were firm.

These are really good.  My family loved them.  The taste combination is great.  I used the recipe as stated but made regular size muffins (which take about 20 minutes to bake).

These were good, kinda mild pumpkin flavor, though. Seems like a good base recipe. I halved the recipe with no problem.

I made these little muffins for a friend's party and they were gone in no time!  Butterscotch is a nice and unexpected change from the norm.

Great success, teens and husband loved them.  Didn’t have a mini muffin tin so made them at reg size, baked for 15-17min.  Melted remaining butterscotch chips and lightly drizzled on the top.

I made these and really liked them. My husband was not a huge fan though. They were easy to make and had a nice balance between the pumpkin and butterscotch flavors. I'll make them again when we have guests.

I have been making the most addictive muffins with this recipe for years now! I follow the recipe as stated I just use a pumpkin pie spice mix instead of all the individual spices. I also increase the spice to 3 TSP to balance out the full can of canned pumpkin I add. I substitute coconut sugar for the two in the recipe but that is only because that is the only sugar we use.   I now make these with white chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch chips just because we love white chocolate. These are over the moon fantastic with the butterscotch chips. I have  also made these muffins with no chips at all for my toddler and he loves them. These are super easy to make and my family always begs me to make them because they never last long longer than 48 hours if we are lucky :)

We made these with only one alteration.  We used a whole can of pumpkin instead of one cup and kept everything else as is. They are delicious and my kids loved them. The butterscotch chips melt into the surrounding muffin and it's just delicious. They turned out fluffy and not too oily. With the extra pumpkin, it made 20 muffins.

OMG. Sooo melt in mouth delicious. I didn't have ginger on hand, so I replaced with Allspice, which I think is superior in this recipe. I filled the mini-tins full so the tops of the muffins puffed up nicely. Also dropped a couple extra butterscotch morsels on top before baking.

I didn't really like the pumpkin and butterscotch flavor I thought that it was odd but other than that I didn't find the recipe all that bad. I would defiantly make it again.

Loved these muffins!  The butterscotch and spices balance nicely with the pumpkin.  I made both mini muffins and full sized muffins.  I prefer the full sized muffins because I could only find full sized butterscotch chips.  The chips are a little too large for the mini muffins.  When making full sized muffins simply bake an additional 10-12 minutes.  Next time I may add pecans for a little crunch, but they are fabulous without as well.

A really easy recipe that tastes awesome! I kind of followed the recipe, but I also kinda didn't, I put in way more spices than the recipe called for and I put in about 1/2 cup extra flour and my muffins came out perfect (they took only 8 minutes to bake!). My friends and family already gobbled them up and are asking for more, when I only made them last night!

Wow,Wow,Wow..that says it all. These are fabulous. After reading all the fabulous reviews and finding I had all the ingredients on hand, I knew I had to make these muffins. I am so glad I did...They are so good. I will definitely be making these again! I can't get over how good these are. I've made them twice in the last 2 weeks!

Made exactly as written, my husband and I both liked these mini muffins very much.  I don't think they have a very strong pumpkin flavor though, but they were still good.  I had no problems with them sticking to the pan because I removed them as soon as they came out of the oven.

Flavor and moistness are great. Very easy and quick to make. Next time, I’ll try substituting part of the white flour with wheat or oatmeal. I feel it needs a bit of a heavier texture to go with the butterscotch chips.

Very good recipe! Made as directed, except I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used salted caramel chips - also very yummy! I used a cookie dough scoop to fill my tins and ended up with 24 mini plus 6 regular muffins.

I loved these muffins and so did my family.  Fabulous texture.  Great taste.  Easy to make with no substitutions.  I felt like I was eating a coffee shop muffin.  I loved them.  Will make again and will incorporate butterscotch chips into muffin next time instead of just on top.

This recipe is very similar to my favorite  cookie recipe which has pumpkin with butterscotch chips.  Now I can't decide which I like best.

I think this is the best pumpkin bread/muffin I've ever tasted! I did use homemade pumpkin puree (recipe is cooked and seasoned to be a cross between pumpkin puree and pumpkin butter). Also, I had a feeling that these would taste great so I doubled the recipe anc made regular sized muffins (25 mins) and jumbo muffins (30 mins). Delicious.

The muffin itself was divine; it was spicy and flavorful, just as the recipe was written. However, I wasn't a fan of the butterscotch chips. They seemed to make it taste artificial. Next time I will either substitute them for nuts or regular chocolate chips, or omit them entirely.

Delicious!! I thought the butterscotch and pumpkin might be a little odd. That was before I tried them. :) These muffins are a must make!! They are moist and tasty. My family loves them. :) The only thing I changed was to make full sized muffins instead of minis. Thanks!! :)

This was a hit at two Bible study functions.  The ladies just loved them and they could just pop them in their mouths.  Butterscotch chips add an element that was pleasing.  Be sure to use the mini muffin pan.

This recipe is great as is, no need to change anything! I do like spice so I was a little generous with those  - " heaping" measurements of spices. A double recipe made 24 mini and 16 medium muffins.

I ended up with 96 of these... and they took more than 12 minutes to cook (close to 15). They are nice but not sure I would make again given how many great pumpkin breads/muffins there are on this site.

Yummy!  I made full sized muffins and added about a half cup chopped walnuts.  Cooked them about 8 minutes longer since they were bigger.

Had some left over pumpkin and thought I would give it a try.  Glad I did.  Very tasty not to sweet.  I didn't have any cinnamon so I used All spice also made full size muffins.  My 3 year old son who doesn't care for sweets very much enjoyed these.  Thank you for the recipe.

I was hesitant at first, but they were absolutely delicious! I made regular sized muffins and baked them for about 24 minutes.

So easy, adorable, and delicious. Try. PS I didn't grease the pan and I think they're moist enough and they still come out easily, but I guess it depends on the pan.

These are SO good! Going to be a new favorite around my house! The only change I made was making regular size muffins instead of minis. Of course, I had to bake them longer, but they were great!

Just made these. Oh my goodness, delicious! I used chocolate chips and added walnuts. They tasted and smelled like my mom's raisin spice muffins. They pumpkin keeps them really moist.

I didn't see the "mini muffin" part so I expected this to make too many muffins...so I halved it..and it only made 12 regular sized muffins. So I made another batch. So, if you're making reg sized muffins with this it will make 24.

Kids loved these. Very tasty, but too much sugar.  Keep the brown sugar and get rid of the white.  Also try cutting the butter in half or do applesauce instead.  Put in greased baking cups.  Makes 18 regular muffins, cooking for approx. 20 minutes.

When making this recipe I followed it to the letter.  I was concerned after making my first batch because they fell apart when I was taking them out of the mini muffin pan.  Because of that I would recommend using liners in your muffin pan for these, they don't really hold together well until they cool.  I think it's because of the large amount of butterscotch chips.  That being said I think the butterscotch overwhelmed the pumpkin a bit and next time I'll only be using half the recommended amount.
The muffins were, however, moist and delicious.  My whole family loved them.  Will make again.

Thank you for this reciepe.  I needed something for a large crowd, and wanted something on the unusual side.  I filled the lined cups a little past the top, then cooked them 5 mintues longer.  They looked prettier with a muffin top.  They are awesome.  I know people will want this reciepe.

I used half butterscotch chips and half chocolate chips and it was an awesome twist from the normal pumpkin bread. Definitely recommend this recipe, and it was super easy.

everyone liked this reciepe as is.didn't get very much pumpkin flavor. Used 3/4 bag of butterscotch chips. Next time I may try 1/2 bag instead. You may have to decrease your cooking time if you use less butterscotch chips because it will decrease the amount of moisture. You'll just have to watch them closely so they don't dry out.

Love this recipe. I followed the recipe as is the first time, and the second time, I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter. They baked perfectly and were healthier and absolutely delicious!

I usually don't write reviews BUT these were so good I couldn't resist.  I made it as written but I put the chips in the flour so they wouldn't sink when baking.  And I made big muffins and cooked for 20 mins.  They were so good

These muffins were amazing. I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch because that's what I had on hand but the muffins can out great anyway.  They were very moist and super tasty.  My kids loved them so much they asked for them for dessert instead of candy. Definitely a keeper!!

Made these last night and the family really enjoyed them.  The only changes I made was to add some walnuts (Yum! we like the crunch and flavor of walnuts) and I halved the amount of ginger and nutmeg as our family isn't too keen on super spiced up stuff.  They were great!  The children enjoyed these for breakfast and my little guy requested them for a snack today after school.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love making anything with pumpkin. These had a wonderful flavor, however the butterscotch morsels tended to melt away more than chocolate morsels... since they were a major brand, I am not sure what was going on.  Thanks for sharing!

YUM! I did use white whole wheat flour instead. Heads up, as per another review, I did not pack the brown sugar, and I found that they didn't rise a whole lot, so in the second pan I filled the muffin cups more generously. When presented to my husband he gave me a funny look, but tried them...and proceeded to lick off the cupcake paper. Success!

Recipe is delicious! I altered it by making them full size muffins because I didn't have a mini muffin pan. And then cooked it longer -approx double the time. And then also used half the amount of butterscotch chips and then added the half of amount of chocolate chips.  Turned out scrumdidilyumcious!

Like them a lot. Not something I would normally eat, but the combo reminds me of Fall and the holidays. It would go great with some morning coffee, or some ice cream for a dessert. I used normal sized muffin pans and they made 20 easy - instead of the 48 mentioned.

These were delicious!  I wasn't sure when I read the recipe about the flavor combo, but I am so glad I tried them.  I did not change the recipe at all.  The only thing I did was make them in a cupcake tin instead of as minis.  Still came out great!  I will definitely make these again.

These are fantastic just the way they are. A perfect fall treat! As a tip to those that don't own a sifter, put all the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk.

I had high hopes for these and was a bit underwhelmed, unfortunately. I went with a user comment and did not pack the brown sugar which did result in a nice, light/puffy turnout which looked nice. I would have preferred a stronger pumpkin flavor, personally, so if I make them again I think I'd add more of the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, or just use a good amount of pumpkin pie spice.

These are FANTASTIC muffins. I didn't have any butterscotch chips on hand, so I used mini chocolate chips and walnuts, and they taste amazing! Baked full sized muffins (the recipe made 18 regular muffins), which cooked at 350 for 20 minutes.  I bet these taste great with butterscotch chips- I will have to try that soon. Also, I used all purpose gluten-free baking mix instead of wheat flour, and the recipe still turned out great.  Thank you for such a simple, tasty recipe!

Okay. These are seriously, YUM!! The only thing I changed was, used 3/4 cup brown sugar ( i was right out of white sugar) and used mini butterscotch chips- 1/2 a bag of 300 gram bag. They turned out wonderful and made a second batch using the other half of the butterscotch chips.

These are absolutely AMAZING!!!  I didn't put the butterscotch chips in and I cut back a bit on the butter (only 1/4 cup).  They were soooooo good!!! Next time, I will definitely be making these!

YUMMY! I didn't change a thing in the recipe and they turned out great. Love the flavor combination, but I do wonder how they would be with dried cranberries added in place of the butterscotch chips. May have to give it a shot. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! These were great. Do not change a thing in this recipe. The pairing of the pumpkin and butterscotch seems odd but they compliment eachother so well. The color was also very fall-ish:)

These are pretty tasty! The flavor is nice... not too sweet, not too spice-filled. Following the instructions, I greased my muffin pans very well and baked. That didn't work out so well for me... the butterscotch chips were totally stuck to the sides, so the muffins fell apart into pieces upon removal. For the second batch I used liners and all was well. Thanks :)

I am giving this recipe four stars, only because my husband really liked these. I thought the butterscotch was really weird in it. I think the next time I make these I will leave out the butterscotch chips and then I'll have PERFECT pumpkin muffins. A sweet drizzle on top would be great, too!

These muffins were great. I made them regular size rather than mini and I had to up the cooking time to 25min. I brought them to a potluck and they were a huge hit.

these were great! i used whole wheat flower and oatmeal instead of the white flower, applesauce instead of butter, and white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch and they were delicious. Even my non 'health concious' brother liked them and didnt even know they were healthy!! this was very very good everyone liked it!!!

I have made these a couple of times now, and they get fantastic raving reviews from my guests! I call them "ugly" muffins because they're not the prettiest, but they are so delicious, no one cares. I have only made them in regular-sized muffin pans and if you cook them for 20 minutes, they come out perfect. 
YUM.

I made these muffins today using the "healthier" suggestions of another cook / reviewer: white whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, brown sugar instead of white sugar - they were delicious!  Moist, yummy, great texture, and the butterscotch was a great twist on the flavor.  My 3 year old twins kept asking for more - in fact when I went to package them up for our gift giving, there were a few more missing than I had given them!  I found out today that they can now reach the high counter!

These are great. The texture is perfect. I've made other pumpkin muffins that were too sticky.

I baked these in a regular size muffin pan. I don't remember for how long...probably around 30 minutes.

I love butterscotch and I love pumpkin...  just stands to reason that I'd love this muffin recipe.  But it's just OK.  The tastes don't clash, but they both cancel out the wonderfulness of the other, lea;ving no real satisfaction either way.  This wasn't a waste of time, but I probably wont crave to do it again.

We really enjoyed these mini muffins, and I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  We cut back the white sugar to 1/3 cup, and still found the muffin very sweet with all the chips.  I may add less chips next time.  Interesting blend of flavors!

These were a cinch to make, and had a beautiful moist texture, but I thought that the spices and butterscotch chips totally overpowered the pumpkin.  If they were called "butterscotch muffins" I would've liked them better I think, but I was expecting more pumpkin taste.

These were good, though not exceptional.  Like other reviewers, I had a hard time getting these out of the tin as the chips really adherred to the pan.  The chips also seemed to cook rather than soften - maybe baking at a lower temperature would help.  I think this recipe may work a little better with regular sized muffin tins as the chips were a bit oversized for such a small muffin.

This was a delicious spin on pumpkin muffins and as many have said the butterscotch and pumpkin combo really is yummy!!!! The only ingredient change that I made was replacing the nutmeg with ground clove.  I am not a fan of nutmeg, and the clove is a great replacement.  I made a loaf and regular size muffins (6 to a pan).  I followed some other suggestions for the cook time with the loaf and it was not long enough (the middle was still not cooked all the way through after 45 minutes.) If you are going to make a loaf, bake time will be about 70 minutes at 350.  I cooked the muffins at 350 for 19 minutes and they were perfect.  I will definitely make these again. They were a hit with my husband’s coworkers and my family!!

These were tasty, but I had trouble with the texture.  The butterscotch chips were so firm in contrast to the softness of the pumpkin muffin.  I also had a hard time with my muffins sticking to my non-stick pan (Which I also sprayed with non-stick spray.)  It seems like the chips all sank to the bottom.

These are delicious. My 9 yo pronounced them "irresistible". I baked 2 pans of mini muffins and 1 small pan of regular sized.(It made 6- baked for 18 min.)The combination does sound odd, but it is really good.

Just made them this afternoon.  I follwed the recipe exactly but I baked regular size muffins. It made about 16 muffins-I fill them high.  The batter was so fluffy and easy to work with.  I enjoyed it!  The butterscotch pieces made a mess of my muffin pans so I may try cupcake liners next time.  The pumpkin and butterscotch works well together even though it sounds odd.   Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

These just may be the yummiest muffins I have ever had! (even better than those purchased at a bakery or coffee shop!!) I followed the recipe exactly (but I didn't have nutmeg so had to skip that) and made half mini muffins half big ones. I love both butterscotch and pumpkin so I thought the combination of the two was fabulous. My husband, however, dislikes butterscotch, but even he liked these. Try them, you won't be sorry!

I brought these into work and got rave reviews on them (still getting them 2 weeks later).  Not only are they delicious, but they're a perfect grab-em-and-go for the teacher's lounge!

I loved these!  Pumpkin and butterscotch sounds like an odd combination, but it was perfect.  They're very addicting ... I can't keep from popping another one in my mouth!  These are very moist, and kept well for 5 days.  I might try a little cinnamon and sugar on top next time for a little crunch.

DEFINITELY A *****(5 star) RECIPE!!!
I made them as printed but used regular size muffin pans and baked for 25 minutes. This will be a regular in our family especially for the holidays! We love them at room temperature. Thanks for sharing your "YUMMY" recipe!!!!!

In a word: fantastic. I made full-size muffins as opposed to mini muffins, and nobody could get enough of them!

These were wonderful!  I used bread flour instead of AP flour (its what I had) and 2t of pumpkin pie spice instead of mixing my own spices, but otherwise left the recipe alone. The recipe was easy to follow and the bake time was spot on - thank you for a great recipe. :)

I made these muffins for the first time and everyone I work with loved them so much I had to give them all the recipe.  I did change it slightly by adding 1 cup of milk.  They are very good!

The muffins turned out good....a little sweet if eaten hot.  They are actually better the next day.  I'm going to try switching the butterscotch chips for white chocolate or semi sweet chocolate chips next time.

This recipe is what fall is all about- all of the flavors combined in this recipe are perfect and I don't even consider myself to be a "pumpkin-person."  I followed this recipe as originally written and I am so happy I did.  
Everyone needs to try these.

Made these for our church's board meeting.  They were a great hit.  We are going to be serving them at our dessert fundraiser next Month.

I made this recipe gluten and egg free through substitutions, and it STILL worked well. I was generous with the spices, added some ground cloves and cardamom as well. Didn't have the chips so I chopped candied ginger and added walnuts and pecans. Very good combo with the pumpkin spices.

These are amazing.  I've made them many times, and the recipe needs no changes.  They're great fresh out of the oven, but they're even better at room temperature the next day!
