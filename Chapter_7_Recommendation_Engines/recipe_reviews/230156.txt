I've made this one several times.  The first time, I followed it as written.   It was good but pretty soggy and lacked kick  Next, I added fresh lime juice, which really perked it up.  Then I tried it with Mission tortilla strips instead of fresh tortillas - OK and not as soggy.  Also did it with pre-fab pico de gallo to which I added the tomatillos.  Pretty good.  And substituted cheddar for the plain Jack - much better than using 2 kinds of Jack as written.  Actually, it was very tasty any way I made it, but always came out soggy. Probably can't fix that, though.  Because of the sog factor, I rate it 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.

How did I forget to rate this?  We loved this dinner.  Amazingly I was able to buy fresh tomatillos in NY in January!  This will be repeated many more times.  Thanks!

This was excellent.  I made it first for my friends at work and they raved about it.  My family was the second test because they are not cilantro fans including me and we all loved it!  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  A keeper and something new at least for us!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Great flavor. I omitted the mint and ramped up the heat a bit by leaving the seeds in the jalapeno. Could not locate any Poblano peppers the day I went shopping so I used Anaheim peppers (roasted them first & peeled skins) 
I served hot flour tortillas filled with the shredded chicken and used the this as a sauce, then topped with the cheeses. Rolled up and ate like a burrito. The next day, I used leftovers for breakfast and added scrambled egg. Yummy both ways!

My whole family loved this recipe and it was a great way to use our tomatillos. We found it to be a little dry, though, but it was fine after we added some salsa at the table. If I make it again, I'll probably double the tomatillo sauce. I used pepper jack cheese but substituted cheddar cheese for the monterey jack, and I wouldn't do that again. The cheddar got pretty tough.

This was not the easiest thing I've ever made but by no means the hardest and was soon worth it in the end.  I roasted the tomatillos, garlic and peppers for about 20 minutes before blending everything and the flavors really popped!  Definitely recommend for a beginner cook looking for a little challenge.

This was fantastic, after a little adjusting with spices like thyme and basil it came out great!

I do want to say I did try this just to see how this would taste but, not good at all. This is not an original recipe  as we dont use melting cheese. I'm Mexican so this is way different nothing to do with original.  if you omit the mint and cilantro and use fresh cheese (Queso Freso) plus when you ready to serve than add cheese above and sourcream, a sunny side egg or scramble yumm heaven. plus when you add the salsa serve them right away only way to have them a little crunch :)

I made this for my family and they  loved it!  I added black beans and corn to it for some extra flavor and disregarded the mint and jalape√±os because of the kids. I did this in 2 layers like a lasagna and added shredded pepper jack cheese in the middle layer and on the top. My boys and wife loved this so much that they want this to become a regular weekend dish!

This was very good, somewhat like chili verde chicken enchilada casserole. I increased the recipe by half and in  doing so added an anaheim with 2 pasilla's and 2 jalapeno. We realized it was going to take some time with frying the tortillas so we had 2 pans going.  We used queso fresco as the additional cheese. We will make again. It's nice to ty something different. Thanks for the recipe
