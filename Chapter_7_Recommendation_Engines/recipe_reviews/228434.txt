These were absolutely delicious!!! The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I didn't roll in sugar just before baking (forgot).  We certainly didn't miss it though! These are soooo gooey just out of the oven, but are just as yummy at room temperature.  I will definitely be putting these on my Christmas cookie list this year!

Amazing!! My daughter's allergic to nuts, so I melted the extra Rolos with a tablespoon of heavy cream and drizzled that on the warm cookies instead. Incredible!! Definitely a keeper!

It's important to use natural baking cocoa like Hershey's rather than Dutch processed. The recipe calls for baking soda so you need to use the natural cocoa. Otherwise they will turn out dry and hard. I brought these to a Christmas party and they were chewy and delicious. I used natural cane sugar with the larger crystals.

These came out great and we are in a baking contest to see if they will win. I didn't change anything about the recipe but I did do one batch with sea salt on top and one with sugar. Also, use a small teaspoon to measure cookies not tablespoon.

These cookies are awesome. I didn't drizzle the chocolate on top yet. I did however put sea salt on top instead of sugar. They turned out amazing both with and without the salt on top. I baked for 8 min and they were perfect.

Great! A lot more fudgy/brownie like than I expected, but I didn't mind because I love brownies more than cookies.

These were great, I skipped the sugar so they wouldn’t be too rich, doesn’t affect anything! Still delicious and my kids want me to make some more.

I use this recipe all the time! Although it does take a bit longer than other recipes, it's DEFINITELY worth it. I get compliments every time I make it! I don't use the almond bark over the top, though, because I think the cookie is sweet enough already.

I love this cookie! It's easy and so elegant. Hard to eat more than one at a time though, it's very rich. It's the kind of cookie you need a cup of coffee with.

This is one of my families favorites!  I was so glad to see it here when I was searching for my little recipe card (yes I still use them for extra special recipes, and this is one!)... These are delicious, chocolatey,  with a chewy caramel center and they disappear like magic in my house..   The kids will even work to unwrap the Rolos for me if I bake these for them.  :)

These went over well. Had too strong of a vanilla flavor for my liking. The first couple cookies fell through my cooling rack.  I added wax paper (or parchment paper) to the rack to solve that. A couple cookies ended up with paper stuck to them.

Made these for the first time tonight, and they turned out perfect!  My only change was the accidental addition of 2 tbsp baking powder (brain fart), but it didn't cause any problems. Make sure to COMPLETELY seal the Rolo inside!!! Even a tiny hole will let the liquefied caramel leak out during baking (this only happened to a couple of mine). One batch made 55 cookies for us.  These cookies have the taste and texture of brownies, and the white sugar on top creates a nice crunch. Out of the five recipes we baked this Christmas, these are hands-down my daughter's new favorite. This recipe is getting added to our permanent holiday/potluck baking list!

I've had this recipe for years and somehow all my Christmas cookie recipes went missing this year. This is the same recipe I had before except as shown in the picture I add a few chopped pecans to the top as a little garnish. Everyone loves these and a whole batch was demolished by my coworkers in 2 hours.

I came across a similar recipe over 20 years ago on the back of a bag of Pillsbury flour. I used to make these quite a bit back then. I had lost the recipe and found it again on here. These came out great! The only thing I do different is add pecans to the batter and roll the cookies in chopped pecans after the sugar. The pecans aren't in the original recipe, but my cousin requested them once and I liked how they came out. Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious even without rolling in sugar but on about 1/3 of mine the caramel popped out of the bottom of the cookie which was disappointing.

These cookies are best when cooled slightly after baking. When eating completely cooled the next day, the caramel is kind of hard to bite.  I did not drizzle chocolate on top. I rolled some cookies with sugar and some without. We enjoyed the cookies  without the sugar much better!

Waaaay too hard cookies, would have been good but I couldn't even bite into them. I tried to bake them for less time and they ended up raw.
