This was a bit bland for us.  I added a bay leaf, an onion, frozen cut okra, and some browned hamburger meat, but beef broth instead of chicken broth might have helped.

This turned out really good, but as usual, I had to change a few things! I didn't have any cabbage, so that was out, but instead I added an onion and some mushrooms.  I also did not have any fresh garlic, so I added almost a teaspoon of garlic powder, and it was fine.  I used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 vegetable broth, and cut the water down to two and a half cups.  I added basil and oregano, and fresh parsely, too.  It all turned out really tasty, but I think it would have been bland without my additions. Thanks!

Great recipe. I used vegetable broth in place of chicken, brown rice in place of the pasta and added a squirt or two of Bragg's at the end with the garlic. I'll make this again and again with various additions. Oh, I also completely left out the water and opted for an extra cup of broth.

Used vegetable broth to make this a vegetarian meal and added an extra clove of garlic and half an onion.  So delicious!  Great for these cold winter days - thanks for sharing this recipe!

This soup is tasty.  I added extra garlic, also added onion, as well as lentils. I left out the pasta. You can personalize this soup to your liking and it will turn out great everytime!!

Great recipe.  The broth is perfect.  I was unsure about using cabbage but it works.  I would add more types of veggies next time.

Tasty soup.  I used a full head of cabbage.  Used whole-wheat macaroni spirals.  My husband really likes this soup, and generally he doesn't request soup.  The flavor of this soup is even more amazing after a day or two in the fridge.  I served it with some Irish Brown Bread.

Great base recipe - easy, healthy and very tasty.  I played around with this and altered the base ingredients.  I only needed 6 cups of fluid in total - 4 cups chicken stock, 1 and half of vegetbale stock and half a cup of red wine, 1 teaspoon of sugar helped to balance these changes.  I sauteed the garlic with 1/4 of a large onion at the start, then added my other vegetables as per the recipe.  Because I was going for a complete meal on a bowl, I added 2 skinless poached chicken breast halves.  I poached in water flavoured with some red wine and 2 stock cubes.  After chopping the chicken into bite size pieces, I added it half way through the simmering period.  Delicious with soy and linseed bread.

This was a former faceless recipe. A good basic vegetable soup with unlimited possibilities.  I used my own homemade chicken broth and added tri-color rotini.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great soup! I wanted this vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and added more vegetables like other reviewers. I added 1/2 large onion, and a leek. The only tomatoes we had were Italian stewed tomatoes which made the soup taste a lot like minestrone. My DH and our room mate loved it. This was also very easy to make.  Next time I might add more liquid to accommodate the extra veggies and add the cabbage later on to keep it crispy.

This was delicious!  I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, added lentils, leeks, an onion and three extra whole garlic cloves and 2 bay leaves.  I didn't have enough canned tomatoes so I also used fresh.  My husband ate his soup with a little fresh lemon squeezed into it.

Fantastic soup!  I added a bit of chopped green pepper to the cabbage and carrot saute, and sprinkled the vegetables lightly with soy sauce as they cooked.  I used diced tomatoes flavored with garlic and basil, a sprinkle or two of garlic salt, added a bay leaf, and a bit of white pepper.  Finally, I used shells instead of macaroni, because thats what I had.  Wonderful flavor, served with thick slices of buttered french bread, mmmmm.

I thought this turned out pretty good. I had some spinach I threw into it also, which added more color and nutrients. Didn't really change anything. I was surprised it had as much flavor as it did. I used more garlic in the beginning and at the end and more black pepper but that was it. My husband liked it to.

My family LOVED this soup! I was a bit skeptical about the cabbage but my kids loved it. I added onion but did not add the pasta because my beloved does not like pasta at all. This is a keeper! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Yum, this was good, but not as garlicky as I thought it might be...

I used beef broth as someone suggested, did without the extra 3 1/2 cups water (if I added it, it would have been too watery for me) and used 1 cup of brown rice instead of the pasta. I even added an extra clove - 4 total. Next time I'll add a bunch more. 

Oh, I added some diced venison, too and you could have sworn it was beef. :)

I made this soup this weekend, and it was wonderful.  I added mushrooms and onion, and substituted cheese & garlic tortellin for the elbow macaroni.  Easy to make, and everyone loved it.

Excellent, simple recipe. I added a touch of fresh ginger and imitation crab meat. I also used alphabet macaroni instead of elbow macaroni and it worked well.

instead of only 1/2 tsp of pepper i put 2 tsp along with 2tsp kosher salt, parsley, oregano, and basil.  one onion.   also i put all the chicken broth but no water and it was perfect for us, i don't like it to be more broth than substance.  also added 16 oz chicken breast cause i was wanting a chicken vegetable.   really good with the additions, i feel it would have been pretty bland without the extra spices especially with all that water

I loved this soup. I'm vegan with a Flesh eating zombie as a boyfriend :) Anyway it's been a while since I cooked anything for him because he's adamant about having flesh on everything.

After making it as directed, I thought there was FAR too much liquid for the amount of veggies.  I doubled the carrots, celery, and cabbage, but used a couple fresh tomatoes, because I had no more canned.  The pepper still overpowered everything.  It calls for no salt, so at the end I added 1 t and it was still very bland.  I can't even see that this is a starter recipe.

This is delicious!  I use an onion in place of the cabbage (dh doesn't like cabbage, however it would be wonderful with the cabbage) and sauteed the garlic the last minute with the other veggies (we like a "sweet" garlic flavor rather than strong), pureed one of the cans of tomatoes, used homemade veggie stock instead of the chicken broth, and used whole wheat macaroni.  Very good, will definitely make again.

This is a great soup! Everyone in the family raved about it.  I will add more noodles next time, and I also added 1 cup of brown rice which gave it a great texture.  Omitted the water and just increased veggie broth.
