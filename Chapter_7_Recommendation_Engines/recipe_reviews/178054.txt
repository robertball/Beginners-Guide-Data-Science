These quesadillas were delicious, only I added salsa inside as well. An easy lunch that my son and I really loved.

I used Whole grain tortilla and used a stainless steel skillet with EVOO because of the leeching problems of non-stick pans.  This was so amazing!  I made this for lunch today and it was done in minutes, literraly.  I used pre-washed spinach as that was all the grocer had.  I used the one green onion, chopped and just sprinkled a handful of cheddar each time, and sprinkled the spices, did not measure.  This was so delicious and I want some more!  But, of course I will have some tomorrow again for a snack or even dinner.  Yummy! Thanks for posting, I will make this often as stated and using chicken instead of the spinach for a nice change.

This was awesome!!!! It is so quick to make! I made it for lunch for myself - so I used only one low-carb. rectangular whole wheat wrap, placed the cheese on half the wrap, spinach and spices on top and cheese on top of that. I covered it with the other half of wrap and flipped it when it got crispy on one side. Delicious!

This was great!  I modified it a little bit.  I used frozen spinach.  I cooked the spinach in the microwave and then added the chili powder and garlic powder to the spinach.  I did decrease the garlic powder to 1/4 tsp.  I didn't add the green onion.  I followed the rest of the procedure in the frying pan.  I served it with sour cream.  It would have been great with salsa but I didn't have any salsa in the house.

Very good and the creator is right - super quick!  I made this in a snap for lunch.  Just made half a quesadilla though as a whole one would be too filling for lunch.  I used a 6-inch WW tortilla, also sauteed the spinach along with some button mushrooms as I do love how they compliment each other in a dish. I only used a TEENSY bit of cheese and topped with some medium salsa. YUM! Had all the ingredients in the house and it hit the spot. Thanks for the great recipe idea - but for anyone else, if you like mushrooms - definitely saute some first and add to the spinach!

Spinach & Whole Wheat Quesadillas' Haiku: "Healthy, tasty lunch. I wouldn't mind more veggies. But it was still great!" I followed the recipe exactly, only using Mexi-cheese blend instead of Cheddar. I think I would've been happier if I'd lightly sauteed some onion with garlic and wilted the spinach first, rather than using raw green onion and garlic powder, but my belly was still happy w/ the results. And giggle all you want, but I adore the "Xtreme Wellness High Fiber" tortillas (anything w/ the word "Extreme", or minus the "E", makes me shudder), but when they're grilled w/ tasty fillings, I can ignore the goofy name of them and revel in the fact that they're super-good for you.

I add red peppers for a little extra flavour and nutrition, but they are delicious either way!

Makes a good and quick lunch.  Also would be great served with soup. I left out the chili powder because I didn't think it really went with the other flavors.

I was heading out to a fast food joint because I was craving quesadillas but turned back home and decided to make my own; that's when I came across this recipe.  Delicious!  They turned out great even though I didn't have green onions at hand.  Simple, easy to make and soooooooo much better than any fast food version. Yummy!

Wow, these are so good and easy!  I was looking for a quesadilla recipe and I happened to have some leftover spinach.  The chili powder and garlic powder are perfect.  Highly recommend as an appetizer!

I'd recommend shredding the spinach into smaller pieces to make it easier to eat.

These were soooo good and much healthier than normal quesadillas. I added turkey sausage as well, which was an excellent choice. Will definitely be making these again.

This was a nice idea to switch up my usual bean and cheese quesadillas. Scallions are a nice touch. Delicious with a mug of tomato soup.

This was pretty good. Next time I will saute some onion, garlic, and spinach in a pan first though, and leave out the chili powder. These definitely need to be served with salsa and sour cream, they are too plain on their own.

Pretty good, though I make it with multigrain tortillas out of preference and added some scrambled egg substitute to make it more substantial. Very helpful quesadilla-flipping tip!

I love this recipe the sky's the limit.  I didn't cook mine long enough because I like mine crispy. We don't need no stinkin' restaurants.

I enjoyed this and everyone ate it all up including my 18 month old. I did add some cooked chicken breast for a little protein. Yummy!

Quick, easy, and tasty. I also sautéed mine in a stainless steel pan with some canola cooking spray. I added mushrooms, and instead of garlic powder used Mrs Dash -garlic and herb seasoning.

I sauteed the spinach, green onion, and seasonings briefly before layering with the cheese on the tortilla.  You can be sure I'll be making these again soon!

Great way to use up some spinach before it goes bad. Not too unhealthy either, for a quesadilla. Mine did not take quite as long to cook, make sure to keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn.

These were great. We have been trying to eat less meat, and these make a great lunch. I have made them a few times and we like them with mozzarella or feta cheese. Goes nice with the spinach. Update: Try adding artichokes - OMG! YUM!

I really liked this. It was a quick and tasty lunch. I ate it with some black beans and sour cream on the side. I used a taco cheese blend. I'll be making this again.

I made it but with whole milk Mozzarella. A restaurant owner from Jalisco makes excellent ones. We asked him the type of white cheese he used: whole milk mozzarella. Excellent lunch or dinner. In Venezuela they use Queso de Mano. 

They don't use cheddar!

I have been making these for as long as I can remember. Sometimes I add sautéed mushrooms. Delicious quesadillas served with sour cream on the side.

I have already made this several times. I crave it. Cabot sharp cheddar is very good.  Great as is. You don't need to measure and can use garlic salt and red pepper if that is what you have on hand. This is the first quesadilla I have successfully made. Thanks for posting it.

These were delicious. I added mushrooms I cooked in xvoo and balsamic to these, and did them in the oven. I topped them with chopped tomatoes, and they turned out great! (the first time).

The second time I made these, I followed the recipe pretty much to the "T," and they were amazing, if not better then the first time. Actually I think they are one of my favorite go to's for a quick easy dinner.

I loved them! Added whole cloves of garlic and sautéed all together with Adobe seasoning.  Had to throw chicken in the ones I made for my family as they are total meat-eaters. Also, we ate with a little sour cream for dipping.

This was awesome and so easy to make! I used Mexican shredded cheese because that was all I had and it was great. I will be making this again.
