This is a nice Americanized Mexican goulash-type dish. Quick and easy, the ingredients are stuff I have in the larder all the time. I made it just as the recipe specified and it was a snap to put together. You might want to add such optional toppings as grated cheese, sour cream, guacamole, chopped scallions, cilantro, etc. Thanks for a good recipe, Cacki!

This is a great one pot meal! I didn't have a bell pepper, so I used a 4 oz. can of mild green chili peppers.  I also added a chopped carrot, one chopped celery stalk, and one half cup beef broth for flavor and color. For toppings, I put out black olives, cheese, and avocados. Hubby loved it!

Easy Mexican Goulash Haiku: "This one surprised us! Made it like a casserole, baked dinnertime." Made this as written (using small can Mexi-corn instead of the frozen, and rotini instead of elbows) a day ahead in a covered pyrex and when it came time to prepare, I put the cheese on top and baked it 350 for about 20 min. covered, then uncovered for another 5-10 min. Even though it was a very easy dish to prepare, this way made my evening infinitely easier, which I need b/c I have a newborn, and have to make meals in advance. But we were really quite astonished as to how good this was, for the ease of preparation and for having the ingredients almost always around.

This one pot meal was so easy to whip up for just me and the boys. Used the whole bell pepper and cut the corn off the cob. Topped with all the stuff you put on tacos....the boys woofed it down, so it gets five stars.

I added a can of black beans and black olives. Once I added the noodles to the meat mixture, I placed it all in a 9x13 casserole dish, topped with cheese and baked 20 min. at 375. Delicious!!!!!

This really was easy!  And it made A LOT too.  For my personal tastes, I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and a 15-oz can of black beans (drained), and served topped w/ shredded Monterrey Jack and chopped cilantro.  Recipe doesn't say whether to drain tomatoes -- DON'T! -- the additional moisture helps the simmering process and makes for a good finished consistency.

I made some twists to this. We like spicy! i used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of farmer John hot sausage. Added an entire chopped onion, red and green bell peppers, rotel tomatoes, black beans, corn, cilantro, cumin.  depending on your like for spicy, go ahead and add spicy Mexican tomato sauce, once i used enchilada sauce as it was all i had. You can kick up the spice more with red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper etc . I topped it with green onion or cilantro, what ever is on hand and those tortilla strips ( I'VE MADE MY OWN, CUT STRIPS OF CORN TORTILLAS AND FRY) or jalapeno salad toppings, sprinkle of cheese! Use an entire pound of noodles. Gets better a day later. Also freezes for another meal. Put in a bag then boil the bag later to cook. Guess I totally obliterated the original recipe. Just think Mexican. I can see cat's in it.  Be creative. Add Mexican rice. I make that spicy too. Hmmm chill it and make it a salad. I've made Mexican salad.

This was a big hit at our dinner table last night.  I used an entire green pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The green chilies and salsa lent a nice spiciness to the dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Cacki!

Wow!  We loved this.  My son loves tacos too, but I think they are too messy to eat, sometimes.  This was perfect compromise.  All the taste of a good taco, without the hassle of putting out all the toppings.  I did put out a bowl of tortilla chips for anyone that wanted to scoop them up that way, lol.  Well done!!

This is a great goulash variation!  My son mixes his corn into whatever we're having for dinner, so this recipe saves him a step. Ha! I made it when my parents were visiting from out of state, and my mom asked for the recipe.

Yum Yum! My boyfriend and I loved this.  Creamy and cheesy and good!  Next time I'm going to add a can of rinsed black beans and some green chilis, just to bulk it up and add even more flavor. I truly see this becoming a part of our dinner rotation. Leftovers heated up well for lunch the next day. Thanks for this!

Delicious! I was skeptical about using taco seasoning and whistershire in it but it couldn't have been better! I had to use canned corn because I didn't have frozen and it worked just fine. So easy to fix and ready in no time. This is a keeper!

Quick and easy! I substituted green pepper for black beans. I also added a little more salsa than what the recipe called for. We like it spicy so we kicked it up a notch with cumin!

Yum! This was great! I added mushrooms bc we had them and believe you could add any veggies. If you do, just add additional salsa for liquid. I opt out on taco seasoning - too much sodium. I used rigatoni bc that's all we had - I think smaller noodles would be better. We baked it after mixing altogether, using about 3/4 C cheddar on top. Everyone enjoyed it!! Thanks for sharing this!

Really great basic and easy recipe. It was looking like it was going to be dryer than my family enjoys prior to adding the pasta, so I also added a small can of red enchilada sauce, a can of cream of Chicken soup and a half of a can of black beans. My family loved it and we will be making this again! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this with minor variations. Used approximately 1.5lbs of ground beef, because of this I used an entire packet of taco season and a about 3/4 cup salsa. 1 can of corn, 1 4oz can of green chilis and 1 can tomato, basil & garlic stew tomatoes.

This is a simple & quick recipe. I always have these ingredients on hand. I like how  I can adjust the spiciness of it by using medium or hot rotel/ salsa. Next time I will try the different toppings that are suggested by others.

We made this and it made it into our collection !  Only thing we did differently was to add a pinch of cilantro, grated cheddar cheese and a pinch of salt once plated.  Its a good one thanks for sharing!

Made it as stated the first time (although doubled the recipe for our large family) and it came out a bit on the dry side. The second time I added the whole jar of Salsa to each pot. I also added a cup of pepper jack cheese to each pot and stirred it into the warm noodles. It was a big hit with the kids. Finding something all 5 kids like is no easy feat, so thank you!

We cooked refried beans and mixed the beans in with each individual serving. Not bad.

As is, I thought it needed a bit more "sauce", but this is very good! I did include a full jar of salsa and additional taco seasoning (I used " Taco Seasoning I" from the site) for more flavor. Topped with shredded cheese.

I doubled the recipe, but left out the peppers and only added one can of rotel instead of two. It was delicious! I'll definitely make it again!

My daughter and I both love this recipe! we changed a couple of small things -- made actual taco meat - a little extra worsteshire sauce and extra chili powder. Delicious!
