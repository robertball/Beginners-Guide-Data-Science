I love ham that tastes like HAM.   I would suggest using a Turkey sized oven bag to heat the ham - it really protects the meat and keeps it moist.

I loved this  ham recipe. I did use a  oven bag as suggested in another review. I made a big pot of beans with the ham bone and for once the beans didn't have a sweet taste to them. This will be the only way I bake a ham. Great job, simple is always better.

I find this to be a good recipe to build on. I  mixed the chicken broth with gravy, pepper and garlic and cooked at a lower temperature for a longer time and it came out great. Of all the food I made for Thanksgiving (not including dessert), this was the most popular.

Loved this. It allowed the smoke flavor in the ham stand out and was much better for left overs than a sweet baked ham. Did take longer than noted about an extra hour.

This came out really good!!!  For so simple a recipe it had great ham flavor, everyone kept saying how juicy the ham was. I basted every 20 min or so with the juices as stated,covered in foil and let the game rest about 20 min before slicing. Not dry at all and I even cooked my ham a bit longer. I will definitely make this again.

I used the slow cooker instead.  I put in the broth, then the ham.  I had to make a few adjustments, but it still worked fine.  My wife is diabetic, so we can't do the sugar thing

I'm trying to cut the sugar use in our home and this recipe was perfect for that. We enjoy ham but not all of the sugary sweetness of a glaze. I cooked a 9 lb. ham using chicken broth except I cooked it at 325 for 2 1/2 hours. The meat came out tender and delicious . I saved the juices in the refrigerator, scraped the fat off the top and will use the remaining juices, along with the bone, for a pot of soup. Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

I love this as my family also does not like sweet ham. I have made this many times and I add garlic cloves to the broth.

This is the way my mother always made her ham and everyone raved about it.  She did bake it in a brown paper bag though to keep it moist.  Someone always asked her for her special recipe and they were surprised to find out that her special technique was just baking it in a bag with nothing else.

Made as is, just added some minced garlic to the broth and put a tent while cooking. Perfect.

Good stuff.  I put some mustard seed and house seasoning on it and covered it with foil.  One of the best hams I've had.

Absolutely delicious.  I did use an oven bag for moistness, as was mentioned in other reviews.  I also used boneless ham and it turned out perfect.  It will be my forever recipe for ham dinners.

This was a very good ham. I baked it in a roasting bag. We had an 8 lb ham. I used a full can of low sodium chicken broth . Cooked it at 325 for about 3 hours. It was perfect.

My daughter moved out recently and it's just me and my Sig-O at home. We both love this recipe and it allows for more creative use of leftovers. I made a cherry and crushed pineapple sauce on the side to be used optionally.

This is the perfect non-sweet ham.  Made it for my father-in-law, who doesn’t like sweet hams and he loved it!  Comes out tender and the few leftovers freeze and reheat just fine.

This is the way I love ham! I took advice from another and put it in an oven bag in the oven for 3 hours at 325 degrees with a 10 lb ham. Nice and juicy! Yumm! The way mom used to make it!!

Fantastic!!! So simple and so good!!! My husband doesn’t like the sweet glazes that most people use so I was looking for a recipe that brought out the great flavor of ham on its own. I made this for thanksgiving this year and the whole family loved it!! Will make ham like this from now on.

Delicious and not sweet. I used a large oven bag to keep it simple. I had to cook it for just over 2 hours to fully cook.
