I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday, his favourite cake is carrot cake. They turned out well, he loved them...I topped them with a few curls of shaved white chocolate for pizzaz! The only complaint I have is that the recipe for the icing makes a totally ridiculous amount of icing - a big waste of ingredients!! Next time I'd cut the icing recipe at least in half.

This recipe was fabulous!!  I doubled the cupcake recipe and kept the frosting recipe as is and had just the right amount of frosting.  I found that once the frosting was on the cupcakes the orange flavor was just right, not overpowering at all.  I used 1 C. whole wheat flour to 2 C. all-purpose flour and substituted coconut for the walnuts.  I kept everything else the same and got rave reviews and many requests for this recipe!  I definitely recommend using this recipe.

I once again made these cupcakes this time for a summer Sunday evening BBQ. Made with the frosting from Carrot Cake III. Once again received rave reviews and many comments that they are delicious and moist!

These were exactly like my grandma's carrot cake she used to make.  I changed it up a bit...1/2 apple sauce for 1/2 the oil, whole wheat flour, brown sugar for white.  Super moist and tasty.

The cupcakes turned out excellent!  People at work were practically fighting over them.  I will concur with the other reviewers who said this recipe makes WAY TOO MUCH frosting.  I doubled the batch because it says it only makes 12 cupcakes, but I actually ended up with close to 50, which I thought I was generously frosting until I was done and there was still a full two cups of frosting left!!! And I didn't double the frosting recipe!  I also didn't have any orange extract so I put a dot of lemon extract in and it gave the frosting a nice citrusy flavor without being overpowering.  I put an entire 20 oz can of crushed pineapple (which I drained, but not very well) in the cake batter because I didn't feel like wasting it.  I will make these again, but maybe not so many!

Two thumbs up!

I cut the frosting recipe in half per the advice of another review, which is an excellent idea.  On top of that, I modified to make a lower calorie frosting and cut the butter in half along with using milk instead of cream and the frosting was still excellent.  Will make again!

These are SO good!  Really decadent. (And I thought I "didn't like" carrot cake.)  My daughter saw some beautiful carrot cupcakes w/cream cheese frosting at Trader Joe's and wanted to buy them; I told her we'd do better and make some instead!  This recipe looked good, and it was.  I have never made carrot cake before and was unsure of the pineapple, but it's great.  I also thought the batter was really liquidy, but I guess it's supposed to be that way.  I got 15 cupcakes out of this.  I reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I used 1% milk in the frosting, not cream, and it was fine.  I made all of the frosting (used Neufchatel), and yes it is too much, but I was expecting that because I read the reviews.  I'm going to use the rest to frost some chocolate cookies.  The frosting is really good; I added an extra ounce of white chocolate.  Next time I would only do 3 cups of sugar- it's pretty sweet as-is.  You can really taste the orange too but I like that.  This recipe is really good, and almost perfect (except for the sugar) so it gets 5 stars from me!

This is an exceptional carrot cake cupcake recipe!  The cupcakes are moist and full of flavor!  I shreddded the carrots on the fine side of my shredder.  As for the crushed pineapple, I wasn't sure if I should drain it or not -- I drained it and saved the juice and added about half of the reserved juice at the end when I saw the consistency.  With that said, I think the recipe would be absolutely fine if the pineapple is drained or not.  I did not use the frosting on this recipe -- I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

Excellent! I like this recipe best than putting regular carrot cake batter in cupcake tins because it's less spastic in the oven. These did sink after they came out, but were moist and delicious. Tip: Bake at 400 for 8 minutes and then reduce heat to 350 and bake until done. This encourages domed cupcakes. It should make around 12 cupcakes; I made the mistake of putting too little batter in each cup because of past experience, and the cupcakes weren't high enough to pass the tops of the liners.

These were very tasty but flat as pancakes!  Maybe because the recipe doesn't call for baking powder??  Not sure....will try again with baking powder as well as baking soda.......

I just used the icing from this recipe 'cause it sounded absolutely amazing.... and it was!!! I did a few things differently though. Orange extract was about $8 more expensive than Lemon extract so I went with Lemon. And the recipe calls for WAY WAY WAY too much sugar in my opinion. >.

These were very tasty, but I changed the recipe a bit: applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup regular flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, replaced half of the regular sugar with splenda.  I think next time some extra carrots are in order, because it seemed to be a little too much like a spice cake instead of a carrot cake.  Also, I wasn't crazy about the icing for this recipe. The orange flavor was way too strong and I guess I prefer a frosting as opposed to an icing, so I ended up making Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni on this site.

Great cupcakes. Adapted the recipe based on suggestions from other reviewer. When I made them, I used:
> 2 3/4 cup shredded carrots
> 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup applesauce
> 2.5 tsp cinnamon
> 1 tsp nutmeg
> 1/8 tsp cloves
> 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour

For the icing....I essentially cut the recipe in 1/2 but also tweaked the quantities of the chocolate, orange extract and confectioners sugar. Here is what I used:
2 ounces of white chocolate (left this as is even though I pretty much halved everything else)
4 oz cream cheese
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/8 tsp orange extract (used only a tiny bit to prevent overpowering)
1 cup of icing sugar (halved and then halved again as per other reviewers suggestions)
1 tbsp heavy cream

Great cupcakes. I made them for work and everyone loved them. They were easy to make and came out so moist. I doubled the recipe so I could make a dozen muffin sized cupcakes and made 6 regular sized cupcakes and still had frosting left over. The frosting was creamy with a lemony taste. I would most definitely make these again!

Made these yesterday and they were a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved them and I had tons of compliments - definitely a keeper!

Changes: I added 2 tsps of baking powder as well as the baking soda, and they rose just fine.  For the icing, I left the orange extract out, and I only used 3 cups of icing sugar.  It was perhaps slightly less thick than it should have been as a result, but it tasted amazing without being oversweet and was still plenty thick. 

Criticisms & Tips: I ignored the warnings about there being way too much icing because I suspected people might be going light on it, and I do like lots of icing on my muffins - nope, it was at least double what I needed, and I was heavy-handed with mine.  I will be making 1/2 batches of icing in the future - it will still be more than enough.
Also, while the white chocolate was definitely a nice touch, be careful to stir it lots and give it as little time as possible.  Use a double boiler if you have one - I burned mine (on minimum heat) twice before I got it right.

I would have loved to give these five stars, but the icing portion of the recipe keeps that from happening. The cupcakes themselves are delicious...dense, but not heavy; lightly spiced,not overbearing. I don't like cooked carrots at all, but when they're in cake, it's a whole different story! The icing, while not a disaster, makes way too much for the amount of cupcakes and is wasteful. I now have a big container of frosting left over and nothing to use it on unless I make more cupcakes. Also, there was not a hint of white chocolate, even though I *doubled* the amount after adding the called-for amount...STILL not a bit of white chocolate flavor. This is NOT a white chocolate frosting recipe, it's a cream cheese frosting recipe. If you go in expecting that, you'll be good to go. If you really want a white chocolate frosting, look somewhere else, but definitely give the cupcakes a try!

SO GOOD! The cake is wonderful, but the frosting is KILLER. I've only had a few experiences with carrot cake and none left me particularly amazed, but this recipe is great. That frosting is dangerous though. :) Thanks!

Very delicious and moist cupcakes! Just be aware that you only need to make 1/2 of the frosting! I made half recipe of the frosting and it was just the right amount to frost 12 cupcakes. I did double the white chocolate, but I still had trouble distinguishing that flavor in the frosting. Overall it's a great recipe - great cake, great frosting!

I made the cupcakes and icing exactly as reported and they were fabulous!  The only thing we didn't like was the orange extract was a little too much for our liking, but the icing is really good. Definitely cut the icing recipe in half.   The household loves icing, but we could barely use half of what was made.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I didn't make the frosting in this recipe because I didn't have the ingredients necessary to do it, I did a buttercream frosting from this site and it was fabulous on these! I did them following the recipe to a T with only one little change, I used haselnuts instead of walnuts again because that's what I had on hand... They are DELICIOUS! I am picking and choosing cupcakes and muffins to serve at my wedding reception and these are definitely on the list! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!
Just one little advice: the recipe starts with preheating the oven and beating the eggs... Don't. Start by grating the carrots and crushing the nuts, then crush the pineapple. This way you save time and don't have your oven running for a longer time than needed!

Great recipe.  Made these along with Dark Chocolate Bacon cupcakes from this site.  These were far better!  The icing is way too much.  I made 18 standard size cupcakes from this recipe (filled baking liners about 75-80% full) and had enough icing for 36, so next time I will cut in half or double cupcake quantity.  Carrot cake is my husbands favorite.  While he loved these, he did say that a few raisins in each and a bit more spice would make them perfect.  I loved the icing - especially the orange flavor: I did choose to use 2 oz. more cream cheese in lieu of the white chocolate and added finely grated orange peel to the top of the iced cupcakes.  It made clear to all that it was either carrot or orange flavored and added a bright orange accent!

Made the muffins from this recipe and the icing from the Carrot Cake III recipe as someone else suggested. These are TO DIE FOR! My husband was never big on carrot cake and I honestly didn't think he would even eat these, but he can't get enough!

In just reading this recipe, it should show the top ingredients to be frosting and to put aside.  Knowing some cooks (like my kids) who just mix everything together unless told otherwise!!!  Just a suggestion....

I've been making the same carrot cake for ages and decided to try this one solely because I had white choc. chips to use up and this frosting recipe was intriguing. The results were DELICIOUS. Hubby has requested this for his bday cake. I did not put the nuts into the batter, just put extra on the frosting.

I made these pretty much as-is. The only thing changed was that I used about 1/4 tsp lemon extract because I didn't have orange, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. The best thing about these cupcakes is that they were very moist, even a few days later. I doubled the cupcake part of the recipe but left the icing alone because of other reviews I read. It is a ridiculous amount of icing, which is a serious flaw with this recipe. I would have wasted a lot of icing had I not read other reviews. The other problem is the amount of sugar. I did not put the full amount of white sugar in the recipe, and they still tasted too sweet, especially with the icing! I plan on making these again, but I will try a healthier version with applesauce instead of oil, less sugar, etc for myself...but my family really loved these.

This is a wonderful cupcake!  I made these for my book club group and they loved them.  Several people have been asking for the recipe.  I added some coconut because I like coconut in my carrot cake but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Highly recommend!

These were excellent, very moist! The only thing I changed was I used another frosting.  I used the whipped cream with cream cheese frosting recipe on this website. Again, excellent, I will definitely make these again.

Very moist and flavorful.  I ate them as muffins without the icing and they were delicious!  Made 18 muffins, so I cooked for slightly less time (approx. 20 minutes.)

Really good! Right up there with Uncle Sam's from this site.  I used a different cream cheese icing without white chocolate (don't care for it) and I always add a bit of lemon juice to cream cheese icing, adds just a bit of tartness which is so good!!

I liked the recipe.  It was yummy but I have made better carrot cakes and the icing gave me some difficulty with melting the white chocolate.  But they were yummy and will get eaten up I'm sure.

These cupcakes were perfect. It was my first time baking, and I made them for my 2-year-old's birthday party and all the adults and the kids loved them - people couldn't stop raving. I made 3 separate batches instead of tripling the recipe - it was simple enough once I prepped the ingredients. I increased the cinnamon (2.5 tsp) & nutmeg (1 full tsp), and so they were nice & spicy, but not overpowering. They were definitely ready under 20 mins (probably more like 17 mins). I made them the night before, stored them in an airtight container at room temp, and frosted them the morning of the party. I did not use the icing here, but one which went perfectly and was enough to cover over 30 cakes. Leave some unfrosted for breakfast or morning tea! You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is a great recipe but I improved on it a bit. With these modifications it is totally a FIVE star recipe!  First, I used only 1C sugar, not 4, in the icing. Also the icing recipe needs to be cut in half, or just triple the cupcake recipe!  I also added 2 1/2C-3C shredded carrots in the cake, and just because i like nuts I added a few extra. The result was a spicy, moist, not too sweet carrot cake.  The icing isn't my favorite I think using just a simple cream cheese  icing would be better.  Anyway these were easy and fun to play around with.  In fact i'm headed to the kitchen for another!!

I must say that the frosting quite good, next time I may also use half the orange extract required.  It is good enough to use again.  This carrot cake recipe produces quite a tender crumb not oily like most, but I give it three stars because it was quite bland without the frosting.  I didn't have crushed pineapple and pureed some fresh pinapple that I had on hand.  I will try to make this again with the addition of coconut flakes.  I'm crossing my fingers for the next time I make this cupcake.

These turned out sooooo good!  Very yummy moist recipe!  We ate them w/o the icing....they were all gone before I had the chance to make the icing!  We're not big on nuts in our family so we didn't add them.  Plus, my batch made 25 muffins...not 12.  Perfect recipe...we'll be making these again!

Delicious frosting! I can only imagine how yummy the cupcake would have been based on how good the frosting was. :) My black bottom cupcakes were in SERIOUS need of frosting to make them visually appealing (although delicious, they are UGLY!!!). I've had my eye on this recipe for some time, but because I already have a favorite go-to carrot cake recipe, I never tried this. This frosting was mildly sweet and a perfect complement to my rich, indulgent cupcakes! Other than omitting the orange extract (I was on the lookout for a vanilla-based cream cheese frosting and didn't feel the orange flavor would pair well with my cupcakes), I made no changes. I'm SO gald I found this recipe! BAKERAMA, this was sinfully decadent! :-)

Everybody at work absolutely loved these cupcakes! They all thought I was a pro, but really I am not that experienced :). That goes to show how easy these are to make, and how good they turn out even if you are not very experienced! I cut the icing in half per other reviewers just so I would not have too much left over. The batter made about 16 cupcakes for me. I only changed two things: used half applesauce and half oil (I have seen that a lot in other recipes and thought I would try it, the cupcakes were really moist), and I forgot to buy baking soda, so I used baking powder, and doubled the amount written and omitted the salt (some website said this is the closest to getting to baking soda), and it still turned out just fine. I recommend this!

Awesome recipe! Huge hit with everyone. Made about 48 (medium sized) cupcakes, I couldn't believe it! I listened to everyone else, made single batch of icing, doubled the cupcake recipe. It was really moist! The icing I'm not sure if I'll make again, it was like biting into sugar, wasn't as creamy as I was expecting it. It was great anyway. Otherwise I made it exactly the way it asked. I drained the pineapple, seemed to work out well. Definitely will make again!

Excellent tasting muffin.  I substituted coconut for the walnuts also, so my children could take these to school.  Very moist, not too greasy.  The recipe for the icing makes an insane amount.  You could easily cut that in half.

This is the first time I made carrot anything and I'm very very very pleased with this recipe. I wanted to give this a 5-star but just the amount of icing that this recipe geared is ginormous! I already made about 50 cupcakes and I still have half of the original mix...    I served three types of this cupcake, one with generous amount of icing, one barely there icing and one bare. It was a very good decision because some of my friends aren't fond of icing, some wants a little and some wants to drink the icing!  Great stuff!

This recipe was fantastic.  Although i did change a few things.  I doubled the recipe, and instead of doubling the vegetable oil, i put 3/4 apple sauce and 1/4 vegetable oil.  I used one 8 oz can of crushed pineapples (drained + 3 table spoon of the pineapple juice) thinking i should had bought more, but they turned out great! I used currants in addition.  I also used the cream cheese frosting II from this site.  Making mini cupcakes is fun too, they're the perfect bite size!

These got rave reviews, but I used icing from Carrot Cake II as I prefer cream cheese. They were a bit tough to get out of the pan straight from the oven. I may try letting them cool in the pan first, then dumping them on the wire rack next time.

O.k. but not the best by any means.  The recipe makes a lot of frosting.  I don't get the white chocolate part because you really don't add enough of it to notice any white chocolate in it at all.  They didn't have enough flavor for me.  I would have added a little more of each spice.

I made this recipe with no changes- completely as is. Absolutely wonderful! I acutally made them for a cupcake tower I was doing for my niece's wedding. I was traveling 350 miles so I made them on a Wednesday and froze them for traveling. I defrosted Saturday morning  (the day of the wedding)and made the icing and decorated the cupcakes. The cupcakes froze beautifully and were very moist and delicious. As for the icing, my husband said "you can put that icing on cardboard and it would still be delicious!" Thank you! This is a keeper.

I love this recipe! I've used it at least 5 times since I discovered it about 6 weeks ago. It freezes great, both with and without the frosting so it's a perfect do-ahead recipe. I've adapted it to cakes of all sizes too, including a tiered cake for my sister's birthday. Both the cake and frosting got rave reviews at her party. Thanks so much for posting this!

Awesome, made them on P2, used real nutmeg and cinnamon, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. Didnt' use any pineapple or apple sauce, and they still came out killer.

This recipe is the best! I modified it by making it sugar free and reduced fat. I used Splenda (regular & brown sugar Splenda), crushed pineapple presweetned with Splenda, omitted the oil (added some pineapple juice instead), used I can't believe it's not butter (in the tub) and fat free cream cheese. Thank you for this great recipe!

Wow - very yummy!! I used half whole wheat/half white flour. Also half the  vegetable oil and half applesauce. These two changes make them a little healthier. I also baked at 325 degrees so as not to burn and watched until done. I made regular cream cheese frosting. They turned out delicious. Will make again and maybe add raisins. Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe sounds great and I'm eager to try it. My only concern is the pineapple. My family and I seriously despise the stuff. I was considering just leaving it out completely and following the rest of the  recipe as is. Only I don't want to go to all that effort to find that they're too dry. Has anyone tried these without the pineapple? Or can someone suggest an appropriate substitution to maintain it's moistness? Thanks!

Outstanding! Used jumbo muffin pans with jumbo paper cups and filled them filled slightly more than half way--baked to perfection. White chocolate cream cheese icing is superb. Served to picky carrot cake aficionados last night and they screamed about how great this dessert is! Many thanks!!

What is the purpose of Carrot Cake except to be a vehicle in which to eat cream cheese icing!!  Yes, it was a lot of icing, but the more the better on top of those yummy cupcakes.  I don't like white chocolate and I most definitely do not like orange flavorings in things, but this icing was to die for!!  My husband requested cream cheese icing for his birthday, he didn't care what it was on top of, and these were a hit!  I thought I might be throwing money away on that orange extract, but I will be making these again!

Fantastic hit at my party. I left the chocolate out of the icing, the orange flavoring came through just
enough to compliment the cupcake. Will definitely make again. They also freeze well.

I made this twice now and both time was a hit in my family and friends gathering.  The first time I made it I drained the crushed pineapple and it turned out good.  But the second time I made it I actually forgot to drain them and it turned out a lot better.  More moist.  For the frosting, I only used 2 cups confectioner sugar instead of 4 cups and it still turned out good.  I think putting all 4 cups will be way too sweet.  I also agree with some of the reviewers, the frosting is way too much for a dozen cupcakes.  I was able to use it for 25 to 30 cupcakes.

Delicious!  I didn't use walnuts or pineapple-added a half cup of unsweetened apple sauce to moisten them and they turned out very well.  For the icing, I didn't use white chocolate to cut the calories a little bit.  Added almond and vanilla extract to the icing and it was mouthwatering.  Great recipe!

These were awesome!  I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake, but was really craving some and these were perfect.  I'm a chocoholic and made these along with a batch of dark chocolate cupcakes for a party.  I preferred these hands down!  A VERY RARE occurance!  They were a huge hit with everyone.  Highly, highly recommend!

These are the BEST cupcakes!!! The proportions are perfect. So moist and delicious, perfect amount of spice. Great texture. Makes a TON of icing, though. I only used half. If these turn out flat for you, try adding baking powder in place of the soda- as I will next time. There isn't an acid in this recipe to activate the soda.

Disclaimer:  We had to make a few changes for our egg- and dairy-allergic four-year-old, who LOVED the end product.  We used Ener-G egg replacer and a vegan vanilla cream frosting with orange extract.  This cake was exceptionally moist and delicious.  Our carrots did turn green, which is apparently a reaction with the baking soda, so nothing to fear.  Our only minor complaint was that it was too moist/sticky to eat cupcake-style with fingers, which may be due to our necessary changes.  Yay for sneaking some veggies into a preschooler's diet!

these came out very moist and tasty. My only recommendation is that spraying the cupcake pan with grease made them stick to them. If I make them in the future I will be sure to use liners.

Took these to work and everyone raved about them - as others have said, it's a nice alternative to a dense, greasy cupcake. I halved the icing recipe also but in general would next time lessen the sugar and use less orange.

WOW these are great! I didn't understand how they could be both moist and light but they are the perfect mix of both. The frosting seemed a bit runny but it held up well after a little time in the refrigerator. I was worried that the cream cheese, white chocolate and orange would be too many different flavors but they are wonderful together. My family members were eating the frosting straight.

I made these for someone's birthday at work and everyone raved about them. They were very moist and delicious, and the frosting was a nice touch (although I couldn't taste the white chocolate much, the orange extract really added some pizazz!). Personally, I'm not really a fan of carrot cake, but these cupcakes were amazing! I will be making this recipe again.

Let me just say first that this icing would make just about anything taste good.  I love, love, love the hint of orange.  The cupcakes are great aswell.  Moist, fluffy, just as expected.  I did not use the pineapple because I didn't have any, but added some applesauce to make up for the moisture.  These rose up really big, so I think you could actually get a little more than 12 out of the recipe.  Will be taking these to the staff lounge at school, where I am sure they will be well received.

These are my go-to cupcakes for birthdays and other special occasions.  Everyone who tries one is completely wowed. The cake itself is flavorful and moist, but it's really the frosting that makes it spectacular.  This is hands-down the best frosting I have ever had.  I never even liked carrot cake until I made these!

Carrot Cake is my favorite kind of cake and this is one of the best I've ever tasted.  Not heavy tasting at all; nice, light texture.  The cream-cheese frosting is excellent with the addition of the white chocolate.
I used white chocolate chips in mine.  It does make a ton of frosting and I ended up freezing the leftover.  Next time I will either halve the frosting recipe, or double the cupcake recipe.  This made 19 cupcakes for me, not 12. 
This recipe is a keeper!

Melting the white chocolate is very difficult. Can't be done in a sauce pan. Look on line on how to do this. I ended up discovering my microwave oven has a melt butter setting and I used this with success, however was after an hour of trying to rig up a double boiler and burning the chips 3 times. I ended up using an entire bag before I got it right.

LOVED...LOVED.....LOVED THEM!!!    These were a huge hit at Easter.   Used coconut that I dyed green to put around them....... and for the coconut lovers in the family to munch on too!    I think they tasted even better the second day.

Yummy and will definitely make again. 
It came out perfectly with only a slight change: I skipped the heavy cream. The frosting would have been WAY too runny otherwise.
I made these gluten-free with gluten free all purpose flour and they tasted just as good. 
Thank you Bakerama!

These cupcakes were absolutely phenomenal! My boyfriend asked me to make them as they are his favorite, and having never baked or even tasted carrot cake before I was a bit apprehensive for him to taste them (he's an aspiring chef) but he LOVED them! They're so moist and not too sweet at all, the icing is perfect but the recipe does make a lot, so if you're looking to save ingredients I'd suggest cutting the icing recipe in half. I also added some cinnamon to the icing for some extra flavor and it complimented the cupcakes very well. I would recommend these to anyone, and they definitely changed my perception of carrot cake (which I always thought would taste like carrots)! Fantastic!

I made these for my son's 2nd Birthday party (I'm really not a fan of traditional cupcakes, so sweet & that icing - yuck!).  These were AWESOME.  So moist & the icing was fantastic.  I dyed the icing red & blue to make them Elmo & Cookie Monster (I added a pic), they turned out great although the icing didn't get the textured look you would from buttercream.  I didn't care, the taste was worth it.  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!!

After trying several carrot cake recipes I found this one to be the absolute best!  The only 2 things I would change is to sift the confectioners' sugar to make the frosting even creamier and add 1/8 tsp. of cloves to the batter. 
Served these at my granddaughter's first birthday party and everyone loved them.

I made these delicious cupcakes for a birthday party at my internship and everyone LOVED them!! I tweaked the recipe a bit. The end result had carrot cake "haters" fighting over the last cupcake. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be using it again soon :)

I just used the frosting recipe & made yellow cupcakes for a b-day celebration at work. They turned out Great! My co-workers loved them & yes it's true, there were leftover frosting. I didn't want to discard it, so I placed it in the refrigerator & made another batch of cupcakes the following week for my co-workers for another event. Yummy!

Great hit with my family.  Because the frosting is so sweet I was able to substitute applesauce for oil and half of the flour was whole wheat flour.  Still very moist. Love this recipe.

I haven't made the carrot cupcakes yet.  I did make the icing, and it is so good! Very easy to do.  I did not add the heavy cream(didn't have any on hand).  I think if you want a sturdier icing then add the heavy cream.  I used the icing to top off Zucchini Cake ll (from this site by Joan), and they are great together!  I did halve the icing and felt it covered the 9x13 cake well.  The icing is good to dip fruit in!

This cupcake recipe is amazing!  I've made it twice now with no regrets.  Shredding the carrots takes time (maybe it just took me so long because all I had was a lemon zester--that just makes it moister), but the end result is so worth it!  I did not use this frosting recipe, though.  I just made a basic cream cheese frosting that I piped on and then topped with some chopped walnuts.

This is my first review! I felt compelled to let folks know that this recipe is DELICIOUS. Very moist cupcake. Icing is amazing. I did double the white chocolate (the bar melted in my car) due to a previous review that they could not taste the white chocolate. I did make my icing the night before and stored in the fridge. When I piped it on the cupcakes it was a perfect consistency. Everyone at the party raved about them. And I am not a carrot cake fan. But will be making and eatting these again.

These were amazing...and a smash hit at various Easter weekend functions. I'm not a huge fan of raisins - and was glad to find this recipe didn't ask for them. The pineapple was a pleasant surprise and kept the cupcakes moist. I doubled the recipe and ended up with 30 or so cupcakes and drained the pineapple.

I had never made "from scratch" cupcakes or icing before and these were so easy and delicious. My coworkers were figthing over them. And my family loved them. Even my nephew who only eats chicken nuggets loved them. The recipe did make enough icing to generously frost 24 cupcakes but more icing just gave me a reason to make more cupcakes. YYYUUUMMMMM!!!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly. The only difference was that I doubled the recipe. And because the recipe called for a 1/2 cup oil already I didn't want to use 1 cup so I used 1/2 cup oil and they kept together just fine and tasted wonderful!! Everyone thought they were bakery bought!! The frosting makes a ton too so you could totally cut back on some of the ingredients as well.

The cake was very yummy but the frosting recipe was way to much for 12 cupcakes or a average cake.

These were so moist and delicious!  I made a regular cream cheese icing, and took out half the oil and put in 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I think I could easily cut out 1/3 of the sugar as well to make them more healthy...they are definitely on the sweet side.  But oh so good!

Very good! I only had 1oz. white chocolate and no orange extract, but the icing turned out fine any way. If the icing looks runny at first- keep mixing!

i wanted to give this recipe 5 stars, but i slightly changed this , and haven't actually tried how it's written here.  instead of nuts i used a mixture of golden raisins and currents, and i used just a cream cheese frosting instead of the white chocolate, but they are good without frosting at all!

Wow. These are great. Took a good bit of effort to make but my boyfriend (carrot cake lover) adored it. I noticed some other peoples observations...I agree about the orange extract. I used 1/4 tsp and it was great but just on the verge of making me think 'hmm should i have done a little less?'
ALSO****
I dont understand why the recipe tells you to make the icing first. I was really pressed for time here and i had plenty of time where it could have been made once the cupcakes are put in the oven. so my reccomendation is dont do the icing first. Otherwise, this recipe is amazing.

I only used the icing, and it was wonderful.  The hint of orange gave it a unique flavor.  I used it on an eggless chocolate cake for my son's 2nd birthday.

VERY good - but I did take the advice of other readers and only used 1/2 the orange extract and made only 1/2 the recipe of frosting.  Very good though - moist and delicious.

I give this a 4 just cause it was more of a spice cake rather then carrot cake. Still really good though. I followed the recipe and I also got 18 cupcakes not 12 and the icing is really good but made way to much, I could probably tripple the cupcake recipe to use all the icing.

It was really good.  I agree about cutting the icing recipe in half, but I filled the cupcakes to the top and they gave me FULL, pretty 12 muffin tops.

This recipe was a little longer than the ones that I normally try, however it was simply enough that I could follow it. One tip hide them so the children don't see them before dinner. My son loved these so much he ate two before dinner. The icing is incredible, soft and fluffy and not to sweet, loved it very much. I am not someone who normally likes to bake and this recipe has given me a new love for it. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe, although, I will have to agree with the previous comments regarding the icing. I would also strongly recommend halving the icing recipe, or doubling the cupcake recipe! I have an electric oven, and reduced the cooking time to 19 minutes, so they came out super moist. Also, I ommited the nuts, for decorating puposes, but noticed that it brought out a stronger orange flavor than I would have prefered. Next time, I will either add the nuts, or put in 1/4 tsp orange extract instead.

I also added pecans and raisins to the cupcake batter and pineapple to the icing and it turned out great that way.  The recipe is very moist but not too sweet like a regular cupcake.

Good muffins. Didn't make frosting. Reduced sugar in muffins to 1 cup brown, no white. Replaced baking soda with baking powder because there isn't any acid in the recipe. Didn't add nuts. Will make again.

Delicious recipe and almost identical to one I have used for many years. I did make just a couple of small changes...I added 1 tsp of baking powder to give them some extra lift.  I exchanged the walnuts for 1/2 c ground almonds, and used a standard cream cheese frosting instead of the white chocolate frosting in the recipe.  I made them for a friend for her birthday and to dress them up, I sprinkled edible gold flakes and white sugar pearls on the top - perfection!

I dont like giving such a poor review. These cupcakes smelt amazing but there is just too much moisture. It will cause these cupcakes to sink. Sure they are moist , but too moist. I cooked mine for an additional 5 mins and they still sank and were very non cupcake like. 
I tried this recipe twice to be fair, but nope. Id suggest cutting back on carrots by 1/2 cup and also pineapple and oil. OR upping the flour. This recipe can easily make 16+ cupcakes, maybe that would help them cook and dry up a bit. 
The Cream cheese frosting was good.. I used orange zest in place of extract. Will use the white chocolate and orange combo for my cupcake business.

Thanks for the recipe. The cupcake turned out moist and yummy but the icing was way too sweet for me. I replaced a cup of flour with wheat flour, replaced oil with apple sauce. I will make it again next time, but i will reduce the sugar by 1/3 - 1/2 for the cake, add some raisins to it and I will replace the frosting with cream cheese + lemon (with less sugar of course).

I don't bake much but these cup cakes came out amazingly good! And that icing was the best I've ever made and complimented the cupcakes perfectly!  Only thing that I would do different is cut the icing recipe in half (made way too much but it made me want to do another batch of cupcake batter) AND, I would add raisins (seemed like they were missing).

I made this recipe for my Easter dinner. My family love it. The only thing I did instead using 1/2 cup of oil I use 1/4 cup of oil & 1/4 cup of applesauce . Instead of 1 1/8 of sugar I use 1 cups trivia sugar. It was SO GOOD we love them . I going to my them again .

I have used and loved all recipes for years...this is the first recipe that I was completely disappointed with...didn't rise properly, so spread out beyond the muffin tins  and stuck to the edges even though they had  paper muffin cups. Checked the oven temp and it was fine...added ten minutes and got them cooked but the centres had dropped....the birds  and squirrels in the neighborhood got these muffins....has kind of broken a trust I had in all recipes...previously my experience has been good and I thought the recipes were checked carefully. Remade similar cupcakes from a Canadian Livingrecipe and they  we're perfect.

Outstanding!!! These cupcakes rival Sprinkles' in every way, and if you've had their cupcakes, you know that this is a huge prop! Super moist, with the perfect balance of spices. The only thing I did differently was using half butter and half oil. Since I was hoping to copy Sprinkles, I whizzed the pineapple for a few seconds break it down (didn't want bits of pineapple in there). I think that any cream cheese frosting would work with these. A+++++ recipe.

Omg. I loved this recipe. I gave it to my 5 year old and he is a picky eater. He ate a lot of the cupcakes. The best carrot cake I've ever had

I changed the servings to 24 so I could have 24 cupcakes but  I ended up getting 15 extra cupcakes that I didn't need or want! UGH!!!  The 39 cupcakes it did make were very tasty.

Just made this recipe (I had some extra carrot left over while making soup). I halved the recipe and replaced the pineapple with applesauce. Absolutely delicious. Formerly, I disliked carrot cake. Well, I've been schooled. This is amazing.

Yup, The icing was too sweet and i have a big bowl of icing left over. The cake itself id delicious. I used self raising flour and cut back on the baking soda a quarter of a teaspoon.. The cakes taste divine though....Perfect recipe for carrot cake and delicious icing but way too sweet for my taste.

Excellent recipe that you can modify easily to taste. Got excellent reviews from recipients. I made the following tweaks: doubled the batter recipe so frosting proportion was perfect;  used heaping teaspoons of the spices; threw in a scant 1/4 tsp baking powder in addition to baking soda; added in raisins; re frosting, I used about a cup less sugar and fresh lemon zest rather than the orange extract (didn't have any on hand). I made a 9x13" cake and 12 muffins. Cake took a bit longer to bake, but both turned out puffy, moist and delicious. That frosting recipe is KILLER--just adjust sugar to your liking. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

YUMMY! I doubled the recipe for the cupcakes and made 1.5 times the frosting. Ended up with 24 regular cupcakes and 40 minis. I had a little too much frosting, but not too bad.  They were absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing, and they are to die for! Nice change from my go-to cream cheese frosting. Can't wait to make them again :)

Cupcakes are FULL of flavor. Received a ton of compliments from people who said they normally do not care for carrot cake but thoroughly enjoyed these. I didn't make this frosting but followed a recipe from a cookbook (Serendipity, NYC) I had at home that was a bit simpler than this and it was a perfect pairing!

Hubby loves carrot cake and said "What did you put in these muffins?  They are awesome!"   I recommend cutting the frosting recipe in half.  I have enough left over to frost another entire batch (at least).

Ahh! Finally - perfect carrot cupcake recipe. I did not have walnuts, so I used pecans instead-chopped to the size of mini chocolate chips. Also, I squeezed out as the juice from the crushed pineapple. Thanks for sharing.

I had a LOT of icing left over, so next time I may cut the ingredients for the icing in half. Otherwise, everyone who tried these cupcakes after I made them LOVED them. I wasn't so sure about them at first, because the consistency of the batter was too runny when I made it, but it turned out pretty well. It took me a lot longer than 30 minutes to prep (more like 50 minutes), and less time to bake (more like 20 minutes). Will definitely make these again.

AWESOME!! I loved it, my teenage boys loved it! I followed the recipe exactly (made 15 cupcakes) but I did cut the frosting recipe in half and after frosting the cupcakes generously, I still had a couple spoonfuls left. :)  My frosting was runny though, and so I was not able to pipe it onto the cupcakes like the photo. :(  Not sure how to amend my frosting to make it thicker for piping. ???  When I make this again, which I definitely will cuz I'm sure my boys will ask me to, I will bake them in cupcake liners, as they were hard to get out of the pan even though I had greased it.

Amazing! I made them exactly as written and they were super moist and heavy, just the way we love them. The recipe does make way too much frosting, even with a heaping amount on the 15 cupcakes the recipe gave me.

Well, I have to say I'm very sad about these. My mom and I made these together today and followed the recipe exactly. The frosting is very tasty and turned out very nicely, but unfortunately we have nowhere to put it because the cupcakes themselves were a disaster!

About halfway through baking, we noticed they were sinking in the middle. We let them continue to bake and hoped it would resolve, but it didn't. They came out very soft, stuck to the liners, and were totally sunken in the center. I'd overfilled the muffin tins a bit so I thought that did us in, but we had enough extra batter to test that theory with another small batch, tins filled only 2/3 of the way, and they still sank and stuck to the liners.

Maybe I over-mixed the carrot and flour mixtures, but I really only mixed until everything was equally moist. Our oven temperature was just fine and I can't think of any other reason this would happen. I was trying to make these for my niece's birthday tomorrow, so I am very sad that these did not turn out well and that I absolutely can't figure out why.

I made the full icing amount and I wound up having just enough. I wound up piping the icing, which always means a lot goes to waste. 
I was concerned that the orange flavor was too much when I tasted just the icing, but it was perfect when paired with the cupcakes.
I also made some minis, and the baked for about 12 minutes.

Just came out of the oven! Smells great and after cooling frosted and put walnut crumbs on top. HIGHLY suggest cutting frosting down in half, I applied the frosting generously and still had a little bit left over. I didn't have orange zest but my husband said the frosting is the best he's ever had ( and he loves carrot cake). Overall, very pleased :)

This recipe is amazing!  I made it for Easter dessert and it was a huge hit!  It does make a ton of icing, but I just froze it!  In the future I would omit the orange extract, but that is just personal preference!

I only made the cupcakes and used store bought cream cheese frosting, but they were great and the batter was delicious too! The only change I made was to replace the walnuts with 1 cup of shredded coconut added directly to the batter. I also topped the frosting with shredded coconut and orange zest. The only issue was that these stick to the pan and are hard to get out so be sure to grease very well.

This is the best carrot cake ever! Everytime I make it people rave about it. I've had people pay me just to make it for them. Without it even being a special occasion!!

Absolutely amazing.  Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except halved the frosting amounts as per the advice of other reviewers.  Just the right amount.

These are really good, and the cream cheese frosting is amazing. I think the recipe could use a little less raisins.

I am giving it 4 stars because they fell in the middle, but it was probably my fault. We just moved, and I think my oven is too hot. Beside the point, they still tasted delicious! I plan on trying them again, but maybe with a little less ginger.

My first attempt at carrot cake anything met with fantastic results.  I loved them, my husband loved them - he asked me to make some for him to take to work - and my coworkers asked "When are you going to make some more?"  The answer:  Soon and very soon! :)

I love carrot cake and although I love baking for some reason I never made one. These cupckes were so good. I was hesitant about the orange extract but it added a very nice touch and I had huge compliments even from people who are not carrot cake lovers- they even asked for a take out bag with a cupcake in it!

Was a bit disappointed.  Didn't quite get that carrot cake flavor I was going for...kinda bland.  They did however turn out very well appearance-wise and as promised were very moist.  I used foil muffin cups to combat the greasy look.

Delicious!  My only complaint is that I couldn't taste the white chocolate or even the cream cheese in the frosting.  I feel like there's too much sugar.  Maybe next time I'll try cutting out a cup.  The cupcakes themselves were delicious and moist!  I used the smallest grate for the carrots, so it was time consuming to shred so much.  I think I might try carrot baby food next time.

My husband and I thought these were very good though I ended up with 18 cupcakes and probably should have made several more as some of them overflowed. I used my regular muffin tins with paperliners. The amount of frosting was just about right. Both my husband and I like just a little cake with our frosting. :o) Thank you for the recipe. It is definitely a favorite.

My friend asked me to make her carrot cupcakes with raisins and walnuts topped with creamcheese frosting. I attempted it worrying that they would come out not that well but I was wrong, these cupcakes were the most moist cupcakes I have ever made! They were so good and my friend ate all 12 by herself. Although this cupcake yielded 12 cupcakes, I ended up getting 15, but that just left some for me and my family to eat :). Definitely going to make this again. Also, when I used the crushed pineapples I poured it in with the pineapples so when the cupcakes came out they had little pieces of pineapples in them too. Simply delightful :)!

DELICIOUS cupcakes! I've made other cupcakes but never one with fresh vegetables/fruit in it. It was demanding for me but they were worth it! Amazing icing, I can't believe I made something so luxurious! Again, I think the icing made wayy too much for 12 cupcakes. I also found the icing made too early in the directions. It could have easily been made after the cupcakes and this way prevented it from hardening slightly (stirring fixed it). I loved the flavours but next time will mash the hell out of the pineapple since I got some chunks in my cakes.

These are so easy and awesome, made these for my birthday party and received so many compliments. I used the pre-shredded carrots cause I was short on time and they still tasted great. The frosting really makes the cupcake, it's also good on pumpkin muffins.

I followed the measurements and instructions exactly according to the recipe and these turned out fantastically delicious! Without the icing, the muffin itself would make a great carrot pineapple loaf. The icing definitely makes this a decadent treat. Even my extraordinarily picky two year old son loved these. I will definitely make this again, but I might try using only 3 cups of confectioners' sugar in the icing next time.

I don't personally eat carrot cake but I wanted a special treat for my dad's birthday so I took on the challenge of these cupcakes. He said they were awesome, but like others, you are left over with WAY too much frosting. But they sure did smell good in the oven!!

So my review is solely based on the icing, because after reading all the stellar reviews I used it for my favorite carrot cake recipe and OMG you people weren't kidding! This icing is PHENOMENAL! I'm sure the cake is too, :) maybe I'll have to try that next.

I am just rating the icing.  It is now going to be my "go to" for cream cheese frosting.  Wonderful flavor and easy to work with.   It does hold it's shape for piping, but being cream cheese and butter, it did start to get to get a bit too soft after it warmed up.  I made it a day ahead and re-whipped it the next day before using.

These carrot cupcakes are fantastic. I made them for an engagement party and there was not a single one left! I did not use the white chocolate icing in the recipe, but a cream cheese icing also from this site.

These were the best carrot muffins I have ever made!  I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I subbed it with pureed peach, and added some raisin.  The recipe gave me 18 muffins, so I frozen six of them.  I didn't make the icing, but I'm sure it would have been even better if I did.  Yummy!

Made double batch of cupcakes but same amount of frosting and still had excess as others mentioned.  Very tasty.  The shredded carrot and chopped walnut in the batter added texture.  I did not put walnut in the frosting because it seemed like overkill.  Only alternation was to add more cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger since I used fresh instead of powdered.  Spicy and delicious.

Great cupcakes! I used half the amount of sugar as the recipe said, as I usually do and they were still definantly sweet enough. I also didn't have any cream cheese so had them without the icing but everyone still loved them!

In one word decadent! Delicious, awesome......baked it in two 9" round cake pans, I loved the fact that this recipe only calls for half a cup of oil compared to two cups in other recipes...also definately half the recipe for the frosting unless you want to use it on something else.From now on this is going to be my only recipe for carrot cake . THANKS SO MUCH FOR SUMITTING YOUR RECIPE!

I made the muffins in advance of my husband's b'day, was going to freeze them and frost later.  Firstly, I must own "antique" muffin tins in that there was way too much batter to make only 12 muffins for the pan(s) that I own.  I used muffin tin liners and got 18 muffins.  With "filling" 18 liners, there was "spillage" during the baking process.  No mention was made in the recipe of how much batter should be put in the tins.  Filling the tins to the top was a mistake.   Anyone else using "antique"  muffin tins (12 - 2 3/4" diameter muffins/pan) should probably plan on filling the tins only about 3/4 full.  I was able to rescue the recipe by trimming the stuck-on "spillage" from the top of the tin with a sharp knife and then cooling on a rack as directed.  During my trimming process, I was able to taste test some of the "trimmings".  The muffin was very moist and quite flavorful.  I am anxious to add the cream cheese frosting and indeed determine if I "rescued" this batch.  Lessons Learned!

Very moist and soft muffin that's very easy to whip up. No cream cheese in France, so I used mascarpone cheese instead for the frosting. Omitted the canned pineapple and added extra carrots. To make up for the lost moisture and reduce calories, I substituted about 3/4 of the oil with orange juice. Had fun translating the recipe into French for my co-workers. Today I'm making it for my choir!

Made these for Easter dinner and everyone loved them. They are so moist and very tasty! I followed the cupcake recipe exactly, but for the icing I used orange zest instead of orange extract, and other reviews are right, the icing recipe makes way too much, I just cut the amount of confectioners' sugar by almost half. And for me the muffin recipe yielded about a dozen and a half nice size muffins.

This is a great carrot CUPCAKE recipe. Unlike the traditional carrot CAKE, this recipe yields fluffy, less dense, cupcakes. It has all the great flavors of a carrot cake but the texture is just lighter which is what I'd like for cupcakes. I've made this recipe a few times, the first time the spices were a bit too strong so from then on I would lessen the nutmeg and ginger just a bit. I have also made this with and without walnuts before, and even though I don't really like nuts, the cupcakes do feel like they are missing something without the nuts... I have yet to try the white chocolate cream cheese icing, and typically just use a regular cream cheese icing (I never seem to have white chocolate on me).  Overall, following this recipe will give you great carrot cake cupcakes and after making this one or two times, you'll know how to tweak certain things to match yours/others tastes. Great recipe, thanks!

I made these without any variation of the recipe.   I'm not a carrot cake fan but my critics told me the cupcakes were delicious but contained few too many nuts.  I did try one and saw their point; however, the flavor itself is mild and moist.  I did like it as much as I can like carrot cake.   I would've given this recipe 5 stars, but the frosting was the big disappointment for me.   I love cream cheese frosting and was very much looking forward to indulging, even making the full recipe knowing that it will produce more then I needed.  The texture, sweetness were all right.  It's the orange extract that threw me off.  It was way too overpowering.  I felt it cheapened the richness of this frosting.  Next time I'll put a drop for a hint of flavor or skip it completely.

I used this icing on red velvet cupcakes. I think I ate almost a quarter of the icing before I realized it. It was really good and not too difficult. It isn't a super stiff icing, so if you want to pipe it, it will take a little  additional confectioner's sugar. Next time, I'll try the icing with the carrot cake. Or maybe just the icing...

Oh My Goodness!!!!  Look no further than this recipe.  I made these for work.  They were awesome.  I had folks asking me for the recipe like crazy.  One girl stated that they were the best cupcakes she had ever had.  She took some home for her two young sons and husband to rave reviews from all.  The icing is delish.  Beware - it makes a lot.  I doubled the batter batch and made a single batch of icing.  Still had extra.  Yummy Yummy Yummy

first time i made these i used 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. applesauce.  they oddly turned out extremely oily and sticky...maybe they werent completely cooked.  great flavor though.  the second time i used 1/2 c. applesauce instead of the oil and they turned out great.  i used pre-shredd carrots and if i were to make them again i would still chop the carrots more.  the icing is fantastic with the orange flavoring!!  i will use that recipe alone for other things.  but the batch of frosting makes a ton - you could triple the carrot cupcake part and still have some left over.  all in all, it was a great tasting recipe, but i do have to say that there were alot of flavors going on-pineapple, carrot, orange, etc.  thank you!!

I don't like anything with carrots, so I didn't eat these myself, but I'm reviewing it based on the raves I got from the picnic I took them to. I halved the icing recipe, and still had quite a bit left over, and I forgot to add the heavy cream, but the frosting was still delicious! I also got feedback on how moist they were. The only strange thing was that some of the carrots turned green - apparently that sometimes happens to carrot cakes. Anyway, thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I did not try the frosting, but it sounds wonderful.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the 1/2 cup of oil.  I got 18 cupcakes out of the recipe and baked mine 18-20 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe, my family loved it!

These are amazing!!  I made them along with 3 other flavors of cupcakes for a birthday party and these were the first to go.  Not too sweet and the tops were a little crunchy which gave great texture!  I added the confectioners sugar slowly and to taste.  I did not use all that the recipe called for and I think it would have been way to sweet had I used all of it.  After I iced them, I sprinkled the the tops with cinnamon and garnished with white chocolate shavings.

A Great traditional carrot cake recipe.  I modified the topping though... I forgot to use the heavy cream and used a 12oz bag of white chocolate chips. Still very good, but needed  to refrigerate for about 1/2 an hour to get the right consistency.

Delicious and moist. To make them a little healthier, I used apple sauce instead of oil and cut back on the sugar. Didn't try the cream cheese frosting.

Oh so yummy....we did omit the icing because my daughter wanted plain vanilla frosting instead of cream cheese. She is nine and made these cupcakes all by herself (with my assistance). The carrot cupcakes were delcious! We got 18 beautiful cupcakes out of this recipe and they were worth every calorie. Loved these for Easter. Thanks for a great cupcake!

These are amazing!  I work in a HS and brought them for my students and co-worker and they LOVED them.  

The icing is fantastic, I used it for choc. cupcakes and substituted Raspberry flavoring for orange and it was perfect.

Made these for my mom's birthday, since carrot cake is her favorite. I did not try the cupcakes, since carrot cake is not my favorite. However, my Mom, Dad, Husband and oldest son thought they were delicious. I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe found on this site. Thanks for a good Carrot Cake recipe. I can now make my Mom's birthday a little more special by making her a homemade carrot cake instead of a boxed one.

Delicious recipe. I followed the cupcakes and the icing recipes exactly and they were so good. One note, this yielded 18 not 12 cupcakes and the icing had a LOT left over. I made this for the adults after trick or treating while the kids dug into the candy. I can't wait to have another one for breakfast. Good recipe.

I only used the cupcake part of this recipe and instead of cupcakes I made a cake. I substituted apple sauce for the oil like another user suggested. I also cut the sugar in half but, I usually do on most recipes (I am not too fond of really sweet foods).
It came out okay. It is not something I would make again but, I could eat it. In other words, it wasn't anything special for me. Sorry!

Yum!  These were so moist and tasty!  I didn't have vanilla and I omited the ginger, I also skipped the frosting (plenty of calories as is :) I used the silicone muffin pan.  I think it makes a big difference in the overall turnout.  My family ate these up in one night!!

I  cut the frosting recipe in half but forgot to decrease the orange extract. It wasn't overwhelming but I would have preferred a more subtle orange flavor. I did add half a cup more shredded carrots because of reviews saying it wasn't carroty enough. Next time I will allow time to put the frosting back in the fridge to set up some...I let my cream cheese really soften & the frosting didn't have as much body as I would like.  Great recipe...thanks!

Excellent! I was looking for a new recipe similar to one I used to rely on, and this has all the 'right' ingredients for a carrot cake.  I definitely reduced the sugar, to just under a cup, and used applesauce to replace the oil and they turned out terrific. I ended up using just a standard cream cheese icing recipe, which paired nicely.

Made your cupcakes without the frosting. Had no pineapple but added flaked coconut. Made a butter/brown sugar/cinnamon topping for some of them. Iced some of them with my cream cheese frosting. Two buckled in the middle so I melted up some cream cheese and brown sugar and blended in raisins and filled those ones. They look and smell awesome. Taste testing once they harden a little.

I made this using a Mini Cupcake pan and they came out so cute! The cakes were delicious and I got rave reviews from family. I did not use the white chocolate cream cheese icing, instead I used a different cream cheese icing, but they still came out great.

Half the recipe for the icing, that will be enough to frost the cupcakes.  These were super moist and delicious, everyone loved them.  Next time I might try adding some dried cranberries or raisins, that might be a nice touch.

Like a lot of other people, I found that this recipe produced twice as much icing as was necessary. These cupcakes turned out delicious and I got wonderful remarks from them, namely that they were the best they had ever tasted.

Very good.  I agree with all the others: there is two times as much frosting as cake mix, and the yield is about twice what is described.  I was able to use the extra frosting on a chocolate cake so it worked out.

These are fantastic, the cake is incredibly moist. The only thing I would change is I would add more cream cheese to the frosting and less of the white chocolate, it was a little sweet for me.

So moist and flavorful! I didn't have white chocolate on hand for the frosting so I made a regular cream cheese frosting, next time I will try this frosting. I made them for church as it was my turn to bake. I made 100 mini cupcakes and they were all gone!

I've made this recipe many times, it is fabulous!! I always get many compliments when I bring it to potlucks. Every time I make it for a big gathering, I double the recipe, and make mini cupcakes, it usually makes around 60 mini cupcakes, or 48 mini and 12 regular. When I double it, I only use 2 cups of sugar, I leave out the ginger and don't put the walnuts (allergies). I usually do double the icing, but never put the full amount of sugar. For a doubled icing recipe, I only use 2 cups of sugar, and it's sweet enough. The other thing is, the white chocolate in the icing clumps up and it's hard to pipe out of a decorating tip, it gets stuck. That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars, otherwise, it's great!! Definitely a keeper!

Wonderfully decadent.  My tween made these. Excellent quality cake.  The white chocolate icing was fantastic and complimented the cupcakes well.  Not quite a true/typical  chocolate taste as one would think, so know worries in adding this to the cupcake.

Bomb-diggity! I tripled the recipe for a bake sale and it yielded 60 but I ended up with way too much frosting so I would double not triple the frosting. Will definitely make this again in a cake pan for Easter. I’m going to tweak the frosting with less orange extract and more white chocolate because the orange taste was there but not the chocolate. That’s not a bad thing though, it was all good and they sold like hot cakes at the bake sale! Thank you so much for sharing.

The cupcakes were good, but the instructions were a little confusing. The way the person wrote it made it where i had to open two tabs to look at everything. Other than that the cupcakes were delicious. The cupcakes were fluffy but dry. And had a lack of sugar. But the icing was really sweet and creamy. They were two perfect mixtures! They worked well together, and they had everybody I made them for wanting more. I definitely make them again!

This recipe makes way too much frosting for the 12 cupcakes.  The cupcakes were delicious!

This frosting paired so well with yello me cake cupcakes topped with a raspberry. I did only use 4 oz of cream cheese and excluded  the orange extract. I will use it again.

This is a very simple, light, moist recipe that I will use again.  I loved the frosting and the orange tang flavor.  Just a perfect carrot cake!

I made  this  for  the 1st time on thanksgiving; and it was perfect, an instant hit!!  For Christmas it was slightly too moist, I think  I added to much juice from the crushed pineapples.  I didn't drain when I added the crushed pineapples  to  the  mix, and then I also added a couple of spoonfuls of juice to the mix....but it was still devoured.  For the next cake ,I just added the crushed pineapples un-drained and it was perfect.  Now I have been asked to bring this cake every time I go over anyone's house.  I am not a baker, so I appreciate how easy it is to make!!   I have been told this is the best Carrot Cake ever!!!

Very good. Easy to make and tasted great. I had enough left over to make a total of 20 cupcakes. 

I did not use the icing in this recipe but I used another one I found on this website (chocolate allergies).

Since I frosted all the cupcakes, I put the remainder in my fridge in a cupcake holder. The next afteroon I ate one (kids at school) and it was just as moist as it was the day before. We ate on them as dessert for 3 days and they stayed moist in the fridge. 

Usually, cakes and cupcakes become dry and hard. But not this recipe. I'm making more next week for a potluck :)

I spaced out at the end and forgot to add the walnuts, but the cupcakes were delicious! The batter looked suspiciously wet and heavy, but perhaps that is normal for carrot cake. Following tips from other reviews, I filled the liners much higher than I normally do for other cupcakes, baked at 400F for 8 minutes, then 350F for 10 minutes to encourage doming. They were still on the flat top side but looked respectable enough. There was icing leftover from another recipe, but I'll try this one next time because it sounds delicious!

Made them for a shower at work and everyone loved them.
I didn't have nutmeg and it was still very good. Next time I will definitely put less sugar, maybe 2/3 of what the recipe says.
Frosting does make a lot so do only half of it, that is plenty.

I made these for a co-worker's birthday and received rave reviews! My cupcakes did sink in the middle which was disappointing, but I think I may have over mixed the batter. I will definitely be making again!

These are very good. I used applesauce instead of oil and I used 4 leftover egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I did not use the frosting because I had some of my own to use up, so I can't comment on that.

These were okay, but I wouldn't make them again. I've been cooking and baking for three decades, so I know what I'm doing. Followed the recipe (minus nuts) and got batter for 22 cupcakes.  They rose just over 1/4" in the oven. Moist and very sticky, even in greased silicone cups. Cakes had a dense, spongy texture and a tendency to stick in your teeth. They were tasty, but didn't taste like carrot cake,  almost more like zucchini bread.

Delicious! This recipe yielded 24 cupcakes for me. I filled the liners 3/4 full and got the perfect amount of batter and generous helpings of icing on each one. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 cup of sugar in the batter I used 3cups of powdered sugar in the icing. The white chocolate made the taste richer and the consistency screamer. They quickly disappeared at the party I took them to. I will definitely make these again. Thank you for sharing.

These are delicious!  The only change I made was  adding  chopped raisins for a little more sweetness because the recipe doesn't call for much sugar.    I made the cream cheese frosting without adding the white chocolate, because I didn't have any on hand and it turned out just fine.  I did have to add more heavy cream to get the frosting light and fluffy though.    I left some of the cupcakes unfrosted so I can enjoy them for breakfast.

Recipe quantities made exactly 12 muffins. I used only 1 cup of brown sugar (no other sugars) and it turned out fine. I did not use the icing recipe, as i wanted a classic true cream cheese icing. Will save this recipe and make again. EDIT: Takes 30 mins to bake a cake. Recipe makes 1 cake pan

I'm giving these cupcakes 5 stars because they taste awesome. The only thing I changed was the amount of oil,  used half the oil and the other half was applesauce. I drained the pineapple to get rid of some of the juice since the applesauce adds the moisture it needs; I didn't want runny batter. I made half the recipe for the icing as other reviews suggested, and I used a cup of confectioners sugar since I don't like icing to be too sweet. They came out super!

I burned the white chocolate on the first try, but then I used a bowl in a pot with about 1 inch of water to make a bain-marie and that worked fine.  I substituted pureed apple for crushed pineapple.  The icing came out great but it was much more than I needed to ice the cupcakes.  I decorated them in a valentine theme instead of with the chopped walnuts and used only half the walnuts the recipe called for.

These. Are. Perfect. Moist and fluffy. They rounded great with out overflowing. I got 17 cupcakes out of the recipe.  Several reviews state that there is way too much frosting but I completely disagree.  I frosted all cupcakes and had maybe 1/2 cup left. There was no waste. This frosting is so delicious I ate the rest. My client that I made them for is absolutely in love with them.  I would give this recipe 1000 stars if I could.

Great recipe. Not sure  that the white chocolate really adds much. I substituted pecans for waluts and zest of 1 medium orange for orange extract and it came out great. I'd use a little less orange zest next time but it was still wonderful.

As many others have said, the icing is overkill. Unless you really like to pile on icing, you can cut it in half. I made a double recipe of cupcakes and it was a perfect amount of icing for my taste.

Orange extract dramatically changes the taste of the icing. I am a newby at baking sweets so had I known the orange flavor would be so prevalent I would not have added it. It was too late and I had doubled the recipe so didn't want to start over. Side note: Doubling the recipe and making 32 cupcakes out of that, I still have a huge tub of icing left. I would recommend cutting icing in half. I would try almond extract next time. I haven't seen any others call for orange in the same icing recipe.  Otherwise it is a FABULOUS recipe and I got many compliments! I would definitely make this again!

Well they did turn out rather flat as someone else had mentioned. Plus, they're falling apart really easily. But on the plus side, they taste great. Raisins should def be added if you're a fan.

This recipe is amazing! If you are decorating your cupcakes (not just frosting with a spatula or knife), make the full frosting recipe. I colored half the frosting orange and used a start tip to pipe fox faces on my carrot cupcakes and used all the frosting.  I used chocolate chips for eyes and noses.

I decided to make these cupcakes because my boyfriend likes carrot cake and I thought cupcakes would be easier to transport. First thing is as all the reviews saying do 1/2 frosting is 100% correct. A full batch of frosting would drown the cupcakes. Also if you are using a convection oven be very careful to not let the cupcakes burn. Instead of 350 I set the oven to 325 and set a timer for 20 minutes instead of 25.  Even 20 minutes was too long fortunately I accidentally set the oven time to stay on for 15 minutes and when I took it out it was done but not burnt. Finally some reviews said it did not rise well, I attempted to combat this by using baking powder and self rising flour. It rose slightly but remained rather flat which was why I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 star. Overall very good mild flavor, need to find a way to combat lack of rising.

My sister made those for my birthday as I had showed her the recipe. It did not disappoint. We loved it... I had 1+ 1/2 (Yum!)
Yet, she said she had too much cake batter(!?) and could have made 18 smaller size cupcakes. She also found the white chocolate icing too sweet and diluted it with whip cream(?). I tasted the intact icing and the diluted one(!??!) both awesome. Note that nothing is ever too sweet for me, but CAN BE too 'fat'. With all that icing, you can easily cut oil to a half and pull out a decadent treat just the same. Will redo this one. 

BTW Not everyone is fond of orange flavoring (My niece did not like it) stick to vanilla if you have picky eaters.

I made only the icing - we have special chocolate cupcakes I wanted something different for them.  This is LOVELY icing!  The texture was perfect without the cream, but I wanted to use it, so we just added more sugar, and had leftovers for brownies another time.  I was out of orange extract, substituted Grand Marnier liqueur.  Delicious, soft and creamy, set up well.

I loved these carrot cupcakes. The recipes for white chocolate frosting makes a LOT so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the cupcakes. It made enough frosting for all of the cupcakes to be frosted generously. If you don't want to double the cupcakes, you should definitely cut the frosting recipe in half.

Update- I made these again using gluten free flour and crushed pineapple with juice. For some reason the batter was very foamy (maybe the pineapple) and runny. When the baked they got really spongey and the carrots, pineapple, and nuts all rose to the top until it was pretty much dense pound cake with carrot streusel. Very delicious but weird turnout. I also used lemon oil/extract instead of orange in the frosting and it was possibly even better that way!

These are divine! Before these I made the Carrot cake III recipe. They're almost the same...but very good! They don't grow much, but just enough. Half the frosting is enough.

This recipe makes way more than it says!!!  I needed 48 for a work party, and ended up with 64 cakes, and a giant bowl of frosting. More like  16 cakes per recipe, and you will only need 1/2 the frosting.

This is a fantastic carrot cake!  The cake is moist and full of flavor, with a nice light crust on the top to give it more texture.  I follow the cake recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly.

As for the frosting, I haven't tried it because I'm not a big fan of cream cheese frostings--just a personal preference.  I can attest that the cake also pairs deliciously with a basic butter frosting (butter, vanilla, salt, confectioner's sugar, milk).

This is one of my favorite carrot muffin recipes. I make one substitution: instead of 1/2 cup oil, I use 1/4 cup and complement it with 1/4 cup homemade applesauce. This helps me control both fat and sugar in the final product. The result is a light, flavorful muffin that's not too sweet or oily.

Very dense and moist, with great flavor that is not too sweet.  I left out the pineapple and the nuts, and substituted a quarter cup of chopped raisins.  I made a standard cream cheese frosting instead of the white chocolate cream cheese frosting, and it went really well with these cupcakes. My family inhaled them!

I made this recipe for Easter dessert. I didn't make the frosting though ( I homemade my own cream cheese frosting.) They were a hit! I followed the ingredient amounts and directions as they were written and it turned out perfectly. They made about 15 cupcakes. The only thing that I would recommend is cooking the cupcakes for about half of the time that they said to. I put the cupcakes in for about 6 minutes then flipped the pan around to cook for another 6 minutes. They should be slightly underdone, then once you take them out of the oven, the cupcakes will continue to cook on the inside. They will turn out more moist this way. Once they are all the way cooled down, then you can add the frosting on top. If you want the cupcakes to be more on the dryer side, then yes I would say leave them in there for the time suggested in the recipe. I will definitely make this again!!!

I didn't make the icing but really enjoyed the cake recipe leading up to Easter.  I used the batter for donuts in a donut maker and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  I also used for breakfast muffins and topped with a cinnamon streusel topping.

Won't make this one again. The flavor was pretty good but the texture wasn't. It was sticky and didn't rise like a fluffy cake. The edges stuck to the pan and the tops fell.

I've made this recipe twice, and both times I did not make the frosting. The frosting is too rich for my taste. But the cupcake is really good. The first time I added the pineapple to the batter, but omitted the ginger. The second time I didn't add pineapple, cut back on the oil to one-third cup, but added the ginger. Also I added a cup of nuts to the batter both times. I am not a fan of crunchy frosting. 
The next time I will decrease the ginger (not a fan), or use freshly ground ginger, and increase the oil to one-half cup, as directed in the recipe.

The icing is delicious! Beautiful color and easy instructions. I didn't bake for 25 minutes. I baked for 20 and the outside was just starting to get dry. So, I'll bake for 18-19 minutes next time. Wonderful flavor! Made it a second time to give as a gift. These are sooooo yummy! Adapted my time and they are perfect.

Yummy!  Made it exactly as directed (barring cutting icing recipe in half).  While I've had better carrot cake (but not by much), the icing was so wonderful that it brought the whole thing up to a five star recipe.  Made it for my husband's birthday and his comment was that this is our "go-to icing for everything" from now on.  It made me 18 cup cakes that were perfectly iced with a half recipe.  Will definitely make again.  
I can totally see using the icing as a base recipe and substituting alternate flavors in for varying recipes.

Dellicious recipe, moist and bursting with flavor. Only 4 stars because the ingredients for the icing make twice as much as what is needed. I added orange rind instead of orange extract, and coconut instead of walnuts, it was fabulous!

Cupcakes came out just great! I wasnt sure about mixing the flour mix until the end, so I mixed the sugar-oil-eggs mix with the flour mix before I folded the carrots-pineapple. They have a nice body, crust and puff. I made the regular Cream cheese frost because I had no white chocolate neither orange extract, so, butter, cream cheese, vanilla and conf sugar. Jumm

This is the second time for this recipe. The first time I made as is, and as commented by others, the frosting was enough for a double recipe.  I repeated today only in two round cake pans. Still way too much frosting between the layers and on top, but sure was a hit with the family!

Great recipe.  I used muffin liners and I believe it yielded about 16 average sized moist muffins.  Iced them all and had lots of leftover icing.  They were a hit!

Beautiful recipe,  be sure to add the walnuts as they make a lovely texture - I doubled the recipe and it made 36 beatiful, full sized muffins.
The muffins can be made with vanilla essence as a substitute to vanilla extract which is far cheaper to buy, however using vanilla extract does make a more luscious, rich batch.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I thought the frosting could be improved. Unlike other reviewers I don't think it made too much. But it was much too sweet and the white chocolate was just an extra step that didn't really enhance the flavor. It was lost because of the orange flavor. I like my cream cheese frosting to have more tang. I only added three of the four cups of powdered sugar and I still thought it was too sweet. I'm not sure about the orange flavor either. It was a little different, but I'm not sure if it's really necessary. The cupcakes themselves were delicious, moist, and flavorful. I baked them at 325 for about 25 minutes in a dark pan. I try not to bake cakes/ cupcakes at 350 because they can get dried out. Overall, I think this recipe is worth saving because of the cake part.

Very moist & delicious. I cut back the white & brown sugar because the pineapple is already sweet.

The flavours are just bursting in this recipe. Extremely well reviewed by my guests. However, the basic recipe is way to sweet. I essentially reduced the the sugar level by 1/3 for the batter. There was too much icing the first time so I halved the recommended amount using low fat options for creamed cheese and heavy cream. I also used just one tablespoon of icing sugar and one table spoon of sugar substitute. Icing came out delicious with a little less guilt. I'll would've given it 4 stars if the standard recipe wasn't that sweet.

I followed this recipe to the letter and I got way more than twelve cupcakes! 21 to be exact! If I would've filled them any higher they would've spilled over he top! The recipe is delicious though I must say.

Sooo after reading a ton of the reviews I just decided I would follow the recipe exactly. I even watched the video (which I never do). I have to say I'm very happy I did! The cupcakes are very moist I do wish it had more flavor though. Also I did NOT cut the icing recipe in half and I'm very glad I didn't!! I used an icing tip to decorate the top and was left with very little icing. For the reviewers that were left with a ton, it's probably because they just used an off set spatula. If you like to use a tip like me you'll need the full recipe.

Made these for my daughter's 23rd birthday. She hates "regular" cake.  They were a SUPER big hit! Her father, my ex, said, "Best cupcakes I've ever eaten."  The frosting is the trick.  And I really loved it that the cupcake liners didn't get oily from this great recipe.

This is my second review on this great carrot cupcake recipe. Last time I didn't notice my walnuts turning black in the batter. I searched it and apparently it's a reaction with the baking soda. My walnuts looked like raisins! I found some solutions on the Internet including coating the walnuts with flour before adding it to the batter. But I was thinking, since baking powder has cream of tartar in it, which makes the batter more acidic, it might be better to use baking powder instead of baking soda. 
Thanks for this great recipe!

Made as described but only made 1/2 of the frosting (which was plenty!). I made mini cupcakes - baked at 350 for 15 minutes. Filled the batter apps 1/4 inch from the top. The carrot cake is so moist and delicious! The frosting is soo good!

My Husband loved these and brought them to work and I had tons of compliments.  I might add more white chocolate but this recipe is great!    I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup but next time I will do a full cup. I used orange juice instead of the extract and cut the icing sugar down to 3 cups.   I love that the icing has white chocolate in it for something totally different and interesting!

Amazing!  I've never had a better cupcake, so moist and full of flavour! I brought these to work and people are still talking about them; had many request for the recipe and I told them they could find it here! The recipe was easy to follow and since I don't consider myself a good baker, this was great for me! There was a lot of icing, almost too much, but better too much than not enough :-)

These turned out very good.  I thought the orange extract was a little out of place in the frosting, but this was more of a preference thing.

It was amazing!!!! I added  1cup of raisins to half the batter (so some of the cupcakes had raisins). I also toasted coconut in the oven and topped a few of the cakes with the coconut after frosting. 

They were a hit!!!!

I was so incredibly excited to make these for my birthday, and I was not disappointed!  The cupcake was perfect (although I omitted the nuts for allergy reasons) and the frosting was by far the smoothest I had ever attempted.  The frosting was a little too wet to be perfect, but I think cutting the cream added in the end in half will fix that without sacrificing the creamy texture.  All in all, a keeper!  One for my "favorites" notebook. :)

I made this today.  I didn't have the crushed pineapple so decided to substitute it it applesauce. It's still moist and as what others have said crunchy at the outside.  It's so delicious.  I am never a big fan of Icing so I just made the cupcake and still amazing!! Love it, thanks for sharing this recipe :))))

The cake was very moist!   I did not put the white chocolate or orange extract in the frosting, didn't have them on hand.  Also reduced the powdered sugar by about 1/2.. just didn't want it that sweet.  Therefore, only needed a splash of milk (didn't have cream), to thin it... rather than 2 T.   I subbed the pineapple for applesauce (just don't like pineapple in my carrot cake).  Used pecans instead of walnuts.  I also used more like 2 1/2 -3 cups shredded carrots.  They were tasty and everyone really like them!

Was very good. I put a simple syrup on the cupcakes after they baked. Then, we ate them as a type of spice muffin. No icing needed.

So yummy! I did make changes though... reduce white sugar to 1 cup (it was still very sweet.. I'll try 3/4 cup next time), traded RUM EXTRACT for the vanilla, ADDED 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, (and used the BEST cinnamon .. SAIGON cinnamon), and omitted the walnuts. I baked for 25 minutes and they were soo moist :D they didn't need the topping.. a good stand alone cupcake! DEF MAKE AGAIN!!

Absolutely fabulous! I have adapted at times to include coconut and/or raisins in the batter, and lemon extract instead of orange in the icing.  A favorite recipe for sure.  Thanks Bakerama!

This cupcakes are just delicious! So moist and yummy, all my family loved them and I am planning preparing them for my baby´s first birthday. 
The only thing I adjust was the amount of sugar by suggestion of the other reviewers but are by far my new favorite cupcake. :)

The white chocolate frosting is way too sweet.  I remade some with lemon cream cheese frosting and it was much better.

The cupcake itself was just okay. I did love the frosting though!  I used half the amount of sugar as the frosting recipe calls for.  Based on other reviews, I made a half batch of the frosting, but found that I didn't have enough!  I used a piping bag, so maybe the amount of frosting is proportioned for that?  Or maybe I'm just some sort of frosting fiend  :)

This was an amazing recipe! I was a little nervous trying out a new recipe to bring to an Easter party but it was a huge hit!!!!!
I cut the frosting recipe in 1/2 & it was just enough. I also used melted white chocolate chips about 1/2 cup. And I completely eliminated the orange extract cause I didn't have any.
I did the cup cakes exactly as written except I didn't drain my pineapple & I accidentally added the entire cup of nuts to the batter & it was still good! Baked for 20 minutes & they were moist & delicious!

This was the first time ever making carrot cake/cupcakes and they came out great. I shared with friends and they loved them too. I did use another cream cheese frosting recipe from this site but the cupcakes themselves were awsome. Will be making again soon!!!

These are very good. Did not have orange extract, so I used lemon.  Still very yummy. I made six large cupcakes, so I had to cook them a little longer too.

Absolutley loved this recipe.  I used Lemon extract instead of orange because I couldn't find any orange extract.  Next time I make it I won't put any walnuts inside the cupcakes I found 1 cup walnuts was way to much.  Other then that it was soo good and everyone loved them!

I ABSOLUTELY love these cupcakes. they're moist and stay moist for a few days. I do agree with the others that the amount of icing is waaaay to much for the amount of cake made. I doubled the cake and kept the icing the same and I still could have made another batch of cake (doubled the recipe). The icing was simply delicious. I've searched long and hard to find a cream cheese recipe that was not too sweet and not too cheesy. This is definately it!

Very moist and yummy!  This recipe was easy to make and gone in a flash.  I did not get a chance to make the frosting but without it they are a great breakfast treat!  I am going to make this one often.

Only made the cupcake. Used applesauce instead of pineapple.  Didn't have any walnuts.  And substituted 1/4 c of wheat germ for 1/4c of flour.

this is actually a review for the icing- AMAZING!  I already have a carrot cake recipe that I use but I wanted to try a different icing.  I'm not even a huge fan of cream cheese icing but this was SO GOOD!  My neighbors all raved too.

I made a double batch of cupcakes and a single batch of frosting.  I had extra frosting left over so I put it in the freezer.  The next week I made one batch of mini-cupcakes - baked for about 13 minutes - and used the rest of the frosting. They are very good carrot cupcakes even without the frosting.  You could just make a batch of mini-cupcakes and treat them like little muffins.  They were a hit with adults and kids.  I made them as written, except I cut the nutmeg in half because I don't care much for nutmeg.

The carrot cupcakes were great! (: I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe as recommended, but it didn't taste cheesy enough. So I will increase the proportion of cream cheese the next time.

This recipes was a huge hit on Father's Day. The icing was a little heavy on the orange extract, but otherwise, the cake was moist and flavorful and the icing was the perfect level of sweet.

The cakes were good, I was however disappointed with the frosting.  It was much too orangey for my taste and so I made another creamcheese frosting recipe from the site listed below and added a bit of cinnamon to it to go with the carrot cake, everyone loved them!

Very good. I made a few adjustments due to laziness and affordability. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe which was quite good. I also didn't use any nuts because I don't have a bulk store by my house and they're too expensive by the bag. I would recommend using the walnuts though. I think it would be even greater with the addition of them.

This is a great recipe. I really like the icing recipe. I did not not add the heavy cream or orange extract - didn't have it at home or have the money for it! I also thought I had unsalted butter but only had margarine. The icing turned out wonderful!! Perfect for icing with an icing bag - was not runny at all like other cream cheese icing recipes! Will do again for sure!!

We loved this! They were moist and light with a nice "spring" when you bite into one. I used a little over half the amount of confectioners sugar in the frosting and it came out plenty sweet. The frosting sent this cupcake over the top. Next time I will add some raisins and freeze some without frosting for a quick breakfast. Even with half the sugar, it still made twice as much frosting than needed, but thats o.k. because I'm going to go ahead and make another batch!

These are wonderful!  Moist, fluffy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 24 full-sized cupcakes and 24 minis.  I used a regular cream cheese frosting, and added in orange zest, which I used in the cake batter as well.  (I had oranges in the house and wasn't about to spend $5 on orange extract).  I also didn't measure out the individual spices, I was in a hurry and went with about a tbs. of pumpkin pie spice, my favorite!  Like others, I cut the sugar slightly and you'd never know.  And for those thinking the pineapple is a weird ingredient, don't worry, its great.  I used the stick blender and pureed a can of chunk pineapple.  It added great moisture and that little something you can't quite put your finger on when you taste them.  My husband doens't like pineapple at all and went nuts over these!!  ENJOY

This was my first attempt at baking something "from scratch."  They turned out GREAT!  The cake was moist and delicious, and the frosting was a PERFECT compliment.  I did end up with extra frosting... but somehow my husband didn't let it go to waste :)  After struggling to shred 1 cup worth of carrots, I used the food processor for the second cup.  Much easier and worked perfectly!  Next time I will puree the crushed pineapple as well.  Or at least remove the big chunks.  Getting the occasional pineapple bite was a little odd.  Still, overall this is a 5 star recipe!!

These cupcakes are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the cake part after reading the reviews that said there was a lot of icing. Make sure to use a very large bowl! I hardly had room in my normal sized mixing bowl, hehe! I will make these again for sure!

wonderful recipe...my family loved these for Easter dessert.  I used pecans instead of the walnuts and garnished icing with a whole pecan.  They were very moist and delicious!

These are the best carrot cupcakes I have ever had! I didn't use the frosting (I did just a normal cream cheese frosting) but the actual carrot cake is amazing. I just started baking and did the cake part of the recipe exactly as described (cooking time and all) and they came out perfect! I will be making this again and again. Thank you so much for the wonder recipe!

Yum! Though, admittedly, I just used Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting! :) I used whole wheat flour and a bit less sugar. I sprinkled the frosting with cinnamon and topped with a raisin!

This is probably one of the best carrot cakes I've ever made!!! Very moist and flavourful. The icing was amazing, but it made alot more than I needed.  I shredded some white chocolate and sprinkled it on top. Have been asked to make this again for a wedding cake!

These are very tasty, but they turned out weird and flat rather than a traditional rounded "cupcake" shape. The taste was great though, and very moist! I didn't have a problem that other reviews had with too much frosting, maybe because I used a wide piping tip and because I love a lot of frosting on my cupcakes! I'm not sure if I'll make these again, just because of the shape they came out. (PS I don't live in high altitude)

These were awesome!  I made them for a baby shower and can't even tell you how many people commented on them.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the white chocolate cream cheese frosting.  I instead used the cream cheese frosting from the recipe of 'carrot cake III' -- SO GOOD.  Will surely be making this again very soon.

I truly can say,It is the best. I am not a cup cake eater,this was delicious. It is moist light and healthier then other cup cakes. I sub the pineapple for 2 cup of apples and mixed the nuts with it. I will be serving this treat for a baby naming. I omit the orange extract from the recipe (I did not have it) and alternate the frosting with pink color frosting (add one drop of red food coloring) and white frosting. can't wait to eat more of it.

Really good cupcakes!  I found combination of the icing and the cupcake too sweet though.  Next time I'll just make the cupcakes on their own, since they're moist and sweet enough without the icing.

This recipe is FAB!!! Yes, the recipe for the frosting does makes about 4 times more than you need but who cares when it is just soooo good ;-D I needed to make the muffins at night but frost them in the morning. One reviewer said that, if you wanted to pipe the frosting, you'd need to thicken it. A great tip for this is make your frosting and fridge it over night, because it's chilled and slighly stiffer (but still smooth & creamy!) you have just enough control then to pipe it without having to change the recipe in any way to thicken it. The muffins are just slightly sticky which is great, such a treat. Yes, there are a few ingredients but just prepare everything first and it's really not as much of a chore as you'd think. Plus, they're worth the effort and, like I say, it's not too much of a chew :-D TRY THIS ONE OUT!!! TOP MARKS!!! Thanks 4 posting x

These were very tasty.  Used a standard Wilton cream cheese frosting.  The pineapple in the cupcakes is a nice touch.

What a delicious treat! I also halved the icing recipe. I used honey instead of vanilla and added a splash of orange juice instead of pineapple. They turned out just as moist and sweet. Worth a try!

The carrot cake is 3 stars, but the frosting is 5, so I split the difference by giving it 4 stars.  I would not make the cake again, but the white chocolate frosting is to die for!

Great recipe.  I made cupcakes just like the picture and had my husband take them to work where he got rave reviews.  I used the frosting recipe from Carrot Cake III because I didn't have any white chocolate on hand. It made more than 12 cupcakes.

Excellent flavor and so moist!! I followed the recipe. The only suggestion would be to make sure the crushed pineapple is really crushed. I had chunk on hand so I ended up cutting it up a bit, but it could have been cut up a bit more so that you don't get big pieces in the cupcakes. Excellent. Thanks for sharing.

These were wonderful and would've been out of this world if the cooking time hadn't been so off and I completely destroyed the first batch. I did 350 for twelve minutes and they were black and hard.

I made these for my son's 1st birthday and everyone loved them.  I didn't feel like doing a lot for the frosting so I used the recipe on this site for Cream Cheese Frosting II.  They were a big hit and I will definately be making them again.

This recipe was so good, I ate the batch that I was supposed to give away to my friends to eat. It is rich, moist, and has a nice flavor to it. Although I substituted pineapple with apple instead, it's still tastes good.

I just made this recipe and it is great!  The icing is sooooo yummy! I didn't use walnuts or orange, but other than that I followed the exact directions! The ising made enough that I could take some of the cupcakes out and frost them all the way like little cakes! Very good! Just wondering though, should these be stored in the fridge or at room temp?

Made the carrot cupcakes without the icing.  Very nice light flavor; I would increase the amount of nutmeg & ginger.  Perhaps with the icing it balances out. Overall, a very pleasant carrot cupcake.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! The icing is very sweet and yummy. I did not have orange extract so I put in a little extra vanilla extract instead. I was kind of skeptical of the orange anyway...I forgot to put the walnuts in the batter and didn't realize it until the cupcakes were in the oven so I sprinkled the walnuts on top of the icing instead. Also, I love cinnamon so I added a little extra. I brought them to work and everybody loved them!

I personally don't care for carrot cake, but these are to die for.  I used the white chocolate frosting which was yummie yummie!  The only thing that I did different was chopped the carrots with my cuisarnt food processor.  Next time I would also chop the pineapple chucks in it as well.  A+++++++

The cupcakes turned out really nice and moist.  I am still going to look for a recipe that doesn't include pineapple.  Even though I didn't tell my son what was in it, he found it!!  I used the bourbon icing for these, as I didn't have all the ingredients for it.  Overall though, again they were nice.

I've made this a couple times (without the nuts) and I always get rave reviews. I LOVE the icing, it compliments the cupcakes better than a regular cream cheese frosting would.  The folks in the office can't wait for me to make it again!  Thanks!

Everything you want in a carrot cake is accomplished in this recipe.  Truly a light, moist, tender & flavorful crumb.  Need we say more?  No.  White chocolate frosting is out of this world, just a slight tang from the cream cheese and not overly sweet (omitted the orange extract).  Like the other reviewers you don't need to make a whole batch of icing to frost the cupcakes, just half it.  Also got 18 standard cupcakes instead of the 12 noted on the recipe.  This is going to be an heirloom recipe.  Lovely!

Great recipe!  I accidentally baked them for 20 minutes which was far more than needed.  They ended up pretty dark.  But I did use a bit of coconut and the combination of spices was perfect.  Everyone enjoyed them lots.

When I first tasted the icing all I could taste was orange. So I made another batch without the orange extract and it tasted blan so I put the two togehter. I could still taste the orange but it tasted great on the cake. Next time I might add 1/2 the orange extract.

Recipe was ok. The muffins tasted like all spice muffins rather than carrot cake, and the frosting was a little too sweet. Agree with all of the other bakers, 1/2 the frosting recipe it makes a ton!

My lord. These cupcakes are ridiculously good. So moist and delicious.. I didn't change a single thing except for halved the icing (and still had plenty extra)and they turned out moist, pleasantly sweet and tasty as all-get-out. 

My friends will have to battle for them tomorrow! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Fantastic recipe, tasted delicious and I too will use them as a 'breakfast' muffin.  I did not make the frosting, I think they are sweet enough without.

I made these for my daughter's first birthday and they were a big hit. I omitted the nuts, but otherwise made it according to the recipe. It was relatively dense with a mild spice flavor. I would not describe it as overly moist, but moist enough. I actually plan to make the cupakes again without the icing for my children. They were a big hit as "breakfast muffins". The icing was good but VERY rich. You definitely don't need all of it! Next time I will add a little flax seed oil and make a batch to freeze for snacks/breakfast muffins.

The muffins are very moist and tasty, the frosting however is a little thin as it was wanting to run off of the muffins....even after they were totally cooled.  I tried to add more powdered sugar which did help, but I didn't get the consistancy that I wanted because I didn't want to add too much.  I doubled the muffin recipe, and left the frosting the same and still ended up with extra frosting, and I frosted 24 regular sized muffins, and 24 mini's.  I'll see if the frosting changes after being refrigerated, and then try spreading it again....it tastes good, just a bit thin, next time I will add more white chocolate.  Thanks bakerama.

Delicious!  Substituted applesauce for the oil and they're still very moist and delicious!  The icing was perfect.  Will use this one again!

I made these for Easter Brunch also. They are very moist, light, and have great texture.  The frosting is good too. I thought they were kind of spicy, but everyone else thought they tasted right.

Made these for Easter Brunch as carrot muffins.  Left off the icing.  They were delicious.  Very moist!  Would not change a thing in this recipe!
