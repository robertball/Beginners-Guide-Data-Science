This was mind-blowing delicious!! My friends raved the whole evening! Some suggestions, definitely add the 1 tsp. of espresso powder and vanilla as was suggested by another reviewer, also I used Ghirardelli chocolate 75% cocoa, it melts nicer making for a smoother richer consistency of the molten center.  Make sure not to overcook, when the top puffs up and there is no longer visible batter its time to take out. I greased the ramekins with butter and dusted with cocoa  powder and sugar, they slipped right out! The cocoa powder doesn't leave white like flour.  Amazing dessert, don't be gun shy they are a cinch to make and you will have a hit!

This was the most amazing dessert I've ever made (and I've made a lot!!).

I used Lindt chocolate (personal preference, just don't like Bakers choc.) I modified the order of the ingredients due to reading some other recipes:  Stir chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until melted. Cool slightly. Whisk eggs and egg yolks in large bowl to blend. Whisk in sugar, then chocolate mixture (a bit at a time) and flour. At the end, I added 1 tsp of espresso powder and 1 tsp of Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla, this made the chocolate flavor really stand out.  

You can also make these a day ahead and cover them with plastic wrap, which makes serving them at a dinner party a snap!

I baked these for 12 minutes right out of the refrigerator and I think any longer would have cooked the sauce in the center for too long, but that's a personal preference (I wanted a lot of fudge sauce in mine). Also, serving was made much easier by liberally buttering the ramekins ahead of time and sprinkling them with sugar and flour, when they came out of the oven, I ran a knife around the edges.  Then I placed a dessert plate on top of the ramekin and flipped the entire thing over.  The cake pops right out onto the plate, and it saves you the mess of trying to "dump" it out.  I served this with a creme anglaise (custard sauce) on the plate and guests were practically licking the plate!

This is an 'impossible-to-fail' recipe. We made it for my friend's birthday party, quite a bit away from our home. We were in a huge hurry... anyway we made it in the oven until it was still a little bit loose in the middle, then brought them to the party. After another 2min in the oven, it turned out as delicious as you can imagine(but it was not as 'molten' as the picture here), very moist yet a bit crispy on the edge, rich, well made chololate cake, personally the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Absolutely successful! We thought we were just very lucky. Then we tried another time at home, with some patience and love:). It turned out exactly as good as the picture, we didn't have any fresh berries at that time, instead we mixed frozen raspberries and blueberries with a little bit of vanilla icecream in the mixer, served it beside, delicious! We saved the rest of them in the fridge covered with plastic, warm it up when we want, its tastes and texture don't really change so much. This is a very delicate but rough, easy to make recipe, 100% recommendation. PS I signed up to this website just because i wanted to write something about this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

MMMMMMMMMM! I was craving chocolate and just made these cakes, and they are awesome! I followed the instructions exactly except that I used a 6-cup muffin pan instead of souffles. The recipe made exactly 6 cupcake sized cakes. I also only baked them for 10 mins and they came out perfectly with a gooey center. Will DEFINITELY make again!

These are the bomb!  And super simple.  I tried another Molten Chocolate Cake recipe from this site but didn't like them as well as these.  The soft center of these seemed more like a pudding rather than a runny undercooked cake.

These cakes are wonderful! Since I didn't have any little souffle dishes I just used cupcake trays and they turned out fine. I used semi sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, but they were still delicious.  I also love how easy this recipe is.

The easiest recipe to make. And the best cakes ever! I took this to a friend's surprise party and baked them in the oven for 10 minutes before his arrival. It was a HUGE hit! Not only was my fiance impressed (I never bake), but event the hostess who is a dessert baker extraordinaire. In fact, she asked me for the recipe. If that doesn't say enough about the result, I don't know what is.

OMG this was incredible!!! My sister made these and it was so good I stole the recipe and went right out to buy the correct dishes to cook them in. I made it a few days later for hubby and served it w/ vanilla icecream and hubby and the kids LOVED it. One son didn't like the molten part so I just cooked his a few mins more and it was perfect for him. I followed the recipe but like others suggested I used the Ghirardelli 60%Bittersweet Chocolate chips and it was heavenly! THANKS!!!

Perfect!  It actually came out looking EXACTLY like the picture!  How often does THAT happen?!  Very quick, easy and elegant.  Would look beautiful with a garnish of berries.

this was a really moist recipe. I made them for thanksgiving and everyone raved about them :) 
make sure you use three eggs PLUS three egg yokes. I forgot the egg yokes the first time and it didnt have the chocolate lava on the inside.

it is now a family favorite!

Really amazing!  You really have to go against your gut instinct though and pull these out way before you think you should.  Dusted with powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an elegant and delicious dessert!  I buttered my ramekins and dusted them with a combination of cocoa powder and powdered sugar.  I also used dark chocolate chips in place of the baking chocolate.  Not as intense of a chocolate flavor, but still wonderful.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for cooking them for only 11 minutes. The centers were slightly more cooked than expected but next time I'll just take them out after 10 minutes. The taste was fantastic though! I served this with a scoop of vanilla icecream- magnific!

This was a really, really good recipe! I followed it exactly as written on my first try and it came out great.  The second time, I used Ghirardelli and it was slightly better than the Baker's brand.  I am giving it 4 stars because it was almost as good as the one I tasted in a restaurant. I think there might be one secret ingredient we are missing. If I discover what it is I'll let you all know! Also, a tip when trying to make everything ahead of time-- I decided to try this recipe a third time and prepared it the night before. I placed the batter in custard cups, wrapped them with plastic wrap and placed them in the refrigerator. I did not taste a difference at all when I made them although I think they may have taken about a minute more to bake-- which doesn't matter because timing is hard for these and you need to watch them closely anyway.

A variation on this recipe is to add 2 oz. semisweet chocolate and 2 T. some flavor liqueur (orange, hazelnut, raspberry, etc.). I served these with vanilla ice cream. Next time I may serve with creme anglaise (or just melt some high quality ice cream). I'm not sure how you could get 12 servings from these ingredients. I made 6 (7 oz.) custard cups. I also may experiment by putting a Lindt chocolate truffle in the center of each before baking. As many others have commented, this is an easy, crowd pleasing dessert.

I needed a quick but decadent dessert for my husband's birthday -- I'm pregnant and fighting morning sickness, so baking the promised double layer chocolate cake with homemade frosting just wasn't going to happen this year.  This dessert was fast, ridiculously easy, and came out perfect.  

I did incorporate the following suggestions from other posters:  1) dust the custard dishes with cocoa powder after greasing them - the cakes will slide right out, and 2) melt the chocolate on the stovetop instead of in the microwave.  It takes a little longer on the stovetop, but avoids the risk of burning the chocolate in the microwave.  

My 11 year old has already demanded that I make this for his birthday, too -- and that's several months away :-)  Yummy stuff.

I made this last night, soooo easy and tasty. great if you need a quick dessert to impress. I used a very large muffin tin and I baked it for 10 mins and they came out great. I had a bit of extra batter and baked it in a regular muffin tin for 10 mins and they came out like browines. The recipe suggests 14-15 mins. I would keep a close eye.

This recipe is easy and if served followed exactly and served immediately, tastes like the "molten chocolate cake" or "flourless chocolate cake" served in  two of the five star restuarants in Philadelphia.

my first molten choco cake, and it was DIVINE!  such moist awesome choco goodness.  12-13 min is about right!  Serve it with some vanilla ice cream and strawberries, it's perfection!  For reference: 10 tsbp of butter is just over 1/2 cup; 8 oz of chocolate is 3/4 cup (I used semi-sweet ghardelli choco chips)

YUM!!  These are every bit as good as the high dollar restaurant dessert we had the other night..They came out perfect with minimal work.  I did use ground instant coffee in place of the espresso and I added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  These are to die for!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it still tasted fantastic even though it failed me in presentation. I doubled the recipe to fill 12 6oz. ramekins, I made them the night before I served them, buttered and cocoa-powdered the ramekins and they sat overnight in the refrigerator. When I was ready to bake them I put them in the oven, but they never set up. My guests had to eat them out of the ramekins :( Maybe next time I should allow them to come to room temperature before throwing them in the oven.

So good!  We put a little dollop of vanilla ice cream with them.  The cold ice cream with the hot cake was so good!

This recipe is absolutely yummy!  Exactly what we were looking for.  I only gave it 4 stars, though, because the two times I made it by following the directions exactly they weren't molten in the center.  I think it takes some practice figuring out how hot your oven runs and the size of the ramekins you use.  Overall, a great recipe!  Easy and delicious.

All I have to say is OMG!!! These were soooo good!  And they couldn't be easier.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I served this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Next time I will try it with magic shell and some pecans on top as well.

So easy!  My boyfriend loved it and I'm definitely making it again.  Highly recommend dusting greased ramekins with cocoa powder, as in previous reviews.  I used Bernard Callebaut bittersweet chocolate chips and some fancy butter from Buon Italia in Chelsea Market (NY).  Amazinnnnnng.

amazing.
I used one of the pans for 6 minicakes  intended for things like this (the bottoms lift out) and they turned out perfect.  Great with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries.

I personally am not a big chocolate fan, but I made these for my Mom for Mother's Day, since she is.  These turned out PERFECT!  She loved them, and they definitely taste just as good as the ones in the fancy restaurants.  Just be sure not to overbake them, or you won't have any "lava" (I overbaked a few of mine).  Flavor is superb and the look is elegant :)

These were fabulous, used 1/2 Dove milk chocolate, and 1/2 semi-sweet.  I baked for 12 minutes and it was a smidge too long.  Next time I will take them out when there is still a small circle of uncooked batter in the middle of the ramekin to ensure gooeyness. Served with a raspberry sauce, very impressive!

I have to admit I had some doubt about this receipe (more like my ability to make them)- but they came out perfect!  We had company over for dinner and they just raved.  It was like a 5 star restaurant.  As others have said- make sure you pull them out early and don't overcook.  I served them with a mint leave and raspberries dusted with powdered sugar.  It was a beautiful presentation and a simply scrumptious dessert.  I will make this over and over again through the years.  It's an easy way to make people think you are a gourmet cook!

I served this at a sit down Dinner Party for 10 people, every ramekin came back completely empty and that was AFTER 7 other courses of food!!  I could not find Bakers Bittersweet so I used another brand, something like Ghiradled? Loved it!

I have made this twice and both times it turned out great and had rave reviews. I even bought some special dishes to bake it in it was so good. Very easy as long as you watch it closely in the oven. The first time I made it in a muffin pan and the cooking time was only about 11 mins. I did add some vanilla the second time but it was great with or without it.

This recipe was not only very easy but very tasty as well!  I did follow some of the reviews made by others: I prepared the ramikins by first spraying then dusting with cocoa powder I also used ghirdelli chocolate (because I love it) and after slightly cooling the chocolate mixture added to the eggs then to the powdered sugar/flour mixture.  Be careful to watch them carefully, Take out when they start to puff up in center, if overcooked they will still be Excellent but even better if the molten center is left to ooze out.  mmmm...

I made these last night for fake Valentine's dinner (the 14th was no good) with Baker's semi-sweet chocolate and they were amazing. I don't know about the vanilla suggestion, but a bit of espresso powder would probably put these over the top. It's still a 5 star recipe exactly as written though.

I made these for my husband on Valentines Day! Since it was just the two of us, I baked 2 and stored the rest in the frig. The first ones came out a little 'cakey' so I reduced the baking time the next night and they came out PERFECT! Yummy! Vanilla ice cream was served with them ~ it was like eating a brownie sundae with hot fudge sauce on it:) SOOO simple too ...  and I love that they may be made ahead of time and refrigerated ... what a great help to the hostess for a party. Make sure you allow them to come to room temp prior to baking! Definitely a keeper!

This was very easy and extremely decadent.  I added a tsp of cinn. to the batter after everything was combined (we love cinn. with chocolate) and it was unbelievable.  I used a mini-cakes pan (it had 6 mini-cakes, very similar to a large muffin pan).  I made the batter in advance, and let it come to room temp before baking only 12-13 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Any more would have been overcooked.  After baking, took the knife around the edges and then carefully flipped the cakes.  I was afraid some would break since I baked them all in 1 pan, but they didn't.  The inside was cooked perfectly and the chocolate oozed out.  Presentation and taste were wonderful.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  This is a perfect dessert to impress the boss, in-laws or anyone really.  The best part is you can prep in advance and just pull it out a little before dinner to come to room temp so it can cook while you clear the dishes.

The first time I made this it didn't turn out very well.  I overbaked it at 14 minutes, probably because I preheated the pan underneath the cups.  

The second time the recipe turned out perfectly with the texture similar to photo #1.  I baked it for 14 minutes on the middle rack of the oven and did not preheat the pan under the cups.  You really have to watch them.  I have posted a photo of what they were like when I took them out.

These are very easy to make and look like you spent all day baking.  My friends and family love them.  I have to rely on their opinion since I hate chocolate, but love cooking with it for others.  This recipe has become a family favorite.

I subbed 6 tablespoons of sugar + 6 oz unsweetened chocolate for the bittersweet.  My cakes came out molten in the center.  Make sure to butter & sugar the ramekins beforehand - easier for the cakes to slip out onto the plate.  The only problem for me was that the part that cooked all the way was more brownie and fudgy-like than cake-like.  Maybe I'll look for another recipe for that texture.

The first time I did this it did not turn out.  I was very dissappointed.  The cake stuck to the ramekins and I think I overfilled the ramekins so it ended up all over.  I gave this one more shot and with a little luck, they came out pretty darn good.  If you aren't a big fan of dark chocolate, go for the semisweet...It works just as well!  I still have a little perfecting to do but it was better the second time around

Probably too much butter compared to other recipes. These seemed a little dry even though I baked the recommended amount of time. Everyone liked them, but they didn't have the gooey middle I was looking for. I'll try some of the other molten cakes on this site and their recommendations.

Sooooo good!  Everyone was impressed and its so easy to make.  You may have to play around with baking times.  I made it perfect in my gas oven but made it in my mom's electric oven for the same time and they were undercooked but still good.

OMG!!  This was excellent...I would have given 10 stars if I could have.  It was perfect, just like the picture...and I even forgot to add the additional 3 egg yolks!  I did add 1/2 t. vanilla & 1/2 t. expresso powder and used 3 oz Ghiradelli bittersweet & 3 oz Ghiradelli semi-sweet. Spinkled with powdered sugar and served with fresh strawberries.  You've got to try it!

Just like the chocolate lava cake served in  restaurants! This was incredibly simple for a dessert that seems like it should take a lot of work. I loved it!

This really came out delicious. I used Ghirardelli 60% dark chocolate mixed with a few ounces of Ghirardelli Espresso Intense Dark chocolate, and oh wow was it fantastic. Raspberries and strawberries go really well with this chocolatey goodness.
