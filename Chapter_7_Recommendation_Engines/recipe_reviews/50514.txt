Great recipe!  I loved the marinade.  I added some minced fresh garlic, olive oil, and worcestershire sauce.  I just eyeballed everything and put everything into a ziploc bag.  I didn't prepare the steaks in a skillet, I put them on the grill.  The smokiness from the fresh rosemary is a nice accompaniment to the steaks.  These go great with baked potatoes on the grill and a fresh garden salad.

I was skeptical about this recipe and took some of the others advice.  After removing the steaks I added garlic and minced onion to the pan, sauteed for a few minutes then added the wine mixture.  I reduced the wine mixture to about 1/3 cup then removed from the heat and added 2 teaspoons butter.  My company all enjoyed it and really liked the flavors.

Nice, I removed the steaks before doing the reduction and added a little garlic and butter which thickens the sauce and adds a bit  of flavour.  The end result is going to depend on the quality of the wine, another substitution would be to use balsamic vinegar to deglaze instead of the wine.

Very delicious.  Simple to prepare and tastes great.  I used dried herbs...didn't have the fresh ones on hand.  Thank you for the post.

This recipe is simple & delicious.  The only change I made was to add garlic since I'm Italian & I add garlic to everything.  This would be a perfect recipe to make for guests because I think it would suit everyone's tastebuds as its not too overpowering.  I'll definitely be making this again!

We really liked this recipe.  I put the steaks in the wine to marinate for about 30 minutes- after the rosemary had soaked in it for 2 hours. Left steaks in boiling wine mixture for 1 minute, then removed them- left rosemary in until I followed one other suggestion of thickening sauce with a little flour.  Very good.

I LOVE this sauce.  I was skeptical about the red wine and rosemary combination, but the flavors blend beautifully.  I did add a little butter and allowed the sauce to reduce a bit while the steaks rested.  The steaks were a bit dry, and I found the 16 minutes of cooking time to be far too much.  Next time I'll change my cooking method a bit, but the red wine-rosemary sauce is a keeper.

Great result for the ease of it!  Just used dried rosemary, and added a drop of Worcestershire and garlic.   The kids, who are accustomed to pretty plain and traditional steak, tore this up.

Very good. Though since I didn't have any fresh rosemary, I tried it with fresh basil.

This sauce was really good and went great with baled lamb chops. I used the balsamic vinegar, garlic, and butter like the previous post user suggested and it was awesome.I also added a touch of sugar to make my sauce a little sweeter. I like my sauces a little thicker personally so I added a touch of flour at the end to thicken- it was delicious and interesting. Very different and I used this with baked lamb chops. We all loved it!! Thanks for the tips.

Followed the recipe exactly, but used one steak in the slow cooker. It was a bit overdone; tender but the flavor didn't appeal to us (reminded me of pot roast).

to save on calories/meat portions, had the butcher slice the strip in half, so portions were cut about 1/2 inch thick.  I used a cast iron griddle, lightly greased with olive oil, high heat (gas top), 3 minutes on each side: perfect, juicy, loved the sauce (added garlic and a little splash of oil, which probably wasn't necessary: just habit)

I'm not sure what we did wrong, maybe someone here can help me.  The only thing we changed was the rosemary, we used crushed, dried rosemary.  The steaks tasted good, but they burned on the outside and it smoked up our entire apartment.  The flavor was good and the middle of the steak was perfect, but the outer edges were completely burnt.  We made this recipe twice and both times set off the smoke detectors.  I'm thinking maybe the heat was up too high?

Inadvertently, I marinated my ribeyes in the wine mixture. The only thing I can say is that I didn't get much flavor out of this and dinner was a complete disappointment. Will not be trying again. We added seasoning salt and fresh cracked pepper to try and make it better but we barely touched the steaks.

Great recipe. In the summer months I prefer not to use the oven. Cooking it on the stovetop was quick and easy. This recipe was great and my family loved it. I especially liked the fresh rosemary and added a bit of olive oil to the marinade. The butter was a nice addition to this. I then put it in foil with its own juice and it remains tasty and not dry at all. Will do this again. Vivian

This steak was amazing. I was a little skeptical because some of the reviews said “my guests loved it but I didn’t.” I tried it anyway and it was delicious. Only did a couple minor changes after reading some reviews: I removed the steak and added garlic, the wine mixture, and a little bit of butter and brought it to a boil. I then added my steak back into the pan and let it boil for a couple minutes and once I turned it off I let the steak rest in the pan with the mixture. It was delicious, will definitely make this again!

I had to make a few changes to the recipe.  First, I rubbed the steak down with garlic and pepper.  Also, since I did not have a deep platter for the steak to sit in, I took the leftover cooked wine and used it as a au jus.

Only thing I would note is that on my stovetop it took 6 minutes per side to cook to medium well but was otherwise delicious. Didn't have to add anything, was a great meal.

Easy, delicious, and complements the expensive piece of meat rather than overwhelming it. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a great sauce for a steak! Thanks for the suggestion. The rosemary added such a great earthy taste.

Excellent!  I've never been very good with steaks, but this was simple and came out wonderfully.
