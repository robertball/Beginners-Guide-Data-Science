Family loved this ! It was the first time I used jicama.  I added an apple to this and reduced the salt by 2/3.

Try this recipe! This was very good on fish tacos, in spite of some serious ingredient problems... I didn't have a green bell pepper so used a jalape√±o. My corn did not "blacken", but did cook - I think it was the wrong pan and not enough heat. Next time I may just grill the corn and then cut it from the cob. The biggest issue was when I went to the garden for cilantro I found it had all bolted to flower. It didn't taste anything like cilantro. So I picked some spicy oregano and some parsley. I added freeze dried (horrors!) cilantro. It turned out amazing! I will make this again and with real, fresh cilantro - I am sure it will be even better. It makes a lot. But I won't mind eating it for lunches this week. This is a very nice salsa!
