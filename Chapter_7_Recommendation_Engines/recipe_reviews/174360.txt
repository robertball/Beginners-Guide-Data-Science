This was to die for!! I had more time than I thought I would have so I marinated the tenderloin bites in a mixture of garlic, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, white vinegar, salt, pepper, and lemon. The tenderloins just melted in my mouth and my boyfriend and sister (who rarely eats meat) loved it and asked me to make it again the next night.

FANTASTIC! Prepared exactly as the recipe outlined and it was delicious. We usually section off the loin, tenderize the meat and then bread and fry - this has a very similar flavor without all the hassle of frying - keeper, keeper, keeper! One thing to add, my oven has a LO and a HI broil setting, I prepared these on the LO setting and they came out perfect - 3 minutes per side.

A wonderful combination of flavors for a cut of meat that can't be messed up. I didn't serve over arugula, but served them as a kind of venison nuggets. Not crunchy, or soggy, just very tender. Very nice!

I actually really enjoyed this recipe and so did all of my roommates. (Which is rare!) It was very easy to make and had a nice presentation. The only changes I made the second time around was to try it out with some stir fry instead of arugula and it turned out very well. (Also, the boys liked it better because it felt more "filling" than just the greens suggested in the original recipe.) In any case, very tasty and very easy. Thanks for sharing! :)

This is my FAVORITE way to prepare tenderloins!  Instead of lining my pan with foil, I used a well seasoned baking stone to add even more crispiness.  We also like it in the winter on rice or sauteed spinach.

This was pretty good.  The meat was very tender.  I broiled 5 minutes on the 1st side, then 3 on the 2nd - which put all pieces 160 - 165 degrees.  My family loved this as is -- I found the "crust" soggy and rather distracting from the good, tender texture of the meat.

Update -- 03/27/2012 -- Since my husband is on the South Beach Diet (and 30 pounds down in 9 wks!), I decided to try this recipe replacing the bread crumbs with crushed plain pork rinds.  Absolutely delicious!! In fact, we liked this version way better than the one with the bread crumbs.  I did add Italian Seasoning to the rinds.  Wouldn't want to eat this way every night because of the extra fat, but it is low carb and keeps his weight off!

Excellent!  I made a few changes.  Used regular bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  Sides were  green salad and rice. I will definitely make this again.  The vesion melts in your mouth.

Awesome recipe.  My husband shot his deer over the weekend and I cooked up this recipe three days later. Only change.....I did not use fresh parsley, just parsley out of the spice rack.  I baked rather then broiled...for about 15 minutes at 415 degrees.  
Extremely tender and amazing flavor.  
I just served with rice rather then arugula.

Very good! I had time so I marinated the meat for 24 hours. I added smoked paprika, garlic powder, and oregano to my bread crumbs. Flipped my meat halfway through and they came out great! Not tough at all! I agree with another poster that you can cut the breading in 1/2 since I had to throw most of it away...

Made exactly like the recipe said and it was incredible!!!! We like it a little more rare, it was more tender.  My kids who dip everything in ranch or ketchup didn't use a thing, that is a true compliment!  Will make again and again.

I don't usually like deer, but my husband wanted me to cook some tenderloins and backstraps. I tried this recipe tonight (substituted ritz crackers and italian seasoning instead of bread crumbs which I did not have) and oh my gosh... tasted just like steak! I actually surprised my husband by having seconds! Very good! Easy to make too!

My husband loves venison and I don't-we both thought this recipe was great!!! We used horseradish sauce to dip them in.  We both thought it tasted less like venison and more like pork chops.

This was a hit!  I marinated the tenderloin in vinegar, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, chili garlic sauce and lemon zest for about 12 hours.  Then I followed the recipe as follows except I just served them as "bites" and skipped on the arugula.  They turned out so tender and flavorful.  There were a hit and gone in minutes.

excellent...2nd time i've made venison...came out a little like medium-well steak.  i soaked the tenderloins first in some milk w/ lemon for about 15 min (supposed to take out the "gaminess").  didn't have breadcrumbs, so i crumbled up half a tube of ritz crackers & sprinkled w/ italian seasoning.  instead of arugula, i served the breaded venison over cooked spinach & garnished w/ sauteed onions & peppers.  very light but filling meal! hubby loved it.

This was my first time cooking venison and I didn't know what to expect so I avoided buying special ingredients (didn't want to waste the $ if it wasn't going to taste good). Instead, I used panko breadcrumbs and added Italian seasoning; also subbed dried chervil for parsley, and didn't serve it with any greens.  The recipe didn't say where to add the salt and pepper, so I did as I usually do and seasoned the meat prior to breading it.  The venison was good, despite my overcooking it.  It didn't blow me away, though.

Overall this was a wonderful recipe although I made tons of changes. Out of all of the venison recipes my boyfriend and I have tried lately this is his favorite. Not mine, but I would still rank it as a 5-star. CHANGES I MADE: although I didn't measure anything I used olive oil and a bit of italian dressing. had no garlic on hand (gasp!) so used garlic salt. local grocery store didn't have fresh parsley (gasp again!) so I had to use dried. used fat-free mozz instead of parm. may mix the two nextime. skipped the lemon altogether. used italian dressing over arugala and ate it on the side with the meat and as a salad. used sliced venison chunks and then i had a ton of ground venison sausage. i used left over breading, mixed into venison sausage, added minced onions, and made bite-size meatballs. broiled the same as the tenderloins.  We actually like the meatballs better, but the basic jist of the recipe was great! I really liked the earthy flavor of the arugala with the venison but i will probably use a mixture of arugala and spinach next time, or maybe a full-blown mixed salad. The breading was so wonderfully flavored there was no dip needed -- usually I need A1 sauce with breaded steaks.   Great recipe! Thanks!

Awesome! My husband asks for this on a regular basis. I'm not a huge fan of venison and I loved this recipe. Make sure you keep a close eye on the bites as they broil and turn them often. The breading can burn quickly if you're not paying attention.

My favorite venison recipe by far. You have to definitely keep the venison cubes under 1 inch or it will effect your broil time significantly.

I am not a big fan of venison and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick, easy, healthy and flavorful.  You could cut down on the bread crumbs as others have suggested.  We served on Romaine lettuce and sliced fresh tomatoes, sprinkled with Greek salad dressing (I didn't have lemon).  Thank you for sharing.

We are big fans of venison and eat a lot of it, so I am always looking for new ways to prepare it.  This was good.  My opionion is that it kind of gave the venison a "parmesean chicken fried steak" sort of taste to it.  Cut the breading recipe maybe in half (I had so much breading left over that I had to discard).  Im sure I will make again sometime.

These were so yummy.  My picky kids asked for 2nds and 3rds.  There was nothing left on the plate!  Fork tender...melted in or mouth.  Beware if you have any extra breading on the pan or meat, it will burn.

Loved it!  Served it on a platter as a finger food during the Superbowl with 4 or five different sauces.  It went fast!

My fiancé always wants venison and his kids and I are pretty sick of it!  I needed some new ways to cook it and came across this recipe!!  The kids, my fiancé and I loved it!!  They taste great without any dipping sauce but we did try A1 and ketchup and they were both great if you are a dipper!!  Definitely will be making this again!!

My husband likes a lot of breadcrumbs, so I actually just laid out the venison on a cookie sheet, and then liberally sprinkled the bread crumb mixture over top.  (I used about 1 1/2 times the breadcrumbs and cheese, but about the same amount of oil).  It was delicious!

The recipe made twice as much breading as was necessary, but the finished product was good. Even my 3-year-old ate quite a few of the bites!

I only had plain Panko bread crumbs so I added Italian seasoning blend.  When the backstrap thawed I discovered it was already in medallions so I used them as is.  Broiled on low 3-3.5 minute per side.  Rice and salad as sides.  There were no leftovers!  And much easier than frying.

Very good. I use venison cube steak and celery leaves instead of parsley other than followed the recipe. Mine was a little dry but I think I cooked it a little to long. It was very good anyway.

This is a solid recipe for handling back straps. Good instructions. I still ran my meat through a tenderizer first though and soaked it in milk first - a trick to get rid of too much game flavor.

Used this recipe my first time cooking venison. I did 2 pounds for 3 people & did not have any left overs. I put crumb mixture in a gallon storage bag with the meat & shook it. I did it in the bowl for the first pan but my patience ran out so I threw it all in a bag to save time. I feel it mixed the ingredients better & the second batch seemed more flavorful. I didn't have parsley or arugula & it didn't matter. Excellent. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe!!! I actually soaked my meat in water for a couple of days and then Dale's for about 30 or 45 minutes before I cooked them. They were great and such an easy and simple recipe. Quick clean up too!! Definitely making these again!

I made these almost exactly to recipe (just added a little extra spices like I usually do) and they were delicious!  I was doubtful but they were tender and yummy.  I served over pasta which was a little heavy but my boyfriend felt they would be good with a light tomato sauce... almost like a venison parm.  But they were easy and so good.  This will definitely happen again!

Amazing!  So good, wouldn't change a thing. Tender on the inside, crispy/crunchy on the outside.
