This is a delicious and filling sandwich with many layers of flavor.  The sauce had just the right amount of spiciness for us, and the veggies give it a nice crunch.  I cooked fresh shrimp rather than using frozen, and picked up a nice 5-grain roll from the bakery. I can see serving this with a nice Asian noodle salad. Enjoyed everything about this sandwich and wouldn’t change a thing.  I consider this a gourmet sandwich and would serve to company.

I enjoyed this different type of sandwich. I used shrimp, but mine were raw so I sauteed them in a little butter first, and then assembled it all on a seeded roll. The sauce had a nice tang and spicyness to it. Although I liked it, I found it a little messy to eat with contents falling out of the roll. Still good, though. Thanks J9.
