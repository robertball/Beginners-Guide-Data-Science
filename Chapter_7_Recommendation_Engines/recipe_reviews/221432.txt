Made as is. The taste is very good but I'm going to be honest and say that the texture was so dense and so dry. Some folks might like it that way but i want it moist as stated. I'm a little bummed out because no one ate this at all. I wonder if the flour/cornmeal measurements is a typo or something. I'm going to play around with this recipe and give an update.

Omg this was so good! I read the reviews and decided to add 1 cup of vitamin D milk JIC it is dry. I probably didnt need to do that but still no regrets. I also used real butter at room temp so maybe that helped? I added fresh jalapenos on one side of the pan, I have kids, and im so pleased with how moist it turned out, sweet and authentic flavors. Its not so sweet like cake but pretty close to it! The jalepenos really do compliment it!

This is a delicious cornbread.  I added the optional sugar and it was very sweet and tasty, my kids loved it.  Due to another reviewer saying that it had been dry, I added a cup of milk to my batch, and it turned out super moist.  It took 45 minutes to bake to perfection.

This is wonderful. We have to make it dairy-free due to food allergies, so we used 2 small cans of Cream of Coconut in place of the sweetened condensed milk, and Earth Balance in place of the butter, though we have used coconut oil with great results. We do not add the extra sugar, because we feel like it's sweet enough with the coconut cream. We also modify with one can of corn and 2 cans of cream-style corn. Very moist and rich, perfect for serving with soup. Sweet, with a good depth to it. I even ate it for breakfast a few mornings!

I made this cornbread following others reviews I used 1 can corn and 2 cans cream style corn, but did make muffins and cooked them for 15-18 minutes, I made some with diced green chilies and some without I used some cupcake liners and some without , but all three batches came out good, it made 36 muffins with me filling the muffin tins with 1/3 cup of batter and it goes great with the slow cooker chicken taco soup on this site...will make these again =D

I recently made this and it was a HUGE success--I did NOT add the sugar and accidently left the melted butter in the microwave but it was still moist and delicious!

I tried the recipe...it was delicious and decadent. However, I recommend a 9x13x2 inch baking dish. A 2 quart baking dish is much too small. The 9x13x2 is perfect.

I didn't have 2 cans of regular corn so I winged it and added 4oz or so of heavy cream. (Yes, I know.) Also skipped the sugar because my condensed milk was sweetened. Baked it in a pre-heated iron skillet. Best cornbread ever.

Made this and it was perfect!  Only thing I changed was that I used prepared cornbread mix.  One, because I'm lazy and two, because I didn't have cornmeal in the pantry.   I don't think this recipe needs any adjustments at all.  It does just fine the way it is!

I often 'tweak' recipes for my own taste, but this one looked good right out of the box and it is! It's a really nice moist corn bread that goes perfect with soup.

I didn't have the corn on hand. I did follow the recipe otherwise, and they were great! They did not get too hard the next day, and had an amazing flavor. Not as sweet as I thought it would be with the condensed milk, which is a bonus for me. Will be using this recipe again; Thank you!

The cornbread turned out quite well. It was very moist and flavorful. It was just a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely make it again but reduce the amount of sugar used.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use some sugar, but only 1/4 cup. Also didn't want the bread too moist but not dry so I used half cup of Milk. Finally added mild jalapeno peppers for a bite. I used mild cause of my kiddos. If this was just for myself and husband I would of added hot peppers. Baked it in my cast iron skillet for 45 minutes and it was perfect! Yum!

This was so tasty!  It was very moist and dense, almost like a bread pudding.  I made it without the sugar, and no one missed it.  It was sweet, tasted of corn, and left none of the corn meal grit that some recipes do.  

Mine was not uniform like the picture here, it separated into three layers, and the corn formed the second layer.  

I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is AMAZING. Very moist and so delicious! I added 3 diced jalapenos to the recipe to give it a little spice and it was really great! 

Note: There's no way the recipe fits in a 2-qt baking dish; you have to use a 3-qt dish.

I was ok with this.  I made two batches, one as written.  It was alright.  It's cornbread.  The second batch I added a little more sweetened condensed milk, diced jalapenos, shredded habanero cheese and a slice of unseeded Jalapeno on top.  It is much better that way.

It's delicious! This is just your average American style corn bread. It has texture, it's moist and delish.  Thumbs up for this recipe. Instead of 2 cans of whole kernel, I used 2 cans of creamy style corn and 1 can of the whole Kernel.

I so wanted to love this.. but it is so dense and dry! It also had no flavor. No sweetness (even with the sugar), no buttery flavor, nothing. No salty goodness but that's because I used no salt added corn.  Just plain ole' cornmeal taste.  I like the real corn pieces throughout and it was easy to make.  I'd not use no salt added corn next time and use the 1C milk as some suggested

wow, this recipe is decadent! I used two cans of cream corn like others suggested. it turned out rich and fluffy and moist and absolutely delicious. but this is definitely a treat rather than an everyday recipe.

notes: use a 3 quart baking dish (I used 9x13) rather than the 2 quart dish the recipe called for. it makes sooooo much. I cut mine into 32 pieces! also, watch the baking time. mine only needed 40 minutes.

if I make this again I will definitely try to lighten it up a bit. I'll stick to one can creamed corn and add the milk like others suggested. it doesn't need the optional sugar and 1/4 cup butter would be plenty. might omit an egg or two as well. finally, I'll add the diced green chilis I was planning on adding this time around but forgot. bah!

I have been craving corn bread with whole corn in it for a while now, so I decided to give this a go.  It did not disappoint!  I took the suggestion of some other users and went with 2 cans cream corn and 1 can regular, and it turned out super moist and rich.  It is a bit eggy, but I really like the almost custardy note of the eggs (I can see how that might be offputting to some, though).  This is totally going to be my new go to corn bread recipe!
