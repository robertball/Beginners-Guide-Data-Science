This is one of my favorite recipes in the world!  It's super easy and so delicious.  I always use turkey sausage, rather than pork.  It's good no matter what you use though.

This dish went first at the brunch where I served it. Yum! I baked ahead of time and reheated in the AM.

Wonderful Recipe.  I used canned Pillsbury garlic breadsticks, as I didn't have crescent rolls. The garlic taste was an extra added bonus. Before adding the sausage, I baked the crust alone for about 4 minutes. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne to the egg mixture.  YUMMY !

I just used a roll of Pillsbury pizza dough, added some sauteed mushroom and onions, and it was a pretty tasty breakfast for the family.  I like making "one dish" egg recipes, rather then trying to do 5 individual egg requests.

I added an extra egg and used both mozz & cheddar.  I doubled the recipe, making two pans & thought it was just as good as leftovers as it was originally.  This will be a regular with my family.

It was a great and quick alternative to the traditional egg casserole that I always make.  Like almost everyone on this site- I did change a few ingredients:)  Used a ham steak cut into chunks, about 5 green onions chopped and sauteed with the ham for about 3-4 min.  I baked the crescent roll crust for about 5 min then layered the ham and green onion, sharp cheddar, then added the egg to the top.  Covered with foil after the first 10 minutes, mine also took longer to cook, about 25-30 min.  Oh, also used about 1/2 cup milk and 6 eggs, and spiced it up with salt and pepper and a few shakes of Tonys.  Will definitely make again!

This was so easy, my 9 year old did most of the work. It was also quite good. Add some sauted green peppers or onions and crumbled cooked bacon on before the cheese and this is easily a 5 star recipe.

Excellent recipe! Such a nice change from the old standby breakfast casserole! Everyone gobbled it up, asked for seconds and the recipe too!

I used a roll of turkey breakfast sausage and added a liberal dose of crushed red pepper to the sausage while it was cooking to make it "hot".  My husband commented while scarfing this down:  "You really need to make this more often."  Quick, easy, and delicious!  This will be a staple in my weekend breakfast rotation from now on!

This was very easy to assemble and pretty good.  I served it for a quick dinner with fried potatoes & fruit.  Next time, I will add some sauteed onions & peppers for more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy.  I used Pillsbury Pizza dough instead.  Worked perfectly.  Cooked dough 8 minutes prior to adding toppings.  Used cooked crumbled bacon and green onions.  It was yummy!

Delicious and so easy to throw together! I used Jimmy Dean's hot sausage and added a couple of splashes Tabasco sauce to egg mixture to spice things up. It was so good!!! I probably used a little more cheese than the recipe called for as well. What's a pizza without cheese, right?

I only used 1/2 lb. sausage because that is all I had.  I'll probably keep only using 1/2 lb., it was plenty.  I cooked the sausage with about 1/3 C onion.  Also, I used reduced fat crescent rolls since the regular has transfat.

This was just ok.  I'm not a big crescent roll fan.  It is easy & fast to make.  Not as thick as some breakfast casseroles.  I used ham instead of sausage.
