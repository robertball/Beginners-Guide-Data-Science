I modified this quite a bit.  I used a pasta called Fusillini which has zucchini and spinach in it.  I had to use more olive oil and also added butter together because if not, it would have been much more dry.  I chopped the onion finely and also added more grated cheese and parsley for garnish.  While I drained the pasta I added the scrambled egg in the pot that I used for the pasta with the flame off and it cooked very nice and light.  Immediately after  that, I added the pasta and remaining ingredients.  lMuch better after that.

We LOVED this.  I guesstimated on the garlic as I buy it pre-minced in large jars.  Added a few extra mushrooms--next time a whole 8oz package would definitely be good.  I was worried about the egg fully cooking, but it did (only added one).  This will definitely go into our rotation!

Delicious! Great for an easy, beginner's recipe. I would add some olive oil at the very end to make it a little less dry :)

Pretty good base recipe. I added a pound of chicken breast and upped the cheese to a !/2 cup as well as lumped in a bunch more garlic. I also used mostaciolli noodles instead of spaghetti. Lastly added fresh ground pepper to the finished dish which was quite good as it adds a nice spicy contrast to the umami flavors of the mushrooms and cheese.

I added the egg in with the chicken and onion mushroom mixture instead of the noodles because I left them in the colander in the sink until they were cool. This was a mistake it made the mixture gloopy, but it was still quite tasty.

If I make again I think I would make without chicken as it seems more of a distraction from the rest of the dish than a good addition.

I added bacon and only used one egg.  I never would have thought to add an egg, but it was a great touch.  Yummy recipe!!  We'll do this again.

Even my picky guys liked it. I thought maybe I should have used a little more garlic though.

I changed this up quite a bit, thanks to another reviewer.  I used a whole small onion, turning it golden by cooking in butter and then setting aside.  I used 8 oz. of mushrooms and sauteed, then turned the heat down and added the garlic.  The vegetables need a LOT of seasoning/salt and pepper.  When they were done cooking, I added in 1/2 c. of olive oil and heated before adding to the pasta.

I cooked the pasta per box directions, and before draining, I reserved one cup of the pasta cooking liquid.  After draining, I put the pasta back in the pot and stirred in the eggs.  I added the pasta water back in (makes the pasta creamier), and then added in the hot onions/mushroom/garlic and parmesan cheese.

This was simple and good, a quick meal for the family, not so special or fancy that I would serve for company.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only addition we made was to add marinated artichokes, which we love. We also squeezed a couple of wedges of fresh lemon at the end which brightened the flavor. It would be excellent with chicken or shrimp, but is delicious as a meat-free meal.

I thought it was really good.  I added a little bit of the pasta water as suggested.  Everyone loved it.

Decent quick basic recipe. I like the added protein from the eggs. Next time I might add some spinach and cream to the mushrooms.

This was a pretty fast dish. Will need to reserve some cooking liquid to add - especially if using 1 # of pasta. Added some diced ham & slice of bacon, plus parsley for color. Good weeknight meal.

I liked it.  Very easy and quick to make.  We added some green onions at the end. I also saw a very similar recipe on Lidia's Kitchen and am very pleased with the results.  I see that the recipe doesn't call for salt.  I accidentally over-salted the pasta while it was cooking and it ended up being a great thing :-)
