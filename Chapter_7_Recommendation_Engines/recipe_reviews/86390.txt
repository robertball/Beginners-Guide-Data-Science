Gotta admit, the only reason I tried this is because I didn't believe that strawberries with balsamic vinegar and pepper would taste right.  Boy was I wrong!  My guests and I loved this, especially over vanilla ice cream.  The juice made a great ice cream topping!  Will definitely make this again!!!

I was a little hesitant about this recipe, but I had all of the ingredients on hand, so I gave it a try.  It was SO good!  I was scared about adding the pepper, but it gave it a nice little zing.

I have now made both Balsamic Strawberry recipes on this site and I like this one better. The balsamic vinegar & sugar became almost syrup like after sitting for an hour. I was hesitant to use the black pepper but it was actually very nice.

Absolutely delicious...I really love strawberries and usually just dip them in sugar to eat them.  My husband recently went to costco and came back with 5 pounds of strawberries and I didn't know what to do with them so I went in search of a recipe.  When I found this recipe, I was a bit skeptical...I mean really vinegar marinated strawberries...Well, I made them and they were delicious.  It is now my husbands favorite strawberry recipe; he has requested and I have made it several times since the first batch.  With all this strawberry it did take us several days to eat it, but I found that the longer it sat in the marinade the better it tasted.  So now I marinade it for 2-3 days.  Serve with ice cream, eat alone or just top your favorite anything really.  YUMMY!!!

I have been making a version of this for
years, but use brown sugar in place of the white. I serve it with a spoonful of whipped cream on top. I think it is excellent.

I was shocked at how well this went over.  With over 45 people who tried it, only one didn't love it... and he said he would have, if he could get over the fact that it was Balsamic Vinegar. 

We served it over sliced French Vanilla Pound Cake from Sam's, but I'd be interested in trying it on crackers with cream cheese.

Ours did marinate more than 4 hours, but still, phenomenal!

I tried this last night over ice cream and was the only one that would eat it and I only ate it so it didn't go to waste.  We didn't like this recipe and will not be making it again.

Delicious! I have made a similar recipe to this one before but like this better. The kids went nuts over this. Also, Michael Chicarello (sp) just did a show on this using the same mixture incorporated into vanilla ice cream. I bet that would be terrific.

This recipe is a great starter. I like to quarter the berries and pour the whole mixture over a big bowl of baby spinach. Top with toasted almonds and you have a delicious summer salad. I often omit the extra sugar, especially if the berries are well ripened.

These were really good.  The sugar/vinegar/pepper combination gave the berries a sweetness with a slight tang.  They were perfect over vanilla ice cream.  Personally, I would have liked to taste a little more of the vinegar, but the rest of my family enjoyed it the way it was.  Great way to serve this delicious fruit.

Okay, I tried these because I wanted to know what the big deal was about strawberries and balsamic vinegar.  It would really help if someone described the taste instead of just saying "delicious," or "terrible".  I don't drink (alcohol), so the taste to me was very unpleasant.  It tasted like strawberries steeped in wine.  Not something I want to experience again, but at least I tried it, and I know what it tastes like... and if you are curious, at least here you got a description.

Oh so sophistcated. and oh so healthy. Wonderful blend of flavors, complex, yet meld together perfectly. You can easily use splenda in this recipe to knock down the calories even more (use half as much as you would sugar). What a treat for those foodies watcing what they eat!!!!!

Really love this recipe.  Next time I would omit the black pepper.  I doubled everything in the recipe EXCEPT the pepper and it was still way too strong. I also used Spenda in place of sugar.  Love the flavor of the vinegar and sugar together.

I was shocked that Balsamic Vinegar and Strawberries went together, but as long as you leave them a couple hours, the sharpness of the vinegar is almost gone. If you leave them overnight in the fridge, you can easily refresh them with 1/2 to 1 Tbsp of the Balsamic Vinegar. Yumm

I was completely skeptical about this recipe, but we wanted to try something different than the same-old-same-old you always make with strawberries.  HOLY COW, was this a hit!  The family devoured this over icecream, and even licked the bowl clean!  I am going to try it as a topping on my next cheesecake.  AWESOME!!!!!!!

This is a delicous way to serve strawberries. Just a word of caution, DON'T USE CHEAP BALSAMIC VINEGAR. It's like cooking with wine, if it's not good enough to drink don't cook with it.

Suprisingly delicious! Very good on a hot summer day when you just want something different. The berries offset the acididy of the vinegar, which offsets the tartness of the berries. You HAVE to try it once. It's cheap and quick to make, so you're not out on anything. This one has it's place in my recipe box with love.

perfect.  I would just recommend adjusting the pepper grinder to 'fine' so that the cracked pepper isn't all you're getting with each bite.  Served mine with pound cake.  It was so good!  Thanks for the post.

One of the most elegant and delicious strawberry recipes you will ever try. The color was gorgeous and the flavor combination was wonderful. I served these strawberries at brunch, drizzled over sliced melon and plated with vegetable strata. Outstanding!

Simple and divine!  I love it when something so simple and easy delivers excellent results.  The balance of tangy vinegar to sweet sugar to sour strawberries is perfect.  And what a fun surprise!  You would never think that vinegar and strawberries would be friends, but they actually improve the flavor.  I always use this if my strawberries aren't the nicest...those horrid white/pink ones you get in the winter.

every summer, i mix up strawberries with balsamic vinegar and white sugar for a snack but i didn't realize letting it sit for an hour makes a BIG difference! and i never ate it with ice cream before too, so it was quite ecstatic when i first tried this recipe. the best part is, i had leftovers so i poured them over waffles for breakfast the next day! best waffles ever.

Unbelievable flavor! Only had a pint of strawberries but had 1 cup of blueberries so I added them, too.  Instead of white sugar used brown sugar.  Served over crepes filled with cream chese.  Finished with a dusting of powdered sugar.  Will make for 4th of July as a "Red, White & Blue" dish.  Outstanding!

I usually make this into a reduction. I boil balsamic vinegar and sugar and then reduce the heat and simmer. It then turns into an awesome syrup. I drizzle that syrup on chicken, or fruit with icecream. You can drizzle it on ice cream alone also. It has a nice molassesy taste. This is quite popular in Italy and if you use an aged balsamic vinegar it tastes even better.

I wasn't sure I liked this at first but the taste grew on me.  This would be a great way to serve plain strawberries without the usual whipped cream, etc.  Blueberries could also be added in.

Easy to make - my quality of Balsamic Vinegar wasn't very high grade so I am looking forward to making it again with a better vinegar. Definitely add the black pepper!

I have been using balsamic vinegar  (typically one of the gourmet flavored varieties from Fiore) on berries for a number of years now.  I especially like to make this with mixed strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries.   The black pepper is a surprisingly nice addition!

We really enjoyed the strawberries marinated in the balsamic vinegar. We served it over Cottage Pudding Cake, also from this website with freshly whipped cream. An unusual and tasty way to serve strawberry shortcake.

These were delicious!  I started with about 1/4 a cup of sugar for 2 pounds of strawberries, but kept the balsamic at the stated amount.  After an hour or so, I stirred them up again and tasted to see if it needed more sugar.  I added about another 1/8 of a cup to taste.  We had these over angel food cake and they were awesome!

I served this alongside edy's light vanilla bean ice cream.  It is delicious.  A couple friends I served it to, who normally do not like vinegar, said it was delicious.  No one could believe it had black pepper in it.  Just make sure you let the strawberries macerate for at least 1 hour so the flavors come together.  Will be a "healthy" dessert favorite to serve to company for a long time coming.

It was different.  I don't think it was better than plain fresh strawberries with perhaps a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  DH was not crazy about it.

I have to admit that this rating is based on some changes.  I only used about 2.5 tbs of sugar, and I used only 1 tbs of strawberry balsamic vinegar.

The flavor of these strawberries is good, but there is nothing  fabulous and spectacular. I marinated strawberries for 2 hours and the flavor was just like the strawberries sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. I don`t see the purpose of this recipe. The combination isn`t bad, but the strawberries by themselves is better, in my opinion. As the previous reviewer, I can say we ate them, but weren`t amazed at them.

AMAZING! I had no idea Balsamic and Strawberries went so well together! I was hesitant to try but I'm glad I did!!!! I did substitute the sugar for Splenda granular but it still came out amazing :) Put over ice cream and this is pure bliss!! Simple and elegant! Will definitely keep making!

Made this for my parents, who said they liked it. I personally did not: it tasted... well... of vinegar. The strawberries did retain the "strawberry" flavor, but only the "tart" part... the "sweet" part was gone. And since the "sweet" part is the part I like...

What an interesting dessert! I just had to try it.  I served the strawberry mixture over vanilla ice cream.  With a bit of hesitation, I also sprinkled freshly ground pepper.  Of course I served it without broadcasting the ingredients.   It was incredible , we just loved it!  I can’t wait to make it again to serve to others.

Delicious! I was rather tentative about the whole process and my mother was convinced it would be a train wreck - but one bite and the tune changed! I made no changes, besides doing 3 servings, rather 6, so I would be able to make another batch later

This is surprisingly good! I will use this often! The balsamic gives the berry a more intense flavor than just using the norm sugar mix. I love the extra flavor that the balsamic gives any dessert dish. I will use this often. Don't be afraid of the pepper, it enhances and blends well, even on sweets!!

You HAVE to try this!  The balsamic vinegar gives it a wonderful flavor.  Don't let this one ingredient stop you... you will be SO surprised!  Let it sit for 2 days and then spoon over ice cream (use a very creamy vanilla)  My friends couldn't believe there was vinegar in it.  Wonderful recipe!! Would make the most excellant strawberry shortcake.

I had been wanting to try this recipe for quite some but with the prices of berries, I had put it off. Well, it is strawberry season in Plant City (the strawberrry mecca). Paid $4 for a flat or 2 pounds! So, I had to try it! Wow! I followed the recipe exactly. Thought I was reading it wrong when adding the sugar but it came out perfect! A perfect balance! Will try over French Vanilla ice cream next time.

This is really yummy.  I cut the recipe down to just make a serving for myself.  I used homemade vanilla sugar and this was delicious.  It would be good over pancakes or ice cream.

What a terrific blend of flavors! For a variation I added peaches to the strawberries and cut them into small pieces. Spread some brie or other soft cheese on a cracker and top with a spoonful of the "relish". Top with a sprinkle of the fresh ground pepper.
 This relish also is great when slightly drained (so it's not too runny) and poured over a brie wheel.

I was very skeptical but it worked.  Had to add more sugar because I over did it with the balsamic vinegar.  Served over vanilla ice cream is the only way to go!

I liked it but my husband said it was nothing extra. We probably should have put it on top of ice cream or pound cake like a few of the other readers. Not sure if I'll be keeping this recipe around. Thanks anyway.

This was absolutely fabulous.  Fantastic recipe.  Be sure to use a good aged balsamic and don't skip the pepper (used fresh ground).  The blend of sweet and tart with the sharpness of the pepper is outstanding.  Do it right and wash it down with a nice merlot.

Barely made it to my table! Lol. I love balsamic on fruit, and with a little sugar, the juice it made was so delicious! I really enjoyed the addition of fresh ground pepper- another ingredient I love. I agree with the reviewer who said to use good balsamic. I used espresso balsamic on mine and served them with dinner- no cake or ice cream! I admit, I didn't wait for them to marinate before I started eating them. As soon as that sugar dissolved,I was in there! These were amazing, but if you are concerned about the sugar you could easily cut it in half if you are using a good balsamic.

This recipe is very good. It can be improved and made more healthy if you had Stevia instead of sugar.
One small packet of Stevia equals 2 teaspoons of sugar. I also put a little bit of salt on the strawberries as they set in order to release the juices.

1 teaspoon of Stevia equals

Like so many others here, I was skeptical. My boyfriend, who loves strawberries, was against me trying out this recipe in the first place, because he thought it would ruin the berries. 
We both - and all of our guests - enjoyed the result a lot, though (ate it with and without vanilla ice cream). We didn't notice the pepper much (noticed too late that we didn't have any black pepper to grind and used the last remnants of an old glass of ground pepper instead, which probably was the problem there). The balsamico taste kind of blends into the background, and instead, the combination of balsamico and sugar really brings out the strawberry flavour.
Next time, we'll try serving this with fresh mint.

Delicious by itself, with whipped cream, or on a bagel with cream cheese.  :)  It's also good on a spinach salad.

I doubled the balsamic vinegar, and I forgot to add the pepper.  I'll have to try that next time.

Oh my, this was delicious! I can imagine this only works well with a really good quality balsamic though. Some folks weren't too keen on the idea so we made most of the berries with just sugar, then the rest with this recipe (minus the black pepper) & believe it or not, these berries were actually sweeter (but not overly so) & tasted more like strawberries than the plain ol' sugared ones! Love it, love it, love it!

This makes for a great topping on ice cream or even sweet bread (like a strawberry shortcake). I also mixed it into plain Greek yogurt. It didn't keep very well, though.

Very delicious, quick and easy recipe.  The 1st time I made it, I used 1/4 cup Splenda as the recipe states, but it just had too strong of the Splenda after taste.  The next time I made it, I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar.  Turned out great and is one of my husbands favorite desserts!

I let my strawberries soak for 3 hours and the flavor was amazing.  The flavor of the strawberries was enhanced.  Will make this one again.

This was a huge hit at my July 4th party.  I served it over a light angel food cake and skipped the pepper. Everyone loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Such a quick, easy and tasty dessert.

I don't use pepper, and don't really measure... but I just splash a little vinegar on strawberries and add some sugar. I love to add nectarines too, SO good!

So yummy with a dollop of whipped cream! This was too much sauce for that amount of berries although I saved the rest for latter.

I loved it but my family thought it was too vinegary and suggested only 1 tbsp of vinegar.  I may try that variation next time to satisfy them.

This worked well and I would make it again, though I would make a few changes next time. I only had brown sugar so I used that and it worked - I'm sure white is just as good. I let it sit for about two hours, which was plenty. I would have given it 5 stars, except I found that the strawberries without pepper on them tasted better. Though I'm glad I got to experience the flavor, I'd recommend trying it on one berry before going over the whole bowl). Also, before mixing I cut the berries in half as directed by the recipe, but I wish I'd sliced them more thinly for better presentation (they didn't slice as well after soaking).

This recipe really didn't sound very appealing but I had to try it out.  It's actually pretty good!  I tried it before adding the pepper and thought it was okay and seemed to have a slight vinegar-y after taste that I didn't care for.  I later found that after adding the pepper, it takes that weird after taste away.  It grows on you.  Try it!

These were surprisingly delicious.  The tanginess of the vinegar complements the fruit nicely.  My strawberries were very sweet.  Next time I get a batch of tart strawberries I will cut back on the vinegar just a touch.  I didn't add the pepper this time, but will try it next time.  Thanks!

Although the recipe sounds very strange, it's awesome!  It doesn't really change the taste of the strawberries at all.  It just really enhances their natural flavor :)

I made this last year for a potluck.  People went CRAZY over it.  I have made the recipe several times now, and it is one of my favourites on the whole site.  I like extra pepper myself.  Yay, strawberry season is coming up again!  Even mid-winter hothouse berries seem to taste great this way.

This is so easy and quick. I tried it because I love the ingredients and they sounded great together. This is a super way to use up strawberries that are getting soft, because you can't tell! Problem is, I never make enough.

this were great I made a bowl full tonight after dinner. Only thing different was I tossed the strawberries in the sugar then poured the vinegar over, stuck them in the fridge for 30 minutes. My fiance and I gobbled up them up, they were delicious. I will be making these again.

I just ate these on their own, the balsamic & sugar made a very tasty syrup that I can visualize being great over vanilla ice cream.  Maybe I used too much pepper - think I'll skip that ingredient next time.

I have always heard that this was a fab way to do strawberries so thought i would give it a shot. my husband saw me putting the cracked pepper on them before serving and said what the...? lol that is NOT something i am going to like...he had 2 bowls. I doubled the recipe to serve 4. You can also serve vanilla icecream with this b/c the sauce is DELISH!

Yummy! Try it on pound cake or on a french baguette slathered with marscaponi cheese. It sometimes takes more vinegar than the recipe calls for to get the right amount of tang.

Excellent over ice cream!  And don't forget to add the pepper.  It does not interfere with the taste of the strawberries, rather it only acts to enhance the flavor of the balsamic vinegar for a wonderful tasting dessert!

This was such a simple and tasty after dinner dessert. Loved by my husband and I!  I served the strawberries cool over shortcakes made with Bisquick...yummy and elegant all in one. I'll use for a quick "gourmet" type dessert at my next dinner get-together...and perhaps serve over sugar-free vanilla ice cream.

This was just ok in my book. I marinated my berries in the Balsamic overnight but they still didnt seem to have much of a balsamic taste. I served it over store bought pound cake with some whipped cream. Pepper definately adds an interesting twist on the flavor, so dont omit it. All in all an okay recipe.

Surprisingly, the vinegar/sugar/pepper mixture gave these strawberries the perfect flavor -- sweet and tangy. My guests loved them, and my boyfriend said these strawberries tasted better than his mom's.  Coming from him, THAT's a compliment!

there is a recipe just like this in the ABS diet book. Instead of pepper, try it with basil one time and see the difference. i added in frozen raspberries and blueberries and then just let them dethaw in the juices in the fridge. AMAZING!

I've been wanting to try strawberries and balsamic for a long time and I'm so glad I did. It's fantastic! I was hesitant about the black pepper but it gives it a perfect, unexpected kick. I'd love to try this on angel food cake or vanilla yogurt.

This was very delicious!  I made it last night to serve to a group of last-minute guests, and everyone loved it.  The berries had a very nice color to them and tasted fantastic.  The pepper adds a nice touch, so don't skip that step even though it seems a bit strange.  We had the strawberries by themselves, but I'm already planning to add them to some vanilla ice cream the next time I make it.

A lovely and unusual recipe.  I've been eating strawberries with pepper for years but the addition of balsamic vinegar gave it wonderful flavour(although don't use a heavy hand). I marinated for a couple hours so the berries could absorb the flavour.  Very good over cake.

You should definitely try this!  It is so simple, but delightfully delicious.  The pepper and balsamic vinegar compliment the fruit wonderfully and form almost a syrup when combined with the strawberries and sugar.  Best of all, it is so easy to make!  The added bonus: when your family/guests rave about the dessert (as my Mom and brother did), you can shock them by telling them the ingredients.  I served this over store-bought pound cake and topped with freshly whipped, slightly sweetened cream.

I made some minor changes in the recipe. I used more balsamic vinegar (I like the taste) amd added 1/4 cup demerara sugar instead. I marinated it for 7 hours, and the strawberries still did not pick up the flavor. I reduced the remaining liquid and it was amazing over ice cream. The strawberries with pepper were the weakest part. Next time I will mash the strawberries and add it to the liquid.

Different, simple and delicious! I didn't have the quantity of straberries that the recipe calls for, so I added and subtracted the quantity of the ingredients based on my taste. Turned out wonderful. Thanks for saring.

This was absolutely lovely.  I forgot the black pepper and it was great without it but I also think it would have been a nice addition.

I would never have thought to add balsamic vinegar to Strawberries - but it's wonderful!

Still can't believe the result of vinegar & strawberries!  I didn't tell my husband the ingredients because he doesn't care for balsamic... he loved it (over angels food cake) - next time definitely over vanilla ice cream.

Simple, yet elegant enough to serve to your guests. If you're looking for a change of pace, this is it! Don't let the ingredients scare you, this really does all work together!  I used half the amount of sugar (personal preference), but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

I've made this for years minus the black pepper and have always gotten rave reviews.     Measurements are always variable based on ripeness/sweetness of the strawberries.    Keeps well in fridge for several days (longer marinate, softer berries) and freezes perfectly as well.    Berries too soft...... quick turn in blender for a very simple compote.     I use it over so many things and often will mix in some blueberries.  The syrup alone is easily as good.     Guess I'll give the pepper a shot next time!

If you can find Chocolate Balsamic Vinegar, I recommend trying that -- it's wonderful!

But I have to admit that I haven't yet tried pepper too.

2.20.17   Florida strawberries are in season right now, and this is always a go-to dessert/snack for me.  The only thing that I do differently is sub Splenda brown sugar for the white sugar.  And don’t forget that freshly-ground pepper because that and the balsamic are the unique ingredients that make this special.  Garnished with a spoonful of vanilla Greek yogurt and a sprig of fresh mint.

I used brown sugar rather than white and cut amount by about 20%.  The syrup still was plentiful but not too sweet.  Served on vanilla ice cream but will try chocolate next.

Fabulous!!! Made exactly as written, including pepper to taste. Put the berries together about 12 hours before serving, plenty of time for the flavors to develop. Agree with others who said the recipe tastes better when made a few hours ahead. Our guests included a 4 year old who loved the "sour" strawberries. Served as part of a dessert buffet including brownies, pound cake, ice cream and whipped cream - giving  everyone the option to put their dessert together as they wished.  Will definitely make again.

I love strawberries and balsamic vinegar, so I expected to love this, but it seemed kind of weird when I ate it by itself, though it was decent with plain yogurt mixed in.  In the future, I think I'll just drizzle a little balsamic over the berries; there just seemed to be too much of that.

I followed someone else's recommendation to purée some strawberries. I added the sugar (half sugar and half Splenda,) the pepper, and very high quality balsamic vinegar (straight from Italy) to the food processor. Then I poured the purée over quartered strawberries. Amazing!

So glad I tried this! the ingredients sounded kind of crazy to me, and I don't even care much for balsamic vinegar, but WOW! the end result was fantastic.  Just ate this by itself, it didn't last long enough for me to try over ice cream but I will do that next time.

I had Strawberries that needed to be eaten and happened to have seen 3 cooking shows that all raved about this fruit with Balsamic vinegar.
My husband thought the combination sounded horrible, but then I made this recipe and he was totally amazed at how delicious it was. We will definitely have these over and over again Yummy !!

This sounds so wrong yet I tried it because  it was so wrong.  This is the easiest and best tasting dish I've had in many years . I made it for my parents who have no clue what balsamic is and it's my job when the berries are ripe. I can add a twist as well . Purée the ripest/ ugliest berries with the balsamic and sugar. It matters not how many berries. The taste of berries in the syrup is the goal.

This was surprisingly easy and delicious! I wasn't too convinced I would like the balsamic vinegar but I tried it anyway. In the end, you don't taste the smell of the vinegar, if that makes any sense. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I never got to top it on the ice cream...hubby ate it straight just like that!

This one of my favorite ways to eat strawberries, but I cannot stand grocery store balsamic poured on food. I only cook with cheap balsamics.  I go to shops that sell only oils and vinegars and buy the very best balsamic they have.

Made this last night and going to make it again tonight!  Served the berries with slices of angel food cake and whipped cream.  Altered the recipe a little - only used 1 tablespoon of sugar and used marionberry basalmic vinegar.  Yummy!

I have made this several times now, and love it.  If there are leftovers, they go real good with French toast in the morning.

SO DELICIOUS and SO EASY! I like this much better than plain strawberries on ice cream.  I added this strawberry mixture to a bowl with pound cake chunks, ice cream, and whipped cream - AMAZING.  I didn't use the pepper because I don't really like much of a pepper flavor.  This is perfect for using with slightly busted strawberries - the ones that don't look pretty and presentable.  When you chop them up and put them in the dark vinegar, they all come out looking deep red and pretty.  I will definitely make this in the future for summer BBQ party dessert!

Balsamic vinegar is wonderful with strawberries. I use brown sugar instead of white. Very simple recipe and can be used many ways.  Very good topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I just served this with a scoop of warm farro and sliced almonds for breakfast.

A fun, surprising, easy, tasty, and unique dessert to show off to guests. Looks beautiful with a sprig of mint in small white dessert bowls. For the time/effort it takes vs. the rewards, it's one of the best returns on investment.

I was curious, so I scaled this down for a single serving with 3 oz of strawberries and tried it with vanilla ice cream. I was a little put off by the occasional whiff of vinegar while eating, but overall it was delicious, just the right amount of sweet. I would definitely make this again, it makes a great homemade strawberry topping!

Very delicious.  My husband was skeptical at first, however when he tried it (sans pepper) he was very amazed and loved it, however, he wouldn't try the pepper on it.  I enjoyed it both ways.

Update (within minutes:)  My husband won't stop raving about the strawberries.  "Those are just the best strawberries." "Amazing" and on and on.

Poured the strawberries over pound cake slices and served with ice cream.  My guests loved it and couldn't believe that balsamic vinegar & pepper tasted that good with strawberries. Thanks for sharing

As other reviewers I was hesitant about adding the pepper but all the ingredients blended well. I served the strawberries over vanilla ice cream and it was a hit. My husband kept going back for more. This recipe was so easy and is a real keeper.

i've had balsamic vinegar strawberries before in a restaurant served w/ vanilla ice cream. that's what i did today along with a chocolate souffle. my bf was skeptical but the sourness of the strawberries went well with the sweet richness of the souffle and the hot souffle went well with the cold berries and ice cream

I had really high hopes for this recipe.  I love balsamic vinegar and buy the best our markets offer, so I was good to go.  Made 1/2 a batch and tried one but ended up spitting it out.  My husband didn't say anything when I fed him one but later said it was not bad.

These berries were a nice change of pace for us! My boyfriend ate his over vanilla frozen yogurt. I was suprised at how nicely the balsamic vinegar complemented the berries. Not sure if I will make it again, as I just love strawberries plain, but it was a new taste for us that we enjoyed.

I made this with Truvia and cut the recipe down. I thought the pepper should be optional as I felt it detracted from the dish. I didn't find a need to let the berries marinate. Top with whipped cream, a very lo cal and insanely delicious dessert.

Who would have ever thought to put these ingredients together???  This was a pleasant surprise of a recipe.  We ate it over ice cream first and the next day my daughter and I devoured the rest right out of the tupperware with two spoons.  This was an interesting recipe and nice for something out of the ordinary.  Thanks!

Well, I tried, but everyone wanted to know what was  "in" the strawberries, and I didn't even get to add the pepper yet!  I thought it was a little better than that!

Very good. You really can't taste the vinegar like you would think.

Sounds like it would be good, though honestly I just put a couple spurts of SWEET balsamic vinegar over my sliced strawberries, shake it in a bowl and it as is...so delicious and simple!

I'm kinda obsessed with Pinkberry (tangy yogurt chain in LA) and the mixture of Balsamic vinegar and the strawberries over the ice cream was the right mix of sweet and tangy.

It's a great dessert for the summer.

This was ok.  I served them with vanilla ice cream.  My family was not a fan of the vinegar taste.

This was easy and delicious - a big hit over ice cream. Sweet with just the right amount of tart. 
We used Sweet Cream flavored ice cream from Marble Slab...
Brown sugar would also be good in this recipe.
