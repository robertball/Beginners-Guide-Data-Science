I did not have high expectations for this pie, but oh my goodness - literally!! I used sugar free pie filling and baked it in an 8 inch square pan (so more of a slab pie). The cranberries blended in so nicely (I had been concerned they would overpower the apple, but not even close) and the flavor was excellent!! I loved the crumb crust and topping. Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe - it's so tasty and easy! I quite enjoyed having the simplicity of using the same stuff for the crust as for the topping and actually prefer the taste and crunchiness of a crumble crust instead of a pastry crust. 
I didn't have cranberries so I had to leave that out, but would definitely like to try adding them next time.
And I made my own apple filling from another recipe on this site, which also included lemon juice and cinnamon (I only had fresh apples), so I would think that if you are using the canned stuff, the lemon juice and cinnamon are a wonderful addition.
