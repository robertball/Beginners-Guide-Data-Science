If you make this as instructed be prepared for an inferno in your mouth.  I think the flavours are too complex for such a mild fish.

This recipe was way, WAY too spicy for us and we're native Texans who like things hot and spicy. When we started eating and realized how hot this recipe was, we had to cook something else for our 4-year-old daughter so that she didn't burn her mouth.

This is the first time I tried tilapia. Had it with ranch flavored mashed cauliflower and a green salad. It was great. Will use this one again

This was just not good.  The chili and cayenne were totally overwhelming, and there was definitely something missing.  Squeezing orange juice over the cooked fish made it edible, but far, far, far from good.  Don't make this.

I used this recipe for fish tacos. It was good, maybe a little greasy. I used 24 ounces of fish instead of the 16 called for. I also cut back on the cayenne by half. All and all its a good recipe.

Sorry, but this didn't work at all for me.  I couldn't bring myself to use 1T. cayenne pepper--only used 1tea. & still wasn't happy with the taste results.  Maybe I did something wrong---but otherwise, it was really easy to put together for a quick meal.

After reading the other reviews about the degree of spice I tweeked it. The trick is to cut everything back to 1tsp. I think the originator maybe had a typo.
Instead of baking it, I grilled it over mesquite charcoal. Very Good! Very delicate flakey fish that's awesome with a nice white wine, cold beer or sweet tea!

I wasn't too precise on the measurements but it came out fantastic! The cayenne pepper adds a nice kick and you can taste the hint of orange. Very quick and easy.

We cut all the seasoning measurements down to teaspoons, from tablespoons, with the exception of 1/4t cayenne and 1T orange zest.  We would probably use a little more cayenne next time, but this was very good.

It was a little spicy but we loved it. Might use a little less of the mixture next time.

Delicious! Moist, lots of flavor.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I did reduce the cayenne pepper to 3/4 tsp and that was perfect for our taste.  I would add a pinch of salt next time, but otherwise it is a wonderful recipe.  A keeper!
