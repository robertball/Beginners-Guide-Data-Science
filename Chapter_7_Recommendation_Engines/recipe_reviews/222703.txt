I thought the fennel flavor a bit overwhelming so I did an even balance of fennel to potatoes and used leeks in place of the spring onions.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on, it makes an interesting texture.  If you can make this ahead of time the flavors really benefit from refrigeration.  I think my favorite thing about this soup is it is so versatile.  Serve it warm or cold!  It tastes good either way.

Made this with the contents of our CSA box this week, and I was surprised that I and my husband loved it!  Couldn't get the four year old on board, but she is not a potato lover.  I blended it so it was nice and creamy.  Will be making this again!

Yum! I was looking for something to do with the fennel from the CSA, and found this recipe. Didnt have any scallions on hand, so substituted yellow onion. Delish! Even my seven year old enjoyed a bowl...

Great way to warm up and use some of the more esoteric things from our produce deliveries. Sweet, spicy, delicious.
