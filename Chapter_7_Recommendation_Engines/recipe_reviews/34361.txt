We LOVE Halushki(how we spell it)!  This has been a staple in our house since before I was born- now my kids love it too!
In order for this dish to taste SUPREME you have to fry the cabbage with the onion.  In fact I put the cabbage in the pan for about 10 minutes before I add the onion.  Let the cabbage lightly brown for the most tasty result.  Egg noodles are great but you can use Farfalle, Rotini or Elbows.  ENJOY this comfort food! We tend to use a lot of pepper and salt for this recipe as well as garlic powder.

I love this classic Czech dish. So simple, cheap and comforting. However, I do agree that you should definitely sauté the cabbage along with the onion instead of steaming it separately. Also, the addition of a dollop of sour cream can't be beat. For a heartier dish with additional flavor, we also love to add some sliced kielbasa to sauté in with the onion and cabbage.

A favorite of us Western PA folks! Around here its not holuski if its not dripping in butter. 1/4 cup is NOT enough, unless you want to be eating plain cooked noodles. Start with at least 1 stick of SALTED butter to saute the onions. Use a stock pot when doing this and add the cabbage a little at a time cause it won't cook down in a timely fashion if you add it all at once. Add the noodles into the cabbage and stir in pot and add more butter as needed until it's all coated to your liking. I usually use a total of 1 1/2 sticks to 2 sticks of salted butter. This is also how my Czech grandmother made it.

I have always LOVED this recipe, maybe because I am Czech, however my Babi (who is a Czech immigrant) has never prepared it for me. The taste for this dish must be in my blood! I always fry the onion and cabbage together instead of steaming the cabbage... to me it tastes better this way, and you don't have an extra pot to clean. I always eat it with a dollop of sour cream on top... adds a creamy texture. So simple, yet SO delicious! My very American boyfriend loves it, too (although he likes it with Cheddar on the top). Prosim!

I love Holuski, but I found the cabbage has more flavor if when you fry the butter and onion you also fry the cabbage.  Its also not as soggy.

One of the most unique and delicious Czech dishes that I have tasted.  My Czech/Ukrainian version is a bit different - it includes diced bacon and browned sourkraut.  Always receives fantastic compliments from those who try it for the first time.

I love, love, love halushki...takes me back to my Western Pennsylvania / Ukrainian roots.  However, my father and his family always added either bacon or "fatback" to this recipe.  It makes it even more amazing!

Easy to throw together last minute, but could be helped with the addition of other vegetables (for color/presentation) and cayenne.

Absolutely delicious.  My slovak grandmother made this for me everytime I came to stay with her when I was a child.  When I got the craving for it, I came here and I'm so happy I found this recipe.  I also sauteed the onion with the cabbage and added more butter than called for.  I also used quite a bit of salt and pepper.  Next time I will take the advice of the other reviewers and add some polish sausage (kielbasa).  My grandmother used to serve the kielbasa separately but I think it would be fantastic mixed in.  I made and ate this all by myself for lunch...YUMMY!!

Kimberly -- yummie.  Reminds me of wedding receptions in western Pennsylvania where I grew up.  I sometimes use sauerkraut too, like the other reviewer.  But my polish grandmother always used the cabbage and a ton of pepper.  I am looking for a recipe to make the noodles homemade.  If you have one, please post it.

Hubby really loved this but I did take others advice and doctored it up with sliced kielbasa and more seasonings. It doesn't get much easier than this. Thank you Kimberly!

I had never heard of this dish.  Glad I tried it.  So good!  I did what other reviewers suggested and sauteed the cabbage and onion.  No steaming.  Also added a dollop of sour cream to each serving.  I used bow tie pasta because that's what I had.  I like this much more than mac and cheese and it's easier, too.

It's like noodle perogi's!  I accidentally used 12oz of egg noodles and it would be better  to just use 8 oz because then the deliciousness of the onion and cabbage would be denser (or use more cabbage and onion!).  I ended up using 1/2 c butter and I also tossed in 5 cloves of crushed garlic and some sausages (I like it without the sausage better).  Also SOUR CREAM IS A MUST!  My 5 year old is on his second bowl already!

I like the cabbage steamed down with a stick of butter instead of water.  No draining necessary. INSTEAD of Sour Cream...you HAVE to try with Cottage Cheese. Whole family favorite..

This is a really great recipe!!  I have been making it for little over a year now and originally got the recipe from my boyfriend who's great grandparents brought the recipe from Czechoslovakia.  I love it because it has such great flavor and is so simple to make!!

This is a pretty traditional recipe, my mother-in-law was slovak, the family all grew up on holushki, still a special reunion trest! At home, we throw in sliced smoked sausage for a complete meal, Norma would never have allowed that, but it's easy and yummy!
Definately saute the cabbage and add the onions, it adds a different dimension to the dish! We always use the kluski noodles or frozen Reames, they hold up well and add a better flavor than egg noodles to us.

Satisfying, easy, and I think it cost about $3 to make :o) I think I'll add garlic next time. I also would like more cabbage/onion and less pasta to keep it a little lighter. But will make again for sure.

Really good, but I agree that frying in butter really adds the flavor.  I used 1.5 sticks unsalted and 1.5 onions and just a 1/2 a head of cabbage, shredded.  I also used spaghetti noodles.  I am not a big user of salt, but I will say you need to be generous with the seasonings.  I will make this again!

This was Wonderful!!! I Loved it! I made it because I had some leftover cabbage from another dinner I made. It's just me, so I don't use a whole head for anything. I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and basil. I followed the advice of some of the others and sauteed the cabbage with the onion. I will definitely make this again.

WOW!  I had never heard of this dish before today but it is going to be added to my recipe repertoire.  Simple and so delicious.  I didn't have egg noodles so used some angel hair pasta, sauted my cabbage with the butter and onions (as suggested by other reviewers), and added some Italian sausage (because it's what I had on hand), and it was a delightful meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Have made this for many years, but I always saute the onions and cabbage together until they are a bit carmelized and browned...  more flavor, less work.  The salt and pepper are key. The kind of food my Croatian mother cooked, simple but delicious and a great change of pace from potatoes or rice. YUM!

I make this at home all the time only I fry up an entire package of bacon first then coat the cabbage in the renderings until it wilts. I finshes with the cooked egg noodles. I've never tried it with the onion or sourcream... Maybe next time!

Awhile back - I made Bubble n Squeak from this site - which is essentially fried cabbage and ham and my family loved it.  When I saw this - I was excited b/c adding noodles makes that cabbage "go farther."  As written - I think it needs more seasonings - and although I added some onion/garlic powders to the cabbage saute (AND took the advice of adding kielbasa) - it still needed a little more "BAM!"  I would make this again - it's very economical, super easy and a fast meal to put together and it IS tasty - but next time, I'll just be more liberal with the powders - OR maybe use more cabbage? I used a bag of the pre-cut coleslaw and it still seemed like the noodle to cabbage ratio was too high - remember cabbage seems to shrink by half once cooked...maybe I just need more cabbage and less noodles?  Most of the taste is coming from the cabbage anyways.  Either way - plan to keep to play around with.  Thanks Kimberly!

Plain and simple comfort food. We're not Czech, but this is so good. I too sauteed the cabbage with the onions, and I fried up some turkey polish sausages and mixed it in with the noodles. I only seasoned with salt and pepper, but next time I might add some red pepper flakes or paprika. Anyway, thanks for the simple recipe, we really enjoyed it.

Delicious!  I did use a bit more butter and salt...and cheated a bit and used the cole slaw blend of cabbage since it was already cut up.  Even my 10 year old gave it 2 thumbs up!

I recently had the most delicious Halusky in a farmer's market in Prague. They had bacon in it and it really was an excellent flavour. Also the egg noodles would be best homemade (softer texture but still holds together), and the short, cylindrical type work best in my opinion. But bacon is the key.

We really enjoyed this. I fried everything in butter, and added chopped ham for some protein. Even my kids ate it. Definitely a keeper for a cold night. Very satisfying!

Great recipe...I had this for the first time at a family party and loved it so much I came home to find the recipe.  I cooked the cabbage and onion together and used way more butter then called for! Yummy but not very healthy - this will be a rare treat! Thanks for sharing

Absolutely delicious!!!  My spouse I and enjoyed this dish so much that after finishing off the first batch, it was requested for dinner the next day!  I fried the cabbage and added 4 cloves of garlic and garlic powder.  I will get much use out of this recipe.

Good basic recipe. Easy to make, too. A little bland (although I did saute onions and cabagge together), but that comes with the cuisine. Overall, it's a good dish for those who don't like a lot of herbs/spices. I added tomatoes and bay leaf and let everything cook together, and, in my opinion, it was much better. But then, again, I'm not Czech! :)

My sister made this for us on Christmas...mmmmm is all anyone could say!! When eating some leftovers, though there weren't many, I added some sour cream to it...what a nice change--it almost tasted like cabbage pierogies all cut up!! OOOh, what an idea and an easier way to get that great taste.

I made this as a side dish for my book club meeting when we read the book 'The Prague Sonata'.  Everyone complemented me on it.  I took people's recommendation on sauteeing the cabbabe, but I did steam it first to soften it, then added it to the sauteeing onions.  Made it with wide egg noodles, but the bow ties probably look prettier.  This is a good way to get more vegetables with pasta - more cabbage, less pasta!

Made this a second time tonight, with grilled country style pork ribs. I add a couple shakes of powered cloves, a Tbl or two of honey, and several splashes of apple cider vinegar. Also lots of salt and pepper, beginning with a little while stir frying the onion and cabbage in a full stick (half c) of butter, as others here have noted it makes it taste better and less steps and pots to clean. SO delicious -tried it tonight with a dollop of sour cream on top...mmmm.

I added 1/2 cup of cream and basil along with the kielbasa, I used red onions to add more color.  I "boiled" the cabbage, onions, cream, butter and basil till very tender and the cream almost boiled off.  Hubby said that this was so GOOD, he can't wait for me to make it again and has asked me to make it for Christmas :-)

The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because my Czech Grandma made it best (of course). We've always sauteed the onions and cabbage together and added lots more butter. Gram also added potatoes or kielbasa to make it a little more stick-to-your-ribs hearty. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this a 4 star rating because I was the only one in my family who liked it.  I am of Irish/German heritage and I thought it was a great comfort food. I used a red cabbage and added a pound of bulk italian sausage.  I also used frozen egg noodles.  I did put sour cream on my serving and thought it complimented it well.  Just wish my husband and kids would have liked it.  They ate sandwiches.

Very good!  I added some red pepper and lite sour cream to the top of mine and it was awesome!  Without the sour cream it was kind of bland.  I also didn't add any onions, b/c my husband hates them, and I used smart balance margarine instead of butter.

Really surprisingly tasty! I had some leftover cabbage in the fridge, and so I decided to give this recipe a go. I don't like onions, myself, so I omitted them and added a few red pepper flakes to add some  zest. Fabulous! And Really easy to make, too. Thanks so much!

This was very easy and convenient.  I did not have any butter, so I used peanut oil.  I also added garlic and used mini penne pasta.  There is not a whole lot of flavor to this, but the salt and pepper helped.  It is filling and quick to make with ingredients at hand, but nothing to rave about...

Very tasty.  I hesitated, having to use 3 different types of cooking containers, but it sure was worth it.  I will make it again soon. 
I'm Croatian and find Czech recipes close to my nationalities cooking.   Good Job, Kimberly.    Thank you.
