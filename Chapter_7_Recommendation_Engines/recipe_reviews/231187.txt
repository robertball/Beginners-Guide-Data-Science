1.2.17  I had  concerns that 450ºF was too high for this hen, so I cut it back to 425ºF, and the temperature still reached 170ºF (and I used an oven temperature probe) in about 32 minutes.  These birds would have been totally burned up and overcooked at 50 minutes @ 450ºF, and that’s not even allowing for the additional time for the sauce to be brushed on.  Secondly, although the sauce is tasty, this is waaaaaay too much sauce for two cornish hens.  I saved half the sauce, thickened it with a cornstarch slurry, served the sauce at the table with the hens, and I still had more sauce than I needed.  IMO this recipe has a few issues and needs some tweaking.  On the positive side, it’s worth the effort because these little birds were tasty!  My review is based on the modifications I made to the recipe and how the hens turned out with the changes.

The taste was ok and it was moist.   It had a nice brown crispy texture on top until I flipped it at the end and lost that crispiness in the juices so I would not flip it at the end.   Not sure I'd make it again but it was ok.

Terrific recipe. I Gave it 4 stars because as others, I realized that I needed much less sauce than the recipe called for. So I only made half of the amount   And I still had left over sauce.  I will use it for another recipe. It was actually a good thing in the end! The 45O degree oven was just right, as you are opening the oven to baste the hens. My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice feeling! Thanks for the great recipe.
