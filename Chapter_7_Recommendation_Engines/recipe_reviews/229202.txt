Hi.  This is my recipe and I want to share a few tips I have learned making this recipe.  When I made this in the spring and the blueberries were very sweet, 2 cups of sugar was just right for my family.  When I made a batch later in the summer when the blueberries were a little tart, I found mixing tart cooking apples (Gala, Granny Smith) and some sweet apples (Honeycrisp and Fuji) to help make it naturally sweet. My advice is start with 2 cups sugar and add small amounts (1/4 cup) at a time to reach the sweetness you and your family will enjoy.  I would also like to thank the Allrecipes.com kitchen staff for adding the directions on canning to my recipe.

It's a good recipe. The only problem I had was when I put the apples in the slow cooker like the recipe asked for. The apples weren't breaking down. I put the sugar in with the apples. Then the apples broke down like they were suppose to. Came out great.

I really enjoyed this.  So easy to make and really tasty.  I think next time I'll cut down on the allspice and clove a little bit, just to suit my tastes.  But this one's definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe!  It took longer than 11 hr. and 15 min. in my slow cooker to cook it down thick enough.  I also processed it in half pint jars and gave it out to family and friends who have raved about it.  I will make this again - in the pint jars. I think the spices are the secret to the unique taste. I added a little more allspice and clove for the flavor.

The spice and flavor note is amazing BUT...

First, I had to use frozen blueberries, I live in the south on average I can buy 8oz of blueberries for about $4 so for cost effectiveness, it had to be frozen, it was literally the difference between paying $8 and $32 just for the blueberries.

At the end of 8 hours the butter was still very very wet. I cooked it on high uncovered another 4 hours to reduce it, low for another 2 hours and it finally got to butter consistency.

Thank you to the person who posted this recipe!  It is delicious and super easy!  I'm so glad I found a way to use a lot of blueberries at once.  I will be making this every year!  Try it on ham.  Yummy!

I made this according to the directions without modifying except the cloves, I didn't have any and it was a huge hit anyway. I also used frozen instead of fresh blueberries becasue we picked so much and wasn't making this until a few day later so I had to freeze them. Gave them out as Christmas gifts. I gave the last jar to my friend (I have apple butter as well) since she wanted to try it......My husband begged me to make more since he was apparently saving that last jar for a rainy day! LOL
