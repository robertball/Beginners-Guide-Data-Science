I really liked this but nobody else would touch it. (that's okay more for me!) I prepared the pasta according to the Enhanced Spaghetti recipe (also on this site). I used half the amount of oil twice the amount of sauce (it would have REALLY gotten too dry otherwise) and threw in a nice pinch or two of red pepper flakes. I will keep this recipe on hand to prepare for myself... always happy to find a new way of enjoying my spaghetti. Thanks Mike.

A huge hit at our house. Very easy to prepare. I also loved it "straight"--I just skipped the baking part.

Easy and cheap to make good for leftovers. My daughter took it to school the next day for lunch cold. We did add frozen meatballs and substituted oregano for the cinnamon (it came time to put the cinnamon in and I just couldn't do it). Easy sauce: tomato paste tomato sauce and oil! I have a feeling we'll use this base recipe a lot and vary the spices. Thanks!

I have to admit I was afraid to try this recipe. But I love cinnamon and so I had to try it. The flavor is fantastic but I don't know that it needed quite so much oil.

I am not a fan of this one. I thought I would try it out b/c I was a little low on groceries and it sounded different. Really the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because my daughter (who is 5) liked it. I need a little more flavour... and pasta with cinnamon is just like I thought not really a good mix.

What an outstanding combination of flavors! I did add a cup of brown sugar and cut back on the oil a tad. I love the slightly crispy texture that baking gives it.

Sorry I did not care for this at all. I couldn't taste the cinnamon that much so that wasn't the problem. It just tasted like tomato paste.

It was okay. I think I just really don't like baked spaghetti... it kinda made my stomach sour.:( However it smelled good while it was baking...

LOVED this recipe!! My 4 and 3 year olds gobbled it up! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used wheat pasta. I added a little bit of garlic powder too. It was wonderful!!

I made this recipe for my family last night and unfortunately no one (including me) liked it. It was a bit bland and the cinnamon was almost impossible to taste. If I ever made this recipe again I would definitely add something.

This was great! The cinnamon was really a unique taste. I would have enjoyed it more though if it had some added vegetables like maybe mushroom or green pepper just to add a little more to it.

I really liked this (I have only myself to cook for). I did cheat a little since I had some leftover spaghetti with tomato-based sauce already on it. I just sprinkled cinnamon on top mixed it up drizzled on a bit of olive oil and baked for about 45 minutes. Not quite a crispy-looking as the picture but a great taste! Should've gone the full hour. Will be a go-to for leftovers in the future.

This was easy peasy which I Really appreciate! I had some hot Italian sausage in the freezer I cooked it up with a large can of tomato soup and tomato strips. A couple shakes of seasoned garlic/parm powder and dinner was nearly ready. I didn't drain the sausage so I left out the oil and used bow tie pasta just for the fun of it:) My kids were happy when they got home from work since this Sketti means LUNCH Tomorrow!Thank you Mike DELICIOUS!!

This is very similar to a recipe that has been passed done to me. Try including ground meat of your choice bay leaf garlic and onions. Don't be scared of the cinnamon! Its delish! Also I think we add a can of diced tomatoes.
