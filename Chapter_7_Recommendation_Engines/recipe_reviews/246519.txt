This gets 10 stars! I tried the store-bought version of Sriracha salt and loved it, but ran out. I figured I could make my own to make do, since I can't buy any in my area. It doesn't matter. It's a hundred times better when you make your own. I would like to leave a tip: when spreading it out on the baking sheet, really spread it out. I made a patty-like sheet and the edges almost burned and the middle was still slightly, ever-so-slightly, gooey. So, the three hours is perfect but you might get a better result if you don't clump it all together. I'm hooked on this stuff. Next, I'm trying the hotter garlic sauce from Huy Fong Foods. Thanks a million WFDM!

So easy & the sriracha gives just the right amount of flavor. Really good on anything. If you're a watermelon salter, like me, try it.
