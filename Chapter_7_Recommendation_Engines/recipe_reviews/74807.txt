This is a great recipe - easy and tasty. Only change I made was to add 3/4 pound peeled/deveined cooked shrimp when the mushrooms were almost done.  My picky husband gobbled it down and came back for more. I'll be making it again soon.  Thanks

Perfect. As is so often the case, simple dishes like this are the best! I used a specialty pasta rather than penne, but made no changes or substitutions, just eyeballed ingredients to taste. Freshly grated Parmesan is a must, as it provides a ton of flavor. Growing up in an Italian family, I can say this is a very traditional way to serve pasta, and lends itself well to including any variety of vegetables.

I made this over the weekend, and served it with the "Italian Breaded Pork Chops" recipe from this site.  My family loved it!  I used baby bellas (as suggested by another reviewer), and added some chopped fresh basil and spinach as well.  In addition, I added a little evaporated skim milk to make a bit of a creamy sauce (without having to feel too guilty about the calories).  Very good - will make again!

We really liked this.  I doubled the recipe for company and added more garlic than called for (LOVE it).  I also cut up boneless chicken breasts and cooked them in olive oil to add to the pasta.  I also used grated and lots of shredded parmesan cheese to top it off.

Sooo good! I had made a pizza earlier in the week, so I used sliced portobello mushrooms instead of button mushrooms. Because they were portobellos, I probably only used about 6 oz. of mushrooms. It was still delicious! As per other reviewers' suggestions, I doubled the garlic to 2 cloves and added about 1/4 cup fat-free milk to the butter, oil, mushroom, and garlic skillet to add some creaminess to the sauce. I served this with swedishmilk's "Oven-Roasted Asparagus" recipe. The meal was a huge hit!

I loved this dish. I thought it would be bland but it was great. I added two cloves of garlic and salt and peppered to taste and added some garlic powder at the end to taste. Great recipe, thank you!

I made this last night for dinner and my husband and kids loved it, even the picky five year old.  The only thing I changed was the type of pasta-  I used cheese tortellini instead of the penne pasta, and it was still great!  Very easy and tasty!

Thanks for the great recipe.  Did everything but add the canned tomatoes and whipping cream.  I used the easy alfredo sauce recipe from this site and combined the sauteed veggies. YUM!

So simple yet really good! I omitted the oil and just sauteed the mushrooms in butter and added a splash of milk to make a sauce. This is really great as is or you can add a variety of veggies to suit your taste. I used the parmesan cheese in the shaker can, but I know it would taste way better with fresh parmesan. There are so many things you can do with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Love it.  I didn't use as much olive oil and used smart balance instead of butter.  I sauteed my mushrooms alone for about 15-20 on high heat until they carmelized and then I turned the heat down and added lots of extra garlic.  I added some peas (right before the garlic) to add some veggies.

I liked this, but needs MUCH MORE FLAVOR. Bland. Eatable, likable, but needs something to kick it up. Perhaps chicken?

I really liked this recipe! It was easy and quick to make. I did make a few changes - I used baby bella mushrooms, very yummy, doubled the garlic and added some asparagus tips and cooked shrimp to make this a one dish meal. Next time I will probably lower the amount of olive oil a bit, that seemed to be a bit too much and add even more garlic. My son thought it was bland but I thought it was light and flavorful.

The ingredients worked well for me.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used gluten free penne (it was what I had) and button baby bella mushrooms.  I added peiled/deveined shrimp as suggested by another member.  I also added diced onion because I love 'em!  I added 1/2 cup of fat free milk and kicked up the creamy with 2-3 tblspn of mascarpone cheese.  I have never scarfed something down so fast!  It was delicioso!!

Delicious! I will be making this often. I used 2 garlic cloves and glad I did. I don't think one would have been enough for my taste. The sauce doesn't look like much when you're cooking it but WOW! Then adding the cheese and parsley combines even more fantastic flavors! I used dried parsley but hopefully have some fresh next time around. Thank you so much for this delicious and very simple dish!

Delicious!  I added some Chardonnay to the mushrooms while sauteing and let it reduce before pouring over the penne.  I've made this three times already.

Add beef or shrimp and this side dish becomes a main meal.  Once the mushrooms were tender (I used portabella), I added cooked shrimp and heated a few minutes before adding the pasta.  An even heartier meal is cooking strips of beef with the mushrooms.  Both ways were delicious.  I've made this many times for it's become a family favorite.

Instead of 1lb button mushrooms I substituted half for a gourmet blend (baby bella, shiitake and oyster sliced mushrooms) and half button mushrooms.  I think it added to the flavor.

Loooooove this recipe.  It is quick, fast and good.  I added a little bit of salt to the water when I boiled the pasta and I also added red pepper flakes to it.  It was excellent.

I would definitely make this again. I followed the same recipe, but I did make a few changes. I added in some shrimp and tomatoes with the mushrooms, but I used baby bellas instead since they were on sale. Once that was done, I threw in some heavy whipping cream and fresh grated parm cheese. Bring that to a quick boil then let it simmer until it gets a little thick. Add some Cajun seasoning to taste and pour it over the pasta. I thought it was great and the kids really loved it. Getting them to try new things is a nightmare, but this was a success.

I cooked some chicken in small pieces separately and added it to this recipe when I tossed the penne. I also used more garlic I think. I use the minced garlic that comes in the jar and added a heaping tablespoon. Very easy recipe and very tasty.

I followed this recipe but I also added some chopped Kale in with the simmering mushrooms and garlic.  I cut back on the Olive oil too.  I decided to make the sauce a little creamy (well there really WAS no sauce) so I added alittle pasta water and milk after adding the butter to the mushroom mixture.  It was very good.  You can really do what you like with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

Yum, made this as a quick weeknight dinner. So simple and good! I didn't think it was bland- this recipe really allowed the mushrooms to stand out, so if you love mushrooms (I do!) this recipe is great.

I used the oil from a jar of sun-dried tomatoes to give the mushrooms extra flavor while sauteing.  This was a wonderful meal!

I think this recipe was actually the first time I made something in less than the amount of time it was supposed to take! Yes! It was tasty though next time, I would add some chopped onion in with the mushrooms. Then maybe it will approach 5-star status.

I found it to be a little wanting - but my husband seemed to really like it.  I thnk we both just really prefer a more substantial sauce so that there is more "flavor" for the noodles.  Do try this though - if you aren't huge on sauce I think you will LOVE this.

Great Recipe! I will definitely make it again. Will be great to add a few veggies or some meat if I want to, but it doesn't NEED it. I made a few minor alterations - I added the butter about a minute into cooking the mushrooms and I also added a few splashes of dry vermouth towards the end of cooking the mushrooms. (thats the way my mom has always made mushrooms, so it is sort of a habit in our house to make them that way). Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  It gets high 5's for ease of preparation and excellent taste.  We love mushrooms here, so we pretty much knew this would be a winner.  Although simple to make, once plated, it looked 'gourmet'.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe; we'll be making this regularly!

I made this for dinner last night and - YUMMY!!! I used baby bellas instead of white button mushrooms for more flavor; cut back on the oil; skipped the parsley (just forgot it). I did add a handful of frozen chopped spinach just before the shrooms finished cooking, and rainbow spiral pasta instead of penne. One of my kitties was dying to lick the bowl! Next time I'll add the parsley and more cheez - and make extra for kitty . . .

Made a few enhancements. Added grilled asparagus, red pepper flakes, and added very little heavy cream to the penne. Topped with a little shredded Parmesan. Next time, going to make it with a little pancetta. This was a fabulous meal!

New family favorite!  Everyone loves it.  I've usually only had canned mushrooms on hand and they work very well too.  I'm thinking it'd be fine if we omit the butter.  I've made a double batch to make sure there's enough (good thing) but the leftovers aren't as good. Highly recommended!

This lacked the flavor and sauciness I needed so I threw in a can of cream of mushroom soup with some whole milk and garlic salt to give it a little more flavor.

I love the mushrooms.  I did use baby portabellas and 2 big cloves of garlic, this added more flavor.  I also used some of the pasta water and a little milk to add to the sauce to make it creamier.

This was an easy recipe, except that my husband freaked when he saw the amount of liquid after the mushrooms had been sauteed. So, he drained a lot of the liquid out, and then finished up with the butter and added it to the pasta. I took it to my family dinner, and it was eaten right up! Next time, I'll be more adventurous and add other things, like some of the other pictures suggest. ;)

This recipe was easy to make.  I followed it exactly though I did use Barilla Whole Grain pasta.  The end result was good I thought but not excellent-- sort of bland.  Maybe some wine?

This recipe is so easy and sooooo good.  I did add more garlic and parmesan cheese.  I also used dried parsley instead of fresh, and I didn't use the butter (simply because I forgot).  It was awesome.  My son (who is not a big mushroom person) asked for more, so needless to say, I'll be doubling the recipe next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley. Didn't notice a difference. Also used mozarella instead of parmesan (also lacking..) and it turned out great. To satify our spicy buds, I added few teaspoons of cayenne and 1 tbsp of crushed red peppers. I may cut down on the olive oil next time to be healthier..great recipe!!! thanks

Yum! We really liked it. Well, my husband and I did. The 10 year old thought it was so-so, the six year old did not like it, and the baby ate a few of the noodles. The only substitution was dried parsley, we didn't have any fresh on hand. So in my opinion it is more of an "adult" dinner.

Quick and easy with lots of room for variations...I added some steamed broccoli and crushed red pepper for an extra little kick. My hubby is a trained chef and really enjoyed this dish.

Easy, quick, and yummy!  

I added a little extra garlic and garnished with fresh basil instead of parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I couldn't believe how yummy it was for something so easy!  Even my 19 month old devoured it.

But I should point out that it contains 1/4 cup of oil and 1 T. of butter and 1/4 cup of cheese.  Almost anything is going to taste good with that much fat mixed in!  :)  So although it's vegetarian, it's not health food.

I crushed the garlic and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil.  It was OK, a little on the bland side.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe instructed--no additions or changes as other reviewers made--and I thought it was just okay.  Sorry.

This is a simple but delicious dish. I doubled the amount of pasta and added a little extra cheese.
