This recipe is awesome!  It tastes just like Korea!  We had it with fried dumplings and extra kim chee on the side.  I didn't have Korean chile powder so I used plain, was not quite as spicy as Korean but the dish was excellent - my husband loved it!

Good! I did not have Kimchi on hand, so I took a risk and used sauerkraut seasoned with cayenne pepper and mexican chili powder. Tasted awesome! Not a signature-Korean flavor, but still very good. I also added a boiled egg and a dash of sesame oil to add another dimension of more korean-style flavor.

Being that "heat" is a personal taste, I was surprised that I didn't find this as hot as I expected.  My husband, who usually adds hot sauce to EVERYTHING, thought it was great the way it was.  My 7 yr old boys even ate it!  As usual, I didn't have all of the specific ingredients on hand, so I used the basics of this recipe and used the veggies and meat we did have.  We'll make this again.

A delicious, quick and easy dish. Great to satisy a craving of something spicy & flavorful. You can do without the cucumbers if you aren't into cooked cucumbers. Also, I recommend cutting the kimchi up into smaller pieces. I also added sliced serrano peppers when adding the kimchi. You do not have to use a full cup of kimchi. Best to use korean red pepper flakes (different flavor & texture) available at any asian market in large bags (will last a long time). The vinegar cooks off, so if you are worrying about that, don't. Lastly, I would add more than 1 tbsp of water towards the end to keep it moist. I ended up putting about 3-4 tbsp of water. Serve immediately over hot, fresh rice!

I grated my (frozen) ginger, not fond of bites of ginger.  Added the carrots in with the onion  and then garlic just for a minute before adding liquids. Also held back the cucumber, adding it in  at the end just to get it hot. Didn't have canned tuna so used  Ahi.

I just cooked this today the only thing I did different was add a tablespoon of sugar because i added a little too much vinegar and it came out really well.

It tasted okay.  My husband thought it should be made with a different meat.  He says it would be better with fresh tuna, pork or chicken.   I agree.

I love Kimchee and my BF  kinda hates it.  I thought this recipe would be a good bridge to showcase all the things I love, but tame the funk he doesn't like.  We did both liked it and the only change it made was to use red bell pepper instead of cucumber (which he hates more than kimchee) and extra hot pepper flakes instead of korean chili powder.  Thanks for such an easy introduction into korean cooking!

I tried to stick to the recipe as much as I could but used sesame oil instaed of olive oil (more Asian), replaced the missing cukes by zucchini chunks and used Korean chili paste I had (not flakes). The result was very good but still missing something to be really great, so I served the rice with mini onion green-omeletts and it helped. All in all an interesting recipe, mainly because I didn't know before that tuna was used in Korean cooking :-) Shall keep trying some additions though till it will be perfect for my taste...
