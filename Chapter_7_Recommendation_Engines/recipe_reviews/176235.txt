We thought this was really yum Dan! I used lite soy sauce and because I didn't have black vinegar, I used rice vinegar instead. This is a keeper and thank you so much!

This is one of the yummiest Chinese dish I have had from here!! Thank you so much for a great tasting recipe. I doubled the recipe and used Szechuan peppercorns instead because we enjoy them more than regular peppercorns in Chinese food. This is definitely a keeper!

This came together really fast which is nice.  We like spicy and I thought this would be spicer than it was.  I served this Jasmine rice and some stir fried veggies.

RE: Chrismith
This recipe was edited before they put it on the site. They missed out preparing the the peppercorns. Try toasting them in a dry pan for a minute or so. They'll start to pop around in the pan. Then grind them in a pestle and mortar. It really brings out the flavour of the peppercorns.

'Omitted the peppercorns & the hot bean sauce.  This reminded me of good mall food.  I do mean that as a compliment.  It's good, but it tastes easy - which it is.  I used 1/2t crushed red pepper & it was mild heat, maybe too much for those that are sensitive.  'Glad I tried.

This is delicious. I would recommend leaving out the peppercorns though as they are too strong when you bite down on them. When making it a second time I replaced it with about a third of a teaspoon ground black pepper. I also left out the salt as soy sauce is salty enough. This was quick and easy, I will definitely make again!

This is excellent, spicy but with a heat that doesn't linger. Do toast the peppercorns and grind them, it makes a world of difference. Quadrupled the recipe, stir fried some fresh green beans in sesame oil and served over jasmine rice to 4 teenage boys. Had no leftovers and requests from other moms for the recipe!

I made it and it was delicious!! However, the recipe did not did not leave any extra sauce. I used the ingredients from the marinade and added a little corn starch. It thickened the sauce and gave me enough to spoon over the rice. My husband thought it was awesome!

Loved it!  Very easy to make.  

I used Dan's suggestion to prepare the peppercorns first by heating them in a skillet and then crushing them.  

It sounded like the dish would be too spicy with the full tablespoon of crushed red peppers so I used just 3/4 teaspoon.  Everybody liked it but I did get comments that it was spicy so I'm glad I didn't use the full amount.  

It made a great dinner with brown rice and steamed vegetables and I know I will definitely make this again!

Holy this was good. I didn't have Chinese red peppers so I used the regular western ones from mccormick and  this was good. I put less flakes for those in my house who don't like spice so much, but then I added a ton of chili oil to my plate because I do love spice. I put half the vinegar since I put less flakes, I used mirin instead of sherry, and I used black garlic bean sauce since I was out of the spicy bean sauce. I'll be doing this again with the spicy one instead and this is definitely a style I'm going to be using over and over.

This was very good-plus quick and easy.  I used 1 t. fish oil instead of hot bean paste because my husband doesn't like hot...other than that followed recipe.  I would cut the oil down at least a teaspoon next time.

Really easy and tasty recipe. I used Brandy instead of dry Sherry but I think a Sherry would be better. I also added cayenne and hoisin because I didn't have hot bean sauce. At the end I added cashews and they complimented it really well--takes it to the next level TBH! Served over white rice. I could see making even more sauce next time.
I was worried about the pepper corns but they're actually really fun in this dish. Don't be afraid!

Loved this recipe. I've made it with both chicken breasts and thighs, and I prefer the flavor with breasts.

Delicious! Fed two teenage boys, my husband and myself. Very easy and very good! Be sure to cook chicken until all liquid evaporates to get the caramelization  and colour. Didn't have the bean sauce and omitted the 1/2 tsp of salt as I figured the soy sauce etc. was salty enough. Sprinkled toasted black sesame seeds and extra chopped green onion for finishing the dish and served it with some brown rice and sauteed broccoli. I also added an order of soup from a local Asian restaurant.

Made this tonight & didn't have all ingredients. Normally I like to go with exactly as written 1st time but needed to use up boneless, skinless chicken thighs & this family is discount & dollar store style. Didn't have peppercorns, used table pepper, omitted salt, sherry, rice vinegar & sesame oil, subbed apple cider vinegar & yellow onion, added 2 TBS Brown Sugar, extra honey, red pepper flakes & a bit of pineapple juice & pineapple, Asian chili sauce & teriyaki. I think this would be 5 stars with ingredients as listed coz I definitely would've given 4.5 stars. Fairly easy to make, for my 1st time I got all ingredients together ahead of time for ease of cooking. I had to make 2 batches coz I had 12 thighs. Served with leftover mashed potato cakes from this site using bacon & onion & cheese in the mix & when done, added a dollop of sour cream. Put everything on baking sheet & stuck in 350 oven while I thickened sauce left in pan with flour/water mix & used that as sauce over all meat. An Asian chef friend of mine told me the key to a good sticky sauce is adding a bit of honey over the meat before adding the sauce & I feel the added time in oven solidified the stickiness/goodness. DELICIOUS. Thank you for the recipe & I find that it can be modified easily using on hand ingredients. The best thing besides flavor/taste, there were no leftovers & I'd used leftover food from 2 days ago to make the whole meal. Cost & time effective!

I took a taste before adding the bean sauce mix. I preferred it much better than the finished chicken. Ill try it again with some variation on cooking technique.

I baked some chicken thighs yesterday, coated in egg/flour poultry seasoning. I decided to cut them up, and do his recipe. It was delicious! I will definitely do tis a lot. Really great! I was afraid it might be TOO spicy, but it was wonderful. Kudos!
