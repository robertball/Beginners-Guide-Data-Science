A suggestion for those cooks having trouble rolling and cutting the dough:
Try putting the dough in a floured pastery bag (or a Ziplock with a corner cut out will do) and squeezing it out like toothpaste. Then slice off bits with a sharp knife to make appropriate-sized dumplings. You can squeeze them right into the pot of boiling water!

I gave this recipe 3-stars before, because my attempt came out very soggy and not very appetising.  However, I have since played with the recipe a bit, getting a better idea of "soft  dough" (it should stick to your hands, but stick to itself more...if that makes sense) and now I LOVE this recipe.  Worth the effort - filling, tasty, and great with blue cheese or alfredo sauce.

IMPORTANT TIP: baking the potatoes took about 50 minutes - not 30.  Also, it took forever to cut up the pasta (probably because I didn't do big dough balls).  I would plan about 2-3 hours for this recipe.  PREP TIPS: I added brown sugar and cinnamon to enhance the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  Also, regarding the flour thing, I think the key is to follow the recipe when adding flour to the dough.  Then, when you are actually rolling out the pasta, make sure the surface on which you are working and your hands are well floured.  This will keep it from being too sticky and ending up looking like dumplings.  Also, the person who said the smaller the better was VERY right.  If you make the pieces of pasta large, you will end up with extremely filling dough balls.  If you want it to be like pasta, and not dumplings, you need to keep it small.  I went with flat, squares & rectangles about 1" x 1" to 1" x 2" (still very filling).  Also, I used the tofu cream sauce recipe on this site, using vanilla soy milk instead of plain (to add sweetness and match the pasta) and it was awesome!!  Even my husband, who is not a vegetarian, loved it. :)

I made a half recipe to use up leftover sweet potatoes, and thought they turned out great! I made them quite small (about the size of the end of my thumb). Anyone complaining about the lack of flavour... um... have you ever had potato gnocchi? These are how they're supposed to be.

Hint: cook the sweet potato in the microwave. Just wash the outside, stab it a few times with a knife, and nuke until soft (expect 15-30 min). Then cut in half and scoop out flesh.

I never made gnocchi before, and I'm not a "practiced cook".  This came out spectacular.  Like someone else said- its got to stick to itself more than your hands.  I added flour to this until it was "rollable".  I tossed it with a little virgin olive oil and salt and it was great.

I think next time I'll try adding some additional flavoring to it, maybe cinnamon, brown sugar, etc.  I think anything you'd add to a sweet potato recipe would work well with this recipe.  Thanks so much for providing it!!

These were delicious.  I have been making traditional potato gnocchi for years (from an old family recipe) and decided to try sweet potato - WOW!  I topped them with a little bit of butter infused with fresh sage.  Can't wait to make them again.  Thanks!

I boiled the potatoes instead of baking them (wasn't paying attention), but I don't think it mattered. It was quick though.  Also, I used a spaetzle maker and made the dough the consistency of spaetzle.  I think this worked, except that I put too much into the water at a time and possibly overcooked it, making the noodles a bit mushy.  As far as taste goes, I had to add more salt (and I'm not a salt-aholic) and some pepper.  We ate the noodles in alfredo sauce with chicken and peas as a mash-up and it was good (and colorful).  This recipe has real promise.  I'm going to try it again and be more careful with the boiling to see if the texture improves.

I really liked these, but thought it definitely needed a sauce.  If anyone makes these and finds a good sauce, please post it because I would like to make them again!  I used less flour than what the recipe called for.

This gnocchi is worth the work, but it is REALLY important to use a ricer or SLIGHTLY MASH with two fork very gently and spread it out in a thin layer to cool to room temperature. You have to be super gentle while mixing in the flour as well. The technique (and it really IS a technique) can be seen in videos online and is important to follow so as to get light, soft gnocchi instead of dense little blobs. Another important point - don't add too much flour (again, it will become dense) and let the "dough" rest for 5 minutes before rolling/shaping. I strongly urge anyone to check out some videos first to make your gnocchi experience a pleasurable one!

These tasted good- very subtle sweetness from the sweet potatoes & such a nice subtle garlic flavor (I added in 2 med/large cloves instead of only 1). Then since I can't eat alfredo sauce due to high cholesterol, I tossed the gnocchi in olive oil & roasted garlic slices & then added in a few dashes of a garlic chilli spice mix. Delicious, though I'm sure w/ alfredo sauce it would have been out of this world. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the dough was very sticky, but I feared adding in more flour b/c a reviewer mentioned his/hers coming out hard. Maybe I added in too much flour b/c I remember restaurant gnocchi as being much mushier, not ressembling cooked pasta. When rolling out, this isn't supposed to feel like a regular pasta dough , it shouldn't be dry & maybe it is supposed to be very sticky so they come out mushy like in the restaurants. I rolled my dough "logs" on a floured surface, so the inside was still sticky, but the outside was fine. They expand in the water so make them small. I think the smaller the better. The other reason I give this recipe 4 & not 5 stars is b/c it didn't come out as asthetically pleasing as I had hoped (though I'll still risk it & post a photo). Still want to try this again after I've done my HW on how to handle gnocchi dough. The ingredients are great, but it's the amounts of flour I'm not sure about.

I found some tricks that makes handling the dough much easier. I put the dough in a zip lock bag and placed it in the fridge over night so that it would be a bit firmer.  I then cut a small hole in the corner of the bag and just squeezed out a tube of dough onto my floured surface. I would also add a bit more salt then the recipe suggests.

the idea is good but an easier way to make potato gnocchi (sweet potato or regular) is just to peel and grate the potatos while they are raw then just mix with flour until a dough forms.  You can still put one egg in the mix if that helps you to work with the dough, but I don't really think it is necessary.  I also put the gnocchi in the freezer for an hour or so before boiling just to keep it together well.

for those of you who complain of these being more like dumplings than pasta....IT IS DUMPLINGS.   Gnocchi fall into the dumpling category and are not pasta just because they are italian in nature.    pay attention to the recipe and be mindful in adding the flour, bit by bit.   it should resemble a cookie dough.   you can shape the gnocchi after you've cut them, for instnce by rolling them gently under the tines of a fork.   you can season them to taste, and sweet potatoes are delicious with flavors other than the generic pie spices.   great additions are parmesan cheese, curry, garlic, sage and other herbs.  just dont overwork the dough, be gentle with it.     try simple sauces like butter and sage, or a light basil or arugula pesto

This recipe was SO OH good! I did make a few changes as per my own taste. First, I used whole wheat flour. Second, I ommitted the nutmeg, as I didn't have any. Lastly, I steamed some baby spinach, cut it up and added that to the dough. I put the dough through a ziplock bag with a corner cut off and squeezed it into the pot, cutting every inch or so. Also, I microwaved the sweet potato per another reviewer's suggestion. It cut the cook time down to about 8 mins per sweet potato. 
This recipe is great and easy to customize. Wonderful recipe!

I was *really* nervous about this recipe b/c reviews were mixed and I know how tricky gnocchi can be in general.  I'd made it twice before with just okay results.  
This turned out FANTASTIC!  The sweet potato flavor is super subtle.  I did not change the ingredients at all, despite others descriptions and I was glad for that.  The biggest thing to do right is the amount of flour.  I worked about 1 3/4c. into the dough and then used the remaining 1/4 to flour my work surface and sprinkle on any "wet" spots as I rolled this out.  The trick is to use as little flour as possible while still being workable.  Those who added 3 c. of flour instead of two to keep from having sticky dough had lumps of glue for a reason!
My husband said he thinks this was the best gnocchi he's ever eaten, restaurant or otherwise.  He loved it and was sad that I only boiled half the batch for the two of us.  I served it with a made up alfredo sauce with a hint of vodka.  Yummo.  Wish there were leftovers except that gnocchi doesn't keep well.

I made them pretty much as listed. Since a number of posters commented they were a tad lacking in flavor I just added 1/4 tsp each of fresh ginger and cinnamon. Hubbby (who is not a sweet potato fan) and daughter (who likes her gnocci the "normal and plain" way) were not at all sure about this.....but both ended up liking it/would ask that I make it again. Gnocci is tricky...the important thing is consistency. I used the 2c of flour as mentioned which was just right. I was careful to add slowly/stir it in evenly and even went to the extra effort of using a flour sifter on the flour to avoid making it lumpy at all costs. I hand rolled them....no need for them to be sooo sticky you need to squirt them out of a bag like frosting.......but you do stop adding flour just at the point the dough is rollable and it will not be a "dry dough" or they will turn out tough. Gnocci is kinda like bread...you have to do it a few times to get the "feel" of what is just the right amount of flour for the right texure. Good gnocci is wonderful/bad gnocci is tough and hideous. Most restauraurant gnocci is sadly the latter.

I am a complete novice when it comes to making any kind of pasta from scratch, but this turned out great! I'm an AR photo addict but I won't be submitting a photo this time as mine didn't look very pretty! Tasted good though. I had a tough time getting the hang of forming the little gnocchi 'pillows', but I eventually got it. I used probably 1 1/2 cups of flour. They seemed quite chewy to me right after cooking, but surprisingly, they were MUCH softer & more enjoyable when I reheated leftovers. I'll definitely try making these again sometime.

Yay for the dinner-saving gnocchi!  I made this after discovering I had gotten sweet potatoes instead of russet... so chili baked potatoes weren't going to work anymore and I needed a new recipe fast.  I had everything I needed to make this recipe, and it was really easy.  We had it with alfredo sauce, but next time I may go with a less garlicky sauce, or possibly butter and parm.  
I thought it was easy enough to roll out like a play-doh snake and cut into pieces.  Just keep flouring everything like when you make sugar cookies (your hands, the dough, the cutting board) and it'll work fine.
My family loved it!  I cooked about 1/3 of the batch right away, and froze the rest as dough (already cut into pieces) for later.  Yay for amazingly delicious gnocchi!!

These gnocchi are great! 

I saw that some reviewers commented that they were looking for a good sauce. This balsamic reduction is AMAZING! You will not regret trying it!

I used the bag method. It worked great, but i had to add a lot of extra flour. I served it with a cream sauce but i think that butter and cinnamon would have been better.

My mother used to make these when I was a kid. After cutting them into sections she used to roll them with the back tines of a fork  for a better look and more uniform cooking.  I served them as a side  with a simple lemon pepper butter  drizzle and they were great.  A good recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.

I really enjoyed this recipe...my boyfriend was less keen but it could just be partially due to his distain for "white sauce."    I didn't find it hard to make for someone who has only minimal experience making fresh pasta.  I took some reviewers' advice and added the last 3/4 cup of flour gradually while I was rolling it out and made sure my hands and surface were well-floured.  I did find them a bit bland when I first cooked them but WOW they tasted fabulous when I reheated them the next day.

As a home chef, there's nothing worse than spending money and a good chuck of your time, to have a recipe turnout like this.  This recipe as written, has absolutely no taste.  I even grated fresh nutmeg and used fresh sage and still nothing. Oh well.

Exactly what I was looking for. Wonderful texture and very subtle flavor. I used whole wheat flour. Served with Rosemary Pasta Roasted Garlic Sauce from this site.

I cut this in half and had so many I think it could serve 3-4! Delicious. Popped them directly into saute pan from boiling water, got some texture with butter (sub - Brummel), pine nuts and sage. So fast, would make a great on the spot appetizer for guests, too.

Ohhh boy.  These are alot of work, but they are extremely tasty, especially with a little butter and salt.  This recipe is very time consuming, and for me at least - took longer than the prep time listed here - about an hour to get the dough ready, and then roll and cut all the bits of dough.  With that being said, they are worth all the hard work and elbow grease.  (I upped the garlic to 3 cloves , because I love garlic)  They were VERY VERY yummy.

Very, very good. I used pumpkin instead of sweet potato because my 9 month old has a sweet potato intolerance. His stomach just won't keep them down. I can only imagine what it is like with sweet potato. I used a decorators tip and disposable pastry bag, which made clean up very easy and the execution of this recipe much neater.  I served this with alfredo sauce and oven baked italian chicken. We will be making this again.

This was a pretty decent recipe.  I think next time I make it I will omit the nutmeg.  I didn't care for that particular taste.  I think I will try the brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon next time.  The recipe was easy to make though.

I followed this recipe to a T and did not care for it.  I am sure it is too much flour.  If I were to attempt this recipe again, I would skip the garlic and reduce the flour by 1/2 a cup (or more).

While it takes time, this was an easy enough recipe to put together.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of flour (including the flour to roll out the dough) and it came out well though it was kind of a messy process.  Next time, I will use the top reviewer's tip of putting the dough in a bag and squeezing it out.  I served this with  Giada DeLaurentis' sage brown butter sauce which you can find on the Food Network website or another version on this site too.

To shorten the prep time for this, I microwave the sweet potatoes in a "potato bag" for 5-10 minutes (instead of the 30-50 minutes you need for baking).  They come out just as soft and pliable as baking but it cuts the time almost in half.

Came out great. I saw someone wanted a recommendation for a good sauce so here you go.   I used a cream sauce that also works great with butternut squash raviolis. 1 jar of Bertolli alfredo sauce, 1 TBSP brown sugar and 1 TSP of maple syrup, dash of salt & pepper. The sauce is sweet , but you can alter the sugar/syrup to your own taste. I also sprinkle with toasted walnuts or pecans for a garnish. Might also be good with just a butter, brown sugar and sage sauce too.

Great recipe! I used the suggestions of previous reviewers and changed a few things.  I used butternut squash instead of potato, and mixed it all together in a ziplock bag.  Once I got a good consistency to the dough, I cut a hole in the corner, and used it like an icing bag to make the shape.  Delish with a little balsamic vinegar

I found this to be ever so bland...followed the recipe exactl except more fresh garlic...made a light cream sauce to spoon over the top.....it was quite time consuming, even making the sweet potatoes in the microwave!  Not our tastes at ALL....sorry...this is the first recipe I have tried and was dissatisfied.

I am still experimenting with recipe, i just tried it last night. So far, I agree with the suggestion to put the dough into a zip plastic bag and cut a small hole in one corner and squeeze it out. I squeezed right into the pot of boiling water as someone suggested. Changes i've made so far, instead of nutmeg, I added curry...inspired by pumpkin curry soup that is delicious. I would like to make a sauce for it that would start by sauteeing cut up pieces of bacon or pancetta until crisp, adding diced onions until transparent, then stirring in flour and finally milk...salt and pepper. Then remove from heat and stir in parmesan cheese and peas...like in a tortellini sauce. I'll try it out and report back!

My daughter and I made these one evening and had a great time!  I microwaved one large yam for 15 minutes and the skin came right off.  I left out the garlic because we wanted a sweeter gnocchi.  They were wonderful!!  They turned out much lighter than the regular potato ones we made before.

I thought I would be clever and use my pasta machine to help make this. I pulled out my 15 year old machine (I'm guessing it's about 15 years old because my oldest child is 13 and who has time to make pasta when you have kids?)and was thrilled to find that it still works! Sadly, it didn't save me any time. It took me over an hour to make this delicious gnocchi.  I don't have a scale so I measured out 2 cups of cooked sweet potato. I put all of the ingredients in the pasta machine and quickly discovered there wasn't nearly enough flour. I only had 1 cup of white flour, so the rest was whole wheat flour. I probably added about 3/4 cup more than the recipe required, and it could have used a bit more.  It was difficult to get the dough to extrude because it was so sticky, but I persevered. Here's the good news:  My family LOVED it! My 13 year old announced that she wouldn't be eating it, but agreed to taste it. That turned into a full portion. My 4-1/2 year old does not like sweet potatoes; he doesn't like much. He didn't even want to try it, though he helped me to make it. I finally prevailed and he tried one, and he proceeded to eat all that I had put on his plate. He said, "Hey, this is good!"  In summary, this is a delicious recipe and if I could order it pre-made, I would eat it all the time. Since it took SO long to make it myself, and I really don't enjoy being in the kitchen, my rate of consumption will be much lower. If I'm lucky, someone else will make it the next time.

I've made gnocci several times in the past and actually found this recipe more user-friendly than others.  I followed it but subbed a little whole wheat flour (maybe 1/4 cup).  Here are my gnocci tips:refrigerate the dough to make it easier to handle; don't let the water be rapidly boiling when you drop your gnocci in (I bring it do a rolling boil and then let it slow down before I put the gnocci in, I think it agitates them too much if it's boiling to hard). Finally, sometimes the gnocci texture is a bit to "raw" seeming for me so I brush them with olive oil and stick them under the broiler on a cookie sheet for a few minutes on each side.  The texture is sumptuous.

Really good - a heck of a lot of work.  I think I used too much sweet potato because I found the dough to be really sticky and hard to work with.  BUT a ncie change of pace from regular pasta and VERY filling.

I had all the hopes that this would be similiar to a fanastic sweet potatoe gnocchi that we had in Italy. Unfortunately it was anything but that....It ended up tasteless and like dough rocks. We were very dissapointed. I would like to give the recipe one more chance, we will cross our fingers!!

Very good basic recipe but, as with everything, tweak to taste.  You will need to adjust flour to amount of sweet potato you use.  You want the mixture to be sticky.  If it sticks to your fingers but you can roll it off, it is done.  I added brown sugar, cinnamon and a dash of maple syrup to mine.  Was great but I may add some ricotta for a bit more creaminess next time.  I took another reviewer's advice and put it in a Ziploc bag with a corner snipped off.  I pushed it through the bag and used kitchen sheers to snip into a boiling pot of salted water.  Delicious!

I was out at a local restaurant that served sweet potato gnocchi, so I figured I would try them.  Wow!  I had never had gnocchi before, but the idea intrigued me.  I then bought some pre-made regular ones at Costco.  I'm glad I didn't start with those!  After the restaurant, I came to this faithful site and found the perfect recipe.  At the restaurant, they had just melted butter and added finely sliced sage.  The combination is heaven...and I'm not a big fan of sage...at all!  I grow it in my garden, because it is well behaved and pretty.  Now, after having it out there for 15 years, I actually will use it.  Just typing this is making me want to make up a batch.  Oh, it freezes beautifully.  I had enough for four separate meals.  It makes enough to make it worth making!

Word of caution with this one, don't use pumpkin as a substitute for the sweet potato.  Unless it's from a can I suppose, but I tried this one with the original recipe and they were awesome.  Then I had a small pie pumpkin that was getting old so I baked it up and tried to use it..... not the same.

Like some other contributors, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and some brown sugar to the sweet potato.  I also baked the potatoes for much longer, close to 50 minutes.  I was nervous that the garlic wouldn't cook fast enough and would taste raw but I chopped it very small and it added a nice bit of flavor.  I still wish they were a bit more flavorful and will try to find something else to add to the dough itself.  I served with some pre-made alfredo sauce from Trader Joe's and cracked fresh pepper on top.  A salad of baby spinach/mandarin orange made a nice accompaniment.

Yum!  My whole family will be enjoying this gnocci all year.  From pulling the already cooked potatoes out of the freezer, to putting the dishes in the dishwasher, I was in the kitchen about 2 hours.  I thought the recipe was perfect, and didn't feel the need to change a thing, though I didn't actually measure how much flour I put in.  Like other reviewers have said, the dough has to be obnoxiously sticky.  I roll mine into logs, keeping the outside coated with lots of flour.  I had enough potatoes to make 4 batches of the recipe, so I froze my well-floured dumplings individually on cookie sheets, then moved them into a baggie.  Now they're ready to boil whenever we get the craving for gnocci.  My favorite preperation is to saute some garlic and sage in butter, then add the boiled gnocci just long enough to get a little crisp on the outside.  Mmmmm!

I made this last night and we thought it was great! Because it was already 9 pm and it was on an impulse I didn't want to have to wait for the potatos to cook so I just sent my husband to the store for canned sweet potatos. They are in a light syrup so I just rinsed them off with cold water and they worked fine.

I made this with pureed butternut squash because I had it left over and finely ground white spring  wheat flour.  I put the dough into a plastic kitchen storage bag, twisting the top to extrude through the cut off corner.  I used a sharp kitchen scissors (love my Joyce Chens) to cut right into the boiling water.  That was easy and mess free. These were very good and light in texture, but will make again with sweet potatoes to compare the flavors.

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought it was a nice change from the usual mashed sweet potatoes. It took about 1 3/4 c flour to get my dough to the right consistency, and with my work surface and hands well-floured, I didn't have any trouble working with it.  I like my sweet potato dishes on the sweet side, so I decided to make a butter/maple/sage sauce to go on top of these (about 1/4 c butter, 2 tbls olive oil, handful of sage, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c REAL maple syrup). Melt butter with olive oil in a pan, add the sage, then immediately add the cinnamon and syrup. Toss with the gnocchi and serve promptly. You can add more syrup if you want more sweetness.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last week to rave reviews.  Hubby isn't a fan of gnocchi but he loved this and was disappointed that there were no leftovers. Served it with a mushroom garlic pasta sauce and a bit of parmesan.  I'll make it again this week for company.  I used white whole wheat flour and only needed 1 1/2 cups.  While not perfect looking, they came out perfectly textured and only needed a couple of minutes to cook in the boiling water.  This is a keeper!

I subbed butternut squash for the sweet potatoes, and just put some butter and romano cheese on it when it was still hot. Delicious, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

really tasty!  I used a large butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes, and ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour to reach the right texture. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and put all of the dough into a large zip-lock bag, cut a corner off and squeezed it out.  I used kitchen shears to snip bite sized pieces into the boiling water (beware the splash back!)and let them boil until they floated to the top.  After they were done cooking, in a separate pan, I heated up some olive oil and butter and sauteed some garlic.  I added italian spices, salt and pepper and tossed it and some parmesan on the top of the hot gnocchi.  It was SO good!!!  My husband loved it, and so did I.  I will make this again for sure!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I cut the recipe in half because I only had one sweet potato and used only one cup of flour. It made enough for a healthy portion/side dish with some pork chops I made. I also made a brown butter sauce with sage and then topped it off with some freshly grated parmesan cheese and it was really, incredibly good! Thanks for this recipe, it was easy to make and turned out wonderfully!

Pretty tasty, but kind of heavy.  We enjoyed these, but you can't eat too many because they're kind of rich. I think the nutmeg sounds like a strange ingredient, but it somehow worked. I had some trouble getting the right consistency to the dough, but I did enjoy watching the cooked gnocci pop up to the top of the water while cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipie is a neat idea, but I found it to be too bland for my liking. Also, it took considerably longer than the instructions said it would because the dough kept sticking to my hands. I used slightly less than 2 cups flour and actually think I should have used more like 1 cup. I may try this again adding brown sugar and cinnamon to the gnocchi to add more flavor. One note to other cooks: make sure you put plenty of flour on your rolling pin AND on top of the dough before rolling it out. Otherwise the dough will stick all over everything.

Based on the reviews, I added a lot more salt, some minced onion and some lemon herb spice, no nutmeg. After gradually mixing in all the flour, it was still too sticky to work with so I kept adding more flour. I think I ended up with about 3 cups in total!  It still was hard to work with, even after I squeezed it out of a bag. Half I boiled as per recipe, the other half I felt guilty about throwing out so I added some oil and baking powder and tried baking like biscotti. Shaped into a log, baked for 35 min @ 300. Cooled for 10, cut into 3/4 inch slices and baked again @ 275 for 10 more minutes. It ended up being sort of like a soft bread stick.

Oh Yum! These are so good!!  I followed the recipe except I used 1 cup white flour, and one cup whole wheat. I followed the suggestion of another cook, and used an icing bag to squeeze out the dough. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is it's a little more time consuming than i thought it would be.

Used butternut squash and half a head of roasted garlic, tossed it with a sage brown butter sauce.  Good, but not great; definitely not worth the time it took.  Perhaps I added too much flour?  The dough was still sticking to my hands and seemed almost too soft to "roll" (managed to squeeze it into tubes), but they were a little gummier than I'd like my gnocchi and the flavor of the squash was so subtle as to be practically unnoticeable.  Perhaps I'll try again with sweet potato.  The roasted garlic flavor was great, so I'll keep that.

This recipe didn't turn out right. I followed the directions to a tee. It took quite some time to prep and make, and in the end, was a disappointment. I used a butter garlic sauce w a dash of cinnamon. The dough was way too sticky. I read everyone's comments beforehand and was quite sure the recipe would be delicious. Most likely will not try again.

They are 'okay' I found them very bland. I don't see myself making these again.

These were a little too sweet for my taste and a little gummy too.  The texture might have been my fault, but the flavor was just not there.

This was delicious and just fun to make. Tossed it with a nice sage-butter sauce and fresh Parmesan. Goes great with roast chicken.

This recipe was Super Easy!  I used leftover sweet potato and it made the recipe a piece of cake.  I can't wait to try them with a sage butter sauce.  I'm wondering if they'll taste too garlicy.

These were delicious and made for a filling dinner with a restaurant-y feel! I used a lot less flour than the recipe called for (a little over 1 cup), which is why I can't give the full 5 stars. This is a recipe worth trying!

The gnocchi turned out great!!  I followed the recipe as written and my husband and I enjoyed it very much. The sauce I made was an improvised brown butter with sage with crumbled up bacon.  Once the butter is brown and sage is fried, I tossed in the gnocchi and cooked bacon and cooked until it was warmed through.

Absolutely delicious!  The flour ratio is wrong though.  In order to form the "potato dough" you will need a bunch of flour.  Once cooked freezes well for a fast meal (just thaw in a pot of boiling water).

These were fabulous. I prepared them a few hours in advance and placed them on a sheet of wax paper/cookie sheet in the fridge. They were fine and maybe the cooling firmed them up a bit and made for a nicer and even cooking. Once removed from the water I put them right into a pan with shallots, parsley and butter...YUMMO

I loved these!  I used  2 med size yams.  I ended up using almost 4 cups of flour that's part of what i used on the board to roll out the dough (really it was more like streaching it out).  It was sticky but i did knead it a bit longer adding a bit more flour each time.  I did try it with alittle brown sugar about 2 tbs and some cinnimon, as recomend by some others. I also tossed them with some evoo when the came out of the pot. I served it with a mushroom alfreado sause(bought) and some baked chicken breast.  I would totally make this for company! fyi: They freeze well, not quite as pretty looking, but oh so tasty. (froze with sauce and chicken)

WOW! I made this after Thanksgiving.  I cooked the gnocchi in turkey soup and it was awesome! As many reviews suggested have lots of flour and keep the gnocchi small.  Uncooked they freeze well.

I love sweet potatoes, I've made gnocchi lots of times, however, this recipe falls short...very gooey dough?
added more and more flour, added more nutmeg and salt. flavorless...ended up making a butter, brown sugar, maple syrup glaze sauce and that tasted good but mainly the sweetness covered up the bland gnocchi. a waste of sweet potatoes. sorry will not make this again.

Very labor intensive and kind of bland.  Potatoes took forever to bake.  Ended up mashing in a food processor. Rolled into very small snakes a little bit at a time, as recommended by another poster, and that made it okay. But ultimately too much effort for "eh" reactions from the hubby and kid.  Actually, kid refused to eat it.  Hubby ate it, but didn't say anything. 
Used the remainder of the dough mixed with brown sugar and cinnamon to make fritters that we're eating with honey butter.  It tastes much better fried.

An excellent recipe that produced a fine meal.  I am wondering if it would be possible to make a gluten free/dairy free  version for those in my family that have dietary restrictions.  Maybe use
brown rice flour  and or almond flour with some arrowroot starch.

Heres the trick to making these that they are light and airy. I make them up like mashed potatoes butter , milk ,salt  let them cool then add 2 eggs, nutmeg mix that in start off with a cup of flour get your hands messy the trick is adding enough flour to the un sticky point flour surface and kneed folding in extra flour to flour over the dough. cut nice size portion and roll out like play dough in a long log. I use a floured fork to roll them on keep a little pile of flour on the side to dip the fork in after you make them stick them on a tray and put them in the freezer no need to cover after 20 min to 1/2 hour check and see if they are semi frozen that helps them keep the shape. These cook super quick when they float let them sit in the water for a few min more and they are ready to dress with Gravy/ sauce/ butter/browned butter. sure its a little more work but I haven bought these for a long time and I got no complaints! However I get asked when am I making these again LOL

I’ve made this twice and both times it turned out great. I found that rolling all the dough into roughly 12” snakes, transferring the roles to parchment paper as I finished each one, and then cutting them all at once really speeds things up and keeps the pieces uniform. You can tidy up the individual pieces if you feel the need. I didn’t. My family loves this recipe. I actually got a collective “yeah” when I said I was making it again.

I made this and my wife and I loved it.  The second time I made it  I added some honey to the recipe.  All the other ingredients dilute the sweetness of the sweet potatoes.  The honey helped bring it back out.

Didn't make too many changes.  Used a little more than the 8oz called for, had to add some additional flour.  While the gnocchi were good, they float when they are cooked, they didn't have a rich sweet potato taste.  I will make them again, but play around with different ingredients.

Made this and normal potato gnocchi at the same time. Normal gnocchi was a lot easier to make and needed less flour and wasn't as dense as the sweet potato gnocchi . Was nice, but not as nice as normal gnocchi .

Was delicious!! Found it a bit more challenging to make than with potato as it’s incredibly sticky. What worked for me was rice flour on my hands and on the surface that you’re going to roll the dough on. Works like a charm! Served with a chunky napolitana sauce and topped with a bit of chili and parmesan. Yum :)

Our go-to recipe for gnocchi! So delicious. It’s definitely important not to use too much flour in order to get the right texture. These also freeze very well, so I alway double the recipe (since I’m making a big mess anyway...)

I probably won't make this again. The recipe was easy enough, and came out well but I really hate the taste of sweet potato, and these tasted like sweet potatoes. I thought maybe the flour would make the flavor dull enough I wouldn't mind but it did not. That being said once put in some sauce and some Parmesan cheese, it was still very good.

To be honest I didn't really measure but  watch Chef John's  video on making gnocchi. I microwaved about 2 1/2 lbs. of sweet potatoes, 2 eggs, a little sprinkle of salt and then added dough a little at a time until it barely held together and then cut into about 6 chunks, rolling into a snake and cutting into 1/2 inch pieces. I even did the fork roll. Not perfectly done but pretty good. I boiled them in a pot of salted water until they floated. I put them in some of my homemade spaghetti sauce. My husband didn't know what to think of them but my daughter and I loved them, as did my grands. I think next time I would like a different sauce because my sauce really overpowered the gnocchi.  It was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta. I can't wait to make some to freeze. It was a fun project with my 6-year granddaughter.

A tip for anyone trying to make these in less than 2 hours, microwave your sweet potatoes rather than bake them! It takes far longer than 30 minutes in the oven to get the potato soft enough to mash. Easy fix: wet the potatoes, wrap them in saran wrap, and microwave them instead!

Delish!! We tried this recipe and loved it! This was my first time making gnocchi and I couldn't believe how simple it was. Initially tried serving it with a fantastic tomato sauce (that we slaved over), but quickly determined a simple herb butter/parm combo was better suited to balance out the flavours of the dish. We also chopped the sweet potatoes before baking them in an attempted to speed things up, but would recommend baking them whole if you have the time to avoid roasting and browning. Will definitely be working off this recipe in the future.

They were very tasty, but I made a terrible mess in my kitchen.  I even tried the ziplock baggie suggestion, but that somehow made an even bigger mess.  They are good enough that I'll make them again.  Maybe with better planning I'll be able to do a neater job.

I'm a total newbie chef.  Whenever I make this recipe, I end up with super sticky dough and end up adding a ton of flour to get it to even resemble something to work with.  I'm not sure if it is me though.  I did enjoy the overall flavor of this recipe and have made it on more than one occasion.

Great stuff, however. Giving 4 stars due to cooking time of the sweet potato. An 8oz sweet potato takes about an hour at 350° F. This could be oven specific, however my sweet potatoes were still rocks at 30 min. ;-)

Im SO happy i came across this recipe!..what a fantastic Idea!!! I didnt follow this recipe to a T..as i used leftover mashed sweet potato(a recipe from this site with maple syrup). This came together beautifully!..and i LOVED the addition of the nutmeg. I used 1 cup of mashed potatoes total, along with the 1 egg and flour suggested. Although did need to increase the flour by about 1/2 cup..but i figure that's because i had additional moisture when made the sweet potatoes. Mine took about 4 minutes to boil, and then i immediately transferred them to a hot skillet with a touch of olive oil for about 1 minute to lightly brown. I served with an additional sprinkle of nutmeg and sea salt .What a wonderful Sweet/Savory dish :)

Made this a couple times according to the recipe, and it was delicious. Then I subbed carrots for the sweet potatoes, and it was still great :)

Time saving tips: I microwave the potatoes/carrots instead of roasting. I also don't mess around with rolling and cutting, just pinch off pieces of dough and throw them in the water. Obviously they're not as pretty that way, but they taste just as good and are way quicker and easier.

I made this VEGAN! I used Energ Egg Replacer instead of an egg, and tonight [when I make this awesome recipe again] I'm going to try a flax-egg. I baked the potatoes for 30 minutes, then let them sit in the oven (turned off) for about 10 more. I rolled the pasta into very thin, short "snakes" to control the size better and ran it over it with a hot fork that i'd left on the oven. I was really surprised by how fluffy these were even on my first try! So very filling too! I made a creamy pasta sauce with mixed vegetables to top this delightful dish, and what a wonderful meal it turned out to be! Thanks for the recipe. ;)

I've made this recipe twice now, and overall it is really good.  That being said, its only alright when its cooked immediately, but awesome if you chill or freeze the gnocchi before boiling them.  And the prep time is always longer than half an hour.  I used an all purpose gluten free flour (celiac disease), mama's blend the first time and pillsbury the second.  I add 1.5 cups to the sweet potato mix and see how sticky it is.  The first time I made it with extra big sweet potatoes apparently, because it took about 2.5 cups to get it workable.  The second time it took 1.5 cups mixed in to get it sticky but workable. I tried rolling the dough, but it was much faster and easier when I squeezed it out of a bag with the corner cut off onto a floured surface.  You can make them pretty by pressing a fork into them, but I don't normally bother. I like to boil them til they float, then sautee them in sage butter right before serving.

Really tasty! I subbed sweet potato for butternut squash and pureed it with some water instead of mashing it. Then I served it with feta alfredo sauce. At first I was a little befuddled but I quickly got the hang of making the gnocchi. Delish!

This was my first attempt at making gnocchi.  Thanks so much for a delicious and easy to follow recipe!  I used some of the reviewers tips by microwaving potatoes and only using 1 1/2 cups of flour.  Sautéed with shallots and brown butter.  Yum!

These were wonderful!  They were so easy and once the sweet potatoes were cooked, were a snap to assemble and cook. Omitted nutmeg and garlic, still were tasty.  May add in next time.  Served with Pork Tenderloin with Mushroom Ragout and they were scarfed by my two sweet potato hating family members (along with a request to make again).  Liked the idea of serving with a little sage brown butter next time!!

Second time:  Added 3 cloves of garlic shredded on a microplane.  Added 4 T browned butter with 1 T dried sage, juice of 1/2 lemon and topped with shredded parm cheese.  YUM!!!

This is a family favorite, and is divine when cooked, fished out into a bowl to drain, then sauteed in crispy sage brown butter. I make a double or triple batch, starting with about 2/3 of the flour recommended, add nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon, and fridge the dough for a day or so (it'll be play dough texture on top and wetter inside). Cover tightly in plastic wrap; otherwise, the air exposure turns the dough from bright orange to brown. It makes for pretty marbled gnocchi with the two colors, though. I flour the top of a big blob, then flour the bottom, and roll into snakes on a floured baking mat. Roll to about a finger thickness and use a paring knife to cut small pillows about 1/2 x 1". You really do want small; I've made them way bigger and they just turn into enormous dumplings. Freeze half on parchment paper (not touching much), then dump into a freezer bag when frozen solid. Boil from frozen (it will take a few mins longer, but thawing will result in mushing together).

These were super tasty, but also super messy and time-consuming. It definitely took longer than 35 minutes for me, and it got really frustrating trying to get the dough into small enough balls to cook. HOWEVER if you're willing to get a little messy and spend some time to get it right, they are super tasty! To those who have never had gnocchi, it's supposed to be similar to a dumpling. If it comes out too rubbery for your liking (I personally like them a little more cooked than most chefs make it), try boiling them for less time.

Pretty simple and yummy.  I microwaved my potatoes for about 10 minutes ahead of time and mashed them with the garlic, salt and pepper (I didn't have nutmeg).  About a half hour before dinner I gradually added the flour - I used about 1.5 cups and generously added flour to the rolling board.  I used my floured hands to roll them into 'snakes' and cut into small pieces.  I would cut about 20 pieces at a time - throw them into boiling water - cut up some more and then transfer the cooked gnocchi to a pot with my warmed Alfredo sauce.  It didn't seem to take too long.  I find gnocchi to be fairly bland already and I thought the sweet potato version was tastier!  Would be tempted to add some bacon to the sauce next time....

My suggestion is to keep the dough a bit on the thin side by using less flour and more egg.  Then, put it into a pastry tube with a large star tip and squeeze it out while cutting gnocchis off with scissors. Let the gnocchi fall directly into the boiling water.  This cuts the time needed in half and is much less fussy. You may find it takes two people to do this, but it is well worth it.

Delicious flavor; add more salt as well.

Rather than rolling the dough. I piped it in long rows on wax paper with my accent decorator gun, froze it & then cut them into small pastas. I also added a pinch of cinnamon & orange zest. Plan to serve with vanilla bean cognac sauce & lobster.

I only gave this 2 stars just because it was the first time that I tried this and it didn't turn out at all. The potatoes that I thought were sweet potatoes ended up being purple potatoes and I think thats part of the reason it didn't turn out. They were really soft and not at all like the gnocchi that my boss had made. Sad it didn't turn out but I know that if I keep working at it these they would be amazing. Great idea...

Two tips to make this a 30-minute meal instead of 2-3 hours as one reviewer said.

1. Use precooked sweet potato or butternut squash (in the frozen section of your supermarket).

2. Make the dough a squeezable rather than rollable consistency and put it in a pastry bag or ziploc bag (as another reviewer suggested). Squeeze the dough a little at a time and cut with kitchen shears right into your pot of boiling water. 

You'll have to pause and scoop out the floaters as they finish cooking, but this method is much faster than  hand rolling the dumplings. And, in my opinion, the amount of flour you have to use to make the gnocchi rolling consistency completely ruins the texture and flavor of the gnocchi.

Mine came out tender and delicate not gummy and doughy.

The sweet potatoes took a super long time to bake in the oven...much longer than the recipe said.  It was a pretty sticky dough but don't add too much flour and make your gnocchi tasteless either.  I think mine turned out pretty good.  I served them with a simple brown butter and they were really filling.  My husband and I both had two servings from this batch and I probably have another 3 servings I put into the freezer for another day.  It was a little bit bland, though, I'm not sure what else you could add to it to make it more exciting but it was a nice comfort food on next to no money.

This took 1h30 min start to finish, and I baked the potatoes in the microwave.  The tip about "soft dough" was dead on, and I also took the other advice on here and added cinnamon and brown sugar (just a touch of the former and 1 1/2 tsp of the latter).  I only used probably 1 1/2 cups of the flour for the recipe itself, and another 1/4 for the rolling of the dough.  Once the gnocchi were all boiled, I stir-fried them with olive oil and 3 more chopped garlic cloves and served it topped with fresh basil and grated parmesan.  Next time I make this, I'll use my plastic cutting board; the gnocchi ended up tasting a little like the wood from the one I used.  Anyone know how to find the tofu cream sauce recipe someone else mentioned?  Couldn't find it and it sounds yummy!

This was a lot easier than I figured. I used cinnamon since I didn't have any nutmeg. I didn't measure the flour, just kept adding until right consistency. Very yummy, and will definitely make again.

I'm not a great cook...and have never made gnocchi before, but this turned out okay.  The recipe is good, the only things I'll change in the future have to do with my cooking style.  For example, you might want to make the individual gnocchi's smaller rather than bigger to help with cooking, and make sure you use flour when rolling it out...pretty sticky, but the end product is worth it.

Very easy and turned out great.  It was definitely too moist for rolling and cutting; the squeeze bag and scissors method worked well, except for the boiling water splashing back.

This recipe can be a little tricky--try adding flour just a little at a time until the dough is workable.  Too much flour will make it tough.  I saute these after they are boiled, in a little butter with sage and garlic.  I'm serving this for Thanksgiving for my vegetarian husband--who loves them!

This was my first attempt at gnocchi and definitely not worth the effort. I love sweet potatoes, and I'm not sure what I was expecting, but these came out like gummy, tasteless blobs of dough! I ended up throwing away most of sticky stuff after tasting the first samples. Maybe a different recipe with more seasonings to flavor the dough, and working on my size/shape technique would have better results, but I probably won't be making gnocchi again any time soon.
