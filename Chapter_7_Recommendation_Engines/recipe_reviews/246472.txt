Yep, this is how to make rice balls :) Wet your hands, add a little salt and form the rice into a ball, adding a filling in the middle. Best fillings are seeded umeboshi and this cook seaweed thing called "gohan desu yo". Tunafish w/mayo in the middle of rice is a little odd, but it wasn't bad, and I made it with brown rice. I love the taste of nori with rice so you really cannot go wrong!
