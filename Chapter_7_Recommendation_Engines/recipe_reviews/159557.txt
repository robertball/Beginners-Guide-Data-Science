Very nice; use the best quality you can find or it will taste rather muddy. First time I made it with premium bar stock it was not that nice. Second time (my husband loves Scotch) I used a premium Russian vodka and a premium single malt Scotch....delish!

This was an interesting combination.  I made only half the recipe and still have some left for tonight (I removed the ice).  This was OK, but probably not my favorite.  I'd rather either have all vodka or all scotch.  But it was worth the try!  Thanks, Dr. Falk!
