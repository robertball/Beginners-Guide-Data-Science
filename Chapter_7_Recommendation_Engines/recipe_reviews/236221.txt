I didn't use aloe juice,  since I have the plant I use the pulp, I cut the recipe in half but still got 2 servings of juice, I try it  and is good, you can feel the kick of the cayenne pepper at the end, I use my nutribullet and the consistency is like a smoothie.

I subbed coconut water for the aloe vera juice since it was way to expensive to try just once.  A Vitamix would be perfect to blend smooth.

This is a great drink! The aloe turns it into a super cleanse. The portion is huge, though. Just cut it in half and you'll be able to finish a 16 oz drink.
