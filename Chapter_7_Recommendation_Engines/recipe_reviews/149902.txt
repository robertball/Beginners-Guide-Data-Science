This is a big messy yummy burger.  After reading reviews I adjusted the amounts of some of the seasonings and it worked great:  I used 1 lb ground beef for 3 burgers, and used 1 tsp Worcestershire, 3 TBL Frank's buffalo wing sauce, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp seasoned salt, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  Since I had reduced the liquid in the burger, I did not refrigerate them and it worked great and still had lots of flavor.  I brushed on the barbecue sauce while grilling and added no other barbecue sauce or ketchup.  I served on onion rolls with lettuce, tomato, onions and asiago cheese.  I left off the bacon and didn't miss it.  I really enjoyed this burger.  I will make again.

Too many ingredients, hard to match with the rest of the meal. Very so-so.

Too much liquid. Mixing almost 1 cup of liquid into1 pound of meat produces a paste with the texture of oatmeal. Too much fat. Besides the fat in the meat and the added olive oil, buffalo wing sauce is 50% pure grease. Too many flavors competing with the asiago cheese. Asiago pairs well with black pepper and a moderate amount of garlic, but with an entire supermarket condiment department mixed in and smoky bacon on top, you never even know it's there.

Nothing special at all with this recipe - sorry to the poster.  They were just okay and too many different non-jiving ingredients.

Not impressed. Mixing spices into hamburger dries it out. Just dust the outside of the burger.

Per other reviewers, I only used Worcestershire sauce and black pepper in the hamburger. It was okay. I used an Italian blend cheese.

The problem with this recipe is the beef gets completely lost in the other seasonings. It tastes ok, but, it's definitely not my favorite burger recipe.

Despite the reviews I really wanted to try these and I'm glad I did! I followed the recipe as is other than adding mozza with the asiago. Burgers were juicy and tasty a definite keeper.
