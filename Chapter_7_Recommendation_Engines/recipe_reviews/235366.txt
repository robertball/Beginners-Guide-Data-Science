This is probably the fussiest and most labor intensive Italian-American Wedding Soup that you will ever make. It also is one of the very best if you use really good chicken stock (preferably homemade)and the beef with bones as recommended. The compound stock is very silky do to the gelatin and has outstanding flavor with the other ingredients providing a perfect harmony of taste and texture. If making this I strongly suggest quadrupling the stock and freezing it as I guarantee that you will find other uses for it. My Grandma Li has always made compound stocks but usually uses pork instead of beef . So when she tried her hand at the recipe she made hers with pork instead of beef  which is also great but we like the Chef John's original version best - Brandon, the Twins, Pops, and Aunt Gina

BTW - This deserves much more than 5 Stars but that is all we could give it.

Delicious. Made this tonight and it is so tasty. I had lots of greens in frig so used one 10 oz packages of Kale and 1 pkg Southern Greens from Trader Joe's with eggs, heavy whipping cream and bread. Made meatballs with 1 pound ground beef and one pound ground pork gently turning with a wooden spoon to incorporate. Now don't get mad at me Purists, but had to also use Herbs de Provence because because my Anise had walked away and I thought Herbs de Provence would do fine in the meatballs. Baked meatballs and added just before I served. Couldn't
 find Pastina at the fancy grocery store where I bought the Beef Shank but they did have tiny Italian pasta Alphabet things so added those. Strongly recommend using baking sheet for meatballs-used Foil and it was a mess until I rescued the meatballs to a baking pan. Since I am the only one here who loves pasta, now I have lots of meatballs for pasta which I will make and enjoy in secret.

Made this for our annual neighborhood "Soupzilla" competition...(.tied for first place). Meatballs are a little time consuming, but well worth it. Followed the recipe exactly; just found that I like it a little saltier, which was easily fixed! Will definitely keep this on my favorites list.

Chef John, I have not made this yet....I definitely want to try it, but I was wondering, why do you not just use ground beef instead of using a food processor to grind it?

I tasted this once when someone else made it and it was magnificent ... mine turned out okay but not as memorable as theirs ... not to worry though in time I'm sure i'll eventually reach perfection... overall it was great though!

A lot of ingredients but definitely worth it! Great taste and wonderful for cold winter nights! I used different pasta and spinach instead of kale.  Will make again! Thanks Chef John!

This recipe sounds delicious Chef John, and I'm dying to make it, but I believe you're missing an ingredient...the meat for the meatballs!!  This is my 10 year old son's favorite soup and he's patiently awaiting your response!! ;-)
