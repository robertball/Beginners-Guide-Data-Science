I used grilled chicken breasts instead.
When I make the sauce I add 1/4-1/2 tsp. coconut extract and extra cayenne pepper(lots), then spoon the sauce over the chicken.
If you happen to have coconut milk substitute it for the cup of water, you'll not be disappointed.
Yesterday, I made it as the recipe was posted  using breasts and it turned out great.
Don't be squemish about the various ingredients, this is a FABULOUS entreè.
Serve with a Coconut Rice, also from an allrecipes.com posting.
Reminds me of travels to Singapore for Chicken Satè, except no jet lag!

We love spicy, sweet chicken, and this is the best!  If you've never tried it, don't be nervous about mixing peanut butter and chicken, you might be surprised how well the flavors blend together.  We even used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and reduced-fat peanut butter to make this a healthier meal, and it tasted fantastic.

Terrific! I make something similar to this using salsa. Very good too, but I think I like the chili sauce better. Thanks!

Not much flavor other than hot.  The sauce was fine on rice, but didn't do much for the chicken.  My husband liked it, but more as a change of pace.  He agreed it didn't have much flavor other than being (spicy) hot.
