A good basic recipe, however, the oil definitely needs to be cut back. I think the confusion about the "creamy" part of the dressing is due to the wording. The dressing really isn't supposed to become creamy so to speak, but "emulsified". In order to achieve this, you must DRIZZLE the oil into your food processor or blender very, very slowly. If a creamy consistancy is what you prefer, there are other recipes on this site that call for mayo. Thanks Michelle!

This is THE best recipe for Caesar Salad I have EVER tasted. It was a littttttle to oily though, so try adding some pepper. Otherwise it is THE best! :)

I'm sorry, but this recipe is horrible...it is way too oily and it does not get creamy...at least it didn't for me.  Maybe some anchovy paste would help?

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was great.  My only suggestion is to use the juice of a 1/2 lemon, instead of a whole.  Very good!

The garlic taste is a bit overwhelming, but good.  If you don't like a whole lot of garlic, cut it down a bit, and it tastes just as good!

1/2 cup of oil was for 6 people you need to pay attention to the amount of people it serves. We thaught this was a good tasting dressing. Needs to be blended right before serving.

Very strong dressing.  1/2 cup of oil is way too much for a good sized salad for 2.

I had to make this twice because it didn't work out the first time, turns out it didn't work the 2nd time either.  The dressing part never got past the dry crouton stage, it never got near creamy.  I ended up adding a bottled dressing to the dry crouton mixture, then it was good.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and my husband and I both could not take a second bite!  I'm not sure what the taste was in it that was so overpowering, but I wouldn't recommend this salad to anyone that doesn't like very very strong tastes!

I tried this for my family and I. I had just bought a salad emulsifier from the store which came in real handy. This dressing was the most tangy we've ever had!! All three of my kids swallowed it up. I did leave out the croutons from the mix, though. I only added the croutons to the finished result.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I experimented with the ingredients until I found something I liked.  I didn't have croutons or Worcestershire sauce, but I added some red wine vinegar, and that helped it out.  Yum!

I would have given this 5 stars except I messed up a little by not slowly adding the oil and i got a tad too much lemon juice so I had to up mustard and worchestershire sauce to compensate but I still enjoyed it, it wasn't necessarily a Caesar to my taste but I still thought it was good and hey if my 3 year old eats it it must be saying something. Thanks

This had a tangy light dressing. It went well with the romaine and didn't overpower the flavor of other ingredients. It seemed to be missing something though I'm not sure what. Thanks Meesh,  this was good with baked spaghetti.

Wow mine turned out with a very strong mustard taste.  Might have been because the type of dijon mustard I got.  I somehow saved it was some mayo.  It turned out pretty decent after that but I was in a complete panic for a while because I was serving this to guests and didn't have a replacement dressing for the type of food I was serving.

What an easy caesar salad to make!  I used a bag of pre-cut romaine to make it even easier.  I sort of just eyeballed the ingredients and taste tested every now and then.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of mayo for added creaminess.  We threw in a bunch of cooked bacon crumbles for that extra "yum."

This recipe is too oily and seems to be lacking creaminess. It did not thicken at all and it tasted like something was missing. I should have read the reviews and tried mayonaise instead of oil, but I was trying to avoid a processed type dressing.

I like the flavor of the dressing.  It wasn't what I was looking for and 6 cloves of garlic made it  little strong.  Of course, mine could have been too large/too strong etc.  I had to play around with it to hide the strong garlic taste.  I would advise starting off with one or two cloves of garic and working up.  Also, there is no measurement for the olive oil so I had to guess as to what was enough.

I really, really like the flavor of strong garlic but I felt the need to tone it down a bit.  Maybe this particular bulb is stronger than normal.  I also added about a tsp of anchovy paste and less olive oil (I find the anchovy paste to be a necessity!!).  It was great.  I never missed the egg.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.

I thought this recipe seemed a bit strange at first, but man, am I glad I tried it!  It is very good, and veg-heads as well as meat eaters can enjoy it.  I made my own croutons, as many store brands use partially hydrogenated oils in them, so it was even more healthy.  Great salad!

For those who say this recipe is too oily... its simple, use less oil.  I'm italian, I don't measure anyway.  This is an excellent recipe for quick dressing without the use of anchovies.

Based on other reviews, I cut the oil back to 1/4 c + 1T. I prepared the dressing in my food processor to get a good emulsification, and added a touch of anchovy paste because at our house, it isn't Caesar salad if there's no hint of anchovy.Thank for sharing!

Delicious!   I didn't have any croutons on hand and yet the dressing tasted really good.  I like the fact that it is quick and easy to make!  The lemon I used was quite large, so the dressing was a little tart for me, but that is easily remedied for next time.

This turned out pretty good but I didn't get any rave reviews from folks when served at Christmas dinner.  I doubled the recipe and added about 2 tbs. of mayo.  I also used homemade croutons.  I wanted a recipe that didn't call for anchovies so this was it.  I will probably make this again but may look for another option too.

I have used this recipe for years.  It's been my favorite for a long time.  If you're out of croutons you can use crackers to thicken this in a pinch.

As suggested by some of the reviews, I reduced the garlic and added a tbs of mayo.  I omitted the bread crumbs.  The dressing is ok, but it is certainly not a caesar dressing.  I would call it something else.  I will probably not try this one again.

This was good, but the flavor was not quite balanced.

I added a small spoonful of mayo (an easy egg sub for body) and a couple dashes of fish sauce (for the flavor note of anchovy without the work) and it was better with those additions.

I do like the nuanced flavor of anchovy in ceasar dressing.

I just made this and it does indeed turn out creamy without adding mayo or egg.  I crushed about 6 cloves garlic, but started with 3 for a doubled recipe.  After taste test I added three more cloves to about 1 cup olive oil, 2 T grey poupon, juice of 1 juicy lemon.  By drizzling in a very thin stream when adding the olive oil to the blender, I got a nice creamy dressing.  Also didn't have Worchestershire sauce so I used Maggi seasoning.  Also added about 12 med sized crushed croutons which really enhanced the whole thing.  Very Good!

This was good, but the taste was missing something.  Maybe the egg and anchovy.  I am pregnant, so I cant eat a dressing that calls for raw egg (Normally if I know the eggs are fresh and make it myself so I know they are handled properly this isn't a problem.  Come on people, does anyone really know someone who has gotten sick from eating a touch of raw cookie dough or cake batter?) so I tried this one.  I love garlic, but decided to cut it in half since my husband doesn't.  It still smelled very garlicky, but didn't taste like a ton of garlic.  It was however, pretty lemony.  Be sure to use fresh lemon juice from an actual lemon, not bottled!  I added a touch of S & P as well.  Next time I'll add anchovy paste.

I tried this salad for the 1st time for a novelty party. My friends LOVED it! It was requested again for a brunch and people were mad when it ran out! Now everytime we have a get together, this salad is my ticket to get in the door!

Overall, fairly good.  Way too much garlic though - it burned everyones mouths!  I made it again only using 3 cloves and it was still garlicky but not quite so overpowering!

Awesome recipe! I had to double it since we used it for Thanksgiving, but I only added 1/2 cup of olive oil and one lemon, as opposed to doubling it. My family loved it and the kids asked for seconds! I will make this again for sure!

My husband and I, caesar salad and anchovy lovers both, adored this recipe.  I made sure to put in 1/4 c. lemon juice to offset the olive oil, added extra garlic, and blended it all in my food processer.  It had a crisp, light flavor.  There were only two of us and we had none leftover!

This was good, but to make it better, put dry mustard and add salt while mixing the dressing. I also put tarragon in mine and it was terrific

Brought this to a neighbors dinner gathering and everyone loved it! It was easy to make. Depending on your taste for lemon, you may want to adjust the amount of lemon juice. But the lemon juice is what makes it taste so fresh! I topped it w/ Trader Joes Parmesan crisps and shave parmesan and it was perfect. Will make this again!

Yes, do reduce the garlic, unless you LOVE garlic.  I used 3 cloves and think cutting it down to 2 would even be fine.  Followed everything else.  Do add the olive oil SLOWLY and it will become creamy.  Thanks for great sald and recipe!

I thought the lemon was overpowering and made the dressing a little too tart. I also added black olives and fresh roma tomatoes--which were a good choice. This recipe went over okay with my family, but not my favorite.
