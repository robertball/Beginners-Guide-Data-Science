So simple. I made the yellow cake and cool whip from scratch and it made it that much better.

This was so easy and really good, even better the next day. I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make it again. I will try adding fresh bananas before the whipped topping as others suggested for sure, but it tastes awesome as is.  I Not sure why another didn't like the texture of the cake. It was very creamy and moist for me. I used Jello brand instant pudding and whole milk. This would be great at a potluck.

My family loves this cake.  I add 3 or 4 sliced bananas over the top, before I put the whip cream on. Yummy!

It was just okay to us. One thing I would suggest doing is pouring the pudding mixture on the cake right after you mix it! Mix it quickly too!! If you wait even a minute or two, it’s too thick to go down into the holes! Ours ended up just sitting on top. Over all, it was okay. We didn’t love the artificial banana flavoring from the pudding. I’ll try a different flavor pudding next time maybe!

Just a standard yellow cake with some pudding and whipped cream on top instead of frosting.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.  It was extremely easy to make, but I’m not sure I would make it again.

I made this cake and the family loved it! I did make the pudding on the stove top as I couldn't find instant banana pudding. And I whipped the cream instead of cool whip. I also added sliced bananas on top,of the cake before the whipped cream. These changes added time and steps to the recipe but I think it was worth it. I prefer fresh whipped cream to cool whip. 

I would make this again with maybe coconut or white chocolate pudding.

Really good! We couldn’t eat all of it right away but after about a week the cake started to get a little bit of a  funky texture.

I have made this 3 times now and my family and friends all love it. I made home made banana cake twice which was more dense . I also used cool whip once and real whipped cream twice. My family votes for the real whipped cream!

Thia recipe was pretty good. I used fresh bananas in the batter and used vanilla pudding instead of banana pudding. I also whipped bananas into my cream topping which I made from scratch.

I didn’t wait to make the pudding like the recipe said, so the cake was not as moist. It was good and would make again.

Was a hit at a pot luck. I would like to try to thin out the pudding mix so it absorbs into the cake. The way I made it, the pudding sat on top. Will be back here to update after I try a second time. BTW, per another review, I added sliced bananas to the top before putting on the cool whip.

Loved it. How would you suggest this recipe be changed to make a chocolate pudding cake instead of a banana one?
