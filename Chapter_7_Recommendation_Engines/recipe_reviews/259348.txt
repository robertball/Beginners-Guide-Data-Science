Delicious. I used 2 slices of turkey bacon and changed the kale out for more beet greens. Quick, easy, healthy and tasty.

Use only beet greens (did not have any kale). Used hard chirizo instead of bacon, add one finely chopped Fresno pepper with the garlic. Fantastic, will make again

While I didn't love this my husband did. I'm just not a huge a kale fan. The recipe makes a small portion and I would double if I was making this for more than 1-2 people.
