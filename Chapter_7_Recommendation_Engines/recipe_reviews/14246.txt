Great salad, perfect for a summer BBQ.  It is very easy, but if you have extra time it is great with bananas and strawberries instead of the fruit cocktail.

Easy recipe for fruit salad.  My husband doesn't like coconut and I forgot to buy marshmallows, but I mixed about a tablespoon of brown sugar into the sour cream before adding it to the fruit and it was a nice sidedish.

My mother made this when my sister and I were kids. I made it the other day for the first in years. MMM, did it ever bring back memories. It was my husband's first taste and he likes it. My dad naturally ate the most out of all of us.

This recipe was a big hit. I substituted fresh grapes and whole maraschino cherries for the fruit cocktail. I didn't stick to the "cup" rule. I just combined the quantities of fruit and coconut I had, and added the sour cream to taste.

I thought this salad was very cool and refreshing. It was an easy version of ambrosia which I love. The sour cream was a refreshing addition, it cut the sweetness of the overall salad. I really loved it and have made it alot since the first time.

This one is a keeper...if you like cherries use fruit cocktail with extra cherries like DelMonte's 
"Very Cherry". This is great for picnics or summer parties.I like to make it for Easter too~

What an easy summer dessert! I did use more marshmellows than called for but it turned out great! Looked great in the mold I used. I thought about adding 1/2c walnuts but held back (although I may try that addition next time I make this).  Super easy with great results.  I brought home an empty mold from the BBQ we attended a couple weeks back and gave the recipe out to a friend. Thanks Marcy!

I really enjoyed this. Instead of the fruit cocktail I added strawberries and bananas as suggested by another reviewer and it was awesome. I used powdered sugar instead of coconut because someone didnt care for it, but next time I will use the coconut. It was very simple to make and I loved the taste.

My husband used to have this recipe when he lived in the dorm in college.  It's now one of his favorite salads to have at home.  We use light sour cream instead of regular.  I'm now adding it to the menu of the nursing home where I work.  It's so easy to fix.

Came out great! Even those who don't care for sour cream all that much may like this dish. I used some of the fruit juice as others suggested, and the combination of the fruit juice and sour cream makes a great flavor combination. Very easy to adjust the types of fruit and amount of sour cream to your liking.

This was as close as I could find to my grandmother's recipe, but I added cottage cheese & walnuts. Love this one and will be using it again.

this is a very refreshing salad, my family loves it with the changes I made.  Instead of coconut I use 1 cup chopped walnuts and only use pineapple tidbits and mandarin oranges for the fruit.  I have been making this for years and it is always requested at family get together.

This recipe has been in my family for 20 plus years, and we always have it on Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have modified it now with my kids and use toasted coconut and sometimes I will use only mandarin oranges and marachino cherries. My girls love it with just cherries and coconut and marshmellows too.

This is a version of one I make quite often.  My version does not include the oranges, pineapple or coconut and I use the regular marshmallows not coloured.  Either way though it has to be the easiest and bes tasting fruit salad to make ever !!!

I really prefer fresh fruit for salads, but if you need to use canned fruit this is a good combination.

I sampled this at a recent lunch.  Since I asked for the recipe, obviously I enjoyed it.  The chef substituted 1 cup of frozen blueberries for the fruit cocktail.  Very refreshing.  I think grapes would be a nice addition too.

Almost a duplicate of my Nanny's salad, which was one of the high points of any visit to her house in the summer.  She must not have liked coconut, so she used a drained can of fruit cocktail instead.  I truly loved the sweet/tang/crunch/squish (marshmallows) of this wonderful dish as a child, and look forward to supplying this treat to my future grandchildren.

I made this for Easter 2011. Mainly because I seen the cutest bunny marshmallows at the store and knew I wanted to use them for some dish. Well, my family couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was. I had 20 people over and 10 asked for the recipe. I will definitely continue to add this dish to our party menus. Easy to make and inexpensive...a perfect combination!

I make this recipe often and don't use the fruit cocktail.  I think that makes it six cup salad instead of five. It is really good though and keeps great in the fridge.

I'm not sure what went wrong here, but mine turned to a runny soupy mess and had no flavor.  I drained all of the fruit really well, so I'm not sure what the problem was.

OK, so it's another form of Ambrosia but it's still yummy isn't it? If your kids aren't coconut fans, omit the coconut and add more marshmallows. I did and it was great!

Wonderful (and wonderfully easy) recipe!  I, like DEENIE65, didn't follow the cup rule, but it still turned out very well.  I substituted fresh navel oranges for the mandarins, and marshmallow creme for the marshmallows (same measurements).

For simplicity's sake, I did cans instead of cups. I left out the coconut because I hate it and I subbed plain greek yogurt for the sour cream because it's healthier. Added apples. This was a good recipe that is easy to modify to your own preferences.

This was just okay.  It had been a while since I've had this, so I didn't remember the exact ingredients.  After making it I remembered that my mom always used crushed pineapple and no fruit cocktail.  I didn't care for this near as much as the way I'm used to having it made.  Also, I cut back on the sour cream and added a little sugar, because I could taste a strong sour cream flavor.
