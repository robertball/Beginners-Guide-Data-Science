Not everyone is raised learning how to cook.  One thing I LOVE about this site is sharing the differences and regional varieties to things I've become accustomed to while growing up.  My sons are in their early-mid 20's and never "grasped" what I tried to teach; except they both prefer making their own meals rather than having fast food - therefore I think this is a fantastic addition to AR family!  Thanks for sharing this staple recipe - my boys sure appreciate it too!

What can you say about the original?  I love grilled cheese, it is a great hot meal with soup when it is just me for dinner.  I like to add ham to mine.

I gave this a rating b/c I had to, but I have made grilled cheese since I was little and I didn't need this recipe's help.  Which leads me to some questions, not to be rude, but - do people really not know how to make a grilled cheese, and can you really post a recipe such as this and take credit for it?  
I like to use my George Foreman grill for grilled cheese.  Its easy, quick, healthy, and virtually no clean up - you don't have to scrub a buttery pan.

Allrecipes wouldn't be truly have all recipes without this one, and I wouldn't have thought to cook it had I not run across it while in stump as to what to make. Try some variations based upon what is available to you, and what you like in a normal sandwich, always good!

I personally like grilled cheese with processed cheese slices as it gets that ooey-gooeyness! At home I ALWAYS use onion and sometimes ham or turkey. I think I will try the suggestion of bacon like one reviewer said. Maybe try to mix an american slice with a swiss slice too, it's nummy! Oh also, I saw a tip on another toasted sandwich recipe from this site saying to keep it from getting soggy is to toast the bread first. It works and I'll never go back to the old way! I lightly toast the bread, let it cool on wooden cutting board (so butter won't melt), then butter and grill.

What is better than a classically prepared grilled cheese?  This is a great sandwich.  I agree with ~TNT~ adding that tomato is a must!

Okay, Mike - I was looking for a baked cheese sandwich and came across this. Then, I was curious to find out why in the title this was a favorite? THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I MAKE MY GRILLED CHEESE! I did not know there was a recipe for a basic grilled cheese? Then, again I think I have seen recipes on here for baked potatoes and fried eggs. I haven't come across toast yet, but haven't looked! Either way, I use somewhat less butter and sometimes 1 1/2 pieces of cheese. Cook the grilled cheese on no higher than 5 and only flip once. No flattening the grilled cheese with a spatula either! Follow this and you will get a buttery crispy delicious grilled cheese.

I have to say; hey, love that the site put this up, cuz some out there wouldn't know the delight of the original grilled cheese!
My version?  I put mayonnaise on the inside of the bread with the American cheese; and yes, a nice med-low heat to get the perfect crunchy "grilled" flavor.  Dont know why, but this is a favorite of almost every person I know!

Had to put in my "2 cents" because this really is the best way to make grilled cheese. I melt my butter in the microwave and brush it on the bread. I got a kick out of "Paintballmommy's" review because most of us learned from the time we were seven how to make grilled cheese. However, I must justify this "recipe" by saying that although my family gets a homemade cooked meal six days a week and they know that I can pretty much tell them how to make most dishes, the kids do enjoy surfing this site to find things they can cook with their friends. Although they're teens now, they've been doing this since I joined. Just for fun, try putting a bit of minced red onion and barbeque sauce on your cheese before you grill. I love it; especially when I use cheddar. YUMMO!

This is one of my favorite classic sandwiches. I stick some dill pickle chips in the sandwich after the cheese is melted. Yummy!

I honestly didn't realize All Recipes would print this. Grilled cheese has been around & the know how forever. had to check it out. Nothen different than the "original" way. The fun thing is add stuff to sandwich as in ham, garlic salt, pickle, onion. be creative.

I've pretty much made this before I knew it was a recipe on this site. This time, I followed the recipe exactly, using unsalted butter and Honey Wheat bread. I found the results to be OK, nothing special. First, I thought there was too much butter - 1 T. might've been enough. Second, the "medium-high" heat seemed to be too much - the edges of the bread quickly turned black,  before the cheese was fully melted. This is a simple sandwich, I know, but that was my particular experience. Thanks anyway.

This is the BEST way to make a grilled cheese - the secret is using real butter, not margarine, softened and smoothed on all the way to the crust's edge -  I switch out american cheese with shredded mozzerella and sprinkle the inside with a touch of garlic powder and pre-mixed "italian seasoning" in a jar for a yummy italian-style sandwich.

Good basic recipe.  I like to add to it. sliced tomatoes, bacon, ham.  Sometimes whatever is leftover in the fridge.  Also the best way to cut a grilled cheese is with a pizza cutter !

A true classic... And so what if it seems basic and/or obvious to some people? All cooks have to start somewhere, even if it's boiling an egg or making grilled cheese... Anyway, if you want to gourmet this up a little, try the 'Greek Grilled Cheese' recipe on this site. Super awesome!! (Oh, and if you're interested in dropping a few calories, make your grilled cheese the British way - toast your bread, top with cheese, then throw it under the broiler until the cheese is brown and bubbly. Yum!)

The basic grilled cheese, but when I was pregnant; I couldn't get enough cheese. Soooo I added cream cheese on one of the inside layers of bread after I put it on the pan and put the cheese on top of the cream cheese. Still love it to this day.

Classic grilled cheese.  The only  thing I can add is it makes a huge difference to cook low and slow.  Low heat and slow cooking will give you a really nice toasty crunch.  My 12 year old just learned how to make his own, and is a pro.

this is the best recipie for grilled cheese i can think of. Ive tried many different variations, including provalone or swiss, and also potato bread. If you really got a hunger pang, make it with a double (or even triple?) layer of cheese.

This site is named ALLrecipes dot com not Totally new and never seen before recipes dot com.  Therefore I believe this classic recipe deserves a place here.  Watch a few cooking shows and you will notice that many amateur cooks will put a big blob of butter in a pan to cook grilled cheese but never butter the bread.  Apparently not everyone knows how to cook a proper grilled cheese and I am glad Mike posted this for people to find.  Been making it like this since childhood and even substitute cheeses every now and then.  But classic recipes deserve a place here along with more advanced recipes.

To melt the cheese before the bread burns, put a small ice cube in the pan with the bread and cover it with a lid from a sauce pot.  The steam melts the cheese pronto.

I am too lazy to butter the bread, I just put the butter pat in the skillet and let it that way. Then, when I flip it over I do the same thing, holding the sandwich on my spatula in the air for the 30 seconds it takes to melt the butter. As far as our sandwiches go, we like to sometimes add tomato slices and/or bacon slices. Pair this with tomato soup and you have a tasty meal!

Love a grilled cheese every once in awhile! The BEST way to eat a grilled cheese is with some chili in it...seriously! Try it and you'll be hooked as I was! For those college students, canned chili even. BTW...eat with fork, may be messy :)

An all time classic.  I make them this way all the time.  Sometimes I add a little ham or ham and onion.  Another slight change is to brush the bread with a little olive oil and omit the butter.  It makes the bread a litte crisper.  As I said though an all time classic!!!

I like a little more margarine on mine. Largely dependent on the quality of bread and cheese used. Awesome served with tomato soup. Best with velveeta slices...yum.

My 84-year-old Aunt makes these and adds some - or several - drops/dollops (i.e. to taste) of sundried tomato salad dressing to the cheese filling before flipping to cook the other side. Five stars w/ the SDT dressing!

Not sure if a recipe is needed for this, but for a new cook this is a great basic grilled cheese and to switch it up a bit use different bread with differnt cheeses like whole honey wheat with brie cheese or Italian bread with mozzarella, provelone, and parmeasan chesse. Add any kind of meat you like Can make this a whole lot of  ways YUM YUM

This is THE way to make an awesome grilled cheese! I read the reviews and I am definitely going to try it in the Foreman grill now. It's delicious with Campbell's Tomato Bisque. Dip the sandwich in it!

Easy and good. Placing the butter on the bread first made the grilling less messy. The only challange is making the flip. I've made it twice and the cheese has never melted enough to stick to the top of the bread. You'll also need to watch out for the bread 'cuz it browns fast when the heats up.

This recipe really helped me and practically saved my butt. Today my parents asked me to watch my little brother for a little while so they can run some errands. And around lunch time he got really hungry and asked for a grilled cheese, and for my first time I made a grilled cheese with this recipe. Thanks!

Using two kinds of cheeses works as well!  I like using Colby-Jack and Cheddar. I bake in oven, spraying both sides of sandwich with cooking spray and it's yummy, not soggy.

To make this "Old Classic" a little different at times, place some thin slices of chipped ham or thin slices of red sweet onion or a slice of garden fresh tomato on the cheese and let it melt into it. Use your imagination with this. You will be surprised of the good flavors you will taste.

Classic Recipe!  I like mine with a lot of butter flavor so I put butter on both sides of the bread, some in the pan (as well as cooking spray).  I then put the bread in and toast one side, then flip and add cheese, then cook other side.  Might be more fattening, but it sure tastes good!

I was so curious to see what "Mike's Favorite " might include! LOL. This is the best way to prep a grilled cheese, and for the record... I like mine best with  thinly sliced tomatoes between the cheese slices!
(Linda McLeans idea as to BBQ sauce and minced red onion sounds pretty good, as well).
The possibilities are endless here... grilled cheese sandwiches are just that good!

I have been making these for years. Grilled chesse is the best, right up there with peanut butter and jelly! A quick and easy lunch with a bowl of your favorite soup. Someone recently suggested I try spreading some mayo on the cheese, not bad at all! Try grilled ham and swiss on rye or grilled cheese with tomato.

This is THE ONLY WAY to make a grilled cheese sandwich...what you do with it now is up to you.  I highly recommend adding your favorite mustard to the inside of the sandwich before grilling, or some thinly sliced tomato, or very thinly sliced onion, use your favorite cheese (my hubby loves pepper jack!) and favorite bread (sliced sourdough is awesome).  The possibilites are endless!

I use as small an amount of butter possible to save calories and only use the freshest seven grain bread I can find when making grilled cheese. My 9 month old will love this sandwich in a few weeks when I start giving them to her. This was a regular after school snack for me in high school. I sometimes would put a slice of turkey in there to be all warm and coated with melted cheese. Good with tomatoes too.

I have never really considered how to make a grilled cheese sandwich a "recipe", but I guess that I just assumed that eevryone knew how to make one! I didn't know that there was any other way to make grilled cheese. I have making them like this my whole life, learning from watching my mother. For those that mentioned the sandwich getting too brown before the cheese is melted - just turn the heat down to about medium low- the cheese will be nice and gooey and the outside toasted just right.

I used regular sliced cheese rather than processed. Turned out very well. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft / cheesy in the middle.

I love these sandwiches! I like to experiment with different types of bread and cheese. You've got to try it with rye caraway bread or egg bread, it's the best! It's also yummy if you put some cooked bacon between the two cheese slices.

This is THE sandwich of my childhood!  Excellent, but IMO even better with a little mayo. added to the sandwich b/f grilling.

A favorite from almost everyone's childhood.  Even better with a slice of bologna!
