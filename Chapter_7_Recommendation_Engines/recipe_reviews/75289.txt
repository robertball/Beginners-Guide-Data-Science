I can't even rate how this tastes, because we ended up eating a salad of plain spincach with toasted pine nuts, blue cheese, and Ranch dressing.  The dressing was going fine until I added the remaining dressing to the pan, where it promptly separated and turned into one big, disgusting, gloppy mess.  (The heat was turned to low...)  It was unusable as salad dressing.  If one is going to make this, I don't recommend heating the remaining dressing, but just stirring the heated onion mixture into the room-temp mixture.  I am saving the onion mix to hopefully use on chicken or something.  The only thing I was able to use was the toasted pine nuts- those were wonderful.  I'm kind of upset about the whole thing because it was very time-consuming, and then it didn't work (and wasted my good olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and bacon).

Yummy. A bit more labor intensive than I imagined so I did some shortcuts -- used pre-cooked bacon pieces and heated up with a little bit of oil. Used a much smaller amount also and we more than enough bacon in the dressing. Used regular blue cheese instead of gorganzola but next time will up that amount slightly. Finally, I just put the onions in with the bacon and let it all cook together.

This sounded so yummy, BUT my husband and 2 guests didn't love it.  Made according to directions except cut back to 1/2 lb. bacon (still too much).  Overload on calories and time-consuming, I don't think I'll make this recipe again.  With some overhaul, I think the recipe has potential - using the same basic ingredients, cutting down on the measurements and lightening up on the dressing (2/3 C of olive oil is excessive).

Very good. I think I forgot the pine nuts but I added sauteed mushrooms. Will make again.

This is a simple yet flavorful salad. The next time I will use white balsamic vinegar for the sake of appearance. I wasn't fond of the darkness of the dressing.

So decadent and easy to make. We used spicy candied pecans instead of pine nuts for an added kick.

Preparation for the salad was a bit too involved for the end result.  It was a nice change from regular ho-hum salad but not as dazzling as I expected.

Delicious! I made afew changes though:

- After I made the dressing I heated that up in a sauce pan then spooned afew spoons over the leaves. I didn't use anywhere near as much as the recipe tell you to.

- After that I tossed on the bacon and uncooked onions.

Next time I think I'll cut right down on the oil as well, the dressing didnt like sticking to the leaves. But still an amazing recipe!

Was the best course of the meal.  Substituted sunflower seed for nuts due to allergy.
