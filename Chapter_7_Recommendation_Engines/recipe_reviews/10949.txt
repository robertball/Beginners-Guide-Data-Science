Delicious! Everyone loves them!! I just have a word of advice for those who are making them for the first time. You have to sort of help the cookies take their shape. When you are dropping them on the baking sheet, their will be a pointy tip on each cookie that will still be there once they are baked. Just take the bottom of a clean spoon and gently  press on the top of each cookie as soon as they come out of the oven. This will give the icing more of a surface to lay on.

I am an expert pumpkin bread maker, but never made pumpkin cookies until now. I was skeptical.. but am now a believer! Goodness! I might just like these MORE than pupkin bread! They are similar to little cakes. Just AMAZINGly moist. The only diff. was I also added about 1/2 tsp. allspice. I always bake on silicone treated baker's parchment paper. Turned out AMAZING! I got my icing to look like the picture by adding about 1 c. more powdered sugar.. and make the frosting first. It really needs to cool. I turned over my cookies and dipped the tops in the icing.. Trying to drizzle over the cookies was way too messy!

This is the most incredible soft cookie.  Sooo delicious, even better than pumpkin pie.  I pour the glaze into a squeeze bottle for ease and speed in glazing these little gems.  Then I just drizzle the glaze on top.  This recipe makes lots and lots of cookies.

These cookies are really good! These are like little iced cakes, similar to a little debbie treat. Very mild flavor, my teenager devoured these like there was no tommorrow, but I thought they could use a little more spice. A 15 oz can of pumpkin is 2 cups. For the icing I used dark brown sugar and cooked it until it looked like it was all dissolved (or melted). I added about 4 cups of powdered sugar and the glaze/frosting worked great (and I had plenty left). The cookies were good plain, but the icing really makes them so don't leave it off. This makes a LOT of cookies. I got 7 dozen. These stayed soft, moist, and cakelike for the several days they lasted here. Thanks for sharing this terrific cookie recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe
I and everyone else couldnt get enough.
The only thing i would suggest is add a little more pumpkin. 
These cookies baked for about 15 minutes in my oven instead of 10, and I split the recipe in half twice which baked about 15 cookies. These cookies are very soft and cake-like, but they are irresistable.

I also added some chocolate chips to half the batter, and the chocolate chips overwhelmed the taste of pumpkin. 

These cookies are a hit. Everyone LOVES the frosting.

These cookies are wonderful!  They just melt-in-your-mouth.  I kept the frosting warm as I was using it and just dipped the tops of the cookies in the frosting.  Kids love them too!

These cookies are very good and I too used a squeeze bottle to drizzle the icing. I used fresh pumpkin which tasted very good but the cookies spread a bit more than I would have liked so if you are using fresh pumpkin, I would add a bit more flour. Everyone loved these cookies!

wow. i made these for a party and LITERALLY had to hide them from my family so they wouldn't get eaten up! i used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon and i suggest drizzling the frosting over the cookies in a criss-cross pattern to get just the right amount of sweet.

These just came out of the oven -- they smell awesome and taste just as good.  I made my cookies with about 2 Tbs. of batter and they needed to cook for about 16 minutes.  The batter yielded about 5-1/2 dozen cookies (but I'm not complaining!).

I cut this recipe in half and still got 4 dozen cookies.  I used butter instead and shortening (my personal preference) and a full teaspoon of cinnamon for a half recipe.  I also decreased the amount of milk in the icing to 2 tablespoons for a half recipe so it was spreadable instead of a glaze.   Since I made the icing first and was waiting for the cookies to cool before I iced them, I had to add just a little bit more milk to soften the icing.  These cookies are dangerously good!!

My first attempt at making pumpkin cookies and they were delicious!!  I was a little nervous when I was scooping the dough onto the cookie sheets - it's not your typical cookie dough batter.... but they baked up beautifully!  I used a medium-sized cookie scoop so the tops were smooth and the cookies were the perfect size.  I followed the cookie recipe exactly as written and we loved them.  As soon as the cookies came out of the oven, I pressed the tops of the cookies down with a spatula so they had more "flat" tops.  Then I added an extra 1 cup of powdered sugar to the frosting (I like a thicker frosting rather than a glaze) and, using a small spoon, I scooped a dollop and swirled it around on the top.  Because the frosting was still a touch warm, it spread a little and dried smooth over the cookie.   I also tried freezing these cookies - they don't take long to defrost and they are just as tasty!  Awesome recipe, thanks!!  UPDATE 9/21/12 - In addition to the cinnamon, I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the last batch I made and they were even BETTER!    It really enhanced the pumpkin... I will make it this way from now on!  I get about 5 to 5 1/2 dozen cookies from this recipe.  Oh and DON'T skimp on the pumpkin!  One 15 oz can is only equal to about 1 1/2 cups... it is definitely worth opening another can of pumpkin to get the extra 1/2 cup!

I haven't been on here to check my recipe in forever!! They have changed the recipe somewhat. I too use pumpkin pie spice, the brand I can't mention but they sell kitchen tools;), then I use a medium cookie scoop for the dough. I then bake them for about 15 minutes, but I use a baking stone, and the next set of cookies will bake for a shorter time. I also put the frosting in a glass bowl with a pouring spout. I can then "nuke" the frosting to keep it soft for pouring! For those who didn't have success, SORRY, but these are the easiest and most consistant cookies I make! Unlike my choc. chip cookies!! LOL

Very good cookie!  To save some fat, I used 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup of applesauce in place of the 2 cups of shortening.  They turned out amazing - my cookies turned out looking like the kaspmary picture.  Only other thing I did, based upon other reviews, was use 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, but felt they were still a little too bland for me, so I also added about 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Dipping the cookies in the icing worked out great.  I cooked mine for 16 minutes at 350. I used a medium-sized cookie scoop.  Definitely smooth the "sticky-uppy" parts after the dough is on the cookie sheet (I used insulated cookie sheets, too). Perfect!

I substituted butter for the shortening and took them out of the oven when they still looked a little underdone.  Amazing! They freeze really well, too.

I just made these! they melt in my mouth like nothing I have ever made. I added extra cinnamon, and some ginger and cloves. Also, I used half shortening and half butter. I also added some shortening and ginger and cinnamon to the frosting. I highly recommend these! on my way to eat my third and possibly fourth!! ** update!  I found out today that if you add a little extra flour you can roll the cookies out in balls and the tops will stay smoother :) This was my best batch!  I didn't use the shortening in the frosting this time and it stayed nice and soft.  YAY for these cookies!

Excellent cookie!  Didn't deviate at all from the recipe, but did follow advice to "flatten" the cookie out of the oven to make the frosting process easier.  The cookies were very moist and "cakey" and got the sweetness from the icing. Will definitely make these again!  Thank you Peggy!

I took this exact recipe and put it into a 9x13 cake pan.  I served it with "Pumpkin Bar Icing" from allrecipes.com (where I used Maple extract instead of Vanilla extract) for my Dad's birthday party.  It was like the cake version of a Maple bar.  This amazingly seasonal flavor combination was heavenly perfection!

Very good. Used handheld mixer to cream shortening and pumpkin mixture togather - much easier than by hand. Also added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice, ginger, nutmeg and cloves to batter. Tasted like "pumpkin pie" cookies! The icing is wonderful too, GREAT flavor. Overall, very satisfied.

I should have known when the recipe called for shortening and not butter that these would not be the tastiest cookies.  They were blah, and without the frosting they would have been almost inedible.  I made a big batch to take for thanksgiving, and wound up leaving them home they were so bad.

Wonderful, soft cookies.  Not too sweet and nice delicate flavor.  I followed the recipe for the cookie exactly, but the directions are a little vague on how big to make them, so I used about 2 heaping tablespoons of dough per cookie, placed them an inch apart, and that makes about a 2 1/2 inch cookie.  I got about 5 dozen cookies out of a batch using those amounts.  They don't spread much, but I did take another reviewer's suggestion to smooth the dough down with the back of a spoon (dip it in powdered sugar to keep it from sticking to the dough).  Mine also took longer to bake than the 10 minute recommended time, but because they are so cake-like, you can tell they are done if the cookie springs back when you touch it, just like a cake.  I didn't want to spend the time cooking and cooling the icing, so I mixed 4 T melted butter, 2 T milk, & 1 teas. maple extract together and then whisked in enough powdered sugar to make a thick icing.  Really good.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  I'll be making these for Thanksgiving.

This cookie was AMAZING!!  They were gone at work before the work day even started!  Everyone loved them!  I followed others advice and baked them for 20 minutes.  I used an ice cream scooper to drop onto cookie sheet.  That was perfect time! These cookies don't spread so however they go on the cookie sheet is how they will look when done. I also added pumkin spice and a little nutmeg.  I too added more confectioners sugar for the frosting icing and spooned it to the top of the cookie and it would drizzle down the sides.  For a couple, I did two coats of the icing.  I'd probably do that for all of them next time.  The only other thing I used differently was the crisco butter flavored shortening.  I use that for all of my cookie batters and it makes them SO light and fluffy.  These cookies were very moist!  I WILL make them over and over again!

Save this recipe if only for the icing- it's delicious. A bit runny as-is, so add the milk gradually.

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I gave them only 4 out of 5 for a few reasons.  1.  The icing is too runny for my liking, it was so tasty and I couldn't get enough on the cookies, and 2.  I think the cookies themselves could use a bit more spice.  Next time I make them I will follow the advice of prior reviews that say to add more powdered sugar to the icing to make it thicker and to depress the cookie with a spoon immediately after you pull them out of the oven so that you can make a sort of resevoir for the icing.  Also, next time I am going to try adding some pumpkin pie spice.  These are more like little cakes, but I loved it, they are SO moist.  The icing is to die for, it reminds me of maple icing on doughnuts.  Great recipe!

Tried this recipe 'as is' the first time, and they were not cookies at all. The photo shown is deceiving. Cake-like, as the recipe, yes. Cookies, absolutely not. Call them what they are: Individual cakes. In its raw state, it looks like cake batter and nothing like cookie dough, so it was no surprise when the first batch of "cookies" were runny, intersecting each other on the tray even though I put 2-3 inches between them. The second batch, I added an extra half cup of flour, refrigerated the dough and used a cookie scoop to help them hold a uniform shape. Nope. Still cake. At this point, I just put it in a cake pan and called it a day. Frosting is absolutely wonderful!

When I read the reviews, I just had to make these cookies. I used 1 cup of wheat flour & 1 cup of white flour. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 tsp gropund cloves. I like a lil more flavor. I really liked the icing. I thought how would cream cheese icing be, so, I made some and tried that and it turned out grest!

The taste was very nice, however I followed the recipes as it instructed and the cookies were no where near being done. I had to leave them in an additional 7-10 minutes and found that when they finally start to puff, they are about 3/4 the way baked. I really upset my evening having to learn these leassons the HARD way!!!!!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year and they were very very good!  Instead of icing, I just added a bag of white chocolate chips.  However, as much as I liked those with chips, I also loved the couple of plain ones that I made at the end.  I used a 2T scoop to measure out the cookies and next time I would use a smaller one.  It made big domed cookies that were beautiful but it was tricky getting them done enough in the middle since they didn't really spread.  For spice, I added 2 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg and 1/4 t cloves.  That made a mildly spiced cookie.  Next time I might add another t of cinnamon.  (I'm sure ginger would be great, but I can't eat it.)  Oh, almost forgot, I also used 1 1/2 sticks of butter  and 1/2 c applesauce rather than shortening.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, Peggy!

Sorry, these are the worst Pumpkin Cookies that I have ever had.  There is no taste to them at all.  I followed the recipe exactly also.  Waste of ingredients.

It's a good idea to make the frosting first, so that it has time to cool. I use a disher to portion out the cookies and they stay perfectly round. They are so light and delicious! Kind of like a little pumpkin cake. The frosting is great. I also use it on other desserts, like pound cake.

This are by far my new FAVORITE cookie !!!!  The batter came out thicker than I expected - so I found it easier to use my hands to place into balls on the tray.  I also found that putting the cookies on wire racks (with newspaper underneath) and then drizzling the icing saved on alot of clean up !  Also - per other recommendations - I added 1 c of confectioner's sugar to the icing (making it 3 c total).

I'll admit when I first saw this recipe I was extremely suspicious of a pumpkin cookie that didn't have chocolate chips in it.  How could such a thing exist?!?!  But it had good reviews so I thought I would give it a shot.  I'm a believer!  This is the best pumpkin cookie I have ever had and every single person who has tried them has asked for the recipe.  I only made small changes.  I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp ground cloves.  I have started replacing 1 cup of the shortening with 1 cup of the Smart Balance 50/50 Blend.  This makes it a tiny bit more healthy without sacrificing the integrity of the cookie.  I've started following the advice of one reviewer and making the frosting first so I don't have to wait all day for it to thicken.  Also, I haven't found the 10 minute bake time to be accurate, I usually do 12-15 minutes depending on the size of cookie.  They are still beautifully soft and cake-like.  Give these cookies a chance,  you won't be sorry!

These cookies are amazing! However, I did have a pretty big issue while making these.  Apparently, in my part of the country, there is a "pumpkin shortage" and I could not find canned pumpkin to save my life. I was baking these for my brother who LOVES pumpkin cookies. SO I decided to try using a 16 ounce jar of cinnamon applesauce instead of the 2 cups canned pumpkin. It looked scary at first! Kind of like biscuts... But when finished and topped with the caramel icing, I was amazed!!! Applesauce was a great substitute! I will say that the presentation of the cookie isn't very pretty, but it was super yummy! Give it a try!  Other changes made: 2 cups splenda for white sugar and Splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar!

These are impossible to resist once you have tasted one.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and added pumpkin spice, and I dipped the cookies in the icing. My husband said they HAD to be the best thing at the bake sale. The icing is to die for. Reminds me of maple sugar candy. I'm going to make another batch to share on Thanksgiving, but my waist line is begging me not to do it.

I used half shortening and half butter.  I also added nutmeg, ginger, cloves and vanilla to the cookie recipe. I would call these mini pumpkin cakes.  I had to bake them longer than 10 minutes. I baked them at 375 for 13 minutes.  I also added a tsp cinnamon to the icing recipe.  Cookies came out wonderful. I got 8 and 1/2 dozen cookies using a cookie scoop.  This one is a keeper.

I changed it a bit to fit what I had on hand...butter instead of shortening and I added nutmeg and ginger...think I need to add cloves next time too.  And I didn't have confectioners sugar, so no frosting...but they were great anyway.  Everyone loves them, even my dog is stretching to lick up the batter off the floor.

The cookies were really easy to assemble and tasted good. I used a 1/4 measuring cup to scoop and flatten the cookies. I dipped the tops of the cooled cookies in the caramel glaze and then topped with fall colored sprinkles.

I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I still think it wasn't enough spice.  I think next time 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  My other comment follows what many others have said: this makes WAY more than 3 dozen cookies.  I was a tad concerned when I saw "4 cups of flour" but thought, "oh well".  I should've known!  I used only about 2/3 the batter last night, but baked 30 large (dropped from heavily-rounded tablespoons) cookies.  On the other hand, the icing made only enough to ice the 30 cookies I had.  So when I bake the rest of the batter, I'll have to whip up another batch of icing.  Oh, I found 15 minutes the ideal baking time for my cookies.  Other than these comments, I really, really liked the cookies and will try them again, perhaps with a reduction in fat (replace some of the butter with applesauce).

These cookies taste delicious, although they need to be cooked for almost 20 minutes rather than 10.  They are very cakey and wonderful when warm.

I used pumpkin pie spice rather than cinnamon and opted to use carmel chocolate chips instead of the icing.  Yum!

The dough is very sticky and rather hard to work with - also, it doesn't hold in chocolate chips very well, as someone had mentioned earlier.

Fantastic soft cookie with icing that sets up perfectly.  I flash froze the cookies once the icing was on them.  I served some, sent some to my college son and froze the remainder.  I was worried what the frosting would do when they thawed, but it remained nice and smooth.  I will be making this recipe again.

these cookies are amazing!! I've made them twice so far, and everyone loves them.  I wasn't able to get the icing to turn out, so I used an icing recipe off another pumpkin cookie recipe.  But truthfully, I prefer these cookies without icing.  Problem is you can eat way too many of them!!  Made 80 the first time and 100 the second time.

This is a great recipe. My picky kids loved it, so I ill make this again.   What I did was half the recipe since I only had one can of pumpkin. (I should have added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar to the mix since I halfed the recipe--I only used one cup).  I added extra cinnamon, allspice and vanilla extract to the cookies and the icing and it came out great. But, the allspice makes a great difference in taste. YUMMY!

I made this recipe as listed, with the addition of a bit of allspice. I didn't like the cookies, though others who tried them seemed to enjoy them. Maybe they were just being nice?  First, I had trouble getting these cookies baked enough to set. (Perhaps I should have used a teaspoon to drop the cookies and not a tablespoon.) The first two batches were still gooey when cooled. Increasing the baking time to 16 minutes at least made the cookie hold its shape, though I still had to be careful with them. The result looked nice, but the mouth-feel was overy oily and the taste was much too sweet. I won't make these again; they weren't worth the calories.

These are great cookies!  They are super soft and freeze really well!! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening in my cookies.  Also, I made my frosting a little thicker by adding extra powdered sugar so that it would be more of a frosting rather than a glaze.  REALLY yummy recipe!!!!

I made these for a pumpkin carving party.  I cut the recipe in half and used butter instead of shortening (Ended up only using 3/4 a cup of butter although I should have used 1 C).  I had way more frosting than I needed.  Maybe I wasn't generous enough in dipping the cookies, but the frosting is super sweet.

Love these cookies! I add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg to the batter. When I bring them to work someone always asks me for the recipe. For me it makes about 5 dozen cookies.

These were wonderful! A big hit with the other moms at my kids school. some of them did not like pumpkin but thought these were great!I was told to make these cookies for a fundraiser this Saturday! I had to leave some at home for my kids to snack on and they were gone like THAT! I didn't make any changes to this recipe. I did pat down the tops of the cookies with a spoon like one reviewer had noted.  AMAZING RECIPE!!

So good!  I only added 1/2 tsp allspice to the cookies.  Baked 2 cookie sheets at a time for 13 min was perfect.  I did use parchment paper.  The icing was the best!  I did cool it for about 45 min, but after dipping them, the icing was a little runny, so next time I will add more powdered sugar and see if that helps.  Thanks for a winner!

SOOOO GOOOD after a small tweak!!! I brought them in for a work Christmas party and everybody raved about them! I made these almost exactly as written but I added some nutmeg and allspice and a little pumpkin pie spice.  I can see how they would be bland without more spices. With these changes I'd give them 5 stars. I think next time I make them, though, I will refrigerate the dough and then use an ice cream scoop to drop them, so they are uniform in size and shape. Oh and I did follow another reviewer's suggestion of patting them down with the back of a spoon right when they come out of the oven. This makes a nice surface for the frosting to adhere to :)

It was hard to rate this. I absolutely love pumpkin cookies (added a little more cinnamon then called for). The cookie recipe is good. But, the icing just did not come out well. And I found it just too sweet. I bet the cookies would taste yummy with some nuts in it...

These were fabulous!!! and what's even better is that they work well with substitutions for those who have food allergies.  I substituted gluten free flour mix for the all purpose flour( I use 2 cups brown rice flour, 1 and 1/2 cups potato starch, and 1/2 cup tapioca starch), for the two eggs I substitute 4 Tbs. sweet potato baby food ( I know, weird, but it works great!), and I used Spectrum non-hydrogenated shortening.  they turned out absolutely delicious.  I haven't even put the frosting on them yet, and they're great :)  thanks for the great recipe!!

These cookies are AWESOME. I made them for work and everyone loved them and several people requested the recipe.  I did make some minor changes. I added some nutmeg and ground cloves and also added vanilla to the cookie.  The recipe made about 5-6 dozen, so I don't know if I made them smaller than I was suppose to or what happened.  I also had to bake them 13 minutes for them to be done.  I did not notice the cookies should be frosted warm, so mine were not.  I did use the tip from other reviewers to turn them upside down and dip them in frosting.  This worked well for me.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it is a keeper!

Loved these cookies. My husband wanted half iced and the other half not iced because he loved the cookie on its own. These were a huge hit at my house!!

I usually don't give recipes 5 stars if I don't follow the recipe exactly.  This recipe deserves it!  Here's what I did:  I used 2 cups of butter instead of shortening, I used a 16oz. can of sweet potatoes and mashed them, and added an extra egg, I also didn't have the ingredients to frost them.  These turned out great!  Light, fluffy and just the perfect amount of cinnamon.  These are definitely a keeper!  I may sneak them in at our Thanksgiving dessert table!  Try these you won't be disappointed!

Excellent Recipe.  I too baked for 15 min.  Also increased the cinnamon to 2 t. and added a SMALL pinch of nutmeg and a SMALL pinch of ground cloves.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Brought to work and got RAVE reviews.  It's only 8:30 in the morning and 3 people have already asked for the recipe.  Thanks again.

These came out beautiful!  Like other reviewers suggested, I also baked these for 15 minutes, which was perfect.  This recipe did make a lot of cookies (about 3 1/2 dozen.  Also, make absolutely sure you shape them how you want them before you put them into the oven, as these cookies do not spread at all.  I made a few minor adjustments...I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening, and I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  If you are going to be storing these in a container, they will stick together, so be sure to use wax paper to seperate them.  They do best left out on the counter uncovered.  The pumpkin keeps them from drying out.  Lastly, I got creative with the spices and used cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and cloves. I will definately be making this recipe many more times.  It's a keeper!

These cookies are very soft -- more like a cake than a cookie. I used only 6 tbsp of milk and the icing was still too runny.

I've made this recipe a few times, and I only have one problem with the cookies - I can't stop eating them! The recipe calls for two cups of shortening, but the first two times I used half a cup, and last night I made it with half a cup of shortening and half a cup of butter. I can't see how they possibly need two cups - so if you're worried they won't be light and fluffy with less, don't worry about it! The icing is runny, but that's how it's supposed to be. Drizzle it over the cookies on a cooking rack with parchment or waxed paper underneath, it dries on to yummy goodness.

These were ok.  They weren't the flavor that I was expecting.  I expected a strong pumpkin flavor, with a hint of spiciness.  
I did make one tiny change - I used rum extract instead of vanilla in the frosting.  The frosting is the best part. :)
Overall, I will probably make these again, the cookies are moist and they taste good, the flavor is just more subtle than I expected.  I wouldn't say they are anything to write home about, but they aren't bad either.
Also, I should've taken the advice of others who said to bake them 12 minutes instead of 10.  They could definitely use the extra minute or two.  (I had assumed that it was more of an oven variation thing than an actual necessity.  Normally my oven burns things if they aren't being watched very very carefully.  I almost always have to pull stuff out a minute or two early.)

These cookies are AWESOMEE and are now one of my top favorites!!! My siblings and I could not get enough. When I first started making them I was skeptical..I never used so much shortening before but I followed the recipe exactly as is and the end result was great. Definitely make the frosting before the cookies for it needs to cool or it will be runny and not look neat as in the picture. Will be making these again!

These are really small cakes. Think Little Debbies and Hostess (minus the horrible waxy coatings). They are soft and doughy and the icing is sinful. I ate the whole batch. I'd recommend making a very small dough ball if you want a cripser, more cookie like base. But as the recipe stands, it's delicious.

I set out to bake these cookies with much hesitation because I live in a country where canned pumpkin is not available so I was using fresh. (I have made fresh pumpkin cookies before that were disastrous - inedible even!) However, I had no need to worry because the results from this recipe were delightful! I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved them - they came out like mini-pumpkin cakes, just the right amount of sweetness and soft.

These were just ok - better than some others - but just ok.  The icing was difficult and the cookies were dry on the tounge even though they weren't actually dry.  Very weird texture.  I did like them better out of the fridge..... Probably will just stick to pumpkin pie for my pumpkin craving!

Love these cookies!  I was so excited that mine turned out just like the picture and fluffy (especially living in high altitude).  A bit flour tasting but like other reviews don't skip the frosting! I also dipped the cookies instead of drizzle.  Thanks so much for sharing this and will make every day its chilly :o)

I've played around with a couple pumpkin cookie recipes and this is by far the best. Nothing compares! They're always a big hit wherever I go. I've made them with shortening and with butter and either way seem to turn out great.

I added Ginger to this recipe as they seemed quite boring without.  I also had to deviate from the time and oven temp.  I had to bake them at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.  All said and done, they are not much different than a pumpkin bar even though they take much longer to make due to it being a cookie.  Next time, I will just make my infamous pumpkin bars.  I will say, however, that the frosting is great tasting!

These were really great.  I agree with previous posters that they are more of a cake than a cookie.  I marketed them as mini pumpkin cakes with caramel icing.  I used a small ice cream scoop, well floured,  to portion them out and that seemed to work really well.  If they come out a bit lumpy on the top I found that inverting them and dipping them in the icing resulted in a better overall surface coverage then spreading the icing on with a spoon or knife.  I've made quite a few pumpkin themed desserts and this is one of my favorites.

I recently made these pumpkin cookies for a cookie baking contest, and won!  1st place...a brand new, $300 KitchenAid mixer!  These cookies don't look too flashy once you have them frosted, but boy do they taste good!  They stay super mois and soft, almost like cake.  They're not overly pumpkiny or spicy, and the icing is a nice compliment.  I did flatten the tops of the dough down with the back of a wet spoon before baking.  I also think these would be excellent with cream cheese frosting!

Fabulous!!!  Soooo good.  Normally I do not like pumpkin cookies/bread etc because I am not a fan of clove/nutmeg/etc.  But these were AMAZING!  Just cinnamon is just perfect.  And the texture of these cookies is fantastic-cakey and soft.  The frosting is such a perfect sweet topping on these, delicious!!  The  only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening but that's  just personal ingredient preference.  I cut the recipes in half and they were  absolutely inhaled within 24 hrs!  Wish I had made the whole recipe.  I have already been asked to make them again and I will be making them for 2 different upcoming events.  Thank you, this is going in my permanent file!

These were delicious.  My husband couldn't stop eating the frosting.  I also liked them without the frosting because the pumpkin flavor came through. Used butter instead of shortening but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

As others said, you couldn't eat just one. I figured I would only keep a few home and take the rest to work but barely a sample made it into work. I had to leave them out on a plate because if I covered the cookies the icing got "melty." Despite that they were delicious!

This recipe was delicious!  My friends and family really enjoyed these cookies.  I altered the recipe a little by adding sugared walnuts.  I left my glaze warm and dipped my cookies into the warm glaze.  After they were dipped into the glaze, I instantly dipped them into a bowl of sugared walnuts.  To create sugared walnuts, I simply took 1 bag of copped walnuts and added 1/4 cup of sugar along with a 1 tsp of cinnamon and about 1/8 cup of brown sugar.  I then shook it all up in a bag and poured the sugared walnuts into a bowl.  I felt that this gave the cookie a little pizzazz as well as a nutty flavor that went well with the pumpkin and caramel.  This is a great dessert and my 4- year- old son had fun helping me with the glaze and walnuts!

These were delicious.  yes they were cake like and VERY soft but still good.  I love the icing.  I halved the recipe and had 3 dozen cookies.  I added some ginger and cloves to bring out the pumpkin in it.  I tasted the batter to get the right pumpkin taste I was looking for. I am making them again this weekend for some friends I work with.

Wow. These cookies are AMAZING. I was skeptical when I was spooning the dough out onto the cookie sheet. The dough had a texture unlike other cookies I have made, and the dough doesn't taste particularly good. I put the first batch in the oven and waited for them to cool before I gave them a try. They are sooooo good. They are like  teeny tiny pumpkin cakes. These are going in to my regular dessert rotation!!

I am not a fan of pumpkin, so I was making these for friends at bowling.  I thought 2 cups of shortening was a lot, but was worried about changing the texture/consistency too much.  So I substituted 1 cup of shortening for 1 cup of applesauce (unsweetened)....  Everyone LOVED them.  I found after adding the icing, that they even got softer.  Even though I had them sitting on the counter.  I actually really liked them as well, as they weren't too pumpkin'ee'.

These are really very good.  I don't prefer a cakey cookie, but every once in awhile I like them.  Not the type of cookie to eat a handful of with a tall glass of milk, but, one or two with a cup of coffee is quite satisfying.

These are amazing! Soft, cake-like cookies that melt in your mouth! The frosting is delicious - definitely do not omit it.  I increased the amount of pumpkin slightly because I like a strong pumpkin flavor, added a dash of nutmeg and ~1 tsp vanilla - everyone asked for the recipe!

Wonderful pumpkin flavor, delicious icing, and these kept for a long time . . . tasting even better the longer they sat!   I have tried several pumpkin cookie recipes on this site, and this is the one I've decided to make from now on.  Just the right amount of pumpkin flavor!!!  The only thing I changed was to add a 1/2 tsp each of ground nutmeg and ground cloves.  I'm sure they would taste great with or without chocolate chips, nuts, butterscotch chips, the caramel icing, or just a plain powdered sugar icing.  These will be making a regular appearance in my baking year round!

I just finished making these cookies. They shouldn't be called cookies, they should be called little cakes.  They were okay and I'm sure the next time I make them they will be great.  They definately need more spices.  I used 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp clove and a 1/4 tsp nutmeg.   Also the recipe says drop from spoon, but how big of a spoon.  I started with a tablespoon and my cookies look like biscuits.  Make sure you use rounded teaspoons that makes the perfect size.  Finally, you should add about 1/2 cup more confectioners sugar to get the perfect consistency for the frosting.  I will give these another try, but with my tweaking of the recipe.  Next time I hope to give it more stars.

These were awesome!  I used a small scoop to make these cookies and it probably made 10 dozen or so!  I added mini chocolate chips to half of the batter which came out great.  I too would cut the icing recipe in half as I had way too much, plus I only frosted about half of the cookies.  Everyone in my house loved them, which never happens.  Two thumbs up!!!

I thought these were super yummy! The cookie and icing combo is great. I made mine a bit healthier by replacing 2 cups of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the shortening with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I would cut the frosting down to half next time since I had a lot of it left over. This made 52 cookies for me.

These look so good in the photo that I had to make them tonight. I think I may have let my expectations get away from me...they were good but just not quite as good as I'd anticipated.  Followed recipe exactly, except baked each batch for about 16 minutes (yielded 4 dozen).

These were very good.  I followed suggestions and made the frosting first.  It also helps to take a spoon and make like a thumb print in the cookies when they come out of the oven to hold the frosting.  I will use pumpkin pie spice as well as cinnamon the next time for a stronger pumpkin flavor.

These were a big hit! I agree with Emily - cooking time was longer and the icing needed to be a little thicker. I will be making these alot in the future.

I just made these this morning with my 3-year old and they turned out great! It was hard to get him to stop eating them, especially once they were iced! I added a bit more icing sugar than called for and dipped the cookies into the icing and placed them on parchment paper. Time will tell how long these 90-some cookies last us!

VERY good cookies! I used a 2" scoop and baked for 18 minutes and they turned out beautiful! I took the advice of another reviewer and added another cup of powdered sugar to the very thin icing and dipped the tops of the cookies to reduce the mess.  I yielded 5 dozen cookies!

I will be making these again.  A tip..these cookies dont spread on their own so you need to use your fingers or a spoon to spread them out before cooking.  My first batch was cooked on the bottom and still batter on the top.  I just drizzled the frosting and it added just the right amount of sweetness.  I also added cloves and nutmeg as personal preference.  Everyone loved how light and moist they were.  I made a double batch, 116 cookies and they didnt last 24 hours. One more note, my oven usually bakes like the instructions state but my cookies needed at least 13 minutes to set up/  A great breakfast cookie also

Excellent cookie! The frosting is delish! The only thing I did differently was use pumpkin that I had pureed and frozen last fall, and I put the frosting in a squeeze bottle and just swirled on to the cookie. The neighbors loved the  cookies too!

Wonderful cookies! I used butter instead of shortening and they came out just fine. I also found it was easier to just dunk the tops of the cookies into the icing. My only change in the future would be to double the amount of cinnamon, because I love cinnamon!

This has to be the most dissapointing recipe I've ever made.  I was expecting great results based on all the rave reviews, but these cookies were tasteless, greasy, and leave a "Crisco" aftertaste.  I've been baking for years and this is one of the worst things I've ever made.  RUN AWAY from this recipe!

The icing is amazing, it was all I could do not to eat it with a spoon. The cookies themselves were, at best, mediocre, right out of the oven and later the same day. By the second day and on, however, wow! Like a fine wine, they aged beautifully with time! These were incredible and we all had to excercise extreme self control! These are really very good but I found I had to cook them for closer to 14 minutes. Thanks for this great treat!

Fabulous cookie! I reduced the sugar in the cookie portion by a half cup to suit the taste of my family.  I used a pumpkin spice mix instead of the cinnamon.  I also followed the advice of some reviewers and used a squirt bottle to put the icing on.  Okay, I have to leave the house now before I end up eating all of the cookies...very addicting.

My first two star rating. These had very little taste to them, despite adding extra cinnamon. It had a nice cake-like texture, but the shortening overwhelmed the taste of them. I wonder if subbing butter-flavored shortening or butter would be good. Overall, not a winner-won't try again.

These cookies were fantastic. Everyone loved them. The recipe is easy too read and they are so simple to make. I did use butter flavored shortening. This recipe makes ALOT of cookies. But the recipe is very very very easy to cut in half. Just half all the ingredients. 
Wonderful Wonderful!!!

These cookies are great and very moist.  I have made them two times.  The first time I baked them exactly as the recipe was written and the family really liked them.  The second time I made them, I added two to three big handfulls of dried cranberries (and still topped with the icing) and my family just loved them this way. We love anything pumpkin and I will be making these often.

Awesome! When they are fresh out of the oven, they taste just like cupcakes. Yum! I also used cream cheese icing (from a can) and sprinkled a bit of pumpkin pie spice on top. It added a little interest to the top, and added pumpkin pie flavor to the icing. SO good!

Oh my goodness this the best cookie ever! Only they are more like mini cakes. I followed the ingredients exactly but I had to bake them for about 12 minutes. Thay are so soft and amazingly good. I made them last night and thought they were a little too sweet but this morning my husband and I both found them amazing, it seems like thay taste better once the icing settles a bit. My husband calls them "the little crack cookies" because he is now addicted!!!

I'm a HUGE pumpkin fan and this is one of my top 3 favorite pumpkin recipes I have tried - and definitely the top cookie recipe.  I always have to make the biggest batch possible if I want to share with anyone since I eat so many of these!  I haven't yet tried the icing - I'm not a huge icing on cookies fan - but think I will the next time I try these.

These are a very moist cookie. I baked them for 15 minutes and that worked, but I made large cookies. The flavor of the glaze is great, but I thought it overpowered the flavor of the cookies. After the cookies and glaze were completely cooled, however, the flavor was perfect. I also had a lot of glaze left over when I was done so I double-topped the cookies as was suggstsed in another review.

I have forwarded this recipe to my sister who loves pumpkin cookies.

These were a hit!  I increased the baking time as another reviewer suggested.  I rolled them into balls and flattened out the top and they turned out wonderful.  I sprinkled red and green sugar on the icing and they were the perfect addition to Christmas cookie baskets.

These cookies are so yummy!  They take quite a while to make, and the recipe makes a TON of cookies, but they were gone in no time!  I used a 1/2 inch cookie scoop and it made 70 cookies.  They are small enough to pop in your mouth, and great for kids because they're not too sweet.  I found they taste best when refrigerated.

Sooooooo delicious! I could hardly keep my family’s hands off them to even allow them to cool..my husband doesn’t even like pumpkin and he loved these. The only changes I made was I used more pumpkin, less salt, I added a dash of cinnamon to the glaze on top and I drizzled them instead of covering completely. Perfection. Thank you for the recipe!

I added chocolate chips and these tasted a lot like the expensive ones I get at the grocery store. I'll increase the seasoning a bit the next batch. They are definitely one of my favorites now :)

This rating is for the caramel icing alone as I have not yet made the cookies but definitely will! The icing is truly AMAZING and I made it to drizzle over pumpkin bread. WOW is all I could say as it is perfection. I can't wait to make the icing with the pumpkin cookies!

This is a fall staple. I don't change a thing except make the icing a little thicker with a bit more powdered sugar. My family and customers love these and ask for them every year. Like others have mentioned, make sure you drop them "rounded" as they tend to retain the shape as they bake.

This has been a go to fall recipe for several years. Everyone who eats them loves them! I use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and double it to 3 teaspoons.  The secret to icing rather than a thinner glaze is truly cooling the milk and sugar mixture BEFORE you add any powdered sugar, it should feel cool to the touch. Set your pan in large bowl with an ice bath if you are in a hurry! Be careful not to slop water into the sugar mixture if you try this.

PERFECT RECIPE,  the only thing I can't comment on is the spice I always us more than a recipe calls for on cinnamon, in my world there's no such thing as too much cinnamon...only bad thing is: they are soooo good you want to share them except they are soooo good you want to save all of them for yourself...oh and i'll be using this glaze on other stuff, I added cinnamon to it too, also used the dunking method suggested by anoher user, worked like a charm

Just made these and they are great!!! Didn't have baking soda so I used 3 times the amount of baking powder, also added a little salt to the carmel icing. Took 15 minutes to bake. Second batch; I added bacon crumbles to the top :)

Was trying to find a pumpkin cookie recipe i loved years ago and these were it. Wonderful moist cookies, but I did add more spices (nutmeg, etc).  These are fantastic. I made over 5 dozen, but they didn't last more than a few days.
 Made the "Iced Pumpkin Cookies" rated at over 1000 reviews and they were OK.

Pretty good cookie. It's nice to have something a little different sometimes. The icing has more of a maple flavor than caramel. If I make again I will be definitely be adding some nutmeg, allspice, or something else to the cookie to give it some zing as it was a bit bland without the icing.

They were amazing!  I followed the recipe and add some chocolate chips to half the batch.  They were so moist.  I loved the frosting! Next time my husband wants me to try using some raisins and nutmeg seasoning.

I love these cookies! My mom and I made them every fall. For a differnt variety to them she would add chopped walnuts. I'm not a nut person but people who ate them with the walnuts absolutley loved them! Thanks for posting this recipe on here. Mom lost her recipe years ago and we couldn't find it anywhere and when I saw this recipe I knew this was the one!! Mom and I were able to make a bunch of these this year! Thanks!

This is a very good recipe. Its quite like the Ricotta Cookies I make every Christmas. I will be adding this to my Christmas Cookie list to be sure. I only made 2 changes. 1st I used 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of Baking powder. 2nd after I iced them, I added chopped walnuts. YUM YUM YUM! They're already great but the walnuts take them over the top! And they look even prettier. Thanks for a great recipe Peggy!

I don't know if it is my taste buds or if I did something wrong, even though I followed the recipe as is except for adding a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  To me they lacked lots of flavor when fresh from the oven, even with the icing.  I took them to a friend's for dinner and was rather embarrassed because they were not AMAZING like all the rave reviews I read.  However, the next day they flavor seemed to have blossomed quite a bit and they were good. By the third day they were still tasty, but getting soggy.  The recipe makes lots and lots of cookies, if you are not baking for a small army then cut it in half.

These were good, but I gave only three stars because these were more cake-like than cookie-like. The frosting on top was good, but too watery. I should have let it thicken before frosting so that it looked better on top.

Nice and light cookies, but next time I'll add more spices to give them a bit more flavour.  Also, I used butter instead of shortening.  I got about 5 doz. our of one batch - bonus.

these cookies literally MELT in your mouth. I tweeked them with extra cinn, ginger and nutmeg because I like my cookies a little spicier - -but the br sugar glaze was MMMMMM wonderful. They are by far the best in texture cookie I have found.

I didn't care for these cookies. They didn't have enough flavor and the texture was too cake like for me. I cooled the frosting in the fridge for approx. 20 mins before spreading on the cookies - worked good.

Refrigerate the shortening!  Seriously, these are absolutely delicious cookies, but the second time I made them I used unopened shortening from the pantry and they flattened like pancakes.  I felt like a ridiculous newbie for making the mistake.  Still tasted good, though. I did read the other reviews and upped the spice factor.  I used 1 Tbs cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves and a pinch of ginger. Also, instead of going through the icing trouble, I made a plain glaze with powdered sugar and milk and dipped the tops in, then made a spiced glaze with powdered sugar, the aforementioned spices, and milk, and drizzled it on top.  Taste was phenomenal and it was a pretty presentation as well.  Thanks for this recipe, it's an instant favorite.

Took these to a party and they were a big hit.  More cake-like than cookie but absolutely delicious!  I added chocolate chips to half the batch and that was fantastic!  No icing needed on those.  Next time I make them I will add more spice (pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, etc.).

I have been making these cookies for over 2 years now. The recipe is perfect! They are always a hit when I make them and my mom even started making them along with all her other cookies she makes for the holidays! Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are awesome! I brought them to work and got rave reviews! everyone loved them. The only thing I need to recommend is to keep them about 5 minutes longer in the oven. First batch was not cooked. the cookies fell apart. Second batch after about 15 mins in the oven, were perfect!

AMAZING! I took the advice and used half butter and half shortening, and they came out great! I only frosted half of the batch because they taste amazing with out without frosting! This recipe is my new favorite!

Exceptional taste- very moist and not too sweet on their own. I used a regular glaze instead of the caramel icing. I also substituted butter for shortening and added 2tsps of pumpkin pie spice.   For flat cookies that are easier to glaze/frost, I floured the bottom of a drinking glass and gently pushed down after spooning the batter on the cookie sheet.  Really delicious!

Excellent!  As suggested by another reviewer the cookies definitely need a little help with shaping (just push the peaks in).  Light on the spice which most children like.  I'd add more cinnamom next time.  The glaze is outstanding.  It's not frosting (light and fluffy) so don't think it's runny when you make it.  Takes at least 12 hours to set up.  My entire family loved them.  From my husband to my 3 year old nephew.

Easy to make. Came out so soft and moist. I added chocolate chips to half of the batter  for my dad and sister because they like their cookies sweet.

Wonderful cookies.  I put a maple frosting just like you get on maple bars on these cookies and they were to die for.  They are soft and round and just perfect for a big dab of maple frosting.  Definitely a fall/Halloween cookie I will make every year.

The cookies were nice and soft and the receipe yields three dozen HUGE cookies .  I felt the batter didn't have enough pumpkin flavor so I doubled the amount of pumpkin... so they turned out kind of bland, the icing was nice and accompanied well though.  I think next time I will play around with different spices to help add flavor.

Tasty!  Works pretty well at altitude.  Added 1/2t. Allspice.  Frosting drizzles more than spreads.  Makes a lot, only need to do half a batch.

I made these cookies last week and they turned out great! I baked for 12 min and they were perfect. I took the suggestions of others and after dropping by scoopful I dipped a glass in sugar and lightly *smooshed* them down for even baking. The glaze was a very nice and yummy addition. My only complaint is that I think they need more pumpkin and more spices to kick them up a notch. The cookie itself baked up wonderfully soft and moist but if not for the glaze, I kind of found the flavor to be a bit on the boring side, sorry. I think I'll keep looking for another Pumpkin cookie recipe.

I added cloves and all-spice to give it more flavor, but over-all a great recipe. Also the frosting can not be drizzle, so I just took the cookies and dunked the tops in frosting and it worked out great.

These are very good and pretty easy to make. It's interesting because the cookie by itself tastes bland and the icing by itself is very sweet but together the flavors balance each other out to make a perfectly delicious cookie. They have a nice texture which is light and cakey.  The mixture will be light and fluffy (not like usual cookie dough) but don't worry, that's the way it is.

These cookies were such at hit, and this batch makes several dozen, enough to give away.  I recommend not stacking these cookies because they can get smushed easy and the icing gets icky that way. Also they can be out on the counter because they are so moist, and won't dry out! Man these cookies are to die for!

These are a hit with the family.   I did add 1 bag semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 c chopped  walnuts.  Also, I baked them 13 minutes.  I also doubled the cinnamon.

These cookies are AWESOME!  I read a lot of reviews before baking and I made 2 simple alterations:  1 29 oz. can of pumpkn (Yes, I used ALL of the big can!), and LOTS of spices: 2 tsp. Saigon Cinnamon, 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I made the frosting (let it cool before adding powdered sugar) and put it in a zip-loc bag, snipped the corner off and ribboned it on.  Everyone wants the recipe: my students, their parents, and my husband's co-workers! You can not go wrong here! Thanks so much for a delicious, festive treat!

I don't know what went wrong. These cookies turned into a gooey mess. It was the first time I made cookies with a frosting so I must've done something wrong. On the other hand I used the rest of the mix to make a bunt cake and it was delicious. I somehow made it too cake like but it did turn out delicious with the frosting.

These were delicious and a nice change from the traditional 'pumpkin pie.' Used butter instead of shortening and cut recipe in half (still makes ALOT of cookies) Used half brown sugar and half white.  Put a bit more pumpkin and cinnamon that asked for. Also, added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin spice--Will make again!

The flavor of these was fantastic -- the only changes I made were to add a half-teaspoon each of ginger and nutmeg.  My only deductions are on style points, since I like to bring desserts into work, and these were arguably the ugliest cookies I've ever made (you would definitely need a lot more confectioners' sugar in the frosting for them to look like the prettier pictures), and they were difficult to transport/store (can't really stack them) and eat in their sticky softness.  But my coworkers still loved them!

These melt in your mouth cookies were yummy.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I thought they needed more spice in them. The frosting was a perfect complement to the cookies.

These cookies were such a hit at my pot luck party.  Yes, they do have a ton of shortening but that's what makes them so good!  I do suggest making sure they are in a little ball before you put them in the oven or else you'll get pumpkin pancakes.  Also, the frosting will be a little gooey but it will harden in a few minutes.

I have made these twice now! My husband took them to work and they got great reviews. However, I may consider trying to make the icing without the brown sugar next time. Lots of extra added calories! Also, LET THE ICING COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE ADDING THE POWDERED SUGAR! The first time I made them, I did not and I had a ton of left over frosting. The second time, it cooled for probably 45 minutes before I added the powdered sugar. I had reduced the recipe by half (based on first experience) and the icing sat up much nicer and thicker - like the picture! I ran out of icing halfway through and at that point was rushed and didn't let it cool nearly as long when I whipped up more. The icing separated and looked lumpy. Taste was still good, but the appearance was not there!

These cookies were moist and quite delicious!! I also took the tip by another reviewer, who mentioned to lightly press the tops of the cookies when it just comes out of the oven. A few tips that were not mentioned in the recipe that could be questioned: No need to grease the pan. With a covection oven, cook at 350 for 14 minutes with insulated cookie sheets, and 10-11 with dark cookie sheets. Use a teaspoon (not tablespoon). Overall, very delicious cookies!

These cookies were amazing! They were so moist and soft, everyone loved them. My only comment is make sure the brown sugar, butter and milk is completely cooled before you mix in the powdered sugar and wisk in the powdered sugar so there are no lumps. Also it makes like 5 dozen which was a good surprise!

These cookies were delicious! I do not even like pumpkin flavored desserts and I really enjoyed these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly except the cookies take about 16 minutes to cook rather than 10. These would be good to make for Thanksgiving or a holiday party!

I made these for my Mothers 60th birthday party and everyone was raving about them! I had to copy the recipe for people and everyone wanted to bring some home with them. My husband who claims he doesn't like pumpkin says he loves them and already wants me to make more. I will be making lots more of these cookies! Thanks for sharing!

Deliciously moist and cake-like. I added dashes of pumpkin spice, ground nutmeg and ground ginger for more spice. I used 1 c shortnening and 1 c butter (ran out of shortnening) and it was great! Used a melon scooper to get the perfect amount of batter into each cookie and cooked about 15 minutes. I used more pwd. sugar in the glaze for thickness and dipped the tops face-down for an even consistency. Will make again for sure!

Made these twice now in a week.  Both times everyone loved them at work. (and at home too)  Followed as written adding only a little pumpkin pie spice.  If you want to make it a little easier, put the glaze frosting in a bottle and drizzle it over the cookies.  Makes a lot of cookies, about 7 dozen each time.  Try them, I promise you'll love them.

Almost perfect!  I made as the recipe states, except added 1/4 tsp of allspice to the dough and an extra cup of powdered sugar to the frosting.  As others have mentioned, I would also recommend gently pressing the dough down before popping them in the oven.  I baked them for 14 minutes, rotating the trays half way through.  The texture was delicious and the frosting was a keeper, but the cookie part needed more spice in my opinion.  I found it easiest to frost the cookies by dipping the cookies upside down in slightly warm frosting.  Will make again but doctor up with more spice.

These were great! I let the frosting cool in the fridge while all the cookies were baking. After the cookies cooled I twisted them upside down in the the frosting. This was a lot cleaner way to do it, but worked better with smaller cookies since big ones tended to break this way. They were a big hit among my friends. Note to self: made about 9 dozen 2 inch cookies when following recipe as is.

Really good and moist. Made them with the icing, but would suggest waiting letting the icing thicken (cool) before putting them on a cooled cookie.

This recipe is worthy of 5 stars with the following changes:  The icing made them too messy, so I left it off.  I added 1 cup of dried cranberries to the batter for color, texture and nutrition.  Before baking, I topped each cookie with a sprinkle of coarse granulated sugar (decorator style) and a pecan half.  I also baked them a few minutes longer than the recipe stated.  Now they are 5-star quality.

4 stars simply because the taste was outstanding.  I am sure the reason they didn't come out right has to do with children who take off with my measuring cups.  I think I used too much shortening.  The frosting also did not set up right...not even a good consistency for a glaze.  Anyway, I will try again, with the proper measuring tools, and see if I can get it right!

I made these exactly as written and thought they were wonderful.  I can't imagine why so many people needed to alter this recipe to get it to work. The baking time was nearly perfect and the icing recipe seemed perfect as well.  I did get nearly 100 cookies from my batch without increasing the recipe.

In spite of some changes I made, these turned out wonderfully! I wanted to try this recipe but had no pumpkin. I used two medium sweet potatoes for two cups of mashed pulp. I also used self rising flour instead of the flour salt and soda. Baked them on parchment for 20 minutes and used the wonderful brown sugar glaze.Added some Mexican vanilla with the potatoes. A five star chef friend who tried them loved them! My son in law who doesn't like sweet potaotoes loved them. My daughter said they tasted like the best scones you could buy anywhere. Thank you so much for the tasty recipe. I may try it with pumpkin now.

So good!  I followed the recipe (with the exception of replacing 1/2 cup of the shortening with no sugar added applesauce) and the results are amazing!  I did half of them with the caramel icing and mixed semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter for the other half.   Like having your own personal pumpkin cake.  :)  I'll totally be making these again.

Every Friday I volunteer with a group of kids, and we cook and bake.  This recipe, although delicious and the kids absolutely LOVED them, is not kid-friendly to make. Creaming that first part of the batter is a bit difficult and we still had gobs of shortening not fully mixed in, but they still turned out very well, and once the flour was in, everything was fine. The icing was a little strong for my taste, but not bad. I would definitely make these again with the same batter, but with a different icing. (When you make these cookies, realize that it's for 18 people, not just 18 cookies.  We made around 50 cookies.)

Delicious! I added a little more sugar and cinnamon and had to cook them much longer than the recipe called for, but maybe that's just the difference in ovens. I will definitely make them again and maybe try putting all spice in it! Yum!

These cookies are INCREDIBLE!  So soft and fluffy, and the icing is such a nice sweet touch.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added an extra cup of confectioner's sugar to the icing, and I also had to bake the cookies for 20 minutes instead of 10.  One helpful tip is that 8 tablespoons = 1/2 cup, for the milk in the icing.  Makes measuring a little easier! :)  Thanks Peggy Ackerman for a great recipe!

These are so good, my new favorite cookie!  I almost think they tasted better the next day as the flavor of the spices had a chance to soak into the dough.  I can't wait to do this recipe again throughout the fall season. I made this recipe as is and didn't/wouldn't change a thing!

These were just "so-so" for me...taste is ok, very similar to pumpkin pie (I added some traditional spices). This makes a lot! I would say at least 4 dozen. Takes much longer baking time too---I would say 15-16 minutes per sheet, at least! Probably will not be one of my regular recipes...

WOW! Very yummy and easy to half the recipe (although now I wish I hadn't!) I used freshly roasted pumpkin from my garden and added some cinnamon to the frosting (my son's suggestion) and they were absolutely delicious. Kind of tastes like the pumpkin scones from Starbucks, but more moist and flakey. Spooned the warm frosting over the tops of warm cookies with no problem. Dunking them sometimes resulted in broken cookies since they were so moist and fragile while warm.

I didn't think these cookies were very "pumpkin-ey."  They could stand more pumpkin flavor.  I also thought they were a bit floury.  The icing is very tasty.  I wouldn't add extra powdered sugar as it takes away from the caramely flavor.    I have had better pumpkin cookies, these were just ok.

This is a wonderful recipe, very well liked by the whole family.  I took them for my son's pre school snack and they loved them.  In fact one child liked them so well he made up a song about them.  LOL  :-)  My only suggestion is to half the icing recipe because it made way to much.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these to send thru the mail, wanting something for the holidays that would be good after a week in a box, and I also made other cookies with it, and these were the only cookies that got there still moist and fresh!

These are very good cake-like cookies, but the frosting is the true winner!  It was delicious, easy to make, and it set on the cookies just right so that you could stack the cookies in a container and not have the frosting stick on everything.  I think the next time I will add some more of the traditional pumpkin pie spices and maybe cut back a tad on the baking soda, since this seemed to leave a bit of an after-taste to me.  Thanks for sharing.

These pumpkin cookies were quite good, but I prefer a chewier texture rather than cakey.  I think I will try them again, but I will substitute butter for half of the shortening and see how that turns out.  The icing was great!  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and kept the icing on low on the stove, which allowed it to be thicker.  I then dipped the top of each cookie in the icing and laid it on a cookie sheet to harden.  I took these cookies to work and got rave reviews!

These are wonderful!  I just made half a batch because I was trying to use up a half can of pumpkin and I wish I had made a full batch.  These really are great and the frosting YUM.  I did use more powdered sugar in the frosting to thicken it,margarine instead of shortening, but other than that made the recipe as writen.  I did flatten the dough slightly before baking and as always I use parchment paper. GREAT RECIPE!

These cookies were DELICIOUS......plus it makes a huge batch.  I didn't have 2 cups of shortening, so I used 1 cup shortening, and 2 cubes real butter....the frosting was so good, because it wasn't your typical plain white icing......The pumpkin cookie itself was good because I'm not into a real spicy cookie...it just tasted like a pumpkin cookie.....This will be a favorite of our family.

Cookies are great; moist and cake-like. Felt like the cookies themselves needed a touch more flavor; in the next batch I will attempt to take out a 1/2 cup shortening and add 1/2 cup pumpkin as well as add nutmeg and cloves. Frosting is great, and adds just enough sweetness to the cookies.
I let the frosting cool completely. If you are going to dip your cookies make sure they've cooled a bit or the edges may break and you'll have cookie in your frosting!
Recipe x 1.5 makes about 4-5 dozen cookies (depending on size) so there are plenty of cookies at home, for neighbors, and to share with co-workers.

These are incredible! I followed the recipe exactly, but I halved it because I only had one cup of canned pumpkin leftover from another recipe. The cookies turned out perfectly. I used the Pampered Chef Large Scoop (it's like a small ice cream scoop or a large melon baller) and flattened it out on the side of the batter bowl so each cookie would be the same size. I baked them at 350 on a stoneware pan, and I know they were in for more than 10 minutes, but I'm terrible about using a timer. I just checked them until they were very slightly browned on top - probably 12-14 minutes. They flattened out a bit but looked like muffin tops and once frosted, I had to defend them from my teenagers until I could get a pic. My half batch made exactly 22 cookies, (exactly 22... the kids were skeptical and didn't steal any cookie dough) The cookies are good sized, about 3" in diameter and 3/4" tall. I am afraid to walk back into the kitchen to see the carnage... there are probably none left. These would be great with a cup of coffee or to take along to a luncheon, if you can keep them safe for that long. Next time, I bake when I'm home alone. ;)

ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!! They are like mini cakes! I turned down the oven to 325 and took them out once they started to turn light brown round the edge and they are soooo light and soft! The icing I had to add a little more powdered sugar and it was the BEST!!! Make sure you flatten the cookies before you bake them- I read that tip ahead of time and it helped with the icing! Thanks!

Excellent!  I added protein powder and dried cranberries so my daughter can have them at school for a snack.  We also lightly drizzled the icing, you don't really need to drench them.  Other than that, left them as written.  These were so delicious.  They will be a staple snack in our home.

Amazing!  I wouldn't change a thing.  They are not overly sweet on their own which is perfect for our family.  We decided not to use the frosting.  This recipe does make a huge batch but I love this because we make what we want and freeze the rest in little dough balls, then put into a zip lock for easy thaw and bake cookies later on!  Now they will be all ready for the next time we have a craving.  Probably tomorrow, they are sooo good!

These are awesome cookies.  Following other reviewers suggestions I increased the cinnamon to 4 tsp and added 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and doubled the frosting.  My hubby used the extra frosting in the morning on toast.  Almost like a maple bar topping.  Very good

These are great so chewy and yummy even days later they taste great. The icing is a little hard to figure out at first I just ended up spooning it over each cookie. TIP: Make extra frosting I ran out 3/4 of the way through my cookies. Also this does make alot of cookies I got 6 dozen 1 1/2" cookies from this recipe. My family went crazy for them and my mother in law begged for the recipe. Thanks for a new tradition.

These are the best cookies in the world. My family may never let me bake any other kind of cookie ever again. They combine the best of cookies, cakes and muffins all in one. One word of advice, make sure the cookies are off of the baking sheet when you pour the icing. Otherwise the heat of the baking sheet melts the icing too much and it thins out on top and pools around the cookies.

Wonderfully good cookies. I made three batches at different times because they were repeatedly requested. This recipe makes moist, flavorful cookies with  fabulous caramel frosting. I used butter-flavored crisco and added pumpkin pie spice. I baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I also scooped them out with a 1/2 cup ice cream scoop and dipped my fingers in water in order to pat the batter smooth. As another reviewer said, they don't spread out and any peaks or edges will remain after baking - thus the need for patting them down. I lost my friend's recipe for pumpkin cookies and was in need of another one. This one was very similar and I will make them again and again.

These turned out amazing! Make sure to adjust the serving portion because this made soooo many! I brought them to work and everyone loved them. The only thing I did differently was that  I melted some cream cheese frosting and put a spoonful on half of a cookie and I did the other half with the carmel frosting....it made something similar to a black and white cookie. Those I enjoyed those more than the single carmel frosting ones. I also added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and ground cloves (a suggestion by a previous reviewer) to spice it up a little. Then I sprinkled some nutmeg on top of the frosted cookies as well. I cooked some of the batches about 5 minutes longer than suggested and they came out more like a cookie, the others were a little soft, still very good, just different, more like a cake-cookie. I will make these again for sure!!!

This is an awesome recipe & definitely one to be used often.  Everyone loves them!  

I used organic sugar in the cookie recipe which added a bit of molasses flavor, & substituted organic vanilla soy milk for milk in the glaze.  I got a little carried away with "eye balling" the soy milk, so the glaze was runnier than it should have been, as a result I turned each cookie over & dipped the tops in the glaze.  YUMMMMM!  

A meatball scoop is a handy dough shaper, so the cookies took about 14 or 15 minutes to cook.

THE FROSTING IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!! The cookies were soft and moist even a few days after they were made. They are not too sweet ,s o the frosting is a nice complement. We are making this a Fall staple in our household. Alothugh, we did add some ginger and pumpkin pie spice to the cookies.

I'm giving these a 4 star rating because they turned out just as they should. However, I've discovered I do not care for this type of cookie, quite bland with a very sweet glaze.

These were so easy to make and so yummy!! I cut the recipe in half, used fresh pumpkin puree, added a dash of allspice and cloves to the batter. Otherwise kept it the same. Instead of spooning the caramel overtop, I used a piping bag and had a blast decorating them. I took a batch to work as well as to my boyfriends' family and everyone raved about them. Next time I will add a tiny bit more pumpkin-y spices. Surprisingly good, thank you!!!

I am waiting on my last pan of cookies to bake while I write this review.  They are great cookies but something must have gone wrong with my frosting.  It certainly doesn't look like the picture on the recipe.  But they taste awesome.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.

I thought the pumpkin flavor in these was a little bland, but I received such rave reviews at work that I think this is a great recipe.  

I didn't change a thing, except you do have to spread the cookie batter out before baking because they do not spread at all.  I think I may add a few walnuts next time.

Yummy cake-like cookies.  I put in a little extra cinnamon in and I think next time I will use the specified amount.  Loved the frosting too.

Just love this recipe! We had lots of extra cookies even when we halfed the recipe & my husband took the rest of the batch to work and they were a hit! I always have all these ingredients in the recipe on hand in my pantry so this was a easy pick for some cookies to make on a fall day!

Very good. These were a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly and it made a ton of cookies. Way more than I thought. Next time I will cut the recipe in half, but definitely a big hit at Halloween with my family!

These were really good.  The frosting was awesome.  I found them to be a little dry but I took them to a cookie exchange and they were a big hit.  I would definitely make them again.

I cut the recipe in half and made almost 3 dozen cookies.  I ran out of sugar, so I substituted a third of the sugar called for with brown sugar.  They were absolutely yummy!  The 10 minute baking time works fine with the smaller cookies.

I just made these cookies today.  They are delicious!  I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.  I also needed to bake them for 15 minutes instead of 10.  I did not make the frosting - and think they are sweet enough without it.

I chose this of all the pumpkin cookie recipes on Allrecipes because I was running out of time (people leaving early for Christmas vacations) and I still had fudge to make. These were indeed quick and easy to make. I used a medium cookie scoop to measure them and yielded 4 dozen big soft cookies for gift giving. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and increased the cinnamon to a tablespoon. And I used a different frosting. I found a recipe here on Allrecipes for cream cheese and confectioner's sugar icing and turned these yummy cookies into sheer elegance. Any cookie getting rave reviews from long distances deserves five stars in my book., Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! I made a bunch for my office and got rave reviews.  They are a cakey-cookie, soft and moist, so if you're looking for a crispier cookie find another recipe.  These are best when warm but hold up regardless. I stored mine in a ziplock bag for over a week and they were perfectly fresh when delivered.

I made these tonight and I will definitely make them again. I took the advice of some and added one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I also had to thicken the glaze/frosting up as it was waay too runny.  Once the extra confectioners sugar they frosted beautifully. That being said, my husband and I both thought they were delicious. These are super moist and have a cake type of texture. I also had to extend my baking time since I used a medium cookie scoop(about 15 mins total).

These came out mushy, not sure why. We added extra cooking time and chilled the dough but still not a cookie or cake texture.

This cookie is a big hit with my friends and family in the Fall.  I wouldn’t change a thing with the recipes, however I add white chocolate chips to my batter.  It gives the cookies a bigger kick!

These cookies are fantastic and simple to make. I followed the recipe for the cookies, however I did add Nestlé toll House pumpkin spice morsels. I also am not adding the frosting because I added the morsels instead. These cookies are great because we don’t like cookies that are overly sweet. These are just sweet enough.

These cookies are very sweet, and have a cake-like texture. 
The only change I made to the original recipe was to add 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the dry ingredient mixture to boost the flavor.
Just a heads up for prep: it takes quite a bit of beating to get the pumpkin and shortening to combine completely. Also, the icing thickens and is easier to spread if you put it in the fridge for 10ish minutes after making it. A  thin film will form on the surface, but stirring  it with a whisk takes care of that.

These cookies fly off the plate! My one tweak is that I use the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this website instead of the one included (I also follow the user recomendations on the icing and cut the cream cheese in half)

I make this recipe every holiday season. I only limit it to the season because if I didn't I would be huge. These cookes are soft and perfect and easy just the way they are. But I love them even more dipping them in melted chocolate chips instead of the icing included in the recipe. I also sometimes make them with butter instead of shortening and they are just as good.

I came to reprint this recipe and was  SHOCKED at the small amount of reviews. My family LOVES these cookies. I have been making them every holiday season for the past 6 years. The first Thanksgiving I made them, a few people hid a plate full so they could take some home. It is my favorite family story and we have since renamed them Tio Stan's cookies
Few pointers:
1. Help cookies with their shape, push peaks down.
2. Use  a kitchenaid mixer, I wouldn't double the recipe it was too much for my size mixer.
3. put kids to work with the sifting and the icing, we like to dip the cookie to ice them. They do drip a lot this way so put paper or  cheap tablecloth under the cooling racks  to toss after. I also sometimes run out of icing for the last 5-6 cookies but I have a few people who like them that way so it works for us.
5.They leave just enough flavor in your mouth that you crave another and then another so BEWARE.
I used a recipe calorie count and put in 76 cookies and they come out to 125 calories each.

These cookies are delicious!  I always make extra glaze because we like it flooded with the yummy maple topping.  Easy to make and they always come out soft and cake-like.

This recipe is amazing. The only changes I made were I did 1 1/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar in cookie mixture and added nutmeg and cloves. The brown sugar glaze really makes the cookies. Super moist and delicious. And I'm really picky about cookies so that's saying something??

I just won a baking contest at my daughter's school with this recipe.  I recommend using butter instead of shortening...but the cookie doesn't matter.  It is all about the frosting.  I am convinced if you use enough frosting, you will win!

Everyone loved them!  They are a little on the soft side, which I didn't mind.  If your looking for a flavorful cookie thats going to punch you in the tung with pumpkin and fall spices this recipe isn't the one your after.  This cookie has a subtle flavor that I find refreshing every fall, after having eaten so many other fall recipes that are so strong and over powering.

I found a recipe on how to make my own pumpkin spice.  But other than that I may have used double the vanilla.  This was a very great recipe and everyone has been trying hard to get me to make these again.

Wonderful recipe! I just dropped the cookies onto the tray for my first batch. For my second batch I made a mixture of cinnamon and sugar (1tsp cinnamon for each tbsp sugar), dropped a spoonful of dough into the mixture and rolled it into a ball. I flattened the balls of dough a little bit because my first batch ended up being a little dense. The second batch turned out perfect! I like thicker frosting instead of glaze, so I only added 2 tbsp milk. I forgot to add vanilla extract, but it still ended up being tasty! Next time I make this I want to try using butter instead of shortening, and maybe add a little pumpkin spice as others suggested. Can't wait to bring these to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!

I have to update a review, as this has become a favorite for many of my friends, and a signature cookie!! I always add chocolate chips and today decided to add a bit more cinnamon, and some almond extract because I love the flavor.  Makes tons of cookies and are so delicious!

I didn't think they had enough depth of flavor to get a 5. The batter tasted like it would have been better with. Down sugar instead of white. The white sugar was already a done deal so I added 2 Tb of molasses. That helped.

I added pumpkin pie spice instead of just the cinnamon, and added mini chocolate chips.  I didn't frost them and they were great.  I think just the cinnamon would not have been enough flavor for these cookies.

These cookies were almost like a miniature cake. Very yummy. I did add 1/2 tsp allspice as was recommended by someone.  I used fresh pumpkin, so I had to add more flour.  I'm taking them to a pumpkin carving party!

These were superb.  I took some of the suggestions and added an additional cup of powdered sugar to the icing.  Made a depression in the cookie with a soup spoon just after baking, then took a half spoonful of icing and dropped it in while it was still warm.  Looked pretty and small effort!  I added some extra pumpkin, so it needed to bake a tad bit longer.  I removed when it felt firm with my spoon and didn't ooze pumpkin :)  Enjoy, these are very good!

This was the first time I attempted to make this cookie and they came out delicious. One thing I would do differently is creaming together the shorting and sugar first before adding the pumpkin because my batter came out lumpy. No harm done they still came out good. Great recipe if your looking for cake like cookies.

These cookies were wonderfully soft and moist. They don't spread out  at all so I'd suggest flattening them a little before baking.  I halved the recipe and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for half the flour. I only used about half of the icing.

Followed the recipe and these came out great. We made them for a bake sale and got rave reviews! Dipping the cookies in the frosting works out great.

These are cake-like and addictive! My only issue was I had a very hard time storing them without them getting really soggy. Excellent with tea.

very good - i had intended to bring some to some friends at school, but my boyfriend liked them so much he wanted them all to himself! however, the icing never hardened completely, and then got soft and ultimately runny after a few days, i'm not sure why.

I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin baked goods, but I made these for a couple of parties. Boy, did they ever go fast. People loved them, and I got several requests for the recipe. I made them pretty much exactly as it says here, and then added a candied pecan to the top of each of the cookies.

I followed this recipe exactly and I have to say I was not impressed at all. It wasn't the worst cookie I've ever had but I definitely won't be making it again. I agree with some other reviews in that I really don't think this should be called a cookie. It's a tiny cake. I could also see it being better with more spices. I followed the recipe and it came out very, very bland. Also, I added about a cup more of the confectioners sugar to the icing and cooled it in the fridge with hopes it would thicken up a bit but the icing still came out very runny. With some alterations, this recipe could be good but I was really disappointed in the way these came out.

Yummy! I used butter instead of shortening & added pumpkin pie spice. These are so tender & delicious. I made them for 3 different events this holiday weekend and they were: GONE!

This is a great recipe. I had a 1 can of pure pumpkin leftover from Thanksgiving dinner and was able to use it for this recipe. I did substitute the shortening and used unsweetened applesauce. The cookie is very moist and cake-like.

SO GOOD!  Words cannot describe how much I love these cookies.  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  Also, this recipe makes MUCH more than 18 cookies (more like double that!).  If you only want 18 to 20 cookies, cut the recipe in half.  However, these cookies are HORRIBLE for you - truly a heart attack in a cookie!

My husband and kids ask for this cookie weekly.  My co-workers ask for it also.  Thank you Peggy Ackerman for sharing.  I took one reviewers advice and made the frosting before I even started the cookie - so it had time to cool.  I may even add a few pecans to the frosting next time.

I usually don't eat pumpkin flavored items but once a year.  I had a taste for something pumpkin and I tried this recipe.  The cookies were really good.  I used 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon and added some allspice and ground clove.  After cooking the first two patches I realized I forgot to add the eggs!  Even without them the cookies held their shape and were good.  Oh yeah, I had to add more powdered sugar to the icing.  I will be making these again.

These are the best cookies. They never last very long even though the recipe makes  a lot. They didn't have quite enough flavor by themselves so I sprinkle pumpkin pie spice right on the warm frosting. My favorite to make for the Holidays!

These were so good! These are a part of my Halloween/Thankgiving special recipes that I will always make! I had trouble with the frosting part. For some reason it was very runny and I kept adding more and more confectioners sugar.  It still didn't want to stay on top of the cookies - it ran all over! Anyway, probably something I did wrong! Anyway, the taste of these were really good! Thank you for sharing!

Made these for the family this weekend and didn't even get a chance to frost them before they were over half gone. Next time might just sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar before baking!  But would like to try the frosing too! Did use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Big hit at my house!

These cookies are out of this world! I made them for my sons Marching Band concession stand and they sold out quickly! He requested I make them again for a bakesale in school as they were so good. They do make quite alot which was good in this case. I did add allspice to them. I noticed the longer the icing sits, the thicker it does get so I didn't have to add any more sugar to thicken it up as one persons review suggested. I will be making these again and again! Thanks for sharing

It took me a long time to bake and dip all of the cookies this recipe made but they were so worth it! The only complaint I have is there is no good way to store these once baked. I didn't want to put in the fridge b/c the cookies are supposed to be soft when you bite into it and I was afraid they would harden too much if refrigerated. I used ziplock containers instead and placed wax paper between each layer of cooled cookies. The icing stuck to the was paper and the cookies were pretty sticky by the next day. Still tasted fine just ugly looking. There was plenty of icing leftover. Maybe next time I will only bake half of the batter and save the extra icing since this made more cookies than we could eat - even after sending a dozen to my sis!

Made these last night and both my co-workers and my husband co-workers love them!  The glaze really makes the cookies even better.  I had to tweak the recipe to allow icing to complete cool so it thickens up a bit and drizzle over cool cookies and not warm cookies.  If cookies and icing are either warm, the icing will just runs right down the cookies and not stay on top.  I will definitely will be making these again!!  Yummy to the tummy!

Very tasty!  I used only butter (because I don't have shortening and don't particularly like its taste).  They were moist and soft.  I used fresh pumpkin.  They did spread out more than I thought they would (next time I'll add more flour).  The icing was yummy.  I added a bit more cinnamon.  My son loves them.  I halfed the recipe...and still got so many cookies!   I took two "cookies" and put a bit of icing between them and created my own pumpkin creme pies! YUM!

These cookies were amazing! I made them exactly as stated, and everyone loved them. Brought them to work 2 days after baking and they were still moist and soft. My coworkers have already requested that I make them again. :D

These are amazing cookies! I love pumpkin, but these are made even better by the frosting.  I too added more powdered sugar to thicken the frosting. My son declared them "the best cookies you've ever made mom!" :-)

These cookies should be called "Holy **** Cookies" because that's what you'll say when you bite into one.  SO good.  So moist and flavorful. Instead of 2 cups shortening, I did 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortening. Didn't change anything else.  Incredibly tasty. If you're on a low-calorie diet, don't make these, because you can't eat just one.

What a great recipe! Not exactly healthy, but if you are looking for a cookie recipe you probably are not concerned about calories. The only thing I did differently is that I added fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin.

nice moist cake like cookies. I found I had too much frosting and it was a tad too sweet and runny for my taste. Next time I will cut the frosting in half and it's possible I didn't let it cool enough being adding the icing sugar or something which caused the icing to be to thin.Overall an excellent cookie that I will make again and again.

Best Pumpkin Cookies I have ever had. Easy to make, and makes a lot of cookies. I would suggest cutting the recipe in half, I was almost unable to fit it all in my largest bowl.

These were quite good.  More cake-like than I expected.  The icing can be cut in half (at least) and I'd recommend letting the cookies cool a wee bit before icing.

I made this cookies for my son's religious class dinner.  They went.  The teens loved them.  So I made them again for my job and people raved about them.  They deliciously moist like little cakes with not all the sweetness.  They're great for the holidays.  Enjoy... :-)

I thought the consistency could've been more cookie like instead of cakey, but my friends and family loved these.  Just the right balance of sweet for me :).

Definitely agree that this is more like a biscuit. They don't expand much, but rise instead. I sprinkled walnuts on top of the sauce. My family said it was light treat.

Definitely needs the frosting on top, otherwise, it just tastes like pumpkin-spiced flour.

These were very good.  I didn't think the icing was necessary, as they were great plain.  However, I did add the icing like the recipe said and the cookies got sort of messy from there on.  I had to add more flour because the cookie dough was a mushy blob with no shape or form and that ended up taking away from the flavor.  I would add more flour and then more spices to balance it out.  This recipe made way more cookies than I wanted.  I got at least seven or eight dozen from these.  Someone asked for the recipe, though.  I guess that's a plus.

Good soft cake like cookies.  I am glad that I read other reviews before I started.  Helpful hints:  after cookies come out of the oven use a spoon to flatten the cookies for a place to ice, I also added an extra cup of powdered sugar to the icing to thicken it, I also put the icing in a squeeze bottle to ice the cookies and worked out great and less messy.  When I make these again I will add nutmeg, additional cinnamon and maybe allspice to the batter.  Cookies are good but could have a little more spice.

Awesome!  I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the cookie and nearly 2 cups of powdered sugar to the icing.  I think that if I'd let the icing cool for about 2 hours, I wouldn't have needed as much powdered sugar.

I usually do not like pumpkin..but, after reading the reviews I decided to try these. Boy, am I glad I did. They were delicious!! Will certainly make them again.I didn't have any cinnamon (at least I couldn't find it) so I used pumpkin pie spice. It called for two tsp. of cinnamon and I figured the pumpkin spice had cinnamon in it so I only put one extra tsp. of that in , instead of 2 tsp of the cinnamon. I also used it for the two 1/2 tsp. of the other spices. Turned out great.

Yummy cookies. I used 15 0z. can of pumpkin and I loved it, but I don't think it would hurt to add a little more to up the pumpkin flavor. The cooler the icing is, the thicker it will coat on the cookies.

Very nice cookie--more cake than cookie as many reviewers have noted. I added pumpkin pie spice for more flavor and it could have used a bit more. Would have been very bland without. Kids loved them.

It made about 60 cookies. Next time I will cut them recipe in half becuase I still threw away half the batter. My kids loved these cookies! Even without the icing they are delicious! It took my four boys less than 24 hours to eat them all!

AMAZING! Recipe makes little cakes, not cookies. Sooo moist. The pumpkin flavor is perfect - not too overpowering. Definitely drizzle the icing on (I did it with a fork). Dipping the cookies in the icing makes it too sweet IMHO. I got about 5 dozen out of the batter - enough to share at work & school this week!

Wonderful!  They appealed to all age ranges.  My 4 year old ate 5 of them before they were frosted.  The frosting was a little too runny but a little more powdered sugar fixes that.

These were okay. I followed the recipe to the letter and they weren't bad, but they weren't very good either. Kind of bland, and far too cakey. I was expecting a sort of half breed of chewy cookie and moist cake, but they really are just like little cake circles. The icing was divine, though.

The flavor in these fall treats is so amazing! The only thing that bothered me a bit was the "cakeyness" of the cookie.  Don't get me wrong, I love soft moist cookies, but these seemed a bit too soft.  Regardless, I took them to work and everyone loved them.  Very delicious!

Made these and the only thing I changed was adding two teaspoons of pumpkin spice.  Brought some to work and they were gone in an hour- with people begging for the recipe.  Little tiny cakes... moist, and delicious.   Cant wait to make them again.

This type of cookie (more cake-like) is not usually my 5-star favorite; however, this recipe is so versatile that I did give it 5-stars.  I did substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for white and did the same for flour substituting 1 cup of wheat flour in.    I made 3 different icings: the recipes (powdered sugar icing), cream cheese icing, and Pumpkin Cookie V brown sugar/powdered sugar icing which I liked best. My DH liked the cream cheese the best. I split the brown sugar icing in half and mixed toasted pecans in. On the cream cheese and regular icing, I alternated sprinkling iced cookies with cinnamon or toasted pecan pieces. It looked like I had a whole tray of different kinds of cookies out of the same batch. Guaranteed to please everyone! I did add pecans to my batter to the last half of my batter as well and then finally made some with mini chocolate chips (which surprisingly, I didn't really care for even though).   Thanks for the good fall pumpkin recipe. Now I have 3 pumpkin favorites: pumpkin pie, pumpkin dessert, and these cookies.

I made these this morning and Oh, My! I just loved these cookies!! I used to live in the Northwest and there is a store called Fred Meyer and they sold pumpkin cookies. I found this recipe is better than what I bought from the store! I did use butter flavored Crisco, 1 can of pumpkin (it is just shy of 2 cups) pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and some clove. I used a 1 3/4" ice cream scoop to place the dough and wet my fingers and pushed the tops down a bit. (they still popped up a bit). When I iced them I let the cookies cool at least 15 minutes and then dipped them into the icing. I kept the icing warming on the burner and stirred often to keep the "crusting" down. I got almost 4 dozen cookies that were almost 3" in diameter with the ice cream scoop. Theses will be made several times this winter!! Thanks Peggy!!

Not that this is needed, but I believe praise is deserved where work of arts are created. I made these cookies for my coworkers and they went nuts over them. I mean absolutely crazy. The tasty cake like treat is simply delectable.

Great recipe. We had a slight mishap with the icing, but nothing a few chocolate chips couldnt fix.

Yes these cookies turned out great. Nice and soft. It made about 4 dozen decent sized cookies. CHANGES: I used half butter, half shortening. One comment for the instructions, cream sugar and fats BEFORE adding pumpkin so it surely mixes. Great cookies!

These were something different but great! I halved the recipe and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I also cooked longer (15min) and they came out perfect.  Also, like another reviewer suggested I used 1/2c applesauce in place of 1/2 c of shortening My house smelled amazing while these were cooking!

These are delicious...even when you forget the eggs!  Yep, that's what I did.  They still turned out great.  I just baked them a bit longer...more like 20 minutes.

These are the best pumpkin cookies ever. I get plenty of requests to bake these and also for the recipe. I have not tried the caramel icing with these. I either use cream cheese frosting or just dust them with powedered sugar.  Try this recipe, you won't be sorry.

Cookies turned out really well although I had to bake mine for 20 minutes, not 10 like it says (I could probably have even cooked them another couple of minutes). Also, I would cut the icing measurements in half, way too much to use on one batch of cookies!

Our family absolutely LOVES THIS RECIPE! I have learned to double the recipe because they are all gone the minute they get set out for eating! ;)  Here are some alterations that might help you. 1) they almost always need longer in the oven. I would suggest putting them in for 15 min. instead of 10 min. 2) I added a teas. more or so of cinnamon . (I am a real spice-lover!) You could also add 1/2 teas. cloves, and/or 1/2 teas. nutmeg. 3) if you want to store them, put them in an air-tight container and HIDE THEM! ;D Believe me, they will be eaten in no time at all!   I give this recipe 2 thumbs up. They are like little bites of rich, moist, heavenly cakes.   I know you'll love it!!

This recipe was deliccc! The only thing I added was a little bit of pumpkin spice and I baked the cookies for 13 minutes. To make all the cookies come out the same size I suggest you try using a truffle sized ice cream scooper. They came out perfect and had just the right amount of sweetness. Yum! :)

For medium size cookies, I had to baked these 20 minutes.  They are very good, and soft...just right for the fall season.

All the reviews are true, this many people can't be wrong.  I was out of canned pumpkin, so I used sweet potatoes instead, about 2 cups after mashing with a potato masher. I also used pumpkin pie spice and vanilla.  I did have to bake them longer than specified, about 20 minutes.  Really good and the icing really does make it.

This recipe works well. So far I have only made the cookies without the frosting (grocery run tommorow). But without the frosting the cookies taste great. I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, and I substituted butter for the shortening. I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Thank you for the Recipe!

WOW!! These are GREAT!!! The only "complaint" I had was they were very crumbly. So I took 2 and put the glaze in the middle and made sandwich cookies. YUM!! I do not use shortening so I used 4 sticks of butter. May be why...not sure. Also I have to agree with they are better the 2nd day! We are doing a cookie exchange at work and I wanted to do something different (I am afraid we are going to have 20 people bring in chocolate chip cookies!!) this is for sure what I am bringing (if I can get them out of the house!!).

Wow! Are these ever delicious! I am so glad I tried thiese cookies. I had 1/2 a can of pumpkin left over from another recipe so I was just looking for something to use it up. I made half this recipe, and it made 44 ccokies, dropping the dough about the size of a walnut. I greased the cookie sheet, and let the cookies cool a few minutes before trying to remove them and they came up easily. (I mention that because I hate it when cookies tear up.) 
I don't know how they will taste tomorrow, but warm with the frosting dripping off they are heavenly! Next time I will make a full batch. Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent recipe, and the icing is what really makes these special.  I added pumpkin pie spice (2 t) and a dash of nutmeg to the cookie batter and I had to bake them much longer than 10 minutes (maybe 14-15 min). I would definitely make them again with the same modifications.

These were so good, my kids thought they were frosted cake donuts.  I am however looking for suggestions on storing them.  I put some in the fridge, and some I left out.  The ones in the fridge stayed better, but after a couple of days they start getting sticky.  Maybe they needed to cook longer???

These cookies were great! I take cookies to work every week and this was definitely a favorite, I even gave the recipe to a few co-workers. I substituted butter for the shortening and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. These are a very cake like cookie but I like a more cake like cookie. The flavor was really great!

I made these to bring into work. Everyone is raving about how good they are. They are fantastic. I do think when I make them again I will cut the recipe in half. It makes a TON of cookies. But they are so fabulous.

Note:  whereas the directions say "to make frosting" - they mean icing!  do not expect this to be real frosting.  Also, this says it yields 18 cookies - well, i made them smaller and got about 3o cookies and the cooking time was over 10 minutes per batch meaning, i think the cooking time is really wrong!  you can't possibly have a 1/4 cup of a cookie cook in 10 minutes.  just like a bakery cookie though - really good!  followed directions exactly.

These cookies are great.  I substitued pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, and I used a maple icing recipe from a different pumpkin spice cookie and the combination was amazing!  These cookies are cake like and soft, not a bit over powering.  Everyone loved them! Also, I used a cookie scoop to keep them nice and rounded.  No 'pokey' tops.  Best pumpkin cookie I've ever tried.

These turned out so wonderful. My entire family couldn't get enough. I made 56 cookies and they were gone in 2 days. I tried to follow the recipe as written, but I only had 1 cup left of shortening so I used that and 2 sticks of margarine (well, whatever Parkay is). It turned out just fine, better than fine if you ask my family. I also did add an extra cup of powdered sugar to the icing. I tried "dipping" the tops of the cookies in the icing like others have suggested, but that just didn't work for me. So I had to do it the hard way and spread each cookie with icing. I will tell you though, make sure the cookies are warm when you spread the icing, it makes the icing smooth out and looks much nicer. This is no doubt a keeper. I have been asked to make another batch today.

Yummola!  They're like little pillows of frosted deliciousness.  The only issue I had was that, in experimenting with frosting these (turning them over and dipping the tops is best) - I ran out of frosting before completely done.

Just like everyone before me said, these cookies were delicious!  My whole family raved.  The only thing, (as many have said) was the icing was a bit too liquid. I think next time I would decrease the milk and butter by half and keep the same amount of confectioners sugar.  I think this would reduce waste too, because it made so much. I am definitely making these again, probably for Halloween, then again for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Wow, I loved these cookies!  The only thing I did differently is added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and instead of the glaze I used the cream cheese frosting II from this site and sprinkled the finished result with cinnamon...great, great, great (I loved them even plain!!)

Fantastic!! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon, tsp of ground ginger & 1/8 tsp of ground cloves. **Great tip for the frosting: Do NOT let it cool! Leave the burner on low/med-low heat and add the confectioners sugar (I did 3 cups total, 1C at a time) & vanilla. Leave on very low heat, and dunk the top of the cookies in the glaze--let glaze drizzle off and put on a plate. SO easy & the cookies look great--one smooth sheet of glaze! Any stray glaze blobs can easily be picked off-it cools/hardens quickly. Next time I'm going to add Craisins, they'd be great in this!

I love these cookies!!!! I have made them for my family, for my coworkers, and even made them to sell at our work snack bar. You can't have enough of these cookies. The recipes is perfect don't change a thing... just keep a eye on the cooking time. I have even made these with vanilla coffee mate creamer, I didn't have vanilla and they were wonderful. Thank you so much for such a wonderful yummy cookie!!!!

These cookies were certainly delicious!   I am always suspicious of blandness, so I doubled the cinnamon and added some grated nutmeg and ground cloves.  I usually only like chocolate sweets, but these are so good!!

Absolutely fantastic. I was suspicious at first with the 'cake like' description, and I was doubtful they'd turn out. They were AWESOME, and a huge hit with everyone. I've passed this recipe around to so many people now. It's a must-try :)

Very soft and chewy cookies, which are easy to make. Everyone enjoyed them. A few people started stashing them away. For a perfect shape, dip fingers in water, shake most of the water off and then shape the top of the cookie as desired. Also, dipping the whole cookie into icing was a bit too much sugar for our taste, so I loaded a freezer zip lock bag with icing, cut off a tiny end, and squeezed away. A+

These cookies, even without the icing, are absolutely delicious! I had my thin friend who never eats anything downing these 4 in a row... trust me, everyone will LOVE them. My advice: leave the icing off, they're perfect on their own.

These cookies are really good! I made half the batter with butterscotch chips. I also drizzled the glaze on the cookies that contained butterscotch instead of spreading it because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  The butterscotch really complimented the cookie.

I believe these are the best cookies I've had... ever!!!  The glaze makes them amazing.  I am totally addicted.  I made a little extra glaze, I also made the cookies with half shortening/half butter and a little extra flour becase the dough was a little wet.  These were just fantastic.  Thanks a million for sharing.  My husband also gobbled them up and said they were fabulous and he doesn't even really eat a lot of cookies.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband, his friends and all his coworkers!  My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe.  I changed the recipe after reading some of the suggestions in the reviews.  Also I needed to change ingredients since most items needed are not exactly the same in England.

Instead of 2 cups of shortening, I used 1 cup of Stork (shortening) and 1 cup of Bertolli butter (healthier that way).  For the spices I used; 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  Although next time I think I will used 1/8 teaspoon of cloves. For people who aren't from the US, caster sugar (white sugar) and bicarbonate soda (baking soda) should be used in this recipe.

I had to adjust the cooking time to 25 to 30 minutes.  My cookies spread out instead of staying in the shape on the tray.  This last time I made the cookies, I used a small muffin tray to keep the same size and shape.

Thank you for the recipe and happy cooking.

These are absolutely the best cookies I have EVER had.  I had some leftover canned pumpkin I wanted to use so I figured I'd give these a try and now my husband and I are in love.  I don't usually like to gush, but these really are just superb.  I added some pecans to half the batch; I liked it but my husband said it distracted from the moist, gooey goodness of the cookie. Both ways were great though, depending on your preference.

One of the best cookies ever!  I halved the recipe to use some leftover pumpkin and I immediately ran out to get another can of pumpkin to make this fabulous cookie!

The cookie was very moist and flavorful.  The icing took it over the top.  I would rate this up there with the top 3 cookie recipes that I have.  Will definitely continue to make this recipe.

I made this recipe for a work Christmas party and the flavor was wonderful! They were so moist and the perfect amount of sweetness- not too rich. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I had a few problems baking them. They rose up very high because they are so cake-like. The bottoms of my cookies burnt and they tops remained doughy. I eventually ended up smashing the dough down very flat before I put it in the oven. They came out beautfully after that. Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely put on the icing when the cookies are warm -- the icing scours the cookie like lava down a mountain.  The cookie recipe is great.  Definitely a recommended choice for pumpkin cookies.

For some reason, I can't seem to make these cookies beautiful.  BUT, it doesn't matter!  They are delicious and soft.  Friends say they are addicting!  I used butter flavored crisco and stuck to the recipe.  Yummy cookie!  Thanks for sharing.  Update:  I scoop the batter with a cookie scoop sprayed with pam and have beautiful rounded cookies!  I too use a squeeze bottle and drizzle warm frosting.  LOVE it!!!

Best pumpkin cookies I've ever had.  You hear all the time about stuff melting in your mouth well these do!  It did make a lot of cookies.  I put the extras in the freezer but kept eating them because they were awesome frozen too.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was my first time making pumkin cookies. I thought the recipe was wonderful. Fairly easy to make and my family loved them! I changed it up a little by using cream cheese glaze since I has some left over frosting from another pumpkin dessert and it worked wonderfully. We will use this again. (like next week when I thaw some dough) It does make a ton of cookies!

These cookies are great! Very soft and flavorful.  I did not love the glaze though.  I couldn't get the consistency right, and it just ran all over the place.  I will be looking for a different topping for these the next time I make them.  
This does make a TON, so beware.

Splendid. These were exactly what I needed. The cookies themselves are not overly sweet, so the additon of the glaze made them perfectly balanced. The recipe did make a lot more than I expected. I dropped them from an average sized cookie scoop, and ended up with six dozen. Which in my house is eighteen servings, so I guess it is accurate. I will also be using the caramel glaze on other baked goods. Thanks.

More cake like than I enjoy but they were snatched up at the bake sale. Doubled the spices as others did too. The frosting is great I'll use it on other recipes.

YUMMY!!! that's what everyone said about this recipe.  My kids and husband couldn't get enough of these and I was told I should sell them.  A definite keeper. Can't wait to make them again

This recipe has been in my family for years.  Can also add 1-2 cups boiled raisins and/or 1 cup chopped pecans.  The best holiday cookie!

WONDERFUL cookies. Absolutely amazing. Perfectly cake-like and fluffy. Added semi-sweet chocolate chips to half the batter and had no problems, like other raters might have. I enjoyed them best with the chocolate chips. Will definitely be making these cookies regularly.

AMAZING!  SO GOOD!

I made these exactly to the recipe (although there was no specification as to how much batter to use per cookie.)  I used a heaping tablespoon of batter for each cookie and baked them for about 13 minutes.  I made the icing and drizzled it over the cookies with a spoon.  I will probably make them again very soon and I may omit the frosting or make half with frosting and half without (I liked it better without, but a lot of people loved the frosting).

If my boyfriend askes me to marry him, it will be because of these cookies!  I didn't make the frosting and added white chocolate chips.  Just a warning to anyone else that may add the chocolate chips, they tend to seperate from the cookie dough.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!
