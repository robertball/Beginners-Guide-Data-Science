I made this tonight to go with T's Sweet Potato Fries (from this site) and it was so good my bf used it for the ribeye and asparagus too! I didn't have any cream-style horseradish so I decreased the amount a bit (about 3/4 as written) and used Beaver's extra-hot grated horseradish. It was awesome...thanks!

Good stuff! We always have A1 in the house so this was perfect. I didn't have creamy style horseradish sauce so I just added a little light mayo to the mix. This is definitely better than just plain ketchup!

This was money. To give it more of a kick I used chili sauce. I did stir in just a little mayo just a couple tbsp but that's a personal preferance. We ate every bit of this. NOTE: You're best off doubling this if you are a condiment happy family like us. Otherwise you'll just have to get up and make another batch in the middle of dinner.

It kills me to read a negative report when the reporter tried basically another recipe. To me if you didn't follow the recipe keep your mouth shut. That's my 2 cents. TheReaper!

Made exactly as written. Paired it with "Cajun Spicy Potato Wedges" and "Homemade Shake and Bake Mixture" chicken tenders both from this site. Next time I'll make a double batch because we had zero left.

This is a great sauce and easy to adjust to your preferences. I loved the suggestion one reviewer made about adding some mayonnaise I'll try that one minus the steak sauce for a lobster cocktail which I'm sure will scandalize my fellow Mainers! I can't believe that one reviewer gave a poor rating when they had the nerve to admit they used a horseradish sauce "that contained beets". Pretty nervy if you ask me!

I cut the recipe in half and had to use a horseradish sauce that contained beets as that was all my store had (the beets didn't affect the flavour in my opinion though the colour of the sauce was affected). We just didn't care for how this tasted but it wasn't bad. It may be for some but not for others.

All I tasted was horseradish.... I didn't measure all that great so maybe that was part of the problem but the combination of flavors just didn't seem to go together all that great.

Delicious! This was a tangy sauce that added a nice flavor to the fries.

I prefer ketchup. I bought steak sauce for 2 tablespoons of nothing.
