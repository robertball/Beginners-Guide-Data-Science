Fabulous recipe, very easy, the broth is just perfect.  One thing I want to add, for people who are new to making dump;ings (most recipes for dumplings aren't newbie-friendly) is make sure your dumpling mixture is a wet-sticky dough.  If you make the dough too dry and pliable, your dumplings will come out too chewey,  A sticly-wet dough will make a soft, fluffy and delicious dumpling.  Unforunately I learned this through experimentation and not the recipe!

Ok, let me begin by saying that I'm writing this review as this particular dish cools to an acceptable eating temperature.  However, I have had a few bites of it - practicing the "reverse blow" method - and let me tell you...it is good.  I modified the recipe only VERY slightly.  I substituded "cream of chicken AND mushroom" (Cambells - at Publix) for plain cream of chicken.  I didn't measure onions or celery - used 1 whole (medium) onion, and 2 1/2 stalks of celery.  I added approximately 1/3 package of sliced baby portobello mushrooms.  Can we tell I like 'shrooms?  I must admit, I did peek once after adding the dumplings, but I was afraid that if I didn't stir it at least once, something would burn.  I would suggest, you prepare the rounded dumplings while allowing the simmering process to take place.  After letting the dumplings cook, I did add a combination of 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of cornstarch + ~1/2 cup of extremely cold water = a thicker base.  Total cooking time, an hour and a half.  Then again - I was drinking bottles of Budweiser during the wait - so I didn't mind too much.  I fully intend on keeping this recipe around for a while.

Absolutely fantastic recipe.

I'm not much of a cook; I'm the baker in the family and my husband cooks.  But he wasn't feeling well so I wanted to make him something easy and delicious and comforting.  I've never made a dish similar to this, and I expected it to be difficult, but it was very easy to make, and an absolute hit.  I omitted the celery seed; otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  The whole family loved it.

My one criticism: I would double the soup for a family of  four.  There were enough dumplings but we needed more liquid.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. I would rate it a 4.5 if i could, the only reason its not five is because I had to make a number of changes to make it really perfect.  I usually add some extra veggie, celery, onion, carrots, peppers. whatever I have on hand.  I also add some garlic, a bay leaf and poultry seasoning. I add some fresh herbs (parsley, or dill) to the dumplings. With these change the recipe is DEFINATELY a fice.

This is a definate keeper with a couple moderations. 

 I added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, instead of 1.
 Instead of using chicken broth (it's so expensive in the store for just a small can), I cooked my chicken by boiling it in salted water with 4 chicken bouillon cubes. 
 In addition to celery seed, I added a pinch of sage (or about 1/4 tsp.), a pinch of garlic powder, a dash (or about 1 tsp.) of basil, a dash of thyme. 
 I would omit the onion the next time. It ended up stuck to the bottom of the stew when I steamed the dumplings. In my opinion, it doesn't need them. 

This makes a wonderful chicken stew. It's thicker than my mom used to make, but frankly, it's better that way! The dumplings are just like Mom made, too.

great recipe...here's a piece of dumpling technique for you...before you dip the spoon in the sticky dough to make a dumpling, stuck it in the hot broth...the dumpling will slide off the spoon like nobody's business...you're welcome...smiles

Fantastic recipe!  As other reviewers have done I did tweak the base to my taste, but the dumplings were absolutely perfection just as written.  In the end, the dumplings are what make, or break, this recipe.  I made a double recipe to feed 8 so I used a Dutch oven.  Also, I seared the chicken and veggies first in the Dutch oven so none of the flavor was lost, removed them, made the soup, and added the veggies and chicken back at the point the recipe says to do it.  I added sliced mushrooms to the onion and celery mix.  I also added thawed frozen peas just before dropping the dumplings in.  With a single recipe a large sauce pan would be fine, but doubling the recipe I was glad to have the surface area of the Dutch oven for the dumplings.  Finally, after reading reviews I went low sodium with every ingredient and the result was not too salty at allâ€¦. On a comfort food scale of 1-10 this was an 11+.

Great recipe. I added 1/2 cup chopped carrots and sauted them with the celery, onions and chicken. I also added an extra can of chicken broth and cream of chicken soup. This made for more broth. I added two diced and peeled potatos to the broth when I added the chicken mixture. A little parsley in the dumplings made them a little prettier. I just loved this recipe and my boys did too! I will definatly make it again!

Scrumptous! This made an excellent dinner that needed no side dishes! You have your meat, vegies and bread all in one stew-like dish. This was the first time I made dumplings and it went quite well. I could have cooked them a tad longer but it was still very good. The changes I made were very minimal. Used Olive oil instead of vegie oil to cook the chicken, onions and celery, added rosemary to the dumplings and did not sift the flour. The next time I make this (and trust me there will be a next time!) I will double the recipe for the broth mixture (cream of chicken, chicken broth and milk) because it could of used more of that and I will season the chicken breast's. I'm not quite sure with what yet but chicken is such a bland meat. It was very moist and tender in this dish though! This was also my husbands first time having chicken and dumplings (weird!) and he liked it. THe only complaint from him was also that it could've used more of the broth mixture. But anyway, FABULOUS!

Very yummy!  I made some changes due to what I had on hand.  I went to take out my chicken thighs and they had turned, so I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken.  I also used cream of mushroom soup, with about a tbsp of poultry seasoning.  Used sour cream instead of milk, and added carrots.  Followed recipe for dumplings exactly, except I added some chives, and they came out perfectly!  The trick is to BARELY mix them.  My daughter, who is home sick from school, is enjoying this as we speak.  Thanks for sharing!  PS-If my chicken hadn't gone bad, I planned to brown it directly in the soup pot...why lose flavor in a pan?  :)

In the midst of a winter storm, I found myself wanting chicken and dumplings.  All I had was chicken breast in the freezer and had always boiled whole chickens before to make the dish - but I wasn't about to go to the store.  I found this recipe and it beats the pants off of mine!  I tweeked it a bit by adding a few shakes of poulty seasoning, a chix bullion cube or two and carrots.  I also  thickened the stew just a little with corn starch and water as we like ours very thick - but this was delicious and sure to be a winter staple at our house.

UPDATE!  My orignal review was a five, but I just made it again and realized the first time I'd forgotten to add the spices before dropping the dumplings. I wished I'd done it again this time, 'cause there is WAY TOO MUCH CELERY SEED. It is completely overpowering.  Don't add it at all, or add only 1/4 tsp or so.  Here is my review the first time around when I didn't add the celery seed:  This is a really delicious, easy recipe.  I doubled the sauce mixture (to 2 cans of soup, 29 oz of broth and 1 c. of milk), as did want more veggies in this dish and needed more liquid.  So I cubed potatoes and carrots (about 1.5 cups each), boiled them for 10 minutes and then added them to the chicken soup mixture with a cup of peas (canned) just before dropping the dumplings.  I also added black pepper and parsley to the dry ingredients of the dumplings for color and taste.

This recipe was okay. But after cooking it, I wish it had had more vegetables in it. Next time I make it, I'm going to add carrots and peas.

I loved this!!! I used regular cream of chicken soup and 2 cups chicken broth I made with chicken bouillon/soup base.  I add carrots and cut chicken up bite size.  Sooooo tasty.  Never made dumplings - these were easy and very good.  Thanks!

We loved it!  My boyfriend says its a definite keeper.  I did a few things differently.  I used some chicken breast I had already roasted.  Also added some poultry seaoning for flavor and some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  Yum!

A good recipe.  Easy to fix.  However, I prefer my chicken and dumplings in more of a thickened broth.    It just seemed like it tasted a bit too processed.  However, the dumplings were fantastic.  I had made dumplings only once in my life and it was disastrous...raw and heavy.  I took the advise of one reviewer in that when you mix the ingredients for the dumplings, mix until just incorporated and spoon into hot stew.  Dough will be very sticky.  That was the key to my success!  And I might add....I used a large cookie scoop (the spring-loaded kind) that held about a heaping tablespoon.  Sprayed the inside and out with Pam spray.  It made quick work of dispensing of the dumplings into the stew.  Next time I may tweek this recipe a bit for the stew, but the dumplings will be the same.  Thanks for a good recipe.

The whole family loved this, and the dumplings came out just right! I am so happy to have a good easy dumpling recipe that doesn't come from a box!   I did double the soup portion, and we had just enough. My father used to make something very similar to this but he used milk instead of broth, and I think I prefer it that way, but broth is cheaper! My husband, however, raved over this and even ate the leftovers, which he never does! This has been put on the rotation, ty!

I've never made chicken and dumplings before, so I was a little nervous about the dumpling part. There wasn't a lot of liquid, so I added a can of cream of mushroom and a can of milk to counter the extreme thickness. I also added some bay leaves for a little extra flavor during simmer time. As for the dumplings, they turned out great. I made sure my mixture was wet and sticky as per another review. My only problem was that a few of the smaller drops got a little gooey. But the bigger full spoonfuls became nice and fluffy. Definitely going to cook this again. My 1 year old gobbled it right up.

I had never made chicken and dumplings  before.  They came out delicious.  The dumplings were just delicious!  Next time I will double the cream of chicken, stock and milk.  I let mine simmer too much it came out kinda dry.  Other than that, it was a very good recipe.  will keep making it.  Kids and hubby liked it.  Thanks!

Great and quick recipe.  I'm used to making my own chicken and dumplings with a whole chicken in the pot, straining the broth, etc, and I just knew the family would make some silly comments about Mama using a can of soup to cook with.  Was I wrong!  The family loved it!  A bit too salty for me, but I know how to make it less salty next time and will not subtract from the  5 star rating.  I was pleased to see a recipe for dumplings that used oil instead of solid fat. A keeper.

Really good!  I only changed a few things, like adding some carrots, and using 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup cream to make it creamier.  I also put some dried parsley in the dough mixture.  Can't wait to make this again!

I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever find a good chicken recipe on allrecipes again and I did!  This soup was so good, especially with the addition of more fresh veggies.  Thanks so much!

P.S. I'm a garlic freak, but a clove or two really adds another dimension of flavor to this soup.

I just happened to be making this when my Mother-in-law and her mother "dropped in" for an overnight visit. They are very down-home, very Southern type cooks, and I always get the feeling that my cooking is too "new age" for them.I was so glad I had something so tasty on the menu, no one noticed that I had used low-fat soups. It got the seal of approval from Granny, who asked for the recipe (the ultimate compliment!)It made the house smell warm and comfortable on a rainy October night. Thanks for sharing!

Nice base recipe.  I added a full cup of water during the cooking as there wasn't much liquid.  I was afraid it would be too watery but it still thickened up nicely after the dumplings finished cooking.  Also added chopped carrots and more seasoning as I didn't have celery or celery seed.  I was afraid I overmixed my dough (have made dumplings before and wasn't thinking as I mixed everything together really well) and they turned out perfect!

I have made this recipe before and let me tell you, it is great.  But, this time I bought an already cooked rotissere chicken and great became FANTABULOUS!!  The only reason I didnt rate it as a 5 is because I like mine a little brothier than this recipe made.. I doubled my broth  by using one carton of chicken broth and one carton of organic veggie broth.. PERFECTION!! 
 (p.s.  it is great wtih bell peppers too!)

Excellent! My family loved it. The only change I made was adding a bay leaf while simmering the broth. The dumplings were wonderful, and I didn't peek.

OMG--this dish is INSANELY easy to make and INSANELY good! I've never made dumplings before--but following the recipe made it very easy and they turned out great.  I would only recommend adding a dash of parsley! 5 stars!

This recipe was ok but salty. I used reduced sodium chicken broth and healthy request cream of chicken soup (lower salt). I did not add any other type of salt. The dumplings came out great and the chicken was tender. I used chicken tenders instead of the whole breast because that was all I had.

Pretty good...I left out the celery and onions and added peas, potatoes and carrots to the broth mixture.  Next time, I'd leave out the celery seeds as they were a bit overpowering.

You'll want to Double the broth mixture for sure.  I only had 2 large boneless breasts, and still needed to double it.  I cooked the breasts in the chicken broth w/onions & seasonings (added a bay leaf, poultry seasoning, dash of garlic powder), then pulled & shredded, back in with the canned soups and milk, added carrots & celery then; simmered about 15 min's then added the dumplings.  Add some dry parsley & pepper to the dumplings too.  This was actually better than I expected.  A good "cheater" chicken and dumpling dish when you don't have the time or ingredients to start with the whole bird.  Thx for the tasty short-cut!!

We loved this recipe! I did as another reviewer suggested and boiled my chicken, in about 4 cups of water, added bouillon to the broth along with some garlic pepper, celery seed, salt/pepper and basil. I didn't have celery so I used carrots. I boiled the carrots and onions with the chicken. I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup. I made the dumplings small and they were perfect! Careful after you put the dumplings in, mine boiled out of the pot onto the stove. Quickly go back to simmer from the boiling point after adding the dumplings. This is worth it!

would have given 5 starts except that I made some changes. really good recipe.  I precooked the chicken, seasoned with celery seed, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I shredded this and put into the soup/broth mixture with the diced onion and celery. I also added some diced carrots and potatoes. I added some more garlic powder to the pot at this time. Over all a very good recipe, and I look forward to making this again.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  I boiled my chicken in lightly salted water and saved the broth instead of using canned.  Also, I put 1/2 tsp. of chopped dried rosemary in the dumpling dough and added a little more milk so it wasn't so dry.  I think I will add a carrot next time for more color.

I can only give this recipe a 4-Star due to the fact that I had to make some minor adjustments.  I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken and one can of Cream of Celery and two cans of Chicken Broth.  I cooked my chicken ahead of time and shredded the chicken.  I used Bisquick recipe for dumplings which were excellent!!  I think 1 Tsp of Celery Seed is way too overpowering in this recipe.  Next time I'm not even sure I'll use it, or if I do, it will only be a few dashes.  With those changes, this was an awesome dish and one that I will make again!

Excellent recipe for Chicken and Dumplings, although I do Dr. it a bit. I double the amount of soup, broth, and seasonings to make more gravy. I also add baby carrots and a tsp. of thyme. When I make the dumplings, I add a little fresh chopped parsley or thyme. Sometimes I skip the dumplings and serve it over biscuits instead. Everyone in my family enjoys this recipe and I make it often.

I really liked this recipe.  I followed the earlier recommendations and added the veggies and doubled the broth and creamed soup.  I also added in about 1/4 cup sherry before adding the dumplings.  Delicious.

This was the first time I've made chicken and dumplings, and it turned out awesome. I always thought dumplings were slimey, these were the best dumplings ever. I'm making these for my mother-in-law when she comes into town.

My boyfriend really loved it, I didn't.  I wasn't a fan of the dumplings or the broth.  Even with additional broth, herbs, onion, and celery, the broth just tasted like canned soup to me.

Yum! This was delicious and pretty easy to make. I did not use the celery seed. I did add carrots and a few of my own seasonings: parsley and nature seasoning.  The parsley in the dumplings, as suggested by another user, was a great addition. The dumplings were light and fluffy, very scrumptious. :)

Very good recipe.  I used cream of mushroom because I had it, added thyme, carrots, peas and 2 cloves of garlic.  It was a little salty so I added water.  The dumplings are AWESOME!

Yummy! We had cooked a whole chicken in the oven earlier in the day, so used the breasts and one thigh. Only had a couple of shallots and some celery, and added garlic too. Sauteed the veggies, added the cooked chicken to heat through, and then dumped in the broth, soup and milk. We also used Bisquick for the dumplings. Cooked with the lid on for about 15 min. Removed lid and cooked a few minutes longer. Thickened with a flour/milk mixture. Husband and picky son gave it two thumbs up! Nice easy delicious dinner!

This is my first time making or eating chicken and dumplings and I approve!  This recipe was easy to follow and I love that it had basic ingredients that I already had in my home.  Like many other reviewers, I did add some carrots and I also wish it was more broth-y.  This will be a great winter meal.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated and was really disappointed. It came out extremely salty. And it barely fed two adults.  Will be trying another version next time.

EXCELLENT!!!!  I used whatever "cream of" soup that I happened to have at the house.  This is by far the best chicken and dumplings recipe I have ever made...or eaten!

So good! I made my own stew by stewing chicken thighs with herbs & spices in water, adding store bought stock and some heavy cream at the end. Followed the recipe for the dumplings exactly, but doubled it. Delicious!

Great recipe and very easy. The only thing I did different is i used wheat biscuits out of a can to make it even easier (i can't eat white flour).

I give this 5 stars and my family gives in 4 stars.  We usually make our dumplings the rolled out way, with clear chicken broth made from several hours of cooking on the stove top.  My husband grew up with these big fluffy type of dumplings.  We still all like the rolled out version better but this is nice for a change.  Much heavier than we are used to.  Definitely double the broth as suggested by others and I actually 1.5x the dumplings and we still ran out for 4.

Very good.  I did add about 32oz of chicken stock and threw in some carrots.  Next time I'll be sure to double this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a hit with my family. I used home-made chicken broth with no salt added, cooked shredded chicken (from making the broth), and I used whole wheat flour for the dumplings. I also used my pressure cooker which sped up the cook time dramatcially. Delicious! Thanks for sharing! I will definately be making this again!

Delicious! I didn't think I liked chicken and dumplings, but I ate 2 bowls of this!  Everything just came out really well - it was easy enough to make, ingredients were things I had on hand. And the dumplings were not too thick or chewy. I did end up having to tweak it quite a bit to suite our family of 6. I originally doubled the broth/soup/milk mixture, but did not double the dumplings. I will double them both next time - the ratio just seemed off. I should've followed the recipe as stated! Also, added about a 1/3 cup finely chopped carrot, and only used about 1/4 cup finely chopped celery. Next time I'll omit the celery seed - my husband thought it was over-powering. But it was sooo good. We all loved it! A keeper, for sure. Thanks for sharing!

These were only okay. Like some other reviewers said, there was not enough broth, and the onions burned and stuck to the bottom. It was still edible and the dumplings were good, but I would not make this again.

Best I've found.  I vary the actual chicken soup some (seasonings) but the dumplings are perfect.

This was great and really easy.  I didn't use celery, like so many other people.  The dumplings cook best when they're made pretty small, if too big they can be kind of doughy.

These dumplings were killer!  Just an FYI.  This makes 12 dumplings.  For my family of six I doubled the recipe and it overfilled us all!  Yum!

I made this at my husband's request, myself not knowing what to expect since I'd never had chicken & dumplings.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I made the recipe as-is and in the future I would probably double the broth mixture so it's more of a soup consistency.  I would also cut back on the celery seed to perhaps 1/4 tsp. as I felt it was overpowering.  Otherwise, a keeper.

5 Stars! My husband stayed home from work sick today and I wanted to make him a comfort food his mom use to make.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast- I sauteed them in olive oil along with carrots, chopped green peppers, and onions.  I didn't use the celery.  I Seasoned it with all-purpose seasoning, onion salt, and pepper.  Once that was done, I drained on a paper towel and I added it to the soup mixture.  I used TWO 10 oz cans of chicken broth and 1, 10 oz can of cream of chicken soup.  As for my dough I used this recipe's directions- BUT I added 1/3 cup of Hungry Jack "extra light and fluffy" pancake mix.  This made the dumplings extra fluffy melt in your mouth!  Also if you make this you should set the dough in the frige for 30 mins to allow it to firm more.  I cut the chicken breast into small cubes, and I cut the dough into small cubes.  I think this was best because now you have a spoonful of each. (yum) If you want to be creative you can add a can of green beans or peas.  I added a can of green beans can you say "WOW"? lol.  I simmered on low for about 15 minutes longer than the time suggested in the recipe. This allowed the dumplings to soak up more of the chicken broth and for the soup to thicken more.  This was truly the best ever I will be making this again.  I feel so proud this was my first time making chicken and dumplings...thanks for this recipe!

I love this recipe.  It's been a while since I've made it, and I had to frantically search the site to make sure that it's still here, but I found it!  The dumplings turn out great - light and fluffy - and don't use a prepackaged mix, which scores bonus points with me!

While this was very good, I did have to "help" it, and it still wasn't the chicken and dumplings I remember from when I was a kid.  I changed up the cooking method and cooked the chicken, onion, and celery (and I added carrot), then added in the milk, soup, broth and seasonings.  I found the liquid in this recipe a bit bland, so I tossed in some pepper and a chicken boullion cube - that helped a lot!  Also, on the dumplings, I increased the amount of milk to about 3/4 c because another recipe said that your dough needs to be very runny/sticky for it to produce fluffy dumplings.  Mine did turn out quite fluffy and moist, so I am glad I did the milk increase.  This was good, and I will probably make it again, but it still wasn't quite what I was looking for.

I only used the dumpling part of this recipe as I like to make my own soup to go with them. Usually I use the bisquick recipe but was out today. I'm so happy I was out because these dumplings were wonderful! I'll never use that nasty bisquick again. I did find that I needed a little more milk and oil to make a nice sticky dough. They turned out so fluffy and perfect! Thank you for this recipe!

This is great! My family loves it! It is quick and easy. I try to buy the lower sodium soup whenever on sale. I also like to toss my cooked chicken strips in taco seasoning for an extra kick before adding it to the soup mixture. Thanks for sharing!

So good! I made some changes, so I'm only giving this recipe a 4. I cooked the chicken breasts in a carton chicken stock from the grocery story with a bay leaf in the slow cooker on low for about 7 hours before shredding it. I sauteed onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in olive oil, then added the cream of chicken and cream of celery recommended by other reviewers. I added the chicken stock from the slow cooker after i skimmed off the fat. I let all that cook for the 35-45 minutes. Then I added the 1/2 cup milk and probably 2 tsp. cornstarch to the liquids. Then threw in the chicken and plopped in the dumplings, which i added some fresh parsley to. This was some serious comfort food.. SOOO glad it's (somewhat) healthy! Can't wait for leftovers!! THANKS!! :)

This is perfect comfort food. I had been looking for a good recipe for chx and dumplings since my husband requested it and this was simpler and lower in fat than most I found. I did make adjustments based on reviewers' suggestions: added a can of cream of celery, increased milk to 1 1/2 c., added a small bag of frozen mixed veggies and used reduced fat bisquick for the dumplings. You definitely need to increase the soup/milk in the recipe, esp. if you add veggies.

This is fantastic!  I made a couple changes: instead of a can of chicken broth, I used 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes (will change that to 2-1/2 cups water and 1 cube next time), and I cut the chicken into bite size pieces.  I used whole wheat pastry flour for the dumplings and they turned out great (I never go wrong with WW pastry flour).

Great recipe, but made a few changes after reading other reviews.  Added 1 1/2 cups milk, only 1/2 tsp. celery seed, a dash of basil and thyme, sliced carrots, and  just enough milk to the dough so that it was real sticky.  Turned out perfect and my 18 mo. old ate the most I've seen him eat at one sitting.

I did not make the chicken part of this dish but I used the dumplings for my beef stew.  I have only had dumplings with my Grandma's stew and they were not like these.  Regardless, these were delicious.  I could not get enough of them.  Also I added dried parsley, and s + p.

This was excellent. The broth came out thick, like a stew, rather than like a soup and I actually liked it that way. I added carrots to mine, and added 2 cups extra water to accomodate and it was still thick. It was a tad on the salty side, but I did substitute 1/3 real chicken broth and celery salt as seed was not on hand. I'm sure without those changes it would have been good. Next time I'll make more dumplings (the dumplings themselves really only served the two of us, with a half serving left over) and increase the liquid. But it was very flavorful and very easy for tihs first time dumpling maker. My husband(whose favorite food is chicken and dumplings!) loved it!

Forget cooking all day; this is such a quick and easy way to make chicken and dumplings!  I hate to post a review if I made changes, but I don't think these changes affected the overall taste (just the time it took to prepare).  I sauteed the veggies (with the addition of some carrots); added the chicken, soup, broth, and milk; and then cooked it in the pressure cooker for about 20 minutes before going back to the directions for the dumplings.  The result was a comforting meal that only tasted like it cooked all day.

This was great and easy to make.  My kids loved it!  You might want to try adding chicken granules to the mix, it turned out really good and adds good flavor.

This was excellent, but next time I would use a little less salt in the dumplings.  I also dumped some carrots in, which added flavor and color.

This recipe was easy and yummy.  I usually use chicken flavored stock bullion, but I don't like how my stew turns out a strange yellow color.  My stew wasn't that color with this recipe (and I made my own broth out of bullion).  I love how this recipe uses cream of chicken soup.  It's something I always have in my cupboards and it really "made" this stew.  I added frozen mixed veggies and potatoes.  I used extra cornstarch to thicken and omitted the dumplings.  Instead I made J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits from the recipe on this site.
I've made this twice in the last week and a half and my husband didn't even comment on the frequency.  It's  a great way to stretch a meal.

This was really good and easy.  I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery and omitted the celery seed.  I added extra milk and carrots.  I sent the recipe home with our dinner guests per their request!

It was good and very easy.  I would cube the chicken rather than make strips. I would also add peas, and season the dumplings with some of the suggestions by others here.

This recipe is one that my boyfriend and I need to laminate! It is absolutely delicious, and the fact that it is low fat makes it even better. We've had it twice this week, and to be honest, I wouldn't mind having it again!

Really good...and super easy.  This was  the first time I've ever made dumplings, and I followed it exactly....PERFECT!  Light and fluffy.  My only problem was that some of the stew cooked to the bottom of the pot, so I think I didn't turn it down enough after it boiled for the dumplings.
Do NOT think you can use a sprinkle of celery salt instead of the seed...even with the reduced sodium broth, I did think mine turned out a bit salty, but that's my fault. 
Next time I'll be cutting a little dill or rosemary into the dumplings...and I'll definitely be using that dumpling mix for beef stews as well...it's a keeper!

Pretty good. I used regular cream of chicken soup. Didn't add celery because I didn't have any. Added 2 fresh carrots chopped.Fried them with onions. Added small can of peas and 1/2 tsp. thyme. The only thing I would do different is double the sauce mixture. Dumplings were light, but not enough sauce to really smother them in. I like lots of gravy and we barely got 4 adult servings.So I will definately increase the sauce for our taste. Yummy! Thanks Linda!

PERFECT! I made this last night adding 2 carrots and using 5 skinless chicken thighs cut up instead of 3 chicken breasts. I also followed the cooking time exactly. WOW! The dumplings were light as air and the taste of the soup was fantastic. This will definately become a staple in my house!

Wow! I can actually make chicken and dumplings and
not feel guilty the whole time I'm eating it! This
recipe is delicious and easy to make. I used fat
free cream of chicken soup and fat free broth and
the dish was still rich tasting. The dumplings are
light and fluffy. This has become a family favorite. Thank you Linda! PATTIH5

This was a good recipe with down-home taste, however...you definitely need to add extra vegetables of your choice in order to bring out the flavor(I added carrots, green beans, & peas).  The dumplings were excellent!  I'd say if you want a thicker  broth, definitely add cornstarch as I've read in other reviews, otherwise you will have a very "soupy" chicken and dumplings.  Family really liked it and I'll definitely make it again, maybe with whole chicken.

After reading other reviews, I used cream of mushroom soup and used my own chicken broth.  The dumplings turned out absolutely perfect â€“ everyone claimed they were the lightest they had ever tasted.  This is a keeper.

My husband and I liked this recipe a lot but my kids didn't. No surprise there... there was no peanut butter in it LOL! Very tasty anyway. I threw in some frozen veggies to make it more stewlike. I'll make this recipe again for sure.

I doubled as there are 4 of us and one being a teenager lol, so I used one can cream of chicken then the other cream of mushroom. Did make some other changes as well. I didn't use onion or celery or celery salt, instead I used potatoes alot of starch but a couple of us are picky eaters and I'm allergic to onions. Also added some corn Too. This was delicious

My family loved this! I just poached the chicken in spices instead of cooking it in a skillet, although this was just for convenience:) The only other thing I changed was celery seed in the place of the actual celery because I had none on hand. This was amazing, and I cannot wait to make it again. :)

I just finished and it was DELICIOUS.  It reminded me of my grandmothers.  I gave it four stars because as many others have stated I doubled the liquids (broth, cream of chicken and milk)and it was just right for four people.  The four stars are for the original recipe. I did make adjustments (but I believe everyone does in order to make the recipe their own.  I used 4 chicken thighs which I seasoned and simmered in a pot with a 1/4 onion and water that more than covered the thighs for about 1hr (I took a nap :-) ).  When the thighs were done and tender I cooled them a little and removed them from the pot and removed the skin and bone.  I measured out 29 oz of broth (the liquid from thighs) mixed with two cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup milk.  I simmered until all of the cream of chicken dissolved.  I then added a can of carrots, a can of string beans and the chicken.  I simmered for another 30 minutes.  I wanted it a littler thicker so I dissolved 2 tbs in  4 tbs of water and added it.  I did not make the biscuits (I had planned to make another slow cooker recipe but I did not start it early enough) I used one can of grands which I cut in half and placed on top.  I then brought to a boil and simmered with the lid on as the recipe instructed. Next time I will try and make the biscuits they sound good.

This was my first time making dumplings and was very good! I was worried cause I'm really not a celery person, but it wasn't to much at all! The only thing I changed was I dumped a can of mixed veggies in it! I felt there was plenty of liquid and I look forward to making this again!

this is a lot like my moms.  However, I like a little more juice so I added about a cup more of broth.  I also added to my dumplings some fresh chopped parsley and a little jalapeno from our garden. didn't add very much salt as the soup still has some salt.  we use Dash instead wow what a tasty dish.  thank you and enjoy my changes to the recipe.

Husband loved it!  I've just never been a fan of chicken and dumplings.  But i followed the recipe exactly when I made this last night, and he was still raving about it this morning!

This dish turned out delicious! The only thing I did different was double the ingredients for the broth to make more. I read another review that said the dumplings should be sticky/tacky when you put them in to make a perfect dumpling and they were right!

So good that it has become my go to recipe for Chicken and dumplings.  I pretty much stay with all the ingredients and it's VERY good. You can definitely adjust the salt if it's too salty and tweek the seasonings.

This was the basis of an amazing Chicken and Dumplings recipe for my family!  We followed the advice of several other reviewers and added a few changes of our own...we also used 1 can each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  Instead of chicken broth, I used one packet of Knorr's Chicken Stock Concentrate and reconstituted it with 3 1/2 c. of boiling water.  I also doubled the milk.  We added fresh chopped basil, 3 cloves minced fresh garlic, 4 peeled, sliced carrots, increased the onion to 1/2 c. and omitted the celery.  As other reviewers suggested, we cooked the chicken and vegs in a dutch oven and did the soup mixture in a different pan, adding it to the dutch oven when the chicken was ready.  The two other changes we made were to add frozen peas just prior to the dumplings and we used the recipe on the Bisquick box for the dumplings.  This made things a lot easier.  Prior to adding to the peas, we did add 1 tbsp of cornstarch with 3 tbsp of cold water to thicken the soup.  With our modifications, this was a rich, satisfying meal for a cold (as in 20 degrees below zero) winter night!!

Super easy recipe, however I found it to be missing a little something, so I tweaked it a little...

STEW: I used 4 cans of broth and 3 cream of chicken soup (we like our broth!), I added diced carrots, crimini mushrooms, minced garlic, thyme to the celery and 1 med onion and deglazed the pan with approx 1c of white wine.  Next time I will also cut back just a bit on the celery seed.

DUMPLINGS: Added garlic powder, parsley, black pepper and grated parmesan and used buttermilk in place of regular milk.

The kids even ate this (which, believe me, speaks volumes) so this one will be going into the favorites!

Great base.  Like most folks I added carrots.  I also added some chopped kale to up the nutritional value. I might thicken the base a bit like some others noted when I do this again.

Yea!  I made Chicken n' Dumplings! For what ever reason, I've never gotten around to making the age-old favorite. This was a simple recipe to make which made my first attempt a success! Hubby & 2 teenage sons were happy....so, I'm happy.  Of course, I doubled the recipe so we have some leftovers. Also, I added some mixed veggies.  It was delicious, Thank you.

Great flavor.  We added basil, cardamom, and garlic to the dumplings.  We had plenty of liquids, making the recipe as written.  My only complaint was it didn't make a lot.  We'll make it again though.

I've made this several times, but tonight I added more dumplings (1 1/2x).  I used half whole wheat flour in the biscuits and added carrot to the 'soup.'    These changes worked out well.

Great!  I added the extra broth, carrots and poultry seasoning.  Intended to add frozen peas but I forgot until I was at the dinner table-maybe next time.  I also cooked the chicken for about 1.5 hours so it was nice and tender.  I'll make this again!  Tastes just like Grandma's!

I rated this a 4/5 only because I modified it. It's easy and delicious! I had never made chicken and dumpling before this...  I added a cup of chopped carrots and extra celery. Omitted the Celery Seed, since I didn't have any. I also seasoned the chicken with a bit a salt and pepper and used the "Cream of Chicken with herbs." I also added some Italian Seasoning to the dumpling mix and a bit of garlic powder. It took me 1.5 hours to prepare and cook.  I also served it over garlic mashed potatoes! So yummy, and my fiancÃ© loves it too!

Great recipe!  I added peas and carrots to give it more flavor and color, also added italian seasoning.  Cheddar cheese on top is a nice garnish too.  Definitely make sure the biscuit batter is sticky wet--they come out moist and fabulous.

This recipe is fabulous!  I made a few changes to hearty it up a bit.  I added carrots, peas and mushroooms to the soup mixture.  The extra vegetables were very good.  This recipe is very simple but sooo good.

awesome recipe!  we loved it.  only thing was it got stuck on bottom of pot when doing dumplings and it sucked up most the broth.  not sure how to fix that and is likely my lack of experience.  thanks for this one.

I didn't make the whole recipe exactly as is, but it took very well to substitutions. I had turkey thighs instead of chicken breasts, I started by sauteeing a frozen mire poix mix from my grocery store, I used grapeseed oil in the dumplings and pulled them off heat after 15 minutes, then removed them to a serving platter while I added back in the meat and some  frozen peas and let the liquid part simmer for minute. I seasoned it to my own taste with garlic, pepper and onion powder, then poured the meat, veggies and gravy over the dumplings. Perfection!  Anyway, this recipe deserves the 5 stars because:  1. Most of the recipes for dumplings on this site resort to "canned" biscuits but this one gives you an excellent and easy dumpling recipe.  2. The method of covering the dumplings right away is correct... most recipes say to leave the lid off for the first 10 minutes but I've always found that  produces disintegrated loose dumplings.  3. I think the chicken dumpling broth is greatly improved by thickening and extra "chickeny" flavor, so the cream of chicken soup is a good call. (Though you could also throw in a bullion cube and thicken with a little cornstarch at the end if necessary.)  4. It is a great BASIC recipe that you can modify A LOT and still get a good result.

Simple but absolutely delicious! Of course, I altered it slightly to make use of a few leftovers, but the basic recipe was the same and I followed the dumpling recipe to the letter.   The only thing I did wrong was not leave enough room for the dumplings to rise when I covered the pan (they stuck to the cover!). But that was my fault, not the recipes.   I made what I thought would be enough for two meals but had almost NOTHING left over.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the broth/soup.  I also added yellow summer squash.  (I sauteed all the veggies first, and browned the chicken in there and then shredded it.  THEN I added all the liquids.)  I followed someone else's advice about the dumplings and added some fat free half and half to the dough until it was sticky.  They came out LIGHT AND FLUFFY.  Unlike someone else's review, I used skim milk and it did NOT curdle.  The dumplings came out perfect with the extra liquid to make it sticky.  This is my GO TO recipe for the dumplings now!

I really love the biscuits, even though there isn't the measurement for milk.  I just added milk until it got sticky.  As for the chicken and veggies, I would add some cream of chicken soup next time because I would have liked it better to be more of a thick and creamy chicken with dumplings on top.  If you don't want the creamy-ness, then keep the recipe as is.

This recipe was good but not great. I added carrots and mushrooms for color and flavor.  One warning is do not use skim milk with this recipe as I did, it will curdle! This has to do with the 0% fat content of the milk. If that's all you have, add it at the very end and/or do not let it boil. Just heat through.
I also found the dumplings too dense for my preference.

Absolutely loved this recipe. The recipe was perfect for someone who has never made dumplings. Everyone got seconds. Be careful not to add things like salt or garlic, as it will overpower the flavor.

I don't cook Chicken & Dumplings (in any form) too often for my family. Specifically because I consider "it" to be one of my nominal "guilty pleasures". After having been eating Chicken & Dumplings for over 50 years and having been cooking it (primarily for myself) for 35+ years, I think this is the BEST Chicken & Dumplings recipe I've ever come across. Sorry Nana.

I like this recipe.  The celery seed is a little over powering.  I'd cut that down next time to 3/4 tsp.  I did add a bouillon cube and garlic powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

This made my family very happy tonight. Delicious meal. Really easy and very little prep. I used dried minced onion since I didn't have fresh on hand and added about 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning to the dumplings. This only gave us 3 bowlfuls though, and I'll admit the chicken breasts I used were on the thin side, but still they each only got 1 serving and hubby has a bowl for his lunch tomorrow and there is none left. Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe.

This was really great... I took the advice from people below and added a can of cream of celery soup and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added a can of mixed vegetables and a can of sliced mushrooms.  Instead of the dumplings in the recipe, I used reduced fat bisquick.  This was really fabulous... creamy and very good comfort food.

I just made this for supper and it was wonderful.  My husband usually hates anything that even remotely resembles a casserole, but he loved this.  I did add some carrots and peas, but that is all that I changed other than adding some parsley flakes to the dumplings to make them look prettier.  I will definately make this again.

I usually add extra liquids- either a can of creme of celery or extra broth or both. Also, I add chopped up carrots which work well with the soup.

I followed some of the others suggestions.  I doubled the milk & added a can of cream of celery soup.  I put in a whole onion & 2 stalks of celery.  I don't like dark meat that much, so this was perfect.  I loved it.  Next time I might add a little extra broth too.  Great recipe...Thanks!

This is a really good recipe.  We also like to add carrots to ours and some frozen peas at the end.  I also add a clove of minced garlic when cooking the chicken.  I do add 2 extra cups of milk though and sometimes think it could use even more.

This recipe was an absolute hit!  My fiance has grown up on his mother's homemade Southern Chicken & Dumplings but he loved this recipe.  They only change I made was that I baked the chicken and shredded it before saute-ing it with the onions, and I also omitted the celery and celery seed (didn't miss it at all).  I have never had Chicken & Dumplings before (much less made them) and I was thoroughly impressed.  We will be making this again often I'm sure.

This is a very quick, easy and delicious recipe.  I used leftover chicken from a whole chicken I had cooked in my slow cooker which saved time.  All I did was to saute the onions and celery and add it with the cooked chicken to the liquid.  I also added a little extra broth and a few baby carrots and frozen peas. Very good.  I'll definitely make it again.

Oh my gosh this was good! I did make some changes though.  I didn't have low fat cream soups so I added regular and I heard it was a little thick so I added another can of cream of chicken soup and a total of 16 ounces of chicken broth. Next time I'll add another 16 ounces of broth because it still was thick.  Even my 11 year old loved it. I'll be making this often.

This was a very good recipe and very easy to make. Only thing was that the soup to dumpling ratio seemed to be off. Not enough soup in my opinion. I'll be adding more broth next time. 
Thanks for this one!

Excellent recipe! I did things a bit differently, hence the 4 stars (couldn't give a full five because I modified quite a bit!) I boiled a whole chicken the night before, chilled the chicken stock and skimmed off the fat before heating it up the next day, and added the spices and veggies.

The dumplings were great! I've found that just the dumplings itself will thicken up the broth just as well. Just make sure you cook a full 12-15 minutes *without peeking* to get it just right. Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe.  Made a few changes.  I realized I did not have any chicken broth so I cooked my boneless chicken with enough water to cover, seasoned it with Nature's Seasoning, chopped onions, celery, carrots, a bay leaf and some thyme and pepper.  I cooked it for about an hour til it was falling apart.  I removed the chicken & shredded it. I removed the chopped vegetables and just used the broth then added the cream soups (used 1.5 cans), milk, and for a richer flavor- I added a small can of evaporated milk also.  I mixed and cooked the dumplings as directed.  It was a great meal.  Thanks for sharing.

This is really, really yummy!  I added a little bit of poultry seasoning (sage, etc) to the broth and to the dumplings.  Came out a little too salty even when using low-sodium broth so I will probably cut out salt in the dumplings and increase the amount of milk next time.  After adding the dumplings to cook, it becomes quite thick so adding milk shouldn't be a problem!  Thanks, Linda!

Awesome recipe...I was so afraid to make C&D but this recipe looked so easy and it was + it was very tasty. I went with the simplier route and bought canned biscuits, cut up into bite sized pieces and added it to the soup at the end. Also, I went with the regular cream of chicken and low sodium broth in the can. One last thing, I added about 2 cups frozen peas and carrots.  Celery seed was used but just a dab. Thank you Linda!

This was a real hit with my husband.  Because he likes creamier soup I added one more can of "98% fat free cream of chicken soup" but that made it a bit salty so I added two small potatoes, diced.

Like most everyone else I added more vegetables (peas and carrots frozen mix, fresh sliced mushrooms) and also a pinch of Poultry Seasoning (thyme, sage, etc.).

A tiny bit of dill and parsley really made the dumplings (which puffed up impressively) look nice.  Not too much though or it'd be overpowering.  In fact, next time I'll just put parsley in.  The dill was a bit too strong for me.

This whole thing BARELY fit in my 2-5/8 Le Creuset Soup Pot.  Next time I'll use a bigger pot.

This recipe was pretty good, however, I found the celery seed a little overwhleming.  If I make it again I will use a lot less, or none at all.

Very, very good!  I added 1/8 tsp. thyme, 1/2 c. chopped carrots and 1/2 c. frozen peas and also doubled the sauce recipe.  The dumplings were so light and fluffy and the sauce was fabulous!

Truly the best chicken and dumplings I've ever had. Easy to make and a big hit with my husband and a bachelor friend. Didn't have the celery seed, but will be sure to get some for the next time I serve this. Thanks!

Delicious! This is comfort food, perfect for a cold winter's night.  My boyfriend and I gobbled it up. This recipe is not only a keeper; it's going to be a standard. I am not usually a fan of recipes with "cream of" soups in them, but this tastes very authentic and homemade. I don't know why anyone would use bisquick (ugh) or frozen dumplings for this -- the dumplings in this recipe are extremely easy to make, and delicious. My only caveat would be to use a wide, shallow pot to cook this in, so that there's plenty of surface area, hence plenty of room to let the dumplings spread out. You don't want to crowd them or they won't cook well.

This was a very good recipe. I've never had dumplings like that before - so light and fluffly, like little biscuits! I doubled the soup and broth, but we ended up with too much, I think. I didn't use onion or celery. I thought the celery seed was a little powerful - I'll use less next time. And my dumplings were a little big, so I'll make them smaller next time. Great recipe and definitely a repeater!

This was really delicious! I altered the recipe a bit by adding 1 can cream of celery soup (I left out the celery and celery seed) and added 1 more can of chicken broth (reduced sodium). I also used 1 tbsp. butter instead of the vegetable oil for the dumplings. Other than that this was so easy and very tasty! Thanks Linda!

As a canadian who moved to Texas, i had never even heard of this dish, but my husband wanted to have it so i chose this recipe.It was so easy, and really a tasty wonderful dish for the whole family. I added frozen peas and cut up carrots to give it more veggies. The dumplings were absolutely fabulous. I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful recipe.  We have had this several times for dinner and everytime, it was a big hit.  It has a very good flavor and simple to make.  I used a whole chicken, cut it up, boiled and deboned.  At the end, I added whole sweet corn at the end.

I changed this recipe to be more like chicken and dumpling soup. I added to cans of soup and two cans of broth.  I also added 1/2 cup of rice.  I also made the recipe in only 1/2 an hour.  I first started cooking the chicken.  As the chicken cooked I mixed the soup ingredients together and started them boiling.  When the chicken finished, I threw that in.  I continued cooking the soup and started making the dumplings than finished off the recipe as she said.  Guaranteed to take 1/2 an hour.  Much better than 1 1/2 hours!  This is going to be something I make often.

This was surprisingly easy to make. We love chicken and dumplings but it's always been so time consuming before. This makes it quick and yet you still get that 'homestyle' flavor. Esspecially nice on a cold winter day!

Very easy and hearty. My Boyfriend lived it. Neither of us had had chicken and dumplings in years. I added carrots and sautÃ©ed  with the chicken, celery, and onions in the pot I was going to make my base. I used a stick of butter in this... why not?? Then added the cream of chicken and chicken broth and milk. I added Rosemary to my dough but I will add less next time. Wonderful!

Thank you for posting this! It's my husband's favorite dinner and I have always been afraid of trying it for fear of messing up the dumplings. It turned out perfect though!! I followed the recipe to a T except I doubled it. I will definitely make it again and maybe add mushrooms as well!

I doubled the soup recipe but will not double the dumpling recipe next time. I thought I would need to double the dumpling recipe but the dumplings didn't all the way because I made the mistake of turning the heat up too high to make sure that the dumplings would cook. So, I burnt the food but my husband LOVES it anyway. HAHAHA! What a sweetheart he is.

Very good when you're in a bit of a hurry. (Instead of a crock pot version.) I used chicken thighs as they stay moist and added a bag of frozen mixed veggies to the liquid.  Also a little sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe is delicious. I followed it exactly, except for the mustard seed. I didnâ€™t have it on hand, but it was still great without it. Next time I will add mushrooms, and maybe more onions. Because I love them. But the recipe is great the way it is.

I made this in the crock pot.  After reading several reviews, this is how I decided to do it.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of chicken broth.  I left out the milk. 
 Put that on top of the chicken, seasoned it with pepper and about 1/4 tsp celery seed and then cooked on low for 6 hours.  At about 4 1/2 hours, I mixed up the dumplings and added them to the crock pot, along with a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  This came out absolutely delicious!

This reminds me of the chicken and dumplings my mother used to make. It was delicious. I did change a few things because I was just looking for a good "base" recipe to work from. I always use a can of biscuits for my dumplings. I roll them out flat and then cut them into bite-sized pieces. I added a can of cream of celery and used an extra 2-3 ozs of chicken broth. I also added 2 sliced carrots. It was delicious!

Super easy and yummy recipe!!! I've made it exactly to the recipe once but never again. Only changes were one I HAVE to add fresh veggies like carrots, celery, and potatoes and I don't add celery seed (because I don't have any). Chicken can be cooked like this or just use the broth and boil the chicken then shred it and continue with recipe

Easy, delish recipe. I didn't find celery seed and put zucchini in it with the carrots and onion. The dumplings seemed a bit dry so I added some water and sour cream till the mix was wetter and dough-like. I took liberties and put thyme and sweet marjoram in with the herbs, instead of celery seed. This was a great recipe to use!

I was in a hurry so used canned cooked chicken to decrease the cooking time and frozen homemade turkey broth (1.5 pints because that's what I had). Added a small bag of mixed frozen vegetables and decreased the dumpling recipe by 1/2 to decrease the carbs - Fantastic and will certainly be making it again!!

My family loved this dish!  The recipe says serves 4, but really it only served 3 people.  Next time I will double it and add carrots and corn like the picture shows.

So easy and so fantastic! I doubled the soup and broth, added cooked carrots and peas,  dropped in refrigerated biscuits at the end. A very forgiving recipe when having to run in and out to pick up and drop off kids! Love love love this one.

Made this for dinner tonight even though still warm outside was craving chicken and dumplings. Made this as per the recipe adding some Italian spice, sea salt and pepper. Added the cream of chicken soup and milk for the last 1/2 hr with the peas. Turned out amazing and I normally do not do well making dumplings but they also turned out great. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I cooked a whole chicken last night, so I used the leftover breast meat for this recipe tonight. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I was hesitant about the celery seed, but I liked it. I just like poultry seasoning in my chicken and dumplings too. So I will add that next time. I usually make rolled dumplings and prefer them, but these drop dumplings turned out very good. In fact, this is the first drop dumpling I have liked at all. Very good comfort food tonight.

Liked this recipe. Very simple and easy to make. However I did make a few adjustments to make it more like we wanted.  My husband nor I like celery so I replaced that with a can of VegAll.  I also replaced the celery seed with fennel which added a little heat to the dish but not spicy.  Loved how the dumplings turned out! They were the perfect amount of chewy that we love in a good dumpling!

My family loved it! I used a mixture of diced (2) chicken breasts & (4)thighs, added a can each of cream of chicken & celery and covered with chicken broth. I added a cup each of frozen corn, frozen peas, diced celery, diced onion, 1/4 tsp celery seed & about 5 dashes of poultry seasoning, then stirred everything together into the slow-cooker.  At the end, I used another recipe for dumplings and added those by the spoonful into the last 1/2 hour of cooking

Super easy recipe that comes out delicious. However, it needs double the liquid than in the original recipe. I followed the recipe exactly (aside from adding the celery) and by the time I was finished putting the dumplings in, there was barely any of the soup/gravy left. I ended up putting half water half milk until it created a bit more gravy enough to where I like it. Next time, I'll add an extra can of broth because there simply wasn't enough liquid. It tasted amazing though, but unfortunately the chicken did get a little toasty towards the end due to there not being enough liquid.

I made a few changes.  Boiled chicken thighs with skins and bones to make my own broth.  Add about a tablespoon of sea salt and just enough water to cover the chicken.  Strain broth before using.  Didn't make the low fat version and it was loaded with flavor.  Added carrots and peas.  Love the dumplings.  I've always hated dumplings, but really like these.  Fluffy, not pasty.

This is DELICIOUS!  After reading other reviews I omitted the celery seed and added a bay leaf and  a hearty dash of poultry seasoning. My husband, who is not a big fan of chicken and dumplings, went back for seconds.

This is almost perfect. I double the milk and broth in the soup and season the chicken with a bit of thyme. If I have some, I'll toss in a carrot or two as well. I also find it much easier to eat if I cut the chicken into cubes rather than strips.

Since I add more liquid, I do 1 1/2 batches of the dumplings as well.

Absolutely a success!  Used leftover turkey and chicken, obviously did not have to cook it quite as long, added a bit of chopped carrot, and added some parsley and sugar to dumplings....be careful, dumplings at least double in size when cooked!

Fantastic recipe!!  I also doubled the recipe.  Add peas and Emerils essence and it made it pop even more!  I also took the advice from the previous reviews and included the poultry seasoning to the broth and thickened with starch. For the dumplings I added the parsley for color. Thank you!

This was my first attempt at dumplings and I will make them again!!! Instead of canned soup I used my leftover gravy from Thanksgiving with the chicken broth. I did forget the celery seed but it was not missed.

Super delicious and easy to make. However, there is very little liquid when you're trying to feed multiple people. When I make this next time, I'm doubling the liquid.

it is a very simple recipe it is nice it is easy only thing I don't like about it is that there was not enough liquid you have to use two cans of that mixture to give you the two cans and there are enough dumplings are more than enough you need it but don't need a tablespoon use a teaspoon

I added a lot to this, based off other reviews, but wow, this was delicious!
I used chicken thighs, added a clove of garlic when sautÃ©ing, added 3 handfuls of frozen carrot/pea/bean mix, poultry seasoning and 2 bay leaves when simmering. So good! I also agree that this doesn't make enough liquid. I used about 20 oz of chicken stock, too, but I will double the soup & broth when making it again. My husband and 20 month old toddler both ate as much as they could handle.

I have never eaten chicken and dumplings, let alone, I've never cooked it either. However, my husband mentioned how much he likes chicken and dumplings. So I decided to cook it. He absolutely loved it! I also ate it, and it was very tasteful. The recipe was very easy to follow as well. I did make one change. I did not have any cream of chicken soup, therefore I used heavy cream. I also added carrots. Major hit!!!

I love chicken and dumplings and have used this recipe several times. Tonight I made it again following the recipe exactly and forgot to make a few changes. The entire amount of celery seed is too much- it makes the soup bitter. I usually add half the amount. When making the dumplings, make sure they're sticky wet and drop actual spoonfuls into the soup to cook. Shaping them with your fingers will lead to dense, dry centered dumplings. I always add some potatoes and carrots in addition to the onion and celery. Yum!

This is my go-to dumpling recipe so far. Review is only for the dumplings. I haven't tried the recipe for the chicken-y soup/stew part, since I prefer not to use canned cream soup if I can avoid it.

Made the dumplings, the texture was perfect. When I first put them in the pot, I thought "oh no it's not enough!" And made some more, only to find the first batch had already started fluffing pretty big. So, for those who did what I did thinking the dough wasn't enough, it totally is, just give it a minute. Sooooo delicious!!

This was my first time attempting Chicken and Dumplings.  This recipe was easy to follow and came out great!  It has just the right amount of creaminess for me without being too rich.  I followed someone's suggestion about making sure the dough batter was moist and sticky, so I had to add a splash more milk just to be on the safe side.  I also added some carrots. We will be adding this to our list of regular meals!

This was very easy and turn out great. I did cheat as I had a roasted chicken left over so I shredded what I had . I cooked onion and celery with a slice of garlic as directed. As the onion garlic and celery were sautÃ©ing. I added the chicken stock, cream of chicken and what I had left over from my homemade chicken gravy in Dutch oven on stove simmering. Threw all together and added 1/2 pkg of frozen green beans and then dumpling before serving. Thank  you for your idea!

Really yummy!  I tweaked the recipe a bit to personal taste.  I added 2 cans rather than 1 of cream of chicken soup, and sautÃ©ed mushrooms and garlic with the onion.  Also added a sprig of rosemary while the chicken was cooking, then removed it before adding the dumplings.  I was out of celery so I used carrots & some frozen mixed veggies, and it turned out nicely!  Will definitely make again!

I cooked it in a crock pot on low for 8 hours. And the last 30 minutes placed the refrigerated biscuits on top and coverd. I also added corn starch. We like our thicker. It was great! My favorite yet.

Thank you!!! After 16 years of trying to make chicken and dumplings like my mother in law, my husband says I have nailed it!! This recipe was the winner after so many years of coming up short with others. I actually wanted to use leftover turkey in freezer (legs and wings) so I doubled the soup and broth added the turkey and doubled the dumplings. I put in poultry seasoning, pepper, onion and garlic seasoning. Added peas. Almost like a chicken pot pie. I will make this again and again!! Looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Made this tonight. My first attempt at chicken & dumplings, and I thought it was really good. Next time I will use low sodium soups, and add some carrots, peas & seasonings to dumplings. But, other than that, I will be making this again!

This was excellent. I added carrots, potatoes, and more celery to make it a little heartier and it was absolutely fabulous. Great the next day too after the flavors had meshed together. Will definitely be making again soon!

Perfect comfort food for a chilly October night.  I modified the recipe using organic chicken thighs for more flavor, also added chopped carrots, and sautÃ©ed the chicken separate from the veggies before adding to the stew.    Next time I'll follow other's suggestions of adding more broth/cream of chicken soup.

Very easy recipe to make and will make again.

Excellent! Added carrots, cumin, garlic powder, herbs de province, doubled the soup and broth. Thought it was slightly too salty, so next time I will make sure to use low sodium. Really good though!

Very good.  Not difficult. Will make again and when I do the only thing I will make sure is to chop the chicken up more.  I also added carrots and mushrooms and garlic. Oh, and the dumplings expand, I made another batch because I thought it wouldn't be enough and when I went to put them in the top was covered.

I made this for my boyfriend and he said it was ok. He's a very picky eater though so it doesn't surprise me. This was his first time eating chicken & dumplings too.

This recipe is hands down the best chicken and dumplings recipe on this site.. Ive tried down the list from highest to lowest and so far this one is going to be the keeper.  I added extra chicken broth as suggested and it came out just right. not too much liquid, just right.  I didnt have celery seed so i didnt add it but i did add carrotts and it was DELICIOUS!!! thanks for this one!

I adore this recipe.  I've made a few changes though.  I add an extra can of cream of chicken, doubled up on the milk and add 1 and 1/2 cans of chicken broth.  I also add poultry seasoning and 2 bay leaves while cooking chicken, carrots(I added those)celery.  I eliminated onions.  It just doesn't seem to fit this recipe.  I changed nothing with the dumplings. I make  this recipe all the time and give it to whoever wants it telling them that I found it here.  Thank you Linda.

Dumplings were great. They are actually a recipe that I have made several times. As far as the Chicken stew, this was very very bland. It made alot and is now just sitting in the fridge. Not sure I even want to eat it again. Maybe I can add a bunch of spices.

This recipe was amazing! My husband and I both loved it and it was easy to make. I made a few changes. I added an extra can of chicken  broth, 2 cloves of garlic, and a carrot, which I cooked w/ the celery and onion. I boiled the chicken breasts in the broth for 15 minutes and then shredded the chicken and added it back into the soup right before I added the dumplings. We prefer the shredded chicken in a soup. I will definetely make this again.

Since my boyfriend has a cold, I decided to make this for us for dinner and no regrets at all.  He thought it was very tasty.  So do I.  As others suggested, I doubled up the sauce mixture and added carrots and peas.  Will keep this recipe for a time. Thanks for sharing.

Loved this!  I used thyme instead of celery seed because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a diced carrot and some frozen peas.  The tip of dipping the dumpling spoon into the broth to help it slide off worked perfectly.

I loved it! I am a college student, and we take turns cooking for the 3 of us in the apartment. The dumplings came out huge, so next time I will probably halve that. I also doubled the cream of chicken soup and chicken broth. We used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The ingredients says chicken breast halves, so I'm not sure if that's what I did or not, but nonetheless, everything came out proportional :)  It also took me 1 and a half hours from start to finish, but that may be because I'm not pro :)  Thanks, and I'm sure we'll be having it again soon! 5 stars!

This was awesome, perfect comfort food! I also added carrots and potatoes, and I doubled the broth. I also replaced the celery seed with dried thyme, which gave it a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Awesome.  I'd never had or made chicken and dumplings but I suddenly got the urge and used this recipe.  I followed the advice of a few reviewers and used cream of chicken and mushroom, added slicd muschrooms and carrots, and used green onion.  The dumplings were great and the liquid at a great consistency.  I did add about 1/3 a cup of water before dropping the dumplings because the liquid had reduced quite a bit.  Turned out fabulously.

This was very good comfort food for a cold day!  My husband just kept saying "MMM".  I took the advice of others and doubled the broth and cream of chicken to make it more of a soup, which went a lot further with 5 people (we still had leftovers).   I also added carrots, which gave it some color and some more veggies for the kids.   I did not use low sodium broth because I didn't have it on hand, and that was unfortunate because it was too salty with the regular broth.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I giving this 3 star overall but 5 stars for the dumpling recipe. I've made this chicken stew and I was'nt impress very bland and there are better just as easy recipe for chicken dumpling. But the dough recipe is by far the fluffiest and light tasting and I used this several time with my own chicken stew.

The only thing missing is more vegetables - I increased onion to 1/2 cup, mushrooms (1/2 cup sliced and saute'd with the onion and celery) and added carrots (1/2 cup shredded, stirred in just before step 4 - I dislike mushy carrots). The dumplings were perfect!  I have used chopped up leftover rotisserie chicken instead of starting from raw chicken, only sauteing the vegetables and adding the chicken later - and only simmered long enough to mix up the dumpling batter.  That saves lots of time and still is tasty.

This is one of my favorite comfort foods. My mom and grandma used to make this all the time. I never bothered because I thought it was too complicated but I made this today and loved it. I accidently used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I omitted the celery because I dont care for it too much and added frozen peas and carrots. I also used precooked fajita chicken instead. It is absolutely delicious even with the mistake of using cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for such a quick, easy, and delicious recipe!

I use this recipe for the dumpling portion only. I love the dumplings. I don't care for a chicken gravy that is made out of canned soups. So I just make my own stew and use the dumpling recipe.

I followed some of the other suggestions. In addition to the ingredients, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, carrots, and potatoes. I like a thicker soup so I also added corn starch to my liking. Otherwise, I followed the cooking instructions and it was fantastic.

Great basic recipe; add items or spices if you like. I added some white wine while sauteeing the onion and celery. Family loved this and will make again but will at least double the recipe to have some left overs.

My fiance loved this recipie! I made my own alterations, of course. I made my own broth, added some chopped baby carrots and yellow bell pepper. I sprinkled a dash of cumin and marjoram over the broth as it was simmering. It turned out very well! Thanks for your addition.

Good recipe. Very simple. Made it in winter, on a cold, rainy Sunday.  It was a perfect meal.  The dumplings were perfect & delicious.

I gave this recipe three stars; 3 for the soup and NONE for the dumplings.  I tried this recipe twice and will deleting it from my box after this.  The soup tastes...well, like chicken soup.  Nothing spectacular.  My family prefers my own recipe.  The dumplings disintegrated into the soup and turned the broth into cloudy!  It didn't affect the taste much, but I will definately be keeping my own recipe and pitch this one.

This was a tasty dish.  I used another can of broth and a cup of water.  I wanted more servings out of it.  I used my left over roasted chicken from the night before.  The dough was perfect and very easy to make.  If you are not using the extra water and broth it yields a lot of dough.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is the spices.  My man had to add spices while eating it, but he loves spicy things.

This recipe is great! I made a few changes. Didn't have cream of chicken soup on hand, so i made my own. Boiled 2 cut up chicken breasts  and 1 bay leaf in 3 c. salt water for 30 mins. Then i made a base for the soup in a sauce pan: I added chopped garlic to 3TB melted butter, sauteed 2 mins and added 2 handfuls of flour. Stirred flour/butter mixture for 2 mins and then added the water from the cooked, boiled chicken. Stirred well to get rid of lumps. Ta da! Cream of chicken soup!! Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

This recipe was just ok.  The taste was pretty good, but when following the recipe as stated, I ended up with the liquid base almost all dried up and burning onto the bottom.  Also after eating it, I felt extremely full for hours afterwards and I only ate half a plate.

I would just like to say that I am so thankful for finding this "homemade" dumplin' recipe.  After looking at a few of the higher rated recipes, and finding only 'canned' biscuits as a dumplin staple, I am fabulously satisfied with how this turned out.  My dumplins are light, huge, and fluffy, and taste fabulous.  Great addition to our "comfort food" menu.  Oh, and Bud Light really helps lubricate the cooking muscle. ;)

I added some garlic powder, a little black pepper, fresh oregano and rosemary when I cooked the chicken and onions. I added extra milk and about 3/4 cup of water because the reviews said there wasn't enough sauce, but I ended up with a lot left. The most disappointing thing was how dense the dumplings were, though. I'm going to look for a new dumpling recipe, but the rest of the recipe was very nice.

This was excellent!  I omitted the celery and added 2 carrots and 2 potatoes (chopped into small bites).  I LOVE the dumplings in this recipe.  They are the best I have ever had.  My husband (who usually makes the dumplings in our house) was so impressed by my 'skills'!  Thanks!

This was great!  I need to add some more milk and oil to the dough to get it to the right consistency.  Also, I didn't have celery but had green bell pepper that i needed to get rid of, so I add them to the oil, onions and chicken.  I never really noticed them when we were eating it, but the flavor was great!  Also, I didn't have cream of chicken so I just substituted cream of mushroom and threw in an extra boullion cube.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will definiley make again!!!

Absolutely yummy. A very tasty easy recipe which was easy and quick to make, yet looks amazing.  I took Rebecca70111's advice on how to make dumplings, and they came out perfect! First time I had ever tried to make dumplings! Thank you Linda and thank you Rebecca.

Wow, I'll never go back to dumplings made from store-bought baking mix again!  I used a cream of mushroom soup and didn't have celery seed, but didn't really care.  It was absolutely delicious without.  The dumplings were very light and fluffy.  I liked the addition of celery and onion and may add carrots to the mix next time.  I'm definitely adding this to my recipe box.

Really good and easy recipe... which is the perfect combination. I don't really like working with whole chicken so this is exactly the kind of chicken and dumpling recipe I was searching for. You get the flavor of a simmered-for-hours chicken stock base without the trouble. I followed some other reviewers suggestions: I cooked my chicken breasts with 4 cups of water and some bouillon (I didn't have canned stock on hand); I used two cans of cream soup (one chicken, one celery... next time I think I'll try mushroom); and I added some extra seasonings (thyme, basil, etc). I can't imagine the recipe with the original one can of soup and one can of stock... I think it would be too dry and I like my chicken and dumplings saucy! That's the only thing that keeps my rating at 4. But with the extra liquid... it's a 5 easy! Also... I added sliced carrots to sneak in some more veggies for my family. I think it makes it a little more complete. This will be on the dinner table again... and again...

This was the first time that I've ever made chicken and dumplings before, and this was a wonderful recipe to start with! I made a few changes to the recipe that I think made it even better, hence the reason I rated it only four stars instead of five.   I doubled the cream of chicken, chicken broth, and milk so there would be more broth. I also added 1/2 cup of carrots to the veggies, and I seasoned the vegetables and chicken with a garlic and herb seasoning while I cooked them in skillet. I also added some rosemary and basil to the broth after adding the chicken and veggies. While making the dumplings, I followed what one of the reviewers said and made sure the dough was wet and sticky before dropping it in the broth. They came out nice and fluffy, although they had a weird flavor, which I recognized as the olive oil that I used in the dough. Next time I am going to use vegetable oil instead. I will also cut the chicken into smaller pieces, as I would've preferred smaller chunks in the broth.   All in all, the end result was delicious and I will definitely be making this recipe again! A great dinner for a cold winter evening!!!

I wanted to try and make Chicken Dumplings because my dad loves them and he hasn't had a good recipe in a while. I came a cross this recipe, which was perfect. I had everything on the list, except celery (which didn't really  matter since no one in my family likes it). Anyways this recipe was awesome, it tastes amazing! I would make this recipe again!

I had some broth I wanted to use up so I only made the dumpling part of this recipe. Previously I have only made Jiffy Mix dumplings and I wanted to make them from scratch this time to see if it would be any more difficult. I was very happy to find that it was as easy as it seemed in this recipe to make them.
Edit: I have since made the entire recipe not just the dumpling part and it really is an excellent recipe. I am changing my rating to 5 stars!

This recipe is great.  I just made a few minor changes per the recommendations of others who had tried it before me.
I added 3/4 c of carrots chopped, cut out the celery seed. I also doubled the cream of chicken soup and broth to 2 can of each to make it more soup like.
My family loved it, I will definitely be making this again!

I used three carrots, three Celery Stalks and One medium onion, all diced small. I threw in a shot of real sherry near the end for a richer flavored finished and made 1 and 1/2 as many dumplings (which were excellent). Still not crazy about using canned soups as starters but until I find a scratch recipe that can match this one, I am sticking with this one.

We really enjoyed making this using a new crock pot. I sauted the celery and onion in a little bacon grease before putting them in the pot with the other ingredients. I doubled just about everything and added some poultry seasoning, thyme and rosemary to the broth.  I have to admit I did cheat and used refrigerated biscuits cut in half for our "dumplings" and let them steam in the pot the last 1/2 hour.  This was easy and tasty!

i tried this recipe the way it's written and it just didn't have much flavor. this was good with my changes. dumplings were very bland even after adding dill to them so i threw them out and I ended up making a stew out of it by adding to the celery some fresh sliced mushrooms, sauteed carrots, garlic, extra onion and some frozen peas.  used regular cream of chicken soup and added some cream along with the milk then wine to to taste to the sauce. served over noodles.  completely changed the recipe but didn't like it the way it was written... sorry

This is a great recipe for those watching calories.  It does not taste low fat at all!!!  I usually add more vegetables in it, like carrots, peas, etc to make it more of a meal. Oherwise iIfollow directions exactly.  Dumplings are tasty too!

My husband and I love this one.  I usually end up omitting the celery.  Also, I swap out the celery SEED for celery SALT.  Delicioso!

This recipe turned out great even though I didn't do the less fat suggestions. Also, to give it some extra vegetables I poured in about a cup of frozen peas and carrots which made it seem more like a full meal.

I make this quite often. My kids love it. I add some frozen peas/carrots and use chicken broth instead of water (if I have it). It's always a hit.

Very good.  I did 3 frozen chicken breasts and simmered them in enough chicken stock to cover until done.  Then shredded the chicken and put it back in.  Then instead of the can of soup, I added left over cream sauce I made (for pasta the night before;reduced chicken stock, butter, little flour, cream/half&half).  I sauted the celery and onions, (added) carrots and added to the pot.  Add a little extra milk to the dumpling dough, the come out nicely if you make them extra sticky. Great flavor...even leaving out the celery seed which I didn't have.

I have been making this recipe for about 2 yrs now and love it!  I have tweaked it a bit for my family.  I don't add the oil in the skillet in the beginning and I use about half the amount of chicken breast; I also put more celery and add chopped carrots to the broth.  I have used ground turkey breast and leftover turkey meat in place of the chicken before and it always turns out fabulous!

Ok so I admit, I used this recipe as a base for my leftovers.  I had some thyme roasted chicken and vegetables (celery,potatoes, carrots and onion)to use up from the night before.  I also used cream of mushroom soup because thats all I had.  I mixed the liquids with a bit more broth and added the leftover veggies and chicken and brought to a boil.  I added the dumplings and cooked till done and wow such an easy and economical dish that my husband described as "rich" and it was a total hit.  So though I modified the recipe this was a great base recipe that I will keep.

If I could rate this a 0 I would. I doubled my liquids due to being concerned about the dumplings drying it all out. That didn't even matter because once I dropped the dumplings in, it soaked all of the liquid up & started burning the bottom. Overall, the celery seed was way too over powering & the overall taste was scorched. Will ever make again!

This was my first go at Chicken and Dumplings - I made it for my boyfriend who had never tried it before... he LOVED it. It turned out really great. I feel like I'll try playing with the recipe, maybe adding some more veggies in the future, but it is really great as is.

Comfort food at its best!  I added extra milk and oil after mixing the dumpling batter (in order to get it wet and sticky, as someone else had mentioned) and they turned out great.

This was my first time making chicken and dumplings.  It was amazing! Everything turned out fantastic. The dumplings were great. The flavor was superb. I did add extra cream of chicken soup because I thought it was too thick. I will make this again and share the recipe with my friends and family.

The soup itself was good, but the dumplings were awful. They were doughy and very very dense. I made sure not to over mix the dough and cooked them for the full 15 min just as instructed, so I'm not sure what happened. I ended up cooking up some Bisquick dumplings and serving them over the soup instead, which was much better!

This is a excellent recipe. So easy to add or delete for your family tastebuds. When in a hurry, I debone a deli chicken and splash some of the juices from it in the gravy, Yum, yum!

We are eating this as I type - it is really good, however we made a couple changes.  Added 3 chopped carrots, and next time we would double the amount of celery.  Also, be careful with the chicken broth - is plenty salty as is, and probably would dilute it with some water.  Other than that, delicious!!!!  Okay - time to eat :)

This is real chicken and dumplings!! It's very easy to modify to meet your personal tastes. We added more veggies and cut out the cerely seed. I doubled the chicken/gravy recipes and QUADRUPLED the dumpling recipe. We have a family of 6, 5 that eat solids, and this was very filling and provided plenty of leftovers that reheat really well!

This CD recipe turned out creamy and delish! If you follow the directions on the back of the can on how to make it as soup it works out just fine...it thickens as it cooks with the dough. Half water (or chicken broth) half milk, wah-lah!

I've been using this recipe for years, and my family loves it.  For some time saving, I sometimes cheat by using ready-made dough.  Still tastes great!  Oh, and I always add some garlic--whole cloves--for the simmer.  Yum!

I only used the dumpling part of this recipe with my own home made chicken soup and they were excellent! I just added a bit of garlic powder and some pepper, since that is what my family prefers, but the dumplings were the best I have ever made. Thanks so much for the super recipe.

One of my all time favorite comfort foods. Preparing and eating this brought back memories of Grandma's kitchen! This recipes is great, just add in more veggies to your own liking. I always add a small amount of chives to my dumplings.
Thanks for a great recipe...

A good recipe, but needed way more veggies and one more can of soup. Next time I'm going to add peas, carrots, and potatoes. Also, I didn't use the dumpling recipe as I already had my own. So I don't know how the dumplings are.

My husband requested this recipe for Father's Day.  I have never made chicken and dumplings before.  This was so easy and so yummy !  I did make a few modifications to make it my own.  Added chopped carrots and fresh chopped sage to the dumpling batter.  I will definately make this again.

My 13 yr. old LOVES chicken and dumplings. It's all she orders when we go to Cracker Barrel. I decided to make this dish for her. She loved it and so did I. I added carrots to mine and used less celery than the recipe called for.  I sauteed the veggies and then seared the chicken before I cooked it through. Next time I will use more chicken broth and soup. (I like mine a little soupier.) And I think I will use Bisquick next time. Believe it or not, I like my dumplings the way my mom used to make 'em - doughy!

very flavorful. i 2x the pepper and added 1/4c of water to the broth before adding chicken and dumplings. soup to dumpling/chicken is thick, i'll add more liquid next time. very easy. also my dumpling mixture was a little dry so i added more milk to give it a gloppier  (lighter) look. turned out perfect!!

This was a great recipe! My husband and I loved it. Next time I would cut the chicken into smaller bites to make it easier to eat, but other than that... it was perfect!

Awesome! I have been trying to change the way I cook lately...making things a little more healthy. It is low in fat without sacrificing flavor. It is very flavorful. My boys loved it. I didn't change a thing in the recipe! Great the way it was. I was wondering if instead of using white flour you could use weat flour for the dumplings to give it added health benefits??

Amazing. Easy and tasty. I made my dumplings teaspoon size instead of tablespoon. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is so easy and so good!  Made a few changes, I left out the chopped onion and celery since my teenage kids won't eat anything with chopped onion or celery, and used 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (Out of sight, out of mind!). I cut the celery seed to 1/2 teaspoon and added 2 teaspoons dried parsley. I added another can of chicken broth since we like lots of broth in our chicken and dumplings.  I also added a cup of frozen mixed veggies. My family ate it up, no leftovers! Awesome recipe!

This came out WONDERFUL. Because I used a whole (cut-up) chicken, I added a large can of cream of mushroom soup, 4 cans of low-sodium chicken broth, water and a little extra milk. When it came time to add the dumplings, I added corn and green beans.  Let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then I added the dumplings, which I seasoned with a little parsley.

Excellent!!!

For low-fat, pretty yummy. Verrrry easy! Next time, I'll boil the chicken to make it more tender and experiment with seasonings as the sauce was too bland(I did halve the celery seed, though). Personally, I liked the dumplings big!

This recipe was VERY good. I had to make a few changes to it though, I used about 1/4 cup more broth, and did not have any cream of chicken soup, only cream of mushroom. It still came out great. The dumplings were really big and I'll use 1/2 tablespoons of batter next time. THANKS!

I made this using two cans of cream of chicken soup and left out the onion. It came out way too salty, probably my fault as i can't remember if the chicken broth was low sodium or not. i'm going to try this again with just one can of cream of chicken and make sure i have the right broth.the dumplings were great!!

Great recipe and very easy.  Did double the chicken soup and added frozen peas and carrots at the very end.  May add a little more chicken broth next time as the gravy became a little thick after the dumplings cooked.  Will definitly make again.

This was pretty good!  The chicken stew itself wasn't as fantastic as I'd hoped, and if I make it again, I'll make some changes to it.  When I made this, I added carrots (which I won't do next time because I think they made it too sweet), and I boiled the chicken separately, then cut it into bite sized pieces and put it in the soup.  I also added some thyme and sage.  I'd recommend grinding the celery seed a bit with a mortar and pestle because I couldn't really taste the celery seed, even though I put in half again as much as the recipe said.  The stew part tasted pretty good, but was nothing fantastic because I think it didn't have much depth of flavor.  The dumplings were GREAT though!  I loved them!  I added a bit of dried parsley to them, and they were the best!  I'll definitely make them with any future stews!  So this recipe was definitely worth trying, if only for the dumplings! :o)

I tried to find a recipe close to my grandmothers because i LOVED her chicken and dumplings. I made this for my husband and daughter, and they were screaming for more before i even had a chance to sit down! The only thing i did different was make my own chicken broth from Boullion cubes. It gave it a certain something. i also added a second can of cream of chicken soup (condensed and unmixed with water) It made it EXTRA thick, which at first i thought was a mistake but my husband while rubbing his expanding belly says it was the best meal i'd ever made. Thanks for the recipe! We're hooked!

This dish brought back childhood memories of my mom's chicken and dumplings.  It really is a great comfort food!  I cut the chicken into large bite sized chunks and added sliced carrots and fresh garlic.  In place of celery seed, I used Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning.  Next time, I'll probably try adding fresh parsley to the dumplings as suggested by others.  This one's a keeper.

My whole family thought this was fantastic. I didn't have any celery seed so just omitted it and all tasted fine. Not sure what we were missing but we just added pepper and chowed down. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made this a year ago (first time making chick & dumps) and it came out perfect and delicious.  I added a chicken bouillon cube and some dried thyme, and I also used celery salt instead of celery seed, although another reviewer said it made hers too salty.   We boiled chicken thighs first instead of using chicken breasts.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I can only rate the dumplings... I used them on top of a beef stew I was making.  They are the lightest, fluffiest dumplings ever!  I will try the chicken part next time.
