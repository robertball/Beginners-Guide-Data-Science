This recipe is always a family favorite for the holidays. I usually make a kid friendly batch, then one for the adults with rum added. Every year I'm asked to make this. I'd say its a hit.

Good recipe but too sweet as written. I eliminated the sugar and it was perfect. Every guest loved it. I added whole allspice for added flavor.
