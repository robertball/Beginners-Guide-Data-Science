this recipe only serves as a guideline for me, but it's very helpful. I personally leave out the coconut flakes every time i bake these cookies, and i always add 1 or 2 teaspoons of milk into the batter. I like my cookies soft, and the milk and minimum baking time does the trick.

This recipe had good flavor and helped me perfect my own peanut butter cookie recipe. HOWEVER. No matter what I did the ingredients in the amounts given resulted in flat spread out cookies that were not soft the next day. The coconut is awesome. Hint: use more peanut butter and flour. I also recommend adding a little vanilla.=)

I made a batch of these, thinking they would be nice to have on the counter for a snack.  In three hours, the entire batch was gone...that's what happens when you live with boys, I guess!!  They said they were the best p.b. cookies EVER!

One of the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted.  The only bad point is that they're addictive and fattening...but who cares about that?!

This recipe is ok as it is, however the cookies come out very flat and a little crunchy.  I add 1/2 cup of flower, and 1/2 cup of peanut butter, then cook at 350 for 10 min.  This makes for a light soft and VERY tasty cookie!

I didn't mean to add anything to an already perfect recipe, but I couldn't resist using crunchy peanut butter and adding a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels... and it still came out to be a 5-star favorite in our home!  So easy and so good -- with or without the morsels -- completely different tastes but both so perfect!

These were great, but I found 375 to be too high.  The first batch burned and I only had them in for 10 min, but the seond batch came out perfect and I cooked them for 12 min at 350.  They had a perfect consistency and just the right amount of peanut butter and sweetness flavor.  I did add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey to the batter.

I found that the dough was a little too soft (dough needs to be tight and shiny) for cookies and while they turned out okay, I prefer a buttery, chewy cookie.  MIne turned out too soft, kind of big and just not as flavorful as I had hoped. I probably should have used crunchy peanut butter.  Maybe I will try it again and alternate some of the ingredients.

This cookie batter is so good that I only made one batch of actual cookies and ate the dough for the rest of the week! Since I like my cookies soft, I took the advice of other posters and used half brown sugar and half maple syrup.  I also added some baking powder and milk and increased the pb.  Then I baked for 12 mins at 350.  The only thing I will change for next time will be to add more coconut.  Fantastic!

I lost my old peanut butter cookie recipe so I used this one. I was disappointed. These cookies  came out too crispy for my tastes - I would have preferred something chewier. Also, the dough was not very thick so I couldn't put the traditional fork lines on the cookie. (Little things like that mean something to me.) All in all, it was just a mediocre cookie, not great but certainly not bad. I won't use this recipe again.

I used a similar recipe. I made the following substitutions - Instead of rolling the balls in coconut flakes, I used confectionary sugar. Instead of brown sugar I used maple syrup. I also baked them on a stone. I baked them for appx. 13-14 minutes on 350. They came out perfect and stayed soft. Any thoughts if this was caused by the maple syrup?

I added extra salt and a splash of vanilla.  I baked them in my little convection oven for 12 minutes and they came out really nice, slightly browned edges,and just slightly underdone.  They were excellent.  The coconut is a nice touch, barely noticed it was there, but added some nice texture.  Next time I'd like to top with some whole peanuts for extra texture and taste.

These were okay not alot of pb flavor and you couldn't taste the coconut at all which was why I tried this recipe. I also found these to be really greasy and the next day really crunchy. I prefer mine to be soft in the middle. Overall it was ok but I don't think I would make them again.

I don't know what everybody is doing wrong because these cookies are just perfect the way they are.  If you don't like coconut than try another recipe that is designed without it, obviously this recipe was not meant to ommit it so of course they would be crunchy.  I always use parchment paper when making cookies, there's nothing like baking with it so maybe that would be of some help. And also make sure to use high quality peanut butter, cheap stuff will make it taste just that. Using a medium scoop to make larger cookies also works well.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe!

These are the best pb cookies I have ever tasted. I added some baking powder and used more peanut butter so they didn't turn into flat pancakes and had much more flavour.  The coconut is awsome.  Please give it a try before you omit it.

They were thin and sweet, maybe three quarters on the sugars. I made them without the coconut.  The next time I will go with three quarters on the brown sugar and three quarters on some splenda instead of white sugar.  they were good; I ate two of them immediately.  I could get fat off these cookies, but I'm going to restrain myself to two a day.

I thought these were just okay, kind of flat and crispy even. My mom thought they were the best peanut butter cookie she has ever had though, I will compromise and give them a 4.

These cookies taste pretty good. They were a little on the crunchy side. The coconut makes them different from any peanut butter cookies I have had in the past.

These cookies came out okay, but I turned the heat down to 350.  My first batch burned and all the batches got flat and crispy.  It made a lot of cookies.  I topped mine with a chocolate drop.

I thought these cookies were great.  But the dough was a bit too soft.  I added more flour and left out the coconut.  They were wonderful still warm...

I used a little more peanut butter, chunky, and cooked 10-12 minutes at 375 for a chewier cookie.  Yummy!

This is a terrific cookie. I like crunchy cookies and when cooked a couple extra minutes they turn out perfectly crunchy.  I thought the coconut was a nice addition (the coconut makes it look like a nutty cookie).  A very buttery rich cookie.  My family loves them.

Super recipe.  The best peanut butter cookie I've made.  I used chunky peanut butter and only had 1/2 cup of coconut.  Also, I could only bake them 9 to 10 minutes.  Any longer would have been too much at 375.  They turned out perfect!

I ran short of sugar, and used some honey instead. I also used a little more coconut. The cookies came out great.

I didn't have any coconut, so I used what I had...Reese's Peanut Butter cups chopped and folded into the batter at the end.
Cookies turned out soft and absolutely yummy!

Super easy dough to work with, but I should have cooked the cookie is a little less. I ended up cooking them for 14 minutes, but they probably would have been fine if I had cook them for 13 minutes. I didn’t use the coconut, but I followed the recipe just as directed, but adding a little bit more peanut butter (to finish the jar).

This was the best peanut butter cookies my wife and I ever had. Very light. I made a couple small changes. I added 1 TBS vanilla, 3 TBS milk, and an extra cup of peanut butter. I also refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before I started baking. The cookies do spread out while baking so leave room. 8 minutes was enough cooking time. This recipe made 8 dozen. I can't wait to share these cookies with my kids and grandbabies. We will make this recipe often. Thank you.

Full of flavor.  I followed this recipe exactly with 2 exceptions.  I used chunky peanut butter and lowered the oven temp to 350.  They browned up perfect in 12 minutes. They turned out a little flatter than a typical pb cookie, but taste delicious. The coconut makes this recipe special.  Moist and full of flavor. I got 4 dozen big cookies.

Tried this recipe for the first time. The whole family loved them. I just had to rate this recipe again. Everybody that eats these cookies love them. The only thing that I leave out is the coconut. This is the only PB cookie that I make.

These cookies were a big hit!  Especially with my roommates who had never tried peanut butter before.  This recipe makes a lot of dough so I refrigerated the dough I didnt use, and made more mini-batches throughout the week.  I used chunky peanut-butter, and they were wonderful.

This recipe is awesome!!  My boyfriend is super picky about what he eats.  But he LOVES these cookies!!  Peanut butter cookies were always a favorite of his, but these are his favorite cookies-period!  The second time I baked them I doubled the peanut butter and the coconut.  I also made some with raisins and almonds for a good, different flavor and texture.  mMmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!  Thank you, I Love this site!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These were not good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the coconut and they came out fairly hard and flat.  The flavor was OK, but I prefer soft, chewy cookies.

First of all, the coconut has to go.  Not only did the coconut add zero flavor, it created an annoying texture.  If you decide to make this cookie, heed the advice of the reviewers and add more peanut butter.  The dough is a bit fluffy and the end result is a very soft, bland cookie (even with the added PB.)  The bake time needs to be adjusted as well.  I kept the recipe's temperature, only to bake them for over 20 minutes.  Will I make these cookies again?  Are you kidding?  No.

These cookies were good but nothing special.  The coconut is barely noticeable.  The first sheet was way too dry and very dark so I took Amanda B.'s recommendation and turned the oven down to 350º and did not bake over 12 mins.  That seemed about right.  They were more chewy.  I used a small ice cream scoop to make the job go quicker.  I was able to get 5 dozen cookies.

I think 12 minutes is way too long for these cookies, because mines got a bit burnt.  However, they were SO YUMMY!  Mines was in the oven too long, but even though it was a bit burnt, it was very crispy!  I used CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER and it adds a lot more flavor since it has actual peanuts.  This is one of those no-fault recipes :)  My whole family loves them, they loved them more than chocolate chip cookies!

Delicious recipe.  I left out the coconut and underbaked for a softer cookie.  Cooked one batch for the full time and it was crunchy and not as flavorful, but the ones I underbaked were great.  The only improvement I will make next time will be to use chunky peanut butter.

I baked these and carried them to work.  Everyone liked them.  I substituted Crunchy Peanut Butter for the Smooth and baked them only 8 to 9 minutes.  The edges were lightly browned.  They were chewy and delicous.  Very flavorful.  A delightful change to the standard Peanut Butter Cookie Recipe.  Thanks for sharing a very good recipe.

This recipe is great.  Peanut butter cookies are my favorite, and every time I get a hankering I log on and look up this recipe.  I leave out the coconut, and this last time we were out of brown sugar so I left it out, too, and they still tasted fine.  I love how quick it is, too!

Fast and easy!  Husband and kids loved them!  Left out the coconut and added a chocolate "kiss" in the middle.

The first peanut butter cookie recipe that is excellent.  I didn't even use the coconut if not wanted.
