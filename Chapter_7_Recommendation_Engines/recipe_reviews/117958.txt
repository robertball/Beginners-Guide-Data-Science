I found this recipe a few years ago in a magazine. It's become a family staple.  It's super easy and looks SO impressive.  We usually use strawberries.  It does work better to make this at least a few hours or the night before serving.  Chilling in the fridge helps to keep it set up.  Otherwise, it falls over easily once you start cutting pieces of cake.

Unbelieveably delicious. I brought it to a dinner party and people were in shock that 1. I made it. 2. It looked awesome. 3. It tasted THAT good. I was really strapped for time and was amazed that I could do it in the 55 minutes it suggests.

OMG This is absolutely DIVINE! I made it for my wedding anniversary and it was a hit! It doesn't take all day and it's a delicious, beautiful cake, perfect for a special occasion. I do recommend you give the cake a little loner to cool down. If you only wait 10 minutes it'll still be warm and when you slice it horizontally, it'll crumble. You may want to wait about an hour if you have the time and it'll cut easily and the presentation will be much neater and professional.

Easy to follow directions. It takes a while to make, however, the end result is defintely worth it.
*I added some raspberry jam to the bottom 3 layers.

Wow! This is sooo delicious. And really easy. Looks pretty too. I made this for Valentines Day/Anniversary. I made individual cakes because everyone had a different preference to the berries. Me and my son wanted raspberries and my hubby and other 2 kids wanted strawberries. Also another son wanted chocolate frosting. So I baked the cake in a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, then once the caked cooled I used a biscuit cutter to cut circles from the cake. I got 5 three layer tortes this way. Which was perfect everyone was happy and enjoyed this very much. Thank you for the recipe.

Very delicious.  Made it for a friend's birthday--without the pecans.  They were impressed with how "big" and how great it tasted.  Made it for my husband who suggested more cream, but loved it.  He took the other half to work with him and a colleague asked me to make this cake for his daughter and paid me $25 for it.  I used my husband's suggestion and added more of the cream mixture (so I added 1/2 to what was already called for).  His colleagues' father ran in to me (never talked to me before) and had to tell me how delicious this cake was.  This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is so great! The dinner party was amazed. I made the cakes in little four inch round pans, and they were so cute and looked so gourmet!

I struggle with rating this recipe because in reality, it is a boxed cake mix with slightly modified cream. Is that really a recipe?!   The first time I made this torte, all of my guests agreed that it would have been great if the nuts had been left out and if there was a more intense raspberry flavour. I now make it with cold Raspberry Sauce (from this site) and cream spread between each cake layer. The raspberry sauce adds wonderful flavour and fresh raspberries decorating just the top of the cake are more than enough.  It certainly is a way to dress up a standard cake mix as the end result (with the raspberry sauce) tastes completely home made.

This is delicious, easy and looks great. I made this for a girlfriend's birthday...my group of girlfriends and I LOVE the 'nuts and berries' after dinner drink (vodka, baileys, frangelico and chambord) so, I made it into a cake...I used a dark chocolate cake mix, made it following the directions, but using coffee instead of water and added hazelnut extract. I torted the cakes, and make a frangelico simple syrup that I put into a squirt bottle and squirted all over the cake...i added baileys to the filling and used fresh raspberries and the chambord component...EVERYONE complemented on its looks ( we brought it into a restaurant and other patrons kept ohhinh and ahhing and asking where we had ordered it from!!) and the taste was even better! the whole group  ( about 15) loved it!! I will definately be making this again!!

Cooked in a sheet cake pan and cut out with a round cookie cutter. Garnished with strawberries and chopped walnuts. My hubby loved it!

Cake needed to sit out a day before it tasted better. Not crazy about the pecan frosting but the family enjoyed it.

So good!  I use the Dark Chocolate Cake recipe from this site instead of the mix and I use strawberries instead, but it is still amazinging good and easier than it seems.  Don't over cook your cake and definitely trim the domed tops off your layers to get nice flat layers when you cut them in half.  The cream cheese filling is nice and light.  It's silky instead of fluffy but not too sweet.  Br sure to refrigerate this before serving for a few hours.  It gives the filling body and keeps it from being too messy.

Yummy! But mostly it LOOKED pretty & summery--and easy to make! I took it to a family birthday gathering & made the cake ahead of time. I forgot the raspberries so I substituted cherries on top only.  Pretty, but I think raspberries would be more delicious!  The whipped filling/topping was so tasty!!  I will be making again and following the recipe to a T!  Thanks for an easy but fancy looking cake!

It looks very impressive but I thought something was missing.  I think next time I'll double the cream cheese in the frosting.  I was also thinking of putting a raspberry sauce in the layers instead of raspberries and then garnishing with fresh raspberries on top.

This is my favorite cake to make for any occasion! People practically lose their minds when they first see it, and then again after tasting. I never add nuts, just a personal preference. I have made it with devil's food but it comes out better with a chocolatier cake mix, like Triple Chocolate or some such variation. Be really careful not to overcook the cake. And it is far far far better after its been refrigerated for at least six hours, adds more texture to the frosting. People assume that cream cheese frosting will be rich but the most common comment I receive is "it's so light!" Can't say how glad I am to have found this recipe.

Oh my God!  I made this?  Absolutely everything about this cake is wonderful; taste, presentation, easy to prepare.  The recipe calls for finely chopped pecans and I tend to think that bigger pieces are usually better than small ones, like in banana bread, but it really is best to finely chop the pecans in this recipe; bigger pieces are not as pleasant to eat in a cake.  I used 8" pans so my cakes were a bit thicker than with a 9" pan.  Because of this, I made a 3 layer cake and used what would have been the 4th layer to make mini cakes for my husband and I; I cut out rouds with a cookie cutter and made mini 2 layer cakes.  YUM!  I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks for this terrific recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used raspberry filling from a can to put between layers and then fresh raspberries on top as decoration.   The fresh raspberries were just too tart for my liking to have them throughout the cake.    It was fabulous!  Everyone loved it and wanted more. 2 notes to consider when making this cake  1). Make sure to buy good quality heavy whipping cream as the cheaper brands don't whip up and form peaks, it stays in a liquid form. 2). This cake will slide and fall if you don't have cake dowel rods to hold it all together and you plan to take it somewhere.   I will definitely make this again for special occasions.

I had fresh raspberries I picked from our garden and couldn't decide what to make with them. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. It was a hit! Everyone loved it, including me! I did decide to only do two layers instead of four. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Absolutely beautiful and delicious! I used strawberries instead of raspberries. My only suggestion would be to use less whipping cream... the recipe made a LOT of frosting, and the cream cheese taste was overwhelmed by the whipped cream. Otherwise, this was a Valentine's Day hit!

So good and so simple to make. Trimming the dome of the cake to be as flat as you can is key to good structure! It was gone in no time at all...definitely one to make again!

I love this cake! I made it for my husband's birthday and it was very impressive. The only change I made was that I used less chopped pecans in the filling and actually, I'll probably use even less next time I make it.

I had a bit of trouble with this, even though I assumed it was going to be a piece of cake. Unfortunately I ran out of time before the potluck, I dropped the icing on the floor, and the cake was hideous. I got lots of compliments on the wonderful taste though! What little I had leftover was eaten right away by my dormmates.

This cake was a HUGE hit! The ONLY thing i would do different next time is make a double batch of the filling.
