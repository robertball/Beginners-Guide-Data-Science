This is my favorite soup recipe. I used homemade stewed tomatoes (aprox 4 cups) and homemade chicken stock from leftover Rosemary chicken. I use all turkey sausage because i like it better. I also don't use frozen veggies. Instead I use fresh green beans and carrots. I don't precook the noodles either. I just toss in a couple of handfuls of raw pasta and let simmer until it's cooked.

This was my first time ever making soup.  It was fantastic.  I was worried about the flavor as I was making it but it was very flavorful.  The turkey sausage gave it the kick it needed.  I added extra kidney beans and an extra zucchini and feel that they might have absorbed more of the broth.  Could have used a bit more broth. Please note it makes a TON of soup.  I have already made lunch plans and have dished some out to the neighbors who loved it.

I made this for a Bunco party of 12 and it was a hit. Lots of raves. I stayed pretty close to the recipe using fresh carrots, celery, mushrooms, spinach, Zucchini and frozen green beans for the vegetables. I had to simmer a bit longer to cook the carrots. So carrots went in first and then the others according to how long they needed to cook. I used Acini Di Pepe for the macaroni. Thank you for the great recipe!

I changed NUMEROUS ingredients in this soup because I didn't have everything.  I DID follow the recipe for the soup base and this still came out really good. I am Italian and used to minestrone that's heavily tomato based in contrast to the more watery base of this soup. So, I didn't think it was going to be very good but was I pleasantly surprised! This is really very good and a soup that I will certainly be making again! Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty! I only had ground turkey, no sausage and it turned out just fine. I threw in a few frozen green beans also. I like to use white beans instead of kidneys. Top it w/ some parm. reggiano and it's super delicious! My 6 yr. old devoured it! It's a keeper recipe!!

made this tonite, added fresh baby artichokes, tons of other squash, chard (because it was here too), little star shaped pasta and it was so yummy! of course, made way too much for a single person with 1/2 a stomach. oh well. maybe it'll freeze?

Excellent flavor. My whole family loved it!  Used only turkey, dried parsley, diced tomatoes and carrots instead of frozen veggies.

This has fan-tastic flavor!! I had to substitute a few things because I didn't have everything on hand (all ground turkey instead of half turkey sausage, diced tomatoes instead of Italian stewed) and didn't have any parsley, but this was GREAT!! Definitely goes in the rotation. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I improvised a bit.  I used mild Italian pork sausage, instead of turkey.  I think I'd try the turkey next time as the the pork was almost too overwhelming.  I used 2 cans of plain diced tomatoes and I chopped pre-cooked fettucini pasta (I had leftover pasta from the night before).  I prefer fresh vegetables over frozen, so I chopped up approx. 3/4 cup of carrots, used 2 small zucchini, added approximately 8 oz. of spinach, and 2 stalks of celery slices.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce, just to give it a more tomato based broth.  To keep the soup from being too thick, I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of 6, and I also added approx. 10 cups of water.  With all of the fresh vegetables and the cooking time, the amount of water ended up being perfect - not too thick not too watery.  Overall, it was a good soup.  I'd definitely make it again, next time with turkey sausage though!

this was really good, but i did make a few changes. I used all chicken italian sausge. used garbanzo beans instead of kidney. Didn't buy mixed veggies, just eye balled green beans, carrots, zuchini, and chopped cabbage. added red wine instead of cider vinegar. Other than that it was amazing! :)

I made this today for lunch.  It was very flavorful and chocked full of yummy veges. (My husband and I are on South Beach Phase 1.)  I used turkey breakfast sausage and not the other meats, a little less broth, more kidney beans, regular diced tomatoes, and added tomato paste.  Everything else was the same.  I added the noodles to my kids' portion, but left them out of my husband's and mine.  It was delicious - even the kids said so (and they didn't even know there was celery in it...hahaha)!  So happy we have leftovers!

This is a GREAT recipe! I made a few minor changes due to preference. I used white beans instead of kidney (my kids wont eat kidney), I use fresh chopped carrots instead of the frozen veggies, and I use little star noodles. My husband loved it some much the first time that I had to make it again the next day for my extended family, where all I heard was that it was the, "best soup" they had. Complements to Betty!

Excellent broth flavor with turkey italian sausage. I used all fresh veggies, and thin-sliced potatoes instead of pasta. Also added a handful of barley. You have enough liquid when your ingredients are covered. Wonderful on a winters day!

Healthy and affordable!  Couldn't wait to try it.  I didn't have sausage so I only used ground turkey (go with you preference on this) I also didn't have fresh veggies (it is Jan in MI).  I used 1 bag of Italian style frozen veggies and about 1 cup frozen spinach and 1 can of mushrooms.  I also added 1 can of white beans, because I love beans in soup.   I also added more pasta because I like my soup to be less "soupy" again go with your preference.  Over all, this is a great, healthy soup that makes a ton of servings so make sure to use a big pot.

This soup was good. My family enjoyed it. I personally didn't like the Turkey Sausage. I think next time I will double the ground turkey and leave out the sausage.  This makes a lot of soup.

SO SO DELICIOUS! Did throw it all together, with the uncooked  pasta, and let it simmer for a while until it was all done. Just used a pound of ground turkey, no sausage. Didn't use frozen veggies, but fresh : yellow squash, chopped spinach, chopped carrots, mushrooms and green beans. MMMM... Will make this often this winter!

Yummy & satisfying! I used beef broth and fresh veggies, but pretty much followed the recipe from there.  One big addition was a tsp. of fennel seed to up the flavor of the sausage.  Loved this!! Thank you!
