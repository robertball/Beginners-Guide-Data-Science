I used Roma tomatoes in this recipe. After I diced them up, the amount looked quite small before I even folded in the other ingredients. I diced up four more and that looked right to me. I did not use a full red onion, just half. I did not have garlic salt, I used regular salt. Very tasty salsa--the longer it sits, the better it gets.

This is the best Pico de Gallo I have ever eaten.  I made it just as the recipe was written.  My husband can't get enough of it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I had to triple the tomatoes - mine were pretty small and my jalapenos were large - I also added a LOT more cilantro, 2 sprigs of my cilantro was only about 10 leaves.  I also ended up adding more lime - it just depends on how juicy your limes are.   Sorry, but I ended up making this with white onion - I swear I had red onion but could not find it.  White onion was great though.  (BTW - I found the red onion about a half hour after I had made this.)  Next time.  Thanks!

I quadrupled the recipe and it turned out fine. I am not giving it 5 stars for several reasons: I find that salsa recipes stating quantities of tomatoes and onions are inaccurate as tomato sizes vary largely. I replaced "2 tomatoes" to be "two CUPS of tomatoes" and likewise for the onion. The 2:1 ratio for tomatoes and onion in Pico seems to work really well. I did the same with the cilantro, converting the sprigs into tablespoons. After it was all said and done, I added sugar to mine (would be 1.5 teaspoons for the original recipe) as this always seems to just finish off a good pico for us. Kudos on NO VINEGAR as I feel vinegar ruins pico. The lime juice quantity was a bit more than other recipes I have used and we were pleasantly surprised at the wonderful difference it made.

I made the recipe. I always follow someone's recipe exactly the first time I make it. II have to say I'm sorry I followed this one and I disliked it. As far as I'm concerned the cumin does not belong in this recipe. Although I use cumin often when I cook, this recipe isn't good with it.

I never made pico de gallo before and it turned out great. I made steak fajitas and put the pico de gallo on with some white rice and corn and it  greatly enhanced the fajitas. I used 3 tomatoes and 3/4 of a red onion, I will definitely be making this for my next get together with friends. Great recipe, thanks!!!

First of all it's not spicy at all. It's very tasty but a whole red raw onion was too much! Not enough tomatoes either. jalapenos were perfect though. After no one in my family liked the raw onion taste, I had to fix it. I added 2 more smaller tomatoes, sauteed the red onion and added a little of balsamic vinegar to it. Taste great now. Next time use about 1/4 cup of raw red onion and/or sautee it.

We love cilantro. We added 8-10 sprigs of cilantro instead of 2. Turned out great!

More cilantro, NO garlic salt. Use regular salt to taste. Waaay more lime. Regular sweet onions can be subbed for purple.  TX style, I guess is what I'm advocating.  Cheers

Used Roma tomatoes. Two is way too little. Needs four or five. I love red onion and only used half of a medium and it was way too strong of an onion flavor. Next time I will try white/yellow onion and again use 1/4-1/2 of a medium onion. As others have stated 2 sprigs of cilantro is much too little. I probably used the leafy portion of about 15. By seeding the jalapenos mine had zero heat. Next time I will try only seeding one. The flavor overall was pretty good but it was just overpowered by the onion and lack of any heat at all knocked this down to three stars for me.

yummy! A little spicy for me so next time, Iâ€™ll only do one jalapeÃ±o. Added a little extra cilantro. Everyone love it and it was gone very quickly.

I didnâ€™t have enough red onion so I added some sweet onion to the mix. I used 8 small Campari tomatoes. I also used dried cilantro but ended up going to the store to get fresh and the addition helped make the dish. Perfect topping for steak fajitas.
