OK, so this is like 2 recipes in one-one for the cookies and one for the frosting-If I were reviewing the cookies alone, I would give them a 4...they are light, airy, and yummy...easy to work with too, they were perfectly done after 5 min. in my oven...The frosting, though. Personally, I feel that 'buttercream' should have at least one of those two ingredients in it...it tasted like pure shortening,(and I followed the recipe to a tee) also, because it was so greasy from the shortening, I literally had to run my dishwasher 2 times to get all of the residue off of the dishes (I put the mixing bowl in the dishwasher, and everything came out greasy) On top of this, the frosting did not hold color very well- it kept seperating out...maybe it would have been better if I had used the gel color, but I probably won't make these again to see...to the reviewer who stated that they would be using this frosting for all of their cakes from now on, may I make a suggestion? If you like this, try "Rick's special buttercream" from this site...WAY BETTER, just as easy...

I made the dough the night before so I could bake in morning.  This I would not reccomend. This way the dough was like a rock and a little too hard to work with but I did not give up and warmed the dough up a bit and they turned out beautiful.  I made 2 batches of the dough and you can double only the powdered sugar and flavorings on the frosting part to make more frosting, obviously adding more water/milk until you and your beaters feel that it is the perfect consistency for your cookies.  You do not need to double the shortening.  Delicious cookies, perfect cutouts.  Don't let the dough scare ya!

I wish I could give this more than 5!!  I tried two other very highly rated sugar cookie recipes, and this was the only one that actually baked correctly.  The cookies kept their shape - very nice!  the other recipes just kind of puffed out so my stars looked almost like flowers...I made the icing recipe from Delilah's sugar cook. recipe b/c I prefer that type (dries hard)  anyway, these are super great!!  making more today! :)

My kids and I made this recipe the other night. It was tough to wait two hours for the dough to chill, but well worth the wait. These sugar cookies are not too sweet, which is great if you are pairing them with royal icing. This recipe is a winner. We will use it time and time again. One note: I rolled the cookies out to about 1/4 inch thickness. I prefer a thicker cookie, this way the edges don't burn when you cook them.

~This is by far one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've ever had any luck with. I normally don't have much luck w/rolled sugar cookies (as the dough is always the wrong consistency..) i followed the recipe to the letter & they turned out PERFECT!! Afer chilling the dough, it was rather hard (don't let that scare you though, after working w/it for a few minutes it was fine!) I am making these again today & will let the dough sit for 5 mins or so after chilling so that it's easier to work with. I did the xmas cut-outs..they turned out great..I did read the review on these & the frosting prior to making them & I personally loved the frosting that goes w/these! It was a little thick & very sweet (plus there was lots left over..) But i always like my sugar cookie frosting to be that way..To the other reviewer that said that these turned out like 'dry biscuits'...must've done something wrong or not frosted them..I'm not an 'expert' baker, just an 'average' one & these were by far 'bakery' style cookies. I will use these for lots of differrent occasions now!! So glad I found it!

This was an awesome cookie and frosting recipe.  I had to cook the cookies a little longer than 4-6 minutes though.  I like my bottoms to be light brown.  Made these the week before Christmas and they stayed soft and yummy for quite a while. Frosting was the best I have ever tasted and will use on my cakes.  I used clear vanilla flavoring instead of the regular vanilla extract to keep it bright white. Loved this recipe.  Will use from now on.

6.10.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9440/sugar-cookies-with-buttercream-frosting/ ... This one's probably a five with a little more vanilla.  Reminds me of a notasrich shortbread cookie.  Stable enough to handle while frosting & buttery enough to not be the typical ughsugarcookie cookie.  I halved the recipe using 2/3c as half the 1 3/4c flour.  Rolled it in waxed paper, refrigerated overnight & sliced a bit less than 1/4 inch.  Nine minutes.  No need to wait to remove from the sheet.  I had leftover white cake frosting "one" (with adjustments in my review), ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7488/white-cake-frosting-i/ ... & they were a good combination.  'Had to make these again today - the next day btw :D - because they were eaten mostly unfrosted.  'Don't want to waste frosting now, do I?!?  Nooooo.  :D  Uh-oh, not enough white flour.  'Made full recipe using 2 1/2c white flour & a cup of wheat & guess what!  Good, too!  Yup, good recipe.  They kept their shape even better using that wheat flour, too.  Nice!

Didn't try the frosting, but the cookie is great! It tastes great by itself, and the dough is easy to work with. Bakes beautifully. This is definately my new cut-out cookie recipe :)

These cookies are great. Not too crispy, not too soft. They rolled out great- the batter wasn't too stick or too stiff. Perfect recipe!

Add a about 1-2 tsp cream of tartar (spice section) -really makes a difference.

Mine were dry. Good flavor unfrosted, nice to roll out. Would not make again. Looking for the perfect, light, flaky, soft melt in your mouth rolled out cookie. I don't know what the secret ingredient is-this needs something more to be a perfect cookie.

I only made the cookies, partially because I don't have shortening and partially because I didn't want to risk the frosting with all the negative reviews I saw for it. Instead I used "Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies." I honestly wasn't planning on using any frosting but when I took a bite from the first batch of these it tasted like a sweet biscuit. Other people in my family said it tasted fine but it wasn't what I was looking for so I whipped up the frosting and they were great and much better the next day too. I'm definitely making these again.

I halved the recipe and they turned out wonderful!  We used our kid-sized cookie cutters that are 1.5" and we ended up with 7 dozen cookies!  I ALWAYS have bad luck with rolling them and having them stick - but these didn't.  I did NOT refridgerate the dough and sprinkled confectioners sugar before rolling out the dough.

I didn't make the buttercream frosting, so this review is only for the cookies.  I made these for spiral snowman cookies, which are hand rolled then made into the shape of snowman by spiralling the roll.  I just did a small test batch today; I'm going to make them with my friend and her 3 1/2 year old tomorrow.  The dough is a tad crumbly and sticky, but that's easily dealt with by flour and chilling.  The cookie itself is rather bland, but I'm not complaining.  It will lend itself well to decorating.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not use the cookie recipe (I used the cream cheese sugar cookie recipe from this site). For the frosting I highly suggest deleting the butter flavored extract and use butter flavored crisco sticks instead of regular shortening. Butter flavor without the butter extract!!

This recipe turned out great for me. I loved how the cookies were not too sweet. The only thing I did different was chilling the dough for only 1 hour instead of two. The recipe still turned out delicious!

I'm rating the cookies only; I didn't make the frosting. However, the cookies were fabulous!  I mixed them up in no time, and the dough was easy to roll.  I rolled it into a rectangle and then just cut the dough into squares to avoid having any scrap dough to roll again. These cookies were not dry at all.  They were tender, slightly crispy on the outsides, perfectly sweet and buttery.  Remember, these were meant to be frosted, so the cookie itself isn't super, super sweet.  I think they are great on their own, though.  Try these!  They are addictive!

I loved the cookie and icing - received raves for them. I modify it for the seasons, e.g. add citrus to orange frosting for pumpkins, pink frosted hearts for valentine's day, etc.

I haven't found a reason to really leave feedback on recipes, but I was really displeased with this one. 
The dough was TOO HARD to work with after chilling for 1 hour. When it warmed up, it broke apart. 
These are TOO greasy for my preference. The counter was covered in the grease from this batter.
My husband, who LOVES sugar cookies (or at least all the ones I've made, as I see him stuffing himself with them...) was not thrilled with this recipe. No good flavor. Never again with this one.

Unfortunately I failed with this recipe and it was my first attempt ever at making sugar cookies.  Now I am discouraged :(  They stuck to my cookie sheets even after I tried greasing them.  Not sure how to correct this.  Perhaps I made them too thin?  I held one up to a ruler and it said it was just below 1/4 inch thick.  Initially didn't grease cookie sheet as instructed.  
Didn't try the buttercream frosting but used the frosting recipe on the powdered sugar bag.

DEEEElicious sugar cookie!  I didn't make the frosting because I have my own favorite, but the cookie is definitely my new go to favorite.  The dough was very easy to "cut", shaped well, and was so moist and delicious, even days later.

I am only rating the Frosting part of the recipe. I made Michelle's soft sugar cookies from this site. I used real butter instead of shortening. Made Christmas cookie cutouts, and divided the frosting into four bowls, and added a different food colorant to each bowl. It is a really good recipe.

Awesome soft sugar cookies. Just the recipe I was looking for. I did not use this frosting after reading the reviews. I used Better Homes & Gardens Butter Frsoting- awesome! There were no complaints!

My review is for the cookies only as I did not use the frosting from this recipe. This dough was easy to work with, baked up nicely (be sure to adjust baking time depending on the size of the cookies you are baking.) Delicious, too!

these cookies are amazing!  They become puffy once cooked but still have that pretty white color.  With the frosting they taste like the cookies that you can buy in the bakery section of Wal Mart or grocery stores!  Much better to make at home than buy at Wal Mart!!!

This is a very tasty recipe, but I would probably rename it to a shortbread cut-out cookie. It bakes up to the consistency and taste more like shortbread. I like it alot, but it just wasn't what I expected. So I was pleasantly surprised. I added a T of cinnamon to it to add something unique, and like other reviewers recommendations, a T of vanilla. I would also try them with almond. They are a little too crumbly when they are thin, so don't be afraid to cut them thick. They still bake nicely within 10 minutes. I added a 1/2 C of sugar and it could easily take another half without being too sweet. Next time I'll try 2 C of sugar and either 1 1/2 C of butter or maybe the equivalent of a stick of the butter crisco, just to make them a little more moist. I decorated them with my kids, so didn't use the frosting recipe. I would give the recipe a 4 as is, because it really does need a bit of tweaking. But make a few additions and they're yummy. Well worth the effort.  Also note, the dough does soften quickly, so be sure to be ready to cut after sitting out for just a couple minutes. I rolled it out beforehand into manageable squares stacked between wax paper and they were ready to be cut by little hands right away! Then you can quickly press out cut dough again while baking or decorating, refrigerate for 10 minutes, and you're back in business for the next round.

These are simply THE BEST sugar cookies ever.  They are my go-to recipe; I make them every Valentine's, Easter, Halloween and Christmas.  Follow the recipe exactly as is, and they will turn out perfectly every single time.  The ONLY thing is that I am referring to the cookies specifically, not the icing.  I have actually never made the icing as the idea of shortening and butter "flavoring" grosses me out, so I stick to a traditional butter cream icing, made with butter & cream!

I only made the cookies from this recipe, so I can only rate them, but they are delicious and I will definitely make this my go-to sugar cookie recipe. My only complaint is that the dough was super hard to roll out after it chilled, and it got dry and cracked by the time I was cutting out my last cookies. Maybe there is  remedy for this that I don't know about.

Rushed through these in the middle of the night last night for them to be taken to a school function, and they turned out beautifully! Really great soft texture, exactly how I like my sugar cookies. Used my own burnt buttercream frosting instead of your recipe, and they were amazing.

I made heart cut-out cookies for Valentine's Day, and I am more pleased with this cookie recipe than with any other sugar cookie recipes I've tried.  However, I won't be using this frosting recipe, instead just an original vanilla buttercream frosting made with butter instead of this shortening recipe.

Cooking times vary, especially with gas ovens.  If cooking with gas, bake time is 11-15 min.  Otherwise, excellent cookie recipe!  It's a keeper!

This cookie recipe is out of this world.  I have been searching for years and try a new one every year for Christmas cutouts.  The dough is really tasty and tender.  Easy to work with.  I highly recommend.  I would say that I got maybe 40 cookies out of a batch of dough.  Also, the 4-5 minutes baking time was right on.  You don't want them browning, as that makes them crunchy and not chewy.  Great cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I've tried several of the cutout recipes here and this one is the best one so far. The dough is so easy to work with and rolls perfect. (doesn't puff up too much, crack, or crumble) The cookies hold their shape. I used my own frosting recipe, so can't comment on the frosting, but the cookies are good and I'll definitely use this recipe in the future.

I've tried other sugar cookie recipes from this site, and this one is the best (although I use only the recipe for the cookie since I have a favorite icing recipe.)  I've made these for Thank You luncheons, my daughter's birthday party (all the kids decorate their own cookies), and baby showers.  Easy to roll out, and cutouts come out clean.  Thanks for sharing!

GREAT - but MUCH better the next day.  If you are making them for a party or for guests, I would definitely recommend you make them a day in advance.

Great cookies and easy to make.  I used colored sugar on the frosting to add some holiday color.  They have become my favorite out of all the cookies I made this year.  They are sweet without being too sweet and a holiday classic.

These cookies turned out great.  I didn't make the frosting this time because I was making the cookies to use up some store bought frosting that I had already.  Next time I'll definitely make the buttercream frosting.

Excuse me, I need to stand back up from my faint. I made both the cookie and the frosting. Since I never use shortening, I went ahead and used butter. Heavenly. I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars. It is that good. I also did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla as we love vanilla! This recipe is perfect.

These made the perfect sugar cookies for our Christmas baking tradition.  I found the dough the perfect consistency to roll and was much easier to work with than other recipes I have tried.  My 10 and 7 year old boys loved decorating them.

Excellent sugar cookie recipe!  I did not use the frosting recipe, as I did not have butter extract.  I used "Sugar Cookie Frosting" from this site and these turned out excellent.  I made mine quite large, so baking time had to be adjusted.  Will use again, thanks!

Excellent sugar cookie and frosting. Just made these for our annual sugar cookie Christmas party and this is THE recipe I will use from now on. The cookies have a very good flavor, easy to make & roll out. The icing is flavorful, takes color well and crusts over perfectly while still being soft when you bite into it. No complaints.

Excellent cookie recipe. Tasted great. I did the recipe exactly (I did add more vanilla but by accident. My bottle of Mexican vanilla has a large top so extra went in). 

It tasted great and the cookies were light, delicious and had a very nice texture.

Thanks for the recipe. Definitely in my recipe box.

This is a wonderful cookie recipe! I didnt make the icing because I didnt have the butter extract, but the cookies were great without it!

My favorite sugar cookie now!!!  Thanks soooo much for sharing!  I made this along side another sugar cookie recipe from this site (I only wanted to make the best sugar cookies to give as gifts to family and friends for the holidays!) and this one won by more than a mile! So,  today I made 2-3 batches of this (the winning recipe)!  This cookie (slightly) puffs beautifully and tastes yummy!!! I used a different frosting on the cookies though, but maybe next time I'll try the buttercream frosting too!

I made these cookies, not the frosting but they were FLAWLESS. I baked them at a lower temp and for longer but that was just personal preference. This will be my sugar cookie recipe forever.

VERY GOOD. MUCH EASIER TO FROST AND ADD A FEW SPRINKLES AFTER BAKING THEN TO  MESS AROUND WITH THE SPRINKLES BEFORE BAKING REGULAR SUGAR COOKIES. THE FROSTING WAS A BIG HIT WITH MY KIDS. THANKS

These cookies were delicious!! I made these for Halloween, with intent to frost them, but they were gone before I got the chance! My family loved them and I would definitely make these again, and hopefully get to frost them this time!! :)

This is the perfect dough for cut-outs. The dough did not stick to my cookie cutters, even the vintage ones with enclosed backs. 5 minutes was a good baking time. I chilled the dough overnight and busted into smaller sections to roll out. It is very forgiving and melds into itself well when I had cracks or breaks. This is by far my new favorite sugar cookie recipe as they tasted fantastic! I did not try the frosting recipe. Instead used royal icing then decorated with "Simple & Delicious Butter Cream Frosting"

Excellent (cookie) recipe (Frosting recipe I did not follow)!

Disclaimer: I ATTEMPTED to follow it exactly, however, am in Italy at the moment so I had to use the metric converter, which always seems to short change the flour (I added more until the dough seemed reasonable to roll and didn't stick like crazy to my fingers).

I also had to make my own cookie cutters, which can be done easily by shaping strips of a sliced up pop can (thank you pinterest!!). Therefore, my cookies were RATHER on the small side (obsiously, less than a pop can diameter), and a half receipe turned out to make about 40 of these small little cookies. The cookies were soft and delicious!

I just used butter and powdered sugar with some vanilla for the frosting, because what the heck is the point using shortening and butter flavoring!?

My mother in law bakes goods for a popular espresso bar and really liked these cookies. That says a lot. I used a lemon cream cheese frosting instead of the frosting recipe.

Fantastic recipe for both cookie and frosting. For those that dont know, most butter cream frostings from stores are made with shortening and NOT butter. They have to produce it with a longer "use" life and I tell you, this is tops. I have made half recipes in the past week and both times- came out perfect and I HATE making sugar cookies because of the time involved but I make the frosting first- then the dough- when i get ready to bake i take the frosting out to room soften. I also use the butter flavored shortening instead of the flavoring- works great.   Better than bakery bought cookies.

I love this recipe. This is the best sugar cookie recipe that I have used. Some of the reviews say the dough come out hard. Mine did not and I did not need to let it get to room tempter. I used butter flavored Crisco which made the dough easy to work with and the cookies came out nice and soft not hard like some of the recipes that I have used. I baked mine for 7 minutes and they came out perfect.

Cookie was not very sweet. Then came the frosting which did improve the cookie. Only gave 3 stars as the cookie was more of a biscuit.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. The cookies tasted like dry, flavorless biscuits. The frosting is delicious, however, and I will definitely use again.

I couldn't really decide if I liked these cookies or not. Sigh.  They are definately NOT sweet so if you're looking for something sweet these are not it.  They don't taste very good w/o frosting.  I didn't make the frosting to this recipe and just used canned frosting.  They actually tast better after a day or so.  My husband loves them.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for taste! I couldn't roll it out but that was probably because I was very silly and used margarine instead of butter. I only realised what I was doing when it was too late!
I chose not to make the frosting so we can eat more cookies without feeling too guilty... ;)
And they are DELICIOUS! I can't stop eating them and I've only just got them out of the oven!!!

These cookies are Tasty!  Not too sweet, so I made my own chocolate frosting on them and they were delicious.
A little difficult to cut out, so towards the end I just used a spoon to drop them out, and they turned out fine.

Very good! I was working with a 3yr old and found that sticking the rolled out dough back in the fridge for a few minutes BEFORE cutting made transferring to the cookie sheet easier.

This is THE BEST cut out recipe there is on the net.  I made these from my annual cookie exchange and all 11 women raved about them.  To save time frosting (20 dozen take a while), I purchased buttercream icing from Sam's Club.  They were a huge hit and are our family's new favorite.  I will make them again at Valentine's Day.  I did refrigerate the dough overnight before rolling and cutting them out.  I cannot say enough about how great a recipe this is!  Use real butter (salted), and refrigerate....these are THE BEST!!!!!

I didn't love this recipe the first time I made it, but I don't like frosting.  A lot of other people did though.  The second time I made it I added a tsp. of lemon zest.  This made it delicious!

I did not make the frosting, but the cookies turned out well.  This is the easiest sugar cookie dough to work with.  It is not sticky and rolls very nicely.  Next time I will bake them at a lower temp.  I burned the bottoms of the cookies for two pans (and that was half the batch).  I will definitely bake them again.

The cookie was wonderful, light and soft; however, I didn't care for the frosting. I will try another frosting next time I make these.

I used butter instead of shortening and omitted the butter flavoring and the frosting still turned out delicious.  I had to cook the cookies a litter longer than the recipe called for. My kids had a blast making these.

Not bad, but not spectacular either. I made these without the buttercream frosting (since I didn't have the butter extract) so I thought I'd give a fair rating, all things considered. I used Sugar Cookie Icing from this site. The dough was the perfect consistency and easy to work with, which was a huge plus. I just thought they were rather bland and missing something. Maybe it's the buttercream frosting :) I'll be willing to give them another try someday.

These cookies tasted VERY good. I don't know if I did something wrong with the frosting though cause it wasn't creamy - it looked like the powdered sugar chunked up but it tasted really good.

Perfect Christmas/Holiday Cookie Recipe! They really do taste like they were store bought. I used 1tsp of Vanilla & bought cream cheese frosting. I made soft ones and crunchy ones. My family loved this cookie. I will for sure mark this as my perfect sugar cookie recipe. I had fun decorating the snowflakes & trees!

Perfect recipe to make a traditional cut out sugar cookie. If you want to make this even more over the top divine try adding a couple of teaspoons of Allspice to the flour mixture before adding it to the butter mixture. Tastes exactly how my mother's and grandmother's sugar cut outs tasted when I add the allspice. Perfection!

Only made the cookies, not the frosting.  Cookies are excellent!  I'd call them a butter cookie, not a sugar cookie though, not too sweet but rich.  The dough is harder than hell to get mixed, but it pays off because it holds up very well and does not get crumbly even with extensive kneading and rolling.  I added a couple extra tablespoons of melted butter when mixing.  1/4" thickness when rolling out dough is too much,  a little over 1/8" was ideal.  The tops of the cookies don't darken much when cooking, so check the bottoms or they can get overdone fast.

I LOVE these cookies! I have made these cookies three times and I prefer almond extract instead of vanilla extract. I thought it made them more "sugar cookie" and less "shortbread".  Will definitely be making these again!

This were a runny mess. I obviously did something wrong. I think it was because I used a mixer to mix in the flour mixer. Next time I’ll use a spoon. I ended up having to spoon the batter onto the cookie sheet. Cookies actually tasted good but was disappointed that I couldn’t roll them out and use cutters.

The cookies came out great - soft and buttery! But it is quite labor-intensive.  After chilling the dough it is hard as a rock and requires quite a bit of pounding before it can be rolled out and cut.  I decided NOT to use buttercream frosting and I'm glad - the cookie is plenty sweet, and I think the buttercream would have been overwhelming.  I just brushed on a simple glaze made of milk, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla.

The recipe turned out exactly as described and baking for only 6 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect. I would like for someone to convert one pound of powdered sugar to cups.

Excellent recipe, cookies are light and fluffy and just melt in your mouth.  I didn't make the icing with the shortening and used butter instead and some light cream to thin it and it was perfect, I only used vanilla in the frosting.  My cookies took about 7 minutes to bake.

I didn't chill the dough...not a good idea. It was very soft and hard to work with. It seemed greasy and the shapes wouldn't stay together. With chilled dough, I think this recipe will deserve 5 stars. With warm dough, maybe 2 1/2. Will definitely chill next time! I didn't use the icing recipe, so I can't rate it. I did, however, use another from Allrecipes.

Love these! Easy to roll and cut out, taste delicious! This is the recipe I will want to use from now on.  I did roll them out on parchment paper and sprinkled a combo of flour and powdered sugar to roll them in. Used Mom's icing recipe because it is the BEST and I don't like shortening in the frosting.

I made the cookies and they were terriffic.  I ran out of all-purpose flour and had to sub about half whole wheat flour, and they still tasted great.  I look forward to trying them again without the substitution.

I skipped the icing for another recipe based on some of the comments.

Literally the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever made!  Doubled the recipe, used margarine instead of butter, and did my own sort of butter cream/royal icing with mint flavoring.  I cooked then about 7 minutes a batch, they were moist, crumbly and perfect! Vthe kids liked them even without the icing!  Definitely my new forever sugar cookie recipe!

Tasted great and was easy to roll once the chilled dough warmed up a bit. I should have removed the dough from the refrigerator about 30 minutes ahead of time.

I have made these cookies several times and they always turn out perfect. I do not use the icing recipe included for my particular taste I prefer not to have shortening in my icing although I did find another delicious hardening icing that is simply powdered sugar vanilla and milk.

I've only made the cookies sans frosting since our family isn't fond of frosting.  They are delicious! Buttery, with the right combo of crispy outside and flaky/soft inside.  I rounded vanilla to 2 tsp. Def a keeper for holiday cookies!

I love it! I'm 11 and I've made this twice... one time with the frosting that comes with it. This is the only reason I'm giving this a 4 star. I used butter instead of shortening and I'm not sure if this was the reason but it was SO runny. I added a LOAD more powdered sugar and then it turned out good. The second time I made this was with royal frosting and it was GREAT! The cookies were good except I ended up baking them for 7-8 minutes because I wanted them hard enough so that they wouldn't fall apart when the icing was on. I brought both versions to school and everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was far too sticky to roll out, much less cut. I refrigerated 2hrs, but seeing the state of the dough, tried to give it longer to see if it would come around. Nope. After 5hrs, it was horrific to work with. I ended up putting the dough on my cookie sheet in spoonfulls flattened with a flour coated fork, but even that was a sticky mess. When finished, the cookies weren't that good. Very disappointed.

I am a professional baker and I am always testing out sugar cookie recipes because 
A. They are either too dry or too sweet.
B. I don't care for sugar cookies because I've had too many bad ones.
 Until I made this recipe. I had my daughter's friends over for baking and decorating Halloween cookies and made this dough. The cookies were wonderful. We made icing with shortening ( not butter) and it complimented this very well.

Review for Cookie only (did not make the icing).   These taste really good.  The only change I made was not adding the vanilla (didn't have any) My family still really like the taste, and we will be making these again! I did have some issues with using cookie cutters on them, the dough seemed to get really soft too quick, then the shapes just kinda melded back together and had to go into the freezer for a bit in order for me to get them onto the cooking sheet.  But other than that, it was easy to make, they did only take 5 minutes to cook and I use a stone to cook them on.    Great cookie recipe

I made these cookies today and they were awesome. Easy dough to work with and easy ingredients. I baked them a little longer than what the recipe calls for but they continue to bake after you take them out of the oven so you have to be careful when adding time to the cooking time. I found keeping the dough in the fridge for 2 hours a little too long. Next time I would only put the dough in the fridge for about 1 hour. Certainly a recipe keeper.

I didn't make the frosting, but the cookies are flawless! We split the dough in half and chilled each for 30 minutes before rolling out and cutting cookies out with mini cookie cutter/punches. They were adorable and delicious! We cooked them for 6 minutes as we like the edges a little toasty. Highly recommend. Didn't alter the recipe at all.

Just made the dough. It is chilling in the fridge.  Dough is a bit saltier than I expected but Delish.  Next time, a tad less salt for us. But it is good!  Very good!!

These are perfect even without icing. They maintained their moist and soft texture even a week later (I know, I can't believe there were any left after a whole week!). Thank you for sharing.

I can't say anything about the frosting but I've made the cookie part of the recipe several times.  It's easy and they always turn out great.

I only had time to make the cookies , not the frosting. The cookies are wonderful!  They cut out beautifully, bake quickly, and are easy to decorate. The cookies are soft and chewy and smooth. I'll keep using this recipe

I can't rate the icing because I only made the cookies but so far this is one of  my favorites. I refrigerated the dough overnight and it was still very easy to work with the next day. This recipe made wonderful sugar cookies.

First of all, 5 star taste, and 5 star directions. However, the only way you could possibly get 60 cookies from this recipe is if you used miniature cookie cutters. If you sincerely need more than 30 regular sized sugar cookies, double the recipe. Also, I opted out of the frosting and made a vanilla cream cheese frosting instead which complimented the flavor of these cookies perfectly :)

Loved the cookies but the frosting all u tasted was shortening so I added a few tablespoons of baking chocolate powder and it covered it up I also added a 1/2 teaspoon mint flavor so it was delicious
By the way I had the dough in the fridge overnight I used a glass mixing bowl with lid

I made these exactly as the recipe stated (a double batch though & used my own frosting). The dough was very easy to work with. They weren't overly sweet which I prefer. I gave it four stars only because I have to agree with others who thought it was more like a shortbread/biscuit than a traditional sugar cookie. Still a good recipe

These cookies were super easy to make.  The dough was easy to work with, and the cookies kept their shape and didn't expand when baked.  I used almond extract, which gave them a nice flavor, topped with tinted sugar, and baked them about 7 minutes.  That being said, I probably won't make them again, as my family prefers a crisper sugar cookie and these are on the soft side.  But it's a great recipe if you're a soft sugar cookie fan!

My teacher and I made these cookies, and they were a little too salty and not very sweet.  We made them a second time, and we used 1.25 cups of sugar and only 3 cups of flour.  Everyone agreed they were better the second time.

Also, we used red and blue food colouring to make them beautiful, and we put mnms on them before they went in the oven.

I think I may have just replaced my all-time favorite sugar cookie recipe! Texture, sweetness, and ease all perfect. I was hesitant about the frosting, but I really like it. I'm about to deliver them to my children and grandchildren! The true test!

Best sugar cookie I've ever made.  Easy to mix and dough is easy to work with.  I'm not  a froster, I like  traditional colored sugar and sprinkles.  8 minutes in an electric oven was perfect.

I wasn't overly fond of this cookie, not sweet enough for me, I usually like cut out cookies even without the frosting but these need the frosting. Roll the cookies to the thickness that you want as they do not rise, but they do keep their shape well, dough was easy to work with so overall not a bad choice, just like a little sweeter cookie.

This review is solely on the cookies themselves. I made these for the first time today. It was definitely easy to make, and to dough was not too bad to handle. I did chill the dough for about three hours instead of the two recommended. I did not, however, make the icing based on previous reviews. That being said, the taste is kind of bland. These are cookies that need an icing to give them that extra flavor. The cookies are not bad at all, airy and light. They just need a little something to give it that extra "Yum".

Maybe something went wrong I cut the recipe in half for me, but these didn't turn out right at all! There was WAY too much flour. I had to add a lot more butter when mixing the dough so it wasn't just dough-colored dust, and even with icing (I just did powdered sugar and milk- I didn't try the buttercream here), they just taste like flour. Maybe the proportions are right if you make the full batch or do the math yourself, but I've never run into problems using that feature before.

This dough was so easy to work with and tasty both with and without frosting. I didn't use the frosting from this recipe (I used the sugar cookie icing recipe to make). I let the dough sit for an hour in the fridgerator and it was perfect. Thank you!

This recipe was perfect. I was on the edge about using the frosting recipe because of the mixed reviews, but when I tried another one and it was a total disaster I had to use this one as a back up and everything turned out great. These cookies were delicious!

In the end i had to add and egg and cook them a little longer. That being said, they are my favorite type of sugar cookies. They are soft but not chewy just like sugar cookies should be! Even better with frosting and sprinkles.

I've never really been a fan of sugar cookies; they've just been another cookie on the cookie tray. This recipe changed my mind completely - the cookies weren't overwhelmingly sweet, they held their shape (didn't deform while baking), and turned out pleasantly soft after cooling. We ate them all. In like three days. I paired them with Sugar Cookie Icing because I wanted something that would dry hard and travel well. YUM!

Love these. I refrigerate them for a day in an airtight bag before baking that way you're not tempted to rush the cooling process. They roll well on a slightly floured counter and if you use parchment paper to line your cookie sheets, no cooking spray or oil is needed on the pan. I haven't made the icing yet as I like to use the ones you can write with from the store for more intricate designs.

Made this recipe for Christmas cookies and they were fabulous! I chilled the dough overnight and made the cookies the next day. I added a couple of cups of confectioner suger and 1/2 cup crisco to turn the frosting into decorator frosting.

Wonderful for cut outs!! The cookies held the cut out shapes, no spreading.  I did add 1/2 tsp more vanilla. cooked them for about 5mins.  Turned out perfect!  This is now my go to recipe for sugar cookies.

These cookies rose too much.  I also didn't try the frosting.  They tasted ok. I guess my only complaint was they didn't hold their shape as well as other recipes I've tried because they rose and expanded while baking.

I simply used butter in place of shortening and butter flavoring in the frosting.  Delicious!  These cookies had a perfect consistency for rolling and shaping. Will definitely make more!

Made these cookies and frosting last night with my kids. It's a great recipe all the way around. I followed the directions and had no problems. We even colored the icing and found it to be easy to work with. The next morning the frosting was firmer, but still soft and yummy. My 5 y/o son was able to roll out the dough and use his cookie cutters. Thanks for sharing!!

I couldn't use this recipe with the sugar cookies that I made (the recipe for which is also on this site, the "best rolled sugar cookies").  They just did not go well together at all.  This could be because, unlike usual, I did not read the reviews first and I just mixed everything together for a quick and simply icing.  WAY TOO MUCH VANILLA.  To compensate, I tried adding more powered sugar but the damage was already done.

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made (I did not use this frosting).  They whip together easy, roll out perfect, and bake up beautifully.  Not to mention that they taste wonderful.  One batch makes about 15 4-inch cookies and I baked them at 375 degrees for 12 minutes.

This was the first time I made sugar cookies and they turned out fabulous!  (I took another's suggestion and used the decorator frosting recipe and that went perfect with these cookis.  I'm not a big fan of shortening.)  I was surprised how quickly the dough became warm and thus a little harder to work with.  I made these with my five-year old and I brought out the chilled dough in small batches to work with.  I also found the metal cookies cutters to work best...I was able to get a couple quick cuts with my plastic cutters (the "closed" kind, with details) if I used them right when the dough came out and if I didn't press all the way.  When the dough began to warm, my cookie cutter got stuck in the dough!  I also ended up making mine a little thicker in some batches, but just kept a close eye and pulled them out at the first hint of brown.  Some cookies I thought I even cooked too long, but they still came out soft and wonderful!  This recipe gave me at least 4 dozen cookies!

Everyone raved about these cookies. My husband is very picky about which cookies he likes and typically prefers store-bought. However, he loved these cookies and him and the kids were challenged to see who ate more and who could find the best places to hide them from everyone else!

These are great cookies.  I sent them to daycare for my son's birthday and brought some to work.  Everyone enjoyed them.  The cookies were soft, but didn't fall apart.  I also used the buttercream frosting for a cake too.  For the cake, I added 3/4 of cocoa and a few more tablespoons of water and it is so good!  The best chocolate buttercream frosting I ever tasted!

Because this is two recipes in one I'm rating it a 3.  

The cookies alone would have been a 5!  They were delicious and so easy to roll out and my daughter had a ball baking and decorating them... and even more fun eatting them and bouncing off the walls with her sugar high.

The frosting however was pretty plain.  My husband did like it but everyone else agreed with me that it was anything special and not that much flavoring to it.  I was thinking it would have a richer flavor to it reading the buttercream description.  I would have rated this a two alone.  

I will defiantly be using this cookie recipe in the future and cannot wait until Valentines to do more cut-outs with my daughter but we will be looking for a new frosting recipe!

These turned out delicious although I didn't use the icing recipe. I used canned icing.  But I had trouble at first with the dough being very sticky.  After adding quite a bit of flour they cut out fine.

These were pretty good. I rolled them out 1/4 and found the time to cook them needed to be adjusted. We like ours crunchy so I rolled the second batch out thinner and cooked for about 9 min. Didnt make the frosting either. I thought the dough was really easy to work with after chilling over night. I will use this recipe again.

Great cookies!  The dough is easy to work with but does require some flour so it doesn't stick to things.  I did not use the frosting listed though.  I made a simple frosting with 3 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 cup butter, 3 TBSP of milk, and 1-1/2 tsp vanilla.  Nothing too fancy but it was very simple.  The cookies are delicate though, especially when you bake them for the shorter amount of time.  A couple of mine broke with my frosting.  But I was very happy with the result!

Me and my family love soft sugar cookies.  This recipe was great!  I put the dough in freezer for about 15 minutes and it was ready to be rolled out.  Once they were baked and frosted I put all the cookies in a can.  Then, they were nice and soft next day.  My 13 year old daughter loved them, too!!  So thank you!!!!

Delicious cookie! I used half butter, half margarine, both low fat.  I did use a different frosting recipe I got from allrecipes.com...it was a chocolate buttercream frosting, I just left off the chocolate.  Very good Christmas cookies!

These cookies were amazing, i just got done making my second batch except this time i spread the dough over the whole pan and made a fruit tart flag for 4th of july! it baked up wonderfully!  

It stayed a very light color even though it was done so I would watch for this if anyone else decides to make the cookie this way!

These are the easiest sugar cookies I have ever made!! I tried the icing just for kicks since I usually use my own recipe and it was pretty good too. I had to hide them from my kids and husband and then I had to make more the following week. Overall very yummy cookies and icing!

We made these in February, and they were such a hit, I just made a double batch today for Easter cookies!  We made them extra thick, and undercooked them just slightly.  I used an almond butter cream frosting and would have to admit, better than any sugar cookie I have ever eaten.

I used a different icing recipe, but these cookies are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever made. They are tender yet crisp and lightly sweet. I will be saving this recipe!

These were great cookies-I much prefer sugar cookies with butter opposed to shortening.  I used all the ingredients as listed and did cut the dough in three and wrapped the flattened balls in plastic wrap and stuck in the fridge for a few hours.  Makes it easier when you take it out and roll it- to do it in sections so the dough doesn't get too warm and sticky!  Did use diff icing recipe because the reviews on this one weren't so promising.  Really good recipe for cookie cutting with the kids!  THANKS!

Really great cookies.  Think I might try to ice them with Royal Icing next time.  Loved the frosting, but didn't find them easy to decorate like traditional holiday cookies.  Truly a frosting, not that hard, glazed look - but kids loved topping them with colored sugars and sprinkles.  Thanks!

These were the best(tasting) rolled cookies I have ever made. I prepared the dough and then I placed it in some plastic wrap and formed a disk. I chilled it for two hours. I rolled it out and the kids had fun choosing their shapes. The scraps re-rolled nicely! I used a different buttercream icing recipe from this site though! I will keep this cookie recipe for years to come. Thank you!!!

These were pretty good but not the very best I've had.  I did not notice a difference in the frosting with the addition of the butter flavoring - perhaps it needs more than what the recipe calls for...all in all, a good basic sugar cookie recipe.

The cookies are wonderful, buttery and light. They bake up very fast so get an assembly line going. Frosting was good too. My family loved them and we went thru 3 dozen in two days!Just made another batch.

The cookie dough is very easy to work with, however the buttercream tastes too sugary.  I would reduce the butter by half and add cream cheese as the replacement to the other half of the butter.

Yummy!  And very addictive I used butter shortening in the frosting in addition to the flavoring it worked very well.

I did not use your sugar cookie recipe, but I did use the frosting recipe.  I was terrific.  I was so easy to make too.  I'm truly going to use that frosting recipe again.  Great Job!
