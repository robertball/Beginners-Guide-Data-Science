This recipe calls for a lot of rum! (About twice what the recipe on the BICARDI RUM RUNNER can calls for!)So yes, my guests enjoyed it. But after 1 drink half of them were waisted. I made 3 batches of the recipe for 7 people. Eyes started closing, and the party ended early!! So I wouldn't make it again. One guest said it was like drinking a bottle of rum with a little red coloring put in.
