This was Delicious! ! I added some chopped jalapeno and onion. I used Grand biscuits that I flattened and used to fill them. Cilantro was also thrown in. I baked them up and served them with creamy avocado and Mexican Creme. The meat was already seasoned and chopped along with a can of beer, so I put it in the oven and went to work out. When I got back, the house smelled Good! They were very mummy if not a bit Hot from peppers. Thanks Lola.  Keeper

The raisins mixed with the meat reminded me of Indian food, so I added curry. I had to add a lot of salt and curry before the pork stopped tasting watery. I used a lot more raisins about 3 handfuls. I subbed corn for the peas and carrots.  My husband raved it.  He told me several time that it was delicious.  He also said it didn't need ketchup.  From him this is high praise indeed.  I will definitely be making my version again.

I was a little hesitant making this recipe, cuz it was like the first thing I had ever cooked with raisins in (I put like 6 times as much as I should of as well, my mistake) but it was still delicious. I also didn't see the recipe was set to make 24 servings so I ended up with waaayy more filling than I bargained for. It's okay though, we made more dough and enjoyed them for two or three more meals! Also, I prefer mine baked, but that's just me.

This was a great recipe, especially the filling. It calls for a bit of work dicing the ingredients, but well worth the time and effort. We weren't too impressed with the crust, but it worked okay. The filling also great on cooked rice. This is a "keeper" recipe!

I have never done empanadas but when I tried this, it was fairly easy and delicious. I used ground beef and made other with ground turkey since we don't eat pork. I added some chipotle saucd with the meat and came out awesome definitely experiment with this! Thank you.
