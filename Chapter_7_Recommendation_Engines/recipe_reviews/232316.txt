Fideo is vermicelli pasta. A much thinner spaghetti pasta. Cooks faster than spaghetti.  The recipe calls for 2 measurements of minice onion  when there should be only 1.. I prefer to use fresh chopped onion . I cook it at the same time I brown my meat. (ground beef or whole steak diced in bite sized cubes) I don't measure just toss in a handful.  When the meat is cooked I add the box of vermiceli and cook the noodles stirring until brown.  Cover with water. Add tomato, spices , salt and pepper to taste and cook on low until pasta is tender. about 10 minutes.   I don not use green bell pepper in my recipe. On occasions I add a small potato cut in small cubes and add it to the fideo when I add the water. Cook until fideo and diced potato are done. Do not over cook fideo.

This turned out pretty good and far better than I expected honestly. I used ground venison in place of beef but that was the only change I made. I am a little confused by the "mexican spaghetti". Fideo as I know it is soup which is what I originally had when I turned the stove off but the noodles absorbed so much of the liquid within a few minutes that "mexican spaghetti" is what ended up on the dinner table. Regardless, the flavor was good. You'll just need to add more liquid (I chose spicy V-8) if you want the more soup consistency.

I'm not sure what to compare this with because I've never had Fideo before. I wasn't sure what Fideo noodles were but what I could find on the internet said that it was spaghetti, so that is what I used. I followed the recipe, but I had to add about 4 cups of water to get the noodles completely cooked. It was kind of strong on the onion and garlic flavor for me. I think I would cut the onion and garlic powder in half if I make this again.

Good recipe to use as a basis for my first time making fideo!  I only used 8 oz. of fideo noodles, used chopped onion and garlic rather than dried or powdered, left out the green pepper because I didn't have it, substituted diced tomatoes and half a can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce, and used beef broth to cover instead of beef bullion and water.  My husband and I both thought it turned out great!  I'll make it again, and will probably include green bell pepper next time.

This was really tasty!  I tweaked this a little using fresh shallot and garlic.  Browned the GB, removed and sauteed 1 chopped shallot and a large garlic minced. Removed and fried the fideo in olive oil until brown. I used chicken broth instead of water, cut the cumin to 1 Tbl and added one 8 oz can of V-8.  I think the recipe either needs more liquid or less fideo because it sucked up all the juices and I even added another cup of broth!   Other than that - It was quick and very tasty.  My 23 yr old ate 3 huge bowls! It's a keeper.

This is a quick and easy dinner for a week night. I made it a bit differently (but rating on the as is recipe). For one, I added frozen corn and some black beans (my kids not green pepper fans). I also use more cumin and less salt as the boullion has plenty.  But thatâ€™s the joy of this recipe - doctor it as you would like!!!

Substitute real onion for onion flakes and added some sofrito. My daughter had seconds, no leftovers.
