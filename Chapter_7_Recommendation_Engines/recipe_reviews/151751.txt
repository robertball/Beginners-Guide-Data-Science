This is a wonderful, handy recipe.  I made a lemon pie and, since no one in my family likes the meringue on the pie, I had leftover egg whites.  I remembered printing this recipe for future use and gave it a try.  They were a huge hit with my kids! I used Sugar Free Jello and it worked wonderfully.

These turned out really well! I used strawberry jello powder for the red and they are my absolute favorite. Soft inside and crunchy on the outside.

Very light and fluffy. I think I might try leaving the oven closed as they weren't crispy enough for me, though.

Love these!! I used margarita flavored jello and served them at our annual Christmas pary.  Everyone loved them and were disappointed that there weren't any leftover for them to take home.  I am planning to make more this weekend in cherry flavor and more margarita flavor, put them in decorative tins and give out to all of our friends and family on Christmas.
