We had to cook our chicken more than the recipe suggested, and it didn't turn out very flavorful. However, the sauce and veggies were fantastic over rice!

YES !  Simple and Profound. Wonderful. We use legs and thighs. Rice noodles are a great backdrop
and texture change. This goes to the top of our list.

I recommend cooking it for longer (at least a half hour after boiling).  This recipe is FANTASTIC!  The chicken was moist and tender and the black bean paste added extra flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I omitted the onions, pepper and chives and subbed breasts for thighs, sesame oil for olive and ginger powder for fresh. Instead of adding the chicken later, I added everything at once, to give more time to cook. I also just used canned drained black beans and threw in some brocolli. The sesame oil, ginger and soy sauce I added later made it "oriental" tasting. Another idea is smashing the beans with a spoon to make a paste, if you're looking to do more work with the recipe.
