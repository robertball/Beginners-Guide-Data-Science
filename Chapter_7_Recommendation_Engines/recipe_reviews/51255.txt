Great recipe, although in our family we never add garlic. Dill weed and parsnip go into the soup in Eastern Europe, it's the version I grew up with. To make the process a little easier, simply tie up a bunch of dill (I also add parsley) and drop into the pot. Same for onion -- no need to chop. Peel it, pierce with a knife in a couple of spots, and drop it in. Discard boiled dill and onion when done. Garnish the soup with fresh chopped dill.

Thankyou soo much Layla for this recipe Ive had the flu for a couple of days and was feeling really down,all I could think of was having some of my Auntie sephfa's chicken matza ball soup that she had last made me as a teenager,in desperation I looked on the internet,and found laylas great recipe,I followed It to the letter,(even had my husband drive the 40 kms to nearest big town to find Matzo meal and Dill,we live on a property out of town)Its been 30 odd years since I was a teen, but I still recognise the taste.Laylas soup did the trick, and yes putting less meal in the matzo balls does make them float,fed it to all n my family last night all enjoyed it, and Im feeling a lot better today so thankyou again Layla and God bless you, keep cooking and sharing recipes Love Sebria

I don't know what region the author is from, but in the south, we Jews use the following ingredients for REAL Jewish chicken soup: cut-up chicken, carrots, celery, and onions. parsnips and dill weed? No way! Of course, the matzoh balls are great. I like your recipe for them. Thanks.

This is a staple for me, I have made this soup many times! (I have yet to make the matzo balls, I have my own recipe for dumplings & make mine differently.) But the method & and ingred. for the broth are perfection---really warms you up on a cold Autumn day! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I made this for my sick husband and he declared that he was feeling "much better" right after having two bowls.  The only change that I made was I boiled the chicken first in water, threw out the water (this way, I got rid of a lot of the chicken fat and other "stuff" that comes out when you first cook the chicken, and then I started with step one per the recipe as written.  Really delicious and a definite addition to our family recipe book!

I came across this recipe searching for matzo ball recipes since I wanted to try making them from scratch vs. a mix. I haven't made them yet but wanted to comment on the soup recipe. It's interesting to read what others put in their soup. My Russian Jewish Great Grandma made hers with whole chicken, celery, parsnips, turnips, carrots, onions, dill and "flanken" (I later learned that flanken = short ribs). You only use a few pieces of the short ribs to give it some added depth & flavor. For me dill is the most important ingredient for without it, it simply doesn't taste like Jewish Chicken soup. It comes down to what you're used to or what you grew up with.

Loved it. This is a great tasting recipe for what we call "jewish penicillin". It will cure anything and everything. I made this recipe earlier this week after being dehydrated from the flu and I got back on my feet in no time!!!

This was very tasty soup.  I couldn't find matzo meal at the store, so I used my standard dumpling recipe.  It was still very good.  Thanks!

Good recipe only I add 4 or 5 chicken feet for flavor and adds a jelly for richness... discard them after cooking....also garlic and peppercorns and celery root are added .Carrots and parsnips can be added to cook in broth in final 30 minutes.Serve with barley or matzo balls.Skim some fat off after a day or so in fridge.....
The fat on dried bread makes a nice treat for birds in winter!!!

GREAT RECIPE!!! I love the "sinkers."  Thick, heavy Matzoh balls are the best!  And I eat EVERYTHING.  That means parsley, parsnips, and anything else added, including, guess what--the skeleton.  Ugh...  But simply delicious and very gratifying.  Another suggestion:  If you have a good bite, get into the bones, or suck the meat right off the bird.  By now it's tender, right?  :-)

Ok- This soup was amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly and everything was perfect.  The only thing I could not figure out was how to remove the chicken bone fragments from the chicken meat after the soup was finished....

In every way I have been taught about chicken soup or chicken based soup ..... I was told to flavor it with garlic as they use this to avoid colds ---- don't knock it, it works. I have not had a cold in years and I am now turning 67. Add ginger to your taste!

My husband said it was the best chicken soup he'd ever had.  The matzoh balls bombed but the soup WAY more than made up for that.  The dill and parsnips gave it a nice fresh taste.  This one is saved and will be my go to recipe.  Now if I could just solve the matzoh ball problem...

great recipe! However, it is missing the chicken feet, just like my jewish great-grandmother's from europe taught her daughter. This recipe (plus the feet for flavor and gelatin quality) , including parsnips, has been used in our European Jewish family for hundred's of years?
Anyway, here is an important tip:
Use free range chicken not the grocery store chickens.  This will give your soup a much richer flavor.
Also, simmer slowly for several hours, this also makes the soup much richer.
If you are in a hurry, you can add some Lipton's Onion soup mix, this will definitely give it a jolt of flavor.
PS: I like floaters LOL
thank you for posting this old favorite

This is a wonderful recipe!  My mother and grandmother (both Jewish) made chicken soup like this ~ they never used garlic!  Always used parsnip, dill & parsley along with the other veggies.
The only difference ~ never cut up the onion,parsnip dill & parsley ~ threw it in and discarded after it was all cooked.. Actually they ate the parsnip!  
Also good with fine noodles instead of matzo balls!

Who needs Campbell's?!?!? This is easy to make and very good!  I opted to leave out the celery (not a fan) and added more garlic (whole cloves, not crushed) also used egg noodles in lieu of matzoh balls.  Didn't even have to "cut the chicken into pieces" because by the time I finished cooking it the chicken pretty much just fell to shredded pieces! (you do have to be VERY careful to pick out all of the small bones before returning the meat to the broth!).  I also added cooking sherry and parsley to my recipe.

We LOVE this soup!  As I type this I am making a huge batch for us as we are all sick.  This soup usually makes us feel better- settles upset tummies, clears out plugged up sinuses, and makes us sleepy.  The only change I make is that I use 3 medium onions, 3 parsnips, no carrots, and no matzo balls.  Per the suggestion of another person I stab the onions with a fork (I tried it with the parsnips today, too). Looking forward to a bowl of soup later!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I loved this soup althought the best thing for me was finding my mother's "heavy" matzo ball recipe.  Hers were sinkers too and we loved them.  She also never strained the soup but I guess with 5 hungry children, anything that filled the soup was a blessing.  Thank you so much for sharing this.

I tried this recipe twice. Once with the garlic and parsnips, once without the garlic and parsnips.  I liked the latter.  It's all about your personal taste, but it gave me a great foundation for lots of variations.  For the Matzo balls, I made them smaller than the average. Smaller than a walnut...  I like the little matzo balls and I also added some dried parsley to just give it a little color.  Everything was excellent!  Thank you!

I made this for my roommate, who came down with a nasty flu bug, and thought, "Holy cow, I'm going to have to freeze some", because it makes so darn much. Now, I'm extremely grateful it does, because roomie has passed the bug to me, and this soup is perfect for those under the weather days. I'm definitely saving this one.

This was wonderful, thank you. I've made stock previously but always boiled it for hours. I noticed a big difference with the simmering. Thank you, great tip! I didn't add the dill but only because we didn't have any. I strained the stock into another pot and then picked the meat off the bones when it was manageable. Unfortunately, I ate the legs/thigh with some salt because I'm such a guts but, hey, cook's treat! But I used the breast meat in the soup and everybody loved it. Thanks for sharing Layla! Great recipe :)

Bland, Matzoh bombs. OK for stock, soup was just OK.  Not much flavor.  I will try and jazz this up tomorrow.

Delicious and Easy!
The only change I would make is to try and remove as much of the skin from the chicken before throwing the chicken and veggies into the pot.  It just ended up being harder than I thought it would be to "skim the fat off".  
I cooked everything in the pot for three hours total and the bones were very easy to remove from the meat.  
Very yummy and has a large yeild. It will last me for days!

An easy & healthy soup.  We're always trying to incorporate more veggies in our diet & this soup helps us accomplish that. A low-fat dinner that everyone eats up.

Wow! This was truly a tasty recipe. It was an exact duplicate of my grandmothers soup but I never had the recipe. Unfortunately, I couldn't find matzo meal at our store here on Kauai, so I had to settle for the soup without the matzo balls, but it was wonderful! Thanks!

This is a variation  of the soup that I grew up with and it was tasty.  We are of eastern European decent (I'm first generation American) and want to comment about some of the criticism, especially regarding dill.  In my opinion, it's the dill that makes this Jewish Chicken Soup.  However, different regions make it different ways and to be a snob about what should or shouldn't be included is just plain wrong.  In Europe, especially during war time, people would put whatever they had into the soup so that they could stretch it out for several days.  Root vegetables were cheap and plentiful so parsnips, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, and anything else that could be cooked and eaten would find it's way into the soup.  So, to all of you soup "purists", have fun with it and understand that you are lucky to have the chicken!

The longer this soup simmers, the more delicious it gets (sometimes I even make it a full day in advance), so if you only have a couple hours until you need to serve this, you might want to think twice. The blend of flavors is unforgettable, particularly when they all soak into the matzoh balls. (I like to put the matzoh balls in at least an hour before I serve the soup.) One shortcut I take is using a rotisserie chicken (meat only) and canned broth rather than start from scratch with the whole chicken in the pot, and the soup always turns out amazing. I've made this with parsnips a couple of times with good results. You really can't go wrong with this soup!!

This recipe truly works!  I made this for my husband yesterday and this morning he was able to go back to work.  I made one substitution however, a chayote instead of parsnip.  He hates parsnips but loved how great the soup made him feel.  Thanks for this recipe, it was worth the time it took to make.

I’ve made two slow cooker batches this week — one for my house and one for my daughter’s because her family is fighting a bad flu and maybe pneumonia. Never leave out the garlic & parsnips. I add sliced shiitake mushrooms — not traditional but definitely healthful. I like to add fresh lemon juice to individual servings. I don’t make the matzohs but do add rice, wild rice or interesting gluten free noodles.

Wow! Great depth of flavor! Modified the recipe a bit. Purchased a roasted chicken and used chicken broth instead of water since I wasn't cooking the chicken.  Cooked the veggies for about an hour and 15 minutes. Added the chicken ast the 45 minute mark. Also added noodles to the soup. Excellent recipe. Thank you

Love this soup - It is easier than the soup I have always made and it tastes amazing. I ended up using a pre-mixed box of matzo balls; as the store didn't have matzoh meal to follow the recipe. Wish I had the matzoh meal now. My family loved the soup and I had a lot left over to freeze for another time. This is now my go-to recipe!

This is the matzah ball soup recipe that tastes most like the one I grew up with.  If you're looking for dense "sinker" style matzah balls, this is the recipe for you.  The flavor is really good and rich, though I use all chicken legs, rather than a whole chicken, which I feel gives a better result.  Also, I think 4 hours is a decent minimum, but I usually do 6 hours.  In a pinch, you get away with 2 hours by dropping in a bouillon cube or two at the end.

Doubled the veggies in the soup, used Rotisserie chicken for ease and flavor. Took off all the meat and then cooked the carcass and bones in the soup for 2 hours. Strained that out  and added in the shredded chicken. Matza balls were a little dense/dry maybe would add more liquid when making them.  Very tasty soup , will make again especially with a cold.

This was one of the most delicious soups I have ever had.  Hubby loved it.  Teenager loved and even the toddler kept coming back for more!  The only thing I did differently was no parsnips.  I also used a matzo ball and soup mix for the balls since apparently no one cooks jewish food around here.  Took a week to find it. Will have to special order matzo meal online because I will be making this everytime I make chicken soup!

Amazing, amazing, amazing.  We make a double batch and freeze quarts that we mix with manichewitz matzo ball soup whenever we want some awesome chicken soup!!!!
