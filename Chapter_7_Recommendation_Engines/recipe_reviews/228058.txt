5 star green beans that were absolutely outstanding.  I thought I had made enough for leftovers, but alas, I wandered into the kitchen the next morning to find my son standing in front of the open refrigerator door eating cold beans, one by one, for breakfast!  As his mouth was full, it was all the silent testimony I needed!  Thank you JulesDiner for the recipe.  It's already been logged in my favorites file!

I used far more bacon, but only because I started cooking without the recipe in front of me.  I would not call that a mistake because it turned out delicious.  Also, I did not use olive oil as I had plenty of fat to use with the rendering of the bacon. Beautiful balance of sweetness with the vinegar, but for my taste I might increase the vinegar-to-sugar ratio next time.  All in all, a terrific variation on a delicious greens recipe.  Next time, I will give it a go with collards!
Thanks, Jules!

Very good!  I didn't have cider vinegar, so used white.  Also more bacon!

My family loved these. We halved the recipe (only 3 of us) and it turned out great. No changes necessary!

Made these for for New Year's Day and they were a HUGE hit with my family! I had already cooked bacon on hand so I crumbled it and sauteed with the olive oil and onions. I used fresh grean beans and they turned out so tender and delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

I didn't have fresh green beans and their weren't any at the store so I used frozen green beans.  I didn't need as much liquid but they turned out wonderful.
