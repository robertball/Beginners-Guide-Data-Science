These are very similar to crepes but with less flour and eggs. The pan needs to be buttered between each pancake to facilitate easy flipping, they are very delicate, I used 1/3 cup measure but it ripped easily would recommend 1/2 cup measure. Served with strawberry jam and cinnamon sugar, my sons enjoyed them. Yielded 10 pancakes with 1/3 cup measure.
