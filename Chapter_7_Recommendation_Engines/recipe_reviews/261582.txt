Made this for dinner Wednesday night. I left out the pasta and used more eggplant as the base for the meaty sauce and it was still wonderful. I cut ribbons of eggplant in my veggie slicer and layered them as you would the pasta for a low carb variation that was just as delicious and filling.

I just loved this eggplant lasagna recipe. I'll be using this lasagna recipe from now on. I can't wait to try it again!
