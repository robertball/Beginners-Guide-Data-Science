This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I did not change the sauce recipe but added some other things to really get the dish I was craving.  I placed some fresh spinach in the bottom of our bowls, added the hot cooked noodles on top to lightly steam the spinach, then added some garlic cooked chicken.  I then topped it off with this yummy sauce, fresh tomato's, and shaved Parmesan.  This is a definite must keep recipe.  My kids keep asking when I plan on making it again!  Yeah, a kid favorite!

Great combination of flavors and the family gobbled it up.  I too added 1 lb. sausage and sauteed with the onion and garlic.  The chopped fresh basil on top really gave it a nice flavor.

I made this last night, It was assumed I had made the sauce from scratch so I didn't tell anyone differently :) Everyone loved it! I took the suggestion and added in zucchini. I used a bigger zucchini and would probably add more in next time ;)

fabulous recipe!  the whole family loved it!  can't wait to make this for my next get-together at the house:)  i did add a bit to it though, which made it even more amazingly tasty:)    when saute'ing the onions, i added 1/2 diced green bell pepper.  once soft, i threw in 1 lb  turkey sausage w/o the casing.  then chopped it up while sautee'ing into chunks.  10 min later once it cooked, i added in 1/2 pack of frozen "cut spinach" and 2 diced zucchini.  this way the meal becomes healthy for the family too:)  then add in the vodka and sauces.  and if you like flavor, when saute'ing the veggies, add 1 tspn italian seasoning, 1/2 spn paprika, salt, pepper, touch garlic pwder.   i'm SO happy to have stumbled upon this recipe!!!  thank you!!  the blend of both sauces is soo yummy!!  you better believe i'm gonna keep stock of these two Bertolli's sauces for when i'm in a bind.  next time, maybe i'll add a bit of heavy cream to it too:-)  xo

Absolutely awesome!  I love the blend of alfredo and red sauce.  I added 1 pound of sausage to this recipe as well.  Going to make it again tomorrow and throw a little Philly spread in it to make it even creamier!

I've been on the search for a vodka sauce since I had it in a restaurant in Montana of all places. I finally found something close. This sauce is awesome! I love it. It takes less than 20 minutes to prepare. I like to add frozen peas to it and serving it over penne. 

I wish I could vote more than once or give it 6 stars!

Wow! I've made a number of meals using recipes from here, but this sauce......wonderful! Easy, fast, tasty, and to somebody who doesn't see it being made, it appears you spent hours and hours making this sauce! I added fresh zucchini, mushrooms, and sausage meat. There was still some sauce left after the pasta was gone, and when I went to the kitchen to clean up after supper found the three sons standing around the pot with spoons eating the last of it without anything else! That alone makes it a 5 star recipe!

Oooh.... Sooooo yummy!!! Made this for dinner tonight. It's funny how seeing a picture of a particular dish or hearing someone else talk about it can make you CRAZY lol!!!!! On the commuter train from Chicago this past Friday, the train conductor (with whom me and my gal pals are friends with) described a dinner his wife was making that evening - pasta in a tomato vodka cream sauce with Italian sausage and fresh cherry tomatoes. I couldn't get that out of my mind all weekend (darn)! During my recipe search, I found this recipe and decided instantly that I had to give it a try. Never making a dish to the submitter's exact specificatitons, I couldn't help but make a few changes of my own. As everything came to a boil, I added about a cup's worth of halved grape tomatoes and 1/2 c. of frozen peas (cleaning out my freezer). The tomatoes were perfect (they pop when heated, so you get chunky little bits thruout... mmmmm...). My only other (two) minor changes were to add a t of red pepepr flakes for a little heat and instead of using plain alfredo sauce, I purchased garlic alfredo sauce. Fresh grated Romano cheese and chopped basil were perfect garnishes. Serving bowlfuls of pasta with slices of roosemary focaccia bread made this a perfect meal. :) No doubt, this will be a repeat at my house over and over again. Muy bueno! :-)

Surprisingly good-I didn't have high hopes for bottled alfredo but it looked like something the kid would like and I needed something I could throw  together fast. I did use white wine instead of vodka but other that that made it as is. The potential for add in is great-spinach, chicken, sausage, you could dress this up really easily. I think I'll be adding a couple jars of Bertolli to my pantry for fast suppers!

This stuff is great and so easy to make. A nice extra touch is to finely chop a couple of spicy Italian sausages (remove casing), and throw it into the sauce.

Wonderful! Followed as written. Used bowtie pasta. Heated plates in oven and placed fresh spinich leaves on plate before dishing pasta. Really added nice touch and color.

My husand and son walked in the house and said that dinner smelled incredible.  I also added italian sausage - husband and son wanted tolick their plates - my son put this as one of his top five dinners (wow).  I took a little more than I could eat, but the other two fought over who would finish my dinner.  Great recipe. I'm planning on making it for a party next week- cook it, put it in a crock pot and just enjoy the comments from afar.  Easy to make. (made it with the chicken broth).

Tried this last night, with some modifications from previous reviewers - it was delicious!!  I started with 1lb ground Italian sausage, added half an onion (diced) when the sausage was almost done, 2 zucchini (diced) when the onions were almost done. Could've used a touch more garlic, but I love to cook with garlic - start with 1tsp minced (or one clove) and go from there.  The vodka went 30sec after the zucchini, then the tomato and alfredo sauces.  Very very very good, I'm going to make this again tonight for a different audience!

Very good!  AND EASY!!  I skipped the onion because of my kids and browned up some chicken strips (seasoned w/ salt & pepper) in place of the onions then added the garlic, vodka etc. like the recipe says.  My kids actually liked it - they are 6 and 3 and VERY picky.  More importantly my husband had two helpings!!!!
