I baked a trio of desserts for New Year's Eve, and this Amaretto ice cream complemented the Kahlua Brownies I baked extremely well. I had to omit the vanilla extract bc I ran out of it and didn't want to go to the market. Thankfully, it was a hit, and I will be putting this ice cream recipe in heavy rotation. Thanks so much for a simple, easy, no fuss recipe!

Really easy and fantastic recipe. I ended up using 3c of heavy cream because I didn't have half and half on hand. It was rich and creamy and delicious! A little scoop goes a long way. Will definitely be making this again.

Very easy and good recipe. I didnâ€™t have half and half, so I used heavy cream instead. I cut down sugar to 1/2 cup, but will reduce it even more next time. In my opinion all recipes have too much sugar. I had this ice cream with a warm cookie brownie and it was delicious.
