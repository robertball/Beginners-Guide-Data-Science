This recipe is wonderful!  I added a pecan crust.  The combination was great.  I omitted the lemon zest and changed the lemonade concentrate to 1/2 cup.  Got many requests for the recipe.  Very refreshing!

This was pretty good. I used regular cream cheese as that's what I had on hand. I tried a lemonade dessert years ago that I fell in love with, and have not been able to find any recipe that matches it. But, this was definately good and I will make it again.

Like another reviewer I was looking for a lost recipie ( Grannie's "Lemon Delight"- grm crkr crust/frozen condensed milk/whipped semi-set lemon jello). This looks like a great up-dated version. I expect to come back and up-grade rating to 5 star after serving it to the purists in the family. Expect mods.

It was pretty tasty. Similar to cheesecake, but no crust. It was very sweet, though. Maybe a little too much for my taste. Still, I might make it again.

This was SO easy and tasty. Great for a hot summer night when someone else in the household ate all the ice cream and forgot to replace it.  Grandkids loved it. used the rest of lemonade can to make lemonade with 1/3 less water. I grated the lemon rind, but, will probably leave it out next time and use as a garnish instead. The creamy texture with the chewy bits didn't work for me.  May try similar concocotions with other frozenjuice blends and jellos.

This is tasty! I used low fat and sugar free ingredients so the cream cheese didn't blend as well as I would have liked, but the flavor is still perfectly lemon.

Loved this!  Make sure you get the cheese really smooth before you start adding the dissolved jello, and incorporate it slowly to keep the cheese from lumping.

At first I was afraid this was not going to setup and jell but it did.  It was so good, refreshing and simple to make.  I made my whip cream and cut down on the sugar added to the heavy cream.  This cut down on the total sweetness to the dish as well otherwise it would have been too sweet for me.

Delicious!! Made this for Easter to rave reviews.  I filled the center of the ring mold with fresh strawberries which were a beautiful compliment to the lemon flavor of the dish.  Will definitely make again.

Light summertime dessert! I prepare in lightly greased muffin tin rather than the mold. At serving time, slide each “muffin” on to a dessert plate and top with a sprig of mint and fresh blueberries... this dessert is always a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

I will definitely make this again! I took it to a family gathering and EVERYONE loved it! It was perfect for a hot day. I left out the lemon rind after reading some reviews and I don't have any regrets.

I had to make a few changes (no frozen lemonade available so I made a heavy simple syrup and add juice and pulp of a few lemons) and substituted cream cheese. Also put it in a no bake graham cracker crust. This was absolutely perfect for a hot summer day dessert. The lemon wasn't overpowering and it was like eating a lemon cheesecake. I will make it again but may try low fat cream cheese.

I've taken this to 3 occasions.  It's a hit with every crowd.
I dressed it up with roasted pecan crust & whole roasted pecans on top in a geometric pattern, I drizzled roasted blueberries/juice over the top when I poured it into a 9x9 pan one time, and this last time I added 1/4 scraped vanilla bean into almond crust. Vanilla extract would probably be great too; I just needed to use up the vanilla bean.
This is a recipe I will riff on for years.  Thank you.
