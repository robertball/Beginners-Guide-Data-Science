Nice cookie, and a welcome change from the "same ol' same ol."  I made them twice the size directed, and got 24.  A little sweet, but that's what a cookie's supposed to be and that's what milk is for! And the extra sweetness certainly could be because I added a cup of coconut. I made a half recipe, to which I added 1/2 tsp. salt to heighten flavor, and didn't bother melting the butter. The traditional method of creaming the butter and sugars worked just fine.  I baked my second batch longer, as I, unlike most people I know, prefer mine a little crispier. My only criticism is that they came out a little flatter than I prefer, and I even chilled the dough first. All and all, a pretty darn good cookie with a nice crackly top, and chewy texture from the oats and corn flakes.

I've been making "Dunkin' Platters" for years now! My nieces & nephews (and all of their friends) *LOVE* them!!! Add 3/4 cup of chocolate chips for the kids or raisins & nuts for the grumps. I guarantee you will have people asking you for the recipe! This one is a keeper!!!!

I did not know what kind of cookie this was. I had been trying out new choc chip and oatmeal all week. This was such a nice surprise. I loved the taste they were crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I did add nuts and raisens. I REALLY like this one. Mary

I have been making this recipe for over 30 years and I have never had anything but compliments.  I add coconut, raisins and chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans).  If you want a crisp cookie, leave them in the oven a little longer.  If you want a chewy cookie, take them out slightly under-done.

I have just made the batter for half a batch of these...As is, the batter is entirely too runny to yield cookies, so I had to add 1/2 cup more oats (this would be 1 cup for full recipe) and 1 more cup of cornflakes (2 cups for full recipe) to achieve a scoopable texture (original batter would have run together on the cookie sheet - maybe this is due to the melted butter/margarine?  maybe creaming would have been the way to go?).  I will update the review when these are baked (they are currently chilling in the fridge). UPDATE*** I should not have added the 1/2 cup extra oats, as this made the cookies a bit caky (cornflakes didn't affect the consistency).  However, the reason for the deduction of 1 star is not the batter (this is due to my changes, and not the fault of the recipe) but the fact that I could taste the baking soda in the final product (and I had already made sure to use a bit less than the 1 tsp specified for the half recipe).  NEXT TIME I WILL CREAM THE BUTTER, AND DECREASE THE SODA

Yummy!  I made these yesterday, and they were delicious. They come out flat, chewy, and great for dunking!  They also freeze well.

These cookies were made by a teacher in high school.  They were so good. I have seen tons of recipes for it and this is the closet I have seen.  :)

I am in the Peace Corps and dont have access to many ingredients- I was thankful for these cookies.  I used melted margarine instead of butter and it turned out fine.  I also had to chill the dough for a little bit before it was workable (i live in a very hot and humid area).  My boyfriend ate the whole batch the day I made them!  Great!

Cut the recipe in half, and still ended up with plenty of cookies for the family.  We enjoyed the chewiness of the oats and the crunch of the cornflakes.  My husband, who always samples the dough, said it was the best dough ever.

I halved the recipe, substituted pumpkin in place of the butter, and used refrigerated egg product.  I forgot to only use half of the bag of cholocate chips, though!  I guess that's what you get for trying to be healthy.  So, they're almost too chocolatey to taste anything else, but they're good :)

Did not like these too much....they are a crispy cookie and I prefer chewy/doughy.  I cut the recipe in half and added half a bag of chocolate chips.  Glad I added the chips or they would have been very bland.

Added 1 c butterscotch chips and 3/4 c mini choc chips. I didn’t melt the butter in the first step bc I’m not sure why you would do that. Amazing cookies!!!

Excellent. You do not need to do all the changes mentioned here. The cookie is fine just like it's written. If you don't want them flat, DO NOT GREASE YOUR PAN. Nothing in my book more offensive than changing someone's recipe and telling them about it imho. Husband loves these!!

My new favorite cookie.  Love the initial crisp and then chewy center.  Terrific!  I use walnuts and mini m&m's in mine.  They're addicting!

This recipe is a hit! I have made these since I was a little girl, and have always loved the brown sugar flavor! I have come to love Special K (instead of cornflakes and Watkins Vanilla Nut flavoring (instead of vanilla). I do add 2 T more of flour, oatmeal, and cereal to beef them up slightly.
