These were quite good and very easy.  I actually used a box of hot roll mix instead of the frozen bread dough and it worked just fine.

Yum!  Very easy rolls but packed with flavor!  I used the soft garlic breadsticks dough from here, which packed in a bit more flavor.  I also used green olives w pimento since I don't have kalamata.  Worked very well-yyou can see, and taste all the flavors, and I love the combo. Bf doesn't like olives but that's his loss. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good.  I added more olives than called for.  They took longer to rise than stated.
