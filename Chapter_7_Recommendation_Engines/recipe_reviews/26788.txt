As the recipe is written, I give it 3 stars. With a few changes, I give it 5 stars (so I'll officially award it 4 stars)! First, I used three ripe Jersey tomatoes, by far the best out there.  I used just one large green bell pepper, one medium sized sweet onion and one fresh jalepeno pepper.  I added more lemon juice to taste, and lots of fresh cilantro.  I also added kosher salt to taste.  The original recipe had too much green pepper and subsequently not enough tomato. It needed salt desperately, as it was very bland. Also, it tastes much better the next day, it needs to marinate. My family is enjoying it, and I plan to keep making it as long as there are Jersey tomatoes out there!

This salsa was a little bland as written, but I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, some salt, and substituted lime juice for the lemon and it turned out great! I will definately make this one again.

This is a great salsa.  I left out the bell peppers and added salt, black pepper, and olive oil.  I also exchanged the lemon juice for lime juice to give a more authentic taste.  I would make this again.

What to do with all those tomatoes? Make salsa ofcourse! BUT I made many changes (based on spices I'd seen used in other salsa recipe's from this site): I used more tomatoes but also some S&P, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, and 1 TBLS wht sugar. After chilling a few hours, the flavors really blended well and we enjoyed the salsa very much. I'll still be looking for that "perfect" salsa but this was good and very easy to make. Thanks Kandi!

Excellent! Not like any of those using canned tomatoes. Ugh!! I also made this for my fussy kids substituting cucumber for the peppers. They loved it.

Finally; a totally fresh salsa which I've been looking for a long time. What a refreshing treat.  I blended mine in a food processor though.  I doubled the garlic; processed this first then added the chopped onions, and jalapenos, cilantro and lemon juice and pulsed to smooth.  Lastely added the tomatoes; and just pulsed to consistency preferred.  Tons of fresh flavour; a totally authentic mexican treat.  Thanks for a great recipe

My picky husband actually raved about this salsa. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the recipe on its own was too bland, and I messed with it, adding salt, black pepper, and subsituting the lemon juice with lime juice. Next time I make this, I think I will add garlic, too. A great basic salsa, though.

This was super, I added the juice of a lime and it was a big hit.  I think it would also be good poured over chicken and baked which I will try.  Thanks for the receipe Kandi.

You can't go wrong with fresh salsa! We had huge quantites to tomatoes to get rid of, so this used up a bunch! I use salsa as an excuse to clean out my fridge; garlic, corn, cilantro, basil, shallots... all those things I got a lot of in the garden and wanted to use up... I don't have a recipe; I use whatever's on hand.

Salsa was good. I used lime juice instead of lemon.  Didn't have cilantro so I used nothing but I think it would have made it better.  It was good though.  THanks!

This is almost identical to the one I make which I learned when we were in Mexico. The only difference is they use lime and I think that is more authentic. But it turns out perfect every time. To make more colorful, I use different colored peppers if I can. But I wouldn't add garlic or sugar, just some salt.

I like that this recipe is so simple and that I can change it up as needed. (I used banana peppers this time, for instance.) I also used lime juice instead of lemon and prefer that.

It was ok, but I added some red onion to this, along with some olive oil, a little more salt, green onion, and rather then a bunch of Green bell peppers, for looks I added some small sweet peppers, which made it colorful and awsome. Instead of Lemon I substituted lime juice.

i ommited the bell pepper and added a pinch cumin, a splash of olive oil, and twice as much lemon juice.  Made a half recipe and used the salsa in burritos.  Smelled great, tasted great, hubby loved it.  I will make this again.

It was good, but there was a little too much onion, & it needed more tomato and to be spicier. Maybe next time, I'll add a can of diced tomato, and/or some tomato paste. The cilantro & lime juice was awesome, though.

I made a lot of changes to this because I was missing ingredients.  It came out great anyway.  I only used 1 pepper and 1/2 an onion.  More than that seems like it would overpower the tomato.  Didn't have fresh cilantro so used 1 tsp. dry cilantro.  Added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  Didn't have jalopeno so omitted.  Exchanged lemon juice with lime juice.  This tasted very good to me, but for those who followed the exact recipe, it may not be as good.

This is a VERY refreshing salsa. Key is fresh ingredients - and I used all organic. I did revise slightly, 3 tomatoes and 1 green bell pepper, only because as I was making it 1 green pepper seemed to be enough for my taste, but there wasn't enough tomato so added another. I will try adding a dash of salt, pepper, and fresh garlic next time for a little bit more flavor -- but the fresh veggies by themselves were really great. This is a keeper! :)

Execllent! This salsa is easy and very fresh-tasting.  I added more cilantro, but other than that I made it "as is."  I got several requests for the recipe.

Okay, I tried this recipe again with my overflow of veggies from my garden!  Love it!  I didn't have lemon juice so I used fresh lime juice.  I don't like cilantro very much, so I just added enough to give it some flavor!  Turned out great this time!  (Definately do not add garlic as someone else suggested, really over powers all the fresh flavors!)

There's nothing better than fresh salsa. This one is right on the money. I used two jalapenos, and lime juice instead of the lemon. Perfecto!

I had never made salsa before, but had lots of tomatoes. This was very good. I did follow some of the suggestions and I added garlic, and left out the celantro. My kids raved about it.

This tasted much better than I thought it would when I started making it. Some ppl may like it without salt but I needed to add salt.

Perfect combination of ingredients, I actually added a little tomato sauce and paste to give it more of a "soupy" consistency.  Received a lot of compliments for it.

My husband really loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to add salt and more garlic.  Otherwise, very good recipe and good way to use the overabundance of tomatoes from our garden.

This was very fresh-tasting and flavorful.. I would recommend a good food chopper, though. I spent forever chopping.  My fiance prefers the saucier pre-cooked salsa, but this is great as far as fresh salsa goes.  I added black beans to mine and it gave it a nice texture contrast and flavor.  I would make this again.

This is a good, basic recipe for salsa. It does need salt (went with 1/4 tsp., as tortilla chips provide some salt), and I used less green pepper, onion, and way less jalapeno. Added a pinch of sugar, and substituted lime juice for lemon. Lastly, saw a little jar at the store of chopped garlic in extra virgin olive oil, and added 1/4 tsp. of this. Voila!

I used jalapenos and banana peppers instead of green pepper and a couple shakes of garlic salt for flavor. Great way to use tomatoes out of garden! Thanks for recipe.

Was a really good recipe. I substituted one of the green peppers for a red one and added a bit more lemon as well as some balsamic vinegar. Will definitely make it again

This was a great recipe.  I made it for my daughters' graduation party because she is a 'crazy salsa lover'.  The guests raved about it.
