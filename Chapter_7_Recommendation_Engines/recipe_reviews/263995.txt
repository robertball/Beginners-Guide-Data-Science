Dinner guests loved it—-asked for recipe!  

Made this on a worknight for a dinner party. I thought it would an easy one to make on a busy night. So the night before, I made up the dough up to the first rising and popped it into the fridge overnight. The next day, I took it out after returning home from work, and took it through the next steps, letting it rise a little longer since the dough was cold. 
Made it into 6 rolls instead of 5. They turned out just as expected—-great texture inside and out and a great flavor. Will definitely make them again!
