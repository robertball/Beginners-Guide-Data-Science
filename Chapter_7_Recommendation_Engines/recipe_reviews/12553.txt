Splendifirous in it's own right, this creamy yet subtle cottage cheese pie has both texture and flavour, as well as a great eye for fashion (haw! haw!). Of course, it should be teamed with blueberries to add a fruity, playful side to the special evening.

This was good. I added canned cherries on top after it was done. I also used a graham cracker crust.

Are you kidding me?  This recipe is absolutely, positively, FANTASTIC!!! When I took it out of the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes, I tasted it.  That's it.  It was all over.  I sat there by myself and devoured half of the pie.  I din't have chopped walnuts in the house, but the almonds worked just fine. Had someone asked me for a taste, I would have told them to take out the baby spoon and that's all you get. I wouldn't rate this recipe a 5 star, but I would rate it a 10 star!!!
