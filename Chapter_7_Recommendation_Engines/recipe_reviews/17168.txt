I have been looking for this recipe since having it at Ruby Tuesday s. This is definately not it. I ve tried eliminating the velveeta & sour cream & instead using an alfredo sauce. It s closer to the original but I can t seem to get that southwestern cheese flavor even after adding southwest seasoning. Hopefully someone can come up with that cheese sauce.

This recipe is NOT a good example of the actual Ruby Tuesday's entree. 

I would not recommend this dish.

Good recipe! I thought the sauce was a little rich and it could have used more hot sauce but other than that my husband & I thought it was "restaurant quality!"

This was pretty darn good. My husband cooked it and used about 8 oz. Velveeta and a can of drained diced tomatoes with green chilies in place of the chopped tomatoes because that's what we had on hand. I don't think we'll add any more Velveeta next time...the sauce was great and we LOVE cheese! Quick and easy and VERY filling! Thanks Bernadette!

For those who think this is too cheesy tasting or too much sour cream I can only say "well duh!" If you don't like those two ingredients you definitely won't like this recipe and shouldn't even try it. My husband and I thought this was FANTASTIC! The first thing he said was that it LOOKED really nice. It tasted even better. Next time I'll use another can of beans and at least one more piece of chicken. The cheese sauce would also be great as a dip for chips or vegetables.

I tried this recipe as is...I cook a lot so I know what I'm doing. The cheese made it have a gritty texture and it just did not have a good flavor. I was very dissapointed and we ended up throwing it out. I would not reccomend this to anyone.

Not bad. You must like cheese before even starting this recipe. I used only 8oz of cheese and added a dash of garlic/onion powder into the sauce. Also I made a blackened chicken recipe (and more of it) to place on top. Don't think I'd make this again but I don't regret trying it either. My family seems to agree with this decision.

This is a decent starter recipe but it needs some tweaking and I'm not sure yet how to go about it. The problem is the cheese: you can't get past the Velveeta taste even when you cut the amount in half. No amount of sour cream can disguise that decidedly fake cheese taste. Additionally it's pretty gross when if you have leftover cheese sauce it has congealed into a solid block of goo in the pan. I think the answer might lie in combining sour cream with the spices (and adding chile powder) and mixing in some shredded cheese and then just warm it to serving temperature. The cheese won't be melted but I think it'd have a more natural flavor.

Ruby Tuesday's version of this is my very favorite dish in the whole world. This is not it however it is tastey. I have tried to subsitute Montery Jack instead of the processed cheese. It did not melt as smoothly as I would have liked but this is a great recipe to experiment with and it will still come out rather well.

I made this using a jar of nacho cheese sauce (from the salsa aisle) instead of Velveeta then just added the sour cream and the beans and a 1/2 cup of grated cheese. I didn't need to add any other spices. I don't know what it tastes like at Ruby Tuesdays but it tasted to us like macaroni and cheese made with nacho cheese sauce--and I hate to say that my family loved it!

I had this dish at a restaurant and it was so good that I wanted to make it at home. I looked it up on this website and made it. It was really close to what I got at the restaurant. Simple to make and taste great. It gave us a little variety in our regular weekly menu!

This recipie was "okay". It was really cheesey but a great way to use leftover grilled chicken. Only one our of three kids liked this dish so I won't be serving it again.

I agree to the people who "cant get over the Velveeta taste".. Well this recipe is not for you! I found this recipe after looking for something to cook to use up my chunk of processed cheese food. (Not Velveeta brand either.) I had to halve the recipe b/c I didn't have a pound of the stuff in fact I didn't even have 1/2 pound but I improvised. I added a mexican spice blend to the cheese sauce (the fresh stuff you squeeze out of a tube) and it gave the sauce such an intense good heat! I will definitely make this dish again if I come across Velveeta that I need to use up. I would even feed this to guests it was delicious!!! Overall easy recipe to tweak or add to if need be so don't worry if you don't have all the ingredients down to a T. I would suggest trying to make the sauce spicy or at least mild it takes away from the processed cheese flavor that so many people don't love.

a fabulous chicken recipe! I made this for my husband for father's day and I felt like we had ordered take-out from a restaurant! It takes a little while to prepare but is well worth the effort and time. It is amazing! Great for special occasions - very impressive looking and tasting.

We enjoyed the recipe but found the sauce to be to cheesy. We used half of the cubed cheese(8oz) and used condensed cream of chicken soup undiluted. We also added one half package of burrito seasoning and chili paste(2T)instead of the pepper flakes/sauce and finally topped with fresh basil.

It was pretty good. My husband thought it needed more "zip" and had too much of a sour cream taste. I liked it but also thought the sour cream taste was a little too strong.

This is pretty good. I don't recommend substituting plain yogurt for sour cream in this case; heating it up to make the sauce did something funny to the texture. Next time I will use more cheese sour cream and more black beans and then it will be 5 stars! I also added some chipotle salsa to it at the end. Thank you.

If you want this to taste more like the real deal add more spices!! I can't even tell you how much hot sauce and red pepper I added. I just kept tasting and adding more. Otherwise it tasted great and it was a very hearty meal!

Sonora Chicken Pasta is one of my favorite restaurant dishes... this version needs serious help. Even with three times the spices it tastes overwhelmingly like processed cheese. Even my single male "I'll eat anything" friend turned his nose up at it. Also it dirties up four separate pots assuming you broil the chicken instead of grilling it.

This was ok. Kind of reminded me of mac and cheese. The black beans didn't mesh well with this dish. I feel exactly like Dreginek don't regret trying it but won't bother to make it again.

My kids destroyed this dish! I made a few changes: I used 12oz Velveeta and a full 14oz jar of alfredo sauce instead of sour cream; 1 1/2 tsp Cholula hot sauce instead of a dash; a can of Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chilies instead of the two tomatoes. Also baked the chicken in adobo seco. This recipe needs to be tweaked for your family's tastes but couldn't have done it without this recipe as a starting point. A que bueno!!

I really like this recipe but it is very rich so don't pile your plate like I did the first time I had this. You won't eat it all. It does make very nice leftovers. My family liked it too.

I fell in love with this after having it at Ruby Tuesday's many years ago. I agree with others in that it's not the exact recipe but close to my recollection. I did add more hot sauce and crushed red pepper. We like it with a definite kick!

This was better than the restaurant version. However I made the following changes: Seasoned very think chicken breasts with salt red pepper and poultry seasoning and fried the chicken breasts in olive oil and poured the olive oil and chicken into a bowl. Instead of plain cheese I used velveeta mexican cheese sour cream and a litte heavy cream once the cheese started melting. I used diced tomatoes with chilies instead of plain diced tomatoes and fresh cilantro instead of green onions. It was creamy and just spicy enough. One of our favorite dishes.

I tried this and didn't like it at all. I prefer mine and like some others I took a clue to mine from Ruby Tuesdays because they took it off their menu there. I love it so naturally had to make my own.

This recipe is a good clone for Ruby Tuesday's signature dish. I added tomatoes as in the original dish; my family really enjoyed it. Overall a good recipe and one I will prepare again. Thanks for submitting this.

I used to work at Ruby Tuesday and ate the Sanora often. Unfortunately this recipe is not even close. The sauce is much to thick and too rich. The sour cream really cuts the heat which is what made the Sanora at ruby's so good. If I try this recipe again I will make a Queso with the velveeta and rotel then toss the pasta in it. Then top it with the chicken black beans and tomatoes.

I have the recipe from Ruby Tuesdays and they make a simple white sauce first add cubed velveeta then add taco sauce with a dash of hot sauce. I have substituted the white sauce and velveeta with a jar of cheese sauce found next to the spaghetti sauce and a dash of taco sauce with the hot sauce. It was much simpler to make and didn't take as long.

Good recipe but I don't use sour cream in the cheese sauce I use evaporated milk w/flour and a little butter and add 1 tbsp cider vinegar and 1-2 tsps cumin instead of worcestershire or hot sauce really helps with the overwhelming cheesy flavor. I use a can of chopped green chilis and hot sauce in my bean mixture to get the spicy flavor into the dish.

I was a fan of the Sonora Chicken Pasta at Ruby Tuesday then they stopped making it. I think I like this recipe better. I made it as it is written with the addition of 1/2 cup of onion 1 minced garlic clove and 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup water into the cheese sauce as I prepared it. I also just used a can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 tomatoes. Very tasty. If you want more of a spicy taste add a little bit more hot pepper sauce onto the combined product.

This was pretty awesome!!! I have been looking for a recipe like this for a while now. I use to always get this pasta from Ruby Tuesdays when they had it but they currently no longer have this on their menu. I did however make one slight change to the posters recipe. I added flank steak instead of chicken.
