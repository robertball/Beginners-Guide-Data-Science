Definite 5 stars on this one, both for the ease and flavor! Almost exactly like that pricey affogato I get from my favorite coffee shop. Makes the perfect after-dinner dessert. So many possible variations using different flavors of ice cream and cold brew.  I used vanilla bean Halo Top (for a healthier, low-carb and low-sugar option) and plain House Blend Gevalia cold brew.  The following night I used chocolate Halo Top. Delicious! I can also see adding in a bit of liqueur of your choice. -- This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I wouldn't have thought something so simple could be so insanely delicious! I used the vanilla flavored coffee concentrate and used Halo top vanilla ice cream and I was getting caramel notes -like someone squirted a lot of caramel in it!! It's so good!!!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Delicious! Easy, creamy and refreshing. I could see this also being good with a little vanilla or hazelnut syrup. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Simple and a perfect treat on a warm day. Couldn't be easier to make and works great with other ice cream flavors like chocolate, cookies & cream and dark chocolate raspberry. Will make again! This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Could not have been easier, and I loved how the House Blend coffee tasted with the vanilla ice cream. No other sweeteners or creamers needed!  This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Wonderful!  I used low calorie Vanilla Bean ice cream and Gevalia Vanilla Iced Coffee Concentrate- this would be great with the Caramel flavor as well!

Very yummy! But I took it a step further and added caramel Irish cream to it and a swirl of caramel syrup on top--so good! I'm not a fan of maraschino cherries, so I left that off. Thanks for the idea, Paula! --Update-I just tried this with chocolate ice cream, and Oh My Word, it is good! :) *This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I've made this a few times now. Think of it as a cold brewed affogato. It's perfect for summer parties. I used homemade ice cream which I put in the glasses I intended to use for serving. This way, when you're ready to serve, just add the coffee. I put out toppings and my guests came up with some great ideas: toasted coconut, smarties (M&Ms), chocolate covered vodka infused  cherries (my niece is a genius), and even dark rum and raisins. Excellent idea Paula, thank you for sharing it. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

We used the caramel flavored Gevalia Cold Brew with vanilla ice cream. I expected the coffee flavor to be overwhelming but my ice cream had melted enough that it was perfect. It's so easy, it's perfect for when you want a treat or have company.

So easy to make yet so flavorful. This could be dangerously addictive. Despite all the legal jumble at the end of this review I can honestly say that this is my true and honest opinion. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Super simple and refreshing! This came together in a snap and made the perfect after dinner treat, though I could have this any time of day and be perfectly happy! I liked that it wasn't super sweet and the cherry on top was the perfect accompaniment. I will definitely be making this one again~YUM!!!!
