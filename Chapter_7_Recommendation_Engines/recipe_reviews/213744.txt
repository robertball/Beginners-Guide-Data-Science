This recipe was fabulous!  I started the rice first, and it was ready about the same time I finished the chole.  It's quite spicy, but even my 2 1/2 yr old liked it.  I didn't have the cilantro or serranos, but it was still great.  Don't skip the tomatoes and fresh ginger root!  They cut the heavy spice and rounded out the flavors nicely.

It was good, as is, but when a friend suggested serving it with raita, oh yeah, that put it over the top!  I happened to have some pre-made, but imagine in a pinch just some plain yogurt, mint and cucumber on the side would make this a 5 star dish.

This is great!  I serve it over a bed of Romain lettuce to increase the amount of food per serving and reduce the calorie count.

Very surprisingly delicious. I used store bought chhole    masala & added ginger & tomatoes last and then pressure cooked more. Loved it because I did not expect much out the recipe :-).

Wow.  Fantastic.  Served this with Curried Coconut Chicken from this website and the two were fantastic together!!  (Not to mention a side of white rice and rainbow sherbet for dessert!!)  Had my friend and her family over and everyone loved it--she even asked me for the recipe!  My husband thought it was perfect.  This will definitely be made over and over again!  Thanks for the amazing share!!  Oh, I didn't use either of the chiles--I'm not a huge fan.  I did use some red pepper (about 1/2 tspn) which was just the right amount of kick for me.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and everything was delicious!

I am going to try this again and hopefully give it 5 stars--totally my fault for not knowing the peppers being used but this was waaaay too spicy. I will use different ground red chilies (i used habanero) and maybe a smaller serrano pepper (the one I got from the grocery was quite large).
