I am giving this a five star rating just because it tastes so wonderful!! But there are some serious adjustments needed to make it come out. First of all there is NO WAY this recipe will fit into an 8x8 pan. Must go into a 9x13 pan. Second I took some other peoples advice and put the caramel on top of the apples, not on top of the crumb topping, would recommend doing that! On the bag of caramels I used it had a recipe for caramel apples, which said to add 4 tablespoons of regular milk to each 48 caramels so I did that rather than open a whole can of evap. milk and waste what I didn't use, and it was just fine. With a few changes, will definitely make this recipe again. YUM!YUM!!

As the name implies it IS the best ever. I have a few suggestions for everyone.  use a ziploc bag.  make the filling, peel and cut the apples then add the apples to the ziploc bag pour in the filling and let marinate while you finish with the rest of the recipe.  apples and sauce can even be made the night before and refrigerated.  dont forget to double the lemon juice and cinnamon for the sauce. Instead of using flour use vanilla pudding, one box is a half cup. homemade caramel is the best and easiest way to go, medium high heat in a large saucepan stick of butter, cup of sugar and 1.25 cups of heavy cream added slowly and after the sugar turns a nice golden brown.  you will have some left over that can be put in a jar and used on ice cream or French toast, mmmm.  half the crumble recipe and add a dash of cinnamon.  instead of water for the sauce use another liquid i.e. brandy, heavy cream, cider.  the last 10 - 15 minutes of bake time sprinkle 1/4 - 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the top, its adds a great crunch.

This recipe is delicious and I will definitely make it again, only with a couple of tweaks.  One, the pan needs to be larger and should be sprayed with pam or greased first, second the caramel definitely needs to go on top of the apple mixture before the crumb topping.  I used caramal syrup, the kind you would put on ice cream, and just warmed it in the microwave (lid off) to warm it so it would be easier to pour, it took about half a bottle.  This is delicious served hot with whipped cream on top, my family loved it!

I made this today for a dessert and followed the advice of past reviewers. I used a 9x13 baking dish, doubled the cinnamon, added nutmeg and allspice. I also doubled the lemon juice, omitted the water and added Mexican vanilla. I poured pre-made caramel sauce - about a 1/4 cup - over the apples and then put the crumble mixture on. It came out great...sweet but not overpowering. The top was crispy and the apple mixture was a perfect texture (not mushy at all). The taste was spot on. I served it warm with a drizzle of caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! I will add this to my list of seasonal apple recipes. Thank you, St. Matthew First Graders!

I may not make it again, but it was good. Our "large apples" must have been bigger than the author's, because we  had to use a 13"x9"x2" pan. There was no "Crisp" because of the caramel (we used a tub of fat-free caramel apple dip). If I made it again, I'd add more spice (apple pie spice) to the apples and layer the caramel below the crisp. I would use the caramel apple dip again, though. Oh, and the tip to line the pan with foil to avoid a messy clean-up is a good one!

great recipe. Used some of the tips from other bakers like putting the caramel on top of the apples and i used the caramel dip found in the veggie section of the grocery store.  this cut down on messy dishes.  Also browned the crisp topping in the broiler for a couple of minutes and it turned out fabulous.  Thanks so much

This was definitely the best apple crisp I have ever made.  I used more cinnamon, and a little more flour in the topping (I like it crumblier) and used store bought caramel topping cause I was low on time.  It was absolutely delicious.  I am 5 mos. pregnant right now, so I probable could've eaten the whole thing.  YUM!

I am giving this recipe only two stars as it is a disaster to clean up! It was tasty and everyone liked the flavor of the caramels, but the mess it made in my pan, took hours of soaking in boiling water and scrubbing! I strongly recommend that if you are going to try this, line your pan with HEAVY foil and then grease the foil, before putting the apples mixture in the pan.
    I will not make this again,think I will stick with my regular recipes.

This was a wonderful dish.  Based on other reviews and our own tastes, I upped the amount of cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg and allspice, used the pre-made light caramel apple dip instead of melting candies and put the crumb topping on last.  Very sweet but excellent as a fall dessert.

I'd never made an apple crisp before so can't say if this is the "best ever" but it's really good! And quite easy to make, the most difficult and time consuming part was peeling apples. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a 9x13 pan, increased the cinnamon, put the caramel under the crumble, and used 1 packet of instant vanilla pudding in place of some of the flour in the crumble. I also used apple juice instead of water in the apple mixture, and added a splash of vanilla extract. It was a bit on the 'too sweet' side, but I did use way more caramel than a 'drizzle' so my fault! Everyone liked it though, my brother had two big pieces even after commenting that it was really sweet.

I followed the recipe "as is" but 5 apples was not going to do the trick; maybe saying fill your pan high of cut apples, as they cook down and makes room for the crumble...the only other thing I did was add more cinnamon - the more the healthier! (cinnamon is good for you!)..cleanup was not a problem, not sure why others are having issues; maybe having more apples that what it calls for soaked up the sticky stuff?  Eat on, my friends- this one's a keeper!

recipe is delicious but I have a few suggestions that really make it a five star rating for me: Drizzle the caramel over the apple mixture THEN top with the crumb mixture. Makes the crumb top stay crunchy. Use only about 1/2 of the caramel mixture. Save the rest for another use.  12 servings? yes, if they're small. I'd say 6-8 servings is more realistic

I made this for my family's thanksgiving dessert. It is amazing! I followed the advice of other reviewers. I marinated the apple mixture all day in a ziploc bag in the fridge. I doubled the lemon juice and cinnamon, and added a pinch of nutmeg. I made homemade caramel sauce with butter, sugar, and heavy cream. I added the caramel sauce before the crumble, and used a 9x13 dish. I also sprinkled on some chopped pecans during the last 15 minutes of baking time. Served with homemade whipped cream from the heavy cream I had left over. Delicious and perfect consistency the very first time I made it!

This was an incredible treat - the most wonderful combination of apple pie and caramel apples!! Talk about a brilliant fall dessert! I shared this with several people, my neighbors included, and the consensus was that it would have been PERFECT over vanilla ice cream (we didn't have any), especially fresh out of the oven, in the same way that apple pie and vanilla ice cream go together, only better because this has the caramel sauce built right in. Per other comments, I also put the caramel on the apples rather than on the crumb topping, and this left the topping nice and crispy, while the apples and caramel sauce created a GREAT sauce that, again, would have really lent this dessert well to being served next to a scoop of ice cream. Also per a few comments, I went ahead and sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, then lined it with foil. Cleanup was super easy - two seconds in teh sink and the pan was clean because nothing stuck at all. I dread thinking about what it would have been like trying to clean up dried-on, hardened caramel sauce!! One last thought - I made the mistake of making this on a weeknight, and it was honestly too much work - I'm going to save this for family get-togethers or holidays or something like that. Thanks so much for posting this dessert!

sooooooo good! i made this for desert for an early thanksgiving tonight, and it was great! my apples gave off a lot of liquid, so it was a little soupy under the topping, but still tasted amazing. i doubled the topping mixture because i love tons of crumb topping. i used about 10 apples (they were small) and baked in a 9x13 glass pan. everyone really enjoyed it! will be making it again!

I also followed others advice and added nutmeg and cinnamon and poured the caramel (from a tub) over the apples before adding the topping.  The tip about putting it under the broiler for a few minutes afterwards worked like a charm.  It was a hit!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I didn't read the reviews first, so I put the caramel on top like the recipe dictates.  The "crisp" wasn't really very crispy as a result.  The apples were very runny and there were way too many juices in the bottom of the dish.  This dish was also extremely sweet.  If I were to make it again, I would cut the sugar amounts in half.  I think this recipe has a lot of potential, but as it is it doesn't deserve a five-star rating.

very good taste. but the work makes it not worthwhile. first, there is waaaaaaaaaaay too much caramel. the crisp wasn't crispy either. use a glass pan, cleanup will be much easier.

I followed the directions exactly as given and was very disappointed in the results.  It was much too soupy & way too sweet.  Not at all what I had expected.  My nephew loved it, but everyone else agreed it was just too much.

I just pulled this from the Oven and Ohmygod this is WONDERFUL! I can't stand anything apple, but my husband LOVEs apple anything. I had to try a piece just because i made it, and WOW! Best recipe I've tried from here yet!! Thank you my husband will LOVE this!! Great idea guys!!
OH! I had one tweak, I had to make the apple filling twice because there was not enough sugar mixture to cover the apples to make them really pop with flavor. EVERYTHING else was great!!

It was a hit at my potluck!  Everyone said it was delicious!  I followed a few of the other tips, such as adding apple pie spice and putting the caramel on the apples, not the oats.  For the oats I used packages of apple and cinnamin oatmeal.  To help cut down on cleaning I used a throw away foil pan so I wouldn't have to scrub.  Perfect with vanilla ice cream!  Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

Recipe is great other then needing a larger pan (9x13) and putting the caramel sauce over the apples not the crumble. It was great :D

I did not give it 5stars because I made some changes and I did not like the crumble part very much.  I did not add water to the apples, doubled the lemon and added apple  pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  The crisp part was not crispy at all, I had to add chopped wanuts to give it some crunch.  I also followed a previous eaters advice and made my own caramel.  Overall, it was very good.

I thought it was good but it was so sweet that the sweetness overpowered the taste of the apples. The crisp on the top was great - I think next time I will skip the caramel stuff and just make it as a traditional apple crisp.

The caramel just wasn't working for me, but the rest of this recipe was amazing. It really was the best ever.

Just incredible - so good!  Made this exactly as directed for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was LOVED by everyone.  The only one small change - assemble in a 9x13 pan, not 8x8!  My boys helped me by unwrapping all of the caramels -  I'm sure ready to use caramel would save some time :)

This is the best apple crisp I have ever had in my life.  I used the squeeze bottle caramel sauce, because that's what I had on hand, and it came out AMAZING.  I don't think I'll ever bother with another apple crisp recipe -- this is my go to recipe now!

Turned out delicious. I added some chopped walnuts to the topping to add an extra crunch. I used a jar of ice cream caramel topping (about half of a small one) and drizzled caramel on top of the apples and a little more on the topping before baking.  Very very sweet dish...ice cream is a must. Serve when hot!

I made a lower fat and sugar version of this and it was delicious.  I used 2 Tbsp sugar in the apple mix and 1/2 Cup brown sugar and butter in the crumble. I used 1/4 cup skim milk in place of the evaporated milk.   I served the caramel sauce and whipped cream on the side for those that wanted it.

We went looking for an apple dessert that added caramel to the recipe.  When I saw the name of this dish, I had to give it a try.....and it delivered! It truly is the "best ever".  Enjoy!

YUMMY!!! I cut the white sugar in half (1/4c.) and doubled the cinnamon (1tsp). I also used "hot caramel" icecream topping (the kind that's ok to heat) and poured it into sliced apples before adding crumble topping. Very rich and sweet! I sprayed my pan with PAM before filling and had no problems with clean-up!

this definitely was the best ever!! It was almost too good! not good for my waistline! I couldn't stop eating it. I ate mine with vanilla ice cream and used some of the left over caramel over it.. omg it was the best thing I've ever made! I sprayed the caserole dish with cooking spray before baking. it makes it easier to clean up.

I made this the other day for my husband's birthday. It was a hit! There was none left!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did take others advice & doubled the crisp topping because that's our favorite part. It was perfect. I'll use this recipe from now on.

I agree that this is absolutely the best ever apple crisp. I used Cortland apples and it turned out perfectly. Granny Smiths also work quite well. Thanks for sharing this one! It was a real hit with my family!

This was the best I have ever had.  My husband told me not to make any other kind from now on.  I did change things though after reading other reviews.  I used apple pie spice a 9x13 glass pan and carmel sauce from a jar.  I put the carmel sauce on before the topping and also on top of the topping.  I had no problem with sticking, like others said.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it for the first time and took it to a church function.  Needless to say, there wasn't much for me to take home!  It was a big hit.  I will absolutley be making this again!

I made this with a conversion to 8 servings.  It fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan.  I put a little extra lemon juice to counteract the sweetness of the caramel.  Also with the apples I put 1-2 tablespoons of extra flour so it wouldn't turn out to be soupy.  I also put half of the caramel on the apples and then put most of the crumble on.  Then I put the remainder of the caramel on top of that.  Then put the remainder of the crumble on top about 1/2 cup.  It came out perfectly!!!!!!  My boyfriend loved it!!!!!

This was excellent.  I used a 9x13 pan, and store-bought caramel.  Next time,  I think I will add raisins or something for contrast.  Great recipe, I will make it again.

This was AMAZING! I followed suggestions of other reviewers and made in a 9 x 13 pan. I also put the caramel sauce on top of the apples with the crumble over it.  Came out great.  I will probably add another apple when I make it again.

I love this version! It's adaptable to larger and smaller servings as needed, and you really can't go wrong if you add more caramel or apples as you like. I use medium-sized Granny Smith apples, use a premade caramel sauce, and pour the sauce both over the apple mixture and the topping. Didn't think anything could replace my family's peach cobbler for best fruit dessert recipe ... but this does!

I have made this recipe about 20 times and it has never failed me. I've made it in both a 9x9 and 9x13 pan and both were fine. In a 9x9, I must admit that it looks really fully but once the apples start to cook, they soften and the entire crisp shrinks down quite a bit...so don't be afraid to use a 9x9! I omit the caramel sauce only because I never had caramels in the house. Perfect with vanilla ice cream and very, very easy!

This was amazing!  The only tweak I made was using the caramel that is used for dipping apples, which made this super easy. I put that on top of the apple mixture prior to placing the crumble topping on, which others suggested as well.  This was a huge it and perfect with vanilla ice cream on top!

This is so good!!!  I used to buy this caramel apple pie locally which I loved, but they stopped making it.  I found this recipe and it's better than the pie I loved orginally.  It really is the Best Ever Caramel Apple Crisp!!

I was surprised how easy this was to make. I've never made anything like this before and it was delicous. I gave it 4 stars because I felt like something was missing. will make it again but using some of the suggestions in the other reviews. Also, you definitely need a large baking dish for this. Don't use the size recommended in the recipe.

I really believe this deserves the full 5 star rating.  Made this to take to my husband's boss' for dinner!  What a hit!! I made it according to the directions but also put the caramel on before the crumble.  I think it helped bake the apples better.   Serve with vanilla bean icecream.   Followed the recipe as written.  It really helps to have an apple/corer/slicer which I purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond.  Pampered Chef sells one too.  A must have to make Apple Crisp!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I halved the recipe and it fit into a 8x8 glass pan. After reading other reviews, I did spray the pan with Pam and add the caramel (I used caramel dip) over the apples. I will definitely be making this again, however, I think I will try adding a little apple pie spice and chopped pecans.

This was good but I don't think it was worth all the extra calories. I will stick with the traditional apple crisp.

This turned out fabulous with the same variations as everyone else has stated. I only had 3 apples so I cut the recipe in half and that fit in a 9x13. I had some homemade caramel that was a little softer than we prefer so I used it. I just eyed about how much I would need, warmed it up and poured it over before the crumble. AMAZING!!!

Four stars because it tastes good but I would make a few revisions next time. It was a little too mushy for me, the topping didn't have enough crunch and there was way too much caramel to drizzle on top of only an 8X8 pan of this. I had to save a good amount of it (not a problem since it would be great on ice-cream or for dipping apple slices). Next time I will try putting some of the caramel into the apple mixture, add walnuts, add more flour and lemon juice to the filling as other reviewers suggested and probably find another struesal recipe to top it with to see if its any better.  Aside from the mushy gooey texture, it tasted pretty good though. Very sweet.

My husband...my husband...who doesn't like dessert in general, who first turned his nose up at this and said. "Oh, uhhh...I'll try it a little later."  Uh huh, sure...I thought.  Well, he finally he brought some over to the couch, with a little vanilla ice cream on it, and slowly began to eat.  He didn't say a word til he was finished, so I thought at best I would get an.  "It was ok."  But low and behold.  He looked down at it and said.  "Sally!  This is really, REALLY good!"  I nearly fell over.  So there ya go.  The only thing I changed is that I added 1 tbs of melted butter to the apples, and used caramel sheets (the kind you wrap apples in, they worked great).  Happy Baking!

This is awesome stuff!!  I doubled the flour, lemon juice and cinnamon.  Then I drizzled caramel ice cream syrup over the apples, put the topping on and drizzled more caramel over that instead of making the sauce listed in the recipe.  This HAS to be served with vanilla ice cream!

Oh, I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this.  I tried to put this into an 8x8 dish and made the biggest mess.  Then I tried to dump it into a 9x13 and the topping was on the bottom.  This made it soggy and stick to the bottom.

This was really good. I put it in a 9 X 13 pan, but i would next time cut the carmel part in half, and cut the topping down by a 1/4.  Together it's a little to much, and you can't appreciate the apple. But over all it is a keeper

I tried this for my family and friends and they all loved it. I followed others suggestions with the extra spices and vanilla pudding. My husband is boderline diabetic and it seems all my friends are always on a diet I used splenda for all my sugars, sugar free - fat free pudding, light butter and sugar free caramel ice cream topping. Everyone raved and my teen agers didn't even notice that it wasn't loaded with "diet" ingredients.

This was a little too sweet for me but got rave reviews from everyone else.  It would be great with vanilla ice cream to cut down the sweetness of the caramel a little bit.

This has to be one of the best dishes I have ever made.  I had to make a second batch just to see what it tasted like.  The first batch I made was too hot to eat when I left for work, I came home from working the graveyard shift thinking I would have some for breakfast.  My family ate the entire pan without saving me a bite!!! I didn't tweak the recipe at all, and found it just fine the way it is, but I am sure I will keep the other reviewers tips in mind when I make it again.  I will also be sure to make a pan just for myself!!!

I made this the way other reviewers recommended (caramel between apples and crumble topping, 9x13 pan, etc.). It was very delicious, but very very goopy. The topping, instead of being crisp, was really soggy. Next time I think I would reduce the butter in the crumble, and reduce the overall amount of crumble and of caramel. I think that would help the crisp topping to actually be crisp. Also, I would use caramel ice cream topping; it was an awful lot of work unwrapping and melting all those individual caramels.

Really delicious!  My daughter enjoyed helping to make and eat this.  The caramel adds something really special and the crispy topping was great.  We followed suggestions of other  reviewers and added the caramel and milk before the topping. Some caramel still bubbled up into the crisp and was great!

My family loved this recipe, but I do not recommend the 8X8 pan. The recipe is too large for that size. I would step it up to a 9X13. My oven was a gooey mess, though the crisp was great!

This was awsome!  I did use a larger pan as suggested.  I also used the caramel dip and drizzled that on top of the apples instead of on top of the crumble and it turned out perfect!  Will definitely make this again!

It was the easiest recipe. I have been searching for the recipe that my grandmother always made. This is the close to what she made. The best part was the carmel. I sub. sugar for Splenda and Splenda (brown sugar blend), 2 (3 oz.) bags of sugar free candy, 1/2 can of evaporated milk. 15mins left in the cooking of the crisp I drizzal the melted carmel candy mixed with evapoated milk. I put it in a 9 x 13 cake pan. Everyone loves it. It is also something that my dad can have. He is Diabetic. I serve it warm toped with vanilla ice cream. MMMMMM.

Best apple crisp ever!! I made it for a big group at our cottage and it was gone very fast! Notes: I used a 9x13 in baking dish. Also I omitted evap.milk&caramels and just drizzled with a bottled caramel sauce I had on hand. Delish!

Made this dish tonight and it turned out wonderful! I used chopped frozen apples that I had in the freezer so I omitted the water from the recipe. And it was a good thing I didn't add the water because I accidentally added the whole can of evaporated milk (instead of the 5oz it called for!) but it still turned out perfect! Other than that mistake, I followed the recipe to the letter and everyone loved it! It was served warm with ice cream.

The taste is AMAZINGGGGG...but...it definitely WILL NOT fit into an 8x8 pan...it truly isn't possible. It needs to go into a larger dish. I used the whole can of evaporated milk with the 14oz package of indiviually wrapped caramel squares-that was perfect. The only of the thing I changes was that I had to take a knife and poke lots of holes so that the caramel could go down into the dish. All of it sitting on top didn't seem appealing to me. 
Overall, this is a FABULOUS dish and truly tastes decadent!

My kids and I thought this was great , we didn't have any carmel and it still was delicious. We used Gala apples, thats what we had in the house and cut it into small pieces and put it over vanilla frozen yogart. Easy and great!!!

I made this last weekend for my family, everyone thought it was great. The only thing I did different was, I used carmel topping(jar), cuz I had it already, heated it up and drizzled it over. Thank you for sharing this recipe, will make again.

My kids and their friends and the people at work all love this.  The kids can't get enough.  I left my son and a friend of his alone with some that I had cooked earlier that day and when I got back a half hour later, they had eaten the whole thing.  BTW, I used the "Caramels" recipe on this site for the caramel.  It makes quite a bit, but it's really good.

I won't make this one again, too sweet for my taste. I can see why some would like it but feel there are better recipes. The caramel in this one did not add that much and like another review said, not worth the extra calories. Also too gooey.

Given the amount of ingredients, I knew an 8x8-in pan would be too small.  I used a glass 9x13-in pan so had no problem with cleanup.  Using 10 small Granny Smith apples was insufficient, although the pan was quite full with bubbly goo.  The crumble wasn't crumbly at all--more goo.  All-in-all, I was surprised it wasn't as sweet as I expected.  However, for the amount of ingredients, the steps involved, the gooey texture, and moderate taste, this recipe will be filed in the "Never make it again!" folder.

OMG! This is unbelievable! I THINK you should go for the 8X8 pan! and not 9X13,  this is made to be thick and juicy!  the topping is unbelievable!  and what i did, i had a jar of smuckers caramel, nuked it for 45-50 mins,  pour some over the apples and the topping, you dont need much,  this is a very filling desert!   p.S  my husband doesnt like apple crisp (cinnamon thing!) He loved this dessert!  and i served it with a big dollop of cool whip!  mmmmmm

This recipe was really good; lots of compliments.  I am going to cut back on the crumb portion of the recipe.  It made a nice crust, but I had too much left over.  The caramel really set it off well.

This recipe is awesome!  I made a few changes and only used a half a cup of butter instead of the full cup.  You cannot taste the difference and it makes it healthier.  I also did not use the evaporated milk with the caramel.  I used approximately 1/4 cup of skim milk to thin the caramel down.  It worked perfectly.  This is my favorite apple crisp recipe.  I make it all the time for my family.  We love it!

Excellent recipe! I made a few changes and made it dairy-free by subbing soy magarine for the butter and soy milk for the evaporated. These changes didn't affect the taste. WOW.

I took this recipe and incorporated all of nicademusx suggestions below (ziploc bag, cooking cream instead of water, vanilla pudding mix instead of flour in the cumble and the HOMEMADE CARAMEL instead of the melted caramel squares) and this apple crisp is the best I've ever had and my family LOVED it too!  I took it to a family dinner, there wasn't a crumb left and the kids who don't like apple crisp had the left-over caramel on vanilla ice cream and they couldn't get enough (frankly, I have never had such an amazing caramel sauce myself either - YUMMY)!!!

This was a HIT!! I made a couple adjustments. I used a tub of caramel sauce and put it right on the apples. I added SKOR TOFFEE BITS (available in your chocolate chip aisle) to the crumble and sprinkled some more on top about 5 minutes before it was done baking. I definitely lined the pan with aluminum foil and that made a big difference in clean up. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING with vanilla bean ice cream. 

For an EXTRA special treat (like this isn't enough already!) in the morning you can use the left-overs to make a delicious oatmeal breakfast (great on a cold fall or winter day!). Just add the rest to your favorite porridge recipe. YUM!

Oh my goodness, this is soooooooo good!  I used the vanilla pudding suggested by one of the reviews.  I took it to a picnic and everyone raved over it!  I used about 3/4 jar of the caramel topping over the apples and only used 1/2 the crumble mixture.  It is really rich, I will cut the sugar in the apples next time.  Use the vanilla pudding instead of flour, it's great!

I followed another reviewer advice, and added extra, lemon juice, and apple pie spices, alittle more white sugar, I omitted the water, and replaced with vanilla extract, and brandy adding to 1/4 cup. added the carmel topping, Mrs. Richardson butterscotch carmel topping, then last oatmeal topping. baked at 350' for about 45 min. the bomb!!! Family loved it!

the BEST crisp!  I've had nothing but rave reviews the last two times I've made this (both times for early Thanksgiving dinners with church and friends) and we are making it for today's family Thanksgiving feast.

I have been waiting to make this one for a while.  I finally got around to it tonight and WOW!  It is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten!  I only did a couple of things different.  I used 6 medium Winesap apples because that is what I had on hand and I also added 1/4 tsp. ground cloves to give more of an apple pie taste.  This is a great recipe and definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Very good - my family loved it. I used the larger pan like several people suggested. I found it a little too sweet, next time use a little less sugar or less caramel. But all-in-all, everyone loved it.

This was sooo good. after reading some other reviews, i did layer in the caramel before the crumb topping and I did spray the pan with pam first. I also used a bigger pan. I'll definitly make this again :)

This was so delicious!  It was gobbled right up at our family party.  I think I did something wrong with the caramel though because it didn't drizzle, it just made one big caramel layer.

This recipe couldn't be easier, and it tastes delicious!  It makes a lot of topping, which is my favorite part.  Definitely use a 9x13 size pan, it makes a lot.  Thanks!

Made this dessert following other comments and came out great. Used a pre-baked pie crust as a base and just piled filling into that instead of dealing with a large mess. Used a double-boiler to melt caramel so all in all clean up was a snap. Very sweet recipe that went great with vanilla ice cream!

Very good apple crisp recipe.
Next time I will apply the caramel after it is baked or on top of the apples as others have suggested.  The caramel on top while baking does not allow the oat topping to get truly crisp.

Since the "crunchy top" didn't turn out very crunchy because of the caramel on top, I would recommend to put the caramel on top of the apples and then put the crumble on top.  You'll still get the caramel, but you'll also get a crunchy top.

This recipe was amazing.  I would prob. use less caramel next time, so that the top is not completely covered by caramel, so that that there will be some crisp in the apple crisp.

I added walnuts, cardamon,vanilla & almond extract to the filling. I also altered the recipe as suggested by pouring the carmel sauce over the apple filling rather than on the strussle.  It was very decadent! I will be making again.

Delicious but too sweet.  I put no sugar at all on the apples and only half of the sauce into the pan.  The rest I kept for pouring over the ice cream that we served with the apple crisp!

Great lower sugar version of the standard.  I agree with other ratings - needs more cinnamon, and definitely should put the caramel on before the crumble (otherwise the carmel gets too brown and the crumble is not brown enough :( ). The next time I make it I'll definitely make the adjustments.  Will probably also move to a 9x12 pan vs. the 8x8, which I felt was overcrowded and with the crumble was just piled too high for my liking!

This was gone before I had the chance to eat any....but according to the rest of the party, they said it was the best apple crisp ever!
I went by what others were saying and lined the pan with foil and then sprayed it with PAM.  Also before putting the crumb top on, I drizzled the caramel and added maple syrup over the apple mixture, gave it just enough of a hint of maple.
Now I have to make it for a retirement party.  Good thing it's super easy to do.

This is always my go to recipe for apple crisp.  I too add more cinnamon, more apples and use a 9x13 baking dish but other than that, no changes to the recipe.  I also make this in a gluten free version by putting GF oats in a blender and substitute that for the flour.

The tweaks I made: put the caramel sauce UNDER the topping, skip the lemon juice (I didn't have any), and I used a box of vanilla pudding in place of 1/2 cup of the flour in the topping. Oh and I sprinkled a bit of nutmeg on top because it goes so well with apple. I saw a lot of people say they used caramel apple dip or ice cream topping from the store in place of the recipe's sauce, I didn't have that so I grabbed some soft caramels from the dollar store and melted them in some milk in the microwave.

I used margarine instead of butter and cut both sugars in half and it was still delicious.  Agree with the others about using a larger pan (greased) and pouring the caramel sauce directly on the apples.  Thank you for these suggestions!

I used salted butter and Hershey's caramel instead of the original recipe's requirements. I made this in a dutch oven using charcoal for heat two different times for scouting events. The first was an Eagle Scout presentation that the adults competed for best desert.  I easily won running out of my recipe quickly while others had more than half their creations remaining.

This was very good, and quick to make.  I was making it for my parents for Christmas and they aren't too into sweets.  That being said, I omitted the caramel because I felt that would have been too sweet for our tastes, and without it, the crisp still was a big hit

To die for!  Did as others suggested by putting caramel directly on the apples, and then adding the crumble.  I used the sundae topping and it tasted great.  Added more to the ice cream that was served with it.  Will definitely make this again.

This made WAY too much for an 8x8 pan but I had to cram it in as my other pans were in use. Next time, I will cook the apples separately and drain off the juice- it was super sloppy. Great taste and texture otherwise

This is delicious. I took the recommendation of others and drizzled the caramel on top of the apples.  Because of the number I was feeding, I doubled the amount of apple filling but left the amount of topping the same.  It was perfect and a huge hit.  I will definitely make it again.

Doubled cinnamon and lemon juice. First time ever making apple crisp and it was absolutely fantastic! Will be saving and reusing this recipe for sure.

Way too sweet will make again but 1/2 or 1/4 the amount of Carmel also definatly going to spray with no stick spray also will add something to thicken G juices in bottom . I also added cinnamon because my family likes it

In the past I tried a shortcut using a caramel ice cream topping, but using caramel pieces as the recipe states is the best.  I added raisins and walnuts.  I had to bake it about 5 minutes longer for a nice crust, but if you like it "not quite done"' 45 minutes will be perfect! This is the best caramel apple crisp recipe yet!

I followed the directions and the dessert turned out just fine.  Next time I make it I will pour the caramel sauce over the apples as suggested by a reviewer and then spoon the crumble over the apples.

So delicious! Made as written with the exception of caramel under the crumbs and adding some nutmeg.  Not sure why everyone had problems but this cleaned up fine and I only used an 8x8 pan.  I have made this many times and it is my fave apple crisp recipe!

I agree with using a 9" x13' pan.  This would overflow an 8" x8" pan.  I used Golden Prime apples, as I had a bunch and it turned out just fine.

The apple crisp was good for flavor and easy enough to make. I did not make the caramel sauce though. If you are looking for an east, tasty apple crisp, this is your recipe to try :)

I used granola instead of the oats, cut down on sugar but still thought it was too sweet. I'll only add a 1/4 cup brown sugar in the filling next time and cut down on the sugar in the crumble. But this was very delicious!

This is thee best recipe for apple crisp.  I did make some changes to it.  Instead of drizzling the caramel on top of the topping, I mix it in with the apples.  I also double the recipe for topping.  Very excellent!!

Wanted to amp up the healthier side of this dish.  End result was 5 star.  I made substitutions. Probably not a healthier solution, but I had a Sander's caramel sauce on hand (so good).  Just heated it and added to apple mixture before the crumble.  Really, really good stuff.  Will try next time w/coconut milk whipped cream.

I agree that it must go in a 9X13 pan.  It is a great dessert, but I just wish it didn't take so long to make.

Great dessert. I made a couple changes, 1st, after baking I spread butter and marzetti carmel dip on top and broiled till crunchy and then realized I had no whip cream. I made some instant french vanilla pudding YUM that put it right over the top. Will definately make again.

Delish! Took previous reviewers advice and used caramel dipping sauce to cut down on prep time and used tart and sweet apples for variety. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A great dessert on a cold night!

I finally found my favorite Apple Crisp recipe - YUMMO! I didnt have caramels for the top so I just poured on some ice cream caramel topping that I had. I made it for only me and my husband so I cut it in half and just put it in a little bread pan. Delicious!

I changed a lot of items in this recipe, so I don't know how fair of a rating this really is. First, I had previously frozen pie filling from the summer that I used and I did just use a jar of the caramel topping. I followed others' advice and added the caramel first and then the crumble topping (which is fantastic). I was able to fit this in the dish called for although others recommended a larger one. My husband and I really loved this dish and still ate the leftovers even though the topping had gotten quite soggy.

I have to make this every time my sister-in-law comes to town because she loves it so much (as does the rest of the family).  I save time by using the caramel bits in a package so you don't have to unwrap each caramel individually.

This recipe is great!!  Everyone I have ever made it for absolutely loves it.  After a few times making it as a crumble I decided to try using it for pies.  If you like apple crumble pies you will love this recipe as pies.  The only thing I do differently is to make sure that the apples are really pretty dry so that I don't end up with a soggy crust.

If you are making it as a cobbler make sure that you use a 9x13 dish.  I also put the caramel on before the crumble top, and season to taste.

AWESOME! I do not usually like apple crip but this was wonderful. I sent some to work with my husband and everyone there loved it. Just a note; I did have to use a 9x13 pan to bake it in. I also poured 1/3 of the carmel sauce over the apples, then put 1/2 of the topping on then 1/3 of the carmel sauce, then the rest of the topping and the last 1/3 of the carmel sauce on top. I was concerned that the topping may turn out soggy on top if I poured all of the carmel sauce on top. It turned out perfect. My second batch is in the oven right now. Enjoy!!

This recipe was great, with the suggestions from other reviews: I used a 9x13 pan, already-prepared caramel sauce, and poured it on top of the apples. Yum!

This is a great recipe. I took it to a church potluck, and got a lot of compliments. I added a lot more cinnamon (like 1T to the apples, and 1T to the topping).  I also switched the amounts of flour and oats, because I prefer oats. I used caramel ice cream topping (the kind that has milk in it) and it worked great. YUM!

I loved this recipe, but you can make it absolutely perfect in a springform pan, don't ask me how. It just helped it a bit. I plan on making this again and again. Please submit more of your wonderful recipes.

This is a very delicious recipe. My family loved it! I didn't have to make any alterations at all. It was perfect just the way it was. My only suggestion is to try it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Simply scrumptious!!

Overall very tasty recipe, but very watery. Definitely need a bigger pan than 8x8...will make it again, but will cut way down on the water, and mabye cut the crumb topping down by a third as well.

Very good balance of tartness, sweetness, and crunch! I bake in individual ramekins and serve.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year instead of the traditional pumpkin pie.  It was a hit, even though I forgot to add the caramel topping!! I wanted to shortcut it so I bought sundae caramel topping, which was forgotten in the refrigerator but the next time I make it I will follow the directions and make the caramel topping. Also paired it with ice cream- plain vanilla will do!  YUMMO.

Easy to do and tastes great.  I use pre-made caramel sauce on top to save time.

Delicious, but very watery.  I would add tapioca or corn starch to thicken it up the next time.  And, per other reviews, I added some cinnamon to the crumb topping, and it had a very nice flavor.

Was good but too much caramel which made it too "soggy". Next time I will do the caramels over the apples and not the crumble. I wished I would have read the other reviews before baking this.

The filling was very good in this apple crisp. Because I had a jar of premade caramel sauce on hand, I used that instead.  The topping however, I did not care for as much.  Next time I would use the topping from Apple Crisp II from this site.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  My husband even ventured to say that it just about beat his grandma's famous apple pie (an incredible feat, I must say).  If you want a perfect fall treat, this is it!  I used about 1/3  less butter in the topping than it called for, and served it with vanilla icecream.  I gave the recipe to some of my family, and they agree with me - amazing!

very good recipe- I used caramel dip and put it on the apples as was suggested in other reviews - I doubled the apple mixture for a 9x13 pan after I saw that one recipe just didn't fill the pan - added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to one batch of apple mixture - added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the crumbly topping for some added flavor - My family thought it was very tasty.

this crisp was amazing!  i've gotten compliments on it from everyone who's eaten it.  i would say that i used the suggestion to use a larger pan..but i probably could have fit it in a smaller pan (guess i used smaller apples).  Also, i accidently added a cup of sugar to the "crisp", and it came out with more of a crust, but was still yummy.

Great dessert.  I stole a few of ideas from other reviews, and I must admit, they were all correct:  use a 9x13 foil lined pan and put the caramel on the apples and top with the crumble.  I also used the caramel fruit dip and it worked great - it spreads easily and no messy pots to clean.

Although this was good, it was not better than my regular recipe that does not use caramel and it was also much more work.  I am glad I tried it, but it's back to old recipe for me.
