I've made this twice now, and it really does help to layer the hashbrowns on the bottom of your pan, bake them first until they start to brown (I turn the oven way up to 450 and dot butter on top), and then add the rest of your ingredients (and bake at 350).  After doing this, I found that the total baking time was shorter than the recipe stated.  The texture was much better too.

YUMMY!!!  I followed the other suggestions and put the hash browns in first instead of mixing it.  I added a couple of shakes of salt and pepper on top of the hash browns and I baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes before pouring the egg mixture over the top. I didn't put quite the amount of milk this recipe called for.  I only put 1 cup in, if that.  2 cups just sounded too much, and would be very runny. I also added a few shakes of salt and pepper to the egg mixture because of some comments that the dish was a little bland.  This was smelled great while cooking and tasted just as wonderful!  Delicious!!  Thank you Stephanie!  This is definatley a keeper!

I modified this for a large crowd at work. I used 12 eggs, 1 1/2 cups skim milk, 1 cup lite sour cream, bacon and diced ham.  I combined cheeses, including reduced fat cheddar, for a more healthy, lower-fat meal. I followed another reviewer's advice and put the hash browns in first and I think that worked well. I made it up the night before and cooked it in the morning.  Word of advice -- allow a significantly longer cooking time when refrigerated.  I needed to increase oven temp. to 375 degrees and needed another full hour in the second part of the cycle, for a total of 1 hour 45 minutes. It was still hot when I arrived at work and was gone in minutes. Certainly the best breakfast casserole I've ever tasted and if the reviews from work were accurate, a sure crowd-pleaser.  I supplied the recipe to a number of co-workers as they loved it too!

Just delicious, and a real keeper! So many egg casseroles contain flour, and I needed a great recipe for my gluten-intolerant friend. This was perfect! I baked the hashbrowns in the greased casserole for about 30 minutes at 425. Meanwhile, I cooked the bacon nice and crisp. Over the potatoes, I layered the crumbled bacon, green pepper, onion, and cheese and poured the egg mixture over all. Then I refrigerated it overnight and baked it as directed in the morning. Some folks may be missing that there are two separate cooking times--45 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered. If you realize this ahead of time, it helps with planning.

This is sooo easy and good.  To make this even easier, I use the hashbrowns O'brien (which have chopped onions, red/green bell peppers already in it). The combination of ham and bacon is good or one can be subbed for the other.  In the future, I'll also play around with the different types of cheese out there.  Pepperjack for kick perhaps? Either way, very good and fool-proof!

Great recipe.  I made it for a Christmas Brunch, and it was a hit.  I pre-cooked my hash browns and bacon (but not too cripy), placed the hash browns on the bottom of the casserole dish, layered bacon on top.  I also sauted my bell pepper and onions in butter before adding them to the eggs and cheese.  I followed the advice of others and added more eggs and also seasoned them.  Will make again.

If you make the recipe as stated, its a disaster. You must read the reviews and follow thier advice. I didn't have time to read them so it was basically a waist of time and money. Both the bacon and hashbrowns should be pre-cooked. I figured that out myself with the bacon and did so but did not pre-cook the hashbrowns and they tasted raw in the casserole. I also thought it would have been very bland if I had not added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt and dry mustard. Also needed to be baked in a 11 x 13 pan. This recipe is only worth trying if you follow other's advice and pre-cook bacon and hash browns.

I really liked the idea of having all of my favorite breakfast items in one dish. It was very quick and easy to assemble. I think it would have been better if the hash browns were browned and seasoned before putting into the casserole. I think putting them in right out of the bag made it bland and kind of starchy tasting. Overall I liked this recipe, but think that I'll brown the potatoes and add more seasoning next time.

This is outstanding and so easy.  I love that you don't have to let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I omitted the green peppers and added sauteed mushrooms, since that's what I had on hand.  I also pre-baked the hashbrowns with a little butter.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of milk and 10 eggs because it just looked like it needed that, maybe because I added lots of mushrooms and onions.  I also used Velveeta for some of the cheese, since I didn't have enough shredded Cheddar.  It turned out great!  I took about half of the casserole and rolled it into flour tortillas and froze them for quick breakfasts later in the week.  They heat up super quick (30 seconds) in the microwave and assure that none of this casserole will go to waste.  Great recipe!

I decided to change this up based on what I had and to simplify the preparation. If it turned out poorly, I would not have rated it at all, but it was fabulous! I decided to use Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien because they already have the onion and green pepper and we like them. I did as others suggested and pre-baked them for about 15 minutes-next time I'll do 20 minutes. I also used the entire 28 oz. bag. Before pre-baking, I generously sprinkled with salt and pepper. To adjust for using more potatoes, I used 13 eggs that I had on hand. Other than omitting the onion and green pepper, I left the rest of the ingredients the same. The amount of milk was still perfect. Next time I will use more bacon (personal preference and skimpy bacon was used), and I will increase the shredded chese to 4 cups. The cooking time was almost dead-on. I removed the dish five minutes earlier than called for. These amounts are perfect for a 9x13 casserole dish. Excellent and easy to make! Thank you.

Really good and very easy.  I used potatoes o'brien so I wouldn't have to worry about chopping onions and green peppers.  I like to use sausage and I cook it beforehand.

I precooked my bacon (my fear is always that it won't be cooked all the way through...yuck).  I also shredded my own potato per the advice of another reviewer. This was delicious.  Cook time takes a long time...but worth the result.  Thanks for the post.

I made this this past Thursday morning for work - I did make a couple of changes in that I took everyone's suggestions - I used Orida's hash browns with peppers ad onions. I baked them while I was cooking Neese's hot sausage with onions and green peppers. While that was being done I took the dz eggs and 1 cup of milk, put it int he blender and put it on low and let it beat while the meat was cooking. Took the hash browns out of the oven and sprinkled a bit of salt and  did fresh ground pepper - the mix of white, black and I think red. Then put the sausage, onions, pepper and put them over the has browns then poured the well frothed egg/milk mix and poured it over that. I then took a Mexican blend cheese (I think it was cheddar and monterary jack) put it over the top, did a little more salt and pepper then covered, baked for 45 min and then took the cover off and finished it the other 30 min. It was a HUGE hit and I WILL be making it next for my hubby's office.

Super delicious, and thanks for the comments that gave me a guide on improvements.  I used O'Brian potatoes, which I pressed into a buttered 9 x 13 and pre baked for about 15 mins, I pre cooked the bacon til crisp and layered that over the potato 'crust', and then reduced the cheese to two cups of sharp cheddar and the milk to about a cup, and added eggs to a total of 10. I finely diced some extra onion into the liquids, but it really didnt need it using the O'Brian's, and I should have sauteed them a bit.  I LOVED this, thanks for the recipe.

This is such a wonderful basic breakfast casserole recipe. I made it at home and the family loved it.  So when it came time for Easter brunch at the LTC facility I work at, I volunteered to make more.  The first batch for 50 as written.  I made the second batch for 50 a little spicier using Mexican hashbrowns, a 3-cheese mix (cheddar, Monterey Jack, Queso Blanco), and substituted 2 large jars of salsa for the equivalent amount of milk.  My residents, familes and staff loved it.

I've been making this for years and it's much better if you brown the hashbrowns before layering in the bottom, gives it a much better flavor.  Also saute the vegetables before using as well.  Thanks for sharing.

There are 2 reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The first is that the recipe as written does not call for pre-cooking the bacon. You end up with limp bacon and a layer of grease on top of the casserole. I also think there is too much milk in the recipe. However, it is a great jumping point and with a few tweaks it has become a hit in our house! I always fix it Christmas morning but I make it a lot through the year also (even as a no fuxx dinner). Our favorite variation is to use sausage instead of bacon, mexican blend cheese, and add a well drained can of Rotel. Yummy! It's also good with spinach and mushrooms for a brunch.

This recipe was fabulous......I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and the suggestion of previous reviews.  I did put the potato on the bottom, season with onion salt and pepper then top with butter and cook for about 10 minutes.  I also used and entire dozen eggs and just over 1 cup of milk.....2 cups would have been way to much.  I used a pound of bob evans breakfast sausage which I cooked beforehand.  I also sauteed my onions in the skillet with the sausage and added some chopped portabello mushroom.  I didnt used green pepper because I was too lazy to chop them up and also used only 2 cups on cheese which was more than enough and I love cheese.  I also added onion salt and pepper to the egg mixture.  The cooking time was spot on and the dish was beautiful and flavorful.  This was my first attempt at making a breakfast casserole.  This one is a keeper.  I will experiment with other fillings in the future.  You can put any meats cheeses and veggies in it that you enjoy.  Thanks.

My hubbie had 4 servings! That said, I did make some changes.  I made a half sized serving in an 8x8 pan, but used the full pound of bacon.  My family are carnivores!  I used the O'Brien hash browns, pre-cooked to give more texture & made the bacon the night before to ease Xmas morning for me. I also used 1/4 tsp of Emeril's creole seasoning & 4 grinds of pepper on the hash browns & a dash more in the egg mix.  It was outstanding & my family was poking in the fridge asking where the leftovers were...  and there weren't any!  Hubbie asked me to make it again for New Years Day!  He said that I finally found the breakfast casserole to make everyone happy!

This is a go-to recipe for breakfast casserole.  I half the recipe for just my fiance and I and we get some leftovers.  I used ham instead of bacon, and bake the hashbrowns for about 10 minutes before adding the egg mixture.  Definitely needs a little salt and pepper to the mix.   I use the frozen diced peppers and onions which makes it much easier and turns out great too.

This casserole was a big hit at our Easter brunch.  Like other suggested, I lined the pan with the potatoes and baked them for about 15 minutes before adding the egg mixture.  I also used a combination of sausage and bacon and used sweet peppers and scallions.  Delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made some minor changes to enhance it...I added  O'Brien hashbrowns, about 2/3 of the bag instead of the entire bag.  I also used 2c. Kraft 4 cheese Mexican and reserved 1 cup of cheese to add to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking.    The O'Brien potatoes and mexican cheese give it a  little kick and great flavor.  I also seasoned the potatoes and put themin the oven for 20 minutes before adding the egg, bacon and cheese mixture.  It was great!
another tip...fry the bacon and put it on a baking sheet in the oven for 5-10 minutes to get it extra crisp!!

Slightly modified. (of course)  Cut bacon before cooking, put in one clove of garlic and omitted bell pepper, added a little extra cheese to the top and set to broil for final 10 minutes or so.  Found a little sour cream on top is the perfect touch.  I will be making this one again sometime.

Perfect breakfast casserole.  I browned the bacon and crumbled first before adding to the casserole.  The directions don't specify, but it turned out well this way.  I used Bob Evans Hash Browns that are kept in the refrigerated section of the grocery store, which also made this recipe quicker and easier rather than having soggier thawed hash brown potatoes.

This was exactly the taste I was looking for. I only used 7 eggs, 1 1/2 c of milk, precooked bacon, and 3/4 of a bag of the refridgerated "Simply Potatoes" hashbrowns. I also sauted the onions and green peppers along with mushrooms then added a diced tomato when mixing it all together for more of a vegetable dish. Turned out wonderful! My husband raved about it and the left overs were even great reheated. Since then I've also added fresh broccoli to the mix and it goes fantastic with it all, it adds more of a brunch taste to it.

I really liked this and my husband says this is his new favorite because of the bacon and potatoes.  I halved the recipe and it was just fine for my small family, but it did change the cooking time a bit.  I baked for about 40 minutes covered, then after about maybe 10 minutes uncovered I noticed that it was well set.  I turned the broiler on for just a minute to brown it up.  I didn't have issues with the texture of the unbrowned potatoes mixed throughout like the recipe calls for, but I can see how crisping it up might improve texture if you have the time and energy for the extra step.  I used red bell pepper instead of green and green onion because I had it handy, and I really liked the color combination.  I also added a shake of dry mustard since every other egg casserole recipe I have used calls for it (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp.?), and I put in a couple good grinds of pepper.  I didn't add salt because of the bacon, but I think next time I may add just a dash to the potatoes while they are thawing.  Good stuff, thanks!

I have been making this recipe for years now & have always had empty plates come back to the kitchen. However, my recipe doesn't call for milk. I use 1 dozen eggs, 3/4 bag cheese (remainder sprinkled on top), hash browns & what ever breakfast meat I happen to have on hand.
This can also be prepared in a crock pot. Spray crock with nonstick spray. 1st layer: 1/2 hash browns, 2nd layer: 1/2 breakfast meat, 3rd layer: 1/2 cheese. Repeat. Pour 1 dozen beaten eggs over all, cover & cook on low for 10-12 hours. Enjoy.

I got rave reviews for this one!  I made it for a ladies brunch and I went home with an empty dish.  I added red bell pepper and mushrooms, and used a combination of sausage and bacon.  I like this recipe because it is a solid base for throwing anything you like in and it will turn out great.  I will definately make it again.

I place the hash browns in the pan and brown before putting in the other ingredients. I like my potatoes to be a little crispy, that's all - personal preference. I also assemble it the night before and refrigerate so there is no prep in the morning. I find my casseroles don't really layer either, I think because my pan is bigger and everything spreads out, and things float up and down. Doesn't matter, it always turns out delicious!

This was a huge hit for our Teacher Appreciation breakfast.  Several wanted the recipe!
I browned my hash browns just a little prior to putting them in the dish.  I also used red bell pepper instead of green.  I used a 9X9 glass pan.
Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and baked this morning. It is wonderful. I did, however, listen to above reviews and use the frozen O'Brien hash brown potatoes. I fryed potatoes in a fry pan & drained first then continued with directions. I didn't trust they would be done enough for me. I also cooked the bacon fully in the oven first at 400 for about 20 mins for thick/center cut slices. I used 1/2 shredded pepper jack cheese 1/2 cheddar cheese. I used Mrs. Dash seasoning on top then baked as directed. Ymmmmm

Very Very good. Easy to assemble and make. I chopped up my bacon before frying in the pan. I find it makes it easier. It fries quicker and no need to crumble afterwards. But I seriously didn't change anything other then the minor detail of the bacon. As is, it's very decent. I found after tasting it. I really felt it needed some spices. Whether it was salt and pepper or some cayenne pepper. I think adding a tad little kick would make it outstanding. But as is...it's very good. The family liked it but one kid. But that was to be expected because he doesn't like eggy things. But if you love oven omelettes..you will like this very much.

I added more (30 oz) hashbrowns, (12) eggs, and used 1c milk, and 1 c sour cream.  I also browned the hashbrowns in the oven before pouring the mixture.  Next time I will use more cheese and more meat.  Overall pretty good.  It just takes a while from start to finish.

I made this for the first time and overall I liked it however, if I make it again I will cook the onions, greenpeppers and hasbrowns a bit before baking, some of the onions were crunchy.  I also think ground breakfast sausage would be better than bacon.  It doesn't tell you to add salt and pepper but I added some anyway. My husband ate 3 helpings!

GOOD casserole!  I did precook my bacon and my hashbrowns.  I think that was good advice from previous reviews!  I used 10 eggs and a little less milk.  Very tasty!

Our family is not particularly fond of green pepper, therefoe, we add a couple of green onions(scallions)to give it a little more pizzaz, otherwise we find the recipe very good.

This is a great base recipe.  I browned the hash brown potatoes in the oven first then added the egg mixture and baked until it was golden brown.   I did substitute sausage for bacon and mexican cheese blend for plain cheddar.  It was awesome!!

I've made this several times now - and I agree baking the hash browns for 10 minutes prior to adding the rest of the ingredients does give it a better texture. This is a very forgiving recipe - allowing you to decrease the cheese, substitute ham, or add other veggies. Thanks for sharing!

I use 1 1/2 lbs. sausage, which I cook with chopped red & green bell pepper & coarsley chopped onion. Drain off grease.  Then, brown hash browns in frying pan & season liberally with salt & pepper. Combine sausage/peppers & onions with hashbrowns, 8 lightly-beaten eggs, 1 cup milk, 2 cups of cheese.  Pour into 9" x 13" greased glass dish.  Top with a little more cheese & Bake at 375 for 30-40 minutes.  Very tasty. Serve with mixed fruit and thick slices of buttered Texas toast!  Yum!

Good. It is a bit bland; I think with some seasonings it would be wonderful.  I browned the potatoes first and halved the amount of milk.

Took advice of others and baked my shredded hash browns for 20 minutes before adding the egg mixture. Waited until the pan cooled before adding remaining ingredients. To cut the fat content, I used fat free butter spray rather than greasing the pan. Used 5 large eggs and 1 cup of egg beaters, 1 1/2 cups low fat (2% milk) cheddar, 1 1/4 cup 1% milk, and a 2.5 oz package of pre-cooked bacon pieces (great time-saver and no mess!). Chopped the onion and green pepper into tiny pieces and let it sit, covered, overnight in the 'fridge before baking.  Took about 35 minutes at 350. Turned out great.

This was just perfect for a family reunion brunch.  I did make a few adjustments having read others suggestions.  I used lean Jenny O Turkey ham cut into chuncks and 1/2 lb. of bacon.  To prep the night before, I popped the bacon in the oven on a cookie sheet for 20 min and sauteed and (heavily) seasoned the onions and potatoes.  In the morning, I spread the potato/onion mixture on the bottom of the pan, then the layer of ham and bacon (which I put in the oven on a tray while it was pre-heating to crisp it up again, then the egg/milk/cheese mixture.  Because I used more meat, I felt it needed more egg, so I ended up wisking 4 more eggs with maybe a half cup of milk and pouring it over the top.  Everyone loved it and no one noticed that it was turkey ham, lite shredded cheddar and fat free milk!!!!!!!!!!

This served great for an office breakfast cooked that morning.  I prepared the night before by pre-cooking hash browns with onions and peppers til slightly brown, and then mixing in chopped precooked bacon.  This made it easy to prepare to cook in the morning.  Came out delicious!

I have made a recipe similar to this for years. Mine requires to make it and refrigerate over night so that the eggs soak into the hashbrowns. It is fluffy and turns out everytime. So much easier than precooking the potatoes first especially if you are using it for a holiday meal. From refrig. to oven and done in an hour!

Made this this morning.  I followed the recipe except I baked the hash browns with some butter, salt, pepper green pepper and onion before adding the bacon, eggs and cheese.  I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the eggs before cooking.  I am from the south and was always taught you should season everything. This is a great recipe, I would have given it five stars had it not needed so many tweaks and it had stated that the Hash Browns should be cooked first which I think confused a lot of people and ruined a lot of peoples first attempts at this.

The recipe as written is very good and basic. However, it lacked any real kick. My family agreed it would've been better with sausage or maybe a stronger pepper or even an additional spice (dry mustard, etc). It was a solid recipe, just not outstanding.

This was very good. I made a few modifications: green onion instead of regular, I salt & peppered the hash browns and placed them in the dish, then prebaked 12 minutes. Next time I will go 20, since I would like them browned.  Also, an 11x7 pan is nowhere NEAR big enough for this, I used a 9x13 glass dish and it was perfect!  Next time I might cut down the shredded cheddar to 2 cups, it was a little too rich for me.  Make sure your bacon is super crispy when it goes in, the less crispy pieces were soggy/chewy.  Sausage would be very good in this, or finely chopped ham, as others have done.  You could also leave it out completely.  I will make this again!

We had this for Christmas.  Very hearty!  And great leftovers.  We decided it would also be good with ham or sausage, whatever your preference.

I doubled this recipe for a larger company breakfast funtion and it was a huge hit.  I browned the potatoes before adding them to the mixture and it just came out perfectly!!!

I've made this a couple of times & it's always a hit. I use the Jimmy Dean skillet's with meat & potatoes. I cook the contents of the package, season it with season-all for flavor & the put it all on the bottom of the casserole dish. My kids request this casserole for dinner too, not just breakfast. For the past 3 years this casserole has been a requested dish for christmas morning.

Delicious and easy!  I used 9 eggs, 2.5 cups of cheese, maybe a cup and a half of milk and potatoes o'brien with the onions in peppers already in them.  Sprayed a pan, hashbrowns in first, then egg and milk and cheese mixture on top...baked for 30 minutes. Perfect.  We had turkey bacon on the side, so I didn't add meat.  yum!

This was a really delicious breakfast casserole.  I used potatoes O''brien and baked them 20 min. before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Will definitely make this again for company or special occasion.

I, too, put the hashbrowns in the bottom of the pan, but first I sauteed the peppers and onions to soften them, then mixed them with the hashbrowns and some salt and pepper and some of the cheese. I found that the hashbrowns on the bottom were rather tasteless otherwise and if I didn't mix some cheese into the potatoes, it all floated to the top of the casserole as it baked. Otherwise, delicious recipe with relatively few ingredients!

I make a similar recipe but use O'Brien Hash Browns because they already have the onion and red and green peppers in them.  I also mix in Cream of chicken soup and sour cream and top with corn flakes mixed with melted butter.  You can also use sausage in place of bacon.  It's a terrific casserole for company.

This was a hit. I made it for a breakfast gathering and it went quick. My first attempt at a breakfast casserole was great. I recommend this to all. I did take the suggestions of layering the hashbrowns on the bottom.

This was very good.  I substituted sausage for bacon and used a 9x11" pan instead which worked fine.  Will make again.

I have made this recipe a couple of times. The second time I layered the hashbrowns on the bottom of the pan and cooked them at 350 for about 10 minutes.  I set them out to cool, and I put the onion and green pepper into a skillet and cooked them a bit to soften them up.  I mixed everything but the hashbrowns together, then poured the mixture over the hashbrowns and let it all sit overnight.  Simply marvelous!

Made this for a NASCAR tailgate party! It was a huge hit!  Prepared it the night before, baked it half way and then finished it in the a.m.   
I made a double batch - some with onions, green peppers and mushroons. The other with ham & onions. This will be a fav!!!

I just made this casserole for the first time and it came out very well. We only used 6 eggs and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. I pre-cooked the bacon and hashbrowns, then layered the hashbrowns on the bottom as many other reviewers suggested. I put mine in the fridge over night to make in the morning...and I agree that it took a longer time to cook (uncovered) than the 30 minutes it stated. It was more like an hour. I really like this recipe because you can adjust it in just about any way - add vegetables, add cheese, take out eggs, etc. I also followed a tip by another reviewer and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. It was really really good, would definitely make again!

Ok, well, as this recipe is written it didn't work for us. First of all, I think that the hashbrowns should just be on the bottom. Plus, there seemed to just be too many of them. Plus, I agree with other reviewers, it would have been better if they had been pre-cooked. I used pre-cooked bacon and that was good. The way it was written this took longer than 45 minutes to get the potatoes done, yet the other parts were definitely done. I am going to revamp this and do again. Thanks.

After reading reviews this is what I came up with. Precooked the hash browns and put in the casserole dish first. I used sausage and cooked the onion and bell peppers with. I used 12 eggs, 1 cup of milk and 1.5 cups of cheese. I also added spinach. Easily fed 10 adults.

This recipe was so good! I took the other reviewer's advice, and cooked the hashbrowns (with salt, pepper, and dots of butter on top) for about 35 minutes on 425 first, then I combinded all the other ingredients (I also used breakfast sausage, with the bacon, both cooked ahead of time), then did 45 mins covered at 350, and 20 mins uncovered at 350. Turned out great!

Brown the hash with butter, and put one layer in the bottom of the pan.  Mix the remaining hash with the mixture.  Flavor the mixture with black pepper and mucho garlic please.  Divide the milk by half.  I had to bake a little longer.  Thanks.

I increase the recipe as I'm never sure how many will join us at fellowship. I first made this for church fellowship on Easter. Everyone raved. Then last Sunday I made two versions. The original and one where I substituted bacon and pepper with spinach and sausage. I use whatever cheese I have on hand. Mainly cheddar but I had some pepper jack and swiss as well. Everybody came back for at least seconds.. even the kids who tend to be very finicky. This would be really good with some hot chilies but we have wuzzes in the crowd. Next batch I'll stir in some sour cream..Mexican style if I have it. Fresh corn would be nice too.

This was a hit at my house! We had breakfast for dinner for one night and now I am getting request to make it again. I did pre-cook the potatoes and bacon first which I think helped immensely. A little more work but worth the trouble.  I only added one cup of milk and 1 1/2 cup of cheese to the 8 eggs. I used the O’Brien potatoes since they already have the veggies in them. I added some onion powder, S&P, and garlic powder to the potatoes. I then put it all together & baked for 30 minutes covered and another 20 uncovered. It was the perfect consistency and turned out great. We served with English muffins and fresh fruit. I had lots left over and brought it to work and they had seconds and had me email them the recipe. Very good! I don't understand how anyone could mess this up. Very easy!

Yum.  This was a big hit for Easter brunch, layered the potatoes, crunchy bacon, eggs and onion with cheese.  The cheese stayed on top, but the eggs will puff up in the oven.  Added a fruit salad, bread, and brunch is done.

This was good, but it was't our favorite. I would add some spices and more onion and peppers, including red, it was bland.  Also the texture was mushy with the hash browns, maybe it was just the kind I used but I wanted more texture. Maybe more veggies and a cornflakes crust would help.

I made this for a crowd, and everyone LOVED it and wanted the recipe!  To make it even easier, I used the precooked bacon from Costco.  Simply microwave for 1 minute on a paper towel, and the bacon is ready!  I also made one of the casserole's with cooked, crumbled Italian sausage.  Excellent!!  Will make again and again!!

Very delicious and simple to make!  It was my first time making a breakfast casserole.  I followed the recipe exactly except used red bell pepper instead of green.  Great recipe!

Excellant... but 1 lb of bacon plus all the cheese = 1/4 of your daily intake in salt or more (not too good in the calculations dept). I prebaked the hashbrowns, then add by layering bacon (some jalapeno :) ), then cheese & egg/milk. Finished baking.  Watch carefully as cheese may start to overcook. Will lower oven temp. next time.  Sprinkled with some parsely at the end. Was tasty but a little salty for me.

This is one of my go to recipes for guests in our house. I too pre-cook slightly the hash browns, and sprinkle them with pepper. I use skim milk and substitute turkey bacon for regular bacon, and cut it up into one inch bites and pre-cook it slightly, then I layer everything and cover with the egg and milk mixture.....love love love this recipe!!!

Excellent recipe, turned out exactly right.  I will be making this for my Christmas morning breakfast.  I used some of the suggestions that others posted.  I browned the hashbrowns first at 450 degrees with butter on top.  Then reduced to 350 and cooked as directed.  I also added more cheese to the top.  It was perfect!

Yum! Very good - even without the bacon. After reading several reveiws, I decided to start my potatoes in a skillet so the onions and peppers could saute as well. Since I don't keep hashbrowns, I used a bag of tater tots and broke them down to bits with a firm spatula as they sauteed. The whole family liked this a lot!

Followed tips from others, used O'Brien hash browns, baked ahead for 30 mins. at 425. Layered crumbled bacon on top, then cheese, some salt & pepper, topped with egg mixture. Refrigerated and baked the following morning. Everyone liked this and wanted recipe.

I give this five stars.  It was excellent.  Everyone had seconds!
I did put the hashbrowns on bottom and baked them at 400 degrees until they started to brown around the edges as recommended by other reviewers. I will definitely make this again. thanks for a great recipe.

We liked this. I baked my hash browns first for a while to brown up a little, as others recommend. I forgot to add the bacon until it was done cooking. So I hurried and cooked it, chopped it up, then sprinkled it on the top. Would've been better mixed it though. Oops. Oh, and we aren't cheese lovers, so I didn't add as much cheese as called for. Tasty!

This is definitely one of the better breakfast casserole recipes I’ve tried. Instead of uncooked bacon, I used a 3 oz bag of real bacon bits. I sprinkled seasoning blend on the thawed hash browns and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes before topping with the egg mixture. I baked the casserole uncovered for 35 minutes. The top was perfectly browned but the inside was not quite set. So I covered the casserole with foil and cooked another 10 minutes. 

To get the hash browns crispier, I’ll try baking the hash browns for 10 minutes at 450 degrees next time as reviewer Christi suggested.

This recipe got rave reviews from my very picky family! I did a few things differently: I made my own hashbrowns from fresh potatoes, as well as I precooked my bacon before adding it in. I also used a full dozen of eggs and because i'm not a big fan of cheese i switched the cheddar to marble. I also omitted the green pepper because my family doesn't like them and added mushrooms instead. Because i precooked my bacon I didn't bother to cover with foil and baked only the 30 minutes until eggs were set. Will definitely make this again!!!

My mom made this a couple years ago for Mother's Day- and it was fantastic!  When I make it at home I leave out the peppers since my family doesn't like them.  I also alternate the bacon with a pound or so of diced up sausage links, which I brown with the onions first to give it all more flavor.  To feed more people, we add more eggs, milk and hash-browns. Yum!  We love this breakfast casserole since it it so light and easy to put together, especially the night before!

I added 1 c. parmesan, 1 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic salt, and 1 c. sour cream (in place of one of the cups of milk).  I thought it turned out much better, with more flavor... but it still lacks that "WOW" factor.

This is a great recipe! I doubled the recipe and put it into 2 13X9 casserole dishes and it turned out really well. I fed 21 people and every single one of them loved it! I substituted canned chopped green chilies instead of the bell pepper and I also left out the onion. This was a winner.

Very good...I used green chillies instead of green peppers.  Also added a bit of tobasco.  Used the layered technique as suggested and pre-cooked the bacon.

I have been using this recipe for the past two Christmas breakfasts and this will be our third.  This was such a hit the first time I made it, that I continued to every year since.  The only thing I due differently is I shread my own potatoes instead of using frozen.  Thanks for a great recipe Stephanie

I was unsure whether or not the bacon was to be raw or cooked, so I partially cooked it.  Next time I will use fully cooked bacon because it was a bit greasy.  It was still very good and the leftovers disappeared the next day.

This was so quick to prepare, about 10 minutes, and it received rave reviews.  As two family members don't eat meat, I just put bacon in one-half of the casserole dish and everyone got what they wanted.

Love this recipe! I decided to use the tip from Christi and baked the hash browns in the oven before adding the rest. I made a  double batch for my family and they all loved it! Both pans were gone in no time. Next time I am going to try sausage instead of bacon.

Two hours into this recipe, it occured to me that in just 20 minutes, I could have fried the hash browns, made perfect bacon in the oven, and cooked a western omelette.  While it tasted good, the time and effort aren't worth it.  You have to either wake up early, prepare the night prior, or have it for brunch.  I was the only one in my family to eat it, mostly because everyone else grew impatient and had cereal instead.

Based on other reviews I only used 1.5 c of milk and fried the hash browns for a little before mixing them in with the rest of the ingredients.

I also added 1 extra egg because my hash browns came in 20 oz vs. 16 oz pkg.  For ease I just used 1 whole small onion and 1 whole green pepper.  I added a little bit of "slap your mama" spice to give a little kick.

Definitely a winner!

Using (and tweaking) the below measurements, I made two half-sized casseroles: one with cheese, the other without (per request of my family.) I used a dozen eggs (instead of 8). Instead of 2 cups of milk, I did 1.5c of skim and 0.5c of half-half. Instead of bacon, I chopped up a ton of frozen turkey patties. Also added diced tomatoes, green peppers, and chopped green onions (scallions). Both casseroles turned out GREAT. Based on other recommendations, I layered the bottom of the pan with frozen hash browns, but I did not pre-brown the hash browns. I was around the ballpark of the same cooking time. The best gauge is by checking occasionally towards the tail end of the suggested cook time if the center of the casserole is firm and not runny.

YUM~ I followed advice of some of the others and then added a touch of my own.    I used 10 eggs-same  quantity of milk-so not runny with 10 eggs.  I sauted my pepper and onion first to make them softer.  We don't like them crisp.  I  had the hashbrowns in the oven baking for a bit while I was doing this so they would be crisper.  Then I mixed it all together b/c the hasbrowns were already crisp and I felt I didn't need to layer and it helped to melt the cheese too.  I also used less cheese to cut some of the fat and it turned out GREAT! However, I 'm sure it would be awesome with all that cheese too. Thanks so much for sharing.

Just made this for Easter breakfast, YUm!  I used the southwest style Simply Potatoes, turkey bacon and fat-free cheese.  I baked the potaoes first at 425 for 15 min. And then added eggs, cheese and bacon mixture to top and baked covered for 30 min. And uncovered for 15 min.

Definitely COOK THE BACON FIRST.  I was confused about that too, and thought that If I were to cook the bacon the recipe would have told me.  Thus, I made it without cooking the bacon first - just chopping it up and mixing it in -  and I thought the bacon was gross when I ate it.  However, had the bacon been cooked it would have been very very tasty

I cooked the bacon before baking.  Good thing because although this dish was great when it was finished, it took FOREVER to bake thoroughly.

This is an excellent, easy casserole with the classic "breakfast" taste you want in this kind of dish.   I followed the suggestion of a lot of the other reivews and put in a layer of the hash browns in and cooked those first, while I did that I cooked up my bacon. When the hash browns started getting toasty, I laytered the bacon on top. I don't know if it's a given or what but it seemed odd to me to but in strips of bacon, I cut mine up into pieces.   At the store, the hash brown bags I found were all larger than what the recipe called for so and I had some left over. I put about a cup into the egg/milk mixture.   I would add more onion next time, the bell pepper over powered the onion for me, but that's not too bad.  And, I should have done what other reviewers did and salt and pepper the hash browns and/or the egg mixture before it went in.   I used 1 cup of milk and it was plenty moist.  I used 4 cups of cheese and it made for a really great cheesey  top.

This was delicious. Used only 1 1/2 c. milk and cooked the potatoes and bacon in advance.  Gone instantly-should have made 2 pans!

Fantastic! I also browned the hash browns dotted with butter in the oven before baking the whole casserole to brown them first. I cut down on the bacon a little and added a pound or so of breakfast sausage as well. And because I didn't have a bell pepper I added a couple banana peppers instead which added a nice flavor and I also sauteed them with the onions a little first. I did bake it all in a 13 by 9 pan because there was no way it was going to fit into a 
7 by 11. The bake time was perfect. It was enjoyed by all and I will definitely make this again. We have our own chickens so this is a great way to use up some of the eggs when we have too many.

Great breakfast!
I fixed this as part of a church breakfast and it was great.
I did add extra peppers and onions for a little more kick and used ham instead of bacon.  I also took the advice about baking the hash browns alone before adding the eggs.
I then placed in the fridge overnight.  Baked up well the next morning.

this recipe is fairly bland, but there are opportunities to "spice" it up with additional spices and/or a different cheese.  

It also took me 45 of uncovered cooking to set the egg.

I made this for a baby shower brunch and it was a hit!  Everyone's favorite breakfast foods combined into one delicious casserole and all prepared with very little effort on my part.  The leftovers heat up in the microwave well and are almost as good as the first time.  The only change I made was to reserve a little of the cheese and sprinkle it on the top once the eggs had set up.  It made a nice topping for the casserole.  My husband said he would like it with some green chilies added so we will try that next.

YUMMY! After the 30 minute uncovered cooking time, I turned the oven off & left the dish in for 10 mins. Perfect! Took this to a potluck at church & it disappeared! Will be making this again.

Little did I know a year ago when I first made this recipe that I would be worrying about high cholesterol.  Now I use egg beaters, no fat cheese, skim milk, and turkey spam and it is still excellent.

I made this for a Ladies Brunch at our church and everyone wanted a copy of the recipe! Absolutely wonderful. I had to make one for my family and even my picky girls ate it. I substituted turkey sausage for the bacon when I made it the second time, tho, but it was still delicious.

This was super easy to make and it was really good.  I did make some changes as other reviewers suggested,  I cut the milk by 1/2, precooked the hash browns and bacon.  I also made some additions to the casserole, I added some jimmy dean sausage (cut the bacon amount in half) I also chose to soften the green peppers in the bacon fat and then added everything into the egg mixture.  It was wonderful.  My hubby said it is not a "must have"

Great! I received a lot of compliments. I did make changes though, I used 9 eggs, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 an onion, one whole bell pepper, and I baked the hash browns alone, until golden, then added the other ingredients.

I never made an egg casserole before and this looked easy.  I read a lot of the reviews and decided to take their advice.   I omitted the onion and peppers and used 2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper and mixed in with egg and milk, which I decreased to 1 cup but used whole milk for depth.  I also used cooked bacon chopped up, and added maple breakfast sausage links (about 6) also chopped up.  I also baked the has brown first as the bottom layer for 15 mins on 450.  Then I poured the egg mixture on top and baked it covered for 45 minutes on 350,  I think for using only 8 eggs this was a bit too long.  I'd probably do 30 minutes next time.  Then uncovered for @ 10 minutes.  The taste was fantastic, although I'd use a bit more salt but it was overcooked.  

This is a good base recipe to use as a framework and then add based on what flavors you want in your casserole.  Next time I'm going to try using 12 eggs and bake it for 45 minutes covered then 15 minutes uncovered.

I made this for Easter morning.  I put it together the night before and refrigerated it over night.  I used a combination of ham and bacon, browning the ham a bit just before I took the bacon out of the frying pan.  (I cut the raw bacon into bits with scissors before browning.)  Then I browned the potatoes in a little of the bacon oil.  I drained the bacon and ham on paper toweling.  I left out the pepper as some here don't like it.  This was one of two casseroles I made, and everyone preferred it to the other one.  I used a mixutre of three cheeses grated -- one was cheddar.

I made this with canned chopped green chiles because I didn't have bell peppers on hand and everyone loved it. I had to blot off some bacon grease from the top, and possibly some of the cheddar oil, but after doing that it was perfect. We like picante sauce on top, and even my picky daughter ate 2 helpings.

I have tried this several times. I doubled the recipe and have substituted ham and sausage. I also added mushrooms.  I divided it up into aluminum tins and froze them for my elderly parents.  They rave about them and love inviting their friends over for breakfast.

My family loves this recipe! I too added hash browns as a bottom layer. I used Trader Joes brand, my 13x8 dish needed 8. I baked them first only to make sure there was a crunch to them. I also used costco brand sweet Italian pork sausages 6 links (1 1/2 lbs.) which I pan fried then diced up. I used 2 to 3 cups mild cheddar, 4 whole green onions chopped, 1 1/2 chopped green bell peppers, I didn't pan fry them I just added to the egg mixture. The bell pepper had a little crunch to it which I liked. I added 1 cup of half & half to 14 eggs mixed it up then added all the ingredients in a separate bowl before pouring it over the layer of hash browns. I didn't add any other spices I found that the onions and the sweet Italian sausage made it very flavorful to my family. It is very time consuming, so plan wisely.

This recipe turned out great!  I read the reviews after making it, only to find out that people were having trouble with the hashbrowns cooking all the way through unless they precooked them.  I had no issue with this, but I wondered if those that did were using the diced potato "homefry" style and confusing it with the shredded potato "hashbrown" style.  I used the frozen shredded potato and it cooked all the way through, no extra steps required and it tasted great!  I did add 1 teaspoon salt, but that is my preference.

This was really good, and super easy to experiment with! I baked the hash browns on their own for 10 minutes or so, and used some cooked sausage in place of the bacon. I also added some spinach and mushrooms to the peppers/onions, and it was great! I might try using baguettes or sourdough bread in place of the hash browns for a twist. Good standard recipe!

I made this this morning for a dozen family members. I took the other review into consideration. I used a  9 X 13 pan, added 13 eggs, 3 cups of cheese, precooked the bacon and the potatoes O'brien. I added some garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. It needed 15 less minutes without the foil and it was perfect! Thanks!

I didn't read the reviews first that said to cook hashbrowns ahead of time, but the hashbrowns were fine - not crunchy like others said. It was the flavor - just OK.

If you like cheddar cheese you will like this recipe. Overall, the different flavors in recipe meld together. I would serve strips of bacon with the eggs, etc. The Bacon is lost in the ingredients.

I made it on MLK Day  - 5 out of 6 family members liked it.  We did not have any bell peppers so we excluded those - and I did not have 3 cups of one kind of cheese, so I shredded about 12 slices of American cheese and some Colby Jack and Mozzarella.  I didn't measure much of anything because I was already using left over hashbrowns from my kid's IHOP breakfast and that was not an exact measurement, either.  The eggs and the onion are the only thing I used the exact measurement of.  It turned out perfect, as far as we're concerned.  I would've given it 5 stars, except for it really should have called for pepper in the egg  mixture before cooking and it should say to use non-stick cooking spray on the pan before pouring the mixture in (thankfully I did this and it's going to be an easy clean-up and none will be wasted stuck to the pan)  But other than that we will make this again sometime...maybe even for Easter next time!  LOL

This was pretty good, but the bacon ended up tasting like ham since it became moist after baking.  Sausage would have been better.

I made this recipe and we had leftovers so my husband took the leftovers to work for a couple of days and his co-workers were all looking at it talking about ooh I want some.  Took this to a family Fathers Day's brunch needless to say, My husband just asked me what is that thing you made with potatoes and meat his co-workers had not eaten it before but was detailed in telling him what they say and I now have to make one for his job for their Christmas Eve 1/2 day function and then he said his Aunt Dorothy is requesting for our annual early Christmas Brunch.  I too changed the recipe I add more eggs I also use half n half or heavy cream and Louis Rich turkey sausage which I ground up and cook first and then I saute my all my veggies in butter and season so that they are um um good alone then add to my egg mixture and I use jack mild cheddar sharp cheddar and smoked cheese trust everyone loves my cooking because I always put my own little spin.  Needless to say request request request so guess while I am at it I will make one for my job as well really great recipe any cook will take it to the next level.. FYI you can also use fresh red potatoes diced they are yum too!

i make this as a breakfast pizza, but dont use any milk and only 5 eggs, 1 cup of cheese and 1 cup of hashbrowns, you take one can of cressant rolls and spread them out on a pizza pan joining at the seams, put the hashbrowns down over the dough, plain or the obrians, layer the bacon or sausage is good also, put the cheese on, beat the eggs pour in middle of pizza and bake on 375 for about 20-25 minutes and eggs spread out over entire pizza, great to grab a piece and head out the door and great as left overs the next day

I followed what other reviewers suggested by starting with just baking off the potatoes a little.  I seasoned mine and baked for about 10 minutes before adding sauteed veg and meat (used Canadian ham) and then pouring my egg mixture.  This went over like a charm with my entire family.

I used 1 cup milk, 8 eggs, mozzarella cheese, 1 lb. turkey bacon, and sliced potatoes instead of hash browns. Potatoes were cooked in oven for 15 minutes and bacon was cooked in the microwave before being chopped.
I may make this again. It was ok.

I can't figure out why several reviewers made the comment that they cooked the bacon instead of leaving it raw.  It clearly states in the directions to fry the bacon until crisp.   I've made this recipe (without the onions and bell peppers since we don't like them) for many years and never prebaked the potatoes.  I'm glad to read that suggestion (unfortunately after the fact) and will try it next time!

I was so excited for this after all the reviews. I made it exactly as listed, other than that I broiled the hash browns for about 15 minutes first. I love cheese, but there is just too much in this. The cooking time was way too long and the cheese made it rubbery. My husband liked it enough to eat it, but me and my 2 boys did not. Next time I will decrease the cheese for sure and decrease the cooking time. Its a great base to work with for sure.

This was really good; certainly one of my fave breakfast casseroles.  Made as stated except for the peppers.Next time will brown potatoes first.  Not sure it would have fit in a 7x11; I used a 9x13. Thanks for submitting, Stephanie !

All in all, this was a fabulous breakfast casserole!  Knowing I prefer dry eggs, I'll probably use 1 cup of milk next time.  Also, I pre-cooked the hashbrowns as suggested, same with the bacon.  I gave this four stars because it requires so much time and effort (2 hours) but for a first try on a recipe, I couldn't imagine it going any better.

I used potatoes o'brien so I wouldn't have to worry about chopping onions and green peppers and I browned them in the baking dish for about 15-20 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  Also, I cooked the bacon the ahead of time in the microwave to near crispy and cut it with scissors once it was cooled.  The cheese that I used was a mixture of white and yellow cheeses.  Enjoy!

I increased the recipe for 18 servings and used a 9x13 glass baking dish.  I precooked the hash browns as suggested below and used only 1 bag instead of 1.5 bags.  I precooked the peppers  and onions (PnO) to give a little brown (used one whole red pepper and 1 medium onion, used a little bacon grease to keep from sticking to pan-added tremendious flavor).  I layered the hashbrowns on the bottom, then layered some of the PnO, then some of the bacon.  The remaining PnO and bacon were mixed with the egg mix.  If you precook the bacon, hashbrowns and PnO, total prep time increases to 1.5 hrs if cooking using one pan :(    I have a convection oven and due to the very full pan I increased the temperature to 370 for 45 min with the aluminum foil.  When it came time to remove the foil, some of the mix stuck to the top. I discarded the top. I reduced the heat to 350 and continued to cook uncovered for 1/2 hr.  I could have taken it out earlier but I like it a little more golden brown than the picture.  The center set nicely and was not runny.  The sides were not burnt or dried out.  I let the casserole set for an hour and served.  Would make again.  May try substituting Canadian Bacon for regular bacon.

I loved this!  I just made to day and cut the receipe down.  I thought it was way too much milk and cheese, so I eyeballed it.  Also, I followed the other reveiwers and browned the potatoes in the oven first.  It was fantastic!!!!!

Made christmas for brunch and the family loved it. Made some minor changes because of what I had in the fridge. I used small roasting potatoes. Peeled and cubed them and then cooked with the green peppers and onions with a little canola oil and bacon grease. Then I mixed it with the egg mixture (using half evaporated milk and half lowfat milk). Used less cheese (about 2 cups) and baked in a 9X13 casserole dish for 55-60 minutes covered with foil. Delicious!

This dish turned out very well and did not last long!   I decreased the milk to 1 cup but left everything else as listed in the directions.  I do recomend bringing some salsa and/or sour creamto the table as a topping to add to the great flavor of this dish.

I used sausage instead of bacon which was very good. Our family seems to like the breakfast casseroles with the bread better than the hash browns. The hash browns gave it a different texture with the eggs.

This is great to take camping. Just pre cook the casserole and warm up when ready to eat.  It's even better the 2nd time.

I thought this was good and am going to use it for a breakfast brunch; however I gave it a 4 because I have to agree with another reviewer as I don't like my hash browns as soft as they are in this receipe. If you use bacon, make sure you cook it first and crumble it before adding it to the mixture.

This was really good.  I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out great.  My kids and hubby loved it as well.  Will make again.

Just made it for a work BREAKFAST CELEBRATION.. It was great! :o) I used the suggestion of layering the hash browns on the bottom and cooking them first, and added additional salt and pepper. VERY GOOD! ThankS!

We modified the recipe a bit based on what we had on-hand--original ore-ida roasted potatoes, boca link sausage, multi-colored stripped bell peppers, pepper jack cheese, hormel premium real crumbled bacon.  We used a nine by nine stoneware baker and cut the uncovered cook time to 15 minutes.  It tasted much better than i thought it would. It took more milk than any scrambled egg recipe but the purpose of the extra milk is to keep it from drying out during the long, 45 min covered baking time, in addition to the 30 minute uncovered baking time...rest assured the amount of milk has a purpose--- the time required is necessary.  We took it out at 15 and it was a little more moist than desired but still perfectly edible though next time we will go the full 30.  It's well worth the wait.  "he" likes it with a little ketchup :)

Great breakfast casserole! I bring it to our family Easter potluck brunch and it's always a hit. Sometimes I'll add mushrooms(sauteed 1st) or chopped tomatoes and just this morning I used the leftover tater tots from last nights dinner instead of hashbrowns. although when making for holidays, I prefer the hashbrowns. I warmed them in the microwave for about three minutes to take the chill off. It's much less time consuming to make the night before as well and it's ready to pop in the oven first thing in the morning. We always have salsa on the table to go with it.  I've made this often.

This was delicious!!  I'm not very confident when it comes to baking casseroles, actually this was my first one, but it was SO easy and yummy!  I layered the hash browns on the bottom like most people did, and it was wonderful.  Between myself, my boyfriend and his roomates it was gone within hours, and I baked it in a 9 x 13 in dish so there was a lot!  But I added in sausage and ham along with the bacon, so it was pretty big =O  But oh so good. Very yummy with sour cream and avacado on top.  I will make this again!

This was good, but it tasted more like quiche than a breakfast casserole. I'm not quite sure how I'd change it--maybe cut down on the dairy? Scramble the eggs in the hot pan as they cook? I'm not sure, but I'll keep looking for a good breakfast casserole recipe. On the other hand, having a potato crust on what was essentially a quiche made a nice change.

This was ok and received as ok by my family this morning (Easter). As suggested, I precooked the hashbrowns on the bottom of the dish for about 15 min on 350 and used purchased precooked bacon. The bacon rendered an odd flavor and the potatoes were still a little mushy and too much in quantity.  It's kind of like an oven cooked omelet on top of mushy potatoes.  I don't think I will do this again, but TY and to each their own! Maybe I'm not found of egg casseroles? PS: Not knowing whether to precook or use raw bacon is a big deterent to this recipe.

Good.  It is a bit bland; I salted and peppered both the egg and the hash browns (I layered as some other reviewers did) and I still needed some ketchup to spice it up at the table.  I think with a few more seasonings it would be wonderful.  I didn't have frozen hash browns, so I made my own with the small julienne attachment on my mandoline.  My potatoes were a bit underdone, however; I probably should have cooked them before tossing them in the casserole dish.  I think that is because commercial hashbrowns probably are cooked prior to packaging, so with commercial hashbrowns it probably would've been fine.  I added broccoli and mushrooms for the veggies and didn't put any onions in.  It really does take a long time to bake, so I made it yesterday afternoon and we warmed it in the oven this morning at 215 degrees for about 30 minutes.  I wanted to make a half batch, but I ended up with so many hashbrowns that didn't really happen, even though I halved the egg mixture amount.  I used turkey bacon and it cooked just fine within the casserole.

This was very good! I pre-cooked my bacon as well and also added cheese to the top at last 10 min. Then added fresh cut scallions to the top and served with sour cream. Perfect!

This recipe was GREAT. I made a few changes after reading the reviews before I made it and what a breakfast:D Some changes I made were: 1) I substituted the bacon for breakfast sausage and I cooked the sausage first 2) I laid 1/2 the hash browns at the bottom of pan and I top the casserole with the other 1/2.
I found that cooking the meat first then putting it into the oven uncovered only took about 30-35 minutes to cook. 
Certainly will make again. THANKS!

Great casserole! I used about 1/2 the package of shredded hash browns, 4 eggs and 1 cup of egg beaters, one cup of milk, closer to 2 cups of cheese, and turkey sausage instead of bacon. Came out delicious! Thanks! :-)

This was really good.  I added some black pepper and used diced ham.  My husband works away from home and I made this for him to eat at breakfast.  It held up really nicely over several days time, and by the time he was home he was asking for more!

This recipe is now my Favorite breakfast casserole. Thank you, Stephanie! I made this New Year’s Day - hopefully a new tradition! It’s so easy to make, directions are easy to follow, and my teenage grandsons loved it! I did add diced ham too, just because I had to use it up. I only used 1 cup of milk and the eggs/casserole still turned out nice and fluffy. And lastly, I baked the frozen hash browns in the bottom of the casserole dish at 450° for 30 minutes, then basically followed the recipe. I think if I’d followed this recipe as it is, it would be fabulous! ??

I read several reviews and decided to precook the shredded hashbrowns in a 9x13 dish for 20 min at 450 degrees.  I sprinkled seasoned salt and pepper on the hashbrowns and dotted them with butter before baking.  I browned a 1 lb roll of Bob Evans original sausage with 1/2 c. diced onion and 1/2 diced green pepper.  Next time I will up both of those including dicing the whole green pepper.  I added that mixture on top of the partially cooked potatoes, then topped with 2 cups shredded mild cheddar cheese, and then the egg/milk/salt/pepper mixture (12 eggs & 1 1/2 c. milk).  Baked covered at 375 degrees for 35 min, and then uncovered for 30 min more at 350 degrees.  Really great dish.  I prefer this much more than a bread-based breakfast casserole.

This recipe was okay, but it was better with fresh potatoes, which I put through the food processor. Using potatoes that weren’t frozen would make it easier than having raw, although I still followed the advice of other users, who said to put them in the oven before mixing the ingredients. My dad being a vegetarian, I couldn’t use meat, so I excluded that. I added one clove of minced garlic, reduced the amount of milk to 1 1/2 cups and used 16 eggs.

I also substituted the hash browns with tator tots. It's what made it much thicker. The turkey bacon and turkey sausage made it taste so sinful,  I just wanted to keep eating... Hahahahaha...

Like many of the other reviewers, I precooked the hashbrowns and the bacon, and I layered the hashbrowns on the bottom of the pan.  My other alterations:  I used Potatoes O'Brien to  replace hashbrowns, onion and peppers.  I also used 1 cup fiesta mix cheese  and 2 cups of cheddar.  Further, I used an 11 x 13 pan, and only cooked it for about 30 mins at 350 uncovered.   I wish I read the reviews that said to season this because it was bland.  Other than that, it was perfect.

Had to use frozen hashbrown patties but took the advice of others and precooked with some butter first.  And sauteed my veggies  (added mushrooms) before adding to eggs.  I cut down the cheese to two cups and down to 1/2  pound bacon. Was able to cut the covered cook time by 15 mins.  Everyone loved!

Like many of the other reviewers, I bake the hash browns in a hot oven (400 degrees) until browned and then I pour the other ingredients over the top. I use a little less milk 1.5 cups, with the half of cup half and half and the full cup 2% milk.  This is a delicious casserole that we eat over and over again a few times a year.

It was oily and heavy.  It might have been that the bacon needed to cook longer to crispen up before being added.

I cooked the hashbrowns for 20 minutes in the oven on 450, then stirred in the other ingredients and cooked for another 40 minutes on 350 (20 covered, 20 uncovered).

I did add salt and pepper and omitted the green pepper (we didn't have any).  It was yummy!  My husband liked it better with spicy sauce and I might add tomatoes, or use potatoes O'Brien next time!

I used turkey bacon and only 1.5 cups of skim milk.  I also followed what others said to brown the hash browns first.  It came out really good although a bit salty for my taste.

I tripled this recipe to make enough to serve brunch to all 23 members of my immediate family & it went over very very well! In one 9x13 pan, I only used bacon & onion (along with the egg, cheese, & hash browns) so that it was more appetizing to the kids. In the other 9x13 pan, in order to appeal to the adult pallet, I used the ingredients mentioned above and added 1 diced tomato.
I also baked the hash browns for 20 minutes at 425 before adding the rest of the ingredients & this provided a nice crispy base. I will make this again, without a doubt!!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast. It was delicious, but I did take the advice of other reviewers and layer the potatoes first on the bottom of the dish. I baked them for about 15 minutes then added the bacon, onions and peppers that I sautéed together for a few minutes. I layered the cheese on top and then on Christmas morning I mixed the eggs with some salt, pepper and hot sauce, poured over the veggie-meat-cheese mixture and baked for about an hour, as directed. I will be making this again for sure!!

I experimented alil as I always like my own spin on things. I preheated oven to 450. And I thought buttering the hashbrowns for crispy bottom was a great idea. I followed the ingredient portions except for the hashbrowns probabably. I really just used them for the bottom crust and a handful in the egg mix. But I eyeballed the time and tooth picked it. Awesome!

I have this is the oven as I type. I changed a few things after reading many reviews. I used a ham steak that I had on hand, 12 eggs, Nature's Seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. I used OreIda Potatoes O'Brien dotted with butter and sprinkled generously with seasonings. Pre-baked for 30 min at 375. Diced the ham and browned it lightly. Used a dozen eggs, 2 cups milk and seasoned the eggs with the above spices. I didn't have shredded cheese, so I cubed most of a package of Queso Blanco Velveeta. Layered starting with hashbrowns, then ham, cheese cubes, and poured the egg mixture over it all. Sounds wonderful, cannot wait to see how it turns out! Will update! OH MY GOSH!!! It was fabulous!!! The Queso Blanco gave it just a touch of spiciness and we all loved it! Glad I took some leftovers to work one morning, because my husband ate the rest of it at lunch that same day! I was disappointed there was no more :(

Use the suggestion of precooking potatoes! Used less milk (1 cup) and 10 eggs. Total cook time 40 covered and 6-10 uncovered. Yummy!!

These is a good recipe.  I use a tube of breakfast sausage and I crumble as I brown in your skillet.  I cut back on the green pepper as i seem to think it tends to become overpowering (probably good as is, I am just not fond of cooked green peppers; I use yellow or red ones).  Kudos to the cook.

I did not have any cheddar so I substiuted by crumbling about 5 or 6 slices of american cheese. I don't think I put enough because I really couldn't taste it. Really great recipe though, I'm sure with the proper cheese it'll only be better.

Considering the various ingredients this takes to make, I was not at all impressed with the results. The only real flavor I got out of this was..."salty!"
I had hoped this would become our Easter morning tradition, but it certainly won't be. And the time it took to make was totally not worth it in my opinion!

Very tasty!  I would also recommend pre-cooking the hash-browns before you put in the egg mixture.  I also have used Tatter Tots in place of hash-browns.

Made this for after prom party so I made it more teen friendly...no peppers, green onion instead and half ham/half bacon.  Also I wanted more than 11X7 so I added more of everything and it was great.

We loved it! I made it for Easter Brunch and there was nothing left!! Everyone loved it! I just used a little less bacon, added some ham and more onions and peppers and did the home fries mixed in with the vegetables. I was cooking 2 other casseroles and a ham at the same time so it took a little longer. I cooked it for about 2 hours. But I think if it was by itself it would have taken less time. Yummo! I will definitely be making this again & again!!

This was fantastic!  I followed the first "most helpful" recommendation to layer the hash browns first, then brown them in oven and add the remaining ingredients. I would definitely agree NOT to mix the hash browns into the egg mix.  Cook them separate as a base layer and you will NOT be disappointed.

Wonderful recipe! Made some adjustments per older reviews...and some of my own. First...I healthied it up by converting all to organic. Secondly, I substituted bacon with jalapeño chicken sausage. I used 8 eggs and 6 tablespoons of egg whites...less cholesterol :) One and one half cup of 1% org milk and pepper only. 
The hash browns I put in a greased pan per other suggestions with salt and pepper in a 425 degree oven for 30 minutes. I used sweet onion, red, yellow and green bell pepper for color. All amounts matched the recipe as noted.
To make it a complete food group recipe, I roasted organic asparagus in a 400 oven for 9 mins, cut it up and put it in the egg mixture with the sautéed onion and peppers. I used 1 1/2 cups of organic jack and white sharp cheddar...again in the egg mixture. Poured all over the baked hash browns and cooked per the recipe. At the last 10 min I topped with pepper jack...I took the advice of others and let it it 10 minutes to set. Served with org strawberries...complete great meal! Husband said "home run"!!!! Will do again with new and different substitutions :)

This is wonderful!  Super easy recipe.  The only changes I made was to add green chilies instead of green pepper.  I also put it in a larger pan and didn't need to cook it as long.  This is a keeper!

I really wanted to mix the hash browns in like the recipe calls for but also read the reviews about it falling apart if you do so. I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp. baking powder and it held together beautifully!!!

the video shows you cook the bacon, then the veggies, then the hash browns first.   mix the eggs, milk and cheese, mix in cooked and crumbled bacon and then mix in the veggies and hash browns mixture.   The video is completely different from the recipe posted that says to add the veggies raw to the casserole pan!

Ehhhh....this tastes fine but it took WAY WAY too long to cook. I think a quiche tastes pretty much the same and would cook in at least half the time. I won't be making again.

I like the recipe, it was a good base to start with. I used one cup of milk and in place of the other heated up a mixture of cream cheese and Greek yogurt instead. I also added salt and pepper to season it. It was awesome!

Love This, It Perfect For A Breakfast For The Week or So. I Did Change A Few Things, Instead Of Bell Pepper (i'm not a fan), I Added A Spoon Full Of Minced Garlic, And A Little extra Cheese. I Also Seasoned It, I Made One Of These A While Back And it Was Kinda Blah, I Added seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, Some Bacon Flavored Seasoning And Salt. Turned Out AWESOME!!! Will Totally Make Again :)

Eggcelent! (yes I meant to spell it that way).  The only change I made was to use turkey polska kielbsa because that's the only thing I had on hand that could pass as breakfast meat.

Easy to prepare.  I made it the day before using fresh potatoes cubed, which I slightly cooked first. Used only half the egg yolks and all the egg whites.  My bacon was lightly smoked and not fatty.  Replaced 1/4 cup of the milk (cuz I ran out) with a coffee sweetener (Sweet Italian Cream) which I think added a nice touch to the dish.  Everyone at the cabin thought it was delish!

I used turkey sausage instead of bacon and southwestern hashbrowns.  Casserole was devoured.  I will be making this again and again.  I think I will serve with salsa next time.

I revised this, like so many others did. I cooked the Potatoes O'Brien in the oven for 20 min. On top of that I put sausage, I had precooked. Then, I put the egg, milk, cheese mixture. It was a big hit for Easter brunch.

Made this on the fly this morning with ingredients on hand.  I had bacon already crumbled and red onion in the fridge.  I added salt, pepper, and a Kona coffee seasoning I love because the recipe seemed a little shy on seasonings.  Came out fabulous - fluffy and tasty.  Will keep in my breakfast casserole collection.

So good! Some changes to feed my family of 7- used a dozen eggs, baked hash browns in 425 oven for 15 minutes, right in the bottom of the greased 9x11 casserole dish, then layered diced (uncooked) onions, whatever breakfast meat on hand, then egg,milk, and cheese mixture with some chopped fresh parsley, top with whatever cheese you'd like. Bake covered 350* oven for 45 minutes, uncover and continue bake for 15 minutes.

I made a few changes and it was great!  I did bake the hashbrowns first - at 350 maybe for 30-40 minutes?  I forget exactly.  They didn't get browned, but I think it helped.  I used 10 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of milk and about 3/4 cup of low fat sour cream.  I used salt and pepper in the eggs and on top of the potatoes.  I also used turkey bacon- not quite a pound.  I also probably just used 2 cups of cheese, which was fine.  It was great!  I'll have to remember what I did for next time I make it.

instead of frozen potatoes, i used the dried hash browns in a carton (following the directions on carton). I also saute the onions, bell pepper and mushrooms lightly before layering. i then pour egg and cheese mixture over the layers and cook un covered for 45 to 60 mins.  this is delicious with sausages, cooked, cut up and layered over the potatoes.

This recipe is fantastic.  The only feedback I would like to offer that I split the recipe into two casserole dishes becauase I did not think that everything would fit in a 7 x 11 dish.  I put half in the 7 x 11 and the other half in a square 6 x 6.  it cut down on cooking time by 30 minutes.  I also browned the hash browns first and the dish turned out great!

I love this recipe. Although what I use is one can of pet milk instead of whole milk. Also you can substitute ham or sausage for the bacon. I want to try it with choriso.

This was really good. I also baked the hash browns first (I used patties) in the bottom of the pan and then added the egg mixture. When it was done I sprinkled a little more cheddar cheese on top and broiled it for a minute. I will be making this often. For our kids I did the same but skipped the onions and peppers.

Cooked this today for my book club brunch and served it with blueberry scones.  Everyone commented on how good it was. I took other reviewers' advice and baked the hash browns first. I also added some green chiles and used O'Brien hash browns that come with onions and peppers to save time.  I think the bacon really gives this dish its flavor. It was delicious and very easy to prepare. I will definitely make this one again.

I carmeleized the onion and used left over honey ham. I'm giving 4 stars because I think the recipe should be modified to reflect the posts of pre-cooking the taters. Wicked easy and well recieved by all. Will make again.

I layered the bacon on the top instead of mixing it in because I have one non-bacon eater. The casserole was very bland but that may have been because the bacon wasn't mixed in. Cook time was longer than I expected. I browned hashbrowns first too.

I love this recipe.  It's a hit with my family.  I've made it a few times and on two occassions I forgot to add the milk and it still turned out great. Like others I bake the hash browns first. The last time I made it, I layered a store bought crescent roll on top and baked it with the last 16 minutes of cook time.  YUMMY!  This is a keeper!!!!

Didn't have frozen hash browns, so I peeled and shredded 4 medium sized (enough to equal 16 oz.) red potatoes and baked at 400 for about 20 min.  I only used 1 1/2 c. milk and kept everything else the same and shortened the baking time to 25 min. uncovered.

My mother-in-law is allergic to gluten so this recipe has served us well on many a get-together.  I mix it up with Mexican Velvetta & sausage & salsa on top with melted cheddar & sour cream on the side for Mexican flair.

Mmmm so good and easy!  I precooked the bacon and hasbrowns to cut down on baking time. I made a "crust" with the hashbrowns instead of putting them into the mixture.  I added a little more cheese, just becasue I LOVE cheese. I am looking forward to preparing this for guests!

Made for 15 of my family members for breakfast last weekend. I wanted to take a picture, but it went so quickly and I didn't have any left overs. I cooked the potatoes first as others suggested. This casserole really takes a long time to cook, but worth it. Everyone liked it.

I made this for breakfast this morning. I omitted the peppers cause I didn't have any. I also made my own hashbrowns. This made the baking time much shorter. It only took 45 min. The taste was great. My 2 year old even loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

I liked this, but think may be better with less hashbrowns. I did add a scoop of sour cream and I layered hashbrowns, butter (a few slices for flavor), onion and bacon, cheese, then poured the eggs cheese and sour cream mix over top. Next time I'll try 1/2 the hashbrowns and more cheese.

This was good! I didn't have any bacon so I just left it out (will def. add it next time). I added garlic and salt and pepper to the eggs. I also put the hashbrowns on bottom and left a little bit to garnish on top w/ some cheese. Thanks for posting this, it was exactly what I was looking for with the materials I had. :)

Very good!  My family of 6 gobbled it right up.  Thanks so much.  The only thing that I did differently was add salt,pepper,garlic powder,1/2 cup of sour cream,tabasco sauce & I did precook and crumble the bacon and shredded my own potatoes and salt/peppered it and threw in oven prior to adding the mixture to the dish.  Thanks to previous posters whom mentioned to cook the bacon and potatoes first and layer the potatoes on the bottom.  Everything came out perfectly. The only thing that I'd change is the name of this casserole :)

A very easy prep dish - as my wife doesn't eat pork, I included more green pepper, onion, and also included some mushrooms.  I put in a full bag of the refrigerated Simply Potatoes and it was way too much.  Also, not having a 7x11 pan, I used the longer 9.5x13.5 glass dish.  For the size, I think I could have added more egg mixture and less hashbrowns.  Mine did cook in the specified time and I prepped it the night before.  Next time I'll find something else to add in for taste (more salt/pepper, jalapeno peppers, tomato).

If you let the potatoes thaw before putting them in- it decreases your cooking time as well.

This was pretty good. I used sliced ham lunch meat instead of bacon because I hate bacon grease and also added chopped bell peppers. It took a little long to cook and my overnight guests were up waiting for it to cook. Guess next time I'll have to get up a little earlier.

I made this for our Easter sunrise service breakfast at church and got a lot of compliments.  As some of the previous reviewers did, I also made the hashbrowns first and used them to layer the bottom of the casserole dish. I then mixed the remaining ingredients and poured it on top of the hashbrowns and baked it.  Unfortunately, that didn't seem to solve the problem of the hashbrowns being "mixed in."  The egg mixture still went down into the hashbrowns and it didn't taste like I'd tried to separate them at all.  It was still very good, though!  I'll definitely make it again!

Holiday hit! This was a smash hit Christmas morning! I modified this recipe using suggestions from some reviews and my own tweaks. I cooked the hashbrowns which I brushed with olive oil separately first in the bottom of the pan until lightly brown. Before baking, I added several shakes of black pepper and fresh cracked sea salt and garlic. For the egg mix, I used 1.5 cups milk, Jimmy Dean pork sausage crumbles instead of bacon, Kraft Creamy Melt Shredded Cheddar, 1/2 c chopped onion, 8 eggs, and no bell pepper. Once the egg mixture was added and almost done baking, I add thin slices of beef steak to the top along with 8 slices of uncured applewood smoked bacon precooked earlier. I sprinkled a bit of a 5 cheese Italian blend over everything and finished for about 10 more minutes in the oven. Crazy good!

This is a great recipe-- my husband and kids love it.  It's easy to prep the night before and just pop it into the oven the next morning.  However, I did make some changes:
Like many others mentioned, 2 cups of milk seemed like too much.  I used 1 cup of milk instead.  Another great addition is to use "Simply Potatoes"  steakhouse seasoned diced potatoes.  (You can find these in a green package in the refrigerated section at the supermarket, usually near the eggs.)  Bacon is great but pork sausage is also really good. 
 This recipe smells amazing when it's cooking, and tastes delicious.   Definitely a keeper!

I followed the other suggestions and layered the bottom with the hashbrowns and baked it at 425 until brown. i added salt and pepper to taste, the egg and vegetable mixture with 1 and half cups of milk and bacon and baked at 350. Delicious!

My family gobbled this one up. I browned the potatoes first.  I also substituted diced ham for the onions & peppers (for my picky eaters).

I wanted to try something different for an egg casserole so I made this for Easter, followed the option to put hash browns on bottom and cook til golden brown...it looked great, smelled great but was just okay. My other recipe is way better. Live and learn ..

Love this recipe! I made half in a muffin tin and the other half in a casserole dish. Both turned out excellent! The muffin casseroles I am putting in the freezer. I forgot to add the hashbrowns. Oh well, they were wonderful. Next time I will try the hashbrowns. FYI my gluten-free neighbor can eat my muffins because they are gluten-free without the hashbrowns. Either way you can’t lose hashbrowns or no hashbrowns this is a fantastic recipe!

I used half a pound of chopped ham instead. I also added half a teaspoon of seasoning salt and a quarter teaspoon of pepper. I made sure the hash browns were fully thawed before adding them and I used a 9x13. It still took the same length of time but it cooked through and was great!

I made this for a Church Women's breakfast meeting.  Had several compliments and recipe requests.  I shortened the prep time a little by using a 20 oz bag of O'Brien potatoes with onions and bell pepper  in place of the 16 oz bag of hashbrowns and the dicing the  onion and bell pepper.

It turned out light and fluffy and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again.

This was an excellent breakfast casserole. It’s helpful though to brown the hash browns before adding along with the other ingredients. Blended shredded cheeses work well also. I used bacon the first time I made the casserole and then I tried ham, and then sausage. My favorite combination was the time I combined both bacon and ham and both shredded cheddar cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese. Also used shallots in addition to a red onion for added flavor and color appeal. It’s a fun and versatile recipe! And, is my dad’s favorite!

This will be my go to egg bake.  I agree with the others that baked & seasoned the hashbrowns first.  It went over great for my Easter brunch!  Served this with the 90 min cinnamon rolls & fresh cut fruit.

Made this for Easter Brunch.  Made it with real potatoes though.  
Made it the night before, baked it and just popped it in the oven to reheat - everyone loved it.

I made it as part of my Easter brunch meal. I did add an extra egg, some salt and pepper however, kept the rest of the receipe the same and it came out wonderfully and very delicious. My guest enjoyed it immensely. This will definitely be a repeat dish. Double kudos.

This was really easy and the family loved it! I did follow the suggestions of others and put the hash browns in the casserole dish and bake it for 15 mins then poured the egg mixture over the top. I didn’t realize that the bacon was maple until I started cooking it. The casserole came out really good even using maple bacon.

Made this for Easter. I should have followed reviews and put the potatoes on the bottom. This also needs seasoning badly. Overall I was disappointed. It's a good start but the recipe needs help.

Truly one of the most delicious breakfast  recipes that I have ever made.    I had 11 people for brunch the day before Easter.   They all loved it, even the kids didn't complain.   Super easy and can't wait to serve it again.

We're  vegetarians so I  eliminated the bacon. I  was going to use meatless sausage but in the end I didn't and we still liked it. Will definitely do it again.

This was my 1st time making this and it turned out DELICIOUS! I read some of the comments 1st and i did layer the hash browns on the bottom first and browned them with some butter in the over at 450. I didnt use shredded like it said i used cubed it still did the job i also instead of using 8 eggs i used 10. Definitely on my families keep list.

An Easter brunch winner!  Like others, I browned the hash browns in a pan first and then layered them on the bottom of the dish.  I also sautéed the bell pepper and onion before mixing it in.  Used chicken sausage instead.  This dish is a crowd pleaser!

I made this with no alterations and it came out perfect! I was tempted to add cheese on top during the final cooking process, but am glad I didn't, it had the perfect blend of cheese throughout.

I read through most of the reviews and modified my casserole similarly.  I sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and the onions the night before.  I mixed half ham and half bacon, and I used half and half instead of milk, decreasing that to 1 cup.  I did bake the hash browns first, dotting with butter before baking for 30 minutes.  I layered as mentioned in the reviews.  My batch was doubled so baking took another hour.  **Changes I would make next time: after baking the hash browns, I would add the rest of the ingredients and stir it so it wasn't so potato heavy at the bottom.

I have several of these recipes and they are wonderful.  There are 3 BIG problems with this one.  First, the potatoes go in the bottom of the dish, and everything else is poured on top.  The pan size should be 9x13.  And most importantly, you are supposed to assemble this the NIGHT BEFORE and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before baking.

I followed the recipe but made a few adjustments... to reduce fat and calories I used turkey bacon and half 2% and half fat free cheese. I also used fat free milk and removed two egg yolks from the mixture.  I adjusted the milk to 1 1/2 cups and followed other reviews to bake the potatoes at 450 for 10 minutes.  I also pre cooked  the onions and peppers and bacon. Next time I will layer the bacon on top of the potatoes.

This recipe was okay but kinda bland and tasteless. I layered the hash browns instead, which I think turned out better. Would not make this exact recipe again.

Great dish! Couldn't find frozen, shredded hash browns so I used OreIda potatoes with onion and green pepper. Cooked them on the stovetop, then put them on the bottom of a flat casserole dish first. Placed egg/cheese mix on top. Great flavor, will absolutely make this again.

I followed the suggestions of previous reviews in baking the hash browns first, but added a light layer of the shredded cheddar cheese, dabs of butter and 1 Cup of crushed seasoned croutons and then baked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then I continued with the rest of the instructions and ingredients listed in the recipe and added 1 cup of chopped ham as well as the bacon.  My guests loved it and came back for seconds.  By adding the ham it served 14 instead of twelve.

I made this for the Easter Sunday potluck at church, and was told by several that it was great! Made a double batch, but I think it doesn't quite need to have the milk doubled. And I'm confident it will be equally good with ham, or sausage! Of course, there IS a side-benefit from using bacon: you get beautiful bacon grease to cook your fried eggs in for the following few days!

I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!!!

I used turkey bacon. Everyone loved it and even had some leftover for the next day.  My other guests loved it, too. 
I used Trader Joe frozen hash brown that I thawed and precooked for over half an hour, as suggested by others. This is very important.
Looking forward to trying it again!

Tasted great.  I browned the potatoes and put together the other ingredients separately the day before.   I sauteed red peppers and onions before mixing with eggs.  The day of, I just poured the filling over the potatoes and baked.  Really easy!

I did not use green bell peppers.  I also added salt and pepper.  I had not read the baking time involved so that was a surprise.  But it was a nice casserole and everyone liked it.  I didn't see what some had said about cooking the hash browns first and I wish I had because I think that would make it perfect.

Having read the other reviews, it confirmed what I was going to do anyways. After cooking the bacon, I fried chopped tomato and then added the hash browns.  After putting those in a 9X11 pan, sprinkled 1/2 the shredded cheese and topped with the crumbled bacon.  Used a full medium white onion, medium green pepper and bundle of green onions. Fried in some bacon grease until tender. Used the 8 eggs but only 1 cup of milk, added onion/green peppers and rest of the cheese. Baked as per the recipe - was a huge hit!

Super simple! I read the reviews and I also cut the milk to 1 cup & baked the hash browns first for about 10 minutes. Poured the mixture on top. Best part about this is that everyone in the family loves it, including the kiddos.

Instead of using the Chedder cheese I used Colby-Jack.  It gave the casserole a milder taste which I prefer.

This was delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and cooked the hash brown at the bottom of the pan first for about 10 minutes. After adding the rest of the ingredients, it only took about 25 min to cook (although I did cut down the recipe). I will def make this again

I did not add the peppers, but included everything else.  I am the queen of breakfast casseroles (according to my sweetie, of course), but I've always used bread, not hash browns.  It was delicious, but I felt very heavy.  Even my guy said he was full the entire day after having several servings at Christmas brunch.  I would definitely make this again, maybe trying some variations, sausage instead of bacon?  Looks beautiful in the pan, cooks evenly and maintains it's shape even when cut and on the plate!!!

I layered the hasbrown in the pan first, sautéed the onions and added them to the hashbrowns, then bacon, eggs, and cheese. I also added some garlic powder (about 2 tbsp) salt and pepper to taste. So far, it looks exactly like ones I've made in the past.

I mostly followed the original directions, which says to brown the bacon first, and use thawed hash browns.  I use Ore'Ida shredded hash browns.  I didn't add onions or  peppers just because of personal preference, but added onion powder, garlic powder, and Tony Chasseries (not sure if that's spelled right) in place of the onions and bell pepper.  Because of the Tony's, I didn't have to add salt or pepper.  This turned out perfect for me and I've cooked it 2 times a week for the past few weeks and it gets devoured.  The hashbrowns are not crispy when cooked as written, so if you like them crispy, maybe just pre-cook them as others have suggested. This recipe is delicious.

I made this recipe for four, I realized that I wasn't going to have enough bacon so I used sausage instead, I cooked it then added it to the egg mixture. I also followed the advice of others and placed the hash browns in the over for about 10-15 minutes before I added the egg mixture. It was delicious!

Great breakfast casserole that can be thrown together right before baking. I added some mushrooms 


 when I sautéed the onions and bell peppers--we like lots of veggies in with our eggs. I also added some minced garlic  when sautéing the vegetables. I used some smoked cheddar cheese that I had. The proportions of the recipe were spot on. Sorry I rated my modifications for the recipe.

I loved this casserole. I've made it several times.  I sautéed the onions, peppers and hash brown potatoes in a small amount of the bacon drippings before adding them to the eggs. I also did not bake it as long because the bottom tends to get too brown. This is a great alternative to other egg casseroles that include Bisquick.

I've made this at least 5 times now:
1.  Follow the advice in the reviews and cook the hashbrowns and bacon first.  I don't usually season my hashbrowns, so I was fine with plain hashbrowns.  However, seasoning the uncooked hashbrowns with garlic power, onion powder, and salt and pepper definitely made it better.
2.  I prefer to cook all of my veggies before baking them for a sauteed flavor- so I sauteed the onions and peppers before baking.
3.  I've made several versions of this for several brunches- all veggie, substituted ham for the bacon, etc.  My advice is cook the meat and veggies the way you want them- so if you want roasted red peppers, roast the peppers before you bake them.  If you prefer crispy bacon, made crispy bacon before baking.
I've added spinach, green chilis, tomatoes, deli ham, canadian bacon, mushrooms, and green onions to this and loved every dish!

A no fail recipe in my book.

Came out excellent. I did a little experiment, where I used leftover seasoned chicken and baked potatoes, so that I can make room in my fridge. I also replaced the sharp cheddar with mozzarella cheese. This recipe is easy to make and very flavorful. I diced up the baked potatoes and then seasoned with salt & pepper. This is a recipe worth keeping.

We didn't have peppers,  and we substituted ham for bacon, and diced potatoes for real hashed browns, but it was still popular! I had no trouble with the recipe not turning out, though I disregarded the general advice to put the potatoes at the bottom. I give it four stars instead of five only because it doesn't make for a full meal by itself.

This was really yummy. I listened to the other reviewers and used sausage instead of bacon (personal preference), precooked the hash browns (DEFINITELY DO THIS!!) and added lots more spices.  Another reviewer had said that she used half of it to fill tortillas for breakfast burritos- brilliant!  Next time I will add more cheese, and possibly more egg.

It had a bad texture with the hash browns mixed in and it took a lot longer to cook in the center than the instructions call for.  I won't make again.

The 30 minute version: 

I've made this before and really enjoyed it. However, this time I adapted it to reduce time and to the likings of my family.

They didn't have any hash browns at the store so I bought frozen hash brown patties to make do.  Microwaved them for 90 seconds and baked them in a greased casserole dish for 10 minutes (flipping half way).  While they were baking I fried the bacon (8 slices) and prepped the eggs, milk (only 1 cup), seasoning, and cheese (only 8 ozs.) mix;  I left out the bell pepper and onions.  After adding the bacon into the mix, I poured it on top of the hash browns and baked for 15 more minutes.  (Optional) At the last minute top with more cheese and melt.  (Optional) Garnish with green onions, chives or salsa for that extra punch.

Turned out crunch on the bottom, fluffy on top, and very flavorful.

I wanted to pare down the servings so used 5 eggs and a little less milk and an 8 X 8 inch dish.  As one reviewer suggested, I prepared it the night before by first baking the hashbrowns (dotted with a little butter) for 30 min @ 425F , then adding toppings (onion, bacon, peppers, cheese and a little garlic powder, pepper and paprika), then the egg/milk mixture.  Refrigerated overnight and then followed baking instructions of recipe:  bake covered with foil for 45 min followed by about 30 minutes uncovered.

The family loved this!  I baked the potatoes first as many others did. I used Simply Potatoes Southwestern Style Hash Browns which added excellent seasoning to the dish.  I plan to use leftovers in breakfast burritos and will definitely make this again!

My husband n I had it for breakfast after Easter Mass on Sunday .I made it  the night before. We  reheated it in the microwave for about 1-1/2 minutes. It was delicious, since it was the two of us, I shared  it with my neighbors. Next time I will make it with my family. To me it was more like a quiche, yes, I will make it again.  Gail

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand for this, but the revisions I made still made this casserole come out great! Instead of store bought hash browns I just shredded the same amount of fresh potatoes. I only had 1 cup of milk on hand so I used that & 1 cup of sour cream. And instead of just using cheddar cheese, I used 1.5 cups sharp cheddar cheese & 1.5 cups pepper jack cheese which gave it a slight kick. The casserole turned out great & was a hit!

Enjoyed this for Christmas breakfast.  Had family from out of town and we all enjoyed it. Followed the recipe as describe and didn't change any thing. Served with biscuits and fruit salad.  Will definitely make this again.

Followed advise of other reviewers.  Baked hash browns for 30 minutes first.  I also decrease the amount of milk by half and added a splash of heavy cream.  Decreased  cheese by half and added sauteed mushrooms seasoned with salt and pepper.
Update: 12/2016 - Prepped day before.  Mixed butter with frozen hash browns, salt, and pepper. Spread on bottom of pan.  Added toppings.  Mixed about 12 eggs with 1/2 cup milk and pour over top.  Baked per instructions the next day.  It was perfect.

This was amazing.  I followed the suggestion of browning the hash browns first in the pan.  Then I added everything but the kitchen sink to the filling.  Mushrooms, ham, bacon and broccoli.   I put them over the hash browns and then poured the egg mix over the whole thing.  I did use seasoning salt and red pepper flakes to add some kick.  *Perfect*!!!

I have made this recipe a couple of times, both times were great! One time I made it without the meat and substituted veggies instead. I kept the onions, added different colored peppers, broccoli, baby spinach, and fresh mushrooms. Huge hit with my coworkers!

Loved the pre-bake of the potatoes and the addition of seasoning to them prior to baking.  Had I used bacon, it would have been better....BUT, the REAL reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that the ratio of milk to eggs was so far off.

Made this for the first time Easter morning.  Had last minute breakfast guests. Soooo good!  Got rave reviews, and I'm making another one this morning.  I followed advice of others and prebaked the potatoes.  This is definitely a keeper. Thank you, Stephanie, for this delicious base recipe.

My kids and husband loved it, and they're hard to please. I replaced the hash browns (I don't usually have them on hand) with some left over baked potatoes that I sliced up and fried in the bacon grease. I used a 9 x 13 pan so it would cook faster. I baked it for 45 minutes covered, and 15 minutes uncovered. I will definitely make this again.

Used one can of condensed milk and small red pepper instead of milk and green bell pepper.  Baked and browned potatoes first, then poured mixture on top and baked about 50 minutes at 350.  Lots of compliments!

This recipe required a longer cooking time in my oven.  If it is assembled as directed (with precooking the bacon) I would cook uncovered.  It needed an extra 30 minutes to be fully cooked.  I like the idea of using hash browns with onions and peppers already included.  I added more green pepper than suggested, onion flakes, salt and pepper.  Tabasco would be a good touch, or maybe pepper jack.  It was slightly bland.  Will make again, but with less milk.  Everyone enjoyed it; too bad we had to wait for it.  I had allowed for an extra 15 minutes of cook time.

This is a great cores pleaser! It was the first dish to go!!!
I took the advice of others and added more eggs, used croutons and half and half! 
This is what I did:
9 eggs
2 cups of half and half milk
2 cups of medium cheddar cheese
3/4 teaspoon of dry mustard
2 bags of mrs. Cubbisons seasoned croutons Texas Toast Bread
1.5 lbs of sugar house maple chicken sausage by Amylu (purchased at Costco)

Mix together, let sit overnight in the frig. 
Took it out 30 min prior to baking. Bake 1 hour at 350 covered with foil. Then 15 min with cover off at 325.

I made this for Christmas brunch, and it was a hit. This will definitely be one dish I will make again. I'm positive it will be great with other combinations of meats and vegetables as long as you keep the potato, egg and cheese parts.

This was a great egg casserole.  I brought it to the office for breakfast and everyone loved it.  It's easy to make but it does take some time. I used turkey sausage instead of bacon and diced green chilis (the canned type) instead of bell peppers.  I also used part half and half and part fat free milk to make my fat free milk richer.

I used the shredded hashbrowns rather than the cubed type.

Wow delish, cooked hash browns on the bottom first, sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Reduced milk to 1/2 added low fat sour cream and more garlic powder. so yummy

Really loved it. Lite and fluffy. I used egg substitute for half the eggs and black forest ham instead of bacon. I also substituted  red and yellow bell for green. So easy and delicious.

browning the hashbrowns first was a great idea needed a little more seasoning.

This is the best breakfast casserole I've had.  My family loved it.  It's a great "Leftover" food as well!
