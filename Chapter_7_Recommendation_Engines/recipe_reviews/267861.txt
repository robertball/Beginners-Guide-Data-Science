The only thing I did different was replace fresh green beans with the spinach (I forgot it, or I would have used it). I microwaved the cut up beans 5-8 minutes and then cooked them with the bacon and onion I added at the last minute (ok, 2 changes). This was delicious and I will be making it again!

Loved this recipe. We only swapped out the blue cheese for feta. Not huge fans of blue cheese and find it overpowering. Highly recommend and really easy to make. One of those dishes that everyone will eat.

It was amazing! Substituted blue cheese for goat cheese, and used turkey bacon, but nonetheless it was wonderful! Cooked the squash in the instant pot and then put the filling in and baked. Will definitely make again!

very good.  Had left over bacon so that saved some prep time.  Used coconut oil instead of the bacon grease.  Made 3 servings.   Will definitely make it again.

I loved it! I made this because I have a vegetarian daughter so i didn't have bacon on it, I added carrots and garlic. All 3 of my girls liked it. I added avocado as well after it was done cooking. Will definitely make again!

This came out SO good my fiancee and I could not stop eating it for anything. I plan to make this for our big family holiday dinner and I know it's going to be a smashing hit.

Wow, we loved the combination of flavors in this recipe! The blue cheese kick really seals the deal. I baked the spaghetti squash for only 35 minutes and it was cook thoroughly enough to my liking. The only change I would make next time is to increase the amount of mushrooms and spinach.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for but I baked it in the microwave instead of the oven and it couldn't have been any better.  It is the perfect side dish for a cold winter day and I may make it in the oven then when it's colder outside.  Spaghetti squash is one of my favorite veggies and this just made my love of it stronger.

I already had roasted a spaghetti squash and scooped it out into storage containers.  I cooked the bacon and mushrooms first, then tossed in all the other ingredients using garlic powder since it was one serving.  I let everything get hot then added the sour cream and heated a little more   I used all the ingredients, but didn't measure - it was delicious!

It's been a while since I've had spaghetti squash but I had one and mushrooms that I needed to eat. I found this recipe and OH MY GOODNESS! I'm blown away at how delicious it is. I will definitely be making it again!
