Finally a good recipe for veggie dip that is a little different. So so easy too. Five stars. I halved everything only because I didn't have the full 2 cups of mayonnaise. Give all the flavours a chance to work their magic by a night in the fridge. My whole family ejoyed it. Kids and all!Thanks

I bet this interesting sauce would make a great marinade for shrimp - but I didn't like it for veggies.

This is a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly but I will add more curry next time. I made it a day ahead so it was very creamy and flavorful.

The person who created this either has a ton of imagination and knowledge of what blends with what or took a chance and dumped stuff together from her refrigerator and spice shelf hoping it would taste good. Whichever is true this is one of the best dips I've made/eaten. It's wonderfully different and difficult to stop eating. It was a hit at the SuperBowl party!

Too salty! I had to dilute it with more mayo and the proportional amount of other ingredients. This brought it up to 4 stars.
