This recipe was absolute rubbish. You need a good few hours (8+) to render the fat before even thinking about making the skin crispy. An utter failure

I changed this recipe slighty - becasue I don't have a steamer - and I roasted the duck for 2 hours befoer basting it. I also added chinese plum sauce to my honey baste.
It was delicious.

Very easy compared to tradional peking duck recipes, and very tasty.  I added grated ginger and pieces of star anise into the cavity and used all the spice rub for the skin.  A notes of caution, watch duck very closely when increasing heat (especially if using a convection oven).  Didn't make the homemade plum sauce, instead heated 2 tsp. canola oil in saucepan until hot, then added 1 cup hoisin sauce (it will sizzle) and jusce of 2 limes.  Usually, peding duck is served with "pancakes" for wrapping the meat - instead, I used lettuce leaves to wrap the duck, along with basil leaves & mint, then added the sauce - fabulous!  Serve with fried rice or noodles.

This is the third time I've made this recipe, its wonderful.  I made it for a small dinner party last.  I bought two 5 pound ducks and marinated for 24 hours with a little garlic on in inside with the green onions. Also used fresh ginger. I don't have a steamer big enough so I just roast it at around 425 for 40 minutes, basting it every ten minutes, then I put on the glaze and turn the oven down to 350 for about 30 minutes glazing and basting every ten minutes then 250 till done.  When I need to crisp it I turn it to broil or 450 checking it often.  I wait until its internal temp is 165.  I serve with Wontons and rice.  Hope this wasn't confusing

this was excellent. I made the following changes I split the duck along the breast bone and layed it flat before the spice rub, refrigerated overnight.I gently pricked the skin to render most of the fat. Steamed for about 2 hours. I made 3 different dipping sauces, the plum in the recipe, orange sauce made with orange marmalade, and a sweet and sour sauce. The duck was juicy with a nice crispy skin. Not a scrap was left.

My husband said this was the best duck he ever had, and he has had Peking Duck in Peking!  The roasted crust was great and the meat very succoulant.  I prefer a saltier taste, so I will add salt next time.  The steaming then roasting process was key to the tenderness of the meat, as duck is often cooked too dry.  Great recipe!

I absolutely love duck! I was so excited to see this on here. Followed exactly and it turned out wonderful. If you really like duck, I would get a little bigger duck for more servings. I used a 5lb and it was barely enough for my husband and I once you get the meat off.Very good and will make again!!

I have never made peking duck; however i tried it when friends and family came over (guinea pigs). I didn't have a steamer but I had a roasting pan with holes on top  as well as a rack that went with it on top. I poked holes in the duck with the fork after I had it sit with the spice marinade overnight. I did place green onions and a chopped garlic clove in the cavity. I placed water in the bottom of the pan and cooked with foil cover at 375 degrees in convection oven for an hour. I drained the fat and then placed it back on the rack with foil. At this point I basted it with the soy/honey every half hour. (still returned foil on top) I tried to turn up to 475 but smoking and too hot. Turned it down to 400 and continued cooking, basting with the sauce every 20 minutes. It did get a bit darker and not too fatty. I turned on broiler for about 5-10 minutes to make skin crispier. Delicious. Friend who doesn't like duck and had tried peking duck before truly enjoyed it. I doubled the sauce recipe but used plum sauce instead of jam and used mango chutney (did chop up the bigger chunks). Delicious. First time making duck. Definitely a hit. Will make again. Took approximately 2 1/2 hours to cook.

How about Peking Chicken?  I made this using chicken instead of duck. the steaming process really made for a very moist and tender chicken.  You may want to very slightly reduce the spices a little since the chicken has a milder flesh.  Overall very nice!

Easy. I substituted the chutney with Hoisin Sauce and it's more authentic that way.  Take Chinese Pancakes and place some duck meat inside.  Drizzle with Hoisin sauce. Add a sprig of green onion.  Roll the pancake.  Each person does his/her own rolling at the table before eating.   That's the traditional way of having Peking Duck.

This was a very uncomplicated recipe and everyone raved at my spectacular Thanksgiving duck! I'd never made duck for Thanksgiving so I am so glad I tried this recipe. I did not have a steamer so I placed the duck on the wire rack in a large roasting pan and added about 1/2 inch of water to the bottom, covered it with lid and "steamed" it right in the roaster. Then just turned up the heat and removed the lid to crisp the skin and baste every 30 minutes till done. It was perfect. Even my friend's little dog (who never pays much attention to me when they come over) is now my best friend after I fed her some of this duck. The meat was quite moist and juicy and not fatty at all. Oh, I did add 1 tsp. of orange extract to the basting mixture which imparted a lovely aroma to the meat. The whole thing went great with my homemade chutney and greengage plum jam sauce.

I let the duck dry out overnight hanging upside down... turned out great.  Also made pancakes to go with.. 10 ounces of flour, 8 ounces of warm water.. kneed together and let sit for 30 minutes.  Roll out into about a foot long log. Cut off 1 1/2 inch pieces.. roll into balls.. take one and dip it into sesame oil and mash two together with the oil b/w.  Roll out into the size pancake you want... put on pan medium heat no oil... skillet works best.  Wait until puffy and brown spots, peel apart.. Serve with the sauce and cilantro.. yum!

This was very good!! I made it for our Thanksgiving. I skipped the steam step and it turned out fine. I tented my duck for about 2 hours and then took off the foil for 30-45 minutes so the skin would crisp up. I used a 6lb duck so I doubled everything!! Yum.

FABULOUS... best duck ever!!!  I always make a duck as an appetizer for our Thanksgiving.   Everyone LOVED this version ... said it was the best one I'd ever made.... they were even "fighting" over the skin!!!!!  Used the modification suggested by Kateriee on 2/5/07.  this will be our new "traditional Thanksgiving duck"

this tasted fabulous. the spices were perfect, the sauce was even great. i dont like plums, but it complemented the duck perfectly. my husband was THRILLED. my ONLY complaint is that the skin did not get crispy. it browned, but was not crispy enough. if i cooked it longer, it would have burnt. i need to find a way to get rid of more of the fat, so the skin doesnt stay soggy. otherwise, based on taste, it was a 5 star recipe.

This was the first time I had ever made duck, and with my friends as the guinea pigs to test it, it was a big two thumbs up all around. 

Just a note of something I didn't notice till after the duck had cooked - steam it with the lid off, not on - which is what I had done. It still came out fine, just had a lot of water with rendered fat in it. 
For the duck sauce, I used grape jelly instead of plum, and it still was delicious and did a great job of complimenting the duck. 

Incidentally, a wise friend suggested I skim the fat from the water, and I used it to roast red skins to serve with it. I also served Japanese Green Beans (recipe also available on this site) with high approval all around.

I've been spoiled by authentic, delicious Peking duck and this is far from being right on the money. However, it is a decent substitute for making it at hone. The key to crispy skin is to crank up the oven temperature 10 minutes before the duck is done. To make sure you don't lose moisture, I highly recommend stuffing the duck with half an onion and leaving it there for the duration of the cooking.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!!  My family and all were licking our sauce laden fingers at the end.  I was unable to steam the duck but roasted it covered in foil for two hours.  I marinated it every thirty minutes as well.  I also used dark soy sauce which gave it an awesome color.  thanks for a great recipe.

I'm Chinese and thought this was a very good duck recipe, although not really comparable to the real Peking Duck.  Nonetheless we really enjoyed it for our Valentine's Day dinner!

I am Chinese and grew up eating duck frequently. I really like this recipe. The only problem is that the skin didn't turn out crispy. I would broil it for 10 minutes next time to see what happens. Otherwise, the taste is very good. Of course, nothing compares to the ducks you get in Chinatown. But unless you can afford getting one of those special Chinse roasting oven and have a whole day roasting a duck, this is the best a home oven can do.

This dish was very tasty, but next time I will use a vertical poultry roaster to get a crispier skin. I will also put in some water in the bottom of my roaster before roasting because my pan was a mess trying to clean afterward. I let the duck hang overnight in a cool room to dry. My Husband and I made this together and really enjoyed making it. I used orange marmalade with the red plum jam which was extremely good. We loved the finished look.

Yes this was excellent and considerably easier than the traditional Peking duck recipe! We cleaned the bird off, and are planning to use the remainder for fried rice or some sort of duck soup. Using flour tortillas instead of Mandarin pancakes worked pretty well :D  The one flaw I'd say is that the bird is still a little fatty. Perhaps this could be mitigated by making sure the cuts at the serving stage don't have much fat, but the yield is a bit less.   All in all, though, if you aren't so concerned with maximizing the amount of meat/skin per duck then I'd say this is a suitably acceptable substitute. I'd say be sure to go very easy on the water when steaming too.

Amazingly good duck!  Table for one please.  It was just me this weekend so I made one breast, not the whole duck.  I omitted the orange rounds and substituted pomegranate molasses for the plum jam, garlic rice wine vinegar for distilled and sweet and spicy thai sauce for the chutney. I used all the other ingredients.  I scored the fat before seasoning both sides and left it in the frig overnight.  I didn't steam it but instead seared it skin-side down until golden. I cooked it on the green onions at 375 for 10 minutes, topped with the honey mixture and roasted for 3 minutes.  It was so tender and perfectly pink in the middle.  The sauce was a really good compliment to the duck.  I ate it with smothered potatoes and onions (fried in the duck fat) and oyster sauce glazed yellow squash.

I followed the hint about roasting it at 375 degrees for two hours instead of steaming because I could not fit it in my steamer or wok (roast for two hours, then jump to the basting and 5 minute skin crisping). I made a large foil tent and placed it over the duck the entire time it was roasting and I think that really helped crisp the skin. I was skeptical that the skin would crisp at all but was pleasantly surprised. It was not crisped to the extent of real peking duck, but it was very satisfactory. I was out of cloves and nutmeg, so I added extra cinnamon to cover for it and I had no green onions, so I left those out. Oh, and instead of the plum sauce mixture I used Hoisin Sauce, which is what my chinese friend does. Still turned out marvelous, can't wait to try it with all the ingredients!

very good recipe. I actually used a roasting rack with a little less than 1/4 inch of water in the bottom, covered the duck with foil without it touching the duck. baked slow. then remove foil for color.

This was excellent! I had made duck before but it had never turned out crispy skin and delicious. I followed the direction exactly, and my whole family enjoyed the duck - every bit was eaten, even by my two teenage daughters!

I made this using chicken. Reduced the spices by half because chicken has a more delicate flavour and skipped the 'stuffing' ingredients. I also didn't make the sauce nor did I serve it with any other; I paired this with 'Colorful Fried Rice'. As for cooking, I baked it at 450F for 15 minutes to get the skin crispy and reduced it to 350F for 45 minutes to an hour.

While the flavor of this duck is very good, this is NOT how Peking duck is cooked. The skin is not nearly as crispy as it should be. Still enjoyable as it is though.

I made this recipe today with the following changes. Steamed it for half hour, did not have the parsley or orange. Roasted it for two hours. Made my own Chinese pancakes and served the duck on the pancake with sliced scallions, sliced cucumber and hoisen sauce. It was delicious and there was enough for three people with none leftover.

The steaming is key and makes it amazingly moist - the flavor was great and I'll definitely use this recipe again the next time I make duck!

Loved this recipe. Steamed 1/12 hrs. In a vented roasting pan with 3/4 in. of water on the stove top. I added 2 tea spoons of fresh minced ginger to the spice rub. I worked the rub well into the duck prior to refrigerating for 6 hrs. I am going to China Town next week and purchase a  Chinese Peking duck and I will report back to you guys after comparison of what I have prepared with this recipe. M

The biggest draw back with this dish is the involved and semi-difficult prep and cooking steps. The flavor was subtle on strength, not over powering at all, but very complicated and exotic. With fresh plum duck sauce this make a great main course for a meal.

This skin didn't turn out as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was excellent.  I'll probably need to work on rendering the fat better.

This recipe made a duck with a nice flavor reminiscent of Peking Duck though much milder.  The skin, for the most part, did not get very crispy.  I turned on the broiler afterward, and it helped caramelize the skin a bit, giving it some color and more crispiness.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loved it. I don't have a steamer, so I put the duck in a double pan (water in the bottom pan and the duck on the holed top pan). I covered the duck with foil and put in the oven at 375 degrees for about an hour. Then I removed the foil and let the duck brown (both sides) at 425 degrees. The skin wasn't crispy (it was charring so I took it out of the oven) but the meat was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

While I'm not a big duck fan, my spouse is. She and her girlfriends devoured this duck and loved it! I cooked it exactly as given in the recipe. The plum sauce went over big, also. If you like duck you will love this recipe.

My recipe is similar... I baste the duck while cooking with a mixture of thawed raspberries and honey.  It  browns nicely
and gives a sweet flavor to the skin which my husband loves.

Wonderful!  I didn't cut off the tail but kept it on. Flavorful and moist. I used the liver and giblets in a stuffing-dressing side dish.  After serving it for Christmas dinner I made broth from the carcass. I chopped up the leftover bones and skin, and simmered for a few hours with a star anise, celery and onions. Then strained the solids, and put in fridge so fat is easier skim off. Used the broth for Raman soups and freezed some for later!

This is quite a bit of trouble to make, but I was very happy how it turned out. My wife liked it as well.
One substitution.... I could not find plum preserves, so I used peach for the duck sauce instead. I thought I had made too much, and when tasted in the dish I mixed it in I thought it was so so. When dipping the duck in it, and with the garnish flavors mixed it, it was great. Wish I had made more of it.

I just did this recipe as my first duck - actually I did two ducks at the same time since I had 5 adults and two kids to make happy. 

Overall the recipe is clear and my guests all enjoyed it.  I matched it with the "Mandarin Pancakes" recipe on this site by Rhonda Parkinson with green onions and a variety of sauces (yum)

One comment is the my ducks' internal temperatures were slightly higher than ideal when I finished crimping the skins.  I think the reason why was because I used the "convection roast" feature on my oven and forgot that cooks faster.  I'm going to try again soon and use regular roast setting.

I used duck that was shot down in the wild. And I skipped the steam part of the instructions and it still turned out delicious.   Oh, and apparently chutney is hard to find at my supermarkets (Safeway). So I made the plum sauce without it, and it still made the dish delicious.   Anywho, thanks for the recipe!

It was my first time roasting duck, hence all the mistakes, and of course, not clearly reading the directions.  I combined all the ingredient together, except, the sauce ingredients. I marinated the duck in the mixture overnight.  Baked it for 2 hours.  The skin came up dark, but boy, was it ever tasty even with the sauce!

It was nice and crispy on the outside and tender and moist inside.  For being dark meat I was surprised!
I followed the recipe pretty close and I would make it again!

I did not use the plum jam sauce, used fruit chili sauce as a side dish. 
My family loved it, and I liked that the work was done in stages making it seem very easy to do.
For steaming I use our Ninja cooking system that has the steaming basket.

First time making duck and I am surprisingly happy with the outcome. This was much better than the family expected it to be and the flavor was delicious.  I was able to allow it to marinate for about 4 hours and the only thing that I did different was use whole allspice in place of the cloves. 
I really wanted to give this 5 stars however, my only complaint is that the method of marinating the duck does not allow the flavors to penetrate the meat. Next time I will leave it overnight in a brine and pull back skin to massage the mixture into the meat. Fool proof way to make sure all that flavor is in there but this is definitely being added to the arsenal.  
Photo=remainder after first attack.  I'll try to remember to take photos first.

My husband brought home 7 ducks from his cousins’ farm.  I was quite intimidated because had never cooked duck before or even eaten it outside a restaurant. This recipe was a lifesaver. Everybody devoured the duck. Delicious - thanks for posting.

Followed all directions but couldn't find plum jam. Substituted apple jelly instead and it was great. Will make this again soon.

This recipe worked very well. It is simple and doable. I have eaten Perking Duck in Beijing a few times. This was not "the real deal" but it was a very good dish overall.

Wonderful. Have made twice. Added some orange zest on the run and some ginger to the steamy water this time.  Took me longer to cook last time so did the finish 500 degree crisp with the roasting pan in the gas BBQ. Plus the smoke alarm didn't go off! Thank you for the recipe. :)

My hubby and I will cook this Duck Recipe many more times!  We put 1/2 an orange with the green onion in the cavity and also trussed the bird.  We did not remove the items in the cavity until the cooking process was fully done.  Oh, we doubled the rub spices and soy.  AMAZING!!!

I had doubt before I made this because I like peking duck but I can't imagine cinnamon and nutmeg to marinate. Ended up we all love this duck. One mistake I made was I didn't brush the honey and soy sauce all over the duck. That add a very good finish to the duck. And I need to get a bigger duck too.

So good. I made this for Christmas. This is the first time I made duck. I had it once along time ago at a restaurant and loved it. This was pretty close to what I remembered. I of course did not have a steamer so I baked it for 2 hours. I also couldn't find the chuntey 2 days before Christmas so I left it out. I still loved the sauce. I bought 2 ducks before Christmas and only cooked one so I will be using this recipe to make the other duck later.

This was beautiful!  No modifications were necessary.  The Meat was tender and juicy, not greasy.  The skin came out light and crispy.  Definitely a go-to for Duck!

when i made peking duck some 35 years ago, i dipped the whole duck into boiling water, then tied it so that the fat would easily get out of the bird... needless to say, did it several  times.  the finished product was unbeliveably crispy and sooooo tasty!!!

I've never had peking duck made the traditional way so I can't say how it compares to the original but this super-quick and easy version makes a crispy duck and a scrumptous spicy fruit glaze and is a really delicious recipe!!!

This was delicious. I didn't have time to make the plum dipping sauce and the duck was tasty without it. But I wish I had planned better and made the sauce while the duck was steaming instead of waiting until the last minute.
