Great recipe- great muffins! I modified mine a little- instead of the applesauce, I used 1 large mashed banana, and instead of the brown sugar, I used 1/4 cup honey. Also, I used 1 cup w.w. flour and no white flour. They turned out great, not too sweet but definitely sweet enough. I also calculated a nutrition fact chart for my version..

With a few minor adjustments these muffins can really be five stars! I made two batches to compare and here are a few suggestions: use wheat bran, all bran doesnt give it the same consistency or flavor, add a little bit of cinnamon, add a little baking powder NOT baking soda (and make sure to sift both), beating the egg whites before adding them in gives the muffins a little extra lightness that is necessary. Add as many blueberries or fruit of choice that you want, they make them extra delecious!

I agree with alot of the others comments. These are my substitutions: 
All Bran cereal for wheat bran
1/2 cup brown sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar (just depends how sweet you like them, just fine with 1/2 cup)
1 1/4 tsp baking powder for 1 tsp bp
1 1/4 tsp baking soda for 1 tsp bp
1 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup wheat 1/2 cup white. These are keepers will make again and again.

This recipe is terrific: almost too good to be true, it tastes moist, sweet, and delicious like a fresh muffin should. With minor changes I sell these muffins in my espresso bar to patrons looking for a slightly healthier treat with their java. Fun alterations I have made include substituting a cup of grated tart apple or pear for the berries, using dried blueberries instead of fresh, and adding cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Also if you like nonfat yogurt can stand in for the applesauce. I highly recommend this recipe for a healthy breakfast treat.

My 6 year old daughter and I made these this morning.  We are really watching our food choices, and that's why we chose this recipe.  Everyone loved them.  They came right out of greased muffin tins.  I wouldn't use paper liners, as these are somewhat sticky.  I made only a couple of changes... used all whole wheat flour (HINT: get some wheat gluten from the store.  It will help prevent HEAVINESS from the wheat flour and you will not need to increase the baking powder or soda.  You can find it either in the baking aisle or the health food aisle.  Use about 2 tsp. for this recipe).  We added about 1/2 cup of finely grated carrot for fiber and sweetness, upped the vanilla to 1 tsp., and added about 1/4 cup of Splenda just in case the frozen blueberries (use them frozen) weren't at the peak of sweetness.  Oh yeah, we used All-Bran cereal soaked in the milk instead of wheat bran.  Anyway.... try these- they are wonderful.  Would definitely make them again.  Thank you for the recipe!

A very good and very healthy muffin recipe. As other reviewers did, I substituted oat bran for wheat bran. I also added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, doubled the amount of blueberries, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and used Egg Beaters instead of the egg. I kept the 1/2 cup of white flour (instead of subbing wheat flour to make it even healthier), and I'm glad I did, because it helped keep the muffins a little bit fluffier/less dense, while only detracting a small bit from the overall nutrition of the muffins. A definite winner -- yum!

I couldn't be more pleased with the way this recipe turned out. This muffins did not taste low-fat at all. Instead of using just blueberries, I used frozed berry medly that comes in a bag (blueberrries, respberries, blackberries, and strawberries.) I had to cut up the berries a little, but it worked great. Had kind of a cobbler taste to it. Will definitely make again.

I made these the other night and was so impressed! They were even better than regular muffins! I used 1 cup of whole wheat instead of half of white and half of whole wheat, egg substitute (about 50ml), and 1 cup of frozen cranberries. Awesome.

These muffins are great!  We simply love them.  My wife is on weight watchers, these work out to 1 point each!  She eats two every day!  We have also subbed out the blueberries for very finely chopped apples, and added cinnamon.  A sprinkle of quick oats on top, and a bake, and you have GREAT low fat, low calorie, high fibre muffins.  These are delicious, and so very good for you.  We both eat them daily, my wife has lost 40lbs. and I have lost 30lbs.   Fantastic recipe!

Excellent recipe, will definitely make again and again. Best bran muffins I've ever made or eaten. Very moist and fluffy - not dense and heavy, as they often are. Made a couple of modifications: based on other reviews I increased baking powder to 1.5 tsp, and for my personal taste, I used 1 c. bran and 1/2 c. oats (quick, not instant). Also used dark brown sugar, so they came out a lovely bran muffin color. Used frozen blueberries, and tossed them in a teaspoon of the flour from the dry ingredients, and got no bleeding or streaking.

We used All-Bran cereal in place of the wheat bran, added a little extra vanilla extract and increased the cooking time to 25 minutes (for my European oven). If you like your muffins a little on the larger side, the cups can be filled near to the top. Oh, and be careful to not slam the oven door while they are baking or else they might sag a little... :) Very good! Moist and satisfying! The blueberries add just the right amount of tart flavor to the muffin, but be sure to fold them in as evenly as you can so they are distributed equally throughout.

Ok, I followed the recipe and no matter how long I baked them they were raw in the middle. I tasted the outside and that was also bland. This was a complete waste of ingrediences. One star is only because I made them with my daugther and we like to bake together.

These are a no-guilt treat that has texture like no other muffin. They were very moist,  I made my own apple sauce 1 apple=1/2 cup of apple sauce. I just put the apple in the food processor added a little water and the consistency was superb! The extra water from the fresh apple sauce added to the fluffy texture. Overall very refreshing, reminding me of spring!

These are very yummy and filling.  I did make one change and that is that I cut the wheat bran to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of steel cut oats.  If you like crunchy stuff, you might like this change.  It ups the protein count and creates a very hearty, but sweet and moist muffin.

I really liked these.  I also like morning glory muffins, but the calories are outrageous, so I used this recipe as a base and instead of 1 cup of blueberries, I added 1/4 cup crushed pineapple, 1/4 crasins, 1/4 shredded carrots and 1/4 c cherries, plus a sprinkle of cinnamon.  They were awesome.  This recipe is good enough you could probably add 1 cup of any combination of fruits and/or veggies and they would be good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Based on suggestions from fellow reviewers I made the following changes:  1/2 cup yoghurt for applesauce, 1 1/2 cups oatbran for wheat bran, 3 TBSP & 2tsp egg creations for 1 large egg, raspberries for blueberries and used 2 cups instead of 1.  I also added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten and added 1/4 flax meal.  Used muffin top pans and mini muffin tins for remainder of batter.  Absolutely to die for.  Didn't taste "healthy" like some recipes that are awful.  The vital wheat gluten made the muffins rise and less dense.

This is a great recipe just as is! However, it is also extremely versatile. I've made a number of variations on it over time, and it always comes out well. Using mashed banana instead of applesauce gives it extra flavor as well as natural sweetness; grated carrot and apple juice is also nice; replacing half the flour with instant oats works, too; adding cinnamon gives it some warmth. Oh, and I've also replaced the brown sugar with agave nectar or honey -it's great! (about 1/2 cup) In short, by keeping the same dry to wet ratio, the sky's the limit with this recipe!

Pretty good.  I substituted vanilla yogurt for the applesauce and vanilla.  The batter was too thin and the muffins took about 22 minutes to cook.  I did like the idea of using bran in the recipe.

These were really tasty!  The only quarrel I have with them (and the reason I only gave them 4 stars) is they don't rise very well.  You can't even tell they're low-fat!

The most difficult part of this recipe was locating the wheat bran in my grocery store. The muffins turned out excellent.  Moist and dense.  I will make sure my blueberries are firm next time as these berries were just a bit soft.  I suppose compared to a highly processed muffin these may not seem sweet, but I thought they had just the perfect sweetness level.  Blueberries are such a power food, and when combined with the fiber of this recipe....Perfect!

Please try this!  I used other cooks' suggestions, and used All-Bran in place of wheat bran, all whole-wheat flour, the additional 1/4 tsp. each of soda and baking powder. and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I used 2 ripe bananas, mashed, in place of the applesauce.  Bake for at least 20 minutes, especially if you are using frozen blueberries. This is definitely a keeper!  My family loved them.  You will not realize they are low-fat.

Growing up, my mom always would put a teaspoon or two of Fry's cocoa into bran muffin batter. So, I did too. I didn't have fresh blueberries on hand, so i used frozen ones. Mine were organic, so they were small like wild blueberries. I liked this though; there was blueberry flavour in every bite! These were really great muffins. My two year old loved them too. I will definately be making these again.

I substituted regular Splenda for the bown sugar and added an extra 1/3-2/3 cup of powdered milk to the dry ingredients.  Marvelous and sugar free.

LOVED these!  I used All Bran cereal for the wheat bran, and all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour (slightly less healthy, but I like them springier, less dense).  And used frozen blueberries, so definitely baked at least 20 minutes, maybe a little longer. Only problem is I had trouble getting them out of the paper - may try cooking spray in a silicon muffin pan next time.

This is the second time I've made these muffins and I just love them! As with others, I've made a few modifications- decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp cinnamon for more flavor, and also added 1 cup raspberries. The double berries make them SO decadent, and because there is no fat in the muffins, I don't feel a bit guilty about topping some nice warm muffins with butter and enjoying them with my morning coffee. This recipe is so perfect-you can freeze them to have leftovers for mornings where you are on the go and in a rush. Wonderful recipe!

These muffins were excellent! Moist AND low-fat?!?! Too good to be true! I made these alterations: 1/4 c. honey instead of sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 c. cake flour instead of white flour (impromptu substitution when I realized my white flour was infested with ants, ew!). Another thing I did differently was I left out the blueberries and divided the batter evenly among mini-muffin pans. Then I stirred in various add-ins (raisins, dried cranberries and orange peel, banana, sunflower seeds, blackberries, chocolate chips and coconut, anything else I could find) to each muffin so I had many different flavors! The mini-muffins took about 6 minutes to cook. FUN!

These muffins are fabulous!  They are very moist and flavoful.  I used frozen mixed berries instead of blueberries and substituted the 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour for one whole cup of whole wheat flour and the muffins turned out perfectly!  I will be making these on a regular basis!

First time healthy food eater, long time blueberry enthusiast - devoured these super moist muffins in one night. I followed the ingredients exactly with the exception of adding some cinnamon and roughly 2x - 2.5x the amount of blueberries. These will be my go-to breakfast before work each morning.

Let me just start by saying how much I normally hate bran muffins.   Store bought bran muffins are painfully dry and bland and all regular muffins are just unfrosted cupcakes.   With all the great reviews, I was motivated to make these right away and I'm so glad I did.   THEY ARE FANTASTIC!!!      These have healthy wholesome ingredients and the texture is dreamy.     They don't rise much (as shown in the photo), so fill them all the way to the top of the muffin cup.   They do pop right out no problem if you spray with Pam.    Hearty and delicious!   I will be making these many many times with whatever fruit is in the house.

I had the same problem others have had with the muffins not cooking on the inside... If anybody knows why this is happening, I'd love to know. I just kept putting them back in for longer and I finally had to give up because they were starting to burn on the outside, but were still raw on the inside. I followed the directions exactly, except for substituting flaxseed meal for the egg. Can't imagine that causing this problem. All in all, I was very disappointed.

Fantastic! Works well with all whole wheat four in place of the all-purpose, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Moist and delicious.

This was quite a good bran muffin recipe.  Like a lot of the other reviewers, I tweaked this recipe substituting pureed strawberries for the applesauce and finely chopped strawberries for the blueberries.  No, it doesn't taste like like a fluffy regular muffin but it tastes as good as any bran muffin I have gotten in a bakery.  It was hearty, but still very moist and light.  I look forward to making this again with whatever berries or other ingredients I have on hand.  Great recipe.

Great taste & the colour was nicely golden! I only used white flour & added my own crumble topping (using oats, flour, sugar and butter), a little twist on this lovely recipe :)

I subbed splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar, subbed a 1/2 cup wheat germ for 1/2 cup wheat bran to make even more healthy. These are awesome, will be making again for sure.

These were great! We liked them a lot. My only criticism is that we are at high altitude so they didn't puff up like a muffin normally would. I think next time I need to add some extra baking powder.

This recipe is great!  I used more vanilla, as other reviewers suggested (I used a full teaspoon).  My family LOVES them!  In addition to making them with blueberries, I tried modifying the recipe as follows:  I substituted 1/2 cup canned pumpkin for the applesauce, added one cup chopped apples instead of the blueberries, added 1/2 tablespoon of water (because the pumpkin was a little less moist than applesauce), added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  SUPER YUMMY!!!!!

I thought these were great for being so healthy! I used 1 cup of whole grain flour instead of the whole wheat and all purpose. They still were fluffy. Plus I used frozen raspberries and blueberries for some variety.

I made a double batch to give some away. I added some flax and millet to give a little extra crunch and used egg whites to lower calories, but changed nothing to alter flavor. Super healthy and yummy warm with a little butter. Will definitely make again.

Followed the other reviewers and loved the results! Added 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and 1/3 c. dry roasted almonds. Increased baking powder and baking soda by 1/4 teaspoon each. Substituted 1 mashed banana for the applesauce, and substituted a "flax egg" (1 T. flax seed + 3 T. boiling water, let sit for 10 minutes) for the real egg. Truly a five-star recipes!

These are fabulous!! They get tastier after they cool off!

Changes I made include:
1. Used fresh raspberries instead (slightly mashed before adding to mix)
2. Didnt have applesuace, used 1/3 cup of oil instead
3. Added nutmeg and cinnamon to flour mixture
4. Didnt have whole wheat flour, so I used all purpose flour instead
5. I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top of each muffin prior to baking
6. I used 1 cup of bran cereal and 1/2 cup of oatmeal
7. Added extra 1/2 cup of milk for soaking the bran as I felt it wasnt moist enough (probably not nessecary)

Enjoy!!!

I made them per the recipe and thought they were ok.  They stick somewhat to the paper liners so next time I'll just spray the muffin pan and skip the liners.  If the blueberries you have aren't sweet you may want to consider adding additional sugar or another sweet fruit to the mix as there isn't much sweetness in the recipe itself and it needs some kind of sweetener.  The blueberries I used were somewhat tart and left the muffins tasting the same.

I used oat bran instead of wheat bran because I couldn't find it at my store. Also substituted Splenda brown sugar for the sugar, but otherwise made as directed. They puffed up nicely. I had no trouble with doneness. Tasted good and just sweet enough. Chewy, but in a good way. (maybe it was the oat bran?)

Not the same as regular muffins, by far.  They were way to grainy. I love whole grains, but this was overkill.  I even added streusel on top and it just wasn't tasty.  I may try to find a recipe without wheat bran...or at least less.

Fantastic recipe base - I made a few changes.  
I used bran flakes and increased to 2 cups, one large ripe banana mashed instead of the apple sauce, 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, all whole wheat flour - no white, and 2 cups of fruit. AWESOME!  Plenty sweet and lots of wonderful flavor and very moist.  One of my new favs!

Thanks for sharing this healthy muffin recipe! It's nice and moist, yet low fat and high fiber. Nice. Be realistic: this is a low-fat recipe so it's not the taste sensation you might get with other popular blueberry muffin recipes (eg the ones with sugar toppings etc), but it's a good choice if you like wholesome ingredients and are watching your weight.

These muffins are the answer to a weight watchers prayer!  You could have 2 or 3 of these for the same calories as 1 from the bakery!  I substituted fresh cranberries for blueberries, doubled the vanilla and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  These muffins are big and beautiful - don't use cupcake papers - just spray your pans.  Delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!

These are AMAZING!!! The recipe and method of preparation is very similar to Classic Bran Muffins from this site. I used a mashed banana instead of applesauce and chopped apples instead of blueberries. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and they were still plenty sweet. They were also gone within about 12 hours...probably my favorite muffins EVER. Next time I'll make the batter into six giant muffins instead of twelve little ones.

I made these last night following the recipe exactly.  They came out fantastic.  I've never liked bran muffins but I want to try eating better.  These muffins by no means taste as if they are low fat.  My kids, even my picky eater, had 1 for dessert last night, 2 for breakfast and took another for snack time at school.  My advice:  double the recipe or they'll be gone in a flash!

This recipe is amazing!  I had a craving for a moist bran muffin but most recipes had way too much oil or butter.  I did make a few changes and they worked fine.  I switched the amounts of applesauce and milk, using 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and just 1/2 cup of milk.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup which was still too sweet for me.  I will reduce it to 1/4 cup next time.  I didn't have blueberries so I just left them out since I had already increased the applesauce.  I got 12 nice sized muffins for about 100 calories apiece.  I will definitely make this again.  These were wonderful!

I can't count how many times I've made these!  I've made them with blueberries, raspberries (our fave), raisins...all delicious.  The only thing I change is the flour- all whole wheat or 3/4 whole wheat and 1/4 9-grain blend.  Thanks for sharing this perfect healthy snack!

I have made these muffins many times and they are fabulous.Very versatile recipe as you can make many substitutions and they still turn out great. I have used non-fat yogurt for oil, honey for sweetness, and 1/4 cup wheat germ. It is a very moist muffin so it last longer if refridgerated.I have substituted apples, cranberries,nuts, but blueberries are the best.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little cinnamon.  They are quite sweet - I will probably cut the sugar down to maybe 1.5 cups next time.  My kids loved them.

I liked these muffins, but I didn't follow the recipe completely,
partly because I didn't have some of the ingredients, and one bit because
I thought it add flavor (the buttermilk).  
The result was great, people loved 'em.

My substitutions:
Flour: Used 1 cup of King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour (instead of 1/2 + 1/2 regular/WW).
Bran: Used instead 1 cup of wheat germ + 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed meal.
Milk: Replaced nonfat with buttermilk (1 cup).

Don't know how different the result is, but it's sure good!

Excellent as presented. I may do some of the suggested substitutions later but, for now, I'll stick to this. The only problem I had was baking in paper cups. A lot of the muffin sticks to the paper. Next time, I'll just put the batter straight into the muffin tin.

These turned out moist and delicious.  I used nonfat greek yogurt instead of applesauce, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp ground allspice and 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup splenda baking sugar, 2 cups frozen blueberries. They were about 107 calories and yummmmy.

These muffins have become my breakfast staple.  I have 3 every day for breakfast, and at about 100 calories each, are an awesome healthy breakfast.  Plus they go great with coffee.  And the recipe lends itself well to playing around with ingredients.  I now use 100% whole wheat flour instead of half whole wheat and half AP flour.  And I dropped the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup, which to me is a perfect sweetness.  And I add 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Plus I sometimes add 2 TBL of flax seed or wheat germ, depending on how I feel.  Outstanding!

I followed the recipe and the muffins turned out just okay.  The second time I used 4 very ripe bananas, no blueberries, and 1/3 c brown sugar.  I really enjoyed the muffins and will make it again using bananas.

OMG soo good!!
I used 1/4c egg whites rather than an egg,
used mashed banana and topped up with apple sauce to reach 1/2 c, and I used all whole wheat flour. 
I beat the egg whites seperately to give the recipe a light fluffy texture... odd for bran muffins I know! lol

I am really enjoying these!! a real treat... that doesnt break the diet... now to only have 1!! :)

Excellent recipe even though I tweaked it quite a bit. Didn't have wheat bran so substituted with wheat germ, pumpernickel flour & oats. Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar but think that the 2/3 would have been just fine. Used fieldberrry applesauce instead of just regular apple. Maybe a 1 1/4 of mixed frozen fieldberries instead of just blueberries. Overall, nice texture and moist.

These did turn out very sweet and moist, and even my husband liked them.  However, they tasted more like bran muffins and did not have a strong blueberry flavor, despite the fact that I threw in some extra blueberries (I sued half fresh, half frozen blueberries).  For the wheat bran, I used bran flake cereal, crushed fine, but otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I have blueberry muffin recipes that I prefer, but I would make these if I were looking for a lighter alternative.

Made them just like the recipe (other than using 1% milk) and they were YUMMY! Fresh blueberries made them great and the muffins are sweet and moist. Thank you for this great and healthy breakfast option- so easy to grab on my way out the door and satisfying too!

Yum. Being so low in fat I was able to add my favorite struesal topping. A simple mixture of a couple TB's of butter and some flour, sugar and oatmeal. Sprinkle on top and bake as directed! Yum.I am a muffin lover and love the fact that I can eat these guilt-free!

These were delicious. Frozen blueberry's worked perfectly fine for me. I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and I'm glad I did. For starters I don't like overly sweet pastries but I also substituted in vanilla soy milk ( all I had) , forgetting that it has sugar in it already. This half way filled 3 small mini loaf pans so I would def double next time. I had an extreme amount of topping left over so I will save it in the fridge for next time ( and there will be a next time!!)

These muffins turned out wonderfully in both shape and taste.  I was worried that they might fall flat in the oven but they popped up a fair bit at the top so I was quite relieved when I took them out.  They also tasted very healthy and delicious.  Not at all oily or heavy like muffins that call for vegetable oil, butter, or margarine.  I only made 2 changes to the recipe: I cut the sugar back to 1/2 a cup (and it still tasted fine), and I replaced the wheat flour (which I didn't have) with oats.  Will definitely  be making this often!

Thanks for sharing!  I made these and followed the recipe to the "t" and honestly these are perfect for a hearty grab n go breakfast.   Pros: Healthy and a great grab and go breakfast or even a great snack in the afternoon with some coffee. These were dense muffins and really tasted great and filled you up.  Cons: A little on the squishy side. I think it might be too much applesauce. They came out very sticky and a little mushy on the inside.   Next time I might cut back on the applesauce a tad or try a banana like some have suggested instead.   Overall, I am definitely making these again :)  perhaps, right now! :D

I am not a very experienced "baker"; so was a bit apprehensive in even making muffins.  Am thankful for the wonderful tips from other reviewers and for the original recipe being posted as well.  These muffins are delicious.  They are very moist and have a wonderful texture from the wheat bran.  The only thing I added was some ground flax to pack an even healthier punch!

EEK, NO EGGS! I've been using this recipe for a couple months now and love it! It's super easy to tweak if I want a change. I realized today (of course, after I started mixing ingredients) that I didn't have any eggs so I substituted them with 1 heaping tablespoon of ground flax seed and 3 tablespoons of water blended together. They came out PERFECT! In fact, they came out better than usual. Don't you love it when accidents result in a healthier alternative?

I thought these muffins were bland. It was nice that they are healthy, but I have made other muffins that were good for me and tasted better.

These are a wonderful, moist muffin. Good enough, really, to make a bran muffin hater eat the whole lot. This recipe is super quick and easy-I whip them up while coffee brews in the morning for guests and they have them fresh out of the oven. They are so moist that you won't even miss your regular pat of butter, I promise! Now I should mention that I have tinkered with the recipe a bit, minor variations really. I add about a half a cup of ground flax seed in with the flours. It adds a little fat, but its the healthy kind, and I don't feel it changes the flavour or consistency of the muffin at all. I have also made these with both fresh and frozen fruit with equally good results. A small package of frozen mixed blue/black/raspberries is awesome as well as plain raspberries or a pint of fresh blueberries if you can find them. I also might add that I use the individual sugar-free Motts cups of sauce in leiu of scooping out of a bigger jar, as our family doesn't use apple sauce often and the leftovers would go to waste. One single cup is the perfect amount for this recipe and you can even experiment with different (apple/cinnamon, mago/peach etc) varieties to add a little something.

I LOVE these muffins! I've made these twice now and they are soooo good! Both times I've used wheat germ instead of bran because that's all I had and it was fantastic. I will try using bran next time but I don't see how it could be any better.

These were great - delicious and good for you! I made some substitutions since I'm a student and don't have much in the house.  A mashed banana for the applesauce, 1/3 cup honey for the sugar, and some cranberries and chunks of pears in place of the blueberries.  I also grated up a carrot and added a pinch of cinnamon!  My only complaint is that they really didn't rise very much - any suggestions? I don't know whether to add more/less baking soda or banking powder.

I loved this recipe!  Moist, delicious, and best of all, healthy!  I put in all whole wheat flour instead of half white flour and the taste was still great-not to mention much more nutritious.  I also added some wheat germ to boost the nutrition.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have any applesauce so I used some peach sauce. I think that any pureed fruit would probably work just fine.

Let's not kid ourselves, these muffins definitely do not taste like the rich, cakey-full-fat-white flour blueberry muffins you can buy at the local bakery but, for a much healthier alternative, these were delicious! My husband and I both loved them and plan to make them again next week.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I are in the process of renovating our eating habits and being more healthy, and this recipe will definitely be a standby.  I made it exactly as written, and the muffins came out fantastic.  My husband agreed, saying "I was a little worried at first...brown muffins scare me!"  We both loved these muffins, and they are chock full of good things.  I think this recipe would be easily adaptable to other fruits and seasonings as well.  I bet you could use chopped banana or apples, frozen raspberries, or dried fruits like raisins or apricots instead of the blueberries with excellent results.  The recipe also seems like it would be a good base for shredded carrots, crushed pineapple (drained), nuts, and seasonings to make a carrot spice muffin.  I plan on trying as many variations as I can think of!  Thanks for such a great-tasting AND healthy recipe.  :-)

These are the best low fat muffins I've made. It's so hard to believe they are low calorie and only have 1 gr. of fat! They're so full of flavor. I made a few adjustments. I used 1/3 c. each of brown sugar and Splenda with 1 TBS molasses. I only had all purpose flour so I used that. I used about 1 1/4 c. of frozen blueberries. I'll be making these again. Thank you!

made it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of skim milk and used splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar.  added 2 tsp vital wheat gluten, used all whole wheat flour and used almost a pint of fresh blueberries.  it is very healthy low-calorie and moist from the blueberries and applesauce.  only reason that I did not give it a 5 star--in presentation it is not as beautiful as a blueberry muffin made with white flour and no bran.

These are very good.  I accidentally doubled the amount of applesauce, they were really moist!  Not a bad mistake at all.  I might do it that way again!  I also added cinnamon, really yum!

I made these with the following changes: Instead of brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup raw honey. I increased the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and left out the regular flour. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and used frozen wild blueberries. They were a little bland. Knowing how healthy they are, I'm OK with eating them and I'm sure I'll make them again, but I'll make other changes. I might increase the honey to 1/2 cup and do the 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour. I think I'd like them better with more cinnamon, too. I might try 1/2 tsp. Very easy to make.

Had a little problem with the baking.. Never have this problem before and i bake often. i was a little perplex. It was raw in the middle when it's supposed to be done. Had to bake them a little longer till it looked a little burnt. Too much bran and blueberries for me. Lucky for me, I had halved the recipe. Don't think it's a keeper for me. Nevertheless, Ty for sharing :)

OUTSTANDING!!!  Moist... satisfying... WOW!  Don't change a thing expect I like loads of fruit so I added 1.5 cups of berries (half blueberries, half whole cranberries)  It's become a staple for myself and my college daughter as a healthy, satisfying delicious breakfast on the go.  Totally complete!

These muffins were great.  I did the recipe as is with the exception of using Eggbeaters instead of egg, and I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts for some added texture/crunch.  These were a hearty and healthy snack.  We'll make these again.  Thanks!

Made these and instead of Wheat Bran I used Flax Seed Meal. Instead of Brown Sugar I used 16 Packets of Splenda (I was desperate). I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour to substitute the white flour. I must say I've been looking for a low-carb muffin and these were super delicious. I cooked them for about 20-23 minutes. Perfect for a Breakfast on the go! My only issue with this recipe was that the center was a bit mushy but the muffin itself was very moist. If anyone has a tip on how to get rid of the "mush", let me know. :-)

Excellent! Used frozen berries. I had oat bran instead of wheat bran, added in a bit more baking powder/baking soda, the cinnamon suggested, egg white instead of egg, 2/3 c applesauce.  This made 18 muffins.  I baked at 350 for 23 minutes (my oven runs a little hot) and they came out moist, chewy, delish. The only downside is the frozen berries bled into the batter turning it bluish, but who cares?

This was so good! I changed it a bit after looking at reviews, but not too much. I just added extra baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, a bit of ginger, and a bit of honey. And I used one ripe banana and a bit of applesauce (used a bit more than 1/2 cup). So yummy!

These were really good! I took another reviewers suggestion and used 1/4 cup of honey instead of the brown sugar. I also used a banana instead of the applesauce. I only had a cup of the wheat bran so I added 1/4 cup each wheat germ and oat bran. The second time I made these I added chopped pecans. So yummy. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have any dried blueberries on hand, so I used raisins.  Awesome!  Next time I am at the store I'll be sure to buy dried blueberries, because that may be even better.

yummy and fluffy. I used 1/4 c honey instead of sugar and then sprinkled a little sugar on top of each. I also did 1 1/4 t baking powder with no baking soda. Next time I'll add a touch of cinnamon and some flax meal.

These are the best muffins - ever. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of white flour, Splenda brown sugar and added chopped walnuts. The pictures shows the muffins that were left, after my husband ate the rest before the picture was taken. Love the square muffin tin.

These are awesome!  My  husband said they were the best I had ever made.  I did substitute egg replacer for the egg and used a non-dairy milk substitute for the milk due to allergies in the family.  The result was fabulous!  My 5 year old gobbled them up.

I was making these for their digestive, not their weight-loss, benefits, so I subbed vegetable oil for the applesauce, 2% milk for the nonfat, and regular white for the whole-wheat flour, in an effort to make them taste more like normal blueberry muffins.   The texture came out great, but I found the final muffins to be a little bland and bitter compared to the non-bran muffins I'm used to.  Were I to make these again, I'd definitely increase the sugar to 3/4 cup, and possibly do half-and-half white and brown sugar instead of all brown.

Tasty! I did add about 2 T wheat germ and used all whole wheat flour. Added 1 tsp ground cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp each of ginger and nutmeg. Didn't have blueberries, but I really didn't miss them. After baking, I poked holes on the top of the muffins with a fork and very lightly drizzled them with honey. Delicious! tasted like these honey bran muffins I get at a chain restaurant except these are MUCH healthier. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was excellent.  I was skeptical at first, because in my experience 'low fat' means dry and bland.  These came out moist and tasted great!

This was probably the most moist bran muffin recipe I've tried. Not too sweet and perfect for breakfast. I made a batch with raspberries and one with blueberries. Raspberries were my fav. Note: used 1/2 cup no-fat greek yogourt instead of apple sauce (that was all I had) and used 1.5 tsp of baking powder instead of the powder and the soda.

These are moist and very tasty. I made the following changes. I used vanilla soymilk in place of the nonfat milk,  mashed banana in place of the applesauce, honey in place of brown sugar, whole wheat pastry flour in place of whole wheat and white flour, added an extra egg white, ommited the baking soda and salt, increased the baking powder and added cinnamon. Even I could not resist and ate three the day I made them!

Health...yes. Taste good.....not really. But ya know, the kids ate em and didn't fuss about 'em. I did substitute the 1/2 C of apple sauce with rhubarb sauce. I thought this maybe caused the batter to be thin, but after reading some of the review, I don't think this changed the batter consistancy. Though I didn't care much for these muffins, it was a nice way to use my left over bran flakes and rhubarb sauce. I give it a 2 star since the kids liked 'em. :)

I followed the recipe exactly as written, with of course one exception.  I heapped the cup of blueberries and added 1/2 cup of raspberries.  My husband and I love them.  I agree just as delicious and moist as regular muffins.

These are alright for a very low calorie treat.  Almost identical to Clasic bran Muffins, which I prefer by far, though they have a bit more fat in them-they are still very healthy and I find the difference worth the very few added calories.

If my boyfriend is any indication, these should get more than five stars.  He devoured four of them ten minutes after they came out of the oven.  A week later, when I told him I'd make him some more if he'd go to the store to buy me fresh blueberries, he came back with five little packages.  When I told him I didn't need that much, he replied, "You can make double batches, can't you???"  Uh, ok.  Sure.

They came out delicious.  The blueberries explode in your mouth, so I suggest fresh ones.  The second time I made them I used oat bran because my boyfriend couldn't find wheat bran.  We preferred those but we wonder if oat bran has less fiber than wheat.  We'd want the fiber and they're still delicious with wheat bran.

I made these at least twice a month if not more. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries. Husband loves them for a morning treat.

I love these!  Did make a couple of alterations to the recipe.  Used 1/2 cup of wheat bran, 1 cup each of whole wheat flour and white flour.  Used Splenda brown sugar blend according to the package directions.  They're FANTASTIC!  And only 3 Points Plus for Weight Watchers each!  A couple of sprays of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray, and it's a great snack.

These are excellent!  I didn't have applesauce on hand the first time, so I used 1/3 cup oil instead.  It only increases the calories to 177 per muffin and they were delicious.  The second time, I used the apple sauce.  They were good, but not as good.  Third time was the charm! I used half apple sauce and half oil.  Perfect!

Great as is but made it even healthier and still delicious with only WW flour, banana instead of apple sauce, splenda instead of b.sugar and no salt.  About 83 cals and 1 gram of fat (1 point on Weight Watchers).

OMG!!!   I cannot tell you how surprised I was to taste these and actually love them.  They were so moist and flavorful for a low fat/low cal recipe.  I made a couple of minor changes though.  I used all whole wheat flour, bran flakes (could not find wheat bran in store) and frozen blueberries thawed.

These were great!  I accidentally added too many blueberries, so they were a bit soft and heavy, but that was my fault. My 9-year-old LOVES them and I feel great about letting her eat them!

These are good.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They have a very "bran-y" flavor to the them. I used frozen blueberries.  I would definitely make these again when I'm in the mood for a healthy, high fiber muffin.

I really like these muffins.  One tip I learned was that these really need to almost completely cool in the muffin pan, or you will lose the bottom of the muffin.  I tried to pull a few out to early, and they didn't come out all the way.  Flavor is great - love the fact that there is no oil in these, and they have lots of bluberries running through them.

Hearty, sweet, and moist. I followed the recipe to a T and will be making these muffins again, though I might cut back on the sugar. I took advice from a prior review and froze these muffins and microwave for 1 minute in the morning before enjoying. Quick, filling and tasty breakfast!

Excellent muffins. I changed the recipe as follows: Sub applesauce for 1 mushy bannana Sub 1 cup Blueberries for 1 cup Dried cranberries.   Excellent, filling snack. Fantastic with coffee!

I cant believe I found such an amazing low fat muffin!! My toddler doesn't notice they're healthy---she ate 3 in one sitting! I would eat the whole pan if i didn't stop myself! I used 1.5 cups of blueberries to make them extra moist.  For those of you on Weight Watchers, these are only 2 points per muffin! That's less than their 'official' blueberry muffins!

LOVE these!  We make them with either wheat or oat bran, 1/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar and all whole wheat flour for an even healthier muffin with even less calories!  Doesn't skimp on flavor either.  If you make them like we do, with 1/2 cup brown sugar, and make 18 muffins (if you make 12 like the recipe says they are BIG) they are only about 66 calories each!  By far our favorite muffin recipe out there, and we've tried lots.

These muffins are greta/ I use oiat bran and add all kinds of fruit. Favorite is blueberry and nuts. I have tried them w/applesauce but also olive oil. My favorite it to use walnut oil. Gives it a nutty flavor. Excellent!

These muffins are killer!  The only thing I did to sex em' up a bit was add 1/2 tsp more baking soda and a I topped them with a strudel: 1/4 cup oats, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp butter, and a dash of cinnamon. They would of been good without the strudel, but I think it kicked em' up.  These would be great with other berries and I think I'll try them with apples or bananas next time!  Love these little jewels!

These are my favorite muffins so far! I used all whole wheat flour, and substituted Splenda brown sugar. I was already in the process of making these when I realized I didn't have an egg, so I found the "Common Substitutions" listed on AllRecipes and used 1/2 of a banana mashed with 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder -- it worked perfectly.  The muffins were moist and not dense at all.  Definitely a keeper!

LOVE these muffins, I am a muffin fanatic but I am trying to eat healthy, and these were amazing... I make them every week. I used oat bran instead of wheat bran, and substituted half of the brown sugar for stevia, delicious!

I love these muffins! They are a filling, delicious way to start the day, and they are SO low in calories. 

I have messed around with the recipe and now use all whole-wheat flour (replace the all-purpose flour) and add 1/2 cup of ground flax seed to make them extra good. 

These freeze well, so you can essentially make 2.5 batches last a month if you eat them for breakfast!

Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Holy Cow!  I never thought bran could taste sooo good!  In the 2 days that I have had the recipe I have already made 3 dozen muffins.  To cut down on calories I used Splenda brown sugar (using only 1/3 cup), 1/4 cup Eggbeaters, and added 1 T. Cinnamon, and a 1/2 cup Splenda.  I was amazed at how VERY moist these muffins are and how easy they pop out of a sprayed muffin tin.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Terrific muffins, the entire family loved them. For bran muffins I was very surprise how moist they were, I did use the yogurt in place of the applesauce and I used lowfat soy milk, added the cinnamon as others suggested and put in alittle flax seed. Will definately make again and try some other fruits.

I love this recipe. I used soy milk instead of regular, doubled the vanilla, used oat bran instead of wheat, and dried mixed berries. The results? Fantastic, it tasted like a vanilla cupcake with berries - kids loved them

This recipe is fantastic! It has become a weekly recipe! I use all whole wheat flour, a little bit of cinnamon, a teaspoon of flaxseed, and I throw in whatever fruit I have on hand-right now the ones in the oven have 1 banana mashed, a handful of dried cranberries, raisins, blackberries, blueberries, and dried prunes (I went a little overboard!)...but they always turn out great! It's a very versitile recipe-Thanks soo much for sharing!

For being low fat these are delicious!  i didnt have apple sauce, so I used 1.1% yogurt, I substituted soymilk for the milk, and added cinnamon.  I ran out of vanilla, so I used almond extract.  I like a crunchy topping, therefore I mixed afew crushed walnuts, just right cereal, and brown sugar.  Delicious!  BTW, these need 25 mins in the over... and i would recommend not using liners.. i should have read the reviews before i baked them.

MMMMM... really good, filling bran muffins. i used the Splenda for baking brown sugar and All Bran cereal for bran and they came out just fine. Blueberries add just the right amount of sweetness without the guilt. Will bake again.

Great recipe - thank you.  I changed the recipe a bit and they still came out great.  Here are my changes:
*added 1/4 c wheat germ
*used 1/4 c oil (didn't have applesauce)
*added 1/4 tsp cinnamon

Someone mentioned them smelling like corn when they come out of the oven.  Muffins tend to "steam" if you leave them in the muffin tin and they can appear "wet" and/or smell funny when you first remove them.  They will not be like this once they have cooled.  I always find them tastier several hours later or the next day.  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed.

Man are these good!!! This is the ultimate versatile recipe I have been looking for! Blueberries were great, next time I might add some wheat germ for some nuttiness and some different berries! You can't go wrong with this one! The fiber count per muffin is about 4 grams (using all wheat flour) so it's a great recipe for people who need more fiber.

I'm addicted to these muffins.  I replace the milk with vanilla soymilk and the egg with half a banana and some baking powder for yummy vegan muffins.  It is also good to leave out the blueberries and add some cocoa if you want something more for dessert.  Yummy!

This was just what I needed, a high fiber muffin with flavor. I used 100% bran cereal and not sure if this is what wheat bran is but they turned out good.

These muffins were absolutely delicious!  I actually thought they were a little too sweet (and I did use unsweetened applesauce), so I may try reducing the brown sugar next time.

I totally love this recipe!  I operate several large community kitchens involving all age groups.  I have taken this recipe to each kitchen with phenominal success!  The participants love it, but more than that, it is actually good for them!  Awesome recipe Hilary.  I intend to try your recipe "Quinoa and Black Beans".  If you have any more excellent, nutritious recipes like the muffins, I'd love to see them.

I made this into a loaf and it was great for a low fat recipe. I made a few modifications based on what I had in the pantry. First I used oat bran instead of wheat bran. I used 3/4 c. of brown sugar and added more than 1/2 c. of milk. I also only had 1/4c of applesauce so I used 2Tbl. of butter and a 1/4c. low fat sour cream. I also used all wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp. of baking powder. This will make a tasty, healthy breakfast!! Will make again.

They're not awful, but the flavour is greatly lacking. I appreciate that they are low calorie and healthier, but I'd rather eat a tasty 200 calorie muffin than a bland 100 calorie muffin.

Really good, very moist muffins! I pretty much followed the recipe as written.  The only changes I made were to increase the vanilla extract to 1tsp and to use 3/4tsp baking powder and 1/4tsp baking soda.

I followed the directions as written except...I added more blueberries.  I didn't change the ingredients as some reviewers have done.  I'm sure this recipe can be "tweaked" to meet everyone's personal taste but  I wanted to try them as written (except for the extra blueberries!) before I started  making changes.   These are DELICIOUS and soooo moist for a bran muffin!   I baked these for 18 minutes and they came out perfectly. I also sprayed the muffin tin with cooking spray and they fell right out..just let them cool down for a bit before you try to remove them.  Next time I will double the recipe so I have more on hand.  I know these will go fast at my house!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious ... someone gave me a box of oat bran and I was looking to use it up ... so I substituded oat for wheat bran, followed exact recipe, but also added a tablespoon of orange rind.  As suggested topped with raw sugar grandules, and they came out moist, delicious, and healthy !  PS I tried the muffin recipe on the oat bran box and it was dry and tasteless.  Glad I decided to give it another shot and came to Allrecipe for help.

This is a great recipe - the muffins are moist and tasty.  I found there was too much batter for just 12, so made 16 muffins.  I ran the ingredients through My Fitness Pal and for 16 muffins, they are 88 calories each.

super healthy and so tasty... I didn't have any available muffin tins to I put mine in a loaf pan and baked lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked for 45 minutes.. It could have went a little longer probably 50-55 minutes... but it tasted wonderful and couldn't get any healthier...unless you cut back on the sugar... which I may do next time... if you think it tastes a little bland add some cinnamon but otherwise i like it just how it is.

Very Good recipe, however to make it a little more healthy, I changed the ingredients up a bit, give it a try :)

1 1/2 cups All-Bran cereal
1 cup vanilla whey protein powder solution 
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 egg white (or 2 tbsp of the carton egg whites)
1/3 cup brown sugar blend
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup blueberries (I used mixed berries)

Love these, make them almost every Sunday to go with my yogurt for breakfast through the week. Moist low fat and healthy. I do however substitute the brown sugar with Splenda and use all whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 & 1/2. Hubby loves them too.

If you're used to light, fluffy, sweet muffins, don't try this recipe. If you want a grainy, healthy, low-cal, surprisingly tasty muffin that you can feel good about, do try it. I added 1 tsp. of nutmeg. I also followed someone's suggestion and used only whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup honey, and no brown sugar. (Might add some Xylitol as well, next time.)

They are decent for the calories but it's definitely not my favorite healthy muffin.

I can't believe how good these muffins are!  I followed the recipe exact but omitted the baking soda and used all whole wheat flour.  I was worried about the consistency of the batter (it was really runny) but they puffed up and came out moist and lovely.  Definitely a keeper!:)

WOW....VERY VERY IMPRESSED!!!  I must admit, I used raspberries instead because I wanted to make lemon raspberry muffins...regardless this is a KEEPER!!!  I can't wait to make them as blueberry muffies!!!

If you want the raspberry version:  1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries, 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice and 1 tsp fresh lemon zest.

I've been making these for about a year now.  Always delicious.
ETA - This is a great base recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of blueberries so I often sub other fruits, or if you're looking for healthy-but-decadent then add a scant 1/2 cup cocoa powder to the batter and sub chocolate chips for the berries.  Small children will devour these.

I LOVE these muffins.  I added in a banana and instead of applesauce (didn't have time to make it), just threw in some chopped apple with cinnamon and they turned out so moist and fantastic.  I also used 1/3 cup of agave nectar and the rest was brown sugar which probably contributed to the moistness.  This is basically my favorite breakfast food to have now with a piece of fruit.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good base recipe! I subbed oats (ground) and flax for the bran since I did not have any. I also added a teaspoon of lemon to the milk, 1 mashed banana cause it was just sitting there staring at me, misread recipe and added 3/4 c brown sugar (think I will keep it that way) and finally I increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. Yummy!

this is an excellent blueberry bran muffin recipe- I did not have bran on hand so I used wheat germ instead and they turned out wonderfully! I have added this recipe to my recipe box as I intend on using it for many more times to come

This muffins are awesome! I loaded them with extra stuff: few tb. sps. flax seeds, ground flax and millet, extra vanilla extract, a little almond extract, and about doubled the blueberries. 
I'm so impressed with the recipe. I've been having one every morning since I made them last week.

I think these are fantastic.  Only change I made was using 1/3 cup brown sugar splenda instead of regular brown sugar.  I only did that because my husband is diabetic so we try to cut the sugar where we can.  No changes are necessary to this recipe.

This was easy and healthy!  I wanted to find a recipe for low fat muffins, so I can make batches and freeze them for a quick breakfast or snack.  I used oat bran instead, because I like the texture better.  My family loved these, so it's a keeper for us.

These are really great. I used a "flax-egg" (1T. flaxmeal + 3T. water) instead of the egg, the juice and zest of an orange, some cinnamon and nutmeg, and forgot the vanilla - and they came out great. They taste delicious and are so wholesome.

These muffins are very good. Knowing that they have less then 100 calories make them even better. I substituted wheat germ for the wheat bran because that's what I had on hand. Soaked it in the milk as stated but only added about a cup of it to the batter. Love the fact that they are so healthy compared to a traditional blueberry muffin. My daughter and husband also enjoyed them.

These muffins were fantastic!  Based off of a couple of reviews I did tweak it just a little and I threw in some of my own additions.  I used All Bran Buds and I soaked them in 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c orange juice.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 c because I had sweetened applesauce.  I used 1 1/2 t baking soda and 1/2 t baking powder.  I added 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/2 t fresh orange zest.  These were not dry, not soggy, just perfectly moist and delicious.  Nor were they too dense either.  My husband LOVED these. Great to make ahead and have something quick and healthy in the morning during the week.

I LOVE these!!!  The only thing I might do different next time is use a little more sweetener.  I used Whey-Low Brown sugar substitute in place of regular brown sugar.  Also added about an extra 1/3 cup blueberries (I used frozen blueberries that I tossed in the flour mixture before adding it to the sugar mixture).  These rose up beautifully and looked as good as they tasted!

This is the third blueberry muffin recipe I've tried from online sites this winter.  It's definitely the best of the three!  You can tell it's healthy but it is very good.  My husband and I both like it!  It made the cut for my personal cookbook!

I've been making these low fat blueberry muffins for a while now...they always turn out!!  I've started using 1/3 cup brown sugar splenda blend, and maybe a couple of good sized tbsp of yogurt, blueberry or whatever is on hand...and 1 cup of whole wheat flour...I've also use muffin paper liners and didn't like the results...since they're low fat, better luck using Pam...

Pretty amazing muffin for having no oil Or butter! I had to replace the wheat bran with  Oats and I didn't have enough sugar on hand so replaced it with 1/3 sugar- 1/3 maple syrup- also  Used vanilla almond milk in place of milk- the recipe does give lots of room to play around- and it still tasted really yummy!

Ummm.... these were not good. I have made lots of healthy muffins before, but these were bitter and tasted like bran. Texture was good, and they were moist, which is why I give them 2 stars, but I will have to completely change the ingredients for flavor.

Had some very good blueberry bran muffins at a local cafe and was trying to duplicate. I think this recipe tops the ones we had! I made recipe w/ the extra pinch of baking powder and "some" cinnamon, came easily right out of the muffin pan w/o liners. I was able to easily make 15 muffins w/ this recipe. Will use again and again!

LOVE these!  I did use all whole wheat (white) flour instead of the bran and some white flour.  (only because I didn't have bran on hand).  I agree with other reviewers that these are best kept in the freezer and pulled out ahead of time, but it works really well if you are not going to eat them all in a matter of a day or two.  I also made them another time using half splenda and half brown sugar, as well as with three egg whites and no yoke (hubby is watching cholesterol) they tasted great, but were hard to get out of the wrapper lol. very moist and delicious!!

Wayyyy too many blueberries - some of my muffins were practically purple all the way through and it overwhelmed the taste of the muffin.  I can't even tell you how the muffin itself tastes b/c of all the blueberries. We're going to try it again with raisins and go light-handed.

Yum! I doubled the blueberries and used all white whole wheat flour. I also substituted Splenda for 25% of the brown sugar. They weren't all that sweet - I liked them that way, though my mom complained she wanted them sweeter. Added a pinch of cinnamon, too.

They are definately marathon muffins as they fill you up and really stick it to you or just stick with you. I reduced the to 1/2 a cup but added an extra 1/2 a cup of blueberries for extra flavour. Definately a healthy muffin but next time I'm adding a tblspoon of baking powder so they just don't flatten on me.

Absolutely delicious!! Followed the recipe completely.  Make a dozen at a time and  freeze them.  Pop a frozen muffin in the microwave for 1 minute throughout the week for a quick healthy breakfast with a cup of coffee on the go!  I want to try them with raisins or cranberries instead of blueberries.  Thank you 3LIONCUBS!!! Yummy.  My husband loves them, too.

The first couple of times I tried this recipe I used “all bran” cereal.  The muffins came out great.  When I used wheat bran they were even better.  The bran adds a nice nutty character.  I have used both fresh and frozen blueberries but like the convenience of the frozen ones.  These are easy to make, taste great, and are practically fat free!  It doesn’t get much better than this.

Healthy and delicious!  I brought the muffins to a playdate picnic.  All our little toddlers LOVED them.  The moms did too :)   I did make a couple modifications... reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, I beat the egg to give it a little fluff, and I used 2 cups of frozen organic blueberries (I just let the blueberries defrost on the counter while I prepared the muffins).  I wound up cooking them a bit longer - around 25 minutes.  Maybe because all those berries cooled the batter so much.  I'll definitely make these again.  Next time I'll probably add 1/4 cup of walnuts to half the batch (my husband and I love nutty muffins and it makes them that much more balanced and nutritious).

wonderful!  I didn't have wheat bran, so like others, I soaked 1 1/2 cups all bran cereal in 1 cup milk for 10-15 min; I also didn't have blueberries, so I soaked 1/4 cup raisins in boiling water for the same amount of time as the cereal, and peeled and chopped 2 apples.  Additionally, I used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp soda (both sifted) and added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I don't know if it's because of the muffin pan I have, but I didn't need muffin liners or a spray, and they came right out. I can't believe how moist these muffins are!!

I have made these several times and they are a hit with my family. I usually double the blueberries, because it is a great way for my kids to have fruit! They aare VERY moist and spoil easily, so eat the within one day or refrigerate.

Just made these today and they are great!  I had blueberries and bananas that needed to find a home and they found it here!!  I did substitute a large banana for the applesauce.  I used about 1.75 cups of blueberries.  I am always looking for a healthy after school snack and my 16 year old loves these.

I loved this recipe I don't normally make comments but I had to tell everyone what an excellent recipe this is. According to the calorie count etc. that some of the other ladies calculated that would mean that the Weight Watcher point would be only 1 they are way to good to only be one point. The WW muffins are 3 and they are terrible compared to these. The only thing I changed is I only used the egg white and followed one of the other reviews and added straight Whole wheat flour no white and a little bit of cinnamon. Thanks to this recipe I can eat muffins again on my diet.

These are great with good healthy ingredients.  If you are looking for a sweet bakery type muffin don't make these.    I like this recipe because you can add walnuts, ground flax seed, etc to give it a more healthy boost.    I used frozen blueberries and let them sit in the strainer overnight in the fridge so they didn't make the muffin soggy.

This recipe is fantastic! The texture is perfect. My modifications: 2 eggwhites instead of the egg, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup buckwheat flour instead of w.w. and I added 2 tbsp flax seed meal as well as 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. The spices were a very delicious addition. I can't wait to make these again!

These are wonderful! They freeze well, I made a double batch and keep them handy when my boyfriend and I need a quick breakfast or snack. Just make sure you wrap each one in plastic wrap and place in an air tight container. I substituted the egg for an egg substitute and they came out great! I also mixed the blueberries with the dry mix to prevent them from sinking in the mix. Then I incorporated them with the wet ingredients. I will be making these again!

Fabulous! Love that there is no fat used in this recipe. I used raisin bran cereal, including the raisins, instead of the bran; 1/3 C. Splenda and 1/3 C. brown sugar for the sugar and omitted the baking soda. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I would use more fresh or frozen blueberries next time. Turned out great. Put them in a freezer bag after cooling and pull them out for breakfast or coffee treats.  Thanks for such a good, healthy recipe. Something you don't have to feel guilty about.

I have no clue where I went wrong.  Like many others my muffins are crispy on the outside with wet centers.  The flavor is great, but the middle is not baked.

These were excellent and easy to make with my 2 1/2 year old.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of applesauce, but other than that followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I think we'll have to try them with raisins next time, as my son won't eat blueerries.

I've never tried this recipe, but I'm giving LEMONY'S review 5-stars for being HILARIOUS. Love the wit. UPDATE: Just tried it, and it's GREAT. Used 1/3 cup of applesauce and one mashed banana. Also used all whole wheat flour and added the zest of one lemon. They were healthy and delicious. Makes you wonder why people are still using high-fat recipes when the ones with significantly less fat taste (debatably) better. I love finding new, healthy, and VERY delicious recipes. Thank you for posting!

These came out really good.  I didn't have enough bran so I had to substitute 3/4 cup of Wheat germ instead.  They had excellent flavor and texture.  Mine were moist and not too heavy at all.  Great for a quick snack or an on the go breakfast.  Yummy!

This was very good, but I was looking for a heartier bran muffin.  (Also, I'm not sure how people got 12 muffins from this recipe without using mini muffin pan.)  Followed suggestion of others and increased baking soda and powder, substituted nonfat yogurt for applesauce.  Maybe, I'll increase the bran next time.

Followed other reviewers suggestions. Used Brown Sugar Splenda, Wheat Flour only, All Bran, and egg whites. I made them thinking I would be the only one who liked them. I was going to freeze them for quick breakfasts. Well.... there are only 2 left. My teenager said they were "rediculous"---apparetly that means 'good' since she ate three. The rest of the family loved them too. I didn't even tell them that they were a "healthy Chioce!".

THESE ARE THE BEST!!  I've been searching for soooo long for a healthy delicous, semi-dense and moist bran muffin recipe and finally I have found it!!  I followed the recipe to a T (except I made 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12) and they came out gorgeous!  I used a crown top jumbo muffin pan and they looked like I just bought them from a gourment bakery downtown somewhere.  The best part is that the jumbo muffins came out to be approx. 200 calories each!  Yum!  My search is over.  A++

Very moist and healthy.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar and liquid egg white instead of a whole egg.  Delicious.  My 3 yr old even loved them!

I love bran muffins, but the bakery/store muffins really aren't that healthy so I was really excited to try making them myself.  These turned out really well. They were pretty good as written (minus the blueberries, I like plain bran muffins; I also never add salt and am allergic to vanilla), but the second time I made changes that made them REALLY good!  I added about 4 tlbs molasses, a cup of leftover prepared old fashioned oatmeal, used all ww pastry flour, and used 3 tlbs melted (real) butter instead of the applesauce.  It added a bit of fat, but also more fiber and definately more flavor and I used up leftover breakfast that would have been thrown away.  The oatmeal actually gave it really good texture.

I love bran muffins, and for a low-fat recipe, these are great. The only thing I changed was to use all whole wheat flour. I will definitely make these again.

Very good!
I did oat bran instead of wheat bran because that was what I had on hand.  
Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, took a frozen banana and mashed it instead of the applesauce,and 1/4 cup of honey instead of brown sugar.  Yummy!
Oh, and people had been mentioning not tasting the blueberries, so I did 2 cups of blueberries and I can definitely taste them! (:

Great recipe! I've made 3 batches in the past 2 weeks. The only changes I made were to use 1 cup of whole wheat flour (I don't have any white) and to cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. These muffins turn out moist and delicious every time; I have 2 of them for breakfast and it's a great start to my day!

It's so nice to add recipes like this to my recipe book.  Very good, satisfying flavor, especially when you eat them fresh from the oven.  My kids didn't know they were good for them.  They are a little sweet but I like them that way.

Have used this recipe countless number of times, with variations.  The base works wonderfully with mashed bananas, cranberries, or added chopped nuts.  Vanilla Butter and Nut flavoring also adds a bit of "nutty" flavor, when used in place of straight vanilla.  This recipe also easily works as a loaf, using a lower bake temp.  Kudos to this recipe's origin!

These are really good just as is, but sometimes in addition to the blueberries I dice up 1 apple usually something tart like a granny smith just to change it up if you eat them a lot.

These muffins came out soo delicious and moist!! The only change I made was using eggbeaters instead of an egg. The best part is that one muffin is only 2 W.W. points! 
They taste much better than the store bought lowfat type muffins.

These were wonderful. I used Oat Bran flour instead of wheat bran because I had some on hand, and they worked beautifully! This yielded 18 muffins for me.

these are the most fantastic low fat anything I have ever tasted.  They are so easy to make.  i have tried fresh and frozen blueberries.  I have used all bran cereal and soy milk instead of the wheat bran and milk and they are just delicious.  An A+++ recipe.

Fantastic muffins!!!!  I highly suggest adding 1 heaping tsp of cinnamon for some extra flavor.  They were fine without the cinnamon but even better with.  I also added flax seeds for a little extra goodness and extra blueberries.

I love these muffins.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and used 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg.  I have made them a few times and have found that it is better to spray the muffin tin with cooking spray rather than use paper liners.  The paper sticks too much to the muffin.

These were good the first day but the next day they were almost too moist & flavorless. I would not make these again without modifying the recipe--maybe cutting back on the milk & adding some cinnamon or something.  Not sure why these were so blah the second day.

Ever since coming across this recipe there hasn't been a time where I've been without these muffins - I keep on making them.  Healthy and tasty.  These freeze well and I could get a nice warm muffin any time after putting one in the microwave.

I was really excited for this recipe because of all the great reviews it recieved.  However, only I deviated from the recipe a bit by using only all-purpose flour and pureed apples (in place of applesauce).  It turned out pretty bland and it smelled like corn.  Anyone have any suggestions for improvement?  I don't have any whole wheat flour...

This recipe is definitely a keeper in my healthy snacks/breakfasts recipes!  I pushed this recipe to its limits when I first made it:  I exchanged half a banana for the egg, used sweetened applesauce, omitted all the brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The muffins still came out delicious, fragrant, and slightly sweet.  I freeze the baked muffins and pop them in my bag for breakfast or an afternoon snack.

These muffins are really good. I didn't have applesauce so I replaced it with mashed bananas. I didn't think the batter would be sweet enough so I added 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 tsp of cinnamon and they turned out great. I'll try it with the applesauce next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought it tasted good and was easy to make but, instead of using blueberries I used apricots and some walnuts. I boiled some dried apricots until they were soft and then cut them into little pieces and added them to the batter along with the nuts. I liked the flavor and texture that was created using these instead of blueberries.

Definitely a HEALTHY muffin ... but it's good considering it's a healthy muffin!  We think it needs more sugar (and more blueberries -- we added 1/2 cup more).  Like a lot of other people, we used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of normal flour.  We added ~1/4 tsp. more of both baking powder and baking soda to compensate for not having AP flour.  Overall, a good muffin recipe, and we will try it again.  :)

Oh, not good at all!  I made these to take to a ladies church function but after trying one I decided against it.  They had no flavor, all the blueberries sank to the bottom, and they were hard on the outside and mushy in the middle.  I followed the directions to a "T" and consider myself a good cook but these didn't make the grade!

This was a great recipe to work from. I was looking for a banana bran muffin recipe but couldn't find one I liked. For this recipe I used 2 bananas instead of blueberries and 1 container of non-fat plain yogurt instead of applesause. They came out super moist and delicous. I think I'll use another banana next time and only 1/2 cup yogurt. Yum

This recipe produces very moist muffins, a big plus in my book (given how healthy and high in fiber they are).  I think they need a little more spice, though.  Next time I plan to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to give them more flavor.  Great "basic" recipe, though, and really good for you.

I had a hard time rating this muffin recipe. For a healthy choice I would give it a five. Otherwise I would give it a three. I guess I am just used to the flavor of the more cakey type muffins, which I do like the taste of better. However, for a healthy choice, this is a decent recipe. I did find the recipe a little sweet for my tastes, so I will cut the sugar if I try them again. For those on Weight Watchers, a muffin is worth 2 points, much better than the 4.5 points of my other muffins. So, from a health standpoint, I will be making them again. Just not sure if I would make them for company.

This is the first time I have tried to make a low-fat sweet bread/muffin recipe, and it came out great!  Despite the absence of oil/butter, the muffins were still moist several days later.  I substituted apple butter for the applesauce and yogurt for half of the milk and also added some cinammon.

I made these for my sister who is on a severly restricted diet and we all loved them!  I cut the salt in half and substituted splenda for half of the brown sugar.  My "won't eat it if it's healthy" husband even loved them so much I made a batch just for him.  That's a good recipe!

These muffins came out PERFECT. The taste is just right, a little sweet to satisfy that sweet tooth. They are AMAZING! I used OAT BRAN (because I couldn't find wheat bran) and they came out delicious! They came out moist and oh so, so good. They don't even taste low-fat.

These are fantastic! I always make 24, but set the recipe to 36 servings, to get large muffins. And then I healthified the recipe (based on 36 servings, as mentioned above): Switch from cow milk to either 3 cups store-bought almond milk or 4 cups unstrained almond milk if you're making it at home. If I don't have apple sauce, I use fork mashed bananas. Instead of eggs I use 3 tbsp chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water. I skip the sugar completely, use all 3 cups whole wheat flour, skip the salt, and instead of 3 cups blueberries, use 1 cup blueberries and 2 cups raisins. So come to think of it, it really became a completely new recipe! The raisins sweeten them perfectly. They taste great, and are completely fat free and free of refined sugars as well. These are a staple at our house!

i doubled the recipe and baked for 25 minutes. I used frozen blueberries and added one chopped apple. They tasted good but the blueberries sank to the bottom and they didn't exactly pop out of the muffin pan. I will try it again but not with frozen berries.

These are awesome!  I didn't make any changes but next time I will try a dried fruit, maybe raisins, since the blueberries made them a bit soggy by the end of the day.  No fruit would be good too; a great recipe!

I didn't have wheat bran so I used natural old fashioned oats instead.  I also added 1/8 c organic milled flax seed.  They were very moist and delicious.

Made these earlier today,they came out great!
I did couple adjustments and substitution.
I used oat bran and not wheat bran.
Used 1/4 cup stone ground whole wheat and 1/4 cup quick cooking oats instead of 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.
Added about 2 tablespoons golden flax seeds,teaspoon of poppy seeds,teaspoon of grape seed oil and half teaspoon of chia seeds.Made my own unsweetened applesauce with unpeeled apples.
Good stuff!Nice and hearty muffins!
Also I was using a black nonstick pan ,reduced temp to 350 and baked for about 17 minutes.Will make again soon.
Happy baking!

I really enjoyed these I added 1/2 c of oats and sprinkles the tops with a little cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking them. I knew I would be the only one eating them so I froze them individually so I could just pop one out, microwave it and eat it.

I really like these muffins! I used oat bran (Bob's Red Mill) instead of wheat bran, and I used white whole wheat flour instead of regular whole wheat. I didn't sub out the all-purpose flour though. I got 17 2inch muffins at 80 calories each and 3 grams of fiber. Next time I plan to add a little cinnamon.

I've made these about a dozen times now and my whole family loves them. I make them as mini-muffins and just shave down the baking time. I've made them with either fresh blueberries or thawed frozen blueberries.

These were really moist and great texture. I went with the suggested substitution of banana, honey and all w.w flour. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time I think I will try them with almond extract rather than vanilla and maybe a little nutmeg. Definitely will make again. Great recipe.

I am having the same problem with rawness in the middle. Is that from using fresh blueberries instead of frozen or dried? The outside seems yummy, though. I am leaving them in for a little longer to see if that will help. Any suggestions about the squishy middle? This doesn't usually happen when I bake muffins.

Moist, chewy.  Just the right amount of sweet.  No substitutions but I made 16 muffins instead of 12.

Amazing for it being low-fat. I tweaked it a little to cut some of the calories. Instead of adding brown sugar, I used the twin sugar brown sugar. It's basically a sweetener like Splenda made to taste like brown sugar. A lot of diabetics use it. Also instead of vanilla extract, I used imitation. Came out to about 80-85 calories. I used sugar-free smuckers blueberry jam to go with it but my family put butter on theirs. Went nicely with a small yogurt with chopped almond.

Definitely don't fit the author's description, if it is supposed to mean just as delicious as a regular blueberry muffin. If they are saying just as delicious as a bran muffin, then I agree. These are bran muffins with blueberries. So, in that sense, they are good. But definitely not sweet, and they are very branny/grainy like a bran muffin should be. I will keep looking for a healthy, more flavorful blueberry muffin.

Delicious muffins, can't believe that they are low-fat and healthy!  I will be making these often!  I took the advice of some other reviews and added 1/2 of a smashed-up ripe banana and a tsp of honey for sweetness,and used all whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 wheat, 1/2 white.  They turned out great!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These muffins were absolutely delicious!  I've been looking for a low-fat, high fiber muffin recipe, and this is it.  I had to make a couple of substitutions, but I'm sure these would have been equally delicious as written.  I couldn't find wheat bran so I used 1 1/2 cups of oat bran.  And I substituted 1 cup almond milk (original, 60 calories per cup) for the nonfat milk.  Everything else was as written.  Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely loved these muffins! I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. Also I didn't have any wheat bran so I used all bran instead, and pulsed it a few times in a magic bullet (you could alternatively use a food processor) to turn it into a powder. I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar (not packed) but found it a bit too sweet for my liking so I'll probably reduce this the next time I make these - yes I will be making them again! I think the reason for the over sweetness was the sugar that the all bran cereal added to the muffins. I love gooey blueberries in my muffins so I added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries, and might even used 2 cups total next time. I checked the muffins after 18 minutes and they seemed done from the outside but on the inside they were not fully cooked so I kept them for a total of 20 minutes. Also I made the mistake of making these at 11:30 at night so I regrettably couldn't gobble down half the batch fresh from the oven. But they tasted wonderful the next day as well. Overall a wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

I never seem to have much luck with baking, so I was quite pleased that these turned out perfectly on my first try. They were much tastier than I had been expecting for a low-fat recipe. I'll definitely be making them again.

I did not have any bran so I replaced it using oatmeal. This recipe is so good and only 1.5 g of fat per. Soak oatmeal just like the bran.  Mix the eg and sugar mixture into the oatmeal when it is ready   Let it sit while you sift flour so flavors come out. Yum

I made these with the intention of giving them as a gift to be frozen and ended up eating three before I even took them out of the tin to cool. So good! I ended up using 3/4 cup oat bran in place of the 1 1/2 cups wheat bran because that's all my grocery store had stocked at 6am. Still came out wonderful. Please try these!

This isn't an honest 5 stars. I was missing ingredients so I modified the recipe. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of wheat bran, 1/2 cup all purpose flour and I sprinkled brown sugar on top. This was AMAZING! Super moist and full of fiber.

I made a couple substitutions for health reasons and they still turned out fantastic! I didn't have wheat bran so I used wheat germ. I don't do dairy, so I substituted soy milk for the nonfat milk. I used Splenda brown sugar for the regular brown sugar and used 1/4 cup Eggbeaters egg substitute for the egg. They are so moist and juicy when you bite into them, and I can eat them without any guilt! When I tell people to try my non-fat, non-dairy, no sugar muffins, they say yuck, but end up loving them! They are my daily morning snack.

Definitely a 5 star keeper.  I followed the advice of others and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1 cup wheat flour - no white flour.  I didn't have wheat bran or all bran cereal, so I used fiber one cereal, and they came out fantastic.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent.  I found they were light and fluffy made with wheat bran and 1 c. white flour and no wheat flour. (Wheat flour is hard to keep fresh on hand).  I customized it with several of the suggestions reviewers made like trying a variety of fresh and/or dried fruits and reduced brown sugar to 1/2c.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and a 1/2 c. coarsely chopped pecans.  The batter keeps for a few days in the fridge in order to quickly bake a couple while getting ready for work so I can grab them along with my travel mug of coffee as I head out the door.  Yummy healthy, satisfying start to the day.

Simply Delicious!! The only thing I substituted is milk for almond unsweetened milk. They turned out so fluffy, sweet and delicious! I made them for breakfast for next day and we ended up eating more than half of them at night. My kids age 2 and 5 were asking for more and more.....

Wow - these blueberry muffins are something.  Normally I prefer my muffins warm, these I found tasted better cooled.  I made no changes to the recipe, and have already made them twice.  They turned out perfectly.

Made this recipe with a few changes yesterday and they turned out absolutely amazing. I used oat bran instead of wheat bran because I couldn't find it at the store, I used all wheat flour and no white flour, I didn't have any vanilla extract, I added a little bit of cinnamon, and also I used the splenda brown sugar mix instead of brown sugar. They tasted great and were so moist! Definitely making these again

I halved the recipe, omitted the blueberries and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup. The texture and taste is phenomenal! Way better than any store-bought bran muffins I have ever had.

I used low fat buttermilk instead of regular milk. They tasted great. They would've been better if I'd paid attention to the first step -to soak the bran in milk for 10 minutes. Great healthy snack!

Made these 2x now and they are great.  I add flax seed for an extra nutrition boost.  First time I made w/ diced apples instead of blueberries and I think I like it better that way, add a pinch of cinnamon too.  Really can try any fruit you want.

Just made these muffins and they are delicious! A little crusty on top, dense and flavorful. I didn't have applesauce so I used vegetable shortening which turned out fine. Might have been my new old oven, it took a long time to bake, I waited until my toothpick came out clean before taking them out. Will make them again!

These are delicious for a low fat, high fiber snack!  I absolutely love them, but my kids do not like them at all because they are not used to bran muffins.  That is fine with me, though, because I am on a low fat diet and I can freeze them and have them whenever I feel like something sweet.  I made the recipe exactly as given and didn't change a thing.  Fabulous!!!

I thought these muffins were very yummy!  I did not add a full cup of blueberries, maybe 3/4 of a cup.  I folded them in just until there seemed to be a good ratio.  I think if I had added the full cup then there would have been too many blueberries.  I received good feedback from the people who ate them but some also complained that they smelled like "birdseed".  I guess that's what happens when you bake healthy food for teenagers... :-)

These are so delicious with fresh blueberries, and super filling for a fabulous, low-fat, high-energy breakfast. They're a hit in our house, especially warmed up for a few seconds in the microwave or toaster oven!

I absolutely love these muffins! They are the best I have ever made, even including some with oil & more sugar. Try them!  FYI - I used all regular flour (out of whole wheat), oat bran, & frozen blueberries.

Don't know what went wrong, but these were beyond "moist" to the point of being mushy and mold-breeding within two days. The taste was good, but I wouldn't make these again if I have to eat them all, with a spoon, in the first six hours out of the oven. I was so excited for this recipe, wish it had turned out.

These are excellent.  I only changed the sugar, used 1/3 cup Splenda brown and they were sweet enough.  I would use a greased muffin tin instead of paper muffin cups.

Delicious!  We all loved them.  A little bit TOO moist maybe...I might try cooking them a bit longer next time or maybe use a little less apple sauce.

Possibly the best bran muffins I have ever made! I couldn't believe how moist they were - even after reading all the reviews saying so.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, and used frozen raspberries and these were a BIG hit. I am so happy I stumbled across this recipe!!

I wasn't very impressed with these muffins...although they weren't terrible for being healthy. I only had sweetened applesauce, so I cut back on the brown sugar. I felt that they were too sweet, even with those changes. And the texture wasn't that great...too much bran in my opinion. No one else in my family would eat them...they looked too weird and healthy. One thing that is good about these muffins, though, is that they are moist, just like the description states. They definitely weren't gone before there was time for them to cool though...it's been three days and there are still two left. Sorry, but I won't be making these muffins again!

I thought these were fantastic, just the way they were.  Didn't change anything, except for I threw in about a tbsp of Flax, just because it was there, and figured it wouldn't hurt to up the nutrition a bit.  These were great, we didn't even wait for them to cool before digging in!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good! A good snack to keep around. I did make some modifications. I used only whole wheat flour, egg whites instead of the egg, and only 1/2 cup of sugar.

These muffins were excellent.  I used Oat Bran because I didn't have wheat bran in the house I replaced the white flour with Nutri Flour and added some cinnamon.  You would not know that these are low fat. Really good.

These were delicious and so wonderful.  I love it when I find recipes that combine healthy ingredients and great taste.  Thanks for sharing!  I also added some pumpkin pie spice.  Delish!

Good recipe. Made the following changes: used 1 cup  ww-flour, 1.5 tsp each of baking soda and powder, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. Instead of blueberries, I added the zest of one navel orange into the applesauce/egg mixture and folded in frozen whole cranberries. They weren't really sweet enough but that's probably a good thing!

This is an excellent recipe that my family adores.  I actually use 1/4 C oil and 1/4 C applesauce, just to give them a little more moistness but it's fabulous.

Amazing! So good and healthy at the same time.  Beats the store-bought protein bars in the morning.  I took most of the users' advice and used all wheat flour, and increased the BP and BS.  I also used Oat bran and added a banana. Yum! Even bf who is not too big on healthy treats raved about them.

The only things I changed were adding 1 full tsp of vanilla and using whole wheat pastry flour for all of the flour. These are nice and moist, but maybe a little too branny for me, so I gave them a 4. I might make them again with banana.

Easy, tasty low-fat recipe - with great muffin consistency.  Would make again.  Did modify as follows:  3/4 cup ground oatmeal (substitute for wheat bran) 1 cup WW flour (no white flour) 1/4 cup honey (substitue for brown sugar)  1 ripe banana I had in the freezer  (substitue for applesauce) 1 tsp vanilla  Cooking time increased by approx 5 minutes

I only had oat bran, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. They are tasty and moist and do not resemble the dry low-fat muffins I have purchased at coffee houses. Will recommend and make again. They were a hit with my kids and my extremely health conscious husband.

nice healthy alternative.  Did use whole wheat flour instead of white and brown sugar splenda in place of the sugar.  Kids loved them and even asked if they were the healthy muffins ;)

By far the best bran muffin I've had on this site.  I couldn't find wheat bran at our grocery store, so used bran flakes instead.  I did crush them up a bit before soaking in the milk.  Other than that substitution, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  Such a moist, not too sweet treat... And it's even healthy!  I think these would be great with other berries and dried fruits.  Definitely a keeper in my house :)

This was a pretty healthy-like muffin that was better when warm with butter.  I took the advice of others and added more blueberries;about 1/2 cup more.   Not too big a hit with the youngsters.  But us Older folks liked them.  Sheryle & Rich

Great recipe, used multigrain flower instead of all purpose (I was out) and they turned out perfect.  Don't put the blueberries in at the very end as I did and they turned mushy.  I made 3 with rasins and I'll do that next time as they turned out really well.  Sticks to the paper.. not sure what I did wrong if anything, maybe the paper is just bad, no wax?

A pretty decent healthy muffin.  Only complaint was that they were probably too moist - maybe they needed to bake a bit longer.  I used paper muffin cases and on the day of baking the muffins stuck to the liners badly but the next couple of days the muffins came away easily.  If you want to eat them the same day might be worth greasing the bottom of the liners.  Will be trying these again - lots of possible variations.

Amazing bran muffins!  What better way to get fiber in your diet.  I also made this recipe once with 1/2 the bran and the other 1/2 ground flax seed, for the omegas. and it too, was great.  Thank you!

I made these today and they are very easy to make but just not sweet enough for my taste.  Could have been the fact that my blue berries were rather tart and also the fact that I used 1/4 cup of honey insted of the brown sugar.  DBF hasn't tried them yet but I don't think I will make these again.

These muffins are definitely healthy, but I found them quite small and dry. If I make them again I might mash a ripe banana into the batter to add some extra moisture.

I followed the recipe, no exceptions, they were great.  This may replace the recipe I love that uses all bran.  Be sure mix in the flour just until moist to ensure light airy moist muffins.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! I loved the fact there was no butter! I did use the 1 1/2 cups of oat bran (couldn't find wheat), plus I increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoon, and substituted out the brown sugar for 1/4 cup of honey like another reviewer did. Continually trying to watch my weight, I felt only a little guilt indulging in these. I didn't have any wheat flour, so just used white and it was absolutely fine.

No one call tell it's healthy!  I prefer applesauce vs banana, may be b/c the banana was not ripe enough (can't wait for it to have those little black spots). The applesauce is with cinnamon.  My co-workers all loved it! Will definitely become a favorite recipe.  Thanks for sharing. I think 2/3 cup of brown sugar can be lessen according to taste. I'll update next time when 1/2 cup is used.  Update: 1/2 cup brown sugar is good enough.  I already did the recipe 3x!

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover - getting a little too old for salad - blueberries, and this was perfect! I didn't have wheat bran, but I used FiberOne cereal instead and it worked great. I put a few too many blueberries in, and since they were fresh the muffins became a little hard to handle (also put them in paper wrappers which didn't help), but still delicious!

Delicious! I used all-bran as that's what we had on hand.  Per some of the other comments I added 1/2tsp cinnamon, about 1/8tsp nutmeg, and almost another 1/2 cup of fresh blueberrys.

For a low-fat, low-calorie muffin, these are excellent. Also, they're not dry & dull like a normal bran muffin, nor are they greasy like some bran muffins can be. I followed the recipe to a T, though I may add cinnamon next time. I've made these with fresh blueberries, as well as frozen wild blueberries, both with excellent results.

Very moist! I used strawberries this time. I cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I will try to use whole wheat flour only next time as suggested by others.

Made a modified version of these delicious and successful muffins on my blog. Substituted bluberries with plums, made the flour 100% whole wheat, added soy milk instead of normal milk.  Worked out just GREAT!  Thanks!!!

Loved this recipe! It is a great healthy alternative to regular muffins which are delicious, but pack the calories. I followed the recipe except for I too used 1 tsp of vanilla and I used only whole wheat flour. I was also running a little low on milk, so for the  small amount I lacked a used a scoop of vanilla yogurt that I had. I read that yogurt adds more moisture which these definitely did not lack!

Yummy and so filling! I used all whole wheat flour and increased the amount of blueberries (i used frozen-slightly thawed). I topped the muffins with an oatmeal struesel topping using quick oats, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. I had no trouble getting the muffins out of the pan, but I also greased them pretty well with butter. These muffins were delicious and thank you for sharing!

How can something so healthy taste so good?  Only problem - with no oil or butter in the muffins, they really stick to the paper liners.

I add nutmeg, cinnamon, & 1/2 c. nuts. Sometimes I double the blueberries or use other fruit (like apples). I also often use a banana or yogurt instead of the apple sauce. Make them all the time & love them!

I made these exactly as the recipe states, except I added 1 cup of blueberries instead of 1/2 cup.  I found them a bit bland so next time I think I'll add some cinnamon.

Incredible. I must admit that I did tweak this recipe slightly according to what I had on hand: I used Fiber One cereal rather than bran flakes, I added only about 2/3 c. skim milk, and I replaced the brown sugar with 1/4 c. honey. For being so healthy and low calorie, these muffins were super. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! Such a good alternative to the bran muffins I've been buying at Whole Foods. Added cinnamon and nutmeg as others have suggested. Last time around, I added almond paste just for fun and it was really good! Also increased the baking powder a little to make them fluffier. If you're looking for actual blueberry muffins, these aren't for you. If you're looking for a healthy, lowfat and high fiber treat, these are great. I didn't have apple sauce so I subbed in nonfat yoghurt or a food-processed apple.

these are awesome.  I couldn't find my muffin tins so just baked it as a cake and then cutinto squares. I omitted the white flour and substituted finely ground oats. Also, didn't have apple sauce so I used a thawed banana mushed up. Great flavour and very moist!

Delicious!  I didn't have any wheat bran, but I used some All Bran cereal and they still turned out yummy.  I used dried cranberries once and dried blueberries another time, and added walnuts of course.

This was really good when it came out of the oven, although the bottoms of the paper liners were very wet, causing me to fret over how long these muffins will last before they mold. After a few days, the blueberries turned into a sickish green color, but were okay. It just took away from the enjoyment (I half wanted to throw them away). I think it is best if you eat it out of the oven! Not too sweet, and delicious. I used brown sugar instead of white.

This is a great way to get blueberries and bran into your diet! I also added ground flax. I don't understand the instructions with soaking the bran in milk. No need to do that. Tried it to see if it made a difference and I could see none. First mix wet with wet and the dry with the dry. Since I used frozen berries, I took the advice of adding the berries to the dry mix before combining the wet and dry. Leave berries in freezer until ready to mix.. keeps it from giving that 'swampy' look.

My family loves these muffins.  I made them using old blueberries (you know when they're pretty soft and no flavour) as well as frozen raspberries, changed the vanilla to about two tablespoons of lemon juice, used brown sugar which I decreased by almost half as I used some sweetened raspberry applesauce no one was eating.

Yum yum YUM! I have never found a bran muffin or a low fat muffin I liked until now. I used fresh blueberries, doubled the vanilla, and added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. That was a good call- they had really delicious flavor. I sprayed the muffin pan (nonstick) with cooking spray and floured the liners as well. They just slid right out. They rose well, and they are fluffy and moist. Note: make sure your bran is fresh, because wheat bran goes bad, believe it or not, which can give your muffins a nasty taste. I can't wait to play around with this recipe; I might try it with 80% cocoa chocolate chips or  bananas and walnuts, etc. I wonder how many calories these would be if I substituted Splenda? Hmmm....in any case, thanks for an awesome recipe!

I didn't have any wheat bran, so I used oat bran and some ground flax seed.  Also, instead of AP flour, I sub. rice flour.  I doubled the blueberries as someone suggested, and my husband thought there was way too many.  A very yummy receipe.  Will be making again.

Great muffin. I did follow some of the other recommendations and added only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. They were nice and moist and not overly sweet.

Easy to make. Very healthy. Taste great. Made blueberry the first time and turned out just right. Since then I use splenda in place of the sugar. Use only whole wheat flour and they are just as good. I have left out the blueberry and added cinnamon and raisins and I'm not sure which I like best. There is so much you can do with this recipe. One of the best out there. I have made them many times. They are great with coffee.

This is a great healthy muffin recipe! I used all whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup brown sugar+ 1/3 cup Splenda instead of 2/3 cup brown sugar. I also used oat bran instead of wheat bran, frozen blueberries, and egg subsitute in place of the egg. I ended up with 15 muffins. I just tried a warm one fresh out of the oven and they are pretty good :-)

These muffins are wonderful.  If you are using frozen blueberries, make sure and use the wild blueberries.  They are smaller and make a better presentation.  When making for my 1 & 2 year old girls, I only use whole wheat.  They are more dense but taste better to me.  Of course my husband prefers white flour...or Duncan Hines.

If love the flavour of these! One of the best muffin recipes I've found. I didn't have milk, so I used unsweetened soy milk and egg beaters. Turned out amazing. Very moist.
I read some of the reviews that said to try frozen blueberries. What? I never use frozen fruits in baking, they have absolutely NO flavour at all. I used fresh store-bought blueberries and they were fantastic.

Very good, nutritious muffin recipe.  The muffins didn't rise well and were very moist but I expected that based on the ingredients.  Used 1/3 cup brown sugar splenda instead of brown sugar, unsweetened strawberry/kiwi applesauce instead of regular and buckwheat flour instead of whole wheat flour.  Also added 1 tbsp flax seed to the bran mix.  The muffin was a little sweet for my taste but it could have been from the bran cereal I used.  I let the bran soak in the milk until it was mushy (~ 15min).

Will make again based on the nutritious value alone.  I may try adding protein powder to the mix next time.

Delicious and very moist! Substituted oat bran for the wheat as it was what I had on hand, and used an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries. Will definitely make again!!!

Very good except I did it with fresh chopped apples (same amount) and when I make it again, I would add cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe even ground cloves to give it some seasoning!

These were pretty good, I think that if I make them again I will add some cinnamon or orange zest to give them a bit more flavour

A very simple muffin, and definitely one of the healthiest on allrecipes.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is for the lack of flavour.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Without this, I think the flavour would have been pretty bland, and since it's low-fat, you want to be using lots of flavouring to still "shock" your taste buds.  I also made a few other modifications: (1) I used almond extract instead of vanilla, (2)added a handful of slivered almonds to the batter, (3) used only wheat flour, (4) used Splenda for baking instead of brown sugar (same measurement of 2/3 Cup), and (5) I used 3/4 cup of applesauce to compensate for the moisture of the brown sugar.

I lightly greased the muffin cup pan, but the muffins still stuck a bit, so next time I make them, I will use a silicon muffin pan, which should work great to pop them out of there.  I would not suggest using paper liners, because this recipe is low-fat and you just lose half of your muffin because it sticks to the paper.

I don't know what on earth happened to these muffins, but they weren't anything like the description says.  yummy?  yuk! blagh!!!! i had tried the batter and i knew right then these weren't going to taste as great as everyone else on here seems to think they do.  i was really excited about making them,  since the high fibre -low fat thing is my newest diet.  the only thing i did differently is i used thawed blueberries (cause it's just cheaper that way).  i knew that would've changed the texture and made them a bit more moist.  but that wasn't even the problem.  it was just the taste.  i was expecting it to taste just as good as the ones you buy from a coffee shop, after reading all the reviews on how "great" this recipe is.  i am really disappointed.  i'm rating this recipe 3 stars because i am very impressed with the overall nutrition this gives.  oh well.  i guess i'll keep looking.

Excellent recipe!  Instead of blueberries I used 3 peeled, cored, and chopped Granny Smith apples and added about a tbsp of cinnamon in with the flour mixture.  The batter could have filled more than the 12 cup muffin pan, so I filled each cup to the brim and lowered my oven temp to 350 for about 18 minutes (until muffin top sprang back when touched), they rose perfectly.  I let the muffins cool completely before removing them from the pan to let them set because they were so moist.  My 10 year old son said they were like store bought muffins!

WOW, better then I expected them to be!  I've made other "healthy" muffins before, and none of them tasted as good as this one!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 1 cup wheat germ (I thought I had wheat bran but didn't and wanted to try them so badly!) and 1 cup whole wheat flour. And I agree with others, just the perfect sweetness.  Next time I'll try adding a few oats for texture or a squeeze of lemon, yum! I'll be making these again and again!

I made these for an after school treat for my girls, they were ready to come out of the oven when they got home.  My 10 year old saw the recipe and decided right away that she would not like them.  My 7 year old could not wait to try them.  The verdict is that piping hot out of the oven, they are fantastic(comment from the picky 10 year old.) I doubled the vanilla and the blueberries and made a strusel topping with 1/4c. oats, 1/4c. flour, and 1tbsp margerine to put on top just prior to baking.  Thanks for a great tasting and healthy recipe.

Let's be honest here - these are not anything like a bakery style blueberry muffin, but for something healthy these are definitely tasty! Super moist and filling. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and doubled the blueberries. If you really want a blueberry taste I'd recommend doubling them, or else the bran will overpower everything.

These are not bad for low fat muffins. They took longer to bake than suggested, they lack a sweetness to them, and I too found the bran taste to be overwhelming, although that could be old bran. I would suggest a 1/4 cup of Splenda, or eating them with jam. They were moist though, and looked just like the photo posted, 12 good size muffins. Considering the calorie count on the 'real thing' I'll take these!

I made these muffins using bran cereal instead of wheat bran, 50% calorie reduced becel instead of applesauce and increased brown sugar to 3/4 c. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking. Were very tasty. Made 9 large muffins.

Oh my heavenly goodness!  This was so good that I think it would still be good with less sugar (if you're concerned about calories).  I also used oat bran instead of wheat bran, but I don't know if that made much of a difference taste-wise.  It was about 10 calories more, all up.  Anyway, enjoy, they are delicious!

Great bran muffin recipe- easy to modify for my own needs!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, Egg Beater for the egg, and I used 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  I might try adding a tsp of butter extract for extra flavor next time.  Thanks!

I thought these were pretty good.  I did cut back the sugar since my berries were very sweet.  They had good flavor and texture - almost a little crunchy.  Will make again.

This was good, though it had too many blueberries for my liking. Next time I  will substitute walnuts or pecans for the blueberries. Good tasting, healthy snack.

These muffins are great! Have made them 4 or 5 times in the last two weeks made them with frozen blueberries, substituted berries for bananas and nuts and added flax seeds everytime. Also substituted brown sugar for fructose. Love these, so do all my family and friends.

I am not a big fan of anything made with bran, but my loved ones are, so I made these for them and even I liked them! They were moist, lightly sweet and loaded with blueberries.

easy to make, healthy and taste good.
I only used whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour and they came out great!

This is a lot like a recipe on this site called "Classic Bran Muffins" except this one calls for a 1 cup blueberries instead. These are BOTH delicious recipes. I used 1 cup chopped apples instead of blueberries, buttermilk for the milk & added some Splenda. Moist, chewy & nutritious. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good for healthy muffins, though they didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  I did have to sub oat bran for about a third of the wheat bran (ran out), and used diet vanilla yoghurt instead of the applesauce (again, ran out).  The flavour was lovely and the texture just right (I like a hearty, dense muffin more than the light, airy ones that don't fill you up).  I think next time I'll use a little more baking powder, and make sure I've got enough wheat bran in the house.  I think these would also be nice with some lemon zest to give them a bit of zing.

Not too sweet -- very good "real food" muffin. I used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries, and whet germ instead of bran. Rave reviews from everyone. I will be making these again.

These muffins really were good, you could hardly tell they were low fat. I subbed oat bran for wheat bran, but otherwise kept everything the same. The muffins came out moist and tasty and not too sweet. I'll be keeping this one.

Very tasty.  I substituted 1/4 cup of the bran for 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds (don't tell my husband).  I love how low in fat they are, it feels like you're being naughty by eating them!  I also put in raisins instead of blueberries cuz my husband likes them better, I think I'll make a batch of blueberry ones just for me!

Excellent muffins.  I substituted the Splenda brown sugar blend for brown sugar and used all whole wheat flour instead of just half.  We loved them.  However, I do not recommend using paper cups.  A good percentage of the muffin stays on the paper.   Next time I will simply spray the muffin pans.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very good, healthy muffins. My 4-year old didn't like them but the rest of the family gobbled them up. They are freezable too, I made a big batch and froze half of them.

I made these muffins this afternoon and they smell so good when cooking!  I only made one change to the recipe.  Instead of using blueberries, I used a bag of Sunmaid Cranberries.  The muffins are very, very good.  I definitely plan to keep a batch made up and individually wrap and store them in the freezer.  I love having something to grab and go in the morning on the way to work.  These muffins will be perfect.  A very healthy tasty recipe.
Oh....and I finally found the wheat bran on the organic aisle in my Publix grocery store.

This morning I made a batch of muffins using a slightly revised recipe. To moisten them a bit more, I added a tablespoon of boiling water to the bran at the start of the recipe. I used one full teaspoon of vanilla, and substituted 2/3 cup of oatmeal for the wheat flour. Finally, I threw in half a cup of dried cherries. Simply delicious!

Oh My God, I made these muffins and they were out of this world. I cut the recipe in half(which I do with any new recipe first to try it out)made the recipe as is, only differnce is I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and all whole wheat flour no white.Added extra vanilla cause I love vanilla, and up the baking soda and baking powder alittle more, and some cinnamon for flavor( will use more cinnamon next time) Don't ever feel guilty about eating these muffins.

I followed the changes from BLACKORCHIDINT's review and they were delicious.  I added dried cranberries for colour and flavour.  I served these to visiting family and they were a huge hit.  Will definitely make these again and again.

I couldn't find my old bran muffin recipe so I used this one instead.  These are THE BEST  bran muffins...moist and flavorful.  Made them exactly but left out the blueberries so my kids would eat them.  They are DELICIOUS!  My entire family agrees.

These muffins were amazing!  The texture was moist, the blueberries really added flavour, and best of all: they're good for you!  The only change I would make in the future is to use all whole wheat flour and to maybe put just a half cup of brown sugar.  Otherwise, I'd have to say this is the one of the best recipes for bran muffins that I've ever seen. :)

WONDERFUL! 2 cups All-Bran cereal works well if you don't have wheat bran handy, and mashed bananas make an inexpensive (yet still delicious) alternative to the blueberries.

I made a few changes to this recipe in that I used oil in place of the applesauce, 'fruit medley' frozen berries in place of just blueberries and I used all whole wheat flour instead of half whole wheat and half white flour. I also added the juice of one Clementine to the mixture. I added a pinch extra of both baking powder and baking soda for extra lift with the 100% whole wheat flour.

These muffins were wonderful. They rose beautifully and were light and moist. I doubled the batch, and this made 12 regular sized muffins and 6 Jumbo muffins. The regular sized ones were finished in 20 minutes, and the jumbo muffins took about 25 minutes to be baked completely. 

My children and husband loved these muffins. They wouldn't eat All Bran cereal on its own, so this is a great way for all of us to get the added fiber into our diets. I will most definitely bake these again!

I think these muffins are excellent. I have a batch in the oven as we speak. In fact I make these so often that I keep four premixed containers of dry ingredients on hand to cut down on the prep time later. Thank you for the great recipe!

Oh My Gosh...these muffins are wonderful.  I never thought that applesauce could make such a moist and delicious muffin.  I used applesauce that was sweetned with apple juice, and they turned out great.  Even my husband was like WOW!

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD BRAN MUFFIN RECIPE FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS A WONDERFUL, VERY MOIST MUFFIN. WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN, THEY LOOK LIKE ROCKS. BUT INSIDE THEY ARE VERY MOIST. I DID'NT HAVE ANY BROWN SUGAR OR VANILLA ON HAND, SO I USED HONEY INSTED. AND I HAD BOTH OAT AND WHEAT BRAN. SINCE IT CALLS FOR WHEAT FLOUR I PUT OAT BRAN IN FOR VARIETY. IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MUFFIN TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A TASTY, HEALTHY BRAN MUFFIN.

These recipes are great..nice and moist and taste great.  I added a few of my own ingredients...I doubled the vanilla, added some lemon zest and I didn't have enough wheat bran so I added a half cup of bran flakes they still turned out great and it is hard to believe they only have one gram of fat...will definately make again.

This has a great flavor, and is not as heavy or dry as some bran muffin recipes.  I used a mix of blueberries and raspberries.  Make sure to follow the recipe, I tried to skip the multi-mixing step and the batter turned out a little runny because of it.

These are excellent. I substituted 1 T of vegetable oil for 1 T of the applesauce and used 1 1/4 c. of lowfat buttermilk instead of 1 c. nonfat milk. Best if you let them cool completely! Cooked 22 mins in my slow electric oven.

I am so impressed with this recipe. I added 2tsp of ground flax seed, no salt, used only whole wheat flour and only half a cup of brown sugar and they were awesome.
Thanks for the great recipe, will make them again.

This is great!  Having one right now straight from the oven, so delicious and so moist!  Love the bran/wheat texture and has just the right amount of sweetness.  Would never be able to tell it contains no butter!  Unfortunately, I didn't have blueberries, but it still tastes great.

These muffins are absolutely fabulous! I make a whole batch of them on sunday night and have them for breakfast every morning.  My family loves them as well.  Last sunday i added half a cup of cranberries and half a cup of blueberries and they came out beautifully.  I also always add cinnamon, just to add that bit of spice.  Thanks for this!

These muffins were quite good!  I had recently bought miller's bran and wanted to try a recipe that still had blueberries in it as blueberry muffins are a favorite of mine and my partners.  I modified this recipe just slightly though by using 7 tablespoons of unsweetened apple sauce (rather than 8, which is a 1/2 c.) and 1 tbsp. of cooking oil (enhanced with omega-3's).  I also sprinkled sugar atop the muffins (1 tbsp. for the entire batch).  I ended up making 11 good sized muffins.  Will make again!  Thanks.

I have tried many different lowfat bran muffin recipes, and this is undoubtedly the worst one. In fact, I tried 2 lowfat bran muffin recipes tonight, and the other one was great. It is a moist enough muffin, but extremely bland. I prefer a rich dark brown bran muffin, the kind that is obtained by using molasses. Maybe this recipe would be better with molasses? I won't be trying it again to find out.

I was looking for something for a quick (but still a little healthy) breakfast. Made up ahead of time, these are just that. Blueberries are raved as one of the most healthy foods. Bran and whole wheat are great for fiber and make it substantial. Applesauce and brown sugar give you carbohydrates that help get you going in the morning and adds sweetness. This works for me...   
I used paper liners;they stuck to the muffin more than I would like;so I suggest not using them. I loved the idea of using the "fruit medly" of one reviewer. Although good, the fresh blueberry flavor is a little "lost" with the heavier taste of the whole wheat and bran in this recipe. So, I will try adding other flavors also.
Were done in exactly 15 minutes. I also, will be looking for more recipes by Hilary Lyons. Thank you!

I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and really think I will cut it down to 1/4 cup the next time I make this (wanting result to be more low cal).  I also cut the milk down as it was too much liquid and took too long to bake.  I also added chopped pecans and dried cranberries.  A real family hit!

We need gluten free so I subbed for 1c Pamela’s flour, and GF oat bran instead of wheat.  Everything else exact same.  I baked in shiny light metal tins coated with Wilton cake release, on convect bake 355 for 16 minutes.  Perfect!

these were pretty good.
I made a couple changes because of what I had on hand and to suit need dietary preferences. 
1. I used stevia sweetener and a little molasses to give it the "brown sugar" flavor
2. I used 1 cup sprouted white whole wheat flour
3. I used oat bran instead of wheat bran.
With those adjustments it came to 
111 calories
1.6 grams fat
16 net carbs
4.7 grams protein
Thanks for sharing!

Used silk almond coconut milk vs. regular milk

Used 1/6c brown sugar & 1/6c swerve sugar substitute vs. 2/3 c brown sugar 

Used 2 eggs and omitted apple sauce 

Used 1 cup einkorn whole wheat flour

So good!!!

I used whole milk (ain't no skim milk in my fridge) and, instead of half whole grain and half all purpose flour, I only used Bob's Red Mill whole wheat pastry flour.  And I substituted oat bran for wheat bran.  This was my first time making muffins; I though they would be sweet but they had more of an earthy flavor, which I liked... something good to eat in the morning with plenty of whole grain and low sugar content.

I'm shocked.  The complete lack of fat made me worried.  These are moist, chewy, not too dense, flavorful. 
 
I added a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, because why not?

I must admit that it tastes a lot better than I thought what with all the wheat bran in it. A nice balance of flavours. It's good to have a healthy muffin recipe without a lot of sugar. And I used home-made apple sauce from this site (slow cooker). Both excellent recipes.

I've made them a few times. They really are good! I never have whole wheat flour so I just use all purpose and they turn out well.  We are really trying to cut back on sugar so I didn't add the full 2/3cup and they were still delicious. All in all a great muffin!

Substituted brown sugar with equal parts of coconut sugar, which has a lower glycemic index, or with 1/4 c of honey. Substituted nonfat milk with almond milk. Used 1/2 c of Kodiak Power Cake mix for flour, baking powder

I've only ever had a cranberry orange bran muffin at a hotel continental breakfast and it was terrible.  This muffin is great!  Nice and moist and just the right amount of sweet (although if you add in a titch more brown sugar, it won't hurt!).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious healthy snack for on the go! To lower the fat content a tad I subbed the egg for (2) egg whites and cut down the sugar to a half cup. Tastes great and the blueberry bran combination makes for a hearty little muffin. Will be making these again soon!

I give these muffins an A+! I love these muffins and I will for sure be making them again! I could not stop eating these fantastic muffins! The whole family loved them. I used 2% milk and original apple sauce. That is the only thing I did different. If you like bran and blueberrys, I highly reccomend! 
Thanks for reading!

I had to do a few things differently based on the ingredients I had.  I used whole milk, all purpose flour for the entire cup of flour (no whole wheat) and I used oat bran instead of wheat bran and unsweetened applesauce.  I also used frozen blueberries.  I made one pan of 24 mini muffins and 9 regular sized muffins. These came out moist and perfect!  Yum!  Thank you for the recipe.  I had a similar one I loved and couldn’t find it, but this worked out great so I saved it to my favorites.  Bonus: my two young sons both loved them, too!

10 29 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/52635/low-fat-blueberry-bran-muffins/ ... Don't be a hater, but I had to sub with FiberOne.   Okay, I also subbed oil for the applesauce, but only 1/3c!  :D  There is aspartame in FiberOne & I didn't account for that sweetness when using the full 2/3c brown sugar.  They weren't overly sweet, but if I go that way again, I'd reduce to 1/2c.  These don'taste all that fibery :D - so that means they're likely to be eaten before they become a science project.  Yay!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I ran out of wheat bran so used a mixed grain cereal. It worked out great! I also added a spoonful of coconut oil for a bit of creaminess. Yum!

I would refrigerate these if they're not going to be made the next day, these started tasting bad after just a couple days. I also wouldn't add any more blueberries than the recipe calls for, I added an extra handful and it made portions of the muffins way to soggy. Other than that these tasted great and were easy to make.

These really are moist and amazing. My 2 and 4-year-old gobbled them up. I used all whole wheat flour and omitted the all purpose and they're still quite fantastic!

I made this with the substitution of 1/3 honey for the brown sugar, added pie spice and 1 T ground flaxseed and used 1 mashed banana instead of applesauce.  I also used 1 and 1/2 c blueberries.  Like other reviewers, I highly recommend using more than 1 cup blueberries;  I also find it easier to stir them in if they are frozen.  They hold up better.  My recipe made 12 decent sized muffins baked for around 23-24 minutes.  Very good considering how much better they are for you than anything you can buy in the store.

These muffins came out perfect. I did not sift ingredients or mix milk first and let sit for 10 minutes. I am not lazy, just in a hurry at the time. I added a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and cinnamon as someone previously mentioned. 
Very happy with these muffins,will continue to make them over and over again.
Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I have found my new favourite muffin recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written except adding a tsp of cinnamon. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup as suggested as I found these muffins a little sweet.

I woke up this morning with a yankering for blueberry muffins.  These were quick and easy.  I didn't have regular applesauce, so used unsweetened blueberry.  Cooked about 25 minutes and they were perfect.  Not overly sweet and delicious!  Will definitely make again!

I am a connoisseur of bran muffins of sorts since they are always my first choice when I go to a bakery that sells them.  I just made this recipe with wild Maine blueberries and they were to die for! Moist and flavorful--just yummy. This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't have applesauce but I did have apples so I just made my own. (Added cinnamon to the apples while they were simmering) Also used 2% milk rather than skim and the fresh blueberries I had on hand. This recipe made 12 good sized amazing muffins! Definitely will make them again.

First time around, muffins came out great!  Subsequent batches, ran into the middle not being fully cooked.  Substitutions, instead of brown sugar, I used splenda brown sugar and tin foil muffin cups.

My hubby and I love these muffins!  They are moist, not too sweet, and taste fabulous.  I make them as per the recipe except that I almost double the vanilla and add almost a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I also  fill the paper cups full to make bigger muffins - we usually get about 9 from a batch.

We thought these were pretty good.  We love to try health muffin options and love when bran is included.  These baked up very nice and were very moist without being dense.  My only complaint is that they weren't very sweet and I don't know that blueberries are my favorite in here.  I think I would like to try maybe making these with some apples and cinnamon.

Made these a second time using apples (about 1.5) and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and I thought they were great.

I did make a couple little additions.  I added about a tbsp.  of orange rind, 1/4 cup of raisins and dried cranberries with 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries to equal 1 cup per the recipe.  I used a large muffin tin of 6 and baked them for about 30 minutes. They turned out absolutely delicious, moist and full of great flavour :)

I used All Bran Buds cereal and was worried about the texture, but they turned out great and I actually like the bumpy look the little balls gave the muffins.  They could be a bit sweeter for my taste so maybe next time I'll add a little more brown sugar?

I was looking for a healthy, tasty muffin for something to snack on, and this definitely fulfills the criteria.  I followed some of the comments, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and instead of wheat bran (which I couldn't find in the grocery store), I used all-bran flakes in the milk. It turned out really great! The only thing is that I put them in the oven for a full 20 minutes and they're still kind of mushy... So for next time I will definitely be leaving them in a little longer. Overall, great muffin though!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for - a healthier bran muffin using basic ingredients that I have on hand. Nice and moist. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, but only because I add cinnamon to almost everything I bake that uses whole wheat flour.

I was looking for a bran muffin recipe that didn't call for buttermilk and this was one of the few that i found. It was very dry when i mixed it together, i had to add an extra splash of milk, and when they were done baking they were much drier than any other bran muffin ive ever made. Theyre also just plain, not good, in the flavor department. I realize that they're low fat but that shouldn't be an excuse.

I made these exactly as written and they turned out very well. I froze them for quick breakfasts and one out of two kids will eat them, which is pretty good of you ask me. The only thing lacking was the density I so loved from my Grandma's bran muffins, but I'm betting that was a concession for the low-fat. *sigh*. Regardless, these are a repeater for sure!

I made these lovely muffins today and they came out nothing like the photo. Mine look like straight raisin-brand muffins (dark and bran-full). I used frozen blueberries and the outcome is moist and tasty. Not too sweet even though I upped the sugar a bit based on what other reviews suggested. All in all I like this muffin and will likely make again soon (with fresh blueberries this time).

Big hit with the family.  Loved the boost of fiber that is hidden well in this super moist muffin.  No fat added, just the right amount of sweetness and burst of blueberry flavor. My husband's golf buddies said I could bake a snack for them anytime.

Really really good. I replaced the apple puree with mashed banana, purely because we didn't have apple, and added cinnamon, the whole family loved them. Very moist and soft.

These are outstanding. For bran muffins, they have a great texture - not mealy like bran muffins can be. Next time I might cut back on the sugar a bit, as they were pretty sweet. The kids loved them - Will definitely make these again.

I couldn't find oat bran so I substituted one cup of oatmeal and as another review suggested, I substitued 1/4 cup honey for the brown sugar and added a little cinnamon.  They turned out moist and tasted ok, not sure if I'd make them again, they're edible but not terrific.

I made these for a quick healthy breakfast to have in the mornings before work. I must admit..these DO taste healthy...but knowing that it hardly has fatty junk in it, makes me feel much better about eating it. My husband who is NOT a health nut by any means will also pop a couple. Top with a dab of brummel and brown spread and its pretty delish. I added oats in place of white flour. I made them in cupcake molds and wrapped them individually and froze them. I take one out the freezer and nuke it for 45 seconds and its just like fresh!

A very healthy snack.  I tried adding the banana instead of apple sauce as one person suggested.  I also added cinnamon and broken up reeses peanut butter cups (I know, not as healthy).

This was a really great recipe, I made a batch of blueberry bran following Laura's substitutions--they turned out amazing, infact I couldn't even tell that they were low calorie.  So I took it one step further, again I followed Lauren's substitutions but this time I substituted the blueberries with 1 cup of dark chocolate chips.  I don't know how to calculate the calories but they were fantastic!

I give these muffins a 4 star.  I am not too much of a bran fan but these hit the spot.  They are moist and fluffy for a bran muffin and there is no fat in them.  They are easy to make and a great on the run breakfast.  I put a little honey on mine.   I will make again.

These are AMAZING. Even my mom loved them, and she's hesitant about anyone elses baking other than her own. The muffins were indeed very moist, sweet, and best of all, healthy. I only had one cup of bran, so I substituted the last 1/2 with ground flax. SO SO SO GOOD! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were great. I changed a few things. I used Splenda instead of brown sugar, only used whole wheat flour and used apple/pomegranate sauce. My son is diabetic which is why I used splenda but they tasted fine. Make sure you really grease your pans because the blueberries will stick to the bottom and you will have to dig them out!

Great base recipe that I could change up to suit my needs. I had to make a lot of substitutions to cut back on sugar and include all whole wheat. Thanks for sharing.

good recipe - the reason why i gave it 4 stars is because i could hardly taste the muffin itself with all the blueberries.  next time i make it i'll probably halve the amount of blueberries.

Oh my gosh, this recipe is amazing!  I used 1/3 cup of Splenda brown sugar (which is twice as sweet) and I didn't have apple sauce so I replaced it with 1/3 cup of plain nonfat yogurt and 1 1/2 T of oil. These muffins were marvelous!

Really good! Did not have any wheat bran, so instead increased white and wheat flour to 2/3 c. each. Also, added about 1/4 c. of wheat germ. Batter was a little runny and I may increase the dry ingredients a bit more next time. Even still, muffins turned out great.

We did not like these muffins.  The bran was grainy (maybe needed more liquid to soak) and 1c of blueberries overloaded the muffins so there wasn't enough batter to keep them from falling apart while eating them.

I changed these slightly and they were great.  i DID NOT use baking soda.  And i used 2 cups of wheat bran instead of adding the 1/2 cup of white flour.  I also used cranberries instead of blueberries.  They were great!  They did not bulk up as much, but they were very fluffy in texture.  i think because of the extra oat bran instead of flour.

Was not expecting a bran muffin to be this tasty, moist, and satisfying.  I used all wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.  Also added 1/2 cup of blueberries.  To me, these are best when fully cooled the next day.  Yum!  I'm ready to try these with craisins.

What a great muffin! It's so easy to make, add in that it's low fat and perfectly sweet enough. I had to use frozen blueberries, but I really don't think it made a difference. If you do use frozen, do not thaw them before adding to the batter. This is by far my favorite muffin!

Really great recipe!!  I didn't have any plain applesauce, so I used Mott's blueberry applesauce. The lunch cup's are the perfect measurement. I also add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of ground flax, and substituted 1/2 the blueberries for frozen raspberries. A nice quick recipe, that I will be making over and over again.

One minor improvement to an already wonderful and healthy recipe ... I substituted a 2/3 cup mixture of 1 part honey and 1 part vegetable oil for the 1/2 cup applesauce.  I found the flavour a little bland and the muffins slightly dry with just the 1/2 cup applesauce.  It bumps up the calories and fat per muffin ever so slightly ... but they are much more moist and just the right amount sweeter.  So unless you're on a strict calorie watch, I'd go for the extra taste.

These were tasty.  They were actually a lot lighter/fluffier than what I expected considering all the bran fiber and the whole wheat flour used.  I subbed part of the wheat bran with flax for more Omega-3s.

These are a fantastic treat as written; however, I have made some modifications for my own taste: I sub soymilk instead of milk, reduce brown sugar to 1/2 cup, omit the vanilla extract and use all (1 cup) whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat & all purpose.  After baking, I sprinkle the tops with a little white sugar and allow to cool.  Make sure to store these in the fridge; they have a short shelf-life due to how moist they are after baking.

These blueberry muffins were delicious.  Didn't miss the fat.  I didn't have wheat bran so I substituted half whole wheat and half all purpose flour for the wheat bran and the muffins came out delicious.  Actually taste better when cooled completely or the next day rather than warm out of the oven.

Taste was a bit flat, I didn't care for the spongy texture either. Won't make these again.

Really, really good. And so healthy and easy. The first time I made them I accidentally left out the applesauce and they still turned out moist and delicious. When I followed the recipe exactly, they were perfect. Although they were by no means overly sweet, I might reduce the sugar a little next time just to see how they turn out. I like to cut back sugar if I can. They would also be wonderful with raspberries. These muffins will definitely be a breakfast staple at my house.

These are great. I made Muffin Tops and I put them in the toaster at work and they get nice and crispy all the way around.

My whole family loved this-- and they don't usually take to my efforts of "healthy" baking. My dad said that this needs to be a "stapel" in our house :). Thanks!!! And the nutrition values are fantastic!

Fantastic recipe!  Not too sweet, and definitely more work than just throwing blueberry muffin mix into a pan, but these are a really healthy way to have a great muffin!

I usually don't like the taste of "low fat" foods but these are delicious! I think the fresh blueberries make this recipe. I couldn't find wheat bran in the store, so I used original All Bran cereal instead. Eat them warm with butter. Oh yum. I'm going to go eat another one now.

This was bland, not sweet enough, didn't cook properly and way too healthy...I wouldn't have baked it if I had realized beforehand that there was not fat...if you're on a diet, don't waste your time with these muffins...

A great healthy muffin that was easy to make and came out nice and moist.  A few mods from other reviews: 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 and 1/2, added 1/4 tsp to the baking powder and baking soda, All-bran cereal instead of wheat bran, and frozen mixed berries in place of blueberries (though I would think any fruit would work nicely).

Seriously great muffins!  I followed the recipe except I used All Bran cereal (instead of wheat bran), half cup brown sugar, one and a half cups blueberries. I was very skeptical about using applesauce in place of oil, but you will never miss it. These muffins are moist and delicious. I look forward to tomorrow when I can have another! Yum-O!

These are fantastic! I am always skeptical when it comes to low fat muffins. They always look good but never turn out that way. Not these! I found them delicious. They also freeze well.

I'm always sorry when I am dissappointed in a recipe so well liked by other reviewers. I had a couple of friends over last night for dinner and baking, one thought they were good but chewy, one thought they were 'ok', and I frankly wouldn't make them again. The only substitute I made was 1/2 cup honey for the brown sugar, as previously suggested. Sorry.

I made these twice now, once following the recipe exactly and once with several modifications. My first batch were good, but too sweet for my liking. I used a little less than 1/2 of a cup of brown sugar the second time as well as used all whole wheat flour. The second batch turned out great. I may use even less sugar next time. But, nonetheless great, great recipe! Thank you for sharing.

This is the first bran muffin I ever made. I used wheat bran and substituted crushed pineapple for the applesauce because I had just opened a can and thought, why not? They were pretty tasty and just the right sweetness, however I found out I am not a big fan of bran. I am trying to get more fiber in my diet, but I don't think this is how I am going to do it. I dont' think I will make them again.

I made these muffins tonight. They came out absolutely perfect, and smelt heavenly. I only made two substitution in this recipe: instead of using a full egg (white and yolk) I used two egg whites cutting the fat content to a even lower level, I also used 3/4 of a cup of large fresh blueberries and 1/4 cup of frozen blueberries. I was fearful that they would come out dry due to the lack of fat in the recipe, but they ended up coming out moist and filled with blueberry-goodness. This is a great low-fat recipe.

This is now a staple in my house! They are really yummy for a low fat muffin. Perfect for a breakfast muffin, not too sweet, heavy or too many calories.  I have made them adding raspberries for a mixed berry and sometimes I make them with banana and walnuts instead of berries   LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

I've made these several times and love them. They are a delicious, filling and healthy breakfast or snack.  I don't usually stock whole wheat flour so I added extra all purpose flour as a substitute. Otherwise I followed the original recipe.

i used several suggested changes: i used only baking powder, all wheat flour, and added some cinnamon. i would like to use egg beaters next time, but these are really wonderful. everyone gobbled them up, even my 6 year old and my one year old. i will make them again and again. thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic muffins - totally exceeded my expectations. The batter looked a little gross, but they come out looking and tasting great! Wonderful addition to my breakfast.

I make these and eat 2 for breakfast with yogurt and a banana.  I don't use sugar, I add a banana instead and I use all wheat flour. I also am know on occasion to forget the blueberries when shopping so I use a 1/4 cup of raisins when in a pinch and they are just as good. Yummy

Yummy!  I had to substitute the wheat/bran for all bran cereal soaked in the milk.  Very good muffins and good for you too! The low fat and high fibre content with the whole wheat flour, all bran and blueberries is fantastic!

these came out very good.  I didn't have applesauce so I added yogurt for moisture - just perfect. I also added some flax to make them extra healthy.

(update 4/12/09) i used blueberries this time and it was much better.  still very sticky, so paper cups don't work well, but much more tasty. (old, 2 star) i used only white flour, added some cinnamon, and used golden raisins instead of blueberries.  the consistency was somewhat rubbery, and i didn't like the golden raisins.  will try again with blueberries.

I had no blueberries on hand so I made these with raisins and flax instead. I used 1/2 cup mashed banana for the applesauce, and all whole wheat flour. Really great!

Yum yum!  These are great, moist, and very tasty.  I added lots of berries, which kept them even more moist!  I am currently doing weight watchers, and at 3 points for 2 muffins, they are a great breakfast! Will definitely make again.

This is a great muffin.  Used some of the suggestions right off the bat.  I substituted 1 mashed banana for the apple sauce, used half of the amount of brown sugar and about a 1/6 cup of honey, used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and omitted the all-purpose flour, and upped the baking powder and soda each to 1 1/4 tsp.  Very tasty and moist, I will definitely make this again and will continue to place with this recipe, maybe some chopped apples, dried cranberries...the possibilities are endless!

Just made these and the only changes were using cinnamon flavored applesauce and buttermilk. They were great. The problem I always have with non-fat muffins is that they stick to the paper liners.

Great tasting and very healthy!  I used flax powder mixed with water for an egg substitute and substituted some of the sugar for honey to make it healthier.  I also used low-fat buttermilk instead of just regular milk.

Excellent, moist muffins.  I don't care for blueberries so I just substituted raisins.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a T and they are the best!

these are good. I used vanilla soymilk instead of milk and I used one cup of WW flour as opposed to half WW and half AP flour.   The first time I made these, I used blueberries. The blueberries burst and made the muffin soggy and did create an ugly green color.  The second time, I used mini chocolate chips and the muffin wasn't soggy and was delicious! Granted, it's not as healthy, but it was yummy!

This recipe is awesome! I made a few adjustments: I used two ripe mashed bananas instead of milk; I added 1 cup of museli as well as dark chocolate chunks and I used cranberries instead of blueberries. I also used our homemade apple sauce and they turned out great!

Great!!!  My husband was afraid to try them because they are healthy but we both loved them.  I doubled the blueberries and discovered that you can actually have too many blueberries but other than that they were surprisingly delicious.

I started out with this prepared for a flop - I was in for a surprise! These are INcredible! I used the tip for a bit more baking powder and added in the grated carrots and extra blueberries. They were moist and delicious and GONE in two days... definitely a shock for me, since when I try to cook healthily I'm usually shot down by my three hockey-player brothers. Fortunately I kept the healthy aspect hush-hush and they were thoroughly enjoyed :) I'll definitely be making these again.

These are excellent for a low-fat muffin.  My husband usually refuses my "low-fat" baked recipes, but these were a hit in his book.  The only change I made was to add cut up peaches instead of blueberries as I had peaches to use.  Will try the blueberries next time.

I followed the directions directly as written.  These muffind were very bland, and had no sweetness at all.  I hate that I went and bought wheat flour and bran just to make this recipe.  I will admit that maybe my expectations were too high.

These muffins are super easy and taste great.  I followed the recipe exactly and they come out moist and fluffy.  They freeze well and I think this recipe will lend itself to a lot of different variations.  I am going to try pumpkin pie filling and pumpkin pie spice next for an autumn twist!  Definitely try this recipe if you are looking for a healthy breakfast on the go!

Great for a healthy muffin recipe.  I've made the recipe as written and it turned out great.  I've also made apple cinnamon muffins by using one chopped apple and 1 tsp cinnamon.  These also turned out just as well.

These were really good and definitely moist!  I used All-Bran for the wheat bran.  My husband and I really liked these, but they just were not quite 5-star worthy.

Excellent! Always looking for healthier choices for snacking. Made a couple changes- didn't have brown flour, so used 3/4 c white and 1/4 c ground flax. Also added allspice and nutmeg and increased the amount of blueberries, though had a couple issues as used mini muffin pans, so if there were too many blueberries, they'd break in half coming out of the tin. Excellent recipe. Husband loved it and will continue to use.

healthy but not cooked throughout- but mushy inside.  Cooked downstairs- could be the oven... cooked at too high of a temperature??

These muffins are so healthy as well as very good. They are also very easy to make!  I made them with WW flour, and added a mashed banana.  I also used All-Bran cereal and added some gluten. This recipe makes about a dozen and 1/2, too!  I will definitely make them again!

Very Good especially for low fat and healthy!! Followed another review in beating egg white before adding, and muffins are light and have great texture! Perfect amount of sweetness.  Will make again for sure!

I was expecting these muffins to be so good based on the other reviews - but was very disappointed by the taste. They were very moist, but I did not like the taste at all.

These are delicious! As some other people, I didn't have applesauce so I used a banana. I also used eggbeaters instead of an egg. I highly recommend these!

Very tasty and healthy. I doubled the recipe and only put in one cup, of brown sugar, accidentially missing 1/3 cup.  They still tasted great.

I made a few changes to this recipe.
I used 1 cup of bran cereal (Post 100% Bran) and added the 1 cup of milk. Instead of waiting 10 minutes. I used a hand blender to puree it.

When I added the bran puree to the rest of the ingredients I also added 1/2 cup of rolled oats (large).

I switched the 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of yogurt (it was all I had).

I used all wheat bran flour instead of half and half also.

I used 1 cup of Europe's Best 4-Field Berry mixture instead of just blueberries and I pressed an apple chunk into the top of each muffin before baking.

They seem to have turned out fairly well. Not too sweet at all.

As from a previous review, I substituted one mashed banana over the applesauce. Then I used dried cranberries rather than blueberries and added 1/3 cup of unsalted sunflower seeds. A terrific mid-morning, post-workout snack!

One note: it took nearly 25 min for the muffins to bake thoroughly.

Even my white flour-, full fat-loving family loved these whole grain muffins. They were very moist and just sweet enough to be a treat. The instruction about tapping the muffin top to see if it bounces back is a good indication of when it's done. It took 25 minutes for my batch of muffins to reach that stage. The only changes I made were to increase the vanilla to 1 t, substitute plain yogurt since I didn't have applesauce, and substitute frozen wild blueberries. I think the smaller berries make tastier muffins since they distribute more evenly throughout the muffin instead of the few, giant blobs of blueberry that occur when I used the regular-sized ones. Plus, wild blueberries have more antioxidants. I will be making these muffins regularly for breakfast.

These are great!  Very impressed in this recipe, as I have tried a few other healthy muffin recipes and they are typically pretty dull.  I used eggbeaters in place of the egg and Splenda brown sugar mix instead of regular... turned out great.  My new favorite healthy recipe!

These were really delicious and so healthy! I made them exactly as the recipe specified. (Which I believe is what you should do if you are going to give a valid review). I did spray my muffin pan. I used frozen blueberries. I will make these again and again.

I don't like to give 5 stars, but honestly, this is my second of the night.  Way to go on a low fat alternative for us bread/cake cravers!  Loved them!!  (I followed the mashed banana suggestion!)

These turned out great. I sprayed my muffin tins well and they did not stick. To make them appetising for my children I used two mashed bananas in place of the apple sauce, upped the sugar to one cup and threw in some chocolate chips - probably not so healthy but very tasty. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of wholemeal flour as the mixture seemed a bit wet. Next time I will try them with blueberries for me.

These were excellent and so healthy!! My husband who usually cringes when I try to feed him something healthy really liked these too. I did add about 1/8 cup of honey and a dash of cinnamon and I thought they were just sweet enough. Also - I noticed some people saying they had a problem with the muffins sticking, so I sprayed the muffin cups lightly with cooking spray and I had no problem. I will most definitely make them again.

I love them, however my husband likes the very sweet box mix better.  These are not too sweet which makes them perfect for breakfast.  I used frozen berries which made them almost too moist.  I also tried apples and that came out very moist as well.  I think raisens are the best mix-in.

Great recipe!

I made mini muffins out of this recipe that are quite scrumptious!

Few modifications I made. I used oat bran instead of wheat bran, ditched the all-purpose flour and used all wheat flour, put in splenda as a substitute for the sugar, added a pinch more baking soda, and a little more blue berries.

Great recipe!!! :)  I was so happy to find this healthy recipe.  As others did, I doubled the recipe and used all Whole Wheat flour.  Plus, I used Light Soy Milk as well (allergy!) and they turned out great!  I think that next time I am going to try the oat bran suggestion and see which I like better.

My favorite muffin recipe so far!  I get away with 1/2 cup brown sugar since the applesauce adds sweetness (sometimes I add a bit more).  Definitely worth it!

WOW!! These muffins were so easy to prepare. I was surprised at how moist they were, and they were bursting with blueberries. I made them for my boyfriend for breakfast and he raved about them. I even made an extra batch so he could take home and have breakfast for the week! lol. They were a HIT!

Wow! I usually do not like bran muffins, but trying find an alternatve healthy snack I gave it a shot. These definitely stopped the cake-like craving and filled me up too. I only switched to all whole wheat flour. Thanks for the calorie count calculations. Next time, I will try with chocolate chips and sub a banana for the applesauce, as suggested, to satisfy the chocolate craving.

As an American expat abroad, finding ingredients for recipes written in English is usually a challenge. I wasn't able to find a few of the ingredients called for, but after seeing that this recipe was successfully modified by others, I decided to give it a shot.
Instead of the bran, I used crushed All Bran flakes cereal, soaked in 1.5% milk. I used 2 crushed over-ripe bananas instead of applesauce (I would have had to make it myself, and I wasn't in the mood for that this morning). Instead of brown sugar, I filled a 1/2 cup measure with a combination of maple syrup, white sugar, and splenda - one third of each. I used 1/2 cup of wild Norwegian blueberries (these are very small and bleed out easily) and a handful of dried cranberries. 
One thing I would change is to make the muffins smaller, so they are thoroughly cooked in the middle. In the second batch I made, I added a streusel topping, as I didn't have enough batter left for full-sized muffins. These were lovely! I made the streusel with oatmeal, maple syrup and a light olive-oil margerine.
Definitely recommend these muffins!

Ok, this muffin is what is keeping me on a diet.  I tried diets where you snack on nuts and other grains, but they weren't my thing.  My thing is anything cake-like or breadish.  These are delicious and much better than the rock solid health food store muffins.  The fiber and low cal qualities of this recipe make it a staple in my house.  I have to admit though, the kids don't care for them but I like them enough to make them just for me.

Fabulous recipe. I used fresh blueberries and frozen raspberries. Also I added cinnamon. I soaked wheat germ in milk as i didn't have any wheat bran. Worked out perfectly, is there a difference in bran and germ? Also I doubled the recipe which made 28 muffins. To help rise I used SR flour and added Baking soda and Baking powder. Will make again for sure!

For a bran muffin, this came out great. It was very soft and moist and had just the right amount of sweetness...definitely noticeable but not overpowering. Followed recipe exactly.

This must be a very forgiving recipe:  I didn't have a lot of what was called for, so I substituted a lot.  I used wheat bran cereal and 2% milk.  Since all I had was sweetened applesauce, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (used Splenda).  Since I didn't have blueberries, I used a few raisins.  And for good measure, I threw in some chopped pecans.  I'm betting the original recipe makes an even better muffin--can't wait to try it after I go shopping!

I LOVE these muffins...and so does my husband and three kids...which says a lot!      The best part is that they are healthy and only 2 points for those of us on Weight Watchers.

For what these are - a healthy blueberry muffin - they are excellent - hearty, moist and a good amount of sweet.  And I know they're good because my fiance who is always poo-pooing my health versions of food, actually loved them and asked to take some to work (this is a big deal).  The only alteration I made was to double the blueberries.

I didn't have wheat bran, so I ended up using oat bran, wheat germ and flaxseed meal for a substitution. Very good. My husband calls them the "blueberry butt bombs" due to all the fiber in them.!!

These were awesome!  So tasty and so easy to prepare.  They really do taste like a "real" muffin, not a health food store type baked product.  They are very flavorful and moist.  I did find however that they stuck to the muffin cups, so next time I will just use non-stick spray in the muffin pan and skip the paper cups.  Thanks!

I think this is the best healthy muffin recipe I ever tried! I used All Bran flakes cereal instead of wheat bran and only used whole wheat flour and it worked just as well! I also did a variation using cranberries and cranberry-apple sauce. Delicious!

I love these muffins. I have used the basic recipe with lots of variations: Oat bran instead of wheat bran, banana or plain yogurt for apple sauce, and dried cranberry or raisen for blueberry. Also recommend fresh ginger. Always turn out great!

I have made these twice now with small variations and loved them both times.    The first time I grated in some carrot, which made them sweeter and denser, but was a lot of work because I was grating baby carrots with a microplane!  The second time I used raspberries instead of blueberries and added some chopped walnuts.  I really like them with the raspberries and walnuts.  Also, I used the brownsugar blend by splenda both times.

Excellent muffin.  I made them once with heavy cream, to try and get the preschooler to eat them.  They were awesome, of course not low fat though.  I also do not mix the berries in, I place them into the batter once in muffin cups.  Quick to make.

I did not find these muffins to be as soft and moist and regular blueberry muffins.  They are far more dense and I found the bran overwhelmed the taste of the muffin.  If you are looking for a healthier alternative to a regular blueberry muffin and don't mind the taste of bran this is not a bad muffin and it is very filling; it just doesn't taste like a blueberry muffin.

Very good will make these again!!  I did make a few changes, used 1/2 tsp almond extract, 4 oz of cherry yogurt instead of applesauce, and chopped frozen cherries.  When using frozen berries of any sort I always dust them with alittle flour and sugar before adding to the batter.  Next time I might add some chopped pecans too.  My kids loved them and I love the fact they have over 4 gms of fiber per muffin!!

These muffins are great and very moist.  I used 1/2 cup, instead of 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 teaspoon vanilla instead of 1/2 teaspoon and added chopped apples.  The muffins turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.

These muffins were excellent!  I love bran muffins and these are no exception.  I added a few dashes of cinnamon and forget he vanilla...oops.  They still came out so moist and tasty.  I used frozen blueberries dusted in flour so they wouldn't run.  I highly recommend these.

This recipes easily gets 5 stars!  It was simple to make and both my kids loved them! These stayed really moist too. I've made these several times and changed the blueberries to dried apricots and a few handfuls of dark chocolate chips...YUMMY!  A healthy alternative to pre-packaged granola bars.....Thanks so much!

I love these. My 1-year old too. and my 31-year-old. (hubby) I added a little less than 1/3 cup molasses to replace some sugar and did not add applesauce because I didn't have any. I couldn't find wheat bran, so put oat bran instead, I LOVE the smell!!!

I just made these and they are very, very good!! I should have listened to the other reviews and added more sugar or some cinnamon as the muffins were a tiny bit plain, but overall I'd say these are the best bran muffins I have ever had. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this recipe a five star, these are the best lowfat bran muffins I've tasted.  They taste great, they're moist, and they look like real muffins.

Very very moist and rich tasting muffins, also very filling. One with a piece of fruit would be a nice breakfast. I added a couple dashes of cinammon and doubled the vanilla, also increased b. sugar to 3/4 cup. Thanks for a great muffin recipe.

For being so low-fat these were very very moist.  If you like nuts, please add some toasted nuts.  Despite the 3/4 cup brown sugar, they are hardly sweet, but that can be compensated for in texture.

These were just ok.  I was expecting them to be really, really good based on all the reviews.  We probably won't be able, or willing, to eat all of them before they go bad.

For a healthy muffin, these are delicious.  I was suprised how moist these turned out, all the previous "healthy" muffins I've tried are dry and bland.  I did make a few changes: 3/4 cup Fiber One (chopped fine), 3/4 cup wheat germ (instead of 1 1/2 cups wheat bran)
I used vegetable oil instead of applesauce; I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar and added 1 packet of regular spenda.  I also used 1 1/2 cups blueberries instead of just 1 cup...the more the merrier!!  Minor changes and the muffins were still a huge hit with my husband.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I was quite disappointed with the way these muffins came out. They simply didn't taste good, not like real bran muffins. They weren't awful, just not very good. My mother did like them a lot, though.

I really liked these. They reminded me of our usual bran muffin recipe but without all the oil. The only problem was they stuck to the muffin cup. I might just try them in the tin next time. Very moist!

Mmmm, delicious!  I just made some of these and they are moist and wonderful!  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 Cups of frozen blueberries, and topped them with a lemon glaze.
Don't expect a cakey muffin as these have a healthy bran taste to them but they are absolutly delicious!

These muffins are amazing!!!!!  I didn't have any applesauce on hand so i substituted prune puree (leftover babyfood) and i didn't have any blueberries so i added 2 handfuls of raisins.  As well i used all whole wheat flour.  Sooooo good, i can't believe its so healthy!!  Will be making these all the time!

These are excellent muffins!  Can't believe they are so low in fat and yet so moist.  I used All Bran cereal and subbed pureed prunes from the baby food aisle for the applesauce.  My berries were still partially frozen when I mixed them into the batter, but the batter was dense enough to keep them from all sinking to the bottom.  I froze most of them and will eat one every morning for breakfast.  A delicious way to get that very necessary fiber into the diet!  Do not hesitate to try these!!!

This is a keeper!  The substitutions I made (only cause I didn't have the right ingredients) were that I used low-fat sour cream instead of the applesauce, regular milk instead of skim, and Raisin Bran(picked out the raisins) instead of wheat bran.  I also used all whole wheat and extra blueberries.  They turned out delicious, although probably not as low fat due to the sour cream.  Next time I'll try making them by the recipe, but these muffins are excellent!!

I made these with banana's instead of the blueberries.  They were a BIG hit with my 8 yr. old son.  They are very filling and low fat.  I will make again and again.

Great Recipe.  I used all whole wheat flour and added some extra blueberries to the batch.  I made them on Friday and thought they would be ok to take to work on Tuesday but I was wrong.  They got moldy fast, I would suggest putting in freezer and taking them out the night before if you want them for work or breakfast.  Thanks for the good recipe.

My family is divided on these muffins. My 14 year old and I really like them but my husband and younger child said they were gross. I used wheat flour and not all-purpose and Egg Beaters instead of an egg.I coated the blueberries with flour before adding them to the mixture, it's supposed to keep them from sinking. One of these muffins is only 2 points for Weight Watchers.

Great muffins!  I've made them twice so far, following the recipe exactly.  My kids think these muffins taste even better than 'regular' blueberry muffins, so that says a lot!

Nice and moist.  I substituted 1/2c soy flour for the wheat flour, cut blackberries and almonds for the blueberries, and soy milk for the nonfat milk.  They had to bake for closer to 25-30 min at 375 but were a hit!  I think I might try apples with some cinnamon and nutmeg next time, but it's a great basic recipe to play around with.

I thought this recipe was good. It was very moist, but it did lack that flavor punch. I would add a little cinnamon and nutmeg next time. It's definetly worth making and the good thing is that you can ajust here and there. I'd make them again.

I didn't have apple sauce so i used plain yogourt instead, they were delicious! Very moist and tasty. I added raisins and pecans instead of blueberries. Might try adding a little cinnamon next time.

I followed this recipe to the letter and they turned out great.  You'd never say they were low-fat.  My boyfriend and daughter love them.

These were great.  I only put in half the sugar, left out the salt and didn't put any blueberries in because I didn't have any.  I love muffins and like the fact that these are low fat and filling!

This is an absolutely incredible recipe.  Thanks so much!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and upped the baking powder and baking soda.  I also used some cinammon and used only 1/2c of sugar.  Also substituted 1 tblspn of vegetable oil for the applesauce. You must make these muffins and you don't even feel bad about eating them!  YUM!

These are really great. My 3 year old needs extra fiber in her diet and she loves these. Also, I recommend freezing some because they come out of the freezer and are just as good as straight out of the oven!

These muffins are delicious!  I would try making them with a little less applesauce because they were almost too moist.

I followed to recipe & they turned out great!  They got a little mushy after a few days (the wheat bran) - I haven't baked w/ wheat bran enough to know if this is normal.  Overall, v. tasty & healthful muffins.
