BEST sugar cookie recipe ever. Excellent taste...almost melts in you mouth. I did use European butter, which probably helped! Easy recipe!

The taste was great, however my feeling is that sugar cookies should be crispy chewy.  These definitely were not, actually they were borderline soggy.  I followed the recipe using butter, not margarine or softening.  still on the search for the perfect sugar cookies

I made the dough exactly as instructed and the it was perfect and tasted fantastic. Our daughter did dinosaur cut outs for her son's birthday party and everyone really enjoyed them!
