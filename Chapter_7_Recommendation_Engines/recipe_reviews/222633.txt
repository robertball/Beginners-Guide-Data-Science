Simple, but tasty.  Added a little oregano as well. Used the sauce on "Deep-Dish Cast Iron Pizza" from allrecipes.

Can't believe I've never made pizza sauce from scratch before.  SO easy!  This recipe is delicious!!  I subbed what I had on hand, diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, dried basil.  (mashed up with potato masher after cooking awhile)  Did add oregano and extra garlic. Can't wait to try this with San Marzano tomatoes!

I made as instructed above.
Personally I love garlic and felt that 3 cloves didn't stand up to the 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes, so I made it 5-6 cloves.
Also, I recommend 3-6 pinches of sugar to balance it out the acids from the tomatoes. It makes a big difference.Don't overdo it though.
Lastly- make sure the canned tomatoes are of high quality. Pastene brand Italian tomatoes are my favorite. In the North End in Boston the owner of my favorite restaurant said, "It's all about the tomatoes".

This is a great base for any sort of tomato sauce, need a marinara? Add some onion and wine. Spaghetti sauce? add some tomato paste, and some sugar. It's a great starting point for all things tomatoey! It also stands up to a great deal of tinkerability.

This has a wonderful flavor.  I also liked the chunks of tomatoes on my pizza.  I thought that the sauce was thin so I cooked it on a very low setting for the about a hour while my pizza crust was processing.  I used it on the Cast-iron Pizza from this site.  It was perfect.

I made it as directed and found it a little bland. I then added 3 more cloves of garlic, tablespoon of oregano and 3 more leaves of fresh basil and  because we like our sauce a little on the sweet side a tablespoon of sugar.  I only had a can of diced tomatoes so I used my immersions blender to blend it down. I prefer a thicker sauce so I let it simmer for 40 minutes. Delish.

I am very pleased with this sauce recipe.  I did use two pinches of sugar per reviews, and 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil instead of fresh only because the two stores near me didn't have any fresh basil.  I used 1 pinch of pepper (recipe doesn't specify) along with the  1 pinch of salt. I must say this is the best pizza sauce I have made to date.  It was even a little better the next day, probably because the flavors were able to fully mix overnight.  This is now my go to recipe for pizza sauce.

Awesome and easy. Have made it twice and have plans to make it again adding pepperoni and using it for grinders. (Italian meatball sandwich) Also makes a good marinara for breadsticks as I caught my son finishing the leftovers with the breadsticks I made out of extra pizza dough I had left. I only yelled at him for eating with his head still in the fridge which never happened before.

Delicious easy sauce. Great for folks sensitive to oregano or other typical pizza sauce seasoning.

It is a good recipe for someone that does not like to taste a lot of spice.  I found it a little bland.  I added more Oregano, garlic, some cumin and red pepper to spice it up and then it was much better.

4.7.16  I've tried a number of pizza sauce recipes on this site, and although most had good ratings, I felt none were good enough to make again.  This version is the best that I've tried.  I did add a little sugar and used freshly-chopped basil and oregano.  I left it simmer for about 45 minutes, and the texture was perfect for spreading onto a pizza crust.  Good recipe that will become  my go-to unless I can find one that tastes better than my favorite that they use at the Gourmet Pizza Company in Tampa.

This was easy and delicious.  I don't like chunky sauce so I pureed mine and simmered until it was a little thicker.  Excellent!

Great sauce! I also add sugar to counter the acidity. When I don't have fresh basil, I replace it with pesto, omitting also the garlic.

Excellent start-up sauce. I cook mine more, about 20 minutes, and add a little sugar to counter the acidity but other than that this is a very good basic sauce. The basil is a good addition, try to make a point to use it.

I didn't have any basil and used garlic powder instead and it tastes delicious! I puréed carrots and bell peppers and a few extra fresh tomatoes and added them just to up the veggie intake. My 3 yr old and everyone else in the family raves about my pizza!
