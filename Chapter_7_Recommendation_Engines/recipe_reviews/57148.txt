Great recipe for a change up on traditional potato salad.  Based on other reviewers suggestions, I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  Added 1/2 tsp of chili powder to kick it up a notch.  Will definitely be making this again for a change of pace.

This was a wonderful starting point for creating a delicious potato salad.  I brought it to my 4th of July picnic today and people's exact words were "oh my god this is so freaking good!" I did tweak the recipe a litle bit after taking users' advice and it turned out wonderfully.  I did/added the following with mine--

-I cut the potatoes first and then boiled them for a shorter time (12 min).
-I substituted one cup of mayo with 1 cup sour cream.
-I tossed it with 4oz of coarsely grated mild cheddar cheese.
-I added 4 chopped hard-boiled eggs.

I just wanted this salad to be out of this world and it was!  My friends loved it!

This went over well at our Dad's Day BBQ.  Subbing sour cream for half the mayo added nice flavor.  I followed a previous reviewer's recommendation and used less bacon... do NOT do this.  The bacon was the best part!!  Added more sliced green onions and real bacon bits to the top for presentation.

This stuff is GOOD!  After the initital cool down and I stirred the dressing and bacon in, I couldn't stop sampling it!  I disagree with an earlier review that it's better the next day...I actually liked it immediately after I put it all together because the bacon was still crunchy.  I think next time I will keep everything separate in the refrigerator until serving time, then throw together.  I prepared this one day ahead of time and while it was still very good, it lost the cruch of the bacon...which I really liked.  Great recipe!  I will make this again and again!

Not bad as a guide to build upon but I found it necessary to tweak some things to make it more palatable to me.  First, out of curiosity, I weighed the amount of bacon called for in the recipe.  Whoa.  Lots of bacon – too much for me!   I think I used half that.   Also, as I’ve never been a fan of straight mayonnaise in this type of salad, I cut it with sour cream.  I thought it needed some contrast in texture, so, as the expression goes, I added some celery “for a little crunch.”  As for the dressing, I found it a little weak.  Since I made just a third of the recipe to begin with, I gratefully had some of the dressing mix left over, so I added more, along with some fresh ground pepper, dill weed and garlic powder.  Finally, since I knew the salad would absorb some of the dressing as it chilled, I added some half and half to compensate.  A fair amount of tweaking, I admit, but it elevated this from a wimpy three to a four star potato salad.

Wonderful and so easy! This was a big hit! I also followed the others and used sour cream AND mayo. I'll be making this one again very soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

i do not care much for potato salad because of the mustard flavor. this is a great salad. the only thing i changed was that i actually fried the bacon instead of putting it in the microwave. I also made the ranch dressing myself from a mix and added sour cream. it tastes like a baked potato. its great!

We thought this was really good.  I too used the 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo.  I thought the ranch dressing packets were all 1 oz, but mine was only 1/2 oz, so could only make a 1/2 batch.  Make sure you buy the correct size.

Excellent!  Delicious precisely because it isn't bogged down with 40 different ingredients, although I did as other reviewers suggested and used 1C mayo and 1C sour cream.  Highly recommended.

good recipe (despite the fact that i didn't cook the potatoes long enough).  i served this at a family birthday party with barbeque chicken & green beans & got lots of compliments (even after i made the following substitutions:  instead of using 2 cups mayo i used 1 cup fat free sour cream & 1 cups light mayo, i used a small amount of minced onions in place of the green onions, & used turkey bacon instead of the real stuff).  i would make this again.

Flavor is good.  I used mix of mayo and sour cream as other reviewers suggested.  If only I could figure out how to make potatoes for potato salad so they are neither mushy nor too firm!!!

I've made this recipe many times and it's always a hit.  Great just as it is, but I have made a few alterations to suit my tastes.  I use one cup mayo and one cup sour cream; I use maybe 3/4 of the dressing packet and add about a teaspoon each ground black pepper and celery seed and a tablespoon of dijon mustard; add about 6 chopped hard boiled eggs.  Also, I make the dressing in advance of cooking the potatoes.  Add about half of the dressing to the potatoes while still warm so they absorb more of the flavor before chilling.  Then taste and adjust seasonings before adding the rest of the dressing and the bacon.  Yummy!

Very good.  This is similar to my potato salad recipe I make, except I use red onions instead of green and more dry ranch.  Add just a touch of yellow mustard and a splash of pickle juice..voila!  Yummy ranch potato salad!

Loved it.  I also used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  Omitted onions and added chopped celery and sliced black olives.  I used about 2/3 cup of REAL bacon pieces and it was still great.  Mix dressing with bacon ahead of time.  YUM!

I made this exactly to recipe and it was delicious! I love sour cream and will probably try that next time, subbing one cup of s.c. for mayo; but this was wonderful as is. Thanks for a new twist on potato salad!

I was looking for a good potato salad that had Ranch in it because there's a deli here in town that serves something like it.  This was the closest I could find and it was delicious!

Very nice recipe, thanks!  I did use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream because that's all I had ... also, I used 8 slices of precooked bacon - cooked in the microwave for about 50 seconds - much quicker and same results.  I will be making this again!

Really good, although I did do some substitutions and added some ingredients.  Instead of the full 2c of mayo, I did 1c of sour cream and 1c of mayo.  I also added hard boiled eggs and chopped olives.  I also reserved some of the bacon to sprinkle on the top when I served, that way everyone had some crispy bacon in their servings.

Some flavors do not belong together, even though they are great individually.  Ranch and potato salad do not happy marriage make.

Wow -- I've been making this for five years!  We love this recipe.  I make extra of the dressing, and use probably half sour cream and half mayo.  Yum, yum!  I mix in some of the bacon, but save some to sprinkle on just before serving.  This is a keeper -- we will make it over and over again.  I always get compliments when I make this.    Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

YUMMY!  You can completely play with this receipe to "fit" your taste. Because red potatoes come in different sizes in a 5 pound bag, I precut the potatoes BEFORE boiling into even cubes for even cooking.

I scaled this down to 6 servings.  We loved this.  I served it with Bunkhouse Beans (also from this site) and grilled steaks.  Great meal!  I used the full package of dressing mix which caused it to be a bit too salty so I'll adjust that next time.  Thanks for this different potato salad.  I'm always on the look-out!

Nice change from the usual.  This salad really taste much better if you let the flavors blend overnight.  Slightly bland for me, I would consider adding more mayo and Ranch seasoning next time.  But I will make it again.  This salad really has a lot of potential!

This was a nice change from regular mayo potato salads.  I would actually give it 3-3/4 stars.  It's not quite a 4, but definitely more than a 3.

I prepared this for a backyard barbecue.  The dressing had a unique tanginess and was simple enough to make.

This was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and I followed advice from others.  I added 3/4 cup sour cream to the 1 cup of mayo and it did taste like a baked potato.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks!

Everyone loved this, I thought a bit on the dry side, but maybe that was my fault, next time I'll add a little more mayo or sourcream. I wish I would have added hard boiled eggs-next time!

My husband hates cold 'salads' of any kind, but he loved this!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used half mayonnaise/half sour cream.  I also stir in the crumbled bacon right before serving it so it stays crunchy.  Great summer salad!

I printed this recipe years ago and love it.  I use 1c light mayo and 1c light s/c.  I usually make it early in the day so it gets good and cold in the fridge.  Thanks for sharing!

This is pretty good, my husband loves ranch so I thought I would give it a try.  I used low fat mayo and low fat sour cream (1 cup each) and it worked fine. Don't use turkey bacon though, it needs the real stuff!  I would mix everything (minus bacon) and let it sit overnight for the flavors to come together.  Before serving add the crisp bacon.  Thanks for sharing!!

Yum! I did a few substitutions:

1. I used frozen diced hashbrowns and cooked them up and let them cool (I think the browning of some of the potatoes makes it taste WAY better!).

2. I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream


Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a fan of "traditional" potato salad. This recipe is the only kind of potato salad I make any more. I use real bacon pieces instead of bacon strips and use 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream. This is an A+ potato salad.

This is the best potato salad ever, especially if you are not a fan of eggs in your salad.  I do make a couple of changes, I use sour cream instead of mayo, and I use two packages of the ranch.  Great recipe, Thanks!

Delicious! Made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  The first dish that was eaten up during the meal.  Used 1 cup non-fat sour cream and 1 cup low-fat mayonnaise, but lots of crisp bacon. lol.

I made several red potato salads yesterday and this one was our favorite. I used ready made Ranch dressing (the refrigerated kind from Sam's Club) as well as real bacon bits as timesavers. Let the flavors meld overnight and served today. Went great with a BLT.

I have made this a couple of times now. It is delicious! A nice change from the same old ordinary potato salad. The last time I made it, I used 1/2 bottle of bacon pieces instead of taking the time to cook bacon, which worked very well. This is a keeper!

This was delicious!  Definitely not your usual taste to potato salad, but a great change.  I did use Miracle Whip since that was all that I had.  I took it to a potluck and got lots of compliments and "What's in this? It's so good!"  I loved this and will make this often!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was good but I think it tasted like it had to much mayo.  Next time I make it I will use 1/2 sour cream like the others suggested and maybe add a little more dressing mix.  Although my boyfriend loved it just the way it was.

Just made it and used mayo and sour cream.  Added freeze-dried chives, parsley and custom shallot/dill/herb blend.  Serving it Sunday, so have reserve dressinf to add before serving.  Used bacon grease over warm potatoes before mixing it.  My guy loves his Ranch dressing, and he took a HUGE bowl home tonight.  I think his family will love it with Easter ham.

Whats not to like about potatoes, ranch dressing, and bacon? I had 2 cooked potatoes from the grill leftover. I peeed them, added 1/2 large green onion, 2~3 Tablespoons of Dukes regular and lite mayo mixed. Its what I had to use up. I added 1/2 teaspoon of ranch powder and 2 slices of pre-cooked bacon. It made 2 servings for packed lunches. Ty

This was a pretty good salad.  I followed other reviewers advice and did 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of mayonnaise.  It had a good basic flavor, but I only gave it four stars because it could have had more.  I added a little ranch dressing prior to serving because it was a little bland.

This is really good and so close to my favorite pot. salad that my local deli makes.  Like others, I substituted 1/2 of the mayo for sour cream.  Next time, I will add about 1# less potatoes just to give it a bit creamier of a texture.  Over all, quite delicious!  Got me over my fear of making potato salad.

This was pretty good.  I made it over 4th of July weekend and everyone there loved it. My sister got the recipe from the website the next day to make it-as good as it was it's probably not something I'll make on a regular basis, not because it wasn't good-but just because my husband and I don't eat potato salad that much.  Overall, it was a recipe worth making!

This stuff is awesome! I won't touch original potato salad so I was looking around for something to substitue. I FOUND IT! I took other review advice and put 2 cups cheese and half mayo half sour cream. I also didn't wait 2 hours. I mixed my dressing while the potatoes were cooking then mixed it together. WOW! I did serve it cold the first time, but now whenever my family wants creamed potatoes with our meal we eat THIS! Is is like a loaded baked potato...mashed. So awesome served hot! (My kids won't eat the potato skin if we eat regular a baked potato, but they love this. So as a mom it's a great way to get the nutrients of the potato skin in my kids!)
Oh! Like spicy stuff? Try using the spicy mayo or pepperjack cheese!

Thanks 8Break for this delicious and quick recipe. My changes: I didn't have green onions, so I used a little sweet yellow onion diced. I didn't have dry salad dressing mix, so I used ranch with jalapeno that comes in a jar. I took others suggestions and added grated eggs and grated cheddar cheese. I also used the pre-cooked bacon for ease in prep. I cut up my potatoes in a medium dice. I always cook my potatoes that way. They cooker faster and more evenly.
I will definitely make this the next time I need to bring something to a potluck. It was wonderful.

Really super delicious!! I love and my family all love potato salad... especially with a beautifully cooked steak on the BBQ, and this was probably better than my grandmothers, who up until now has been the potato salad maker in the family:) Move over nan! (Only thing i changed was the red potatoes - very hard to buy in Australia - used regular baby potatoed instead!)

Simple to make and full of flavor!  I've been looking for a potato salad that tasted more like a baked potato.  Not your traditional mustard, mayo potato salad.  This is it!  The changes I made are 4 pounds of potatoes instead of 5 and for the mayo amount I used half sour cream.  I'm making this again for the fourth and doubling it!  Last time the bowl got licked clean and this time I'm going to be prepared.  Thank you so much!!

A tasty alternative to the traditional mustard potato salad (of which I am a fan).  I used half sour cream and half mayo with twice as much ranch dressing mix for the dressing.  I cooked half as many potatoes and made the full recipe of dressing, planning to use the remainder as dip for veggies, but ended up using most of it on the salad.

I have made this many times for family get togethers and also pot lucks at work. I never have any left over. I'm not a big green onion fan, so I generally leave those out! I hate mustardy potato salad, so this is a great one for me! I guarantee you will love it!

Very good...I used half mayo and half sour cream. I also used the real bacon bits instead of frying bacon. My only negative comment is that I found it to be quite salty-but the flavors were delicious-and my husband loved it! :^)

I took this to a church function last night and there were no left overs.  The only thing I did different was I made my own ranch dressing that I got from All recipes.  I will diffently be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I don't normally like potato salad, but this was KILLER. I did the half mayo, half sour cream thing that other reviewers have suggested, and it was perfect, light and tangy and delicious.

I made it. Didn't have red potatoes so I used regular ones. Wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. Used 1/2 the bacon - BIG mistake! Def use the whole package. Best part.

Couldn't keep my husband out of it! Took this to a 4th of July party and it was a hit!  I also used 1/2 sour cream and 5 boiled eggs.  Also added about a 1/2 cup of chopped celery and about 1/3 cup of Woeber's horseradish sauce. That really kicked up the flavor level!  Will do this again.

Was very good, everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly but I added 1 cup of sour cream and a cup of shredded mild cheddar. This made it perfect! You can make it in advance but wait till last minute to add bacon so that it's crunchy.

Really good stuff the only thing I did different was chopping the potatoes before boiling. We enjoyed these and even the picky kids ate it since it wasn't overwhelmed with lots of ingredients.

I really liked the idea of this one, but had to do last minute damage control with extra seasonings/salt.  It might've been good with two packages of ranch dressing mix.  I used half mayo and half sour cream, as other reviewers recommended.  You'd think this would be tasty considering the ingredients that go in.

We recently found a BBQ joint nearby that had the most out of this world potato salad... I've always made mine with mayo and mustard, but went on a search for a recipe that compared to their potato salad... Who would have thought it was this simple??? I did half and half mayo with sour cream, and also added some chives in... Sprinkled some paprika on the top and YUM!!! Thank you so much, this is now how I will be making potato salad!!!

I have had this recipe a few years and for some reason I just realized I never rated it. This is my FAVORITE potato salad recipe. It's perfect as is. The only change I make is to use chives instead of green onion-- just personal preference. The family requests this now at big gatherings and it makes my grandmother jealous-- she has always considered herself the potato salad queen! Anyway--YUMMY!

Very good except I used 3 lbs potatoes not 5.  Seems like it would have been very dry with all 5 lbs.  Also, per other reviewers, used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  I was afraid it would be too salty with the ranch dressing mix and bacon, but it was not.  Next time I'll use a little less potato.  (I added the dressing while the potatoes were still warm so maybe they absorbed more dressing than cold ones would have.)

This was really good.  I subsituted 1 cup of sour cream like other reviewers' suggested.  I also added shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It makes a lot and there was A LOT leftover from a dinner of 7 people.  The leftovers weren't as good which is why I'm rating this a 4 instead of a 5.

Really delicious, a nice change of pace!  I did what several reviewers suggested and used 1 c. mayo and 1 c. sour cream.  I also added some shredded cheddar.  It was a big hit at the baby shower I took it to!  Needed a bit more seasoning (salt & pepper) but otherwise great.  I will definitely be making this again.

A definite favorite! I also substituted 1 cup of the mayo for sour cream and it was an excellent suggestion!!   Also, instead of boiling the red potatoes whole, I cut them into one inch cubes and then minimize the cooking time to 10-12 mins. Just makes my life easier...  Overall this is a fantastic, easy and delicious side dish to prepare for an impromptu BBQ or any other such occasion. I also find that when I dont have time to chill the potatoes in the fridge for 2 hrs, I put them in the freezer for about 30-45 mins and that does the trick!

Very good salad! It was a nice change from my normal potato salad. I used a 1/2 cup of scallions instead of 3/4 cup because that seemed like way too much. I also doubled the amount of ranch seasoning after the first taste because I thought it was too bland.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. The ranch dressing gives it a overpowering flavor that wasn't quite right. But it is unique and not terribly bad. It needs more balanace. I tried to create that by adding some cheese but it just didn't do it. My husband did say he liked it better than a regular potato salad but he didn't eat it after the first night. I just didn't think it was that great.

This is a keeper!!  I did what some others did and used half sour cream and half light mayo.  Excellent still warm, and excellent the next day chilled.  I can't wait to make this for my next barbeque.  Pretty sure this is going to be the end of traditional mustard potato salad for me.

Delicious!  I'm sure this is perfect as written, but I had to make the following changes based on what I had.  I used 1c bottled ranch and .5c sour cream and .5c mayo.  I also love fresh dill so I threw in about 1/8c chopped.  I love, love, love this recipe- thank you for sharing!

Yummy! Glad I read the other suggestions! I used 1C mayo, 1 1/2C light sour cream, and added 1C cheese. I pan-fried my bacon. It was excellent!

This was pretty good, I had a few little issues along the way.  My red potatoes were all different sized, some huge and some small, so some pieces were raw (the middle of the huge ones) and some soggy, so try to find a bag where they all look pretty small.  After it was all mixed, it seemed really bland, not enough flavor, so I added another whole packet of ranch dressing (1 oz) then it was much better!!!

YUM!!!!  I used Bacos because I'm a vegetarian and wanted to try it.  I loved it as did everyone else.  The only changes I made was the 1/2 sour cream/mayo thing suggested by others and I''m glad I did because it was SO creamy and good!  I mixed two packets of ranch and let it sit in the fridge for a day before mixing it into the potatoes.  I agree with other reviews, best when first made, still really good the next!  Thanks!

This is just awsome!The Best!
I did need to double the dressing as first batch was soaked up overnight. My boyfriend and I just loved it but makes so much for just us so will cut in half next time. This is a keeper!

A nice change from the mustard/mayo potato salad. I used sweet yellow onion instead of green and added a diced boiled egg. It became bland by the next day however so I had to add more ranch dressing but overall a good recipe. Will make again.

I took this to my sister's bridal shower.  No joke - I was instructed to email the recipe for this to everyone there.  It was so good!!!  My husband loves potatoes but hates how potato salad is always overcome with hard boiled eggs and mustard - not this one!  Who doesn't love ranch and bacon! Thank you for sharing!

I've made this for years, but I use bottled dressing (which also allows you to make it low fat or fat free) and add parmesan cheese to taste. I don't use the bacon, but I may try it. It does sound like rather a lot. You can also add eggs, if you want to make it heartier, and it makes a nice main dish with tuna, chicken, or ham. I like it best prepared right before you want to eat it. If it is chilled, it should be returned to room temp. and dressing added as needed. One of my all-time favorites. I don't even make "old-fashioned" potato salad anymore!

This was the first time I made potato salad and it turned out great.  Very tasty and loved the bacon, everyone enjoyed.  I think I may have added more mayo and dressing to make it creamier.

This was wonderful!  I've been looking for a good potato salad recipe for my daughter's birthday party and I'm not a big fan of mustard-based potato salad recipes.  This has a great flavor and will go well with lots of different types of party food.  Next time I make it, I would like to try adding some cheese to it, I think that is really all it is missing.  Love it!

Not bad! I'll forever be a sucker for Donna's red skinned potato salad-turned loaded baked potato salad (compliments of a fellow reviewer's inspiration!), but this is a close second. I did have to make a few changes to get the WOW factor tho.... I started by cubing my potatoes into large chunks (I basically quartered medium-sized red potatoes), boiled for 8 short minutes and chilled as directed. I then mixed equal parts lite mayo / sour cream instead of using all mayo. My final change was to add a couple small chopped celery ribs and a generous handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese (I wouldn't add the celery next time, but that's just me). NOTE: I halved this and ended up using the full amount of dressing called for. My potatoes seemed a tad dry without it but of course, this could be because I added a few extras. :) Since eight servings was far too much for my small family to consume, I gave a "to-go" container to my neighbor (she loves Ranch ANYTHING!!!). I was right. She absolutely loooved this and begged me for the recipe! Thanks for making me look like a cooking goddess, 8BREAK. :-)

Very good but I mixed the dressing while the popatoes were still warm and it absorbed into the potatoes better, added bacon just before serving.

It is necessary to refrigerate this potato salad before eating it or the ranch dressing is way too strong.  This is OK to make on occasion.

Made this for the first time today and it was really delicious! I did lighten it up a bit by using 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. Even my "I hate potato salad" husband ate two helpings. I felt like it was lacking a little something, and that something was dill. I added just a hit to my personal helping and then upon seeing how delicious it was added it to the whole bowl. Everyone agreed the dill took this over the top! I didnt measure, just added to taste. I strongly recommend it. Yummy!

This was great, everyone at the dinner party said so. I didn't get a chance to have any, it all disappeared from the bowl before I had a chance to have any. Afterwards everyone was asking me how to make this. I made two adjustments to this recipe, first I used a cup of sour cream and a cup of mayo instead of two cups of mayo, and instead of bacon slices I used Pancetta. Next time I make this I'll set aside some for myself.

Made this for my babyshower and everyone loved it. I first had it at a friend's and my husband loved it I on the other hand didn't care for it (my baby didn't like it I guess) butI received tons of compliments on it. It is so simple to make, especially since I was very ready to be due.  just don't make the bacon in the microwave it does not turn out good at all, make it on the stove top.

I was looking for something different than the Potato Salad I always make and this did not disappoint. It was delicious. I mixed the dressing a day ahead and then mixed the salad just before we ate it. I also added 4 hard boiled eggs(personal preference). The ranch flavor gives a new twist to potato salad. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of those recipes that I would classify under "pig-out" foods...like potato chips; I kept going back for more, and my family loved it too. It was easy to fix and was great left over.  =)

Followed the recipe exactly. **An absolute MUST to leave in fridge overnight.** I made the mistake of making a couple of hours ahead and no one ate it! Put it in the fridge overnight and hubby took it to work the next day and it got rave reviews!! He loved it and so did his coworkers! I still hear about how good it was! Thanks!......UPDATE: Hubs and his friend have been BEGGING me to make this every weekend since the first time I made it. Making it again tonight so it can sit in fridge until our get together tomorrow. I think this time I will take other reviewers advice and use 1/2 sour cream, just because I'm low on mayo and I am going to try adding a couple boiled eggs as well. Also, I will again add cheddar cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe! It's a hit at our house!

Served this at a birthday party and got RAVE reviews from all the adults.  So many people asked for the recipe.  So very easy to make.  I like that's there's not too much sauce, so it doesn't overpower the potato.  Very nice flavor.  My mother said that this recipe will be replacing the recipe she has used for the past 35 years or so.

This is such a huge hit at all our family gatherings, everyone asks for it! The only thing I did different is the cooling time, when I make it I usually dont have 2+hours to chill so I pop into the freezer to get chilly (around 30-45mins) then I add all the mayo and ranch packet. Definitely need to try this dish, its not your every day potato salad!

I loved it. I used a small yellow onion as that was all I had on hand. I would sprinkle the bacon on top to keep it crisp.

This was different! I didn't have bacon oops or green onion, so I just added some yellow onion. This would have been great with the bacon. I thought the dry ranch mixed with mayo was a little thick maybe I should have added some milk to thin it out. I love trying all different kinds of potato salad and this was great. Thank you!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I also substituted half of the mayo for sour cream and added a little chopped celery and hard boiled egg.  I took it to a barbeque the first time I made it and our friends still can't stop talking about it.  They said it was the very best potato salad they had ever had.

I gave this 4 stars, because it has potential. First it needs more Mayo (I did half mayo and sour cream), its not creamy enough. It needs to be SALTED and peppered. It needs more bacon. Put this all together, and it will be 5 stars.

This is my most requested recipe EVER. I make it exactly as it and I've done the 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo and it's always great. I usually bring the bacon along in a baggy and add it at the last minute. FANTASTIC!!! I've also not included the green onions but they really make it better. So easy, so good. I can't recommend this enough, of course my mind set is that bacon makes everything better!!

We made this for a BBQ and thought it would have been a big hit; but it wasn't. Disappointed with the bland taste. I found there was way too much dressing; we used bearly half of the mayo dressing. It basically just tasted like potatoes and mayonnaise. blah...

The recipe is definately a good starting point. I am one who loves a lot of flavor. I always prefer to make the recipe the way it is written first, then make changes where I deem necessary. This definately is one of the best potatoe salads I've ever had, however next time I do make it I will change a few things.  First make sure you cut the potatoes smaller than requested. Consider other responses to substitute sour cream. Use a quality bacon, maybe a thick cut apple smoked peppercorn one??? Add Kosher salt and generous amounts of pepper.  Increase the green onions. In addition, 20 minutes boiling time for the potatoes was not enough for me.

I have been looking for "the" potato salad recipe for over a year!  This is it!  Easy, make ahead, and WOW - tastes great!  I, too subbed the scream for 1 c. of mayo. and did not use bacon, but I bet that's even better.  I'm making a 2nd time today and am having to sub the gr. onions for chives, so we'll see.  2nd day is even better!  I just could NOT STOP eating this stuff!!

This recipe was awesome and a huge hit at a Fourth of July BBQ. I added cayanne pepper for a little extra kick. I recommend cooking the potatoes when just able to pierce with a fork, cooking them too long makes the the texture a bit to mushy.

This potato salad was quite tasty.  It was good to get my egg allergic child to eat some potato salad, but I thought it needed some eggs in it.  Very tasty, liked the ranch flavor to it, never thought of adding ranch but it works.  No one can go wrong with bacon in a salad, so I'm sure that's why my little men ate it so well.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure we'll end up making it again.

This was a major hit. I did have to cut the recipe in half considering there is only my husband, my 3 year old and myself. :) But, it was great the first time, and just as good as a leftover. Hubby says I should definitely make this again.

I added celery to this dish.  Very good, except redskins take longer to boil than regular potatoes -- make sure to boil long enough.  Great flavor!

Not overly impressed with this.  The taste just wasn't there and tho it was very different, some of the potatoes didn't get done enough - plus I don't think it was creamy enough.  Sorry but I'll stick with my mustard based salads.. Not again for me.

We love potato salad and this one moved up to the top of our list!  The Ranch flavor and crispy bacon made it perfect!

Two words - Dee - Lish!!! I've made this many times and everyone raves about it.  Something's wrong with your taste buds if you don't want to eat the entire bowl.

We really liked this.  I let the cooked, cooled potatoes and the dressing mixture sit separately in the fridge overnight and mixed them together about an hour before serving.  I also didn't have any bacon, so I used real bacon pieces instead, which worked really well.

I thought this was an awesome change to the regular potato salad. I made it at a BBQ, and the only thing I changed was I added a few extra ingredients.. sliced black olives, hard boiled eggs, and a 1/2 cup sour cream. It was excellent!! Everyone loved it. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe for a luncheon and everyone just loved it! I thought it was quite rich and heavy, but the flavor was very unique for a potato salad. I used half regular and half reduced fat mayo and slightly more scallions and it was fabulous.

This was wonderful! I took the previous suggestions and used 1 cup mayo/1 cup sour cream and I added a handful of cheddar cheese. It kind of lost some of the flavor after the first night I served, but that first night was WONDERFUL!!

Mom, I am sorry, but this is the best potato salad I have ever had. I used 1 cup mayo 1 cup sour cream and 2.5 lbs. red potatoes. I used 15 slices of precooked bacon and added a little shredded cheddar cheese. It was great as soon as it was mixed and I am eating a bowl of it right now, the next day, and it is just as good! Thank you for a great recipe.

I made 10 pounds of this for a backyard wedding/bbq and everyone loved it! I bought the pre cooked/crumbled bacon and only used 1/2 lb to 10 lbs of potatos and was glad I didn;t use the whole bag or it would have been bacon overkill.

I'm making this again this weekend!

This was pretty good, although I thought it lacked flavor.  We barbecued some steaks and had the buffalo shrimp recipe from this site last night.  I made this potato salad to go alongside and while it was good, it wasn't great.  I'll make it again for sure, but next time I think I'll add some celery, radish and maybe even a little tomato.  This recipe is definitely worth trying at least once.  It can always be adjusted to suit individual taste.  Thanks for sharing it 8Break!

This was excellent!  I used low-fat mayo and low-fat sour cream, and used a few bacon bits.  I also added chopped dill pickle, which added nice contrast.  It was very good, and was a good dish that made good leftovers.

I used 2.5lbs of red potatoes, but kept eveyrthing else the same. Everyone LOVED it. I had 3 people say they didn't like potato salad, but put a tiny bit on their plates. Well all 3 went back and couldn't stop eating it. I was shocked! Great recipe for so being so simple!

Love the bold flavors of ranch and bacon! As suggested, I used a mixture of mayo and sour cream, because I didn't have the full amount of mayo. I also sauteed the scallions briefly in bacon grease, just to soften them a little. Definitely planning to make again!

I made this for a family BBQ and it was a hit!  
I followed the recommendation of substituting 1/2 the mayo with sour cream.  Everyone loved it.  My son called it the Baked Potato salad.

This is amazing and is my go to potato salad recipe! Everyone I've made it for loves it as well! I love potato salad so i'm really picky about them.

Modifications: I do split the ratio of the mayo to 1 c of mayo and 1 c of sour cream.  And then I add some cheddar cheese, hard boiled eggs, and cayenne pepper as people had suggested.  And, sometimes I add more ranch dressing mix for a stronger flavor.  If the mixture doesn't  seem like a lot to the amount of potatoes, I'll add more sour cream and mayo.

I’ve made this several times and it’s quickly become a favorite, and a standard to bring to potlucks. People are surprised at a different kind of potato salad, and at the amount of taste.

My adjustment is to add an avocado.

Very tasty. I did what others suggested and did half mayo and half sour cream. I'm not even a big potato salad fan, but I will definitely make this again.

I always get raves about this potato salad whenever I make it.  The only thing I change is to use bacon bits(to save time) & I never cook the whole 5 lbs of potatoes.

Since the first time I made this is has been my favorite potato salad recipe.  I do half low fat sour cream & half low fat mayo as suggested by someone's rating. It always tastes better the next day!

I didn't follow the exact measurements, but did not add or change much to the ingredients.  My neighbors at the fish fry loved it!

Definitely one of the best potato salads I have ever had, and certainly the best I ever made myself. My husband made a point of telling me to save the recipe, and he never does that with salad. He even took some left over to work for his lunch.  I agree with the other reviewers that the extra touches made all the difference in the world. I included the chili powder--and could have used even more. I also added fresh diced radishes for some crunch as I have them in my garden. Finally I put in some diced boiled eggs.  The next time, I'll include some fresh black pepper as well. I also put a handful of shredded cheddar cheese in the dressing. The dressing would also work as a fantastic veggie dip.

I made this based on the reviews. I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo and subbed yellow onion for the green. I could probably have used the lowfat sc and mayo and still had a good result. I did add a dash of chili powder. I also used precooked bacon to save time and mess. Overall it was very good and everyone liked it. I personally did miss having a little crunch. It needed celery or chopped pickles IMHO.  Otherwise, it was pretty tasty.

 I looked it up and discovered that the best way to keep the potatoes firm enough is to simmer them without boiling.

Have a co-worker who makes this, and it always vanishes! So I asked her for the recipe. Almost identical to this except no mayo.  She uses one bottle of ranch, and half a bottle of bacon ranch. Delicious!

Made this for a family BBQ. Half the people prefer mustard potato salad, and half only like mayo potato salad. Everyone loved this one. Will definitely make again and will try to kick it up a notch.

Thought I'd try this for something different from regular potato salad. It has a great taste, but I couldn't really distinguish the ranch flavor. Think I'll try 2 packets of ranch mix next time. But overall, we really liked it.

This is great!!! I am not a fan of potato salad made with mustard - so it was a nice surprise to find this recipe! The only major change I made was per other suggestions and used 1 cup of may and 1 cup sour cream - PERFECT! I also added celery for texture and shredded cheese to kick it up a bit!

Recipe made as written and it was great! Everybody loved it. 

If you want some crunch maybe less green onion and add some spanish onion or a little celery if you like it. Substituting some of the mayo for sour cream would add a little zip. A dash or two of Montreal Steak Seasoning might give it a bit of a nice kick.

I make this salad fairly frequently now.  It's a huge hit.  However, I am guilty of  some tweaking....

First, I add a little more bacon.  The original amount was plenty for me, but I've got a lot of bacon fiends in my family.  I also fry it up very crisp as I'm usually making this the day before and it will soften somewhat overnight.  
Next, I sub sour cream for 1 cup of the mayo.   I also sub bacon fat for a 1/4 cup of mayo...again for those bacon addicts.
The only other change I make is the addition of chopped fresh parsley just because  I love the stuff. 

Overall, this is an excellent recipe that has made its way into my permanent catalog.

Thank you very much for sharing!

This is a refreshing spin on potato salad.  Makes a great side to brats. Just like eating a cool loaded baked potato.

Added celery since I like a bit of crunchy in my potato salads.  Added pepper and left out bacon this time.  I also mixed sour cream and mayo.  Flavor is wonderful and easy to make.

I love this recipe as is. I bought sour cream to make it as others recommended, but in a hurry to get it made for a short notice picnic I forgot to make the change. The original recipe was excellent as is. You really don't need to make changes to this recipe

Used the 1/2 mayo sour cream. When potatoes were hot added 1/4 cup olive oil and mixed. Keeps the potatoes from being too dry, also added cayenne pepper and salt as needed.

i make this with bottled low fat ranch dressing and less mayo. some family members do not care for onions so I use a small amount of minced onions and they plump up during the blending of flavors.  sometimes i add shredded cheddar cheese too. you can cut the amount of bacon to about half and add a little pepper.   Yum!

I've used this recipe for years. My family loves it, and, frankly, it's easier than classic potato salad. As we are vegetarians, I omit stirring in bacon and allow people to add their own measure of bacon flavored bits at the table.

I too like a sour cream and mayo blend.    I alway put the mayo in the potato salad while the potatoes are hot.   It absorbs the flavor much better.   I add the bacon right before serving so it will stay crunchy.

This was great!!! Just made this following the exact recipe and loved it! Next time I might change it up and follow other reviewers' suggestions about sour cream or omit the bacon...I'm not a huge fan of bacon but it was great in this!

i have been making this for years since I found recipe on a package of ranch dressing mix.  I microwave potatoes in batches of about 5 similar size potatoes until just soft.  (Do NOT mico until very soft or the salad will be mushy.)  as 1st batch of potatoes cool, start to slice up (I do them in slices, not chunks) and layer in a dish.  add some dressing green onions & repeat until done. (I have not used the bacon often, and still great.) Potatoes absorb dressing & salad not as gooey.  YUM.

Just tasted like ranch dressing which was a bit over powering. I added some Louisiana seasoning and green olives. Next time I will add some chopped eggs.

Not bad!  I only had certain ingredients... so I played on the original recipe to fit what I had.  I did cut down on the mayo like other people said, and added ranch dressing instead of the packet. I didn't have sour cream, so I left it out, and added a bit of cheddar cheese with the bacon near the end.  I also served it warm instead of cold.  It got the hubby thumbs up. :)

I like heavy flavors so I added 1/2 oz extra of ranch dressing mix, garlic powder, and white pepper.  I also did as others suggested and added 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Turned out wonderful!

This was a great recipe.  My husband I both felt like it was missing the pickles of a traditional potato salad.  Next time I will add pickles or maybe sliced green olives.

This is the best potato salad EVER!  I awoke at midnight craving a bowl!  Definitely not your grandma's recipe.  I also recommend substituting 1 cup sour cream for 1 cup mayo and adding hard boiled eggs and cheddar cheese!  This potato salad started making me believe in potato salad again!

This is delish!!!  I use regular russets in this recipe and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  It is also tasty with a Claussen pickle or 2 diced in it.  Great recipe for these warm days!

Our teenage daughter and husband ask for this recipe regularly.  They like to eat it alone as a meal!  The only change I made was to increase the ranch dress to (2) packages.  This is great with the ranch burgers, too!

I thought this recipe was very good and quick & easy to make! I didn't have green onions, so I added onion powder to the sauce. My husband is not much of a potato salad guy, but enjoyed this one!

I make this every year at our annual Memorial Day party. It goes so fast, I don't even have to worry about keeping it cool.  A must for any large gather! I also recommend if you have someone who is allergic to onions that you can leave them out and it is just as tasty.

Excellent recipe, star of the barbeque.  I put in an extra half lb. of bacon and used half sour cream and half real mayo.  I sprinkled about a palm full each of cheddar cheese and chopped green onion on top, cause it looks AWESOME.  Everyone loved it and I looked like a genius, lol.  Will absolutely make this again, thanks for the recipe.

This was a great salad. I can't eat eggs & didn't miss them in this recipe. I used a half light mayo/half non-fat plain yogurt combo. I also added more green onions & some kosher salt and pepper to the dressing. It tastes better after sitting overnight. Thanks!

Great recipe for those who don't like traditional potato salad.  Will be making this one often.  I did use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  Thanks.

Wow! I don't usually like creamy salads, but this was really very good! It was a hit with my picky family (probably b/c it was ranch-flavored). The kids liked it so much that they didn't even notice the green onions. I made it with 1 c light mayo and 1 c light sour cream. I also used imitation bacon bits and it still tasted great! I can't wait to bring this to potlucks!

This was really good! I made it last night for an impromptu BBQ. I made a couple of changes, added a bit of sour cream in place of some of the mayonnaise. I also added a dash of parmesan cheese and salt & pepper. mmmmm!

I live in the south and a lot of people around here prefer the "salads" that are made with Miracle Whip and have sugar added to them. I prefer the more savory ones, and this one was great. This is definitely my kind of potato salad. Even still, my husband and all of his family prefer the other kind that I was talking about, BUT they all loved this one. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this as did most of my family.  I did cheat and used Marzetti's ranch vegetable dip for the dressing.  I also added 3 hard boiled eggs.  I will be making this again.

This recipe was easy to make and so delicious. It really did taste like a loaded baked potato! I did add 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese as was suggested by other people. The flavor of the dressing with the potates really sets this potato salad apart.

This potato salad was great!  The amount of dressing was perfect for a nice creamy potato salad both the first and second days!!  I will be making this MANY more times in the future!!  My husband requests it every time I buy potatoes.  I do follow the other reviewers recomendations and use half sour cream instead of all mayo, I also add fresh chopped onion and bell peppers for some added color.

This is a fantastic twist to a traditional potato salad.  I love that it does not use eggs and uses red potatoes.  I, too, subbed sour cream for half of the mayo.  Will definitely bring this to many, many summer gatherings!

This is just too good! I subbed non-fat yogurt for half the mayo and I only used 1/2 the bacon which was plenty.  Hubby loved this with our steaks. This will be a new staple!

This was terrific! I served this over 4th of July weekend for a cookout and everyone loved it.

I made a few changes - first, I used 1 c. sour cream & 1 c. mayo (instead of all mayo)...I also added a cup of shredded Cheddar cheese.

I personally prefer this side slightly warm or room temperature, but it's good chilled.

Since I like bolder flavors, I think I will add some extra Ranch mix.

I will be using this recipe on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing!!!

SO good!!  But okay, I modified b/c I didn't have bacon on hand. SO, I cut a few tbsps of the mayo and replaced it with deli mustard.  Then it was a little mushy and lacking in texture so I added dill relish.    Can't wait to try it with bacon!

My family, including my picky eaters, loved this potato salad.  I was out of green onion, so I used finely chopped red onion instead and it was really delicious.  This will be a regular at our house!  I followed someone's advice from another potato salad recipe and cut up the red potatoes into bite size pieces with skins on, and steamed for 15 minutes- they turn out perfect every time.

Wow! Wonderful recipe! I like good old mustard potato salad but DH does not. He loved this one! I did sub sour cream for half the mayo as suggested and it was perfect. It was great the next day too even if the bacon loses its crunch. Thanks so much!

WOW! I served this during a family Memorial Day dinner and everyone loved it, and requested seconds. I took it to work for lunch, and it was still really good. I didn't cook the bacon in the microwave for as long as the recipe said, I put it in for six minutes, and it was perfect. The bacon makes the salad!

This was good but not as good as I had hoped.  It needed some spicing up so I added some of the spices normally found in ranch salad dressing (garlic powder and onion powder), salt and pepper, and I also added extra green onion. Definitely don't reduce the amount of bacon and either add it right before serving, or have people add their own. This is definitely worth making after changing it up a little bit to suit your own tastes.

Another great recipe!!  This was such a hit.  I actually didn't use the bacon and it still turned out great, but if I did I would put on each serving so it wouldn't be soggy.  The only thing I did different was I added a little salt and pepper to taste and added 3 boiled eggs chopped.  This is a keeper!

My boyfriend got tired of the same-old mustard potato salad I've made for years, so for Memorial Day I tried this recipe.  While it was a nice change of pace, we found it a bit too ranchy for our own tastes, so we ended up adding mustard, Hungarian paprika, chives, salt and pepper making it like a regular mustard potato salad with a ranch kick.  I also left the skins on for the color and nutrients.  Our end recipe was beautiful with yellow, green and red.

My advice to anyone trying this recipe would be to slowly add in the ranch with the mayo; I just dumped the whole thing in at once when I should have known better.

This recipe has a great taste concept that is different from your run-of-the-mill potato salads while still staying a bit more traditional.

I don't usually review recipes, but I thought this one deserved it.  If anyone is hesitant to try this, don't be.  I took a family poll try this recipe or my tried and true family favorite mayo with mustard and egg potato salad.  Everyone picked the usual, so I made the ranch potato salad instead.  EVERYONE loved it!  Here are some changes I made for my family:  1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream; through in a little white vinegar (2 Tbls) because we like ours to have a little zip; also added some heavy cream because I had it and I needed to loosen up the dressing a little bit; didn't have a lot of green onions so I used sweet onions; lastly I used turkey bacon.  Honestly, I will take this to the 4th of July celebration.  I am usually asked to bring my potato salad, but this year I am going to bring this potato salad.  It is that good.

Very good.  Different from other potato salads that I've had.  This is actually the first time I ever made potato salad because I never really cared for it.
Everyone said it was good.  I will make it again.  I also used sour cream for half of the mayo.

This is excellent potato salad, and something a little different from your standard potluck fare.  I agree to substitute half the mayo for sour cream - it adds an extra kick that really goes well with the other ingredients.

I was excited to make this salad given all the excellent reviews.  It was good but not as great as I was expecting.  I took other's advice and added shredded cheddar and substituted 1/2 the mayo with sour cream.  I liked the bacon crunch.  It needed pepper for my taste.

This is awesome.  I made it at a family reunion and everyone wanted to recipe.  Per other suggestions I used half mayo and half sour cream.  I also did not let it sit 2 hrs.  Maybe a half hour.  The bacon was crispy which everyone thought added to the salad.  LOVED IT!

Wow! I made this recipe as a simple side dish for my family, and it was a hit! My husband hates potato salad but is a ranch lover, and he liked this recipe. Didn't have any bacon on hand and so I just sprinkled in some bacon bits to taste and it was still fabulous, although I bet it's even better with real bacon. This is definitely going into my regular rotation!

Great recipe!  I was looking for something different for my western-themed birthday party and this fit the bill.  Really flavorful, and a nice change from the mayo/mustard potato salad I usually make.  Got lots of compliments!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

Rave reviews from everyone in the MOMS Club of Abingdon. Excellent and extremely easy! I let the marinade sit over night and used some of those real bacon bits instead of real bacon and still came out great!

This was good, a nice change from the regular potato salad, however I felt it was missing something.  Maybe green pepper or celery or cheese?  I also pan fried my bacon and just used mayo with the ranch dressing.  Will have to play with, but I would definitely try.  It came out very well.  Maybe the cheddar cheese will do the trick as others have suggested.

This was very very good. However, next time I will not use as many potatoes. I also took others advice and used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup mayo. I shared the recipe with a co-worker and she said her husband only requests this potato salad now.

This is one of the best potato salads I have ever served.  Great hit at a picnic! I already gave out the recipe the first time I made it and will make it again and again.

Pretty good!  Definitely has a different flavor, but I really like it.  Just make sure to cook the bacon till really crisp, so it doesn't get soggy, and it also gives it more flavor.

If you like ranch dressing then you would definitely enjoy this recipe. I'm not that crazy about ranch so this was just ok for me. I made this for a party today (along with four other salads). A few people loved it, including my son and my brother-in-law.
I did use 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup mayo.
Anyway thanks for sharing.  I know I will be making this again for othe parties.

I made this for the 4th of July cookout my family had and everyone went crazy over it.  This is probably the best potato salad dish I have ever made.

This potato salad was awesome.  I'm used to the kind my mom makes which has radishes and mustard. This was very easy to make and I followed directions to a tee(oh! except microwaving the bacon, I fried it in a pan.)  I wouldn't change a thing!

This was a great recipe! Had a cookout with just 6 people and this was the only thing I didn't have any leftovers for!

I love this recipe because it doesn't require too many ingredients or too much time. I used bottled ranch dressing and only half the bacon.The family loved it! I will definitely make more next time.

The only thing I change is to cut up the potatoes before boiling them.  My husband badgers me to make this all the time.  The bacon gets soggy after it's been mixed in, so wait until the latest possible moment to put it in.
