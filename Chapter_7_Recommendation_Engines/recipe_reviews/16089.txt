Yummy!  My family loves them.  Here's what I did differently, though :D  I used 1 cup of cornmeal, 1 cup of regular flour & a tablespoon of baking soda (in place of the 2 cups self-rising flour).  I also added a little pepper and two tablespoons of white sugar (I think I'll try brown sugar next time).  I fried them in a frying pan, in about 1 1/2 inches of oil, so had to flip them over once they got brown on one side.

Was great!  Instead of two cups of flour did 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of cornmeal was great

The hushpuppies came out more like a doughnut - very doughy in the middle - and greasy.  Definately not the traditional cornmeal hushpuppies.

This was very good, even my children LOVED them.  I did not have "self rising" anything so I used 1c flour 1 c cornmeal + 2 t. baking powder to cover that.  Now that I think about it I could have used something like Krusteaz or Bisquick, but I really enjoyed the cornbreadish taste/feel so I would still use the cornmeal.  I also added a little bit of Turbinado (natural grain)sugar, maybe a T.  I've never fried before, this was my first go and it was GREAT!  I'd say the secret is to actually wait the 10 minutes they suggest, before that it was way too runny.  It thickened up perfect though.  This recipe made 29 "pups".  (Boy they went fast!)  GOOD LUCK!

These Hush Puppies or another referred to them as corn fritters are terrific.  I altered the recipe as suggested by another reviewer(s) using 1 c. cornmeal, 1 c. self-rising flour, 2 tsp. baking powder and chopped pickled jalapeno.  My husband and I are not typically into preparing deep-fried foods, but these Hush Puppies/Fritters were light, airy and quite delicious.  Thanks to the original recipe submitter and to those that "tweaked" this creation.  These were a very nice addition to our battered and deep-fried Cod.  Sat. night dinner was dee-lish!

Excellent! I followed advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 c of corn meal in place of 1/2c of the flour. I added about 2t of baking powder and more salt. The result is a light texture, not greasy and great corn taste.  A keeper!

I made several modifications to this recipe. First I used a 6oz pack of cornbread mix and added enough self-rising flour to equal 2 cups total. I added 1/4 cup onions and 1 jalepeno to the mix. I then added some garlic powder, cumin and chili powder and then followed the recipe the rest of the way. It is very important to let this sit for at least the 10 minutes before cooking. The hushpuppies came out light and fluffy..YUMMY

These were really good. I would say they are more of  "corn fritters" than "hush puppies". I followed the recipe exaclty and have no complaints about taste or texture. Thank you.

I wasn't that crazy about this one.  I thought they were a little bland.  I chopped up an onion in lieu of the minced onion and I still thought they came up a little short on taste.

Great hush puppies. I had ran out of self rising flour, so I used 1 cup of bisquick and 1 cup of corn meal.  They were very tasty.  My husband who said he didn't like hush puppies even ate them.

This were more like a corn fritter than a hush puppy.  I think next time I will add some garlic and table salt instead of using seasoning salt.

I forgot to add the eggs and only had a short can of the corn.  I added a little oil, milk and water to make up the added moisture needed.  They were a hit!

These get a fail from me. I expected great things but instead I got a poor reaction from family and friends. Even after adding another tsp of salt and a tsp of chili powder, which I'm sure is not authentic, mine turned out very bland. They were light and not greasy but not worth the effort.

I really enjoyed these, a great addition to our crab feast. I did take advice from the other comments adding 1 cup cornmeal, and some sugar. Also I made half batch with jalepenos! Yummy

Wonderful and so easy.  I used 1 C cornmeal and 1 C s-r flour and added 2t of baking powder.  Also added fresh chopped onion and chopped pickled jalapenos (tame ones).  VERY GOOD!!  Very light and fluffy and yummy.  I did not add any sugar, the creamed corn gives it a nice sweetness.  Also used a melon scoop to place them in the peanut oil in my iron skillet.  Thanks Larry!!!

The recipe is okay as is, but I think there needs to be some changes before I'd call it a four or five star recipe.  I'd do at least half cornmeal and half flour, add more onion, maybe a little chopped bell pepper, and perhaps some other seasonings, including extra salt.  It's a good base recipe though.  Thanks for sharing.  I think with some work, it will be a five-star recipe.

Awsome hushpuppies. I added some cornmeal to the mix so it would have the texture I remember them having. I added a smidge of old bay, salt & pepper. You could season these anyway you desire. Thanx for the keeper!

These were kind of bland and the middle took a while to be cooked all the way through.  I used a little extra salt and added about a tablespoon of sugar to give it some more taste.  They were okay though.  Sort of tasted like biscuits.

I made these hush puppies for fish fry and everyone loved them! I took the other advise about using 1-1/2c flour with 1/2c cornmeal instead of the 2c flour and it was awesome. Goes real good with the Beer Batter Fish Fillet recipe!

This recipe is incredible as Tod Mun, a Thai corn fritter.  This tastes EXACTLY like the Tod Mun at the best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten (in Davis, California).  Serve with any sweet and spicy (not sour - spicy) sauce in the Asian section of your supermarket.  FABULOUS!!!

I made a this recipe earlier in the summer and made a couple of modifications. I used a 50/50 mix of regular cornmeal and flour, 2 tsp of baking powder and used onion powder instead of minced onion. I followed the instructions as written and they turned out well. My girlfriend liked them more than me however. I thought they tasted fine but couldn't get over the corn bits from the creamed corn. I'll try to find a recipe that omits the creamed corn. I liked that they were a little on the sweet side as this is my preference. They also reheated well in a 350°F oven the next day.

Yum! Per other reviews I did sub half the flour w/ cornmeal. I also baked them instead of fried and they turned out just dandy!

Very good. I did 1.5 c flour, .5 c cornmeal, 2 t baking powder for dry ingredients. I had to be careful to make them small (no bigger than a golfball) or they would be runny inside.

These were wonderful.  I did use self rising cornmeal mix instead of the flour because that was what I had and it worked great too.

These hushpuppies came out perfectly! They puffed up and had a great texture. I followed the recipe exactly except for using vegetable oil instead of peanut oil because it's what I had on hand. I think next time I might look into adding more seasoning for some added flavor. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

The flavor was great. I made these for a fish fry and everyone loved them! I did add some sugar as desired for flavor and used one small chopped onion instead of minced onion. I also used a small metal soup ladle to slowly dip them into the hot oil because the mixture is creamy.

I will not try this recipe again. I followed the recipe to a T. When it came to deep frying them you pretty much had to just pour the batter in. It didn't form at all.

I made this recipe exactly and it didn't turn out well. I was skeptical with not using corn meal and I was right. Hush puppies in my opinion, require cornmeal. These were very dense and tasteless. If you choose to make this recipe at least do 1/2 flour, 1/2 cornmeal.

I'll make these again. I've been looking for a good HP recipe. In the South here everyone makes their own and (Northerner me) I always made the mixes. They are OK but seems like it couldn't be hard to make them from scratch either. Most have too much cornmeal for me to love them the way everyone says they do. I love this softer, moister recipe. I did use a little cornmeal in place of 1/2 cup of the flour and I did use reg. flour and 2 tsp. baking powder. baking powder. My main gripe is that recipes using canned goods can't be scaled easily. Cut the recipe in half and use 1/2 a can of corn, you usually end up wasting the other half of the can anyway. Don't scale it and it makes a huge batch that you throw out most of anyway. I may try frying the leftover batter and freezing them. Maybe that's the secret.

Out of this world!  I have never made hushpuppies before, and my husband has only made them from a box!  They were soooo moist and to think you add creamed corn.  The next weekend following, I made them again for my in-laws! They loved them just the same!  We use a sweet onion, and add more than requested (to our taste).  Thank you so much for this great recipe.
