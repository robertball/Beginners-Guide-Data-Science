Hello! We have updated step 1 in the directions for this recipe. This should solve some of the problems regarding the gelatin not setting. We hope this helps! - Ths Staff

I had no idea I would find this recipe here, and it is a little different from the one we make. In my family, it is always a tradition on Thanksgiving or Christmas. We make it with creamed cheese instead of mayo, milk, and cottage cheese.  I never get tired of it, but it's a good thing we only have it once or twice a year!!!  Any way you make it, it's GREAT!

My family makes this every thankgiving and sometimes christmas....we change it up a bit, though.  Instead of mayo and milk we use yogurt (either lime or lemon flavor) and we also use walnuts instead of pecans.  Its delicious!

oh... my.... god.  i cant stop saying it.  i made some of this tonight, was a little iffy about the mayo but i put it in anyways, was a little worried about how it would turn out because it smelled really mayonnaisey when i went to put it in the fridge and seemed a little greasy around the edge of the bowl when i went to wipe the edge for a picture.  im saving it for dessert tomorrow but i wanted to taste a little bit to see how it turned out.. and HOLY .  this stuff is absolutely to die for.  that little bit is about to turn into the whole bowl full, but i need to be strong.    i did everything exactly how the instructions said, except i dont like pecans so i substituted those for sliced almonds and i added shredded coconut.  nothing too drastic that would change the flavor much from the original recipe.    its not how i remember the green jello salad being made when i was little (i think it was just pineapple, grapes, coconut and pecans mixed in the lime jello) but its  good... much MUCH better than how i had it when i was growing up.  definitely keeping this one for years and years.. and im going to share it with anyone that will take it.  do NOT let the mayonnaise in it stop you from making this.

My Mother made this always for the holidays she added chopped celery. It really added a great taste and crunch. I would say 1/2 cup to this recipe.

My family, too, has made this recipe for years, we all love it and think Thanksgiving and Christmas require this salad. However, we add chopped celery, but never canned milk. How does that affect the salad?

I am so thrilled to see this recipe as it has been a family favorite for generations in our family as well.  We always thought that our family was the only one that liked it as in-laws and others did not appreciate it even slightly!  In our family we included, if you can believe it a teaspoon or more of prepared horseradish!  Gives it a kick and is completely bizarre to wrap your head around but it works.  Ours also used walnuts from the family farm in Gridley, CA.  This recipe made me very nostalgic for wonderful holidays during my youth.  THANKS!

Delicous! I was a little nervous at first when i read about the mayo since i'm not big on mayo, but it tasted wonderful!! I didn't add the pecans since i don't like nuts and it was perfect. Thanks!

One of my family's favorite holiday treats.  It has been a staple menu item at every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter for decades.  (Except we use walnuts and chopped celery instead of pecans.)

Just make sure you dissolve the gelatin properly, and give it plenty of time to set before serving.

This was my first time making this for a potluck luncheon at work and it was very tasty. I did make some modifications and everyone said it tasted great.  My changes:  1. Substituted 1 cup plain yogurt for the mayo 2. Used the crushed pineapple juice + juice from drained small can mandarin oranges + water to make 1 cup liquid  3. Added 1 cup shredded flake coconut 4. Added small can of mandarin oranges  I let it refrigerate overnight and it was nicely gelled the next morning. Yummy! Will make this again.

This is very similar to one my Grandmother served at ALL holiday dinners.  I've made it in the past, but without the milk, and it's always turned out great.

In blender place the hot water, cream cheese, and the lime jello.  Blend well. In another bowl, place the rest of the ingredients and add the lime jello mixture and mix well.  Pour into mold and place in fridge for at least 6-8 hours or overnite.  It's a family favorite and requested for the holidays. Hope you enjoy as much as we do.

This is reminiscent of holidays when I was a little girl.  It is hard going trying to make jello salads over here in Scotland.  You can't get powdered jello, and the cubes are just not the same.  Still, this came out good, and our guests were intrigued by what it was, and really enjoyed eating it!

I was very excited to see this recipe.  My mom & grandma have made this for years, our family loves it!  My recipe was very vague so it is nice to have a more detailed description.  To cut calories and sugar I have made this with sugar-free jello, low-cal mayo, & fat-free evaporated milk & it it still tastes great!  Sometimes, walnuts & marachino cherries are added.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was a disaster. I made it for a holiday meal at work. It never gelled. It stayed in a liquid form. I was mortified. The saving grace was that it tasted delicious.

I make this every year.  Family loves it!  I always add 1 - 2 teaspoons horseradish.  Gives it a little zip. I finely chop walnuts or pecans and sprinkle on top.  Makes it an attractive dish and those who don't like nuts can scrape them off and still enjoy the salad.

My in-laws called it green marsian food. I leave out the mayo,milk,cottage cheese and use whip topping instead. I wait for jello to soft jell and mix in small container of whip topping blending enough to see tiny chunks of jello so that it looks a bit green and white, even sometimes leaving jello in bottom undisturbed

Very similar to mine, but I add 1 tsp of horseradish and 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Not all my family like nuts in this salad, so I make half with nuts and another dish without.  Can use walnuts or pecans. Yum!

My sister-in-law asked if I could find and make this recipe for Thanksgiving and I am so glad I did, it was great! I did use sugar free jello and light mayo and it still tasted great. I am sure I will be making this many times.

I lost this recipe from my mom.  I serve it in the summertime as a side with a barbecue.  The only difference is I add a teaspoon of horseradish.  Double the mayo and omit the evaporated milk.  I also use walnuts instead of pecans.  It is my favourite jelly recipe.

Love this recipe! My mother-in-law first introduced this to me(she added a small grated apple) and I didn't care for it at first but it has grown to be a favorite!

My recipe is:  Lightly oil your mold first (makes 1 large or 2 small ring molds).  Dissolve 1 envelope Knox gelatin in a small amount of cold water.  Mix a 3 oz. package of lime Jello and a 3 oz package of lemon Jello with the gelatin in 3 1/2 cups hot/boiling water.  Add 1 cup mayonnaise and dissolve thoroughly, using whisk or hand egg beater.  Mix in 1 cup small curd cottage cheese and pour into mold(s).  Sprinkle 1 1/2 oz slivered almonds on top.  Refrigerate until firm (I always prepare this the day before so that it chills overnight).  Unmold on serving platter by dipping mold in warm water and running a dull knife around the edges of the mold.  The original recipe from my mother's cousin called for a can of crushed pineapple, but we like it better without - except for my son-in-law, who thinks that mixing Jello and mayonnaise is a crime against humanity!

Unique flavor.  I substituted walnuts for the pecans.  I think pecans would have been better.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, everyone loves it. The only thing that I had changed was that I used Plain Greek Yogurt, still tastes the same and no one's knows that I used yogurt.

I had made this  for years, but changed a bit from this to fit a wreath mold. Instead of cottage cheese, I used 6 oz. of shredded Med. cheddar and thinly sliced almonds. When it's unmolded, decorate the top with maraschino cherry halves. Thanks for this, I had forgotten the pineapple juice for the water. Always a go to salad for a pot-luck and Christmas.

I made two batches, one with mayo and one with cream cheese.  Both were delicious, in fact when I asked one my family liked few could taste they were not sure which was which.  That said, the cream cheese set up firmer.
I want to add a bit of salt to and not sure how, perhaps chopped salt pistachio nuts next time.  Also finely chopped celery as many have mentioned.

I have made this for years, it is a family tradition.  However, I have always used condensed milk instead of evaporated milk.  This may solve some of the problems of not gelling.  Hope this helps.

I've been making this for eons, taking over from my Mom after she made it for eons. I'm convinced that if you have any Midwestern roots, this jello salad is a standard at your holiday table. I came looking to make sure I had my measurements right (getting older just sucks).  I don't use the pecans but I do add a bit of horseradish or grated ginger for a little zip. We love this traditional dish and miss it if it's not on the table.  ... And just a little addition -- if you put ths in a round or wreath mold it turns out as a very pretty Christmas dish.  Decorate with a red fruit (my favorite is pomegranate) and it's done easy peasy!

This is something my grandmother made every holiday and my family loves it!  Granted I modified the recipe to replicate my grannys so here it goes, drain the pineapple, only use 1 box of jello (lime), no mayo.  turns out perfect!

Yes I have.  I used to make this for all our family gatherings over 20 years ago.  It was a joke, but everyone gobbled it up.  I had forgotten how to do it so I used this recipe.  However, I changed it a little.  I added a full container of cottage cheese and used Eagle Brand sweetened milk instead of evaporated milk.  Upon tasting, I was pleased that it was like my old recipe.  I didn't use nuts since some of my family is allergic.  I think the extra cottage cheese makes up for it. 
All in all, I had a trip down memory lane and a very good jello salad.

Every Christmas eve, my grandma would serve this jello salad at her meatless dinner. When she passed, I inherited many of her handwritten recipes; this was not among them. I have been searching for this recipe and had been making versions of this salad for several years now trying to get it right. I knew the minute I made this recipe that it was 'the one'. The only difference is grandma used walnuts instead of pecans. This past Christmas, I set up this jello salad in a traditional bundt pan (just like grandma used to). Once set, I placed the bundt in the sink surrounded by warm water for 5 minutes, then flipped it onto a dish. Then guests used a pie slicer to cut themselves a wedge of jello. Perfect!

I made this recipe as a trial run for Christmas dinner.  Very similar to the gelatin salad my mother-in-law used to make, and it was delicious.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  Next time I think I'll substitute pears for the pineapple.  Thanks for posting a recipe that holds wonderful memories!

Very good addition to Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't tell my family any ingredients bc I didn't want them to judge(they're NOT very adventurous eaters) .. big hit!!! Just the right amount of fruit as a side dish. Easy, impossible to mess up. P.S. i made it the night before.

My mother made this salad for the first time in the late 50's. It is called Sea foam salad and she made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year. I make it every year now for my family. I have never boiled the pineapple juice and used it because l was afraid the Jello would not set. I always boiled two cups of water and dissolved the Jello but this year,l will try the recipe with the pineapple juice.
