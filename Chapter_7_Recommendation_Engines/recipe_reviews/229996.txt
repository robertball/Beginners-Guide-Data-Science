I just made these this afternoon and thought they were really good. It's an easy recipe with basic ingrediants that were already in my kitchen. I didn't want to defrost my bacon, so I just added a handful of Hormel Real Bacon Bits and I also added a few dashes of hot sauce as I usually do with most recipes that have cheese in them. 15 minutes was just perfect time in my oven and I think they would get too dry pretty quickly if you baked them too long. I also baked them in paper cups to avoid sticking. These will be great for putting in the kids' lunches! Very Yummy!

These are one of the first to disappear when I make them for church. If you think they are bland, you can intensify the flavor by using a SHARP cheddar ( Swiss is good also) and using some of your bacon drippings for the oil.

This recipe made wonderfully moist muffins. I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and they taste good. My first reaction was that they were a little bland. However while I was thinking this, I ate 3 muffins! I just had another one. It tastes sort of like a cheese and bacon flavored biscuit. I would make and eat them again as is. I also think they would be great with green onions or a pinch of cayenne added in. They would be good to take to a brunch or even served with soup or chili. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will make them again.

These were good but could use a little umph (perhaps some green onions, chives or a few drops of hot sauce would do the tricks). They're best warm out of the oven or reheated.

Family loved these. I am wondering if you can do the same recipe and exchange bacon for breakfast sausage. Will definitely cook these again!

Really didn't like these.If they were called biscuits may have been better received.heavy crumbly texture not a bit like muffins. I made them to take to a luncheon (no time to make a replacement)there were lots of half eaten "muffins" left on plates.

YUM YUM YUM!  What a great recipe--awesome idea to make a more savory breakfast muffin, in place of the traditional sweet, cake-like ones.  I know this isn't exactly "healthy" (it's mostly flour, not egg), but still it is a WONDERFUL once-in-a-while breakfast treat!  This recipe got my family up and moving this morning for school.  Thanks--will definitely make again!  My only substitution was to add three chopped green onions in place of the garlic salt.

this recipe was easy and the ingredients are what most will normally have on hand. I read the reviews and added a few things. I added one finely chopped seeded jalepeno, about 1/2c more milk, used equal amounts of salt AND garlic powder and ommited the garlic salt. I dont think I would have liked the muffin as written but its a very good starting point

This recipe is a hit at parties. *Add much more cheese than the recipe prescribes.* It tastes a bit bland otherwise.

These muffins also taste good when reheated.

I have made this so many times and my family loves it. My new husband doesn't eat pork so I substituted turkey bacon. I just sliced it into small pieces and then fried it till crisp. Delicious!  Because it is such a large recipe I just make half   They freeze great too.

I was a bit disappointed - it really lacked the flavor I was expecting.  It definitely needs something else added.  I won't make again.

I reduced the portions for 6 servings, but really it only makes about 4. This is fine since it's just part of dinner for me and my husband tonight, but I'll keep that in mind and adjust a little for next time. I omitted the bacon because I wanted a mostly vegetarian meal tonight and used cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan with plenty of garlic and seasonings yet still found them a touch bland to be honest, though quite addictive anyway when paired with another recipe from this site, Creamy Pasta Bake with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil. Definitely a keeper, will make again with the bacon next time.

These are very dry, and the batter has no flavor. The bacon and cheese really are the only flavors and without them these would not be good at all. I used a sharp cheddar cheese and thick cut bacon and still they needed something. Very dry, so my husband toasted them and says it helps moisten them up. Very little flavor for the batter.

This recipe is a real keeper.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use 1/2 lb. bacon (because that's all I had) and I brushed the tops lightly with melted butter when they came out of the over.  These would be good served with any meal.

These are easy, fast and very filling, a good portable breakfast.  I made them exactly as the recipe said, but in the future will probably add some spring onions or chives, a bit of jalapeno or chilies, or even some canned corn, as they are a bit bland.  Also, as one other cook noted, they are more like biscuits than muffins, with a heavier crumb.  I thought that the bacon and cheese would have enough salt in them to augment the flavors, but they could use a bit more, in my opinion.  Overall, really good.  I have only a few left-overs and they will be gone at lunch. Thanks for yet another great recipe!!

The muffins are good, but unless I did something wrong,  the batter was more  like biscuit batter (dough) rather than muffin batter. I probably will make them as biscuits next time. . Still, the flavor is good. My son loved them!

I made exactly as stated in recipe and I found them very bland. They are definitely more similar to a biscuit than a muffin.
My toddler loved them though, so I will be remaking them probably with a dash of hot sauce or maybe a blend of cheeses to get some more flavor in them for myself.

The recipe gave a good guideline, and while I didn't change anything, I added more spices for flavour.  They turned out like dumplings and had that texture.  Definitely need more spice and salt added.

Easy to make and pretty tasty. The muffins are missing a bit of flavour but are really adaptable and would be a good recipe to spice up.

I make these often but a little different. I use real bacon bits which saves a lot of time. I also bake them as buns which is easier and the turn out flakier. My family loves them

I am giving this 4 stars as the taste was a bit bland to me. Loved the bacon in it.

OMGoodness!! Can I just say that these are the most delicious savory muffins! I made two batches of minis and had already had 3 before the second batch was in the oven. I will be making these over and over again. Thank you, LaurasFavs, for such a yummy recipe!
