So good! I am not a fan of quinoa, but thought Iâ€™d give it another try. The quinoa takes on the taste of the dressing - which is delicious!  I doubled the dressing.

This recipe is delicious , easy to make,  and very filling.   My son and I made it today for lunch.  The only change I made is I substituted baby spinach for the kale because I don't like kale.
