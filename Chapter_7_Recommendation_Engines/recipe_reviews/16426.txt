Rich, fluffy and full of fruity flavor. It's also simple and quick to make. I left out the nuts and used a bigger pie dish than called for, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Hubs liked it more than I did, calling it refreshing. I, on the other hand, thought it a little too rich, a little too sweet, and had too many flavors going on, so we'll settle at four stars between us. It doesn't take much to satisfy your sweet/fat tooth, so cut your pieces small!

I caught sight of this recipe while looking for a coconut pie for Mother's Day. I had a pre-made vanilla wafer crust left over from another occasion, so I thought what the heck. It was the biggest hit at Mom's house. I wished I had made two of them. I have made it three times since then as well, and my pie plate always leaves emptied. It is simple, no bake, yet still fills the kitchen with tropical flavor. Can be made to be a very attractive desert with toasted coconut and cherries.

This is just superb.  I've made it full bore and with low fat ingredients (cream cheese, cool whip, pineapple not in heavy syrup).  Of course - the full bore, full fat version is better.  But the low fat does work if you're worried about that.  Also - I prefer a graham cracker crust rather than vanilla wafer.  And I usually use 1 cup of toasted coconut - half to put in the pie and half to sprinkle on top.

I thought the recipe was delicious.  Although, I forgot to add in the nuts.  I had a shallow pie pan and had extra. So, I made individual servings in mini spring form pans and I FROZE them.  It made for great ice cream treat on a warm summer day.

I saw this recipe as I was trying to decide on a dessert for a Memorial Day BBQ.  It was really yummy!  I used a store bought shortbread crust and rum instead of rum extract. Toasted some extra coconut and put some in the pie and sprinkled some on top. Had extra filling and didn't want to throw it away, so I took someone else's advice and put it in a covered bowl in the freezer. One guy at the BBQ said the filling reminded him of Ambrosia Salad, and I agree. Great, cool pie on a hot day!

Delicious pie!  The local grocery store has a "Hawaiian Pie" that I was trying to copy.  This recipe is easy and turned out to be even better than the store's version.

Couple of changes:  I used a regular pastry pie crust to counter the sweetness of the pie and I eliminated the rum extract just because I didn't have any.

This pie was a cool treat on a hot day, and super easy.  The only thing I changed was used half vanilla wafers and half shortbread cookies for the crust.  I think it could use a little more rum flavoring, but still great just as the recipe is written.

I had to try this pie.  made it with a graham cracker crust and I didn't add the nuts.  I had my son try it, he doesn't even like pineapple and he absolutely loved it !  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe !

Left out the cherries and nuts in the pie. My Husband really loved this. I thought the flavour was nice but it was just a little too rich for me.

This was delicious. I made it for my boyfriends birthday. I left out the cherries, just because he doesn't like them. I added a little coconut to the mixture for the pie, and put lots of toasted coconut on top. I didn't think the rum flavor was too much or too little, but I didn't want that strong of a flavor, as other reviewers said. Great recipe! He loved it!

Fixed this [ie for family dinner and it was gone in a minute.  I did a pie crust to cut some of the sweetness.  Very easy and a big hit!

I've made this many times now with rave reviews from everyone that tries it.  I do add coconut extract to the cream cheese mixture and also make it with low fat ingredients and it does not affect the texture or taste. As others have said there is more than enough filling for one pie so I now make this in a 9x13 pan.

I loved this pie!  It is SO RICH!  My parents sampled it, and could not get over how flavorful it was.  Next time, I may substitute real rum for the imitation.

Iâ€™ve made this pie twice and both times they were delicious!  The first time, I used coconut milk because the store where I was didnâ€™t have cream of coconut.  Even though it wasnâ€™t sweetened, the pie was still good because of the other sweet ingredients.  I also used banana extract only because I donâ€™t like the taste of rum.
