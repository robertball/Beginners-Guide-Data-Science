Easy and delicious!  I used flour tortillas because that's what I had on hand.  I also used Laughing Cow garlic and herb cheese in place of the Neufchatel.  I added a little thin sliced red onion to these and they were great - perfect for nights when you don't feel like heating up the oven.

I had reduced fat cream cheese that I'd whipped into a spread using spices and my electric mixer--I used that instead of plain neufachatel cheese. I did add a little more inside the wrap to help the ingredients stick a little better. Delicious! I really loved that this wrap used romaine AND spinach.

Great way to use up my left over roast beef from last night. I used grated cheese since thats all I had. I also added green onion since they had to be used before they went bad. The neufchatel cheese could easily be replaced with cream cheese as well. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this one again.

Just like the description says, this is like a salad in a wrap so you're going to need dressing.  I used Ranch, but Italian, mayo, or even mustard would work just fine.

to those complaining that this is not a recipe....I, for one, like to see just how people 'build' their wraps and sometimes get some good pointers for assembling all the layers and 'how tos' for wrapping them.  thanks, Marty

These were a big hit at our house.  Made per the recipe except for omitting the neuchafel cheese.  Individuals added their personal choice of dressing (ie, honey-mustard, ranch, etc).  Went quite well with homemade tomato soup.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We followed the recipe with no changes. It was really a good recipe as well as a nice change from the standard sandwich.  Thanks you!

Great combination of meat and cheeses. Delicious, nutritious, and easy to make. What more can you want from a sandwich?

Made this just as it was written and it was very tasty !

to those complaining and reducing a rating by saying that this is a sandwich:  a sandwich is just a wrap with bread, and a wrap is pretty much a sandwich with a tortilla or lettuce. pretty much the same, but whether or not it be on bread or wrapped in a tortilla, the flavor is what matters with food and this was pretty darn tasty.

Very good.  We dipped ours in mustard or ranch dressing to give it a bit more flavor.
