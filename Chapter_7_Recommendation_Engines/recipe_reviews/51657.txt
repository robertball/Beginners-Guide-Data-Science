My wife makes this recipe all the time and it is simply fantastic.  I am vegetarian and have never tasted a stuffing this good.

I doubled the recipe for Christmas dinner and still used only 1 green bell pepper, I omitted the celery for personal tasted. I used fresh (crimini)mushrooms cause I don't believe in using canned shrooms (the flavor just isn't the same). I also added some fresh chopped spinach. I made the mistake of not crushing the cornflakes, but I added double the amount asked for instead and the stuffing still came out fantastic! 5 min before the cooking time had finished I topped the stuffing with some extra crushed cornflakes to give it a crunchy top. GREAT! Thanks for the recipe

My boyfriend HATES mushrooms, and so I exchanged the mushrooms in the stuffing for carrots and used cream of broccoli soup instead. I also substituted the bread crumbs for corn flakes and added chopped potato bread/croutons. Came out amazing, and my boyfriend loved it.

Not great, but it worked okay. Doesn't replace bread stuffing. Probably won't make again.

This recipe was fantastic. It may not be suitable for people who have really sensitive taste buds, but I absolutely loved it.

I made this for thanksgiving. Everyone said this was the best stuffing they have ever had. I used dried cranberries instead of canned mushrooms .
