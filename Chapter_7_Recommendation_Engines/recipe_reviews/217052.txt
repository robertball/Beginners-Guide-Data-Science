This is great!  The only thing different I did was use a pinch if nutmeg in place of the garam masala (simply because we didn't have any) and omitted the mushrooms (again, we didn't have any). Oh, and I doubled the garlic because we love garlic! Even my teenager had seconds!  This recipe will definitely be used again!  Yum!!

By far the most adventurous, yet easy thing I've prepared. It turned out beautiful and the family was very impressed. 
I added craisins instead of raisins and also some cayenne and jalapenos because we are spice-lovers here. 
I also used a meat thermometer because I was slightly worried about cooking the pork fully, but the recipe's time was right in line with what the meat thermometer read. 
CAMEAL, you rock! This is my all-time favorite recipe!

I was a little skeptical of the ingredients, but this was so easy and good! I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I replaced them with black currants. Delicious.

I have been wanting to cook with quinoa and this was my first attempt.  I thought this would be a good way to get reluctant family members to try it.  They all raved about it.  Serve with applesauce.  Yummy.

This recipe was very easy to follow.  I'm a big fan of quinoa and was looking for different ways to add it to my meal.  We made the pork tenderloin as close to the recipe as we could get it to be.  The only difference is we added prunes instead of raisins and pecans instead of pine nuts since we didn't have any of both at home.  

We also did what another reviewer did and substituted the garam masala with nutmeg.  And we smeared a little bit of apple butter on the outside of the pork tenderloin after we wrapped it.  We tried the quinoa stuffing mix before adding it to the pork tenderloin and felt it needed some salt, so we added a little into it as well. 

Overall, the pork tenderloin came out wonderful and moist.  We will definitely be using this recipe again!

I always try to make recipes as they are written; I think it's only fair.  With that said, I was disappointed with this one.  I found the quinoa mixture to be bland.  Should have had some seasonings in it.  The pork should have also been seasoned beyond a "pinch" as well, as salt and pepper can only go so far.

Yum! This was so good and even though it took some time it was super easy to make! I made exactly as recipe said but added a pinch of cayenne seasoning to the quinoa mixture. Do not cook any longer than 35 min it was plenty done. I served with green beans and apple sauce.
