Many compliments on this bread recipe. Minor changes> molasses instead of brown sugar when feeding the yeast in the first step (easier to mix), half wheat and half all purpose flour. In the future, I will make this with 3/4 of the dough in one bread pan, and use the leftovers for dinner rolls, as each half did not make such a large loaf as I like for slicing for sandwiches.

Delish! Has a regular wheat bread taste (like store bought) and I got a wonderful crisp crust on mine without doing anything special. I made it exactly as written except I did not need the last cup of flour in the recipe and instead of rolling it out I just shaped the loaves in the pan into rectangles that fit the pans.  Here's a tip: do not over rise for the second rising. If you let it rise for too long (more than 35 mins. or so) it will over rise and then deflate if you try to move it to the oven and it will be flat like mine!

Very good bread!  It is definitely kid friendly, because within minutes of taking this out of the oven, the smell got their attention and almost an entire loaf was gone within ten minutes.  I did do a few things different, but not so much to change the recipe, per se. I always use King Arthur flour or home-grinded.  In this case, I used KA flour, as it is far superior to all other brands, imo.  Used coconut oil for the vegetable oil; Rapunzel sugar instead of brown sugar; Himalayan salt; and raw milk.  The end results were delicious!  Oh yes, only used three cups plus 2 TBSP. of the whole wheat flour.  It's easy to know when you have added enough flour, if you're using a stand mixer with a dough hook.  The dough will come together and completely come away from the sides of the bowl.  It'll also come away from the dough hook (not be sticky to it) where the dough hook is only kneeding it.  If kneeding by hand, same thing, except with your hands, it won't be sticky to your hands anymore and will come away from them. Just a tip for anyone new to bread making.  :)  Do a search on bread making and you'll find all sorts of tricks of the trade!  Bread making is so much fun!

This bread came out fantastic. I don't have any bread making equipment so i kneeded the dough for about ten minutes prior to the first rising. It rose beautifully and i love the way the slits in the top look. I find that most breads become dense after cooling however this stayed quite fluffy. I don't have little kids at home but this was definately hubby friendly!

Easy to make, very delicious.  Not as sweet as a honey wheat bread, which I like.  Good wheat flavor.  I boil water in my teapot and fill an extra metal loaf pan 1/2 full with boiling water and then put it in the oven with the bread.  It makes the oven work more like a brick oven and gives the bread a real crusty crust, but I do this with all yeast breads (my hubby loves a good crust).  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

This was very good and easy to make - I used half AP flour and half wheat.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough and then let it rise in a warm oven (pre-heat to 200 degrees then turn OFF!) with a damp towel over bowl for an hour.  Shaped loaves (you don't need to roll out, just shape into a rectangle and plop in buttered pan) and baked as directed.  I really enjoyed the end result and this really is kid (baby) friendly as many wheat bread recipes contain honey and children under 1 year are not supposed to eat honey. These make great toast sticks for my little guy to enjoy.  Thanks!

This is so good.  It really is kid-friendly, too!  All of my babies just loved this and couldn't stay out of it.  I didn't need all of the flour- left out the last cup.  I used canola oil in this.  I wouldn't bake at 400 next time though- it got brown really fast and was a teensy bit dry on the ends.  I think 350 for the whole amount of time might be better.  I didn't follow the directions for shaping, but probably should have (my loaves looked funny).  I pulled this out of the oven at 5pm and the first loaf was totally gone 4 hours later.

Perfect sandwich bread! Soft bread & crust, but firm enough to hold up while slicing thinly for sandwiches & toast. 

I made 1 loaf & some sticky buns, since I had to roll it out, anyway. Both were a hit with my husband & 4 yr old. 

It didn't need to bake more than 30 min. in my oven (15min @ 400F, 10-15min @ 350F.)

The double loaf worked well in my kitchenaid. I used almost all of the flour. I rolled and tucked one and shaped the other into a loaf. The rolled and tucked one was much nicer and didn't stick to my pan but had huge holes in the loaf even though I rolled it tightly. I googled how to make french bread and the technique worked on this for rolling and tucking. It's more like fold and pound. This time there were no holes and it was great.. gone in 30 minutes. Also, need to remember 15 minutes at 400 and 30 at 350 or even less time if I don't want to burn this! Thanks!! :)

Followed the recipe quantities exactly, which resulted in an excellent bread. Just be sure to knead it long enough when using a Kitchen Aid mixer. This is now a standard in our kitchen.

Excellent, soft, fluffy, even textured and EASY.
My 3.5 year old helped me make this today.
It was fun and not much of a mess to clean up!  We used the dough hook and followed the recipe as-is.  Yummy, basic bread.

I don't know what would have to be different to rate this bread at less than 5.  Followed instructions and ended up with two perfect loaves.  
Now I'm off to try another recipe with less sugar and more grainy, grains.

This is a great recipe.  I like to bake my own bread rather than buying & I appreciate that this dough does not have to be kneaded very long... just leave it in the KitchenAide.  The bread comes out fabulous!!  I add 3 cups of wheat flour first & then add a little at a time to get the right consistency.  Definitely did not need all of the recommended flour.  I add a little flaxseed for a heart-healthy touch.  :)

Very good wheat bread.  Bf friendly too--He liked it and said it smelled good--and he's  not a wheat bread fan.  I used the breadmaker to make the dough, then baked at 375 for 45 min.  Nothing against this recipes directions, but 375 and 40-45 min works best for breads in my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out Great.  Had to use white sugar because I was out of brown.  Shaped the dough like Italian loafs and put cornmeal on the bottom of the pan.  It was great...

My loaves turned out perfectly! Sliced better then any bread I've made before as well. And oddly enough my 6 year old (without being prompted) said "Wow I hate crust but I'll eat this crust!" you were dead on with this recipe, thank you!

This bread turned out pretty good.  It was my first time baking again after a long illness, and I was pretty happy with the results.  I did everything as the recipe describes, except I doubled the recipe and made it into 3 large loaves (instead of 2 loaves per single recipe).  I also added milled flax seed and sunflower seed to one loaf.  The seed loaf was a little more crumbly than the rest, but still delicious.  The only complaint I had was that the crust was a little over done and crumbly.  This made the bread a little harder to slice.  No one but me noticed this & they gobbler it up.  I will use this recipe again, but perhaps not a double batch, as it burned out my Kitchen Aid.

What a great bread!  No honey, so I can share it with my almost 10 month old.  It's delicious.  Smells great while cooking.  Only sad bit is my Kitchenaid motor started smoking while mixing :(  I think this is the winner in my search for a bread to make weekly :)

Excellent recipe!  I made a double batch today.  Found I didn't use as much flour as was called for, and used more of the wheat than all purpose.  And I don't have a mixer, so everything was done by hand.  I no longer buy bread...I make all my own, and this is a wonderful addition!

Made the dough in my bread machine (no mixer) and baked in the oven.  Success!  I had to half it because I didn't realize how low I was on yeast, but I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great.  And my 2 year old loves it.  Thanks!

After never being able to find a store-bought bread that the whole family enjoys, I tried this recipe.  It has now become a staple in our home.  I make it every week and every one loves it.  It makes great toast as well.  Thank you!

We loved this recipe.  My five kiddos are hard to please...especially when it comes to whole wheat. I added a bit of honey and substituted a cup of the whole wheat flour for bread flour. I really liked the density. We had ours with garlic honey.  Delicious.

This recipe wasn't bad, just wasn't my favourite.  I like more dense bread than this.  It is very light, and my crust came out quite tough, especially the bottom.  Not overcooked, just hard.  The flavour is good, but not awesome.  Thanks for the recipe though :)

I'm a novice bread baker, but have been baking this recipe for several months now. I'm so pleased with it! The bread holds up well over time, it freezes well, and I think it makes terrific sandwiches.  I usually tip in about 1/4 cup each wheat bran and toasted wheat germ, just to add a little more nutritional oomph, and I think it adds a little more flavor, too.

Excellent recipe. I got soft fluffy bread. I live at high altitude and its very dry here, so could incorporate only 2 cups of all-purpose flours & 3.25 cups of whole wheat flour. Will definitely make this again and again and again... thank you!

This was sooooo good!  I made it just like it said, except that I used molasses instead of brown sugar to add to the warm water and yeast.  My picky 2 year old loves it and so do I!

My goal this year is to bake with yeast and make bread.  This was my second attempt - the first ended up in the trash.  This recipe was just what I was looking for as I wanted to use my mixer.  I made it exactly as listed, and it was perfect.  I did have to let it rise for longer, but that always depends on where you're rising it and how warm the spot is.  I rise under a kitchen under-cabinet light.  The bread is soft and not very dense.  I will make this bread again but throw in some flax seeds, cracked wheat etc.  Thanks for listing this perfect, basic wheat bread recipe.

This bread is amazing.  I made it just as directed.  My friend had brought over 2 loaves of home made white bread and I made 2 loaves of this wheat bread.  The wheat bread was gone before the white!  My kids are aged 3-11 and they all raved about it.  No more store bought bread for us.  I'm making it again, but I will try to use molasses instead of the brown sugar and add a little wheat bran to it.  Yummmm.  This recipe is a winner!

This is a very nice wheat bread recipe - and it is quick.  My loaves turned out beautiful and soft.  I have tried a bunch of different wheat recipes trying to find "the one."  Well, I think this is it.  (My one year old loved it)

Pretty easy to make. Turned out well  and had a good texture, but it was a bit bland. Maybe use a pinch more salt.

I was excited to try this recipe, but ended up being a little disappointed. It was easy enough to make (used my stand mixer), but the flavor is pretty boring. Usually I enjoy having a slice of plain bread or toast. I'll keep trying other bread recipes, thanks for submitting this one!

This bread is fantastic! Very easy to make, the only problem I had was that my loaf was a little flat, which seems to happen to me a lot when I make bread. I think next time I'll use bread flour instead of the all purpose and see if that helps. I will be making this a lot.

I used coconut oil in the recipe and did not need to add more flour after mixing it with the first given amount. I do not have a stand mixer and did everything by hand. It was super easy and the bread turned out delicious and perfect ! So good!

It was dry. I believe it has too much flour or not enough moisture. I added some milk but probably not enough.

I have been making my own bread for 40 years. I have never found a whole wheat recipe that I really liked. I have found some that were okay but not that really tasted great. This is great wheat bread. It will be my go to one from now on. Be careful adding your flour. I used a full cup LESS than called for in the recipe.

Awesome and easy.  But like mcmeg12 recomends, next time I will use 3/4 of the batter for the bread and use the leftover dough for rolls, etc.  Using 1/2 the batter makes a loaf that is too small.  Definately making this again!

Wow!  This is the best bread I have ever made.  My husband and family agree and they can't stay out of it.  The flavor and texture is so good that it doesn't even need butter.  I followed the recipe exactly but instead of making 3 large loaves in bread pans I made 4 round loaves on a cookie sheet.  I used one for dinner and then put the rest in the freezer for later.  This will definitely become a stable in our home.

This is my first time baking a bread and this one turned out perfectly moist and tasty. I halved the recipe and added rosemary and virgin olive oil to mine as an addition. Hubby loved it...so a win win :)

Really good bread.  Mine didn't rise how it was supposed to, but I'm sure it was something I did.  I used 3 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white bread flour.  Will make again.

This was my first time making bread!  The recipe was easy to follow and the bread came out great.  Next time, however, I would add a touch of honey to give it a little more flavor.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I'm terrible at making bread, but finally my bread came out great, my family even asked me to make it regularly.  Very easy and delicious.

Tried this recently, and it was a big hit.  The bread slices very well and has a slightly sweet taste.
My kids eat it plain and think it's a treat.  I'm very glad to have found this recipe!

I made this bread as written except for forgetting to listen for the oven alarm at the end of baking!  Woops!!!  Well It still turned out delicious.  The crust was a little tough but the center was amazing!  I'm 99.9% sure the crust would have been perfect if I would have paid a little closer attention;)  Being new to bread making (the second recipe I tried (the first one I have been successful at) I found this recipe to be easy and a great way to understand how every step it is suppose to look becasue the discription in the recipes were perfect!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!

I used what I had in house to make this bread. So I end up useing regular sugar.  I don't think I kneed my bread right or something.  As rised both times perfectly but sank when stuck in oven in sank any ideas why?  I am new with cooking with wheat my frist time.  I made half this recipe as just for me.  I to added no salt. Don't think caused it though. As I make white bread all time without salt.  Very delicious.  But mine end up heavy and no lil holes. Like shown in picture. Will defently be trying agin. Nexts time going get some brown sugar maybe why caused it idol lol. Great recipe.

Awesome bread as is (though I prefer butter instead of oil).  Great for sandwiches, including Peanut butter and Jelly's.  And it's a great blank canvas if you want to get creative, (like adding flax seeds, etc).

Absolutely delicious! The kids, 8, 6 and 3 all fought for the last piece (but I had already eaten it) It does make two quite small loaves, will try doubling it next time or just using one loaf tin. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

I've been making a wheat bread recipe that requires soaking overnight, much kneading, etc. This one was much easier and tasted better, with a texture we preferred as well. I made it as written my first time to form a baseline impression. I think next time I'll try to cut down the refined sugar by adding honey to replace the 1/3 cup of sugar. This replaces our gourmet wheat bread recipe for sure.

This was the first time I have ever made bread, it went really well with this recipe. It was easy and everyone loved it! I had a friend and her kids over when I was making it and they refused to leave before it was done because it smelled so good cooking they had to have some!! I am sure I will be making this many many times, I only have half a loaf left and I made it this afternoon! I also didn't need the last cup if flour, but made it exactly to the recipe otherwise.

I have NEVER made bread before & am fairly new to *real* cooking. (read: most of my meals come in a box & are tossed in the oven)  I was happy with how the loaves turned out and received rave reveiws from family.

I really wanted to love this bread ... it was easy to make, it made a beautiful loaf, but, overall, I just didn't love it ... the taste and texture were okay, and it made great French toast, but it just wasn't what I was looking for, I guess ... it is dense, which is why it works so well for French toast ... and, I think it would be good to use for stuffings and things like that ... but, as a sandwich bread ... not so much ... thanks, tho'!

This was my first attempt at making yeast bread--I finally got a stand mixer--and this recipe was perfect! I brushed melted butter on the tops after I took them out of the oven. The house smells great and the bread is yummy! After adding the initial amounts of flour, I only had to add 1/3 c. more of white and 1/2 c. more of wheat. Thanks for the easy to follow recipe!!

Easy to follow, easy to make recipe.  First time I followed the shaping instructions (poorly) with unattractive results.  Second time, I didn't roll it out and it turned out perfectly.  The second time I made this bread I used bread flour in place of all purpose and I got a little lighter loaf (which my husband likes)  Thanks for this recipe... I'll be making home made bread from here on out!
