We enjoyed with recipe, but I cut way back on the Oil and Butter (more like 3/4 c oil and 1/4 of butter)and the cook time indicated in the recipe would have been way too long and would have resulted in very dry chicken.  I would suggest no more than 35-45 minutes total depending upon your oven and the size of your chicken pieces.  the flavors were very good and we will make this again.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Well I did it my way and this is what I found.
Best to make sure your Paprika is as fresh as possible. 
At the end I did not like all the oil at the top of my measuring cup so discarded most of it. Then used a immersion blender to make an emulsion along with some Lemon Juice for acid.

This was a pretty tasty dish. I took other's suggestions to cut back on the oil and butter and used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I was afraid that the amount of garlic the recipe called for would be too overwhelming, so I used about half. While that amount of garlic was good, the full amount would have been best. So don't be afraid to garlic it up! This is easy to make and could easily be worked into the weeknight rotation.

Wonderful recipe that is full of flavor! The paprika and garlic make it a hearty meal, especially during the fall and winter. True Spanish comfort food. :-)

I’ve made it a number of times because it’s something that the whole family will eat, and I have some very selective clients. I also cut back on the butter and oil, but also doubling the chicken to feed the whole family. I usually end up cooking it longer to make sure it’s done when I crowd the pan like that. I often serve it with patatas bravas and a tossed salad for a good match of flavours. This meal has become a family favourite.

Nothing special, not a lot of flavour and much too greasy for my liking. It wasn't terrible but I wont be making it again, there are much more tasty chicken recipes out there.

I expected more flavor from this dish after reading the reviews, but was disappointed. I did need so much oil for dipping.
