I used a pound of ground turkey that I spiced up to fake pork sausage (rubbed sage, marjoram, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, basil red pepper flake, salt/pepper) and I cut back on the flour to a quarter cup only because I didn't want a thick soup. I also used a homemade onion soup mixture as I am sensitive to MSG and most pre-packaged onion soup mix has MSG. This was good. For us, it had a little too much cream. I would use more broth next time and cut the cream back considerably.

This soup is excellent. Mine came out extremely thick so I doubled the broth and still thought is was a little thick so I added about three more cups of broth. It was still rich and creamy. I also used milk instead of half and half. Very tasty. My family and I really enjoyed this. I will absolutely make this again.

Yum!  Very good soup.  It turns out like a rich tomato bisque, actually, with tortellini.  I did make a few changes based on what we had on hand.  I don't have or use half and half because I'm lactose intolerant; instead, I used skim milk (the only milk I can stomach) and it was fine, dried basil bc I have no fresh, and left out the sausage.  Unlike others, I didn't modify the flour amount but did add a cup more chicken broth (my cans have two cups and I didn't want to deal with half a can) and left out the sausage.  I think it would be good with sausage, but I don't think it's necessary.  This soup has a lot going on already and is rich enough we didn't miss the meat.   Very good with bread, or grilled cheese as we had it with.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is definitely a winner..  As with other reviewers,  i too used a bit more broth ( 48 oz ).  I also used red cooking wine because the spirits store was closed.  The only other change i made was with the half/half.  I used 1 cup of half/half and a cup of 2% milk.  Thanks so much for such a delicious recipe.

This soup was amazingly delicious and deserves more than 5 stars!!! I used milk in place of the half and half, only 1/4 cup flour, dried basil instead of fresh (grocery store was out) and added a 1/2 tsp. oregano. Love this soup and will make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

We really loved this.  Only added 1/2 cup of the flour but added a handful or parm at the end to the soup. Also threw in the left over stock from the box, probably 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp oregano.  Will definitely make this again!

This is so delicious!  The only change I would make is instead of making it as a soup, I'd pour it over tortellini (more like a sauce) instead of adding the tortellini to the soup.  As a soup, it is very thick and quite rich.  But it really was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

I'm giving it 4 stars. This recipe is such a great jump start recipe to add your own twist. I used chicken which was awesome. I didn't add the onion soup mix, instead used a onion blend I had from our local spice shop .  I also added some heat. Cut the half and half by half. It's was still super thick. We will make this again for sure.

As others did, I reduced the flour and added 2 more cups of broth. I also did half skim milk with half cream, and substituted turkey sausage in. Reduced the calories a bit, but still full of flavor and will definitely be made again!

Very nice. I listened to other reviewers and reduced flour to 1/2 cup, used 1% milk instead of half-n-half and added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano. I also added one can of condensed tomato soup because the tomato flavor was a little overpowered by the Italian sausage. I'll definitely be making this again.

My family couldn't get enough of this soup!  My sixteen year old daughter said, "Mom, you need to make this every week!"  I also added 2x's the amount of broth and wine.  Next time, I think I will follow along with other suggestions and cut down the flour a bit.  But still.... yummy and perfect on a cold winter day!

This actually came out more like a pasta bake then a soup - but a few minor adjustments and it can be!  But - as written, the recipe is delightful.

Dee-lish! I, like just about everyone else, put in just a 1/4 cup of flour, and made my own little meatballs, instead of italian sausage. Fantastic!

This was really good. 3/4 cup flour would have been a lot though. I used about 1/4 cup and it was still quite thick to me. I also less liquid though, about 2.5 cups broth and 1 cup half n half, because that's what I had. It was creamy enough for me, though the 2 cups would probably have been fine too, I think. I also forgot to buy the sausage for this. I liked it a lot without it and can't decide whether I think I'd like it more or less with the sausage. I think it'd add nice flavour but I'm not overly big on meaty soups; if I were to make this with sausge, I'd definitely only use 2 or 3 links. I also only bought one package tortellini; it was plenty. The wine added really nice flavour. I was worried it might be too much because it was all I could smell while the soup was simmering, but it wasn't overpowering at all. I added quite a bit of parmesan cheese on top, it was delicious melting into the soup. All in all, I enjoyed very much, thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious, but I did make a few adjustments in amounts...I only used 1/2 cup flour, and probably could've used even less, and I used a whole carton (32oz.) of chicken broth. My only other change was to reduce the half & half (I used heavy cream b/c that's what I had) to 1 cup, and that was the perfect consistancy for us. This is a super flavorful, hearty soup that I will def be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added:  
¼ C. olive oil
½ onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
a little extra salt
1 tsp. turmeric
¼ tsp. red pepper flakes
1 C. extra chicken broth (32 0z.)
1 C. water

I omitted:
Sausage
½-and-½ cream

I substituted:
Basil paste for fresh basil
Minced garlic in a jar for fresh garlic
Crushed tomatoes with added basil for plain
1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar for red wine
Herbed Chicken Tortellini for cheese tortellini

Wonderful and versatile! Very complex flavors for such an easy recipe. My new go-to year-round favorite soup!

My family of 6 liked this. I omitted the red wine &  added an additional cup of broth. This is a thick soup but very tasty. I had to convince my tomato hater that this wasn't super tomato-y and once he tried it, he agreed! I will probably make this again.

Fantastic soup.  I was questioning the addition of onion soup mix, but it works.  My husband loved it and ate it three days in a row and then asked me to make it again.

Fabulous recipe. I added a lot more chicken stock than the recipe called for but it just made more soup and it was even better the next day. Definite keeper.

Decided to rate this soup finally since I have made it several times. (Delish!!) My family really likes it, we have it with grilled sourdough cheese sandwiches. It is so good, but make sure you use less flour, more broth if you want it like a soup. Recipe itself is more a bisque. Enjoy.

Holy cow this was amazing!!!  I used a little less flour as suggested.  I also added carrots and peas, as per our taste.  This will go in our regular rotation, I wanted to write a review so someone else tries this!!!!  Can't say enough how great this was.

This recipe is so good! I did not add the sausage, but did everything else the way it was written. It was so delicious, my husband kept saying it smelled delicious while it was cooking. This is definitely going to be a frequent meal in my house.
