I have always liked the original version of this recipe and I liked this too, but I don't know how much 'healthier' it is.  I used about 4 large carrots and a whole smallish onion - a lot more celery than is called for.  Add what ever vegetables you have available.  This is one of those great comfort meals - enjoy but don't think it is that much 'healthier'.

This soup turned out wonderful!!  I think I used this recipe more as a guide..
Used the ham bone from my New Years ham to make a stock- covered the bone in water in a stock pot and let it simmer for about 3 hours.  Then used that as my base.  Added celery, onion, carrot, and potatoes- cooked.  Then added roux.  I also added a little garlic, salt, chicken boullion, and cayenne pepper.  
My first time cooking potato soup & it will definitely not be the last!!

My mom and I just made a pot of this potato soup
for dinner.It is very good.I didn't have any chopped
Ham so I used Hillshire Sausage instead.I used can cut green beans
because I didn't have any fresh ones.The amount of vegetables
were lowered because of the amount of juice.I also used less
butter and flour.I added a tablespoon of corn starch.I also
added some whipping cream.I seasoned to taste with salt pepper and seasoning salt.This recipe is certainly a keeper.

My husband and two kids all really liked this soup.  I didn't even add the milk/flour.  I found that once I used a masher to mash up the potatoes, the soup was plenty thick and creamy.  Also I used a spiral ham that had enough salt, so I skipped the bouillon.  I added fresh dill and parsley too.  So with less salt and no milk, it was even healthier/low calorie.

This was tasty!  I glanced at the recipe thinking I had everything, but was very wrong.  I had to butcher it because I was out of so much.  I subbed a leek for celery, shallot for onion, chicken broth for bullion/water and cornstarch for flour.  I had only about 1 Tbs butter and made that work too.  For being so short on some key ingredients, it turned out great!  It's also good to know I could make it with much less butter and it still tasted wonderful!  Next time I will be sure to have flour, otherwise I kinda like the revisions I had to make.  I had to use a little more than a cup of milk but that may be due to the cornstarch.

I decided to leave out the flour and milk like cpolis said and it turned out good. It was more of a stew that way, but I expected that. The problem with doing it without flour and milk is that it is a ton of butter; next time I'll probably half it. The other problem is that there is no way you can realistically feed 8 people with as much as it makes. I would say it is closer to 4 or 6 servings.

Followed the recipe pretty much.When doing the roux with flour & blending in the milk,it just wasn't thick enough. So I added some corn starch to thicken it up more when cooking.After adding the Roux to the Pot, I tried the soup,It was good,but I wanted to kick it up a notch.I added Sour Cream.What a Nice added flavor.I first added some to my test bowl of soup.It was so good.Then I added the Sour Cream to the whole Pot.Add a bit at a time to your liking,or not at all.It's great both ways.

This soup was great for my picky family. Everyone had seconds. Good hearty soup for a winter evening. I used vegetable broth instead of water.

Love it! I changed it up just a bit. I had some sweet potatoes that needed to be used so I used them also. I cooked the carrots, onions, celery, with salt and pepper, in a little olive oil. I did this before following the rest of the recipe. It is wonderful. I am looking forward to serving it with cheesy wheat bread.

This was delicious!  My husband said it was the best potato soup he's had.  We didn't add the green beans because all we had were canned beans and I didn't think that sounded very good.  I will probably experiment with this a little bit- my husband wants to add peas.

So I just made this and, holy smokes! It's so good!The White pepper adds this addictive spice that I can't get enough of. I had to tweak it a little because I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have carrots or ham. I put in a whole bag of peas added a lot more potatoes and only used around 2 Tablespoons butter. Oh and I tossed in one fresh Jalapeno. 
I will be making a few batches of this and freezing it! 
I! LOVE! IT! lol

Really good. Added a sweet potato, only used 1 TB butter, 2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 c edamame, added enough chicken broth to cover ingredients. Came out great except a little too spicy because of amount of white pepper. Will use regular pepper next time.

I made this for my family last night. The only thing I left off were the green beans. For the Ham I used a Ham Bone I had in the freezer. My family thought this was wonderful and there was not any left! The only added thing I did was use my immersible blender to blend it a bit.

My husband and I really enjoyed the soup. His words were this is a "soup that sticks to your bones". Served with side salads. I will definetely cook again. By the way I didn't have any white pepper so I substituted black pepper and the taste was great. The pepper specks did not ruin or look unappealing to us.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was delicious. Only problem is that it took way longer to cook because I had to keep whisking in more flour and then corn starch, as others did,  to thicken the sauce. I will make adjustments in the beginning to speed it up.

Excellent soup recipe!! I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the veggies and ham. I added honey Dijon mustard to the roux before I added a can of coconut milk instead of regular milk because I’m non dairy and I think it tastes richer. I will absolutely make this again!

Very delicious and easy to make. The only change we made to the recipe is we added way more ham. This is definitely going on the list of cold weather dinners.

The soup was flavorful and creamy! I made a vegetarian version not adding ham and the soup still had a good flavor.

Great soup and quick to make! I used chicken broth instead of water and added corn, carrots and ground turkey instead of ham. My family loved it! Thank you!

We loved it-it's in the saved /make again  category. I added about   50% more vegetables and a pinch of red pepper flakes the leftovers were great.

It might not remain as healthy, but adding some crispy smoked bacon to the soup or sprinkling as garnish adds to the delicious factor. Also, used smoked ham, added another layer.

I think this is a Great base recipe! I use whole milk or heavy cream an omit the butter and beans. That's just a personal preference. All 3 of my boys LOVED this and my picky husband asked for a repeat!

It was a little bland at first.  I added salt, pepper, chicken stock,  and crushed red pepper.  I would make it again, but would work on adding more flavor. Texture was perfect, it was very creamy!

My family loved this recipe! I love that I can use milk instead of going to the store just to buy cream for the other Potato Soup recipes.

Sooo good! We have made it twice and will make it again. Part of why we love it is that it's a wonderful comfort food, but not heavy. Doesn't weigh us down. Second time we used beef bouillon cuz we were out of chicken. Still delish!

I made this without the dairy and flour - it was great!  I was surprised by how spicy it turned out to be.  Usually add extra pepper but am glad I stuck to the recipe for that.

I did not use the butter, milk, or flour. I used vegetable and chicken stock, increased the carrot, green beans, and onion. For seasonings, I added a little allspice and Marsalla. Really tasty. Jane.Braun

Love this reciepe. Been making it for years I was hoping to get a healthier version without loss of flavor.  I don't think this did it.   I sauté onions veggies, ham and ham bone first. Then add chicken stock or bullion with water. Make sure to cook the butter an flour in separate pan before adding that keeps the pasty flavor away.   Bone really helps with flavor as the sauté does. Enjoy your comfort dish not a healthy version good try
