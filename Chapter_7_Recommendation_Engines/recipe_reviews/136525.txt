Loved, loved, loved this! The seasonings are classic and perfect but it was the cooking method that particularly impressed me.  I generally prepare shrimp this way in a skillet on the stove top, but this was just too easy!  What was really kind of cool was that I used three shrimp apiece as an appetizer for our grilled steak dinner using small gratin dishes that looked so pretty on the serving plate along with the steaks!  For additional flavor and color I added chopped fresh chives from my garden and sprinkled the shrimp with paprika. I know I'll be repeating this as an easy and delicious appetizer regularly.

A good basic recipe, but bland. I would add lemon juice, white wine, perhaps some Dijon mustard.  I had large shrimp on hand, so put in 1 more tbsp of olive oil, 1 more tbsp of butter and 1 additional garlic clove, but still needed a bit more pizzaz; I will make it again the the additions above and see if it has more zing.

Simple and basic, also very good and easy.  This is a quick fix meal with some pasta and garlic bread.  Can easily change it up by adding white wine or some herbs to get more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

My first time ever making Shrimp Scampi.  I made this tonight for an appetizer while my dinner was cooking.  This was quick, simple and easy.  The next time, I will have it as the main course but I will add some fresh parsley, white wine, broccoli, and fresh parmesan cheese, served on top of some pasta along with garlic bread and a side salad.  Yummy!!!

5 stars because it passed my 3 major tests: is it simple/easy to prepare? Yes. Is it delicious? Yes.  Do my kids love it? Yes.  Toss it over some pasta, and presto you are done. : )

Very good, I thought the garlic was a bit too strong but otherwise I enjoyed the method and the taste.  I added a sprinkle of panko bread crumbs mixed with some fresh parmesan cheese on the top before baking.  Made a nice "crust".  I'll make it again with a bit less garlic than what's called for.

Very very simple and very very tasty. I did make 2 minor modifications: I added fresh basil from my herb garden and freshly squeezed lemon juice to the marinade.

We made this on the grill instead of the oven and it was a huge hit at my son's family birthday celebration (which was during Lent). Everyone, including my super picky, all Organic sister, was asking for the recipe. This is the only way we make shrimp now.

This was great!  The scampi was quick and easy to make AND tastes fantastic.  My only additions were: adding approx 1/2c Italian dressing to the marinade for some extra flavor, and topping the shrimp with a mixture of Italian & Panko bread crumbs and a few shakes of parm cheese before baking.  While the scampi was in the oven, I boiled some linguine, tossed it in couple Tbsps of butter and garlic salt, add garlic bread, and voila! A quick weeknight meal a la Italian bistro.

I didn't feel like the sauce would be enough so I added some more olive oil, some dijon mustard, white wine and parsley.  Its was AMAZING!

I added more seasonings and made it 5 stars.  If you don't add salt and pepper or seasoned salt and pepper, it's a bit bland.

Skipped the butter, didn't measure out the other ingredients, and it still came out fabulous!  added broccoli and baked the shrimp/broccoli together, served over quinoa.

I used this mostly to see what ingredients I should use.  I still cooked it on the stove because I had tiny cooked (but frozen) shrimp.  I wanted to serve it over linguine so I added some wine for more sauce.  It was nice and went fast.  Thanks for sharing!

We really loved this dish! The cooking method was much easier than the traditional sauteed method. All I had to do was put everything in a casserole dish and let it bake for 15 minutes. The baking method was approximate as was the ingredients, measurements and directions. The flavor was buttery and tasty. I sprinkled fresh minced Italian flat leaf parsley for added flavor and color.

I made this for dinner last night.  I baked the shrimp in the marinade, because I couldn’t see that marinating for only ten minutes would do much of anything.  I did deviate from the recipe by adding 2T. of dry white wine which added a nice subtle flavor.   If I were to make this again, I’d marinate for a longer time and grill rather than bake them.

Used Irish garlic herb butter instead and added fresh chopped parsley - BIG HIT! Have always wanted to find an easy and flavorful recipe and this was it. I will be making for our family for years to come :)

This is my favorite way to prepare shrimp.  Certainly the easiest. The first time I tried this I could not believe how good the shrimp were.  I served this to a shrimp snob--said he had never had such wonderful shrimp in his life.  And he is a senior citizen.

SUPER EASY TO MAKE! instead of placing shrimp in a pattern, I just put them straight from the bowl into a 13x9 pan and put it into an oven. next time I'm going to add some lemon juice and more pepper.

Loved this. I made it exactly as written the first time and was impressed.  The second time I added 1T of white wine and 1/4 t of parsley and it was amazing. We have shrimp at least once a week and I have  never considered marinating it. Thanks Trailindaw.  I will be using this recipe again and again.

Wonderful!!  My new "go to recipe."  I used the 16 to 20 count large prawns.  They still cooked perfectly in 15 minutes.  Exquisite!!

Soo easy and sooo good. I did add lemon as well. My biggest challenge is making dishes my very picky step son will eat. He had no problem eating a large majority of this dish! Next time i'll be doubling it.

This is my boyfriends favorite meal.  I usually triple the marinade.  I get a pound and a half of uncooked shrimp.  I make the marinade first, place shrimp in marinade while oven in heating.  Then I pour all marinade and shrimp into a 9 x13 dish and place in oven for 15 min (no need to turn shrimp, they will cook perfect without stirring them)  while in oven I boil and cook linguine.  When shrimp is complete I pour whole dish over my pasta and toss.  DELICIOUS!!!

Be careful not to undercook or overcook the shrimp. This makes a great appetizer if you stick some toothpicks in it.

This is the best way to cook shrimp! No more skillet shrimp for me, as I always overcooked it. Nice blend of seasonings that don't overpower the flavour of the shrimp. I served the shrimp on pasta with alfredo sauce and broccoli, and it was yummy. Perfect texture. I will always cook shrimp this way now.

First time making shrimp scampi and it was really wonderful! I boiled up some linguine to serve with it and used the left over butter, oil, garlic mix as the sauce with it, that the shrimp was in. It was so YUMMY!

Very yummy! We thought it was great :) I followed the recipe, but did add a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. I don't know if that made a difference or not, but my family all enjoyed this dish.

Simple and easy - I had to change the servings to 5 to accommodate my family and probably used half the amount of butter called for.  I also used sea salt and had to adjust up to our liking for flavor otherwise it would have been too bland.  I served this over pasta with parsley and parm cheese.  Kids loved it, so it's a keeper for  me.

I used the frozen cooked and peeled shrimp that i thaw out, baked for 10 minutes and it turned out ok on flavor but the shrimp got hard so i definitely do not recommend using the same shrimp i used. I didn't have any uncooked shrimp when i made this so next time i will try it with uncooked shrimp and maybe it will turn out better.

7 22 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/136525/sexy-shrimp-scampi/ ... Good good!  K & S liked this better than the other one I made, same night ... I liked that one, shrimp scampi bake, better; but they are both very good!  The sauce on this one, sexy, is more rich - olive oil - than the other.  Very good, very easy.

Note: If the shrimp are starting from frozen, you'll need significantly longer than ten minutes in the oven.  I suggest 400 degrees and covering the top of the casserole dish loosely with foil so the shrimp gently steam with the butter.

I used a lot more spices on the shrimp. I like it a lot spicier though. Turned out great. Used cilantro instead of parsley for more of a "Mexican" taste. Great dish. Fed two of us with two leftover meals for myself at work!

It was amazing. After having a few failures at making my own shrimp dishes, this experience was a breath of fresh air, especially for a amateur cook.

Loved making scampi in the oven..no stovetop to clean! Doubled oil and butter because I was putting it over a lb. of thin spaghetti. Added a good pinch of red pepper flakes and after mixing with pasta topped with fresh parsley and grated parmigiana reg cheese and juice of a lemon. Hubs just grunted like a cave man and had THREE helpings! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good! I'm not much of a shrimp fan but I felt like I was eating something from a restaurant, not my home! I added a bit more of everything but the oil so that I would have more sauce and paired it with noodles, in the same sauce.  Phenomenal and so simple, thank you!

This was incredible! Like other reviewers I added some fresh lemon juice (about 1/4 of a lemon) and some fresh chopped parsley. 7 minutes on each side and these large shrimps turned out to be amazeballs!

I used 1/2 lb of large shrimp vs 30 medium shrimp.  Added a dash of white wine and red pepper flakes to the butter mixture.  I prepared this ahead of time and left it in the fridge for about 2 hours before baking.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Made it tonight for supper and while it was good, it was a bit bland.  Next time, I’ll add more garlic and salt and maybe add some oregano.  But it was super fast and easy to throw together.
UPDATE: increased salt to 1.5 tsps salt, 3 big cloves garlic and 1/4 tsp oregano....Delicious!

Not bad. I mixed everything together in the same dish I was going to bake it in. I skipped the olive oil and didn't miss it. Less butter would have worked just fine, too. Easy and quick.

My wife did not care for this dish. . she was unable to articulate
a specific reason for her opinion.
In my own defense, I must say, the dish was properly prepared in accordance with the recipe's  instructions.

I followed directions as shown accept I used jar garlic. To me this recipe is too bland. I will say that maybe I should have used more of the garlic in the jar. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised if there are only a handful of ingredients. I'll try again and double up on garlic and maybe add some white wine.

Overall pretty good easy recipe. Next time I would add more garlic but I used the jarred kind and I don’t think it’s as potent as the fresh. I would also double the marinade so I could put it over pasta. The great part is it’s super easy to put together.

I enjoyed it,  but I'm adding more butter the next time.   Got "dry" rather quickly  so I think more butter will remedy that.

Very good, I followed the directions but dyed Asparagus! I can see using less butter and substitute Evoo.  My Italian friends would abject to using cheese with shrimp however the addition of avocado was great.

Made this after reading comments of other reviewers, so I took some their suggestions to add some wine, lemon and panko crumbs for crunch.  I did take off the tails as my husband doesn't like doing that.   Let the shrimp marinade for about a half hour in the sauce before baking.  Served over bow tie pasta with a little shredded Parmesan cheese and some rosemary garlic bread.  It was his birthday dinner and he had 2 helpings.    I think as written, it'd be very good, but the suggestions makes it 5 star.

Very tasty.  I added a little white wine and dried chives.  The shrimp we used were jumbo.  My husband loved it.  I would probably use a little more garlic next time.

This is a super easy and extremely tasty way to cook shrimp.  I have used it for scampi, but it is also great for any recipe that has shrimp in it, like shrimp Alfredo, risotto and even shrimp over steamed rice.  My super picky teenage girl loves this, and so does my husband, who works in a very upscale restaurant and has pretty particular tastes.  Definitely a keeper!!  One note: adjust your baking time for the size of shrimp you use to avoid over-cooking your shrimp.

So easy and delicious!  I wanted a quick meal so I used  1 lb. thawed full cooked shrimp and 1/2 tsp. garlic salt.  Next time I will double everything as it really is just a two serving meal and my husband wanted more!

Made as directed and found it to be bland. Just not the flavor I was hoping for. Don't know why it was called scampi. Just didn't work for me and my husband.

I made no changes.  I have already made it twice.  I bought shrimp already peeled and deveined, tails attached.  It took  minutes to prepare.  I served it over pasta but it would be equally good over rice or alone.  I will make this over and over.

Very easy, very yummy! Baking them made the shrimp nice and firm. I followed the recipe but added a dash of lemon juice and sprinkle of paprika. Since I had the oven on, I made garlic toast to not waste the sauce. Will make again!

A wonderful meal served with rice or tossed with a small serving of spaghetti.  Have also sprinkled a small amount of panko or Italian bread crumbs over the top for crunch, and served them with a slice of lemon on the side.

Worked well for me on top of plain white rice!  I wanted immediate results, so I cut a couple corners by using a skillet on my gas range and.....garlic powder! (Wahhhh!!! I hope I stepped on all the garlic nuts' toes with that one! Frankly, I won't handle cloves without gloves because I refuse to have that stink in my skin for the next day or so.)  I did find it quite salty, but admittedly used salted butter and didn't take particular care in measuring the k-salt.  Next time, I hope to have more time and do as directed, but this was a winner for my family !

Awesome! I am doing a Whole30, so I substituted ghee for the butter. The shrimp I used was cooked, tail-off, deveined and peeled already so after thawing it, I tossed it in the mixture. I also added paprika, Old Bay seasoning, and lemon juice. I let it marinate for about 20 minutes and then heated the mixture in a saute pan. Once I saw tendrils of steam and the liquid slightly bubbling, I turned off the heat. As all the reviews say- simple and delicious!
