I gave this 4 stars because it was a fantastic idea and made a wonderful base for me to change.  With the tweaking, my husband and I give it 5 stars.  Here is what I changed:  1 cup of rice, white onion instead of red, 10 oz can whole baby clams undrained, 1 cup corn, 1 15oz can tomato sauce, 1 cup milk instead of cream.  In addition I also used a half can of diced tomatoes and some crushed red pepper.  I also didn't simmer as long.  I think clams get rubbery if cooked a long time so I didn't chance it.  I just served it when the corn was done which was after about 10 min.  Everything else in the recipe I kept the same.
Delicious!

This recipe is delicious!  I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit, and I think in the future I'll use less cream to cut back the fat content.  But otherwise, it was a real hit!

This was my first attempt at soup and it turned out fantastic.  As suggested by other reviewers I added red pepper flakes, used the clam water from the canned clams instead of water (you don't need to salt the soup if you go this way) and only used a fraction of the cream.  Awesome recipe!

This soup really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting it to be as scrumptious as it was.

I modified the recipe a bit.  Instead of using 1/2 cup of corn, I used a can of corn, water and all.  Because of the water in the corn, and the juice from the can of clams, I didn't add the cup of water to the soup before letting it simmer, and it came out perfectly.

I also added some hot red pepper flakes for a little heat, and thought the sweetness of the corn and the spicy pepper complimented each other well.

This one's so good and so easy to make. I can't recommend it enough.

I don't really understand why people liked this recipe. I didn't care for it and I did everything the recipe said. Very disappointed!

This is incredibly popular in my house.  I made a batch (again) last night and most of it is gone - and there are just 3 of us.  Changes I make: 2 instead of one can of clams; 1 15-oz can of diced tomatoes in place of 2 of the cans of tomato sauce; and either I add a bit of crushed red pepper, or one of the cans of tomato sauce I do use is Goya picante (hot) flavored tomato sauce (because practically anything with tomatoes is better with a little pepper, even if it's so little you can't put your finger on what's there).  Oh, and I use a 12-oz can condensed milk instead of cream and dried instead of fresh basil (because they're always in my pantry, like all the other ingredients of this soup).

The tomato sauce was a bit overpowering so I would next time, use  2 or 3 cans, 2 cups of milk(I used milk instead of cream) instead of one( we all ended up adding milk to all of our bowls to eat this soup because the tomato sauce was so strong!), add some chopped tomatoes instead, definitely go with a whole cup each of corn and red onion, and honestly I was disappointed becasue the clams didn't make an impact at all. If you do want the soup to be more about the clams, add at least one or two more cans. But what I'm going to do is save my money and not buy the clams next time and just enjoy a creamy tomato soup. Oh, and the butter--totally useless. Usually, in most recipes, I tend to reduce the butter and I thought about doing that for this recipe and bringing it down to one TB but I was afraid I would sacrifice flavor, so I went ahead and used it. However, since I couldn't taste any hint of it through the overwhelming taste of tomato sauce, I'm sure even sauteeing the onions in a little EVOO would have done the trick. Overall, good recipe, just a little too tomato saucey and not much else.

Magnifico,  a thick and hearty soup.   I added 1TBS sugar to cut the acidity.

This is good without the heavy cream as well if you want to reduce calories & fat.  I added only the clam juice at first, and added the clam pieces later to make sure the clams didn't turn tough from overcooking.

Not impressed at all!  Basically was a regular tomato soup but "beefed up".  Still tasted ok, bust was disappointed.  Even used suggestions of less tomato sauce, crushed red pepper etc.

I followed this recipe as directed but added a little bit more clams.  It was easy to make and tasted fantastic.

I was a little nervous about clams and rice together.  I should have listened to that sense.  I often try to upgrade a ho-hum recipe on my next try, but I don't think I'll come back to this one in any way.

After reading the reviews, I tweaked the recipe to my own thoughts.  I doubled the amount of clams and also subbed the one cup of water at the end with an 8 oz. bottle of clam juice.  I had no problem with the acidity of the tomato sauce. Best new soup recipe that I've come across in quite awhile!

This is wonderful soup! I also added 1 can Italian diced tomatoes. I used 2 cans of minced clams (undrained)and I added a little (maybe 1-2 tablespoons) sugar to blend out the flavors. My husband loved it!

Added a bit of red pepper flakes, one tablespoon sugar. Substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream and added 1/4 to 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese. Next time I will use less tomato sauce and add chopped, plum tomatoes from a can. I thought the clams were a bit lost, so may use some bottled clam juice next time or double the amount of clams called for. All-in-all, I enjoyed this and will enjoy tinkering with it a bit more. Thanks.

I just finished making this soup and it is excellent. I adjusted the recipe a bit, because I didn't have any corn. Instead, I used a rice mix that had lentils in it. Turned out to be a great substitution!

Tasty, fast, easy recipe.  I needed to go grocery shopping and was down to practically bare cupboards when I found this easy recipe.  Luckily I had most of the ingredients it called for (sans the onion so I sub'ed minced onion).  I served this with biscuits; it was a hit. A few notes: I would probably add a bit more rice next time.  Also, I ended up adding 1 cup of corn rather than the 1/2 cup it called for (I like a hearty soup).  Lastly, even though I have been cooking for years, I made a novice error: I over-salted.  I didn't realize that the tomato sauce would already have salt added so I added my usual amount of salt to the recipe.  Needless to say, it would have been better with less salt (I added extra water to compensate).  Will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful, tasty soup!! My entire family ate this eagerly, even my 4 children who have rarely eaten clams.  Very hearty and satisfying- a delicious tomato soup. Will make again.
