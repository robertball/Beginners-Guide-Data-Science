I used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix in this recipe, other than that I kept to the recipe. For me, this was a little too runny. Like REALLY runny. And the lime juice overpowered the rest of the flavors. This is more salad dressing than dip for us. I'd make this again but I would cut back on the buttermilk and lime juice and increase the mayonnaise. That aside, the flavor was dynamite.

I rated 4 stars as made some changes based on the first & only reviewer comments.  I used all ingredients just different ratios. I used 3/4 cup buttermilk, MILD chopped green chiles, 3/4 cup mayo, 1/2 of a large jalapeño (plenty spicy for our palate) and 1/2 of juiced lime.  All other ingredients per recipe.  The texture was fine for me as a dip however if one would like it a little more thick using full fat mayo may help that.  Excellent flavor and will definitely make again.  Surprised more have not tried this dip.  Definitely missing out on a very different, delicious dip.

Great buttermilk dip recipe! I only used one jalapeño for my guests’ sake but would use 1-1/2 to 2 for myself. Nice viscosity allows for a range of chips from ruffled to thin original potato chips.
