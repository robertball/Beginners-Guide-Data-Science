This is a very good and  very easy omelette to make. The only change I made was to use cheddar cheese instead but this would be delicious with pretty much any kind of cheese.

I like butter but this was just too much. I used black pepper instead of white and that is the only change I made. Hubs loved this cheese with egg. What I think would make this even better is to add some sliced mushrooms and baby spinach. Good recipe but I recommend cutting the butter in half. As written this was very oily.
