I'm glad lots of you love this recipe - I do, too! I *always* use less oil, and lots more lime juice for extra flavor. Sorry about the confusing way the pasta quantity was posted - use only 8oz of pasta for the recipe! The flavors really are better if you can make it a day ahead, but I usually end up adding a little more salt the next day... somehow it disappears overnight. Use ditalini pasta if you can find it - lots of surface area to soak up the dressing, and very pretty! I think it's hearty enough to eat as a main dish, or you could add some grilled, cooled chicken. Top off the meal with a slice of cold Margarita Pie, and your tummy will be VERY happy!

My entire family loves this recipe!!!!  I made a few changes.  I put 1 1/2 T Chili Powder, 1 t cumin, 1 t chipotle chili powder, 1/4 t cayenne, 1 t dried cilantro, 1 t salt, 4 garlic cloves, 1 can diced green chilies, 1/2 c red onion, and 3 shredded chicken breasts to make it a main dish.  I also reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and increaded the lime juice to 1/2 cup.  YUMMY!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is EXCELLENT!  For those who have commented that the salad is "too dry," please be sure that you are following the recipe correctly.  A typical box of rotini is about 1 pound...enough to double the recipe.  If you use a whole box, then you should double the sauce too!  I will be taking this pasta salad to a cookout tonight and I know it will be a big hit!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I added a chopped, sweet onion, subbed a can of (drained) petite diced tomatoes for the fresh romas, and added a few chopped green onions and trippled the amount of cumin. It was great

Liked this; added a teaspoon of sugar because this helps intensify the flavors; also helped bring out the natural sweetness of the corn, black beans, tomatoes. Went well with burgers. Very pretty presentation and will make again.

I made some modifications to this recipe.  I added a block of diced spicy pepper jack cheese and 3 green onions.  I did not put tomatoes in at all.  And I substituted the fresh red and green peppers for a 12oz jar of roasted red pepper.  Super Yummy!  I think I'll add more crushed garlic next time.

This was fantastic as is!!!! I was worried about the amount of chili, but it was fine. Fresh cilantro and fesh tomatoes are a must. I made this recipe with canned tomatoes and dried parsley because thats all I had and it was very good. The next time I used fresh and it was so much better. To make this a main dish I served it in corn tortilla "bowls" on a bed of shredded lettuce, topped with grated cheddar cheese and a dollop of fat free sour cream.

I think the red chili powder quantity should read 2 TEASPOONS and not TABLESPOONS.  Otherwise, the salad was great.

This is a GREAT recipe.  It is DELICIOUS!  Many of my vegetarians want the recipe.  It is different, has a little "kick" to it, but not too spicy.  I am definitely going to bring this to many cookouts this summer.

We had everything except for green bell pepper and lime juice. We wondered what we could try instead and we found a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette in our fridge. The sweetness of the vinaigrette combined with the spice of the chili powder is so good! The recipe in general is good, but tweaking it up a bit here and there is so fun!

I really wanted to like this, it has all the flavors I love, but sadly, I wasn't a huge fan and most of it got thrown out. Thanks for the recipe anyway!

I really WANTED to like this pasta salad but I it was a little "dry" and I wasn't sure what to add to make it more moist? I only used 1 TBLS chili powder, which was good for us, but followed the remaining ingrediants exactly...hmmmm. Taste was good but like I said, a dry pasta salad isn't too appealing to me, even when covered in spices. Thanks just the same!!

I have to say over all the recipe is good.  I was wanting to try something new for a pot luck for work and had to make a double batch.  I ended up making a few adjustments that made me enjoy it even more.  I followed all the directions but then also added 1 onion chopped up fine.  I also mixed in after it was chilled 8oz of ranch dressing to give it more of a creamy flavor.  I also topped it with shredded Mexican cheese. I think that it tastes better the longer it chills.

To put it in the words from Hubs, this "isn't bad," but that's because I  used less than a third of the chili powder called for.  One look at the ingredients list told me this was a necessary call.  I can't imagine how unpleasant this would have been with three times more than what I used! But I should have cut way back on the cumin too.  Nice assortment of ingredients in the salad itself as well as in the dressing, but the dressing needs work.

A tip for making it less dry - when pasta is cooling it just sucks up liquid.  I let it cool in a bit of the cooking water so it sucks up the water instead of the oil. Once it's not absorbing anymore water, I then add the oil and other ingredients.  It really makes a difference, you can even reduce the oil a bit and still have it taste great.

Love this recipe! I have a few friends that are vegetarians so this recipe was perfect. I doubled it and added a little chipotle hot sauce for a kick. It was a big hit!

I made the recipoe and followed every direction exactly! I too thought it was a little dry so I added a little more lime juice just before serving!  I would also try to add some spicy cheese or something, but I did think it was fabulous!!

Wonderful pasta salad, nice having the southwestern flair. I didn't add corn, not a big fan unless fresh and not the season for fresh. I changed the dressing a bit..I used equal amounts about 1/4 cup of olive oil, lime and added some white wine vinegar. Only a teaspoon of the chili powder, and some coriander spice and black pepper, a few shakes, kept the cumin and garlic as stated. I didn't see the half of box of noodles and used the whole box, but it was fine since I added black olives and avocado, and red onion to the salad. This is one you can play with the vegetables you add easily and not mess up the recipe. Thanks Lisa, a great pasta salad.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe mostly, but didn't have red pepper so used twice as much green, and also added some green onions.  Not sure how much lime juice I used because I just squeezed the juice of the 3/4 lime I had directly into the bowl.  Didn't use any oil at all because I mixed everything else together and it seemed fine without it, so I'm not sure why some people have thought it was dry.  Anyway, very tasty, made it as a main dish because my hubby is a vegetarian and we enjoyed it!  Although I wish I had seen the reviews that said they added cheese, that would have been a good addition!

Wonderful!  It was unusually hot here today, so I made this and served with grilled talapia.  I did add chipotle chili powder (1 tsp) and more lime juice.  I used the canned mexican corn since I cannot get my 10 y.o. son to eat bell peppers..pretty sneaky huh?! I did add cubed Monterey Jack Salsa cheese. I can't tell you if it is good the next day since all of it is gone!  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!

I went completely by the recipe this time, just to know what it was. And wow!! Def a taste of the SW! Fully diggin on it! Even my daughter, the spice wuss, enjoyed it! That's a rave review in itself! Now, after reading what some of you other chefs have done, I'm anxious to try all those things, too. Ya, it'll be awhile of BBQ's before this one gets old! Way to go! You nailed a great pasta salad!!

Pretty good!  Definitely let it marinade a little before eating.  I am lazy and didn't feel like chopping garlic, so I tossed all of the dressing ingredients in the food processor along with hot sauce, oregano, and more cumin and voila! I might try this on a salad! I did find it a little tart, so I added a pinch of splenda.  And as I was tossing the salad, I found it needed more salt.  But that of course is all personal preference.  I used a couple roma tomatoes, but next time (and there will be a next time!) I think I will use grape or cherry tomatoes.

This is a great recipe-a nice change to normal pasta salads-yum!  I made this last night with dinner and it went over very well.  The leftovers today were just as tasty.  I added some cheese-we love cheese in our salads.  Also, I ended up adding some Italian dressing prior to serving-the pasta soaked up so much of the oil/lime juice mixture so it was a bit dry.  Next time I plan on doubling the dressing amount recommended.  All in all, this was a great new recipe to try and I plan on making it for the upcoming holiday weekend.  Thanks for sharing a hit!

I liked this more each day it sat in the fridge.  Originally made for quick lunches, but added diced chicken and served up for dinner the last night and it was a hit.

Absolutely a beautiful looking and tasty cold pasta salad.  I added diced chicken to make it a little more heartier.  It is certainly a croud pleaser.  Thank you Lisa for sharing!

Update - I used Gebhardts chili powder, a little spendy but so worth it!

This is a great recipe!  I really like the southwestern take on the salad as opposed to traditional italian.  I added some red wine vinegar...other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I also used fresh sweet corn grilled, and then cut off the cob.  5 stars!

This was a great, adaptable dish to cook! We did not chill it; ate it warm for dinner and then ate the leftovers chilled later like a "salad". I'm pretty sure I followed other reviews and used a little less oil, added some onion and I used chicken in mine for some meat substance. I would totally make this for a potluck, it makes so much food!

Very good recipe. I used canned beans,canned chipotle corn, and canned diced green chiles, canned diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and onions.Added 4 cloves pressed garlic. Used Chipotle powder with a good amount of ground cumin.Did not have Cilantro at the time so I used a handful of chopped Parsley.Very tasty.Served it with Charcoal Grilled Chicken Thighs in a BBQ marinade. Will make it again!

I ended up using a lot  more lime juice to add some zing to it along with lots of lime zest.  It was much lighter than normal pasta salads and the family enjoyed it.

I use Itialian dressing already made and then add the 1 tablespoon of Chili powder and 2 tablespoon of Cumin. Chill dressing while cutting the veggies. Put water on to boil for Rotini pasta. 1 cook as directed. 1 Red, 1 Green, 1 yellow bell pepper or any combo you like either diced or in slivers ,1 diced or slivers of Red Onion, 1 bunch Cilantro, Corn, diced 1 can green Chilies, 1 can diced Jalapeno peppers. Put all veggies in large biwl, drain pasta poor into bowl of veggies then pour the dressing over the pasta and mix. Chill in refrigerator until either cold about 2 hours or serve the next day. You could always add other veggies, beans and meat to your liking. Its is slightly spicy. This is a good basic recepie to experiment with. Family and friends love this pasta.

I've made this before it is a crowd pleaser.I also like to roast vegetables and I use fire roasted can tomatoes. One of these days when I make this recipe I will add some diced grilled chicken. Very satisfying recipe could be a meal.

I think this would be better with some other sauce. I made this excactly as written.  Tip make your sauce and taste it, if you do not like it then do not ruin it by adding it, find something else that you like and add that instead.

This was a disappointment. I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was OK, but it was definitely missing something... cheese, I think, but I can't completely put my finger on it. If I were to make it again, I might try putting in some pepperjack cheese, as someone else suggested, but I'm not really sure I'm going to try this again.

REALLY GOOD! I didn't have any Chili Powder (thought I did) so I had to use Mrs Dash "Caribbean Lime".... the main ingredient was Chili Powder. It ended up being to acidic so I added a fresh jalapeno pepper (with seeds). It balanced out the acidity perfectly!  And I'll make it again. I garnished mine with three thin slices of lime wedges! Props to the creators!

When reading about the ingredients it sounded delicious!  Sadly, it was not... I could only use the word 'unique' when telling my husband about it.  The salt is a MUST as it helps brings all the unique flavors together.

This is the BEST pasta salad ever! I have made it twice now. The first time, I mixed in some freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I left it out the second time, only because it was being served to someone who is lactose intolerant. It was absolutely delicious either way! The cilantro and the lime add such freshness and lightness...don't skimp on the lime juice! One more thing...Use any fresh (not canned)tomatoes you have on hand. It doesn't matter, it will come out delicious! This is a recipe I will use for life! :)

This was the perfect solution for being bored with the typical "Italian" pasta salad! It's light, tasty, & super easy. The cilantro adds a wonderful flavor & the lime based dressing is refreshing. The next time I make it, I will add a small can of green chilies just for little kick. This was a big hit at a Memorial Day picnic...thanks!!!

This pasta salad is different and delicious!  I made the salad pretty much as written.  However I did use Chipotle Chili Powder instead of regular Chilil Powder and I scaled back the amount to 1 teaspoon since I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids.  Will probably add a bit more next time.  Added in a little extra cumin and garlic also.  Served it up with some grilled Mahi Mahi.  Next time I will add in a bit more lime juice than called for and will also throw in some black olives.  This pasta salad is easy to make and a deliciously different change from the usual pasta salad.

I have made this two or three times and it never lasts long.  I do think that adding more lime juice, and a few dashes of red pepper, makes this dish more flavorful. I also included the juice of one orange, which added a nice sweetness to the dish that complimented the corn and black beans, and offset the bitterness of the chili power.  If you like Mexican flavors, you will be sure to like this dish!

We really enjoyed this. I upped the lime juice and cut the oil a little. I also threw in some grilled chicken and made a meal out of it. Maybe next time we'll add some taco meat instead. Also needed some extra salt for our taste.

The combination of black beans, corn and cilantro always goes over well in my family, so we enjoyed this recipe. I made it as written and served it with grilled chicken. It was a nice light and easy dinner. My family has asked me to make this again so it will be put in my regular rotation.

Remember to mix the spices in the oil before mixing in with the pasta. It does make a difference...as I found out!! Very good, even with less oil. Leftovers evaporate.

On the day I made this recipe, the spices were overwhelming, however, after sitting overnight they definitely mixed well and were toned down. It is unlikely I will make this again.

If you like this kind of salad, try the Mexican Bean Salad, has a bit more zip to it.  I have made it several times and always goes over very well.

I agree that the two TABLESPOONS of Chili powder is a little overpowering, but this is one of those recipes that gets better the longer it sits.  I recommend making it a day ahead and letting it sit in the fridge overnight.  I substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro, since it tends to taste soapy to me, but it was still delicious!

This is a great pasta salad recipe.  The only things I changed were to add a little more lime juice and some chopped scallions.  I took it to a cookout and everyone loved it.  I have also made it and served sliced avocado and grilled chicken on top for a complete meal with an extra squeeze of lime.  So good!

Wow! This was great! I made the pasta from scratch, i left out the cilantro and used less chili powder and olive oil instead of regular oil! This was unbelievable! Pop some dark red kidney beans in and this can be a hearty meal for a vegetarian! WHOOP WHOOP! :)

Delicious and refreshing. I added 2 splenda packets to bring out the flavor of the corn & beans. Also only used 1/2 cup oil and that was plenty.

I needed something vegetarian to take to a potluck being held to introduce some consultants from India who would be working with us for an extended period but I wanted it to also be very regional and, since so much Indian food is quite spicy, I didn't want it too bland nor incendiary.  This was a huge hit.  I can't give it a "5" because I just don't know enough about vegetarian food.  I doubled the recipe.  For the dressing I made half again as much as I needed but only put the spices appropriate to the "doubled" dressing.  I tried that on some of the pasta and ran it by my husband.  He approved.  I dressed the salad with only the doubled amount and reserved the rest in case the pasta soaked up too much dressing and left it dry.  I didn't need the rest.  I thought the dressing just a bit oily but not enough to merit tinkering with it.  PS.  I had left over salad because I had made so much.  I added chopped cooked chicken and a little of the left-over dressing and it was great!

Great recipe! I made this for my baby shower and it was a big hit. Only change I made was to add more cumin, chili powder and lime juice -- it seemed to need more spice, as well as a lot more salt. Once I added more "stuff", it tasted wonderful.

Also, to the person who mentioned using red chili powder: red chili powder is powdered dried chilis, while chili powder is a blend of spices used to make chili! That's probably why it came out so spicy!

great pasta salad, a friend's husband said it was now his favorite pasta salad ever! I halved the recipe which was still 8 servings but still used the whole bag of pasta and I thought the mix was just right. I also used the canned petite diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and it was perfect, with all the other flavors the tomatoes tasted fresh!! Great recipe and great BBQ or picnic side dish because no mayo to go bad!!! Loved it!

Love it!!! I used lemon instead of lime & canned tomatoes with green chilis. Also~ my local WinCo carries an awesome Southwest frozen veggie blend with corn, black beans, peppers & onions. Saves gobs of time to use that instead of chopping fresh! I prefer this hot, not as a chilled pasta salad. Thanks for this yummy, yummy recipe!

Made this for a graduation party and it turned out wonderful! I grilled fresh corn on the barbeque and switched the veggie oil for olive oil, both of which really helped the salad pop. I'm actually making again for a family gathering coming up soon.

This is delicious--great blend of flavors.  For those of you who like a lot of oil/vinaigrette in a pasta salad, you probably won't like this recipe.  There is virtually no oil/dressing laying in the bottom of the bowl.  The flavors are GREAT.  I made it the night before the refrigerated ate, tasting it a few times along the way for salt.  I bought fresh bi-color corn, cooked it, and sliced it off the cob.  And I used organic heirloom tomatoes.  And I doubled the recipe since I took it to a picnic.  Will make again!

I ended up added onions and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese but I though the salad came out very dry and on the bland side - too much of a lime taste if i added more juice, not enough of the spice.  I followed other suggestions and added extra chili powder but it didn't help. What we ended up doing to force down the left overs was add some salsa - then it tasted alright. Probably won't be making this again.

I am not a huge pasta salad fan.  I like this significantly better than mayonaisse based recipes.  This is always a hit at pot lucks, so it's just my taster that isn't in love with it. :-)

Awesome base with others suggestions added like cutting back olive oil to 2-3 Tbsp., added diced red onion, avocado, jicama for texture, and I halved the chili powder and added an equal amount of chipolte powder for a a little more heat with a smokey addition that was nice for our taste.  Thanks so much for sharing.  This dish was perfect for our guests who many are vegetarian but I had shredded chicken on the side for our meat lover guests and all were very pleased with this dish.

This is the spiciest pasta salad I've ever made. Over the four to five days it took us to eat all of it the flavors just got better. This is for people who like spicy! We do and I'll definitely make this again soon.

Very good! I had to make something for a potluck and I was tired of the boring Italian pasta salad. I was drawn to this one because of all the colors! I doubled the recipe, added a few jalapeños to give it a bit more kick and everyone loved it!

I was very excited to make this pasta salad, and although it turned out tasting good it was too dry. I even added twice the amount of sauce and it was still too try. Before serving it I added about 1/3 cup of chicken stock and I added 1 cup of chopped red onions. My boyfriend ate it and he thought it was ok but he said it could be better. I agreed. I wondered what it would taste like heated so I stuck it in the microwave for 3 minutes and I was incredibly surprised at how much better it tasted! I sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top and that was it! From now on, I'll eat the rest of the leftovers heated.

My family loved this dish!  I made it into a entree by adding seitan (we are vegetarian).  I also added a little besamic vinegar and sauted our bell peppers with the seitan and a little more spice.  Next time I might add cube cheese and onion.  Over all this recipe is very yummy and easy to make your own.

Wasn't that impressed with this dish.  To be fair, I was looking for a light, summery pasta dish with some flavor.  Flavor this had though :)  I even kicked it up a bunch with some chipotle seasoning.  Used seashell pasta and a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomato.  It's a good side for a mexican dish if you want a change to rice.

Was looking for a new pasta salad, this was great! Only sub I made was olive oil for veg oil (used a little chili infused oil as well) and skipped the cilantro b/c my husband hates it.  I bet it would be even better w/ the cilantro!!  I will make this over and over.....could also serve this with diced avocado and shredded cheese on top!!

YUM! I used pinto beans because I didn't have any black beans and I added chicken.  I also added some extra lime juice the next morning for a little extra zing.  We ate this as meal while camping.  Very portable and no cooking for lunch.  I'll be using this pasta salad a lot!

Very delicious! I loved it so much I've turned into one of our regular meals by adding some fajita chicken to it.

I liked it.  Used a bag of frozen southwestern corn/black bean/pepper mix from the store and it worked great and took some of the prep work out of it.

I'm not a pasta salad person so when asked to bring one to a family dinner I came right to allrecipes for one. I tried this one and wow...it is great! Tastes the best if allowed to set for a day before serving...so I will make a day ahead from now on and extra lime juice is GOOD. Also I keep the tomatoes seperate till serving. The second day with the left overs (not much) I added fresh diced japaleno(seeds and pith removed) and diced pepperjack cheese and was wonderful! I can't thank you enough for this recipe...I now keep all the ingredients on hand...and was called the next day and asked for the recipe.

I used 16oz. rotini, 1/4c. oil, juice from one lime, 3tbsp. chili powder, 3tsp. cumin, 1tsp. salt(and salted noodles while cooking), 1tsp. minced garlic, one can chick peas, 1 can diced tomatoes, and about 1 1/2c. cilantro all because this is what I had on hand and a corn allergy.  I think it tastes wonderful and I can't wait to have it tomorrow after everything marinates!

Ummm...Ummm...Ummm!
This recipe is so good!
I added grilled chicken, making this a complete dinner!  Made margaritas.
Packed everything and went on a picnic!
Will definitely make again!
P.S.  I'd give it 10 stars!!!

Made this for our Memorial day BBQ and everyone liked it. I started out making it close to the recipe, but found it pretty bland. I changed it by using more lime juice, olive oil-just eyeballed it, a little reserved starchy pasta water, parsley instead of cilantro since I don't like it, green onion, and less cumin since one of my friends doesn't like it. I let it sit for a couple of hours and it was still a little bland and the chili powder was a little overpowering. I added more lime juice, touch more olive oil, quite a bit more salt, black pepper, hot sauce, and a sprinkle of taco seasoning since I had a packet open. It was better but still a little blander than I would prefer - but I left it that way since my friends can't all do spicy. To make it just for us in the future I'll add minced jalapeno, some cubed pepper jack cheese, more hot sauce, use less chili powder (might try a little chipotle chili powder), and cayenne pepper. It just seemed to be missing something...maybe for me it was spicy heat.

I loved this recipe because it was different.  I brought it to a picnic and it was all gone. A lot of the regular pasta salads weren't. It seemed a bit bland when I made it but I played around with the spices and added more cumin and lime juice.  I think it was a hit and would make it again.

Wow! I love this pasta salad! Such a change from the traditional salads that are often passed over at picnics. I few additions that I made included adding more corn and a can of pinto beans on top of the black beans, and adding cheddar cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper. DIVINE!

I liked this recipe but not everyone at the table agreed.  Everyone ate it except one guy who said it tasted like salsa mixed with pasta.  Overall I think the salad needed more zip.  I cut down on the chili powder because others said it was to spicy. I found the whole dish just a tad blah.  I would put some Tabasco and sugar in the dressing next time.  It was good but no one raved about it.

LOVE this salad.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a potluck.  There was none leftover!  Everyone loved the flavor, even the guys!  Some had 4 servings!!  It was different yet very flavorful.  I used bow tie pasta and it dressed the salad up!  I will be making this again a lot this summer!!

I had high hopes for this one but was a bit disappointed.  The dressing just isn't very good as written.  I think maybe the addition of vinegar to the oil and spices might help.  I reduced the chili powder to 1 Tbsp. which was plenty.  I added sliced olives which I thought was a nice addition.  The ingredients were healthy and beautiful in presentation but the dressing is lacking.

The chili powder was a bit overpowering for me.  I do want to try making it again though, I'll just reduce the chili powder.  Lime juice is a nice touch.

I made this for a family reunion and it was well-received.  Different from the typical pasta salad.  I added green onions and cubed pepper jack cheese.  I thought it was delicious and plan to make it again.

What a wonderful summertime light and flavorful pasta salad!  I thought this recipe was perfect...my only changes were that I only used 1 tablespoon of chili powder and I added some cubed Monterey Jack pepper cheese and mini penne pasta.  Thanks for the recipe, it was fabulous!!!

I have made this dish for several years, minus the chicken and pasta. I always just make it as a vegetarian salad. Makes a great summer salad and unusual picnic/party dish. My family loves the flavors and can't get enough. It's even better the next day after it's marinated a little.

We enjoyed this as written. I did add a big scoop of salsa. 
Thank you for sharing. We will make again.  Update... Next time I'll make a smaller batch because I didn't care for it so much the next day.  I will add a bit more salsa to finish this batch off

Excellent salad.  There is just the right amount of dressing, and it is not oily.  I would skip the salt next time (depends on the chili powder you use I think) and could use more bell peppers if desired.  I added a dash of cayenne and half packet of sweet n' low just to cut some of the salty taste and tone down the sour of the lime.

Very tasty!  I didn't have cilantro on hand so I had to do without, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I think it tastes really good the first day, but the second day...WOW.  So yummy.  This is great for those times when you want something other than the normal Italian style pasta salads.  Thanks!

GREAT recipe!  What a great home made recipe for pasta salad (without using a boxed mix).  I'm serving it along side grilled chicken - perfect for a hot summer day.  It's in the fridge right now but I think I'll add a diced avocado to it.  It'd even be great with a handful of shredded cheddar thrown in!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for a potluck BBQ tonight.  I think that it would be a better side dish for a mexican dinner, rather than a traditional BBQ.  But it was well received and eaten.  I think that the flavors worked well together and will definitely make again.

I tried to like this, even tried it the next day expecting to have my mind changed. It really was too dry for my liking and I was sure to only use half of the pasta box.

Really good! This was a nice change from my usual Italian-style pasta salads. Great, bold flavors. I did only use half the chili powder and that worked well for our tastes. Thanks! :)

I made some changes but this is a great pasta salad, really good flavor.  Used 1 can black beans, 1 can whole kernel corn, dried cilantro instead of fresh, 1 can stewed Mexican style tomatoes (drained), 1/4 cup oil.  I will definitely make this again I'm sure it will be even better with fresh ingredients.

I took this to a picnic worried it wouldn't suit many peoples taste buds, but was pleasantly surprised by the reaction!  Everyone loved it and asked what was in it.  Black beans are hard to find in Australia and no one at the BBQ knew what they were and wanted to know all about the recipe.  I ended up using a packet of taco seasoning mix as that was what was in my pantry and it worked great.  Making another batch as we speak and will continue to make it for potlucks!

This is one of the yummiest pasta salads I have ever eaten! The lime juice, fresh garlic, cilantro, and chili powder combine to make a zesty and tasty sauce. The addition of black beans and veges make it really healthy, too. There is freedom here to add any number of different vegetables to really pack it full vitamins. I used Radiatore pasta (it's like 3 ruffled layers) and that shaped really held the sauce in. Follow the instructions about how much pasta to use. The suggestion ofadding grilled chicken is great. With or without, it can be a meal in itself. It's only been 5 days since I made it and I am making more now as I write this. Hats off to the Chef!!

This was a great recipe! I'm always looking for no-mayo pasta salad recipes since I'm not a fan of a lot of mayo. In addition to black beans I used chick peas to punch up the protein and flavor. I like spicy so I used quite a bit of chili powder. And from a diff pasta salad recipe I've used I knew and reviews I read that said this could tend to be dry I used low-fat Italian dressing for flavor and to help mix everything well. Can't wait to make this again!

Took this and 4 other salads to my niece's briadal shower and this was the big No Seller. Not sure why, but no one seemed to like this salad. I thought the taste was okay, but I will admit as we were cleaning up it was the one bowl I tossed rather than saved to bring home. I stink at modifying recipes, but am thinking possibly a smarter cook would know how to tweak the dressing which was heavy on seasoning, but low on flavor - meaning I could taste all of the seasonings and spices in there, just don't know that they tasted good in there!

This is excellent.  A little diced purple onion and a can of sliced black olives are wonderful additions - maybe some cheese, too.

Eay to make and it looks pretty. I added far less chili powder than the recipe called for and we still found it pretty spicy. In fact my daughters found it too spicy for them.

I made this today for a potluck. It was a hit! Zesty and refreshing! As others have mentioned, do remember to put the spices into the oil before mixing...and take care to adjust the measurements for the amount of pasta you are using.

I added chopped red onion because I thought it was a little bland.  Also, added chicken (southwestern style Perdue short cuts) because to my husband, it wouldn't be a main course without meat. It was delicious! Absolutely loved it with or without the chicken (but definitely needed the red onion). Thank you!

I have made this twice now and I love it! My tips: extra cilantro (if you like it) and throw even more in right before serving. Add the tomatoes before serving so they are more crisp than soggy. Extra lime juice, less oil, and squeeze a lime over it before serving.   I last brought it to a pool party. I was hoping it would get overlooked so I could take it home with me (sneaky,greedy, I know!), but someone opened it toward the end of the night. There were people huddled around the counter eating it directly from the container! I left for home without it :( but the friend throwing the party said that she brought it as a snack for an outdoor event. She and her friend also loved it and were telling me about it two weeks later!

I thought this was quite good and the lime really added to the dish.  Loved the black beans and corn!  My husband, however, hated it.  So I won't make it again, but I'm glad I tried it.  I did dice up my garlic and cilantro and I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup lime juice.

This was pretty good, but a little too much. There was too much oil, too much cumin, too much chili powder. I think next time I make it, if I go with this recipe, I'll cut down on the spices and add more fresh veggies.

This won rave reviews at our 4th of July gathering.  Lots of requests for the recipe.  Definitely better the next day, so plan on making it ahead, if you can.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious.  Top individual servings with some diced avocado.  Delicious!

This had a wonderful flavor and a nice new twist on a cold pasta salad...make a day ahead as the flavors get better with a time. I used 1.5 T chili powder and that was over powering so will scale back on that. Would definately take to a potluck dinner.

Was looking for a different pasta salad for a Father's Day family dinner.  This one was PERFECT!!!  EVERYONE loved it and wanted the recipe.  I didn't have the red and green peppers, but added some green onion and some diced pimento for color.  The chili powder and cumin added a wonderful flavor, and we loved the extra kick from the lime juice.  It did seem a bit dry after it marinated overnight, so I added a little more olive oil and lime juice the next day.  Even my men, who don't like my "girly salads" devoured this.  Thank you, Lisa!

This was a pretty tasty recipe that was very easy to make.  I think it would taste a lot better after chilling in the fridge overnight.

Made this for a family gathering.  Only change made was to double the oil and throw in some black olives.  Was a major hit with the family.  Tastes better if allowed to sit in fridge overnight.

Great pasta salad, something different from the "old faithful". I did half the oil and doubled the lime, added 2 tbs of brown sugar (that added great depth to the flavors) used powdered garlic and I did add some scallions. Really great recipe

This was such a nice change from the typical pasta salad!  I followed other suggestions by adding chicken and avocado.  I also threw in some fresh spinach right before serving.  Yum! Thanks for the recipe...definitely a keeper!

This was excellent. I suggest making it when company is coming. Your house smells so good from the garlic and cilantro! They'll think you can cook!!! Also would be a meal in itself if you made up chicken or beef fajita strips and added them to it. Delicious!

I also made this for memorial day BBQ. I followed recipe exactly except added some black olives and some sharp cheddar cheese. It was delicious! I found the spices to be perfect, and was not to strong even on the second day - didn't last very long! Thanks!

We wanted to try something different for our barbecue, and the steak we made had cumin in the rub, so I thought this would go well - and it sure did go!  I was also a bit confused about the amount of pasta, but I don't usually measure things anyway, so I figured I'd just add more oil if I needed to.  I also didn't rinse the can of beans - I like the sauce, and it added some moisture to the pasta salad too.  We didn't have cilantro, so I can't wait to try it again with it.  My husband ate it ALL - no leftovers at all!

This is a great pasta salad. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to use a whole box of Rotini and we were having it as a main course. I was a little nervous about the large amount of chile powder so I used 3TBLS. instead of 4. and it was still really good. I even think you could add chicken to it to make it a filling main course. I will be making this again!

My family (even 1 yr.old) loved this recipe. Like others, I did reduce the chili powder to 1 Tablespoon. If too dry, add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of Italian dressing & it moistens right up! Yummy.

I made this recipe for out of town guests. I feel like it was supposed to have a kick to it or just more flavor. I was a little disappointed. I think next time i may try a taco seasoning pkg. I really liked the black beans and other vegies that were in the recipe. The seasoning is the only thing i would change.

Like another reviewer I thought this salad was a little dry but very good tasting. I made it for a pot luck at church. I did have to add more salt later and when I got home from the pot luck I threw about a half cup of salsa in the remaining salad. It made a noticeable improvement to the dryness of the salad without taking away from the healthiness. I had also used a high fiber pasta and maybe it soaked up more of the moisture? Anyway I had some yesterday for lunch and this time I threw in a handful of shredded cheddar to the mix. YUMMY! Overall a great recipe. Next time I make it, I'll use lime flavored olive oil in the dressing in place of canola oil.

The recipe was great! I double it and used the dish for Teacher Luncheon at my son's school. The teachers loved it! I didn't have enough black beans for the doubled recipe so I added a can of lack olives. It turned out to be a nice touch. I think next time I will add a little sugar to intensify the flavors like someone else suggested. Thanks!

This is a fantastic pasta salad!  Only changes I made were adding 1/2 cup + of freshly squeezed lime juice (juice of 2 limes) and decreased the chili powder to 4 teaspoons as I was afraid it would be too spicy but it wasn't.  Prepared the day ahead so flavors could marinate - delicious!

I made it with double the sauce and the night before to take to a picnic.  It was one of the only salads that was gone at the end.  I made it again with wheat pasta and it was not as good.  With this recipe I'll stick to regular pasta!

This pasta salad was great! I made it for a BBQ at my house and everyone liked it, especially my husband. I left out the tomatoes, though and used bow tie pasta, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We're going out of town this weekend and I am making this again to bring along.

I don't know what the lady was talking about, about being dry.  This was such an amazing change from normal pasta salads.  The only changes I made where I didn't have peppers so I excluded them, Used can diced chili tomatoes and I didn't have fresh lime juice so I used bottled lime juice.  All this and still wonderful.  Even the kids enjoyed it.

If you are getting tired of mayo based pasta salads, try this recipe! I used black olives instead of black beans, and I regret that I did not have any fresh cilantro on hand (this is a must). I will definitely make this again, and thanks to this recipe will probably make my own taco seasoning from now on.

This recipe is delicious! I really enjoyed it as did my boyfriend. I think it could use some hot sauce and maybe an avocado, too, but it is truely good as is. I just like things to be on the spicer side and I adore avocado, so that's just me! I used whole wheat pasta and it is quite filling. I served a guacamole gaspacho. Great summer meal.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Just used what I had on hand, Including suddenly salad mix instead of oil and dressing and noodles separately. TURNED OUT AMAZING. I loved the cumin flavor in it. I only had canned diced tomatoes but I look forward to trying it with real ones. or cherry tomatoes.

This is a great recipe and so different than the run of the mill pasta salads. I did make a few changes...used less (olive) oil and less chili powder, used more lime juice, more cumin and more garlic. And I made the dressing a day before I wanted to use it so the flavors could blend.  Also I used fresh corn I cut off the cobb and microwaved for a few minutes which added a nice sweet taste. I added a fresh jalapeno pepper and some dried cayene pepper. Also, I used a small shell pasta as that's what I had on hand. Everyone loved it and I'll make it again soon! Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a family potluck. Everyone said they liked it but it's hard to say if they were just being nice.  My husband liked it at first but the chili powder became a bit to much.  I don't know if it was the brand of chili powder I used, but the salad seemed gritty from so much powder.  If I make this again I'll definitely cut down on the chili and maybe add some other spices to liven it up.  I gave it four stars because it is a nice change from the ordinary and very colorful to present.

Just made this and it's fantastic.  I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon.  Can't wait to make it again with the lime.  Took others advice and used only 1/4 cup olive oil and definately extra juice to give it a good bite.  This would also be really good with some avacado added in at the last minute.

I made this recipe for a potluck it's super simple to make and it's nice to have a pasta dish that does not have mayo.  I did make some changes.  I halved the spices only because it was for a potluck.  I also added a ton more lime juice so much so that  I lost count of the amount.  It had great flavor, I recommend serving it with a wedge of lime, so that it gives each person a "pop" of flavor that everyone loved.  There were no leftovers to bring home

This recipe was a life saver!  At 8:30 in the morning I remembered I needed to make a pasta salad for an event at 11am.  I was able to mix up and have in the fridge to cool in no time.  I used uncooked frozen corn and I did put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes to take the heat out of the pasta before putting in the fridge. I did not have plum or canned tomatoes so I added a cup of salsa instead and it was awesome.  I also cut back on the oil and was glad I did- any more would have been too much.

I just made this recipe for the first time with one variation.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It was fantastic!  Olive oil is healthier and doesn't have an oily taste.  Next time I plan to add zuccini and more garlic and cilantro.

I love this recipe.  It's a change from the run of the mill pasta salad with italian dressing and it's so fresh tasting.  I 1st made this for Thanksgiving and was asked to bring it again for Christmas.  The 2nd time I made it I used olive oil instead of vegetable just to be a little healthier and noticed no change in taste.  I also added a 1/2 cup of green onions and a tsp. of sugar as some other reviews had mention.  I also made a double batch of the dressing and cooked chicken in half of it add to the leftover salad.  Delicious!

I loved the flavor of the salad and I don't even like lime! I used cherry tomatoes, added black olives and pepperjack cheese cubes and doubles the recipe. If it wasn't for a bakesale I would add jalapeno per my taste. Thanks for recipe!

Very yummy!  I made it pretty much as is and it was great the next day even.  Everyone seemed to love it.  I am making it again in a few days for a taco bar potluck.

Not so sure about this one.  Hubby liked it but I didn't. I think the chili powder needs to be cut way back.  I doubled the recipe but did not double the chili powder. Added black olives and onions as someone suggested. Even added some vinegar and green chilies but still missing something.  Just don't know quite yet what it is.

Quite good. I doubled the recipe to use a full package of pasta. I preped the wet ingredients while pasta cooked.  Since my pasta was a fairly dense type, I suspected that I would need a fairly "wet" dressing.  I used all the suggested spices and added one can of Rotell that I pureed, also added 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 2 tsp of paprika.  I did not have the full amount of lime, but think the rotell made up for it.  I tossed the pasta and and remaining ingredients (did not add any tomotos) together with 3/4 of the dressing, and added some cubes of pepperjack cheese.  Let sit overnight.  As expected, the pasta absorbed most of the dressing and I tossed in the 1/4 dressing that I reserved to brigten it up a bit.  GREAT! Will make this again and probably add one more Tbsp of chili powder.

This was excellent.  I took it to a potluck and while there were other pasta salads there, this one was eaten most.  I used halved grape tomatoes in place of the chopped plum tomatoes - I think it was more attractive that way.  Oddly enough, the leftovers make good soup, too!  I just added the leftovers to some canned vegetable broth and chopped tomatoes, and seasoned it with more of the same spices that were in the recipe.

The pasta salad looked amazing, but it was missing the “wow” factor in taste.  It was good, but not great.... I’m not sure what was missing.

I cut the amount of cumin in half because it seemed like a lot.  I’d make it again, but cut way back on the cilantro too.  It was too much.

A perfect summer pasta salad!  I did make a few changes/additions which I think made it a 5 star recipe.  First, I took the suggestion of other reviewers by swapping the amounts of the oil & lime and reducing the chili powder to 1 TBSP.   I added 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp garlic powder (in place of the fresh garlic), and 1/8 tsp ground cayenne to the dressing.  I replaced the green bell pepper with a 4 oz can of  diced green chilies and added 1/2 cup diced pepper jack cheese for an extra kick. (I also omitted the tomato but that is just personal preference.)  Then I topped each serving with sliced black olives and diced avocado along with the cilantro.  Scrumptious!

I doubled the ingredients but the lime was WAY too much.  I might try again and just use the amount of lime indicated for the half a box of pasta.  I had added 2 shredded chicken breasts for this as a main dish summer meal so this was really disappointing.  I googled how to correct for too much lime and did add some smokey honey I had, which made this edible, but hubs who rarely complains made a face.  Wasted time and ingredients.

This was so good...but I did make a few minor changes for my tastes.  I substituted Penzey's Fajita seasoning instead of chili powder.  Every brand of chili powder tastes different and so I smell the seasonings to help decide if that is the flavor I want.  My nose told me to go with Fajita seasoning and am glad I did.  I prepared the salad dressing first so the flavors would meld while I prepped the vegies and boiled the pasta.  Also, I didn't have green pepper so used red and yellow bell peppers instead.  Since this was south of the border flavors, I added about 1/2 cup of black olives cut in half.  Also didn't have roma tomatoes and so subbed a cup of drained Ro-Tel tomatoes and that took the salad over the top!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so didn't use that but am sure that would totally add to the overall flavor.  For serving, I thinly sliced lettuce and placed the pasta salad on the lettuce, diced half an avocado and placed 1/2 of it on the pasta followed by a teaspoon dollop of sour cream (kind of like nachos).  That gave it the creaminess some said was missing.   It was divine!!!

Very good - thank you for sharing your recipe. For me, I made a small quantity and added some of a bag of C&W Southwest Blend (frozen beans, corn, Poblano peppers) to the boiling pasta 2 mins. before draining. Worked better for me to do - small family. (The rest of the bag of frozen veg. works well in tortilla soup, scrambled eggs, etc. and keeps well in a tightly closed plastic container in the freezer.)

I liked all the ingredients in this salad, but was a bit underwhelmed by the texture. As some other reviewers stated, it lacked creaminess and the chili powder was too grainy just in oil. I ended up adding about half a cup of mayo to the entire thing and it was delicious. Also added shredded pepper jack.

It  is delicious. I doubled the recipe for a 16 oz. box of pasta. I used one half cup olive oil.  I used grape tomatoes cut in halves. I added sliced olives and chopped onion and some hot sauce. I added extra fresh garlic.  I also used half the recipe amount of chili and cumin.  i did not use cilantro. Thanks so much!

Mostly good, but I followed the recipe quantity for the chili powder and it was way too much.  My noodles ended up looking completely brownish red, which was weird and not appetizing looking.  I should've cut the amount of chili pepper in half.  I subbed cucumber for the red pepper since I didn't have one and still wanted the crunch.  I thought it needed more kick, so I threw in a finely chopped jalapeño.

This turned out fabulous! I stayed right with the recipe and just doubled it because I used a 16 ounce package of pasta and by the reviews the dressing needed to be doubled for that amount. It turned out just right. We had it with a grilled hamburger steak and baked potato. It was a wonderful Sunday afternoon meal. I will be making this again.

Really liked this recipe, but next time would make it advance to give the salad time to chill & flavour through. Also swapped Cajun seasoning for the chili powder (just the right amount of spice for the kids). Added some red onion and doubled the recipe. Will make again for sure.

Very good.  You could some diced smoked chicken breast if you need meat in your meal Kidney beans would make a good substitution or addition.

Followed pretty much the recipe. Eliminated sodium where ever possible    The noodles were not wheat.  It was a combination of grains including quinqoa, spelt , rice and other grains. 
  Every loved the flavor and the comfort food.  My daughter is in heart failure and on a very strict diet.  Everyone loved this recipe

I had to add a lot of spices such as garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and celery salt. If I hadn't added these, the salad wpuld have been extremely bland. If I make this again, I will also quickly sautee the peppers so that this isn't just pasta with crunchy, raw peppers.

I love every ingredient in this dish. We were looking for something a little different for a side dish, the taste was not good. Not sure how it could've gone wrong, we even dialed back the chili powder too.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, except for the chili powder. I only had 1 Tablespoon on hand. I think it needed the 2 Tablespoons though.  It wasn't as good as it looked, but I did try it at room temperature right after I made it.  I think it will taste better the next day after it's chilled and all the flavors blend in.  I put it in a glass bowl and wrapped it with plastic wrap-will try it tomorrow. I think it needs more kick, like maybe red onions, and freshly cracked black pepper, and/or maybe some shaved cheese.  I gave it four stars because it has potential, I just have to tweak it a bit.  Thanks!
 
I rated this last night right after making it, and like I said, it does taste better the next day! The flavors blended in nicely but it still needed some kick. I added freshly cracked black pepper and some coarse sea salt.  It was very good.  I will make it again next time with red onions and some finely minced jalapenos, either green or red jalapenos. It does look very pretty in a glass bowl, very colorful and festive. Thanks for submitting this recipe.!

I thought this was a great dish.  I had no black beans so kidney beans were substituted.  I loved it!  Added some cubed grilled chicken, marinated in some off the shelf Tuscan chicken pesto sauce.  Definitely a repeat recipe.

This was very tasty.  Used 1/2 pkg of Rotoni (8oz) and cut the chili powder and cumin in half.  I substituted the lime juice for lemon juice and added chopped onions, but made the rest of the salad as directed. My partner said it was a keeper, which doesn't happen too often.

I don't tolerate spicyness, but followed the recipe as is. Delicious, not too spicy for spice-wimps. Added onion and radishes. Used the same dressing to marinate chicken breasts, but with a little  apple cider vinegar added. These were also delicious.

I saw this same recipe on Facebook and tried it out.  It was really good with a very fresh taste.  I didn't add as much of the chili powder and none of the lime juice as I have acid reflux and it was still delicious.  I will definitely be making it again.

The only thing I changed was adding one less tbsp of chili powder since I was making it for kids.  Also, added chicken to bulk up the protein.

The original recipe was just ok, a bit bland. So I added red onion, more lime juice, rougly a Tb of sugar, a little cheese, and a bit of rasperberry vinegarette dressing. This really woke the dish up. I'd make it again, with the new additions.

My family and I loved this pasta salad!  I made it as it was written and got lots of compliments.   We'll be having it again soon--anticipating it'll be even better with summer tomatoes!

As a person who does not eat meat, I really enjoyed this recipe.... no mayo! The first time I ate this the person who made it chose dill instead and it still tasted great. I add more chili powder because I enjoy things a little spicy, I also add feta cheese which adds a little more flavor.

This was a good pasta salad, but not outstanding.  I used only 2 Tablespoons of oil, as it seemed moist enough with that and used only green pepper.  It was good & people ate it, but no one raved or asked for the recipe.  I also thought the cilantro was a bit wilty and detracted from how it looked since I had made it the night before.

This is a STAPLE for my family. I get requests for it all the time!! It is so unlike other "classic" pasta salads that it stands out among the crowd! A few things to note that I think it needs:
1/4 C olive oil (instead of 1/3 C veg oil);
1/2 C lime juice;
3 cloves garlic;
1/2 t cayenne pepper;
1 bar pepper jack cheese, cubed;
1 whole green + 1 whole red bell pepper;

This recipe is a great starting point and you can add/subtract anything you'd like!

I altered this to mimic my favorite black bean and corn salad recipe.  I added some green onions, avocado, and cubed cheese (used monterey Jack but would have preferred pepper jack).  Yummy!

Looks pretty, has exciting ingrediants but it tastes very bland! I served it at my son's mexian themed birthday party and it was barely touched.

This is a good recipe, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it needs more spice and less oil.  I used whole wheat pasta and it was a big hit with my guests.  Better on day 2 after it has marinated a bit.

Quite good :) I used parsley instead of cilantro, added some chopped green onion, and some tofu - cubed, dredged in flour, chili powder, cumin, and oregano, and sauteed in a small amount of olive oil. A good meal in and of itself.

I made this to go with some grilled chicken last night for a fall dinner - it was delicious! I added a little more chilli powder because my boyfriend and I like spicy, and I added some green onions because I had some to use up. It was very fresh and summery, and went great with barbequed chicken and raw veggies! Thanks!

This was an awesome salad.  I love fresh black bean salsa and this has a similar taste.  I agree with reviewers that suggested increasing the lime juice. I had to double the dressing amount as I used 1 lb of penne pasta.  I only used red bell pepper.  When it came to the dressing...I mixed the oil, lime juice and spices in a bowl and whisked them all together. This way, I added the chili powder 1 tbsp at a time and tasted until it was to my liking....which is spicey! Wonderful salad..I am sharing this!

The recipe is a good base to start with, but I tweaked the spices a bit for my tastes and added some different veggies (what I have on hand), and it comes out great each time...the sauce is really a good and healthy alternative to the mayonnaise pasta salads, that's for sure!

I made this over the weekend for a BBQ.  it was delicious!!  I will definitely be making it again!!   I added a chopped red onion and some green onions.  Since we like spicy foods, I was pretty generous with the chili powder.  My husband said This is DEFINITELY a keeper!

First recipe I came across on the allrecipes spinner app.  I follow the recipe as listed, did add more lime juice & cumin (love the combo).  Excellent side dish with grilled chicken or portabella mushrooms.  Makes a very good main dish for a vegan.

Tasty and pretty!  Pretty oily, I'd use a full box of pasta next time and increase the lime juice and decrease the oil.  A nice summer dinner with leftovers for lunch!

Was excellent, even the one of us who doesn't like pasta salad said that it was ok. Would have been better if I remembered to put in the tomatoe(I hate them and still think it would be better to have them in it).

I thought the instruction to add the dressing and then let it cool was a little odd - I've never done that before.  But I followed that instruction and it seemed to keep the pasta moist and put the flavor in the pasta rather than just any old where it lands.  Also made it a bit of an odd color so it certainly looked a bit different.  In the end, I thought was OK but nothing terribly exciting.  Not a bad way to use up some ingredients.

Liked this recipe. I used "fiesta style" can corn which has green and red peppers already in it. Added some cayenne pepper, onions, and a dash of red wine vinegar. Also, a teaspoon of sugar makes a huge difference. Very yummy!

This is always well received at picnics, potlucks, barbecues. One note, if I make this ahead of time, I don't add the chopped fresh tomato until right before serving, keeps the tomatos from getting mushy.

I just made this pasta dish for the first time and it turned out great! I added sliced black olives but other than that follwed the recipe wih no modifications. Unlike the other reviewers I did not have a problem with the pasta being dry but I think they may have used to much pasta...you're only supposed to use half the box:) Next time I will double the recipe and make more. I'm sure this won't last long at the superbowl party tomorrow!!

I've made this salad twice now . both times to take to a potluck and it is a HUGE hit, TWICE! Especially with the men folk it seems. Its absolutely delicious ! And pleasing to the eye with the colors and combinations. I will definately add this to my list of favorite salad recipes.

Really good base recipe, of course I tweak everything.  I doubled the recipe and added lots of browned chorizo and the drippings the next day, yum!  I did one can kidney beans and one black beans, it was super!  ***Definitely better if you let flavors soak in overnight***

This recipe is pretty good if you spice it up a little.  I used lots more lime juice, and added chopped onions, and jalapenos.

I had to modify the recipe a bit for a "health-conscious" work potluck.  I used extra virgin olive oil and whole wheat pasta.  The only suggestions I would have is to maybe add a touch more salt and some pepper, and definitely a bit more lime juice.  Very colorful and pretty, went over very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very pretty but tasteless.  I used all fresh ingredients and followed the recipe exactly.  Boring.

I liked this, but I felt as though it needed something. I followed the recipe to the letter, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I even added a diced, seeded jalapeno pepper. I'll see if the taste improves by the morning, as others have confirmed it does taste better the next day.

Delicious and refreshing. I added 2 splenda packets to bring out the flavor of the corn & beans. Also only used 1/2 cup oil and that was plenty.

This was the BEST pasta salad I've had in a long time.  It was fresh and healthy tasting, and a nice break from the ordinary versions.  I ran out of lime, so I used a Tbs of Havana Lime and Garlic Marinade by Lowrys and a generous squirt of lemon juice to substitute.  I also retossed it with an extra Tbs of oil before serving after it became dry in the fridge.

Made this for a picnic, so I doubled the pasta and sauce, but left the veggies as written.  Everyone liked it, though it did seem a tad dry after sitting for a little while in the fridge.  Next time I think I'll keep a lime on hand to squeeze over it just before serving.

I really liked this recipe, but I highly recommend making it up a day ahead of time.  The first night I thought it was good, but "needed something" and I couldn't decide what. Then we had the leftovers the next night and couldn't get enough of it, the flavors had melded together overnight and hubby and I both agreed that it was MUCH better on night two.  I used multi-grain spiral pasta, used live oil instead of vegetable oil, and added some chopped onion.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I plan to make this again for an upcoming BBQ in a couple of weeks.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions on this with the following exceptions: used dark red kidney beans because I didn't have black beans, and used grilled corn instead of canned.  I used farfalle pasta.  I thought it was OK.  It did have a pretty fresh test.  Not bad, but not great.  I found the flavor of the lime and chili powder pretty strong.  If I try it again sometime, I would tone down the dressing and maybe put in some diced grilled chicken and a little red onion.  I think it would taste better as more like a pico de gallo type base.

After some minor changes, this is a fantastic pasta salad!

I used the juice from 4 limes, only about 1 tsp of chili powder, substituted the cumin for coriander and used dried cilantro (although I would prefer fresh, I was out).

This was a fine recipe, but not great.  I don't plan to make it again.  It's nutritious, which is nice, but the taste was just okay.  My brother thought the spices were weird and my sister didn't like the beans.

Great addition to a buffet table or pot luck!  Very pretty and healthy to boot!  I use tri-colour pasta as well.  I have left out the tomatoes as they can be fairly expensive where I live and no one whose had it with them even noticed.  Warning though, I have put in too much lime juice!  I now follow the ingredient amounts faithfully and have never been disappointed!

This is a delicious pasta salad and it looks pretty too.  I followed some other advice and doubled the cumin and added a tsp of sugar.  Also added about a 1/4 cup of chives to give it a kick.  Didn't give it 5 starts because it does taste like something is missing... I just can't put my finger on it.

I thought it was great would make it again, husband thought it was great. It is a different spin in pasta salad. I used beef stake tomato instead of plum. Would recommend, but when serving at a party think of the people you are serving it to, if they do not like to try different things do not make. You will have left overs. If you like to try different things this is the refreshing way to go a great summer dish.

I LOVED this combination of flavors.   I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less oil (I used olive oil), halved grape tomatoes and also cubed pepperjack cheese.  I didn't have any chili powder, so I just added cayenne pepper (a couple teaspoons) and an extra clove of garlic.  so good!  I even added sauteed shrimp to the leftovers for a yummy dinner pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so easy to make and tastes terrific. I've made it twice so far. Once for my family I added chicken to make a main meal, and once as a side for a picnic. Without the meat it can take the heat of being outside for a while.

I've made this before, and the flavors are all really good together. I like to add crumble queso fresco or similar cheese to it also. Great recipe.

Easy and delicious.  I added chicken (shredded from a cooked one from a grocery store), used whole wheat pasta and fresh corn, and everyone loved it!!

A definite keeper.  My boyfriend loved it (and he is very picky).  So easy to scoop out and bring for lunch at work, and pretty healthy also.

I thought this was a unique twist on your traditional pasta salad. I made this for my son's birthday party and it went over good. I will add more seasoning though next time because I thought it was a tad bland.

Loved this salad!  It was easy and was loved by all at my office.  It was so nice to deviate from the "traditional" pasta salads.

Really great the first day; not too good the second day (reason for only 4 stars).  I sub'd whole wheat pasta and grape tomatoes since that's what I had on hand.  I didn't refrigerate it the first day; just ran the pasta under cold water, drained, tossed, and served.  Very tasty!  But, by day two, it lost all the spice and was pretty bland.  However, this was a nice, summery salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutly loved this salad.  It wasn't too oily, or too spicy, it was just right.  I will definetly make this salad again.  It was very nice change from the same ordinary pasta salad.

This recipe was fabulous!!!  We made it for my boyfreind's parents who cook gourmet food as a hobby when they came into town, and they LOVED it.  It was so fresh and healthy tasting, but also very flavorful.  We used orzo pasta and it really turned out well.  Thanks!

I love this salad! It makes a great main course salad or a side for anything bbq'd. Bottled lime juice will do in a pinch, but fresh is better!

This was an attractive salad that made a good addition to a cook-out.  I'll work to add a little more zing to this salad ... but it's definitely a keeper.
