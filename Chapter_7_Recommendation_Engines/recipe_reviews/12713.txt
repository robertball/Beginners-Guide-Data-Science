I do not know what I did wrong but this was gross!The fish was very mushy even though it was cooked through. 4 cups of bread crumbs was entirely too much! I do not recommend (Sorry Dick! if you can tell me what I did wrong, please let me know!)

I made this for company, with a few small changes, and it was just wonderful!  I used store bought stuffing and added extra sage and nutmeg to it.  It took longer to cook than 30 minutes, but I will make it again.  The sauce was terrific!  A bit like a Newburg sauce...

If I could give this recipe ZERO, I would.  Whatever you do, don't make it.  I promise you'll be disappointed.  It was the most disgusting thing I've ever had.  Whoever wrote this recipe probably left out some necessary ingredients and steps.  The stuffing flavor was ok but texture was disgusting, even after I tried adding eggs.  Just water and bread crumbs?  I dont think so.  Also cooking fish in cream is a bad, bad idea -- they turn to total mush.  Admittedly I put too much cream (being unfamiliar with cooking with cream) but the recipe didnt specify that you shouldn't add ALL of the cream -- not even half of it!

The stuffing needs some chicken broth, butter, or something instead of the egg.  We did not care for this recipe.

I gave this recipe four stars because it was fairly easy to prepare, yet is very impressive looking and would be a great dish to serve to guests. I would have given it five stars, but my husband and I felt the stuffing lacked flavor. It needed something to spice it up a little bit. Could have used a tad more salt too. Maybe seasoned salt would have added some more flavor.  My husband and I agreed that the next time we make it we might add a little crushed red pepper or cayenne to the stuffing. It is definitely a recipe that got printed in hard copy and added to my recipe box of favorite staple dishes.

I liked this recipe.  I used toasted, crumbled bread (food processor) for my stuffing base instead of bread crumbs.  I also used a fairly big casserole dish so the fish wasn't submerged in sauce; that might cause it to get mushy.  Finally, I sprinked with Parmesean cheese, instead of Cheddar.  1lb. of fish was enough for 3 people, because the stuffing helps fill you up.

Sorry but this didnt come out very well at all.  everyone scraped off the topping and just ate the fish because they were hungry.   I have much better recipes that I know are good for the future.

The stuffed flounder in the pan , the sherry cream "sauce" that was in the pan and the plated up variety.   I will admit I had no parsley for garnish so I sprinkled it with paprika.

I don't know where to start.
1.   Cream sauces break when boiled....350 degrees in the oven and you can bet the sauce broke into curds.
2.   NUTMEG?   I gave it a try.   Perhaps my freshly ground nutmeg was stronger than the canned variety, but DANG my tongue went numb trying to eat this

The stuffing had plenty of flavor....not good flavor....but flavor.

I can only think someone was yanking our chain when they put this recipe into the database.
I should have just broiled plain fish.   so much for being adventurous.

Other reviews said the fish was mush....mine was fine.   We scraped the stuffing off and the curdled cream off and just ate the fish.   At $11 a pound for flounder I wanted to cry.   Thankfully it was just me and the kids who were eating this.
