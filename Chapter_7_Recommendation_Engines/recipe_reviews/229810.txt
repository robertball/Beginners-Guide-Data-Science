The flavors go well together.  I had to slice the Brussels Sprouts really thin to get that shredded look.  Next time, I might just quarter them!  When I have some, I'll give fresh cranberries a try in this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Didn't have orange juice, so I used the juice of an orange.  No pecans, so I waited and put toasted almond slices on top to serve.  Also, I quartered the brussel sprouts rather than have them all chopped up.  As they cooked they separated wonderfully!  No cranberries, so I added golden raisins with the ginger!  Perfectly Perfect!

Came across this recipe while looking for something that DIDN'T have bacon in it.  I really liked the ginger orange combination and the sweet cranberries.  However, I personally felt that the ginger was a little over-powering.

I loved this recipe although I did make a few changes for our tastes.  I used butter (just because I felt like it)
I reduced the cranberries to 1/4 cup, the ginger to 1 teaspoon and added 4 oz of crispy pancetta (because we can't find enough recipes to put it in). A pinch of cornstarch brought it to the perfect consistency immediately before serving.  I cut my sprouts in half and blanched them for 4 minutes before adding them to the butter and the rest. Pecans:.....just a small handful, chopped (I have a small hand). :-)

The flavors blend so nicely together. I made it in my wok so  cleaning up the stove was easier.  Will be making this again!

This was good.  Made it exactly as written.  I suppose one day it would be fun to try adding . . .bacon . . . but then, the whole point of this recipe is b. sprouts without the usual needed-to-make-them-tasty bacon  which all the other recipes have.  This is a very festive side dish at a holiday table.

Good medly of flavors. I feel the ginger amount in the recipe is way too overpowering, and would reduce it to 1/2 teaspoon, then add to your taste liking from there - 1 TBSP is just way too much. Otherwise this is a nice change with yummy combo of tart and sweet and savory.

This was excellent as a xmas dinner side, everyone ate it right up! The only difference I made to it was I sauteed a few cloves of garlic before adding the brussel sprouts. It is so good, we are having it again tonight! Thank you so much for sharing!!

I had cherries rather than cranberries. They were way over powering. 1/4 cup would probably work better. I only put in 1tsp of fresh ginger because of previous ratings. It was not enough. 1/4 cup of orange juice evaporated the instant I added it. 3/4 cup lasted for the suggested 5 min.

Needed salt! I had to do substitutions (tangerine juice, dried chopped dates and apricots) but it lacked a sprinkle of salt to draw out the flavor. Otherwise, pretty good!

Delicious - liked by even non Brussel Sprout people. Reduce the carbs by using fresh squeezed orange juice.

Made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  Next time I will add some extra toasted pecans to top it off after making for a little added crunch.

I made this recipe from a video I saw on this site that was very close to this one except it had no pecans, cranberries and used dry ginger.  I used fresh ginger and no nuts or berries and enjoyed these brussel sprouts but I think the nuts and berries would really compliment this very nicely.  Thanks for taking this recipe a little further!  I look forward to trying it your way!  I suspect that would raise it to 5 stars!
