This was a really good recipe.  I liked the beef and it totally fell apart after about 13 hours of cooking.  And I only used 3 cups of tequila because that is all that I had.  That was plenty for the roast I had.  I agree that the rice was too much.  I made 2 cups instead of 3 and threw away  over half of it.  I think 1 cup of rice would probably be about right.  I put my enchiladas into a 9 x 13 pan and I could only fit 6 in the pan.  So I made a second pan and froze it.  My husband requested that there be more sauce, but otherwise everything tasted great.  I like the mix of spicy and mild sauce, it gave it a subtle  heat.

These enchiladas are very good. The meat  turns out simply scrumptious (I used beef and chicken). All together, it is rather labor-intensive but definitely worth the work. With all the ingredients, it is certainly tasty -beans, meat, cheese, with just the right amount of kick- it is worth the time and effort it takes to get this together. I had a bunch of rice and beans left over, so I served them on the side. Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty meat! This recipe makes lots of enchiladas and I froze a portion of them--hope that works out well. I would agree with other reviewer that the amount of rice is too much, otherwise ratio of ingredients great.

I was going to make Mexican red rice to put in them but decided to do it the way the recipe says, and so glad I did. These turned out so yummy. Will definitely make them again.

These were awesome! The meat was flavorful and tender. 

Will definitely make again with a few small modifications: 

Cut the rice in half. All other ingredients were portioned perfectly, but I have a ton of leftover rice. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the green chiles on top of the cheese. I will omit those next time and add cilantro.
