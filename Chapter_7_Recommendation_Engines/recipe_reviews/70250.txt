This was great! I did add some spices to the tops of the chicken breasts. I added garlic powder, pepper, red pepper flakes and some rosemary leaves. It really was a great dish and definitely one that will impress dinner guests. I served it with linguine noodles mixed with olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, rosemary and garlic, which was a great complement to the flavors of the chicken. Thanks!

This recipe is good.  As stated by a previous reviewer, you will be doing a bit of prep work but it will be worth it.  I agree that the chicken should be baked and then broiled to be crispy on the outside (if that is what you like).  I agree about sliced cheese versus shredded.  I agree that roast red peppers add a great flavor.  Next time I will experiment by adding some spinach or asparagus which may add to the elegance of this dish.
7/17/07 I did add the asparagus to the chicken for a dinner party and it was delicious.  It was so pretty to see the red, white and green inside the chicken.  I think it needs a sauce over the top though.  I will continue to perfect this recipe.

Very nice dish. The flavors all work well together and the presentation is pretty and colorful. I seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper and didn't bother mixing the seasonings, Parmesan and chives, just sprinkled them on the chicken one by one. Just a matter of personal taste I guess, but the only thing I didn't like about this was the dried Italian seasoning, which I found unpleasantly harsh. I would have much preferred fresh, even if it meant choosing only one herb to save on cost--fresh basil, for instance, would be wonderful! Loved the addition of the roasted red pepper. I made this easy on myself by baking this at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes, which browned the chicken beautifully. I served this with fresh asparagus and "Elegant Orzo with Wilted Spinach and Pine Nuts," also from this site.

This is a definite 5 star recipe. I added marinated artichokes w/ the filling (which added even more flavor), and I put italian dressing over the chicken instead of olive oil. I will make this chicken dish again!

So flavorful!  Make sure you don't overcook.  I thought it tasted best when the red bell peppers were in every bite, not spaced out inside the chicken.

This chicken was great! Just like the recipe said looked like it came out of a fancy restaurant, but was very easy to make. We did use the Italian blend cheese and we also added fresh minced garlic inside the chicken. we will defintely make this again.

Love this chicken recipe!  The description is correct.  I made this for mother's day dinner and the family commented it looked like something we could have ordered in a high end restaurant. I served over a simple wild mushroom and artichoke risotto. Easy to make.  I used an italian blend of cheeses instead of mozzarella, still was excellent.  I will be making this again and again!

A few years ago, this recipe was my first attempts to cooking anything.  I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out awesome.  My friends all thought I was a seasoned veteran at cooking!  All the compliments gave me more confidence to keep cooking.  I experimented with the ingredients time to time.  A great alternative is substituting the mozzarella for  crumbled feta, add quartered marinated artichokes (drained) in the filling, then once cooked,  top with sliced Greek olives.  I serve that version with couscous.  De-lish!

This was a good recipe. It was easy to make, and the cleanup was simple too. I added a couple of slices of fresh mozzarella to the top of each chicken while it baked. I would make this again.

Rather than roll the chicken around the filling, I simply flattened the beasts, arranged the filling on one half, then folded the other half over (book-style).  I did secure them closed with a skewer, then browned them on both sides in a skillet before finishing them in the oven.  As others have said, a lot of variations can be made to this dish!

This was a great recipe!  This was my first time ever making anything like this.  My guests and i loved this, which was from a 1 1/2 year old to a 27 year old.  My fiance loved this and can't wait till the next time i make it, and my future best man, his wife, and little son loved it also.  When they saw their plates our guests were under the impression that that either the meal had to be prepared the night before or that it was something that someone else prepared and i cooked.  I listened to the comments of other reviewers and added garlic and an italian marinade to the mixture and it came out amazing, i followed Crumpets recomendations and broiled for the last ten minutes and I believe that it was definitely worth it.  The broiling added a beautiful browning affect and also adding the crispy/crunchy factor.  I 'm definitely looking forward to the next time i make this. With broiling this meal had the perfect combination of savory spices, melted cheese, and a crispy exterior to make this a salivating sense-stimulating combination of a meal.

Great recipe! I made enough for myself for dinner (1 stuffed chicken) and ate it with some spaghetti that I lightly tossed in an olive oil/bread crumb/ parmesan cheese mixture. I read the other reviews and made some slight changes beforehand because I hate wasting ingredients and I'm not really big on measuring equipment. First, too make sure that the chicken was flavorful and juicy after butterflying the chicken breats I seasoned both sides with a little of the following: garlic powder, lemon and pepper seasoning, cayenne pepper, and italian seasonings. I then put the seasoned chicken breast in a zip lock bag and pounded the seasonings into it on both  sides (top and bottom; i flipped the bag over). I then sprinkled the chicken with parmesan cheese, then put the red bell pepper pieces on it, then the chives, then a little bit of minced garlic, and then an italian mixture of shredded cheeses (NOTE: do not go overboard on these ingredients because too much will make it hard to roll up). I then rolled the chicken, placed the toothpicks into the rolled chicken, and then brushed on olive oil. Before putting on baking sheet I lightly sprayed it with PAM so the chicken roll would not stick. I baked for the same amount of time as directed in the original recipe. The chicken came out so juicy and flavorful. My mom snuck a bite while my back was turned and automatically asked for the recipe. Thanks for posting!

This dish was ok. My father & brother loved it but I was not crazy about it. I used the block mozzarella as suggested by others but found it very difficult to roll the chicken. I would suggest using shredded mozzarella. I baked the chicken for 30 minutes at 350 and broiled for 15 minutes & the chicken was cooked perfectly. I may make this dish again.

I tried this with a few modification and it turned out devine. I marinated 3 chicken breast in lite Itailian dressing for about an hour. I used about 2-3 tsp. of dried parsley in place of the chives & mixed it with the parmesan cheese. I was out of mozzarella but used an Italian cheese blend in it's place. Prepared as directed but had a little cheese left over since I only prepared 3 breast, sprinkled the leftover cheese on top of the chicken and added a few sprinkles of dried red bell pepper/garlic blend . Didn't use any salt as I felt that the jarred roasted red peppers and Italian dressing added enough sodium. Looked great and tasted wonderful.

Wow!!!! Everyone wasn't kidding when they said this recipe was excellent! I tweaked it just a little as noted from other viewers. I marinated the breast in Italian dressing,and used sliced mozzarella cheese instead of shredded.  Then followed recipe as indicated. Also,  steamed some asparagus to serve atop. (Highly recommend stuffing the chicken with the asparagus). I made a Alfredo sauce(Rebecca Swift). Found her recipe from this site to accompany the chicken like one viewer suggested . I tossed fettuccine noodles with the Alfredo and placed on plate. Placed sliced Chicken Valentino atop and then arranged the steamed asparagus nicely and finished off this delicious dish with a drizzle of Alfredo sauce. Absolutely tasty and defiantly a dish to impress your guests. My 3yr old son whom is a very picky eater. Kept saying this is delicious mom good job! While fist bumping me too cute I know... Thanks everyone's for your comments. :)

Just made this for dinner tonight to rave reviews by my husband. I used goat cheese instead of mozz, and added basil leaves, sun dried tomatoes, chives, and a spinach leaf to each. I marinated the chicken first for about an hour as suggested in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and lemon pepper seasoning. I stuffed them, skewered them and browned on the stove and then baked at 350 for 25 minutes. I happened to have some leftover roasted veggies, so I pureed them with a bit of chicken broth and poured that over before baking. It was delicious. We served with a salad of corn, tomato, and green beans with an olive oil and red wine vinegar vinaigrette. A very yummy meal --I will make again. The recipe was a great jumping off point for a lot of variations-Thank You!

Quite easy. I made this last minute, after reading a rave review. Instead of chives, I used fresh basil leaves. I did carefully sear the chicken on the outsides in the EVOO before transferring it to the baking dish and finishing the cooking process. I served this with hot pasta that I tossed with melted butter, parmesan cheese, basil and sea salt/fresh ground pepper. Not a scrap left. Kind of wish I made a recipe and a half because my husband was bummed there wasn't more. This one's a keeper. NOTE: I was interesed in this recipe because it called for jarred roasted red peppers, which I had found at my local Dollar Tree. This didn't cost much to make at all.

Delicious and definitely "company worthy" - everybody loved it. I served it with my homemade marinara sauce, instead of Alfredo, to cut down on calories and fat.

Excellent recipe! So easy to make - and it's delicious! I added frozen spinach to the recipe to add a little color and leafy flavor, and it was fabulous. I make it all the time now! LOVE IT!

This recipe is a keeper. I marinated the flattened chicken in vinaigrette overnight and used chopped fresh basil, chives, garlic, parmesan, and herbs de provence.  Omitted the salt, italian seasoning and olive oil.  Based on other comments I doubled the cheese (I used block mozzarella & sliced it) and the roasted red peppers - so glad I did!  Added asparagus which I would say is an essential ingredient.  I rolled some and folded the others in half as a comparison.  Both were beautifully presented but I prefer the folded chicken as you can stuff more in them and it seemed less dry.  Poured the marinade over the chicken, sprinkled with a bit more parmesan and herbs, and cooked for 20 min (no broiling) but 15 probably would have been just fine.  Served with Back-Burner Ratatouille which blended well and gave the chicken a much-needed sauce, and some yummy garlic bread   Excellent!  Almost better as a leftover.

This was pretty great. We opted to use fresh basil instead of fresh chives and I'm glad we did. We also crusted the outside with dried spices, panko bread crumbs, and Parmesan reggiano crumbles. We served with mashed redskin potatoes and fresh steamed asparagus. The pasta seemed to heavy for us for dinner and the potatoes and asparagus worked very well. The one thing we wanted more of was a creamier cheese paired with a more pungent cheese. We thought of next time using a very small slice of cream cheese (you have to go very easy with this stuff when stuffing) with asiago or romano. We also forgot to salt the inside of the butterflied chicken which I don't recommend. Lastly, we opted not to roll the breasts as in our experience this dries out the meat faster (more stuffing leaks out). We instead just closed up the butterflied pieces with toothpicks and baked it like a normal looking chicken breast. Overall it was very delicious! For those of you who haven't butterflied and flattened before, its easiest when you put the butterflied chicken spread open between 2 pieces of wax paper. Use a rolling pin or canned food to apply blunt pressure repeatedly. Be careful not to focus on one side as this will make holes. It's best to start in the middle and work your way to the outside. This will flatten the breasts so you can stuff them easily.

Great recipe...lots of flavor!  Next time I will add more roasted peppers and probably add some cheese over the top before serving.  The 'middle' cuts (with the peppers and cheese) were fabulous, but there wasn't quite enough to go around for the 'outside' chicken pieces.

I am giving this one a 4 star .. I would really give it a 4 1/2 if I had the opportunity. 
I liked it.  The presentation was amazing -- I added a couple of spears of roasted asparagus in with the roasted bell peppers.  The addition was gorgeous!  I served it over the mushroom risotto recipe from here and it was yummy.  
The chicken itself needed something.  I think maybe more spices in the coating like a few others have done.  Next time I will add:  a touch of red pepper, garlic powder, and maybe even poultry seasoning, although I wouldn't want it to get too salty.
I won't give up on this one -- just needs a tweak or two ...

I love this recipe its so easy to make and the chicken comes out very tender and juicy. I only made a few changes. I wrapped the chicken breast roll in uncooked bacon before I put it in the oven. Cooked it at the same temperature and time and it came out perfect. I also replaced the roasted red bell peppers with sun-dried tomatoes and it made a HUGE difference, added a lot more flavor and complexity to the dish.

I made this the other night and it was very popular with my husband.  I made a few changes based on the reviews I read.  I used Herbs de Provence and sprinkled them inside the chicken breast, as well as on the outside.  Someone mentioned this dish needed a sauce, so rather than drizzling olive oil on top, I put a can of condensed cream of chicken soup on top.  I also baked it for 20 minutes or so at 400 degrees.  The only thing I would change again would be to add less salt as the cheese is rather salty.  I served it on top of linguine that was boiled according to the package, then cooked in oil and spices and herbs for a few minutes.

Pretty good and fun to make; adding lots of fresh basil leaves inside makes it  a five star recipe.

We REALLY enjoyed this! I had a jar of garlic & olive oil marinated peppers I used in this. Yum! I did make an alfredo sauce to serve over it but we actually preferred it without. To the leftovers today, I just melted some mozz/provolone mix over the top & it's sooo good!

WOW! This recipe is everything its cracked up to be, and more!  I have been nervous about trying internet recipes lately because every time ive made one they have been terrible. But this was amazing! I changed a couple things, nothing major. Instead of italian seasoning (i find that to be a pretty strong seasoning) i used dried basil. Instead of chives, i chopped up some green onion. I served it over angelhair pasta, and topped it with a simple parmesan alfredo sauce. We will be making this again for sure!. ps. the flatter you pound your chicken, the easier it rolls! so flatten it as much as you possibly can!

This was really good - my husband and son said to "flag" this one as a definite keeper - I used pre-marinated Italian chicken breasts, didn't roll them just layered the roasted peppers and cheese on top and baked it for 35 minutes - really really good!

Very tasty dish. The Parmesan / chives mixture was excellent along with the addition of red roasted peppers as an ingredient. I made a couple of alterations:1. I did sprinkle one chicken breast with olive oil and salt & pepper but sprinkled the rest of the chicken breasts with lemon pepper spice on the other chicken breasts without the olive oil for comparison purposes. The lemon pepper topping tasted better. 2.  Rather than broiling the chicken, I baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes and it turned out great. I will definitely make this dish again.

Well, I hate to say this when everyone else thought so highly of this recipe--we thought it was OK, but nothing spectacular. It was easy enough to make, but I don't know if we will finish off the leftovers. Maybe it was because I don't have a good recipe for alfredo sauce to top it with--we just ate the chicken rolls over rice. I thought it was kind of bland and won't be making again. Followed the recipe exactly.

This chicken is always a hit! When I make it, I add fresh asparagus to the filling and a little extra mozzarella cheese.  I slice the chicken breasts at an angle after they have finished baking then serve over angel hair pasta that I tossed in the baked chicken drippings.  What a colorful delight!

It was just okay.  A lot of prep work and the end result was not that interesting.  The cheese melted out of the chicken, the italian seasoning had a enough of a kick, but without the cheese it was a little boring.

I cannot believe a recipe so healthy could be so tasty.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of salt, which I sprinkled in the baking dish and then on top of the chicken.  My husband took a bite and "it made his mouth happy".  Definitely a dish I will make for my next dinner party.

Easy and elegant! The boyfriend loved it. 
I only made a few changes-- I added sun-dried tomatoes and minced garlic to the filling and then arranged the leftover filling on top as a garnish. The tanginess gave it a nice kick! Will DEF make again.

This was a nice change with chicken. I added my own spices instead of italian seasoning, basil, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, tarragon. I put some chopped green onions down over the whole thing then some strips of fresh mozzarella and orange roasted pepper strips and rolled up. Added some italian dressing over the top and baked till done. Drizzled some of the 'sauce' over the chicken to serve. I just added what cheese oozed out onto the top of the chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just "OK" in my opinion. I think IF I make it again next time I will filet the breasts in half and then cut them down the middle and THEN pound them out & roll them up individually. There was so much chicken that you couldn't really taste the filling.

I added garlic and onion powders to the Parmesan-chive mixture. Roasted my own red bell peppers and also added some sliced mushrooms and shredded pepper jack cheese before rolling up the chicken. Definitely baste the chicken halfway through and again close to the end with the juices in the dish. It ends up making it very moist.

Healthy, yet bursting with flavor! I modified the recipe to include: 3 cloves garlic, sundried tomato instead of red bell pepper, and 1/2 c. frozen spinach. I added the spinach, without drying it to maintain moisture in the chicken. We like stuffed chicken bursting with filling so I made 1.5 timed the amount needed. It turned out extremely flavorful, and the healthy component made it a recipe to repeat!

Good recipe. I like many others added additional seasoning to suit our taste (garlic powder, onion powder and extra italian seasoning). The cheese melted right out of the chicken which was disappointing, but the crisp outside from the quick broil was nice.

Great dish!  The roasted red peppers add so much to this dish.  This will become a staple dish in my home.  Highly recommended.  I added the asparagus as suggested by another reviewer and I will make it no other way.  Five stars...more if I could!

Actually made these ahead of time and rolled them in aluminum foil, reheated on the grill while camping. They were wonderful! Moist with great flavor! Followed the recipe aside from marinating the chicken breasts overnight in Italian dressing while they were thawing.

Did not have very much flavor like I was expecting it too.  I was expecting it to have a rich italian flavor with all the cheeses, however it was pretty bland.

I made this excellent dish a couple of nights ago and my husband is still talking about it! With a few exceptions, I followed the recipe. I added 1 link of chorizo (chopped small), subbed two thick slices of onion because i didn't have chives, added 1 large clove garlic because other reviewers recommended it, and added mozzarella and Parmesan to the top as well. I really liked the extra flavor chorizo added. It was delicious. I'll definitely make this again. it presents beautifully.

Made this last night and it was very good. I added red pepper flakes, garlic powder and basil to the top. Also added marinated asparagus spears to the middle. Be sure you have enough time for preparation, it took a little longer than I thought it would.

Although this dish is still in the oven, it smells good, my only issue was I wasn't sure if I should cook the chicken first or not... after doing the preparations, I decided next time (my second attempt) I will not cook the chicken first... because I think it only rolls good when the chicken is not cooked; nevertheless I'm sure it'll taste just great!  Thanks for submitting it... it's also a cost friendly recipe.  :D

Alright, I tried it a second time without cooking the chicken first and it was a hit!  Even my husband enjoyed and he informed for the first time that chicken isn't really his favorite... :D

Loved this recipe!  The only thing I do differently is to spread the chicken breasts with a tablespoon each of pesto before putiing on the red peppers and cheese.  I also used an oven prood skillet and browned them on the stove top before putting them in the oven, thus eliminating the broiling.  Will be making these many times.  Thanks.

VERY GOOD, followed to a T except I baked for 30 min. but did not do the broiling.  Next time I will use more roasted red peppers, like some in every bite. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic! The "best thing I've ever made" my boyfriend claimed. I used fresh red bell peppers and added extra oregano and basil to the initial seasoning. Also, marinating the chicken prior to prep is a good idea. All and all, it was a great meal!

This is a good company dish.  Easy and delicious. I sprinkled everything over the chicken breasts as they were large.  Made early in day, refrigerated them and then baked for a total of 30 mins instead of broiling for the last 15 mins. Will make them again.

WOW!  This is a winner in my recipe box!  I've also used  chopped up smoked sun dried julienne-cut tomatoes and salt-free all purpose seasoning (blened of herbs and spices).  Served it on top of sauteed mustard greens (spinach or kale would taste good too).  Thanks for great recipe!!!

Wow was this flavorful!  Even my husband who hates bell peppers loved this.  I made a few simple changes, mainly because I forgot, I didn't use olive oil or the salt and pepper.  Instead I just sprinkled the chicken with Mrs. Dash Italian Blend, I also used marinated red bell peppers.  We served it with spaghetti noodles and a garden pasta sauce.  Delicious.

This is pretty good.  Made as directed except I baked for 40 minutes.  (No broiling)  Won't be a regular, but will be made again.  Note:  The leftovers are 5 stars.  The flavors really blend.

I love this recipe and every time I make it I get asked for a copy of it.  There are just a few changes that I made.  I use fresh red pepper, didn't have the others and I used Provel cheese instead of motz.  I just like it better.  I also sprinkle some parm cheese on top right before serving.  This is a great dish and full of flavor!  I have made it several times and it only gets better with practice!  Trust me if you make this they will be wanting more!

This is a great recipe-I did make a few modifications since I kept reading that it was a little dry-I baked mine in the oven in a baking dish with a can of chicken broth.  I also added pepperoni on the inside and seasoned with Montreal Chicken seasoning.  I also added sliced mozzarella instead of shredded inside and out-baked it for 1 hr at 350-I bake Sunday dinner at my house every week for about 13 people and they all raved!!  I served with fettuccini and roasted red bell pepper alfredo-FANTASTIC!!

This was probably the best chicken I've ever made!!  I made a few changes because many reviewers said it was bland. Basically I added more spices, including garlic powder, and poured italian dressing + tomato sauce over chicken before baking.  It turned out fabulous!!!  I can't wait to "show off" to my friends!

The first time I made this as written, it was good, so 4 stars.  The next time I made it, we had company, and I decided to dress it up a bit.  I used sliced cheese instead of shredded, and it stayed inside the roll much better.  I also added a slice of prosciutto to the inside of each roll and seasoned my chicken before I placed the peppers, cheese, and prosciutto on it.  This was much better, as I felt the chicken was a little bland originally.  The next time I make it, I may tinker with making some sort of sauce for it, because it just seems that a sauce would punch it up that much more.  This is an excellent recipe and is really open to a lot of experimentation.  Give it a shot!

This was super yummy!  We didn't have mozz cheese, but used an Italian mix (pre-bagged) and it turned out great!  The only thing different is I would add extra cheese :)

What a great recipe and something truly different from the old chicken circuit! I used munenster cheese in place of the mozzarella cheese and green onion in place of the chive, simply because that's what I had. I also served it with sliced avacado on the side. 

What makes this recipe so great is that you can pretty much use any type of cheese you like (have) and I suspect it would taste just as good. The roasted red peppers make the difference and will go with just about any cheese!

So good!!!  My whole family loved it.  I added some fresh spinach leaves in the chicken.  Also put some extra cheese on top in the last few minutes so it could melt.  Will  absolutely make this again!

I thought this chicken was very tasty.  In my opinion, this chicken would benefit from the addition of a piece of deli smoked ham with the stuffing.  I found this to be a great menu option when trying to impress guests who are watching fat.  I currently am cooking low to no-fat due to a dietary restriction for a family member.  She was able to eat this because I tweaked the recipe, using no fat mozzerella, and low fat parmesan cheese topping.  I skipped the oil drizzle over the top. Although I don't always recommend low-fat cheeses, I thought the flavor of the pepper and scallions (I had no chives) really compensated for this alteration.  The cooking time was incorrect for my oven, and in the future I would bake at 350 for longer and skip the broiling.  This would also be great breaded.

Very good! My family loved it. I served it with a chicken gravy that I had left over. I felt that it did need a sauce of some kind. I look forward to making this for guests.

A really nice recipe that presented itself very well. I used the Italian four cheeses that's already shredded. I took the advice of another reviewer and made a garlic cream sauce to spoon over the top while baking. Very delicious Crumpet!

This is delicious. And gorgeous. I used spiced Gouda instead of mozzarella, and I didn't have any chives. I needed to broil for 15 minutes after the 15 minute baking, but that was probably my oven. The flavour combination was perfect; thank you!

This one is a keeper. Next time I make it, I think I'll add a little bit more seasoning to it though. Plus maybe some more cheese. I did add a little garlic powder to the inside and sprinkled  some roasted garlic granules to the outside. My wife loved it!

This was not only delicious, but also lovely to look at when finished. I made it exactly as described. The dish, when done, looks as if it were being served directly form the kitchen of an upscale restaurant. My family loved this....yummy and moist. This is a definite for a dinner party. I will make this again.

This was fabulous and simple to make! I included fresh spinach in my roll ups, and before I tucked it under the broiler, I sprinkled a little XVOO, and balsamic. I topped it with parmesan cheese to soak up the balsamic, and it added a nice crispy topping to the chicken when finished, with a light balsamic taste. 
Great Recipe! Ty for Sharing this Emily Compson Trenbeath!

I am an experienced cook. Grandma and a five star chef taught me. This recipe was fun and absolutely delicious. I made one small change which was adding mushrooms with the mozzarella and I roasted my own red peppers. My mother and father in law were more than impressed. Will definitely be making this again

This is very tasty and easy! The pounding of the chicken breasts is essential. I roasted strips of red pepper on tinfoil in the over w a little olive oil until barely browned, laid that w mozzarella and minced garlic inside then wrapped it up like a roll to bake. Yum! We used the sauce from white cheese chicken lasagna on this site for additional sauciness.

This is a great recipe as is or with some tweaks.  I used 6 Cheese Italian Shreds mixed with 2 oz of cream cheese.  Also added a sprinkle of garlic to salt and pepper, Italian seasoning.  After rolling chicken, dipped in egg wash and breadcrumbs and sauteed lightly before placing in oven.  These were delicious and a keeper.

This my first try at stuffing a chicken breast and it was easier than I thought!! I used a Schwan's 502 chicken breast, sliced it, flattened it and put the ingredients inside. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I put basil, garlic and oregano inside and it was amazing!!

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I changed a few things around a little bit though. I grated Parm on my own from a fresh chunk of the cheese. I didn't use jar roasted red peppers. Instead, the day before, I sliced up red peppers and put it in a pan on the stove with a generous amount of olive oil. When the pepper appears grilled enough, took both the pepper and olive oil and put it into a container. I sliced up chicken breast completely in halves that were thin enough to fold with. I did not use shredded mozzarella cheese. Instead, I used fresh mozzarella and sliced them long. I put those into a ziploc bag and put it in the fridge. I forgot to get chives but the dish tasted amazing nonetheless. The day of, I took each slice of chicken breast, a slice of mozzarella and a few slices of red pepper and rolled it up. I placed them down in a pan, sprinkled italian seasoning, a little bit of salt and pepper, some of the fresh grated parm and drizzled with some of the olive oil from the peppers. Followed the baking directions exactly and YUM!

I did not have fresh chives, but used jarred which really have no flavor. I thought the red peppers were going to be too much so I did not put all 6 oz. I will use more the next time.  I had to turn the chicken and broil another 10 minutes to cook the other side.  All in all, bake 15, broil 10 on each side.

Love this recipe!  Looks complicated on the plate, but it's really quite simple.  I have incorporated a lot of the ideas from other reviewers and they are all great - this recipe leaves lots of room for creative changes.

I did not like one of the spices in the italtian seasoning.  So next time I will choose spices individually to put in instead of that mix.

This was so easy and delicious! I omitted the Italian seasoning and instead of coating with olive oil, I drizzled with Good Seasons balsamic vinaigrette dressing which made a really nice sauce and kept the chicken moist.

This turned out wonderful! My boyfriend, a fairly inexperienced cook, was able to assemble and cook this with no help from me at all. The only bad thing about this recipe is that when we took the chicken out of the oven after broiling, it was still not cooked in some places. It might be because our oven is ancient, but either way, we cooked the chicken on 350 for about 10 more minutes and it still came out moist and tender. Will definitely be making this again!

I modified this dish slightly by marinating the chicken in balsamic vinaigrette dressing for a few hrs, and in addition to the red peppers, green onions, and mozzarella, added some garlic powder and a row of asparagus spears inside. Turned out beautiful and moist! Will totally make again!

My husband is really not a chicken eater.  I made this dish and he loved it!!! He wants to know when I will make it again.  The only thing different that I did was that I placed half slices of swiss cheese on rolled chicken.          reneeq1

I thought this receipe tasted awesome but was disapppointed to look over at my husbands plate and saw all the roasted peppers picked out sitting on the side of the plate.  Mental note to self; no more red peppers unless finely chopped.

This recipes was not to our liking. If it wasn't for the italian seasoning. It would of been tasteless. The chicken was dry. If I make it next time I will marinate it in italian dressing. But not sure their will be a next time with us.

Next time I will go much lighter with the Italian seasoning.  The flavor was too strong.  This was actually better when warmed up the following day.  Will try this again.

I love this chicken recipe for a nice change of pace. It's very simple for beginners, prep is a bit tedius in my opinion but very well worth it. First time I made it exactly as posted. Now I always make extra sauce to pour over the chicken and use a mix of shredded parm and mozz for the chicken filling. I also add a little more cheese than the recipe calls for. Great dish!

I have been making a version of this dish for years, by stuffing the chicken with feta, sundried tomatoes and a few baby spinach leaves, then wrapping in prosciutto.  My guests always comment on it but best of all it's easy enough to make for the family anytime

This was really good.  I tested it before making it for friends (ended up using a different recipe) but it was very tasty.  Followed others' comments about the garlic cheese spread and artichokes.  Turned out fabulous.  Also, since some commented that the chicken needed some extra floavor, I marinated in Kraft Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing for about 30 minutes.  I did make a small batch of roasted red pepper and garlic sauce for the top, but preferred it without, the marinating must have helped.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I just made this recipe for my husband for our valentine's dinner. However, I did make a few minor adjustments. I added crushed garlic to the parm. seasoning and coated both the inside and outside of the chicken with that. I stuffed the way then recipe states. I then made a red pepper sauce with roasted red peppers, garlic and itailan seasoning in a blender, added about 2-3 tbls milk and blended again. Then poured into sauce pan and added about 1/2 can of evaporated milk. simmered and continue to stir. After chicken was done, I cut in half for beauty and poured with sauce. AMAZING!

I followed to recipe almost exactly, but I did add fresh asparagus as one review suggested.  It was easy to make and was beautiful, but was lacking a little in taste.  It absolutely needs a sauce of some sort.  I will make this recipe again, but figure out a tasty tomato sauce for this (I don't generally eat alfredo sauce).  Thanks for the recipe!

A delicious recipe! After reading a few reviews that said the chicken lacked a bit of flavor, I decided to add a light layer of pesto on the chicken, just prior to the parmesan, chives, and seasoning mix. It turned out great! The pesto added to the flavor and kept the chicken very moist... a fact that helped when reheating too. Definitely a favorite, and one I will be repeating! Goes great with fettucini alfredo and a nice white wine.

Really good and super easy! I forgot to pick up the peppers, which is obviously key to the dish, but I sprinkled a generous amount of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Seasoning to give it a little spice.

This was tasty...I really like chicken when it's rolled and stuffed as there are so many variations.  I was only cooking for the 2 of us and had to roast my own peppers and since I had no italian seasoning on hand, I opted for herbes de provence and some granulated garlic.  I drizzled a bit of italian dressing over top instead of olive oil and simply baked at 375 for about 50 mins.  Unfortunately, they ended up a wee bit overdone, but that was my own fault.  Great dish though!

This was just OK for me.  Prepared as written, it just lacked flavor in my opinion.  I think I will try this again, but will definitely season it more that what is called for in the recipe.

This was great. I used a little too much spice inside the chicken, but that was my own fault. I made it with broccoli and paprika potatoes. Excellent and simple!

I had to review this recipe again. Hands down delicious. The fresh chives is the key.... I made this with chicken tenderloins pounded and added some chicken broth and white wine  at the bottom of the baking dish and baked no more than 15 min. A lot of prep, but the result is well worth it. Again, Thank you for sharing.

By far the best recipe I've found on this site so far.  I've served it as is(without sauce), and haven't gotten any comments besides plates that were licked clean.

I rolled up a slice of prosciutto in every breast, and went a little heavier on the parmesan.  Other than that, just make sure you don't over-cook the chicken, and this is one awesome dish.

This was delicious. I omitted the Parmesan cheese because my husband does care for it and I used fresh red peppers. I served it with rice pilaf and a vegetable side dish. Next time I would like to try it with a sauce drizzled over the chicken before serving, just for something different. The chicken was flavorful & moist.  Good recipe! Thank you so much.

This was OK-not as much flavor as I thought it would have, but easy enough to make and beautiful presentation. I think I will add more garlic next time.

Made this for 9 of my closest friends. It went over very well. I also brushed some creamy italian dressing over the chicken before baking as suggested. Tasted great. Served with two different sides of pasta (roasted red pepper sauce & alfredo sauce on this site). Will definitely do again.

I'm not an experienced cook, and this was one of the first recipes I tried. It was delicious, easy, and even my picky fiance loved it--he even asked to take the leftovers to work the next day! I've made it again since and the early success encouraged me to keep cooking! :-)

I'm not a big fan of white meat and I think that's what brought down my rating; to me, white meat is always "dry".  That being said, it really wasn't.  The roasted red peppers and herbs were really tasty!  Might add a bit more cheese next time.  Will make again!

This recipe was very easy, yet looked as though I spent alot of time on it! To add more flavor I poured Italian dressing over the chicken before I baked it, which to me was the perfect touch.  I would definately make this recipe again.

This was a very well presented dish and very easy to make. The flavour was nice but could have had a bit more punch. I didn't have any toothpicks so just rolled the chicken & hoped for the best. It held together perfectly!  Next time I think I will wrap it in proscuttio for some extra flavour.

This was a very impressive recipe for so few ingredients. My 
only change was using slices of mozzarella instead of shredded cheese. It's easier to work with when rolling up the chicken breasts. I also baked it for 30 minutes and then broiled for 10 because my chicken breasts were large. The chicken turned out very moist and tender. The roasted red pepper goes well with the chicken.

As a begining cooker, this recipe was surprisingly easy, but unbelievably good. My family still raves about ever since I made it for them. Just try it!

Made this for Valentine’s Day dinner. Thanks to the comments I added baby spinach, chopped basil, and asparagus.  Pounded Italian seasoning and chives into the breasts til thin and they rolled just fine. Cooked at 375 for about 30 minutes and didn’t broil and it wasn’t dry at all. Served with sautéed whole mushrooms and the remaining asparagus stalks (roasted on the same pan as the chicken) and some homemade marinara. It was a hit!  Very flavor and pretty!  Will definitely make again. Hubby loved it!

We use the shredded Italian blend instead of straight mozzarella, as we prefer the flavor.

Easy recipe. Loved the red peppers and cheese. Had to cook them longer because Chicken breasts were a little thicker.  Tastes great.

Easy. Quick. Delicious. This is a great way of preparing chicken so full of flavor, everyone loved it. My only tweek was using more cheese and next time I will use smaller chiken breasts as 3 of them took up the entire sheet pan. I served it with a spring mix salad and mashed potatoes.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  We didn't care for the roasted red peppers.  The peppers seemed to over whelm any other flavors.  It did look pretty,but we didn't care for the taste.

This is my go-to recipe for special occasions. I use sliced mozzarella because it was what I had on hand the first time I fixed this dish, and it stays put better than the grated. I sprinkle the Italian seasoning on both sides of the meat before I pound it flat, so the flavor goes all the way through.

It was really good! I used shredded parmesan cheese in place of the grated and followed the recipe from there. Next time I'll throw some mozzarella on top after broiling to get a bit more of that flavor. My 2 year old and spouse loved it. Was easy to prepare. Def making again!

Made it exactly as the recipe called for. Very tasty but the reality is most of the cheese melted out of the chicken and ended up on the pan...

The family loved it!  After seasoning the chicken with garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, I omitted the red pepper and put in cheddar cheese, strips of salami and fresh spinach and then rolled up the chicken.  I didn't broil it but baked it for 35 min uncovered, and it turned out juicy and tender. Don't forget the olive oil drizzle before baking.

I will definitely make this again! My daughter who loves real chickens, so she tries to stay away from eating chicken, asked me to add this to our regular meal rotation! I only had parm & romano grated so I used that and I didn't have chives on hand so I subbed almost a TBS of onion powder with some parsley and it was fantastic! I used the cheese herb mix on the inside and out, it was great!

I followed the recipe for the ingredients, but instead of rolling, after I butterflied and flattened the breast I put the rest of ingredients on one side and then folded the other side over and secured it with toothpicks. I baked it at 400* for about 30 minutes and it came out great. I sliced it and my daughter and S-I-L (who is kind of a picky eater) both had two helpings and my daughter is taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was very tasty. I do have a bad habit of altering recipes...sorry, no offense. I added dried basil and garlic powder to the chicken, then put homemade  pasta sauce on the bottom of the dish and put the chicken on top, then drizzled more  sauce over the top. Sprinkled a little more mozzarella cheese on top before broiling. Very yummy

The family really liked this.  We didn’t have Italian seasoning but we did have oregano, basil, thyme, and crushed red pepper which worked just as well I think.  I also wasn’t precise with the amounts but just sprinkled the toppings and seasonings until it looked about right.

I followed recipe exactly but the recommended cooking times were insufficient.  I pounded the chicken breast thin.  Add 5 minutes to the recommended bake time and the broil 8 to 10 minutes.  It was a very delicious dish!

Did not turn out well for me was uncooked and no color to it. I then covered and cooked at 350 for 20 min and it was dry and pretty tasteless. Edible but not good. Followed the recipe except I roasted my own red peppers but it didn’t turn out good.

Add some red wine, a tbsp tomato paste and a handful of walnuts and you will have the Hibernia Diner's Chicken Walentino (Hibernia, NJ. Take Hibernia exit off I-80, left at the bottom of the ramp)  The diner by which I judge all others.

Pretty good, but would put some cheese on the top when broiling those last few minutes. Will make again if hubby is fixing or at least the pounding of the chicken & rolling it up.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. The chicken was dry and almost flavorless.  After thinking about what was missing in this recipe, I believe it was not browning the chicken after stuffing but before putting it in the oven.  Most chicken recipes that do not brown chicken breasts are cooked in a sauce. The white meat in a breast is very lean and needs "somthing" to keep it most.  I will not be making it again.

Made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great, everyone liked it. The prep isn't all that bad and the taste is worth the effort anyway. I added some sliced deli ham to the inside and rubbed minced garlic with oil on the outside of the chicken. I will definitely be making this again with some other variations mentioned in other comments.

Simple and tasty. I used green onions instead of chives because my chives had gone off, and garlic salt on top. We loved this with pasta and marinara, with fresh grated parm over all.

This recipe was fairly good, but it's missing something... something in the stuffing next to the roasted red bell pepper (like pesto, or panceta)... it was okay, but I'm sorry to say it fell short of my expectations.

Loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was not using canned red peppers. I roasted 1 fresh red bell pepper over a flame then sliced it.

Notes to myself : Don't be afraid to pound it thinner. If you can't find roasted red peppers, don't use a sauce replacement. Use more cheese overall. It's good topped with the garlic, red pepper, and rosemary suggestion. Side of Italian couscous with the leftover olive oil drizzled over it is good!

This chicken is very good, and looks fancy. When sliced for serving, however, the slices fell apart (thus the reduction of one star). Perhaps adding more cheese would do the trick. I used green onions instead of chives. Also, sprinkle with spices to add color and texture (I used crushed pepper, oregano,  ground cumin, and coarse sea salt ). I will definitely make this chicken again!

Great tasting and easy to make. I separated the chicken breast so as to have smaller portions. Tasted even better the next day as my lunch at work. Will make this again for sure. Everyone loved it.

Oh, WOW  I Would rate it 10 stars if I could, this came out like you would and should expect in a upscale Italian Restaurant. Only change was an add sliced mozzarella on top before rolling the chicken and with 5 minutes remaining on the broiling phase a slice of Mozzarella on top.

This dish was delicious. I did add my own sauce to it though: in a sauce pan I heated up some heavy cream, a little butter and some grated pecorino Romano parmigiana cheese and poured it over the chicken. Was very delicious.

I made some changes to the original recipe.  I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella.  I also rolled it in seasoned panko and browned it before putting in the oven.  The peppers and goat cheese together was amazing.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I used chicken thighs because, well, they were on sale and I forgot to add the Italian seasoning, but even with my variations the dish was very good.  I served it with cauliflower rice and my family really enjoyed it.  The crispy pieces on two were fantastic.  I will for sure make this again, but this time use breast.

So good. It is just perfect. I put olive oil, parm and panko on the outside and a thin slice of mozz on the top a few minutes before it was done. 2 whole boned chicken breast pounded, salted and peppered generously. Chives, fresh basil leaves, olive oil and parm smear covered with red jarred peppers, Mozz and spinch, salted. Fold over and toothpick.  25minutes in a gas oven plus 4 minutes with broiler on. Let sit covered for 5minutes.Superb. Plated and put juices in top. Easy and delicious.

This is an excellent easy recipe.  All the basics are there.  I was a little skeptical that this would be too dry and needed a sauce.  After reading other reviews the only change I made was brushing on Italian dressing on the chicken breasts.  (I used tenders) then added the roasted pepper, asparagus, cheese and then rolled.  Topped with cheese and drizzled the top with just a little Italian dressing.  Put in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  I didn't broil.  This was delicious and moist.  Husband loved it and it is an attractive looking dish.   The cheeses I used were pepper jack inside and the topping I used pecorino Romano.  This is what I had on hand.  You can really use just about any cheese that you like.  Try this one.  So easy and so good.

Made it tonight. Baked 15, broiled 5, took out and added a little mozzarella and parm cheese to the top, broiled until cheese browns- about 4 minutes. I sautéed fresh red pepper slices and diced onion with EVOO and a couple of drops of Liquid Smoke as I did not have chives or roasted red pepper. Also added a little chopped bacon. If I would've had it on hand I would have added spinach. Used a little Italian dressing on the tops in place of olive oil. The beauty of this recipe is that the possibilities are endless!

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner and was disappointed that it didn't live up to my expectations.  I couldn't convince anyone to eat the last piece.  It's just too much work for the result.

While we enjoyed this recipe, we felt it was lacking in flavor.  I think next time I'll add some fresh minced garlic, spinach and wrap them in bacon.

For a VERY beginner cook, I followed the suggestion of others and marinated chicken breast...  was delicious.  I do suggest to make sure you have bell pepper in each bite as the flavors are great together!   Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I feel bad giving it only 3 stars but it just didn't impress me.  IMHO, needed a sauce or something... but... who knows what I might've done wrong.  Seems like the components were there but it just didn't come together, taste-wise, for me.

This was fabulous, but instead of the Italian seasoning, I used fresh snipped herbs.  Oregano, Thyme, Rosemary, garlic, and basil.  I layerd the fresh herbs inside with the cheese and red pepper.  Then brushed the outiside lightly with the oil and remaining herbs.  I also grilled and it was supberb!

I used chicken breast strips tenderloins instead of hammering it out. Which means I didn't roll it up. I breaded the chicken, laid it in the glass dish, and then put the peppers and cheese ontop. It was pretty good and very easy!

I took the general idea of this recipe and adapted it to my husband's taste. However, it still wasn't a hit. Jeremy's comment was "too much meat, not enough of the vegetables (I stuffed mine with bellpeppers, mushrooms, onions, cheese and pepperoni)" who ever thought my guy would ask for more vegetables.

Wonderful chicken dish. The roasted red peppers really make every bite a treat. I think I may try and marinate the chicken next time to add some additional subtle flavor, and perhaps take the advice of others and add some garlic. We used freeze dried chives instead of fresh, and it seemed to be a bit too much chives. They claim to measure the same, but most of them ended up on the baking dish. Not the fault of the recipe.

This was pretty good. Made two stuffed chicken breasts for my bf and I tonight. He LOVED every bite! I guess I am not as much a fan of roasted peppers as I thought I was (which is the main reason for me not giving this a higher rating). I like roasted red peppers in some things, so I am not sure why I didn't care for them here.... I was chatting on the phone while pounding my chicken, and by accident, pounded them too thin (ikes!)!!! I was unable to roll as directed (kept falling apart... lol), but was able to gently fold over. I pretty much followed Crumpet's directions to the letter, but did substitute sliced fresh buffalo mozzarella (I purchased a medium-sized "ball" of it at my local Italian grocer) for the shredded stuff. I also added ~ 1/4 t of minced jarred garlic to each breast. I covered everything with Classico brand roasted red pepper alfredo sauce. I was surprised that my bf liked the sauce.... He hates cream and milk, two of the main ingredients! As naples34102 did, I too baked my chicken in a 400 degree oven. It took all of 20 minutes to cook through. Served with a boxed alfredo risotto mix, steamed asparagus, garlic bread and sparkling champagne, this made for a nice dinner. It also allowed me to use up items in my pantry/fridge that would go to waste otherwise. Thanks for sharing your idea Crumpet. My bf REALLY thanks you :)

This chicken was pretty good, but not outstanding by any means. I did add some portobello mushroom to the middle and added garlic powder, red pepper flakes, rosemary and basil to the dry mixture. I will try it again and will add a little more mushroom and moz next time.

I am rating the technique of this recipe. It really worked well and even a novice can do it. I was searching for ideas to do a stuffed chicken breast to use what I had on hand for leftovers.  I butterflied the breasts and then released my frustration on them with a mallet until they were the desired thickness.  Then I marinated them for a couple of hours to give them more flavor and moisture.  Patted them dry and seasoned and filled them. The filling I used was leftovers from a veggie fajita I ordered the previous night at a Mexican place.  Roasted veggies: onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, and wilted fresh spinach.  I sprinkled the veggie layer with about a tablespoon of feta and rolled up.  Placed on a pan and set in my pre-heated (set to broil) toaster oven. Just before removing (after they were browned) I topped with more cheeses and fresh herbs. 20 minutes later we were feasting. 2 quick and easy stuffed chicken breasts that are fairly healthy AND I got to use up my leftovers.  This technique is quick and easy and sooooo versatile - you can fill with anything you love.  Next time I am going to try the actual ingredients in the recipe.  Do try this recipe even if you do need to modify it based on what you have on hand.  Thanks for the last minute save!  Yum!

This was very good, just a tiny bit heavy on the Italian seasoning.  I used 2 large chicken breasts, slicing them in half laterally.  The servings were small, but adequate, and the ratio of filling to chicken was perfect.

We don't care for as much seasoning, so I leave it out and add a dash of Johnny's, it's quite tasty!

This was very good!  I do agree that it needs a little more flavor (and cheese!)--I added garlic, spinich, and lots of seasoning, but I feel it could have used something more.  I think I will add Italian dressing next time as others have suggested.

This was good. I roasted my own red bell peppers, which cut down the cost a little. The meat didn't look quite done when it was finished, so I left it in there a couple of minutes longer. It was good!

Great recipe made even better with few modifications: I made this recipe and also added some sliced (pre-marinated) artichoke hearts alongside the roasted red peppers. Also another suggestion is to spread a layer of herb cheese (I used Boursin) instead of the mozzerella as the boursin adds a bolder taste and greater flavor than the weak mozzerella.

This turned out very good. But because I had read previous reviews I made a lot of the italian seasoning mixture, added a little to the inside of the chicken with the peppers and cheese. and also once the chicken was rolled up, I rolled them in the seasoning mixture so it covered the outside of the breasts, I think this gave it a lot more flavor. I also broiled a little mozzarella cheese on the tops. Then baked at 350F for about 25 mins and it was done.

This chicken is SO good. My husband requests it every week (right after i'm done requesting him to make me a shepards pie). We leave out the chives usually, and it's just as yummy. Also, i tend to add pepper both on the inner half and the outer half of the chicken, and more cheese than recommended

i made this recipe with some alterations. i used pepperjack cheese instead of mozzarella and took the advice of some others by sprinkling red pepper flakes on the top. it really needed the alfredo sauce on the noodles to add some flavor though.

This was great. I made mine with sun dried tomato because that's what I had. I served it over bow tie pasta with sundried tomato alfredo, halved grape tomatos, and I put the chives in the pasta because I forgot to use it when the recipe called for it. It turned out wonderfully though. Enjoy, I did!

this was great! will be making this quite often. did make a few changes. i marinated the chicken in a basalamic/olive oil/garlic combo for about 15-20 minutes, and skipped the chives, because i didn't have any. i did add the pancetta, as others had done and it really added another layer of flavor. oh, and when i rolled everything up, i blotted the excess marinade from the chicken or it's too slippery. also added some extra parmesan to the tops of the rolls when i took them out of the oven. they're still warm enough that i melts, and is gooey. great dish!

I was really excited about this recipe, but I was disappointed with the outcome.  The flavor was really bland.  I used mozzarella di bufala, and threw in the rest of the jar of peppers around the chicken.  Good thing, because we needed the extra peppers just to add some flavor to the dish.  I also sprinkled the cheese/chive mixture over the top of the chicken after rolling them up, but it was still just rather tasteless.  I won't be making this again.

I thought this looked really great, but I have to admit I was disappointed with the taste.  While the chicken was moist, I felt like it needed more flavor.  Serving some sort of cream sauce along with this is one idea.  Playing with the seasonings and fillings is one other.  For now, I think I'll just experiment with other chicken dishes out there.

Very good recipe!  I used marinated sweet peppers instead of the roasted and it added an interesting twist of flavors that I thought complimented each other quite well.  I also added proscuitto to the stuffing and it really did seem restaurant quality!

I served this to some friends, (since it was a "new" recipe, they were to critique it)....and we ALL thought it was a definite winner.  We all appreciated the variety of flavors...!  

My only issue seems to be that my chicken-rolling has always resulted in such a sloppy looking "roll" that I am usually unwilling to make those recipes for company meals.  So next time I will use the previous reviewer's idea of wrapping it in the phyllo-dough....

Thanks for the super recipe Crumpet!

As a beginner i have to say this is very easy and it tasted great.  My brother, a very picky eater, even liked this dish.  Everything was good except I felt something was missing that may of been my fault on not knowing how much salt and pepper to add (As i said i am a beginner).  Other than that its a dish i will be trying again :)
