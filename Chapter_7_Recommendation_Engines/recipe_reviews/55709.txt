Delicious! It is a #1 hit--restaurant quality flavor. I love this soup!  I take it to family gatherings and they love it too!  They always ask me if I'm going to bring this soup. If you like more "substance" you may add one or two more corn tortillas to it.  I don't really like adding chicken unless I have chicken tenders.  Cooked chicken would work fine too.  It just seems if you throw in raw chicken to boil, the chicken tastes bland.  I like to serve it with corn tortilla chips--it is somewhat thick enough to dip into.  Also, we don't care too much for a lot of cheese or avacados--the soup is great as is.

I think this soup had great flavor. Kid friendly. (Not too spicy.) I used leftover cooked chicken. I also added a can of corn.If you are looking for something inbetween a tomato base and chicken base this recipe is for you.

If you've ever been to an Islands restaurant you'll know what to expect. Very good and easy to make. I added a 4oz can of Salsa Verde for an extra kick.

This was an excellent soup!  I only used 7 tortillas instead of 10 and added some chopped carrots, celery and fresh parsley.  I also put a dollup of sour cream on each serving.  Very good!

Yum! Loved this soup. Quick, easy, tastes great. It has the flavors of the enchiladas I make, but without all the cheese, so I'm sure it's better for me. Love the cilantro, too. Highly recommended.

WOW!!  I must say this was a wonderful and easy recipe.  I had never made tortilla soup before and was sooo pleased with the results.  The avocado and cilantro made the soup, and I'm not even a huge fan of cilantro!  I also added one fresh jalepe√±o which added some more spice.  Other than that I didn't change a thing, it was perfect as is!

Very quick, easy, delicious soup! I used diced tomatoes with jalapenos, which probably made it just a little spicier.
Just a few tips: Make sure you cut the tortilla strips THIN (recipe says 1/8th inch). This is important for them to dissolve properly. Some of mine were a little thick.
Also, do not skip the cilantro. It adds a lot to this soup!

This is very good as is.  I made it ahead of time and refrigerated it until ready to eat.

I made this in my crock pot and cooked on low about 6-8 hours. Instead of slicing the avocado, I made guacamole with fresh Italian flat leaf parseley since my husband doesn't like cilantro,and put a dollop in the soup before serving. Great recipe! Will make this again.

This is a great recipe! I've been making it for a couple of years now, and I added a little bit of my sister's recipe to it also. I added some carrots, zucchini and yellow squash. Instead of using cheddar cheese we use jack cheese. Very good, I highly recommend this recipe to everyone that likes soup!

This soups is WONDERFUL!  I made this for my husband and a friend while watching football, paired it with a 7 layer dip and it was a huge hit!  I added more garlic and added salsa verde, as recommended by others.  A keeper for sure!

Very tasty soup however also very spicy.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis already in them.  I recommend a dollup of sour cream!

Sorry, but my soup was a big disappointment.  I was really looking forward to a new soup recipe, but this one seemed bitter, despite having so many of my favorite ingredients.  Guess I'll keep trying!
