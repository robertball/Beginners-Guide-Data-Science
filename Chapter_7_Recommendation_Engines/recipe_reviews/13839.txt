I just tried these tonight and pulled them out of the oven not two minutes ago, and they're perfect. My first attempt at pumpkin seeds last year ended in disaster. Thankfully, the good folks at allrecipes.com make it so I can rely on other cooks' experience and suggestions to make sure that doesn't happen again.

After reading the reviews, I doubled everything except the Worcestershire for the 2 1/2 cups of seeds I had, substituting seasoned salt for regular salt, and baked them at 300 for an hour, plus 8 more minutes for that extra crunch. I did use Parkay butter spray and sprinkle on Parmesan for that last 8 minutes. They're the perfect texture and taste. I'm putting this one in my recipe box. Thanks for a great recipe, Carolyn, and thanks to everyone else for their comments that helped me make such a great snack!

I make this recipe myself but substitute the butter with olive oil which is healthier and doesn't burn.
Very yummy!

I roast pumpkin seeds on a regular basis, and I always use this recipe now that I have found it. I must warn you: the more spice mixture you use, the better they are! The perfect balance for me is actually quadruple the mixture and still 2 cups of seeds. Also, for the salt I use 1/3 regular salt and the rest seasoned salt and they are soooooooo good! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed someone's advice and quadrupled the amount of seasoning but kept the 2C pumpkin seeds. It turned out great! I ended up taking them to my son's teacher the next day just so I'd stop munching on them. My son said his preschool class enjoyed them too. The only other change is that I soak my seeds in salt water overnight, because that's what my mom always did.

These were unbelievable... really!!! I've never tried pumpkin seeds before, but after tasting these, I was hooked. They were crunchy and delicious right out of the oven... but JUST as crunchy and delicious the next day... and the day after that! The flavor reminded me a little of the original check mix... absolutely amazing! If you have any reservations about trying these... don't. Trust me, there is no possible way you won't like them.

This was easy to make and the flavor was good but I guess it is just a texture thing with me. I don't care for the way they chew up. It is like eating sunflower seed shells. My family thought they were ok. By the way an easy way to clean out a pumpkin is with a metal Ice Cream Scoop.

These were good. Careful with how much margarine you use....too much makes them soggy.

Great flavor! My husband swore he wouldn't eat them until he started to smell them cooking and ending up LOVING them!  I soaked the seeds in warm water as I cleaned out the pumpkins, it  seems easier to separate and clean the seeds this way.

Learn from my mistake! I followed all of the suggestions to boil and then dry them for 24 hours. Watch them carefully because mine burned very quickly. I'm sure it's obvious to most, but the hour of cooking is only if they are fresh out of the pumpkin! The house smells like burnt popcorn!

My daughter had been bugging me for DAYS to make pumpkin seeds, so I found the recipe and tried it.  GREAT!  I added a little seasoned salt.  Also, I had to bake them longer--about an hour--until they dried properly.

Great recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine and they were great.  I omitted the salt.  I read where a lot of people like to soak their seeds then let them dry overnight... I don't do this.  I boil the seeds in water for about 35 min. I then pat dry and season them.  I immediately bake them starting at 200 degrees then when they look fairly dry I turn up the heat to 275 - 300 deg. and take them out when they are a golden brown.  It takes longer but I have had bad luck with my seeds burning when allowing them to dry out before baking.  This way my seeds always turn out perfect in the middle.  They are never wet.

As far as pumpkin seeds go, these are pretty good.  I used 2.5 cups of seeds and 1.5 teaspoons of W. sauce.  For the reviewers that had problems with overly moist seeds, make sure your seeds are spread out in a single layer on your baking sheet (I used a cookie sheet).  Mine weren't spread out enough at first, and weren't browning at all.  I put them on two cookies sheets instead of one, and it worked like a charm.  I liked how the W. sauce turned the seeds a nice golden brown color.

This was so good.  I also used seasoning salt and just the garlic powder and no salt caause it already had enough salt.  Boy did it come out great.  I trend to use other ingredients from other recipes that are the same but with some different ingredients that I think will mix and taste well for me and boy did it.  My husband at first thought it was going to taste bad but after it was made loved it too.

Great recipe with no alterations made.  To remove the pumpkin slime from the seeds I boiled the seeds in salt water for about 10 minutes.  The pumpkin will separate from the seeds very easily this way.

I have been making these seeds for years and they are best warm out of the oven.

I have my own special process for preparing the seeds because they should be dry before roasting, if they are still wet they will just steam.

Clean your seads well, I find a colander words great, and let them drain overnight in the colander.  The next morning spread them out on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Let them sit for a few hours, then pour them off of the cookie sheet, and replace the foil, you will find that the foil was wet.  Spread the seeds out again of a fresh sheet of foil and let them finish drying for a few more hours.  They are finally ready to toss and roast.

I always make toasted seed whenever I cook a whole pumpkin. Today I cut up an acorn squash so I tried the seeds with this recipe. This was a nice change but I thought something was lacking. I added a pinch of paprika and it improved the flavor a lot. 
When I use raw seeds, I microwave them for two minutes to partially dry them up. Otherwise it takes too long to toast raw seeds.

I have not met anyone who doesn't love this recipe.  Even I can't stop eating them and I don't care for pumpkin seeds.  I double or quadruple the sauce depending on my mood and who I am making it for however.  Its a great way to use all the seeds we pull from pumpkins when making pumpkin pie or jack-o-lanterns and a perfect gift for friends.  Put your seeds in cold water for a few hours before trying to separate them then separate in the water and it should make it easier.

Because of this recipe I don't dread the annual pumpkin seed bake anymore! They come out great every time, and everyone loves them. The recipe as posted is perfect, but to mix it up a bit I replaced the salt & garlic salt with Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning which gave them a big kick. Kids didn't like that batch, but the adults sure did. Either way, wonderful recipe! Thanks.

I doubled the sauce for only about 1.5c of pumpkin seeds.  Used butter, subbed garlic powder for garlic salt, & delicious Lea & Perrins Worcestershire, from Canada; it's WAY more flavorful than the kind they sell in the US!  Baked them on a foil-covered jellyroll pan, stirring about every 15 minutes, for a total of about 75-90 minutes.  They came out crisp and full of great flavor!  Thanks for the recipe, Carolyn!

Enjoyed this recipe.  Added garlic power instead of garlic salt, then added parmesan at the end for the saltiness.  Was sad after Halloween when I could not find any marked down pumpkinds.

So good! This recipe is very tasty. I followed other reviews and doubled the spices. I would suggest to all who do any kind of roasting with pumpkin seeds to leave the snot like stuff on them, do not rinse or boil the entire pumpkin flavor off. The first time I roasted pumpkin seeds I rinsed the seeds a couple of times and the result was something that tasted like flavored cardboard.

Finally, a snack that is delicious, and good for you too! We always save the seeds from our Jack 'O lantern pumpkins around Halloween and make so many batches of these...the signature dish that makes my boyfriend bring all of his friends around in the fall months. What a great way to use everything up! Thanks for sharing :)

These came out quite well; since I like a little more taste, I added more garlic salt and also some onion salt. I have a gas oven, so I decreased the temperature to 250 degrees and cooked them for one hour and 15 minutes in a stoneware bar pan, stirring about every 10 to 15 minutes. The seeds are not greasy or burnt.

SOOOOO good!  Used garlic powder because I didn't have garlic salt.  Doubled the dry ingredients like many others suggested.  Also baked for 60 minutes at 300 like others suggested.

Very, very good. I've been using this recipe for years. Be careful, though. These are addictive! TIP: I use garlic powder and sea salt. You don't need a whole ton of salt, just enough for flavor as the worchestershire has plenty.

This recipe serves as an excellent base and can be tinkered with to suite individual tastes.  The proportion of ingredients is perfect.  I had 2 1/4 cup seeds so adjusted accordingly.  Used Lawry's season salt, real butter, and garlic powder.  I toasted the seeds plain for about 20 minutes turning once just to dry them out a bit so they would be nice and crunchy.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe with a little zip!  Waste not, want not for a healthy, tasty snack.

WOW!!  These are AWSOME!!  I decided to do something different with the pumpkin seeds this year. I stumbled across this recipe and my kids can't stop eating them!! After looking at the ingredients, I didn't think they would be that great, but I was so wrong!! I soaked them for about an hour in a bowl of water, just to clean them off. Then I just drained them. I also used butter instead of margerine, and I baked them at 350 for a half hour, stirring them only once, and they came out great! They also fill the house with a fantastic aroma! I will be using this recipe for now on!!

YUMMMM! I had just a little garlic salt left, so I'd sprinkle it on when I did the stirring every 20 min. of the baking.  My husband thought it was on the salty side, but I can't stop eating them!

I like to double the seasonings.  I also soak the seeds in salt water for a while, then try to dry the seeds out as much as I can.  Yum!  The kids just devour these.  Bought extra pumpkins from the patch just for seeds!!

Excellent! I use real butter and a lot more Worcestershire and salt throughout the cooking process. I don't rinse or soak my seeds as I LOVE the pulp mixed in. I must buy another pumpkin tomorrow to roast more seeds. Didn't have garlic salt on hand but am sure that would be just as nice and will try it next time.

First time making these.  They tasted pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did boil the seeds in salt water and dried them before baking them.  Would follow other reviewers suggestions and add a bit more seasoning.  A lot of work for not a lot of product but it just makes you appreciate them more :)  Thanks to Carolyn for posting this recipe.  Happy Halloween!

Excellent! Did it with some of the alterations that other people have mentioned - 3 tbsp canola oil, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic, and kept the rest as is. It was delicious!! I love it. It was a big hit when I brought it into work.

I do not understand how certain recipes get rave reviews... we are not picky eaters.  My family did not care for these at all.  I ended up washing off the seasoning using a strainer and then laid them out to dry.  Then we ate them.  I will stick to my traditional method of boiling in salt water then roasting.  Call me frugal, but I went to a lot of work  scrape'n them seeds outta that pumpky...by the way, using worcestershire sauce, margarine, and salt does not make this a healthy selection.

These are really good! I did make one minor change though...I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since so many review said they were too salty. Turned out perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent flavor and the perfect crunch.
Just be sure they are dry before baking,or you'll have to bake them longer.  Great recipe!
The one person gave this only one star (pulling down this rating) and said they "even microwaved them to be sure they were dry before baking".
Then they mentioned the flavor was good, but the consistency was terrible.
Umm.. yeah.. when you microwave them you can't really blame the recipe.. the microwave killed the consistency.

This recipe was very good. I took some of the others advice and doubled the recipe. I rinsed the seeds very well and patted them dry and stuck them in the oven for 20 minutes before using this recipe. It made them crunchier. I used extra-virgin olive oil instead of butter; I did not double the oil though. I also used popcorn salt, just because I thought it would coat all the seeds better. They turned out very good. I have a picky 5 year old and he loved them.

My husband and I grow the Sugar Pie pumpkins. We ended up with about 20 pumpkins this year so we looked for a seed recipe. This is the BEST seed recipe ever! The butter and worchestishire sauce really make this recipe. We had about 16 cups of seed we baked up and stored in Food Saver bags. Great snack and gift!

Hope everyone had a wonderful Halloween! I fried these little guys with some olive oil first and then put them in the oven along with a bit cayenne for a little kick. My moronic hubby, who went out last night dressed as a "brain donor" (hospital scrubs, "bloodied" gauze wrapped around his head, blood dripping down his face, blackened eyes and carried a jar of cauliflower) thought they were perfect. Our totally mortified daughters thought they were great too! Thanks!!

I loved the flavor of these seeds.  They tasted great even for people who aren't a fan of pumpkin seeds.  They are easy to make, but do take a little bit of extra cooking time.

After carving pumpkins, we had a ton of raw pumpkin seeds, so I decided to give this recipe a try. They're a great, crunchy, tasty little snack! I'm only giving them 4 stars though because I did make some modifications after reading the reviews, and I think they would probably have turned out a bit bland if I'd made the recipe as written. To summarize my modifications:
-After reading up on roasting pumpkin seeds, I decided to take the advice to soak the seeds in salt water overnight before roasting.
-I used olive oil instead of butter.
-I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.
-I quadrupled the spices
-I added a little black pepper (personal preference--my boyfriend likes pepper on EVERYTHING)
I had to add ten or fifteen extra minutes onto the bake time (maybe because of the soaking?) but after that they turned out great and highly addictive!

This recipe should be called "Chex Mix Pumpkin Seeds".  Seriously tastes exactly like homemade Chex Mix spices,  I like Chex Mix seasoning, but it wasn't a good mix with pumpkin seeds in my opinion.  Or maybe it just made me want Chex Mix instead? Lol. Either way, won't be making this one again.

Nice changeup to just roasting seeds. Didn't change 1 thing.  Everyone that tried these was like "oh, I like pumpkin seeds..." then would grab a handful and say "wow, those are REALLY good! What's on them?!" Will CERTAINLY make again!

I found that it needed more spices, so I kept adding a bit more garlic and Worcestershire sauce as it was baking. It came out beautifully in the end!

After carving a few pumpkins, I separated the seeds and threw this recipe together. The recipe itself was easy to make. I did everything per the recipe, increasing the ingredients to make 3 cups of seeds. I ended up having to bake the seeds a little longer than the recipe called for, but that wasn't too big of a deal. Unfortunately, the end result was a bit bland for my taste. I've read a few other reviews that suggested doubling the dry ingredients and I would probably recommend this as well. Overall, this recipe was a good place to start, but still needed more to make it great.

Used garlic powder instead of salt and a good sprinkle of seasoning salt on top. Turned the oven off after an hour, but left them in to crisp. C'est magnifique!

This is my first time making seeds -I never have enough seeds but this year we carved 6 pumpkins!  I made this subbing olive oil for margarine and used Lawry's Seasoned Salt (for the regular salt) and my husband liked the flavor but asked if I had salted them.  The next batch I doubled the seasoned salt and garlic salt.  I baked them 1 hr 5 min and he loved them!  Thanks!

OMG! Cannot stop eating these!  I took suggestions and used olive oil and doubled the recipe (but probably had less than 2 cups of seeds). Fantastic!

This is a better way to add some "oomph" to roasted pumpkin seeds.  I used whatever seeds I had on hand (delicata, buttenut).  I melted the butter, then mixed in the balsamic, salt, and garlic granules.  Then tossed it all together with the seeds before spreading them out on an aluminium-lined (sprayed) cookie tray.  Cooked them for the requisite time, and 'voila' - they were perfect!

We make these every year, and love them.  I had about 3 cups of seeds, which I washed really well, then dried them.  If you leave them too wet, the mixture won't stick to the seeds very well (the whole oil doesn't mix with water thing).  I adjusted the ingredients a bit because I had more seeds than the recipe called for.  I used the same amount of butter, but added about 2 tsp of olive oil.  I used 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of Lawry's season salt, and 1 tsp of garlic powder (didn't have any garlic salt on hand).  I doubled the worcestershire.  Yumm-o!

After reading some other reviews, I made the following adjustments:  Quadrupled the sauce with the same amount of seeds, used seasoned salt in lieu of regular salt AND added 1 TBS maple syrup.  The syrup added just enough sweet to the mix while the saltiness was still prevalent.  Amazing!

Perhaps it was my oven, but the cook time wasn't quite long enough. I baked them at least 20 minutes longer, checking every so often. I also thought they were a bit bland, so I added extra garlic salt and Lawrey's Season Salt. Then they were very good!

These were very good.  Maybe a little salty.  Next time I'll probably use a bit less.  But the worcestershire really brings an interesting and pleasant flavor to these seeds!

Loved this recipe!! I also used olive oil AND butter flavored cooking spray. I had a lot of seeds so made two batches and added 1 tsp of lite soy sauce and 1 tsp of steak sauce since I was out of steak seasonings. Double the spices and we cooked at 300 - made for happy kids and happy momma.  Now to try not to hide them from the kids.

Pretty good.  I haven't made pumpkin seeds before, and this was relatively easy.  I changed the spices based on other reviews.  I had a little less than 2 cups of seeds and added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 3 Tbsp butter and 2 tsp of worcestershire.  I stirred every 15 minutes as recommended by other reviewers.  I cooked on a foil lined baking sheet for easy clean up.  Mine only took about 50 minutes at 300 to get golden brown.

Tasty and quick snack.  My son loved these; He always asks for the seeds when we carve our jack-o-lanterns.  These came out much better than expected.  The little bit of margarine had the spices and salt clinging on rather than falling off in the bottom of the bowl they're served in.  Be sure to spread them out on the cookie sheet and stir every now and again.  Mine took slightly longer than an hour.  Enjoy!

Wow!  First time I've ever baked a pumpkin today as well as made use of the seeds!  Holy cow was this yummy!  I took the suggestion of baking the seeds for 1 hour at 300, then adding grated parmesan cheese and baked 8 minutes more.  Dang are these good!  Rating . . 5 stars plus some . . .

Wonderful recipe starter. Four stars only because I did make some changes by reading through the other reviews. I used butter rather than margarine and doubled the amount, used lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular salt and doubled it, used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and doubled it (actually probably a bit more), kept worcestershire the same and had about 2.5 cups of seeds. I also added in some parmesan cheese sprinkles near th end for some yummy flavor and texture.   These took me forever to cook since my seeds were a bit wet from sitting overnight in the fridge but I just kept stirring @ 300 degrees every 20 minutes until they were golden brown and lightly crunchy. I usually lightly sprinked a bit more seasoned salt, garlic powder and/or parm during each stirring session as well. Soooo delicious. If you love chex mix you'll love this pumpkin seed recipe! This is what I'll be using from now on!

I tried these 3 different times, and they just didn't turn out good. Easier and cheaper to just buy the store-bought.

I baked the seeds for my first time tonight. I doubled the recipe as some reviews recommended. I am not too nuts about the taste. It was wicked salty so next time I'll go light on the salt. I baked them at 300 for about 70 mins-a little too long.

I didn't have any garlic salt for some reason (?!), so I used some garlic powder and a little extra salt. They turned out pretty well. They did not take as long in the oven as the recipe said, though, so keep an eye on them!

These were great, but to make them more healthy I used Olive Oil in place of the margarine and cooked until very crunchy. Perfect consistency and taste!

This is the best flavor I have ever tasted on pumpkin seeds.  This is the recipe I'll keep.  I did have to make some minus the Worcestershire sauce because my 8 year old thought they were too spicy.

I've never fixed pumpkin seeds any other way other than olive oil and kosher salt. I am really glad I tried it this way. Very good. Reminds me of the seasonings for original homemade Chex Mix. My kids and even the picky boy next door are loving these.

Sooo good! Followed the recipie exactly with the exception of adding a sprinkle of paprika it the spice mixture. I also sprinkled the pan with grated parmesean in the last 8 minutes. My 5-year-old couldn't stop eating them!

The worsht sauce was too overpowering-I double the other seasonings but left that the same, glad I did they would have been ruined.  I'll make it next time with a different recipe without any worsht sauce.  If you aren't a big fan of the sauce, you probably won't care for these.

This is the best pumpkin seed recipe ever! I was reading the reviews to my non-pumpkin seed eating husband and he was laughing about how every recipe says "I converted my husband and now he loves this recipe." Well, he now is a believer! He was sneaking these seeds all night!

These pumpkin seeds were pretty good! I had to cook mine for a bit longer than an hour, more like an hour and a half. At about an hour, they were still a bit soggy, so at an hour I increased the temperature to 300 and cooked for about 30 minutes more. They came out pretty tasty.

For the optimal experience when cooking pumpkin seeds you must dry cleaned seeds overnight. Doing so on torn open brown paper bags is reccomended. Only then will you achieve a perfect crisp and crunchy seed. 

This recipe is perfect. I don't know how anyone could find any fault in it unless you just don't like pumpkin seeds.

Great recipe.  Put the seeds in the microwave for 2 minutes prior to baking to dry them out.  I've made seeds for years, but never tried this trick.  Wow, that worked great!!  I only baked the seeds for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.  Yummy!

These are so addictive!  I used other reviewer's suggestions and upped the seasoning on the seeds, and they were great.  I'm not sure about the accuracy of the temp/time on the recipe - I think you just have to watch them closely and figure out your own oven.

This was a great recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted garlic powder for garlic salt. I also used a little bit less ingredients as I only had 1 1/2 cups of seeds.  My husband raved about them and almost ate the whole bowl before dinner!  Thanks!

Very good, I took some of the previous comments & doubled all the spices, made it a bit to salty, so will cut that back.  Also used olive oil instead of margarine. 
Didn't have to bake as long as recipe indicated, only took 45 min for me, so keep an eye on it when you stir.

Interesting... tasted like pumpkin seeds in Worcestershire sauce and not much else.  Needs more seasoning and less Worcestershire.  I sprayed the baking sheet with cooking spray, and that made it a bit greasy; I had to dry the seeds on paper towels.  Also did not take nearly that long to cook.
I would recommend more seasoning, less Worcestershire and less cooking time.  This recipe is on the right track, but needs a little something more.

These were good. I would make them again. But like the other reviews suggest, you need to double or triple the amount of spice/sauce for it to really be tasty.

These were the best pumpkin seeds that I have ever made!  Thanks for the recipe!  I did add a few drops of red pepper sauce to the (real unsalted butter, not margarine).  I also used coarse salt instead of regular salt, along with the garlic salt.  I used onion powder as suggested by another reviewer. I used twice as much spice adn salt, if not three times as much as listed, but used just the recommened 2 tsp of worcestershire.  I had to leave them in the oven for about 1.5 hrs.  They turned out great.  My two year old son and husband loved them!  Can't wait till next year!

I made this exactly as written and was pleased with the flavor...just like I remember from when I was little!  I did soak the seeds in warm water right after removing from the pumpkin, then spread them out to dry overnight.  I baked them up this morning and they're almost gone!

Thank you for this recipe!  I have tried to make pumpkin seeds twice, both times we didn't care for them.  My daughter wanted to take pumpkin seeds to her Halloween party at school so I reluctantly looked up this recipe.  I put all the ingredients in a bowl bowl (had a bag of candy on reserve) and let it sit for about an hour.  I Baked them for longer then it called for (we wanted them crunchy).  We all loved them!  She took 25 sandwich bags to school and said everyone LOVED them.  If 25 4th graders like them, it's a keeper in my book!!!  I'm actually going to buy a pumpkin today (Nove. 1st) if I can find one, so my husband has a snack...he felt left out.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried for pumpkin seeds!  My husband and I both loved it.  I only made a few minor changes.  I added 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and baked them at 300 degrees for 45 minutes, stirring about every 13 minutes or so.  They turned out perfectly!

These turned out really nice.  I only had 1 3/4 cups of seeds and used the called for amounts of spices and they still turned out great (not overly salty).  I used 1/4tsp regular salt and 1/4 tsp seasoned salt and everything else as directed.  Thank you for the tasty treats.

What a great recipe!!  I love the smell as they bake, and I love the taste when they come out!!  I, personally, like my snacks with a lot of flavor, so I now double all the spices.  I also bake them on a baking stone stirring every 10-15 min. to prevent burning.  Crispy and tasty.  These are worth every bite!!

I thought the ingredients were a great grouping but I had problems with the baking time. It took me a lot longer. I baked at 275 for 1 hour and then at 300 on speed bake for 20 minutes more.

These are great! Not as strong as I thought they would be which is good. Just enough flavor without being overdone or too salty. I roast pumpkin seeds at 300 degrees and found for 2 cups a little more than an hour is good (this will vary somewhat for every batch). I also use olive oil instead of margarine and stir about every 15 minutes while baking. I will make these again but will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt (so they don't get too salty) and double the amount. They smelled really good while baking.

The flavor was awesome but a lot of the seeds wouldn't open and some wouldn't come out of the shell after opened. Maybe I undercooked them?

Simple to make and totally addictive!  The only problem with this recipe is you won't be able to stop eating it.  Hint: to make sure the seeds come out crispy and not chewy, you must dry them overnight after rinsing them.

Smells up the kitchen FANTASTICALLY! This is one of the reasons I wanted to carve pumpkins so badly this year! So easy to make... and so easy to eat the whole batch alone! The recipe calls for a shallow baking dish, but I prefer a cookie sheet (lined with foil, sides folded up) so the seeds can spread out and get crunchy. I made two batches: one sticking to the recipe, and one with about 1 tsp cayenne pepper for a little more spice. Both were fantastic.

A nice treat to make with the leftover pumpkin seeds.  Liked the flavor but think they needed to bake longer for more crispness.

I love pumpkin seeds and throw a carving party just to get the seeds ( just kidding) The flavor is really good with the worcestershire and garlic.Added a little red pepper flakes for kicks. I used 50/50 olive oil and melted butter but cut back on the total amount used or doubled the amt of seeds because it is just to oily otherwise. I like them a little dryer and also cooked them at 300. Makes the kitchen smell wonderful! and they are so good for you.

These are amazing! I doubled everything (except the seeds and Worcestershire sauce), substituted garlic salt for garlic powder, and added an extra 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Soooo good

Very good.  I only had 1 1/2 cups of seeds but I made the sauce exactly as written, it seemed like just enough, not sure if it would be enough if I had 2 coups of seeds.  I only baked 45 minutes I think 1 hour might be a bit long, it's best just to watch and test when stirring.  I'll be using this again.  Don't think I'd call then "spicy" pumpkin seeds though, they aren't spicy, I'd call them "Savory Pumpkin Seeds"

I wish I had ignored all of the people who told me to quadruple the recipe. WAY too salty and overpowering!!! Yikes! But I'm still going to eat them and probably will use the recipe again just with less of the "sauce". Thanks!!!

I usually just throw the seeds away, but I thought I would give this recipe a try. I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder  instead of garlic salt. The seeds turned out great.

You pretty much can't go wrong with these! First time, I tried it with everything (except worcestshire) tripled, that turned out great. 2nd time I just doubled everything (including worcestshire) and I brought that to Thanksgiving- not one seed left. Everyone was munching on em all night! Thanks for the recipe :)

I've made these twice so far. The first time my 2 yr old ate half the batch in one sitting while I wasn't looking. They are a great healthy snack. They taste almost like chex mix.

This recipe and its comments helped guide me to making some super delicious pumpkin seeds!  I had 3 cups of pumpkin seeds to work with.  So I used 3 Tbsp of olive oil, 2 Tsp of Lawry's Season Salt, 1 Tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of onion powder and 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I evenly coated two cookie sheets with the seeds and cooked them for 1 hr at 300 degrees, stirred them up after the hour was up, then put them back in for another 10 minutes.

These turned out really good; but in my oven I  would have cooked them only 45 min instead of the full hour.  Cooking them a hour had some of them burn a little even though I turned off the oven for the last 15 minutes.

These are outstanding! I boiled the seeds in salt water for a few minutes to get them really clean and then let them dry on a cookie sheet for about 24 hours. Then I followed other reviewer suggestions and added more spices. For my 2 C of pumpking seeds I used 3 TB butter, 3 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 3 tsp worcestershire. Husband loves them and this will now be our standard pumpkin seed recipe.

Used seasoned salt in place of the salt and garlic salt and stirred every 15 minutes - like making trash mix.  Drained on paper towels til cooled.  Great snack and good for you.

I tripled the ingredients and it was just a little too salty for our taste.  Next batch I will follow the directions just as they are and see how that works.

This recipe turned out great!  I made this the first few times using pumpkin seeds from small sugar pumpkins that I was using for cooking.  I enjoyed the flavours so much that I wanted to enjoy these all year round, so instead of using pumpkin seeds I tried making them with chickpeas instead and they were fabulous!  Kind of like a crunchy  "corn nut" type of snack with the same flavouring of the pumpkin seeds except made with chickpeas.  I used chickpeas that were originally dried, so I soaked them overnight and boiled them for an hour and a half before letting them cool.  Then I followed the pumpkin seed recipe exactly, but cooked the chickpeas at 350 degrees for 40 minuites.  Using canned chieckpeas may require longer cooking time.  For more info on roasting chickpeas check out the roasted chickpea recipe on this site, which is also wonderful, although I do like using this recipe better.

I've roasted pumpkins seeds year after year, attacted to them through nostalgia, disappointed by the reality that they just were not that good. These, however, we great! I soaked them in salted water overnight because I couldn't get to them the first day. Don't know if that made any difference or not.

UPDATE- the 3rd time I made these I only had 3/4 cup of seeds from a pie pumpkin. So I ended up having more than twice the amount of seasoning and butter. It came out awesome. I saw some other reviews where people recommended using two to four times the amount of seasoning called for. I can say I agree with that.

yummy!   used about 2 TBSP unsalted butter, omitted salt, used garlic powder, lawry's season salt, liquid smoke and a dash of cayenne pepper.  i used approx 2 1/2 - 3 cups organic raw pump. seeds and quadrupled seasoning.    very tasty!

Spiced Pumpkin Seeds - Very tasty. Keeper.  Adjustments: Took the advice of others and quadrupled the seasonings with the exception of the Worcestershire sauce and substituted salt for seasoning salt.  Cooked for an hour an 10 mins at 275 degrees for crunchiness

Followed the recipe to a T and was just not happy with the results.  I'm sorry.  I threw them away.  This is a highly rated and recommended recipe, so maybe give it a try anyway.  It was easy and cost nothing.  Maybe you'll have better luck.

Fantastic! Usually I just do a little salt and some EVOO on my seed. This recipe made them just incredible.

So the flavor of these is sort of like one of the flavors of corn nuts. I wanted to give it 4 stars but realized that it was my fault. I followed the advice of other reviewers and only doubled the mixture, far to overwhelming. Next time I'm going to keep the original recipe and i know they will be great because the flavors weren't off.

YUMMMY!

I added a lot more salt, because my boyfriend likes them salty. This is an easy treat. It's really hard to mess this one up. And the crunchier the better. Took them to work the following few days for a nice crunchy snack to get me through between meals!! Better than sunflower seeds in my opinion.

Ruined our pumpkin seeds this year with this recipe--waaay too salty and way too greasy.  What should be a dry, clean snack is a total mess.

Very good and a nice change from the way I usually roast the seeds. I think I might double the seasoning next time, but the flavouring is nice and subtle as written too. I also used a lot of garlic powder rather than garlic salt and added black pepper. I baked for about 70 minutes (seeds were fresh out of the pumpkin, cleaned, rinsed, and air-dried in a colander for just a little while).

Absolutely wonderful...Made these today after carving our jack 'o lantern. I just rinsed the seeds and let them dry. Used margarine, doubled the garlic, and used the rest of the Worcestershire. I also sprayed the pan with olive oil spray (know from experience that these seeds can easily burn and STICK). They came out perfect! Thanks for a reliable roasted pumpkin seed recipe!

Wow - without a doubt the best pumpkin seeds I've ever tasted! I took the advice of some other posters and quadrupled the recipe and substituted seasoned salt for regular. I also only had granulated garlic on hand instead of garlic salt, but I think they turned out fine without the added salt.

I did find that I had to cook them for nearly 100 minutes though in order for them to get that real crispy texture I love. I also laid them out on a paper towel to get rid of some of the excess oil that was in the pan.

Delicious!

Wow! These are delicious!  I used butter instead of margarine, and I quadrupled the ingredients as others suggested (including the Worcestershire Sauce).  Also, I used half seasoned salt and half regular salt.  Since I was baking supper at 350 degrees already, I baked the pumpkin seeds at the same time.  After about 45-50 minutes, they were done.   Warning:  These can be addictive!

These were really easy and delicious right from the oven, but after I stored them, they seemed too salty.  I think next time I would cut back on the plain salt, since the garlic salt is already salty.

I dried out the pumpkin seeds in the oven at 170 for a little over 2 hours and then followed the recipe.  Very tasty.  My new recipe for pumpkin seeds.  Thanks for sharing.

I just finished making this recipe. I should have followed the original recipe, instead I listened to some other reviews & added more seasonings. Not a good idea, they are very tasty but a little too salty. I will definitely make these again, but follow the recipe. I'm giving them 5 stars because I strayed from the instructions. p.s. I only baked mine for about 1/2 hour & they are very crunchy.

These are excellent straight out of the oven while they are still hot. But if you let them get cold, you might as well toss them out. Hubby and I scarfed down 3/4 of them and saved the rest for later... we ended up not liking them cold. This is a great idea though! I'll definitely make these again.

We made these two nights ago while carving pumpkins, and they were terrible. We even microwaved them for 3-4 minutes to attempt to dry them out before cooking. The flavor was good, but the consistency was terrible. No one touched them.

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin seeds but I really liked the flavor of this recipe.  I followed other reviews and microwaved my seeds for 1 minute and I had no problems with it drying out.  Added some cayenne pepper to perk up the spice a little.  I have to add that I used this for some regular salted peanuts and they were great!!!  I followed the recipe and toasted until the seasoning had dried.  They seemed a little rubbery at first but after they cooled they were delicious.  Very versatile.

These were very good.  I made two changes: I replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder, and twice as they baked I sprinkled them with Lawry's hot and spicy seasoned salt.  Everyone in my house ate them.  We follow the "Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type" diet, and for our blood types pumpkin seeds are in the "highly beneficial" category.  But until now we've ended up feeding to the squirrels the pumpkin seeds I've tried from the store.  Thanks to Carolyn for helping me find a way to get my family to actually EAT this healthy food.  My son eats them at lunch with his sandwich - like chips!

These were pretty tasty but it seemed like the worcestershire sauce brought too much flavor. Of course I ended up only getting 1 cup of seeds from my pumpkin so maybe with more seeds it wouldn't have been such a strong flavor. I will be trying this again but adjusting it a bit because of how strong the taste was. Overall quite good though! Still worth 4 stars, even done probably incorrectly! Oh and I also did cook them at 300 degrees and also did add some cayenne pepper.

My family loved these! I had 5 cups gone in 2 days, only thing I did different was add about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to add a bit of a kick since my husband likes it hot. We'll use this recipe every year.

everyone loved these, even my 2 yr. old.   i used butter instead of margerine (healthier) and added some powdered onion as well.  i imagine you could really get creative with the spices for this recipe.  i did have to raise the oven temp at the end to speed up the cooking process and to crisp the seeds up a little more.    i'm making these tonight and using olive oil this time.

Oh yummy!  I had to carve three pumpkins and we had a lot of seeds, so I doubled the recipe.  Plus I had to put them in for two hours till they were crispy.  This is the only way I will have these from now on!

Just like my mom used to make when I was a kid...for those who want some extra spice...add some red pepper or more salt.  This is good stuff, and so easy.  It did take longer than 1 hour, just check it every so often.

These pumpkin seeds were just so-so.  They had a good flavor but really could have used something else to give them a kick.  Also, 1 hour was extremely too long to cook them, mine started burning only after 15 minutes.

Very tasty, not your regular plain seeds (which I love anyway).  My husband really enjoyed them!

This recipe turned out really good.  Like most, I doubled the spices.  I had a double batch cooking and it took longer to cook.  I stirred the seeds about every 15 minutes until they were nice and golden brown.

These were really good.  I made them just as written but ended up cooking them for twice as long.  I probably had more seeds than the recipe called for though.

These are delicious. I used butter instead of trans fatty margarine. I also added some pepper, and a little extra salt. They make an excellent snack.

Great, tasty alternative to the basic recipe. I had about 4 cups of pumpkin seeds, but more than doubled the flavorings. Used butter, onion salt, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. It took longer than an hour in my convection oven. I'm glad I used so many of my seeds this way and will do it again next year!

I've been making pumpkin seeds the last few years when we do our pumpkins for Halloween. This is the best recipe I have found so far. Usually I'm the only one that will eat the seeds but this year my four year old couldn't stop eating them. My husband didn't care for them but as he said, "it's not the recipe, I just don't like seeds." I halved the recipe for one cup of seeds and baked them for 45 minutes at 275 degrees. I turned them often and towards the end I sprayed them with fat-free Parkay spray butter and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on them. We use that on popcorn also and it worked great.

These are wonderful! My whole family loves them~ even my three year old daughter was gobbling them up. They didn't last even a day. I really love the spices because they give the seeds an extra kick that makes them delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

All the adults liked this one but my daughter justed liked to suck off taste (she's not thrilled with the texture of pumpkin seeds yet). This is much better than my butter and salt version. Think I'll stick with this one!

Great recipe.  The worcestershire sauce made them so good.  I didn't have any garlic salt so I just left it out and they were still awesome.  I had to cook them a little longer than the recipe stated to get them as crunchy as I wanted.  This is my favorite website because of great recipes like this that I would otherwise, have no clue how to make!  :)

Yummy...my daughter and I made these after carving one of our pumpkins. I did double the amount of garlic powder and baked for longer then stated. They were crunchy and flavorful. The worcestershire sauce really adds a nice touch...will make again...thanks Carolyn!

I made these tonight after carving pumpkins and they were great!  I did double the garlic salt and add an extra tablespoon of worcestire sauce, but they would have been great anyway.  These are the best pumpkin seeds I have ever made!

Very tasty, pretty easy. I've never had pumpkin seeds before, and I'm still not sure how to eat them. But when they cooked up, they were so light & crispy you could just pop the whole thing in your mouth.  The shell is so thin, so it's hard to shell anyways, so if you eat them whole it's less hassle, and it still has a nutty flavor.

These little guys are bursting with flavor.  My only question is, does anyone really take the time to shell these things?  We carved 3 large pumpkins this year and it took me long enough just to separate the seeds from the pumpkin goo.  The kids loved them....only problem is my 17 month old daughter feels left out because she can't try any....maybe next year.....

These are fantastic! I used some acorn squash seeds I had leftover from dinner, and scaled down the recipe as I only had about 1/2 cup of seeds. I also used butter instead of margarine. So simple, and it's the best seed seasoning I've ever had -- can't wait to do pumpkins so I can make a big batch! Thanks so much for a new fave snack recipe. :)

Good thing I kept an eye on them in the oven. These would have been burnt had I used the full hour. It was only about 40 minutes before they were done.

I've been making this for years but this time, being on a bit of a health kick, I substituted the butter for coconut oil. Still amazing! I also add a dash of hot sauce to the mix for kick. I've found they always take longer than the recipe states, about 1h30, sometimes more. My only problem is there's never enough seeds in my pumpkins to go around!

We really enjoyed this healthy & different snack. And no added preservatives/chemicals etc that you'd get if you bought them at the store!
I used about 1.5 cups seeds, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, glob of butter and 1/4 tsp each seasoning and regular salt. 1/8 tsp garlic POWDER (not salt). I used the fresh seeds out of the pumpkin and pulled the strings off but did not rinse them. Roasted them for 45mins or so then had to leave but left them in the (turned off but still warm) oven. If not cooked long enough they will be too chewy.

Delicious! Dan added some liquid smoke to another batch which also turned out great. I think the margarine or butter really helps.

Made these tonight, but I doubled the seasoning. I started with the recipe as written and could tell immediately the seeds weren't going to have enough stuff on them to completely coat them. Doubled and voila!! Flavor is amazing and the only reason I gave the recipe four stars is because I had to double the seasoning.

Every year, I roast the pumpkin seeds the same way with just a sprinkle of salt. This year I was determined to try something different and this recipe makes me glad I did! I doubled the recipe because I had the seeds of 3 very large pumpkins and added a pinch of crushed dried chili flakes for some kick. I was careful not to burn by stirring several times during toasting process. My batch had the house smelling delish and the colour was just like it is in the picture :-) Will definitely remember this one for next year! Thanks, Carolyn and everyone else for the recipe and tips to create this recipe to perfection.

Love the flavor!  I knew they were going to be delicious when I could smell them baking in the oven, YUM.  I had 3 cups of pumpkin seeds so I doubled the rest of the ingredients, using garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I baked them for 1 hour and 45 minutes... perfect!

I never made pumpkin seeds with Worcestershire sauce and was a little concerned about how "soupy" it was when I put it in the oven. The seeds came out perfectly crisp and I'm still eating them!

Unfortunately, my large pumpkin only yielded one cup of seeds. Fortunately, I found this recipe and adjusted the seasonings to taste: 1 T melted butter, 1/2 t garlic powder (didn't have garlic salt), 1/2 t Lawry's seasoned salt, and 2 t worchestershire sauce. Baked on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet for 30 min at 275, then removed the baking sheet, stirred seeds, and baked for additional 15 min at 250, as I didn't want burnt seeds. Perfect flavor combo! I will definitely be making these every year!

I only had one cup of seeds so I cut the recipe in half.  I should have taken the advice of others and doubled the spice mixture.  These were not as flavorful as I had hoped.  Also, I only baked them for 30 minutes, stirring at the 15 minute mark.  If I had cooked for an hour they would have burned.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I added a little dill and lemon pepper seasoning today when I made these.  Although they were awesome before I altered the recipe, now they hit the taste buds just right.  Thanks a bunch for sharing!

Best. Pumpkin Seeds. Ever!! I JUST finished making these and my husband I cannot stop eating them. 

When I told him I wanted to roast pumpkin seeds from our carving pumpkin he made a face and said he did not like pumpkin seeds but that I could go ahead and make them if I want. I am so glad I found this recipe. By far the best pumpkin seeds I have ever tried!

If you enjoy the texture of pumpkin seeds, these are really good.  I followed the directions as stated.  I did start them out in a casserole dish that was too deep.  After cooking for an hour they were still really soupy so I poured them onto a cookie sheet and let them bake longer.  They turned out great.

Excellent.  The only thing I changed though was I used 1 cup of pumpkin seeds instead of 2 cups and kept all other measurements the same.  Turned out great!

They're ok, but nothing amazing. I did triple most things except the seeds (as others suggested) and added season salt, instead of regular salt.

Best recipe EVER!  Sometimes homemade seeds have a 'funny' flavor, but this recipe totally took care of that.  This is the only recipe I will use from now on :)

This was good, but definately need to triple the seasoning mixture.  The flavor is similar to chex mix seasoning.

I used squash seeds instead of pumpkin seeds and found that letting the seeds dry in the oven for a bit first made the end result more crispy and less chewy.

Not my favorite recipe.  I picked this recipe since it had so many wonderful reviews.  I read the critiques and followed others suggestions and increased the amounts of all ingredients.  I may have cooked it too long (so it may be user error), but at any rate as I type this I am eating them.  I'd defiantly try this again with some tweaking.

Yum! I've never roasted pumkins seeds before today...this recipe is so easy and tastes great! I did substitute season-salt for the garlic salt, canola oil for the butter, added 1 Tbs. of brown sugar and baked for 1 hour at 290 degrees per other reviewers suggestions. Perfect, crunchy, yummy!

I agree with the other reviews for the two cups of pumpkin seeds the remaining ingredients need to be tripled or quadrupled.  I tripled them and result was great.  Everyone loved it.

followed the recipe, but did not find these very good. I cooked them way longer than indicated and they were still not as crunchy as I like. The seasoning also was not very good. It seemed like it needed more. Probably won't try this again.

While my husband and I didn't like these (we're just not pumpkin seed fans), it was pretty easy to do and my friends loved them. One even asked for the recipe. So, I don't see the point in penalizing someone because the food wasn't my thing...therefore: 5 stars.

MMMMMM so good, really reminded me of Chex mix seeds!  Great recipe, I too doubled the spices & sauce simply because I love flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although my house smelled like worsteshire for hours, it was delicious! I too doubled up on spices except for the worsteshire. I couldn't stop eating them!

Well, I am sure they would have been great, however, I fell asleep while they were in the oven, so they ended up cooking about 1.5 hours and were def burnt. Oh well. I will try again next year.

So good! Taste like chex mix and make your house smell great.  Used butter instead of margarine.  When I washed them first it seemed to take longer so I baked one hour plus an additional 10 minutes at 350 to crisp them up.  Highly recommend to everyone.  Very addictive!

My husband LOVES these seeds! I usually don't like pumpkin seeds but I keep going back for more. We are actually going to go buy more pumpkins just for the seeds. I did use butter instead of margarine & double the other ingredients except the seeds. Can't wait to make these again.

Very yummy!  I switched the margarine for olive oil.  I'd make it a little less oil next time. I like them drier.  Very good recipe!

I made these last year and never reviewed them and I just made them again and they're great. Make sure to well salt your seeds as I get a little scared and end up under salting them, but it can all be fixed adding a bit afterwards. :) Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since that's what I had on hand and following the other reviewers, I also quadrupled the spices, but then, I had close to 3 cups of seeds to begin with. Delicious! I brought them to my company party last night and they were almost gone by the end of the night! I'll definitely be making this my staple recipe for pumpkin seeds :)

I made half of my batch of pumpkins seeds without the Worcestershire sauce in case I didn't like it-that half is so bland that I almost don't want to eat them!  Excellent recipe.  I'll be making them this way from now on!

I tried this recipe with squash seeds, and my family loved it!  The seeds were gone before they were even completely cool.  My tip:  use butter instead of margarine.  Looking forward to trying this recipe with actual pumpkin seeds.

Very nice snack, especially for fall!  We used fresh seeds, so I needed to bake them longer to get them crispy, and I added pretzels, and cheese nips to the finished seeds - they were a big hit.

This is a great recipe. Crunchy and flavorful. To make them more healthy I used olive oil and cut the amount in 1/2. I also used garlic powder instead instead of garlic salt and cut the salt by 1/3 and they still taste great. Health tip: Eat a handful a day, it helps you ge the magnesium requirment your body needs.

I omitted the butter and just sprayed the cookie sheet with Pam. Ended up roasting them a lot longer than I thought I would to get them really crispy. They turned out great, my boyfriend loved them!

I had a little over 2C of seeds so doubled the recipe and they came out perfectly.  I washed the seeds after scooping and laid them out to dry for a couple days.  I used unsalted butter so I could control the salt content.  I toasted at 300 degrees and only had in the oven for 40 mins and they turned golden brown.  Deee-lish!  Not too salty like some I've had.

I was worried these would taste too much like barbeque but they were great! I followed the recipe exactly but I did sprinkle a little extra sea salt on them after I pulled them out of the oven. I will make them again next year for sure!

Ok - get these away from me!  I can't stop eating them - they're delicious!  I followed some of the other reviewer's advice .... some said double the spice, others said quadruple ... so I went in the middle and tripled it.  I also used butter instead of margarine and replaced some of the salt with seasoning salt instead.  And added garlic powder. :) I had melted the butter and mixed in the seasonings then poured it over the seeds.  I was a little worried at first because it seemed like there was a lot of excess liquid but I think it helped to keep them moist (and tasty).  Thanks for a great way to use up the pumpkin seeds from the jack-o-lanterns.

This is my 2nd yr of making this recipe... my husband won't let me make any other recipe now  We LOVE theses !! Everyone who tries them loves them !! Word 'spicy' is a bit deceiving - the worcestershire doesn't make them spicy hot, just a nice flavour. 
Watch the marg/butter, if I have more or less seeds, I use more or less butter/marg mixture, depending - eventually you'll to it without recipe to your taste.
We did 4 pumpkins this year -- YUM !!!!!

I did as others suggested and 4x the recipe but we had 2.5 cups of pumpkin seeds. Also swirled in a bit of olive oil to keep the butter/margarine from burning. Overall they were pretty good, but I think in general I'm just not a huge fan of pumpkin seeds and their texture - but this is by far the best recipe for them that I have come across so far. Thanks for sharing!

These were very good! The seeds were crunchy and just a little salty. I added a little more garlic salt and sauce than this recipe called for, and I also used butter instead of margarine (butter tastes better in my opinion).  I will definitely make these next year!

Made 2 years in a row now.  Very tasty.  I also agree with some other reviewers that said you can double or even triple the mixture.

These were simply excellent!  I remember my mom making roasted pumpkin seeds when I was a kid - but I think they were purely salted (no oil/butter even) so they were OK, but not great.

I didn't change a thing and these were great!  They'll be on my list every fall!!

I halved the recipe as I only had 1 c. seeds.  An hour was too long in my oven, they came out tasting a little burnt.  I also used garlic powder in place of garlic salt as many reviews said they were a little salty.  Disappointed but I will try again, me thinks it might be cook error!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM........These are great in the words of my husband.  They really taste like GReAT gourmet popcorn at first bite.  They were super easy.  I tripled the spices...they were a TINY bit too salty for my taste but my husband LOVED THEM.  Very expensive tasting.  He said he'd almost carve another pumpkin to have some more!

This recipe was near perfect. After scooping out my pumpkin I had over three cups of seeds so I doubled spices except salt...just out of personal preference. The only problem I came across was baking time. It took an hour to get them to a slight crunch but they were still mostly chewy. So another half hour got them perfect....very nice but nothing special.

So far all the recipes I've tried off this site have been great and this is no exception.  I've never had roasted pumpkin seeds before and I'm in love.  They're delicious!  I tripled the spices but not the Worcestershire sauce.  So glad I did.  The flavor is wonderful!  I will definitely do this again.

LOVE THESE. My husband actually went and bought 3 more pumpkins after Halloween so I would make more. I used butter and seasoned salt, and I doubled the seasoned and garlic salt. Great recipe - this one's a new tradition in our house!

Great! Doubled the seasonings as suggested and also used some seasoning salt for some of the salt. For those that say the texture is funny, do you have you had pumpkin seeds before? I've been eating them my whole life and the they're always a little "chewy". Even hard to chew at times. The flavor makes up for it!

Spiced pumpkin seeds are the best pumpkin seeds ever. To reduce the cooking time to 40 minutes I let the pumpkin seeds air out over night before cooking them. It's easy, it's fun, and it's delicious. :)

This is a great way to make seeds!  I haven't made seeds in a while because everytime they were terrible!  I tried this recipe as a last ditch effort and they are delicious!  I didn't have any worshdishire sauce so I used Frank's Red Hot instead and added a little extra garlic salt like others recommended - terrific!

Delicious!  The term spiced to me was a bit misleading though.  These have a very subtle tangy kick which is very enjoyable!  Will probably make these from now on instead of the regular salted pumpkin seeds.  Don't forget to dry the pumpkin seeds over night first.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

These were alright...most of them got thrown away, but maybe we just don't like pumpkin seeds...probably won't take the time or ingredients to make these (or any pumpkin seeds)again.

Fantastic!  I added a little more salt, but the whole recipe was good to begin with.  My little grandson could not leave them alone.
This is now a family favourite and we don't plan on eating them the 'old' way anymore.

These are the best...although I would dry them out on a paper bag over night next time!   I had to cook them at a lower temperature for an hour longer because they were wet still!   Great Flavor!

Very good! I found the cooking time to be a little too long. I'll try reducing it to 40 minutes next time. It's probably a good idea to put the seeds in a colander and rinse them before proceeding with the recipe.

Good Recipe!!! But changed a few things.  Instead of just salt I used seasoning salt and more garlic then what it calls for.  Also added 1/8 tsp Onion powder.  I would suggest that if baking them streight from the pumpkin (cleaned) prepare to bake for an hour and a half to two hours (ovens work differently). If you dry them over night then should only take an hour.  Will use this recipe again, Thanks!!!!

Very Yummy!  I did double the recipe.  We had two medium pumpkins and they each gave  us about 2 cups of seeds.  I did allow them to dry almost 24 hours before mixing up the recipe and baking.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Loved these pumpkin seeds.  Used butter rather than margarine, and added some ceyenne to spice it up. A pie pumpkin gave us about 1 c seeds, and it only took 20-30 min to cook them adequately.

Great recipe! Doubled spices, added some paprika and cayenne (I like things spicy!) and it was perfect. I also used Olive oil instead of Margerine.  at 300 degrees it took 45 minutes to get them nice and crispy.

I could not get enough of these. I loved them and so did my husband. The flavor is super. Just make sure you bake them long enough. No fault of the recipe, I was just ancy to try them and they were a bit too chewy. Follow the recipe and  you should be fine.

Every year my kids and husband request baked pumpkin seeds from the Halloween pumpkins they carved.  So while they're carving, the seeds are baking!  This is the recipe I have used the last two years and it is the best!

These were really easy to make!!! I had a little more than 2 cups of pumpkin seeds and I wanted to use all of the seeds. I added a little more of the ingredients. I cooked these at 400 degrees cause I had a meat loaf going and wanted to cook at the same time. I think I cooked them for 20mins. Kept an eye on them until they were golden brown. They came out great!!

Great flavor, crispy texture, this is the perfect seed recipe! I only had 3 cups of seeds, and they are already almost gone and I just made them an hour ago! I followed some of the suggestions, using Hot Salt instead of regular salt and adding a bit more garlic.

Very good.  It gave a different flavor to the normal salt recipes.  My husband wanted more zing, so I added 1 tsp ground red pepper.  Next time I will add 2 tsp.  Thanks for the recipe.

I wanted so much to like this! But I can't rate it now.  I followed others suggestions by making the sauce mixture (only x2) and the seeds turned-out too moist.  I ended up cooking it for 2 hours and they were still moist and not crunchy as we like.  I will try again.

Great recipe!  The pumpkin seeds turned out tastier than they would have if I used the usual butter-and-salt recipe.  Next time I might add a little bit of garlic powder, but otherwise, I loved it.

Everybody loved these.  Several people made the comment that they liked them better then the traditional recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but I like my seeds crunchy so I did cook them a little longer.

This was a good recipe - better than the typical salt-only roasted seeds that one usually sees.  I will, however, cut the salt by about 1/2 and measure everything else per the recipe.  Some reviews suggested doubling, or more, all of the spices - I used 1/2tsp salt, 1/8tsp garlic salt, 2tbsp worcestershire and only 1 cup seeds which was a little too salty.

Delicious! We used butter instead of margarine, and tobasco instead of Worcestershire sauce, and they turned out great. I thought they were going to be spicy, but you can hardly taste the tobasco. Next time I might double the amount for more kick.

We used Teriyaki suace since we didn't have worchestershire and it was really good anyway!  It would have been better if we hadn't burned it a little bit, but that was our fault (we had the oven on too high.)  Highly recommended!

Nice twist on an old tradition. They have a "party mix" sort of flavor to them.  Would be good mixed in with some pretzels and peanuts.  I'm eating them as I type...very addictive!

These were really good. I made half of the seeds with this recipe and half with a cinnamon/salt/butter mixture to do a comparison and when they were warm I liked the taste of these better because they seemed to stay wet and you could taste a saucy flavor while the cinnamon ones came out dry. However the next day when they had cooled we couldn't taste any difference between the two.

This is a tasy way to make pumpkin seeds, but I had to bake mine for more than 1 hour.  (Next time I will add a little more salt.)

I used 2 tsp seasoned salt instead of the 1/2 tsp salt, and kept everything else the same.  Also, I do NOT wash off the pumpkin seeds or soak them in salt water.  Instead, just pull off the pumpkin threads, but leave them covered in the pumpkin 'goo'.  Gives them more of a pumpkin flavor that way.  I do cook them a little slower as it helps them to dry off and break down the seeds a bit better.

Was looking for a roasted pumpkin seed recipe.  Some said to boil and dry first.  I researched why you would want to do that.   Results said that pumpkin seeds cook unevenly with the inside cooking faster than the shell resulting in burned insides.  So ...

I boiled for 10 minutes in salty water first as suggested.  Mixed up the spices, butter and seeds in a bowl and spread on a cookie sheet.  Stirred every 10 minutes for about 65 minutes.  They were perfect.  Now I'll tailor the spices/salt ratio to my taste.  All in all a good recipe.

Thanks for sharing! This stuff is addicting!! As recommended by other reviews, I doubled the recipe for 2 cups pumpkin seeds. I was also looking for a spicy recipe and decided to add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. The flavor had a buttery smokiness to it that was delicious. T I used these on raw in-shell pumpkins seeds from Halloween pumpkins, I was disappointed at the thought of having to wait a year until next Halloween or until we dared to make pumpkin pie from real pumpkin. So I just bought raw unshelled pumpkin seeds, cashews, pecans and almonds. I am excited to try this recipe on those so I can enjoy this flavor year round. I hope it turns out well.

So easy and delicious, but I recommend decreasing the salt!! The recipe is perfect except I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, no measured salt,  and then only salt the seeds once they are on the pan, lightly. Even this way  I still find it a challenge not to salt too much, so I can’t imagine making it as written.  Worcestershire sauce has lots of salt already. We make these every Halloween evening as we carve our pumpkins.

After cleaning our pumpkin, I rinsed our seeds by walking in cool water to clean them. I dried then overnight (left out on the counter) and followed this recipe with the only exception being that unused olive oil in place of margarine (personal choice). They are fantastic! Perfectly crunchy. Perfectly seasoned.

So simple! I buy my pumpkin seeds from Sprouts in bulk and then use the recipe and have never had a problem. I will add some different spices from time to time, but the butter and Worcestershire blend makes it so good! This is my go to whenever I crave seeds.

Best pumpkin seed recipe I have ever made. For some reason, mine didn’t required only about 20 minutes to roast on a cookie sheet. I doubled all seasoning and used olive oil instead of butter.

So crunchy and addicting! I only had 1 1/2 cups seeds from our 2 small pumpkins, used Johnny’s instead of regular salt, and did 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I rinsed and drained seeds in a colander, then put them in preheated oven on foiled jelly roll pan to dry while I made “sauce”... about 10 min. Followed baking instructions as written. They were done in about 40 min. I just tested them each time I stirred until desired crunchiness was reached.

I boiled the seeds in salt water until grey first to soak in the seasoning and made more of the sauce. Wasn't sure I would like it with the worcestershire sauce, but I was wrong. These taste great and are very addictive!

Amazing!! It’s a great recipe without changes. 

Having said that, I soak my seeds in boiled salt water for 24 hrs first (~2 cups of boiling water and ~1 tablespoon of salt dissolved, for every half cup of pumpkin seeds.). I subbed butter for oil when I sautéed the seeds - and I added ½ teaspoon of chili powder to the spice mix. 

Can’t wait to make them again!!

I made this exactly as shown and my family loved it so much that my adult sons were clamoring for more! The only suggestion I have is to be sure and make a double batch because 2 cups of roasted seeds will not be enough!

Man, these are good. I did make modifications after reading the reviews - olive oil instead of margarine or butter, seasoned salt instead of regular salt and upped the spice content. But as a jumping off point, fantastic. I hope I can keep from eating them long enough to put them in some butternut squash soup.

This was my first time making pumpkin seeds, but thanks to the good folks at Allrecipes, things were made a lot easier. I picked all the seeds out and they turned out to be less than what the recipe called for. Plus I soaked them in salt water beforehand, and besides, other reviewers claimed they were a bit on the salty side. So I cut down on the salt, but that turned to be a mistake. However, they made a healthy snack (though chewier than I expected). They're good for snacking on or salads, but a little disappointing considering we only make them once a year when we carve our pumpkin. Next time we will use all the salt.

I made this exactly as recipe calls for. Except doubled the ingredients. I didn’t even rinse the seeds and they were fresh after carving. They were crispy and delicious. These were delicious and will now be my yearly recipe.

I picked this recipe not having baked pumpkin seeds before and they came out really well!  I boiled the seeds for 10 mins and let them dry overnight. I then followed the recipe exactly using olive oil instead of butter or margarine. I stirred them every 20 mins but the full hour may have been too long. They are good regardless!

I did not think I'd Like them as during preparation the worcestershire odor was overwhelming.
Needless to say after the seeds were cooked I ate them up.
So good!!!

Simmered the seeds (fresh out of the pumpkin) for 10 minutes in water with 1 teaspoon salt (read it's supposed to make it more easily digestible or something?) and patting them dry before going through this recipe. The smell out of the oven was driving us CRAZY! The taste was good but I think the smell is better, and that PRATE002 is right -double or triple the seasonings for sure. Great snack!  Super easy.

I've  tried other recipes but this one is the best.  Flavorful and crispy.  I used butter,  garlic powder, regular & seasoned  salt plus the Worcestershire sauce.  Now how  to store to keep them fresh?

Turned out very well.  Seeds were rinsed right out of the pumpkin.  Doubled the spices.  Cooked for 70 min.  Delicious!

great recipe! After the seeds  cooked an hour they were still moist, so I turned them and cooked them another 1/2 hour. They are delicious.

Delicious - I listened to the comments and really went heavily on the seasoning.  Also added about 6 dashes of Tabasco - really gave it a nice zing!

I've been roasting pumpkin seeds around Halloween since I was a little kid and this is one of my favorite ways to have them. They're quite flavorful and easy to make. Just remember that they'll be on the sticky side due to the worcestershire sauce.

Delicious!  I make this for my classroom every fall and they are a big hit!  They always seem to take a little longer than stated, but I like mine to be crisp, not chewy, so that may just be a personal preference.

Made this with a new type of pumpkin, but doubled seasonings (except wor sauce) per other reviews. Got busy decorating and they cooked a bit longer then stated. Still turned out nice. Will probably add more seasoning salt next time.

Made it with butter instead of oil, boiled the seeds day before.  Baked for just under one hour ( I didn't want the seeds to get too crispy ).  Turned out awesome!  Love the smell from the oven!

I made this for the first time two years ago and it has become  a favorite!  I do double up on the amount I use and add onion powder, pepper, and paprika.   It is a hit with everyone that tries them.

I made this recipe just as the recipe states and they were so good and tasty! One of the reviewers commented on the butter burning, but I had no trouble at all. At 275 degrees F, and stirring 3-4 times throughout, they cooked nice and crunchy. The house smelled wonderful and now my guys want to carve more pumpkins so we can have more seeds! Thanks for a great recipe! This will become a regular season pleaser for us.

My Mom's been making pumpkin seeds the traditional way for years, basically just a metric ton of salt dumped on top. I'm not a huge salt fan so I went online to find a tastier alternative. The family unanimously agreed this was the best one. I changed it up a bit and added some onion powder, smoked paprika, and cracked black pepper along with the Worcestershire, salt and garlic.

These came out very good! I love the taste, unique probably from the Worcester sauce? The house smells so good from them cooking! I baked at 300 for an hour...perfect!

I roasted them on the cook top, so I can keep an eye on them.  I needed to shake off the steam/water that collected on the lid.  Very simple & very tasty.

Definitely the very best pumpkin seeds I have EVER made.. and I've tried many of the recipes on here... many of them being well like by my friends. However, this recipe surpassed them all! I suddenly got the urge to make homemade chex mix becaue that is what the flavor reminded me of with using the Worcestershire sauce. I did make a few changes. I used olive oil in place of butter and sea salt and garlic powder in place of garlic salt. Also, I only let them dry half way which took about 3 hours. They were crunchier having used olive oil and as easy to snack on as a chip! Yummm!!!!

I would highly recommend using butter or olive oil over margarine. I prefer olive oil.

I'd also suggest boiling the seeds in salt water for about 10 minutes. This is supposed to keep the insides from burning while the outside is still not done. I've done this every time, and have never had the inside burn.

They are a great idea if you don't want plain pumpkin seeds. I personally swap out the garlic salt for fresh chopped garlic though. Also, between 2 batches I have made I found that boiling the seeds in salt water for 10 minutes before baking yeilds a tastier finished seed. Watch the cook time though, mine this last time around only took about 40 minutes from start to finish before they were perfectly crispy.

I HIGHLY recommend using ANY kind of squash seed, and not just pumpkin. I was making roasted acorn squash and had some lovely seeds that I used with this recipe. Awesome! I was pleased that I could use every part of the vegetable. :)

Dried my seeds for 24 hours.

Did first 30 minutes at 300 F, last 15 at 275 F, stirring every 15 minutes.

Like others, I put way more spices in! Used garlic power, onion powder, Worstershire, olive oil, tons of salt, some pepper.... And my secret ingredient, Emeril's "Original Essence".

Delicious!!!

These were fantastic. It would never have occurred to me to use Worcestershire sauce on pumpkin seeds. I put them in for the full hour and sadly didn't check on them frequently enough towards the end. They got a little over toasty. 50 minutes probably would have been perfect, but they still tasted good!

These were fantastic!  I doubled the seasoning/sauce and subbed seasoned salt for the regular salt as I read in a few reviews.  Great advice!!  Everyone raved about them - even my extraordinarily picky boyfriend.  
I did boil them for about 10 minutes before roasting this time and I think I will continue using this method. The shells didn't seem as 'splintery' as when I dry roasted seeds in the past.

I only had 3/4 cup pumpkin seeds from a fresh pumpkin.  I intended to cut the ingredients in half, but by the time I was ready to make them, I forgot.  WOW, they were so good!  I did change half the salt to seasoned salt, and soaked the seeds overnight in the flavoring.  I may buy another pumpkin just so I can make these again!

A success! We had to adjust the recipe a bit because we could only find peeled, pre-roasted seeds. We used 600 g of seeds, and since they were already cooked, we shortened the oven time to about 15-20 minutes, just enough to infuse the flavour.

I've never really cared for pumpkin seeds in the past, but now I can't wait to get another pumpkin so I can make them again! I sprinkled them with a tiny bit of parmesan cheese during the last few minutes. They were a huge hit with my family and guests from our pumpkin carving party. We all loved this easy, healthy, and delicious snack. Yum!

Using two cups of Pumpkin seeds

-Double everything except the butter 

-300 degrees for 1.5 hrs. (varies depending upon how deep your pan is) -stir seeds every 15 mins (the juice will evaporate so watch closely after that), and rotate the pan every 30 min.

-I used minced garlic and added a little more salt since I did not have garlic salt.  Good!

Followed this recipe as directed. Actually made a triple batch. Cooking for an hour at a lower temperature is the ticket. Honestly, I like them a little spicer but all in all these are very tasty! Six cups of roasted pumpkin seeds only lasted three days in our house. Yummy! Thank you bunches for sharing.

I read alot of reviews and decided to gage the amount of seasonings. So at first I followed the recipe exactly and I checked them every 15-20 minutes to stir them. I added more seasonings and sauce everytime as they just didn't look brown enough to me. After an hour they were perfect.

turned out great.  WARNING though:  I tried the variation with extra seasonings as some commenters suggested.  It was way too salty.  I strongly recommend you try it the way the original recipe suggests.  You can always add additional salt later.

Only room for improvement is that recipe doesn't say how big a baking dish or how thin to spread them.  I used the biggest one I could find so that they were only one seed deep.   Might be helpful to tell us what size pan you recommend if we're to use 2 cups of seeds?

Yum this recipe is great! followed it except added just a touch more of everything. Also followed the advice of someones previous review to microwave the seeds to dry them out. Also only had them in the oven for about 45 minutes because they were on the verge of burning and sprinkled parmasean cheese for the last 5 minutes in the oven!

Tweaked it: After doubling the recipe, I used butter. I also added a few grinds of pepper and extra Worcestershire sauce to make it and 'adult' pleaser.  I roasted mine 'low and slow' as they ended up in the oven for closer to two hours, giving them a stir every 15 min between costumes and trick or treaters (My seeds came straight from the kids carving pumpkins-no rinse)
They were buttery, crunchy, nutty tasting and all 5 adults devoured them! Wish I had more pumpkins!

I've been making pumpkin seeds for years and mostly winging it.  Sometimes using butter, sometimes olive oil.  This recipe was great - took all of the guess work out.  They weren't too chewy or overdone either.

I followed the advice and quadrupled the spices as well and I doubled the Worcestershire.  One word of advice - if you quadruple the salt use garlic powder instead of garlic salt (also quadruple this).  To use as much salt as you would wind up with by simply using 4 times the seasonings would be like a salt lick!  I love salty foods but found that even by substituting the garlic powder my seeds are still pretty salty.  I don't usually like pumpkin seeds but these are wonderful!

What a great pumpkin seeds recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used seasoned salt in place of plain salt. I also had to quadruple the recipe to well season my 2 cups of seeds. What a fabulous recipe!

When carving pumpkins for Halloween why wastes such delicious seeds. I always ask people for their seeds when they are carving pumpkins... it is so easy to roast them and they taste absolutely delicious... This recipe is very good the only things I did different were cut the butter back to 1 tablespoon (it could have even been cut back a little more I think) and also used Lawry's Seasoning Salt in place of regular salt... The Worcestershire sauce is good but can be a little powerful next time I will make two batches one with and one without the sauce. Very good way to roast seeds thanks for sharing..

I made a few changes and they turned out fantastic.  I doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce, used raw butter instead of margarine and used seasoned salt instead of regular.  They turned out fan-frickin-tastic.  Between me, my 7 year old and my 2 year old, they were all gone in less than 15 minutes.  My oldest has begged me to carve more pumpkins so we can have more pumpkin seeds.  I'm not that desperate, but I might try finding raw pumpkin seeds elsewhere and roasting them.

Very Good! I followed these directions even though I pre dried the seed's for 24 hours, however, I did not boil with salt water or any other treatment. Just check to be sure your not burning them if you dry them first and make sure to stir them around a few times to rotate the hot spots. 
Has the right amount of zing without the typical "pumpkin pie spice" seasoning usually associated with this type of seasonal fare.
Very well done!

I had 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin seeds (fresh out of the pumpkin, not dried) and I used the amount of butter and Worcestershire sauce recommended for the two cups but I subbed seasoning salt for the salt and roasted garlic powder for the garlic salt. The recipe needs more flavor...I would double the garlic powder next time.  Overall, good, not great.

Can someone tell me how to stop eating these? I used real butter - and instead of garlic salt, used a garlic bread/cheese sprinkle and doubled the amount of salt, kept everything else the same- these are amazing! Only took 35 MINUTES TO COOK!! I stirred them every 10 minutes to make sure they were doing okay and they cooked evenly in color. Thanks Carolyn - you also have a beautiful name :)

Delicious!  I couldn't stop eating them!  The seasoning was perfect.  It tasted like popcorn to me.  I had a fresh pie pumpkin that I cooked on a sprayed and foil-wrapped cookie sheet.  When the pumpkin was done, I put the seeds on the same sheet.  It was getting late when I put them in the oven, so I turned the oven up to 325 and cooked them for 20 min (w/ no stirring).  They were a little dry (sunflower seed shell texture), so next time I'll try cooking them @ 325 for 15 minutes.  My husband, the picky eater LOVED them!

This was very tasty. The only thing I did different was omit the salt because I boiled the seeds in salty water to get them soaked through with it. Was very good

These were so good. I did use butter instead of margarine and I added a little more of each ingredient.  I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on them before baking. I will never use another recipe. Thanks so much!!

I baked the seeds for 20 mins. without the sauce then mixed it in. Also did half butter - half canola oil  and doubled the other ingreds along with a bit of garlic powder. It was just enough for 2 1/4 cups seeds. The BEST seeds I've made yet!!  CHANGE to a new update. 4x's the recipe - 1/3 butter to 2/3 olive oil - seasoned salt in place of reg. Bake 1 hr. + 10 min. - stirring every 10 min. PERFECT!!!! Thanks for all the reviews to make this yummy!!

YUM! I could honestly tell my kids these seeds taste like salty, buttered popcorn, because they do! And they smelled so good in the oven. I tried this recipe with squash seeds. Sub'd olive oil for the margarine and doubled the salt and garlic salt. Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe!  Only rated it 4 stars though as I doubled the recipe of ingredients to 3 cups of seeds.  Did not have any garlic salt, so used powder and kept same amount of salt.  Also, I added 2 tsp of brown sugar just to give a little bit of sweet crunch!!  Huge hit.  Will definitely make again.

This is ok. It's salty enough, but I was hopeing for more flavor.  Maybe next time I'll add  more Worcestershire sauce.

Must be a taste-preference thing. I doubled the recipe bc the reviews suggested the more "sauce" the better. My boyfriend and I would like to disagree...

Beautiful and delicious. Using raw seeds is a must - especially if they come fresh out of the pumpkin. I added some smoked paprika and olive oil in addition to the spices and Worcestershire. I will be making these all fall.

Really easy to make, and good! Will definitely make again! My oven runs too hot sometimes so they were a bit overcooked, but I'm sure they'd be 5-star with a proper oven!

As the recipe is written, these seeds are a little bland in my opinion.  After reading other reviews, the next time I make them, I will increase the seasonings to give the seeds a little punch.

Pretty good.  Be careful about over cooking them; they quickly go from good to bad if not careful.

EXCELLENT! These are hands down THE BEST TASTING seeds you'll ever roast and enjoy! I did take the suggestion of some of the reviews and I quadrupled the ingredients for the same 2 cups of seeds. My husband can't get enough of these seeds and my, usually picky eating kids, gobbled them up as well. I will probably never make them any other way. Thanks for sharing!

I keep coming back to this recipe every year, and I always share it with friends who ask for it. I do double to quadruple the recipe except for the Worcestershire sauce, which I only double for the quadrupled recipe. It's a big hit every time, and they never last long! Thanks for this amazing family favorite.

Wonderful snack! The seeds were soaked in salt water for a couple of hours fitst.  I doubled the ingredients with the exception of the seeds and cooked them a little bit longer. Nice and crispy.

With a few changes, these are excellent. As another reviewer suggested, I tripled every ingredient except for the seeds, and they were delicious! The taste reminded me of Chex mix. My mom really liked them as well. I would make these again when I have pumpkin or squash seeds around that need to be used. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious recipe for roasted pumpkin seeds and an excelletn way to make a snack out of what is usually discarded from a Jack-O-Lantern.  I don't like garlic powder and so used cumin instead but apart from that kept this recipe the same

WOW! This is a keeper! I made it for a party, forgot to bring them, but had an after party at my house the next day and they vanished as soon as I put them out. I followed the others advice and used more spice to seed ratio. The saltier the better! I will make this every year! Thanks so much.

Good all-purpose pumpkin seed recipe. I baked them a little longer, as the reviews suggested, and substituated more seasoned salt for regular. Not anything novel, but very good.

Terrific recipe--fast, easy, and delicious.  As others suggested doing, I used at least twice the amount of salt, Worcestershire, and garlic powder (didn't have garlic salt), and set the oven to 300.  Will definitely make this again.

Like most of the reviews I read I quadrupled the recipe.  This was my first attempt at making spiced pumpkin seeds.  They turned out pretty good.  I think the butter was a little much.  Next time I will try olive oil.

Yummy!  Unfortunately, only had one cup of pumpkin seeds.  Opted to use olive oil instead of margarine and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also used a chili garlic sea salt as opposed to regular salt, will make again, thanks!

This is delicious, and, other than separating the pumpkin seeds from the stringy goo inside the pumpkin, simple. Our grocery store didn't have vegetarian worcestershire sauce and I didn't have time to go to the health food store, so I used tamari instead. I wish I had been patient and removed more than 2 cups of seeds from the pumpkin because my daughter took half of them to a party. thanks!

I used olive oil instead of margarine, and I doubled the amount of it.  I quadrupled the rest of the ingredients.  I used McCormack Season All in place of the salt and the garlic salt.  FANTASTIC!  The kids will be lucky if there are any left come morning!

These were easy to make and tasty.  I boiled them first in salt water until grey and then tossed them in the mixture.  I substituted garlic powder in place of the garlic salt.  Came very tasty.

I don't like pumpkin, but I decided to try making these seeds, and to my delight they were delicious! I wish I would have saved more seeds.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I haven't had roasted pumpkin seeds for MANY years...certainly have never made them!  This was so good and so easy...the only thing I didn't have was garlic salt...so I just added a tad more of kosher salt.  Delicious!

I've made this multiple times now, and the previous time I had only a cup of pumpkin seeds and it was still good. The spice mixture tastes similar to a tasty chex mix. I added a little bit of paprika for some extra color and spice.

A great snack my entire family enjoys.  I have tried other recipes which only call for salt and oil/butter.  They were just okay.  I really like the addition of the worcestershire sauce.

Awesome!  I was in a hurry and found this recipe.  After reading several reviews, I tweaked the recipe by doubling the spices with the exception of the Worcestershire sauce, and I also subbed the margarine with olive oil.  I only had to bake this for 50 minutes at the recommended temperature.  My hubby and I can't stop eating them!

I made my seeds this morning so my son could take them for his snack at school today. I made most of them the way I do every year just margarine and salt then I made about a 1/3 of them this way. My 8 year old son's reaction to this way (with all the seasonings) "These are WAY better". Now I just wish I had more to roast.

I made this recipe for the first time on Sun., 10/25/09, using some small pumpkins I purchased at a farmer's market. Not only is this recipe the best for pumpkin seeds, but I also cut up the pumpkins into small chunks, cooked them  and will use for fresh pumpkin pies.  Thank you so much!

2 cups is not enough! Not the way Ive been eating them anyways! I followed another review and boiled the seeds first, and then I followed the rest of the recipe, except I used butter instead of margarine. and this is the best they have ever tasted in all these years of making them! this is how I will make them from every year on out now!

Yum! Just took them out of the oven, they're still warm and they are de-lish. I'll admit I changed the recipe a lot. Used Pickapeppa sauce instead of Worcestershire (a vegetarian substitute, Worce sauce has anchovies) and vegetable oil instead of butter (to make it vegan). Then I added seasoned salt, garlic salt, and regular salt to taste. Use a spoon to stir it and then lick your spoon to see how seasoned it is. It will lose some flavor in the oven. I used seeds from 3 pumpkins that I carved, so separating them from the pulp was the hardest part of this. Now I have a great snack!

I followed the advice of others who used this recipe, and I quadrupled the seasoning mixture. They do taste good, and they look just like the photo, but they are really salty. I think if I were to make them again, I would double the recipe, not quadruple it. I would also use a slotted spoon to put the pumpkin seeds on the parchment paper. But, overall, they are quite tasty! You don't even have to crack the shell, you can just eat them whole.

This is the best spiced pumpkin seed recipe I've tried, although I still feel like there might be a way to improve upon it.  That's why I'm giving it a 4 stars instead of 5, although it deserves a 4.5 star rating.

I use garlic powder instead of the garlic salt.  Also, I double the margarine and Worcestershire sauce.  After roasting the seeds as the recipe says, I put the seeds on cookie sheets and sprinkle with Lawry's salt, bake them for one more hour, mix them up, and let them sit overnight in the closed oven.

Soooo tasty!  I used seasoning salt instead of plain salt and upped the garlic a bit.  Also added a pinch of onion powder.  This is really similar to the chex party mix flavor that I adore.  Way to Go Carolyn!

Followed advice of others, doubling everything except the worchestershire.  They were good.  However, we found we preferred the sugar and spice seeds more.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

These were fantastic. I don't like roasted pumpkin seeds but my husband always requests them. I found myself even snacking on these!

These are tasty and addictive. HOWEVER, they are VERY salty and greasy. Everyone who became hooked on these had cracked lips after day #2, and the kids didn't want them at all. I roasted some pumpkin seeds with just a sprinkling of salt later in the week, and the kids scarfed those down.

I dunno - maybe I am not a pumpkin seed fan - too much work to get to the meat, and unlike some, I do not like to eat the shell.  I am giving 4 stars though because the flavor of this is really very good... if you can get past the shell into the meat.  (I had a lot of seeds, so I made some of this, some of the "Spiced Pumpkin Seeds" and some of the "Cinnasweet pumpkin Seeds."  Ds7 liked this one quite well - and he is one of those that will eat the whole seed.)

I made the suggested changes of doubling everything but the Worcester Sauce.  They didn't have enough salt for my taste even with the doubling, so I waited until there were about 15 minutes or so left of baking and salted to taste.

I think this is going to be the first year I actually eat all my pumpkin seeds. I've made them several times before using different methods and they're usually still leftovers come next fall, but this recipe is very tasty and flavorful. It's great.

The taste was good BUT I found they were a bit greasy.  So many here have suggested to double the spices; I don't think they mean for us to also double the butter, just the worstechire, salt and garlic salt :-)

My husband, who never gives anything 5 stars, rated this one for me.  I used butter and garlic powder because that's what I had and I really didn't measure, just "eye-balled".  I also baked them at 300 degrees and shortened the time a little bit....about 45-50 mins.  Yummy!

they taste more like popcorn than pumpkin seeds from my childhood.  still not too bad, just think the butter base may not be right.  will try olive oil next time.

If you like Chex mix, you'll love this recipe!  I used 3 c. of seeds, but tripled the recipe as stated, using half butter and half olive oil.  I do think that next time I might not triple the butter/olive oil mix because they were slightly greasy.  Watch out--you won't be able to keep your hands out of these!  For those who are also wondering, pumpkin seeds are also known as "pepitas."

These came out great! Everyone I offered them to loved them. I soaked the seeds in salt water over night and quadrupled the 'sauce', using 3/4 seasoning salt to 1/4 regular salt. Because I doubled the recipe as well, I ended up roasting the seeds about an hour and a half.

This was my first time with pumpkin seeds.  They were good, I'll keep trying new recipes throughout the years though just to try something different each time until I find one that's a perfect match for us.

Yummy!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and butter (didn't have margarine)... In the time they should've been done, I didn't feel like they were quite toasty enough, so I spread them on a cookie sheet, put the oven on broil, and CAREFULLY watched them til they were just right--just a few more minutes really.  We can't stop eating them!  Beware of tummyache!!

I doubled the sauce, used butter instead of margarine and used 3 cups of pumpkin seeds.  Still a little too salty and I think I would use season salt in place of plain salt next time.  If your seeds are fresh out of the pumpkin and not dry, you will need to cook these about 70 minutes or more to get them to a nice crispy texture.  I used a metal 1/2 inch baking pan, but think they would have turned out better in a pyrex dish.

this was really good. i grew up with just the salted kind. 
I did do a few things different, read the reviews and took some suggestions.
i soaked my seeds overnight in salt water. then i doubled the recipe BESIDES the amount of seeds. I also added Seasoning Salt instead of salt.

I didn't necessarily like these. The flavoring, I think was fine, but just the pumpkin seeds themselves, maybe... I've never had pumpkin seeds before. But they were a hit at my small group tonight and I was asked for the recipe.

I wasn't too impressed, but the husband sure loves them. I added more garlic salt then called for & with half the batch I added some hot sauce which my husband wont stop raving over. My daughter also loves them. The problem I found was the cooking time, I would suggest 45 minutes rather than an hour, I found it dried them out too much. However, I did boil them in salt water & let them dry for 24 hours before baking, so that could be why.

This was a really good recipe, but there were a few changes that I would make next time. I pulled them out of the oven at 55 minutes, I think I would have taken them out even earlier. They got a little to "roasted". Also, I love salt, but I think I would have  taken out the plain salt, and doubled the garlic salt in this recipe for a little more flavor and a little less saltiness.

I made this tonight with my seeds from carving pumpkins for Halloween. I used olive oil instead of butter, more worchestershire sauce, and added parmesan cheese and pepper. It was awesome!

These did not turn out good for us.  I was hoping that they would turn out good, because they did smell good while they were baking.  After tasting them, no one liked them, and no one wanted to eat any more that just one.

this is the second time i've roasted pumpkin seeds... the first time i would just as soon like to forget... this was much more successful!  They turned out yummy!  i essentially doubled everything but the Worcestershire sauce and used 2 1/2 cups of seeds.  I backed at 300 for 1 hour and 6 minutes.  And they were crisp, though a tab too salty for my taste.  i'll be tweaking the recipe on the next batch (which will be today since we carved 10 pumpkins...)

These were amazing and my little one's loved them. It is very hard to get things passed them. I was unsure about the worcershire (sp?) sauce but it really makes a difference. I would recommended this recipe to anyone. Very Easy!!!

I only give 4 stars because I didn't use these measurements, but I loved the idea of the Worcestershire sauce.  I used about 2 Tbs butter and the rest of the ingredients I just very liberally dumped in!  I stirred these at 30 minutes, at 60 minutes and then gave them an extra 10 minutes to make sure they wouldn't be soggy.  They turned out GREAT!  Thanks!

I made these and the Cinnasweet Pumpkin Seeds this morning, and actually liked the Cinnasweet ones better.  For these, I doubled the coating because so many reviewers suggested it, but this made them way too salty (and I like salt--I'm that person who adds salt to the tortilla chips in restaurants!).  Maybe I shouldn't have doubled the worcestershire, as someone suggested.  Anyway, I cooked for 1 hour at 300.  Tasted them, gagged, rinsed them off, then re-heated them to dry them off.  Now they are edible.  But they probably won't get eaten until the Cinnasweet ones are gone!

These are really good!  I doubled the sauce ingredients with these variations - butter, seasoned salt and garlic powder. You may not need to double the sauce, it will depend on your pumpkin, but personal taste is - saucy is better!!

I just can't stop eating these seeds.  I skipped the Worcestershire sauce and added a very light dusting of caynenne pepper.  Also used sea salt and garlic powder.  My picky grandson, whos diet consists of chicken and fish, asked for a bag of these in his lunch.  Next time I'll try it with the W sauce.  Thx for the recipe.

A keeper for sure.  I ended up using just a tad more of the spices because I had 2 1/4 cups seeds.  I cannot believe the reviewers that said they thought the seasonings should be doubled (or more!), because mine were just on the verge of too salty. Delicious though.

I really loved this recipe.  I typically use the same recipe I've used for years, but I finally decided to try something different.  Needless to say, the pumpkin seeds disappeared quicker then ever and several people have since ask me for the recipe.

Fabulous!!  I took the advice of others and did half the seeds for what the recipe calls for in spices, I also left them dry out on a brown paper bag overnight.  This was the first time I had every roasted pumpkin seeds and I'll definitely do it again.

Excellent snack, and I've never had success with pumpkin seeds before! They smell really vinegary when baking, and my boyfriend was wary...but once we took them out, and he tried one, he ate the whole bowl! "They sure taste better than they smell" he said. Thanks for this one!

These turned out perfectly! I dried the seeds overnight first. After baking, I stored the seeds in an airtight container and they are just as good the next day or the day after.  Yummy!

I made this for a Halloween snack and it was very good.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and I also used the spray butter instead of real butter, and I added a little liquid smoke.  My son said that they tasted a little like popcorn and he liked that.

I roast seeds every year and these are great.  I would suggest sprinkling salt and garlic sat on the seeds everytime you stir them up.  45 min. was perfect and I stirred them every 10-15 min.

Quite tasty!  A little more sweet than spicy but that's okay with me.  I used a touch of cayenne since I didn't have any tabasco.

Made these for a second time today and I used the same seasonings, just in larger quantities.  I think I ended up with about 2 1/2 Tbls. butter, 2 Tbls. Worcestershire, and about 2 tsp. garlic salt (no regular salt).  They have good flavor but something got a little scorched flavor.  Not sure if it was the garlic salt or the butter.  Still an improvement from last time.  Old Review: Besides using olive oil instead of margarine, I followed the recipe for this.  The seeds were good and crunchy, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  Maybe more garlic salt in the mix or som soy sauuce would improve them.  They were good, just not great.

Awesome.  Iwill make these again.  I, too,added more garlic and salt. I used butterinstead of margarine.
Kept them in longer so they would dry a bit more.  yummy!

These were wonderful!  Added a little more garlic salt.  Had people over that I had to coerce to try them and they loved them.  Ate them like popcorn.  I used seeds from 3 pumpkins so I had to cook for about 20 minutes extra.

I gave this a 5 because I think I did it wrong.  Something went wrong anyways.  I didn't have 2 cups of seeds so I reduced it and must have gotten something wrong along the way.  They tasted kinda burnt.  Next time I Will used someones suggestion of olive oil instead.  Thanks

halved the recipe as I had a lil' pumpkin. Baked time stated and then turned off oven and left seeds in the oven as it cooled. Perfect crunch and flavor! Yummy. thank you for sharing your recipe cause the seeds are harder to share.

Add some plain cashews to the mix (with a little more of each ingredient to taste) and the snack still turns out well.

My family loved this recipe.  We used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes, stirring the seeds twice while baking.  The last 15 minutes my daughter added more worcestshire sauce and garlic powder!  Yummy!

Not too bad. They had the right amound of spiciness and flavor, but mine just ended up a little burnt. Not sure why since I followed the directions exactly. Still pretty tasty though!

I roast pumpkin seeds every fall and was looking for a recipe to make them a bit more savory.  This one definitely did the trick.  The seeds cooked slowly and browned a bit, leaving them delicious and flavorful.  More more interesting than just salt and oil.

Loved the recipe!  I thought the spice combination worked great.  Added some extra salt when they came out of the oven.

These had great flavor.  I was very religeous about stiring the seeds every 5-10 minutes to prevent them from scorching and just provide an over-all even bake. YUM YUM YUMMY!  I don't know if there will be enough for my kids to try when they are awake.

i was a huge and strict fan of salt only pumpkin seeds...but not anymore!  these are fantastic!  i also subbed the garlic powder for garlic salt and cooked my seeds at 300 for an hour.  i might have to go buy a couple more pumpkins so i can make more of these!

These have a great flavor. I added some season salt and some fresh black pepper. I also used garlic powder instead of salt. I just wish they were a little bit crunchier.

I made a centerpiece for a party using a pumpkin as a vase, and thought what the hey, I'll try something with the seeds. They were OK, basically chex mix seasonings applied here, they took alot longer to bake than suggested.  I guess I'm not a huge pumkin seed fan...but thanks for the creative recipe Carolyn.

This recipe was ok.  Found cooking it for 1 hour was too long.  I checked it after 50 mins and starting to burn.  very easy.

these were pretty ok, i think the worcestershire sauce gave it a slightly odd taste..it seemed too powerful in there. i will leave it out next time.

These are WAY better than your standard butter and salt recipe.  After 45 minutes they were done.

These turned out GREAT. Use butter - the golden color and creamy taste are worth it!  Will use this recipe every year.  Even my soon to be 3 year old LOVED these!  The flavors remind me of Chex Mix...yum.

I am so pleased to have found a recipe for pumpkin seeds that I will use over and over.  I followed the recipe and was thrilled with the results.  I can hardly wait to hear what the children have to say when they try them tomorrow.  In fact, I have another batch in the oven right now but this time using seasoned salt instead of regular salt and adding a little hot sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce since the hubby likes a little spice in his life :-)

Very Good. Worst part is cleaning the seeds. Could be even spicer.
