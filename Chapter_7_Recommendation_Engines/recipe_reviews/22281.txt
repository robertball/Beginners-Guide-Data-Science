I made this in cake form without altering quantities. I baked it in a glass 9.5 x 11. It was delicious. I put all the chocolate batter in the bottom and poured all the cream cheese mixture on top. Then I took a greased knife and cut through it many times creating a marble like effect on the top.

I was initially disappointed with these cupcakes - they weren't as rich and gooey as I would have liked.  
HOWEVER, LETTING THESE SIT OVERNIGHT IS A MUST.  The next day they were rich, moist and much more flavorful.  I downed three of them before I could stop myself!

This is the same recipe my mom used when I was a kid, it's delish.  Don't cook for 35 minutes as the recipe states at the bottom though or they'll be overdone, I suggest checking them at 20 minutes, that's when mine are perfect.

These are my husband's all time favorite cupcakes, and I decided to make them for his birthday.  I definitely wanted a rich, dark, chocolate cake for these -  so here's what I did: I used 1/2 c. of Hershey's cocoa, 1 Tbsp. of pure vanilla, and replaced the water with strong brewed coffee.  I didn't change a thing with the cream cheese mixture except to add a little vanilla and make sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheese cakes.  I used foil baking cups to bake these and got 18 cupcakes.  Watch carefully - mine were done in 20 minutes.  Cool and store in the fridge as they're best the next day.

As I sit in my burnt cocoa/coffee smelling house, I can't help remembering how happy I was this morning as I shopped for all the wonderful ingredients to make these cupcakes.  Followed the recipe EXACTLY - except for using coffee for water.  The batter flowed up and out of the tins...all over the bottom of my oven, then burnt all over my pans, which will have to be thrown out.  After 30 minutes - tar-like consistency - same after 35 minutes.  WHAT a waste!  Now I need to go buy a dessert, because these were to be a "bring the dessert" dish.  Maybe I'll also bring one pan of the mess just so everyone can know that I tried, and they should not!

These are a hit everywhere I take them.  I use the foil instead of the paper liners which help prevent the cupcake from sticking.

These were yummy! I had no idea it was so easy to make cupcakes without using a mix. I'll never go back! Some observations: (1) The cake part is a little bland - not sure what to do, maybe add more cocoa powder? I would like them to have been more chocolaty so as to contrast with the cream cheese part. (2) Not very pretty... maybe next time I'd try piping the cream cheese mixture in? I thought the black and white parts would magically melt into something beautiful, but they looked like the same messy blobs of white they were when I spooned them in! (3) This recipe does in fact yield 24 cupcakes if you follow the recipe as it's written. I filled the cups up 1/3 of the way with the cake mix and then added a heaping spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and came out with exactly 24 cupcakes, none of which flowed over as others experienced. The cake with rise a good amount and 1/3 full is just right. With some tweaks I will certainly make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know if my rating of this is entirely fair, since I used a diff. cake recipe for the "black bottom" part, and I must say in doing so I didn't have any trouble with them sticking to the papers.  I can see why the recipe only wants you to fill the lines 1/3 full of batter, they rise so much!  I probably used 2-3 tablespoons of cream cheese per each (using the ziploc bag sugg) and a spoonful of cherry pie filling on the very top before baking.  It not only makes them delicious, but very pretty too.  Will make again for sure as everyone was impressed only next time I will double the cream cheese mixture and make 24 cupcakes!

My mom made these when I was a child. She put them in the mini muffin tins and they were alway the "wow, who made these", at any function. One of my friends uses them in her bakery/catering business and they are the best sellers.  The chocolate portion is soooo rich and chocolatey.  My favorite sweet recipe.  Just AWESOME!

A very decadent, chocolately cupcake. It has a taste that reminds me of chocolate chip cheesecake but is a lot faster, easier, and cheaper. I made as-written but might even experiment with the amount of cocoa in the batter, to make it a little less chocolately for my own tastes. But as-is these are fantastic, and I would reach for this recipe to wow people with. Thanks for sharing :)

Other than calling for miniature rather than regular-sized chocolate chips, this recipe is identical to "Grandma Gudgel's Black Bottom Cupcakes," which is also from this site.  Because I've made "Grandma's" before, I knew I'd love these too.  They're easy to make, pretty, and the taste can't be beat, particularly if you like dark chocolate cake and cheesecake.  And you don't even miss the egg! I have to say, miniature chocolate chips, regular-sized, I don't see one as better than the other.  Making these again, I'm reminded of why I liked them so much the first time.  Just as I did with "Grandma's" recipe, I found these baked up just right ast 20 minutes.

My daughter and I made these last night for her 5th birthday.  After tasting them, she said the were the perfect thing to have for her birthday.  We did use black cocoa instead of regular cocoa, so ours were probably a little darker and more Oreo-tasting than most, but they were great.  She had one while it was still warm last night and loved the "fudgy middle" (the melted chocolate chips) and she had a cold one today and still thinks they are fabulous.  We made 24 cupcakes as stated with no problems at all.

I did notice that there is a discrepancy in the baking times listed- at the very top of the recipe, it states that the bake time is 25 minutes, and in the directions, the time is listed as 35 minutes.  35 minutes is about 10-12 minutes too long, or at least it would have been in our oven.  I pulled them out after about 24 minutes and they probably would have been even better around 23 minutes. Even so, the recipe is a keeper for DD's future birthday treats.

My husband and kids love to help me make this heavenly snack and come on girls we all know how hard it is to get our men to cook so you know it's easy if they are willing to help.  It's great for anytime of day and very easy to clean up.

These cupcakes were completely bland. They weren't very sweet and you couldn't taste the chocolate enough. The cream cheese part WAS too runny. I prefer to not use an egg for this kind of center but thought I'd give it a try. bad idea

Soooo good! One tip: they don't rise as much as regular cupcakes, but they do rise, so leave room. Seriously decadent. I made extra filling and baked as individual cupcakes too. Yum!

I really like the brown part of the cupcake. There is not enough of cheesecake. I had only 20 (not 24) cupcakes of this original recipe and the cheesecake part was just lightly covering top... not even noticeable when eating. so maybe next time I will double the cheese mixture.
thanks for the recipe.

This is the same recipe I have been using for a long time.  I love these!  They freeze really well and defrost rather quickly so that I can have them on hand and ready to serve any impromptu guests.

Followed this recipe to the T and it was excellent.I wanted to use coffee instead of water like the others but couldn't since I don't drink it and don't have any laying around.  It is even better 2-3 days after. The cupcakes stay moist and the cheesecake topping eliminates the need for frosting. This one is a keeper.

These are so good! Especially the next day... they get a little more moist after sitting overnight. You do have to make sure you watch them in the oven though because they don't take long to cook at all!

I make sure to refrigerate these when cooled as they are very moist/tasty after being cooled for a few hours! I also used only an egg white (not the whole egg) & white vanilla in the cream cheese batter as this makes a lovely white batter. I omit the chips most times just to make it easier. I also make sure the Chocolate batter is fairly thin using a little more water, so the Cheese mixture sinks to the bottom. I only bake them for 20 mins. These are so very easy to make, delicious & a huge hit!

These are delicious.  I made only a couple of modifications: (1) instead of using one cup water, I used one cup of strong coffee (adds a nice mocha flavor to the cupcake); (2) I used half brown sugar and half white sugar; and (3) I added maybe an extra tablespoon of flour and teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa. I only baked them for twenty minutes to prevent burning.  I agree with other reviewers that they don't look "pretty" but they sure taste great.

I made 18 cupcakes with the batter (my perference) and cooked them for 20 minutes; they were moist and delicious. Made cute little treats for Halloween or anytime really. I also sprinkled with some almond slices before baking.

I loved the cream filling. I used the cake mix from Duncan Hines (dark chocolate fudge).  The combination was great. Will make this again. My kids loved them.

I made this recipe for a halloween party 2 years ago and it gets requested by different people throughout the year. delicious! I use a whipped cream, cream cheese frosting and it goes great! But you really can just enjoy them without any frosting at all.

These were tasty...especially a day or two later. The cupcakes were more moist and flavorful the longer they sat (within reason!) Definitely an uncommon treat.

My kids and co-workers gave these cupcakes rave reviews. I wanted a coffee flavor, so instead of 1 C. Water, I used 1 C. strong coffee. They were rich and dense and perfect. I especially loved the fact that they didn't need icing. That made them easy, too!

These went together very easily even though there were a lot of ingredients. I reduced the recipe to 12 but only got 9. They tasted much better than I anticipated because I thought the amount of cocoa powder wouldn't be enough but they are very chocolaty and gooey! Next time I will eliminate the egg from the cream cheese mix as was suggested by many I thought it was too runny. Standard size chocolate chips were used. All in all very happy with these! The only thing I would change is the name. Black Bottom just doesn't describe them well enough. I call them "Chocolate chocolate chip cheesecake cupcakes"!

I tried this recipe for my foods class and I was not all that impressed with it. It was like a very very heavy pound cake- it wasn't chocolatey at all, the cream cheese baked to the point where there was absolutely no creamy qualities in it anymore-mwhich sucked becuase that's what I was looking most forward to.  I wasn't hapopy with this recipe.

I love these cupcakes! Here's a tip: These taste the best when they are left to be refrigerated overnight. The cream cheese is so delicious and cold and it makes it so moist and good.

I hadn't made this recipe for years, but wanted something quick and easy and delicious to serve my book club. I followed the instructions exactly (using egg and cream cheese at room temperature). Perfect. I ended up with 20 standard-size cupcakes, not 24.

These were delicious! I added extra cocoa powder to make them nice and dark. I also ran out of enough cream cheese mixture for all of them and had to make about 1.5 times as much as the recipe calls for.

This  recipe was awesome. The first batch I made just the way the recipe was written, but I think my idea of heaping was little to much, because cream cheese mixture sunk in the cupcake and covered the whole top. The second batch I made with hazel nut coffee instead of water, as suggested by others. I then made a cream cheese frosting, added orange food coloring, lightly frosted and added either a candy corn or candy pumpkin to the top. For a Halloween/Fall theme. Everyone liked them at work. Next time I may add some raspberry filling to the top to make paly with the recipe a little.

these cupcakes were amazing. i made them for my boyfriends birthday and today im making them again for my mom birthday. i added a little extra cocoa. and a little extra cream cheese since when i changed the recipe to metric it did not equal the same as 8 ounces. one not so good thing about these was that when i changed the serving to 18 and then made the batter i only got 12 cupcakes out of it. besides that they were amazing. and i defiantaly recommend them

I just made these and I only got 16 very small cupcakes out of this recipe.  I followed the recipe so I am not sure what went wrong but I am willing to try again.  Overall, they turned out ok.  A little dry but I baked them for 20 min.  Will have to try 18 min next time.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cupcakes came out fine, but there seemed to be something missing in the flavor of the chocolate cake.  The texture did improve slightly after leaving the cupcakes overnight, but perhaps there needs to be more cocoa (or chocolate) in the cake.

My favorite cupcake recipe EVER!  They are so easy and quick to make...and always turn out PERFECT!  I recently made a batch for a friend's school fundraiser for her son; they were a HUGE HIT at the dessert auction.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

If you are a chocolate lover this is for you.  These cup cakes are definitely better the next day, the flavor, texture and moistness are enhanced over night.  I made them exactly as directed and they came out great.

These were good but I felt the cake part was lacking depth and flavor.  I may try using part brown sugar next time.  I used R.F. cream cheese and it worked great.  I ended up with extra cream cheese mixture so be generous when adding the filling.

I sub coffee for the water which deepens the choc. flavor.  Its an excellent cupcake.  Taste of home has an easy frosting that I make with it.  It includes cocoa, melted butter, milk and 10x sugar.

Wonderful!!  I used the tip from another reader and put the filling in a zip lock bag and squeezed it into the center of each cupcake.  I think this made it easier to get the filling down into the bottom of the cupcakes.  I also frosted these with the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site. I thought it might be too sweet, but the frosting is so light that it makes these perfect. I got RAVE reviews from family and co-workers!

This was the first time I had made these and they were really good. I had to omit the vinegar because I didn't have any. I used regular semisweet chocolate instead of mini. Like all the other recipes state definitely no more than 30 minutes. The only thing I would change is to swirl the two layers together. They were very good.

This is a family favorite. My husband's mom used to make this recipe for him a child and now we make it for our family too.  Perfect for making for a school bake sale or event, they look good but are low mess.  And by using Hershey's ingredients we keep it peanut-free.

I normally won't try a recipe if I don't have all the ingredients, but I really wanted to make these for my husband's birthday today. I had to substitute pureed light cottage cheese for the cream cheese since I didn't have any, used cider vinegar since I was out of white, added a heaping tablespoon of instant coffee to the chocolate batter, and doubled the cocoa.  Oh my goodness - these are DELICIOUS!

UPDATE: MY HUBS' CO-WORKERS LOVED THESE. I'VE ALREADY BEEN ASKED FOR THE RECIPE TWICE! OMG! It's SUPER rare that I award a perfect rating, but I just couldn't resist.... These are da BOMB!!! While I enjoy cheesecake, it's not my dessert of choice (and I don't like darkk chocolate ANYTHING!!!). Knowing this, I set out to make these to share with my neighbors and husband's co-workers and not to eat myself. These looked SOOO yummy, I couldn't resist the urge to sneak a bite. :) Not only was I pleasantly surprised, even my cream cheese-hating hubs liked these! Although delicious, there is one minor downside. These are U-G-L-Y lol! Since I was going to share these, I topped each cupcake with a mildly sweet white chocolate cream cheese frosting (BAKERAMA's carrot cupcake recipe, also on this site). The frosting was perfect! When I make these for myself (there WILL be a repeat!), I will not add any frosting tho.... While I was able to add some visual appeal, these are best eaten as is. NOTES: 1) I was concerned that my chocloate and cream cheese batters were too thin and actually thought I did something wrong. :( Turns out, both slightly thicken as they sit and they bake up BEAUTIFULLY, 2) ONLY FILL YOUR MUFFIN CUPS 1/3 FULL AS DIRECTED (these rise quite a bit!) and 3) Refrigeration definitely helps although I'm not sure it's necessary to refrigerate overnight (a couple hours will do and is a MUST). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, SHERIMA! These were simply fantastic! :-)

yummy! following the other reviews, i halved the recipe and it made exactly 12 cupcakes using my silicone cases. These were awesome! So gooey and yum.

Update - I made these a second time, this time using paper cup cake cases. I Kept everything exactly the same as the original recipe and expected 24 cupcakes. It made 48! I also had to reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes. Both times i made these, i used "Buttercream Icing Recipe" also from this site. They are awesome and i don't think i'll ever use a different recipe again!

I personally find these amazing.  I made them for my mom's 45th birthday and she loved them.  I will make sure I find the time to make these again!

I made these cupcakes for my boyfriend and I and they were delicious!!! I had about half of the cream cheese mixture left though, but I made brownies later in the week and swirled the remaining mixture in.  I highly recommend this recipe, and I didn't change a thing except I used the milk chocolate chips that I had already.

These were amazing! I am afraid to make them again because I just couldn't stop eating them. Even better with a cold glass of milk. I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars because it definately deserves it!

Excellent!  I made them in mini-cupcake form (baked for ~10 minutes).  I topped them with a cream cheese frosting (just cream cheese and powdered sugar to taste) and got lots of rave reviews at work.  Was asked to make them twice more for special events!

Pretty good! I didnt put the choc chips in the cream cheese, so I added an extra tblsp of cocoa to compensate. I like having the chocolate and the middle cheese filling apart, its prettier looking too (and sweet on the outside and cheesy on the inside) Also, instead of 8oz I used 10oz of cheese to thicken the filling so it doesnt cave in once it cools off!! I baked it at 350 for 20 min, and eat it the next day! It's very tasty.. good luck!!

I used vanilla nut coffee instead of water. They turned out fantastic!!! Made for a school bake sale, the kids think they're great!  Please note it is mandatory that these sit covered over night in order to get to their full moist potential. You can try them same night but you will find a hard kinda crunchy mess. Cover and leave them be until the next day and you wont be sorry.

first of all thanks to you for sharing this recipe... not only this is easy to make and preparing the ingredients are so simple it taste great... my hubby says its delicious and this is my first time baking cupcakes my past experience with instant cupcake/muffin mix was such a failure that i was scared to try. however i made this 3 times today for a birthday party tommorrow. the cake part did taste abit bland so i wud suggest adding a little bit more of cocoa and some choc chips as well... i agree with the other review that it doesnt look 'nice' but who cares as long as it taste great... :) thanks

Great cupcakes. I miniaturized them using the exact recipe and baked them for 18-20 mins (depending on your oven) and they came out GREAT! Still fill 1/3 full with batter and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of cream cheese mixture. Yum!

This is the first cupcake recipe I have ever tried in my entire life, and I am quite impressed with it!  It`s so simple to make!  However, like other reviewers, I found the cream cheese mix to be a bit runny, so next time, I am going to even put less egg in the mix.  But the recipe is absolutely delicious and it looks great!

I made these for work on a Friday. OMG they were OH so good. For time reason I used a chocolate cake mix instead of a homemade one. I made a hand full of cupcakes and with the rest of the batter I made a bundt cake with it. They were both so good. I did also use a whole pack of Chips (you can never have to many)Yummy and will make again and will put in my cookbook :)

Very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half with no problem. Definitely taste better after a day in the fridge. My boyfriend thought they were a bit wet, but I like a moister cake and thought they were good. We both liked the flavor and ate 2-3 each. Used 1/2 low fat cream cheese and 1/2 fat free, still tasted great. Enjoyed with vanilla soy milk.  The filling mostly got covered when baking.

This is one recipe which will be in my repertoire for years to come! It turned out so moist and the contrast in tastes was sublime. I substituted the sugar with brown sugar and used shaved white chocolate instead of chocolate chips. The recipe can be doubled as there was excess cream cheese topping (which I used up anyway, yum!)

I thought they were ok. I'm a chocolate lover and to me they didn't seem to have much flavor.  Although my husband and son loved them.  I'll keep this in my recipe box but i think i'm going to keep looking for the perfect recipe!

I loved them.  The perfect cupcake because they are not too sweet.  The cream cheese filling is so good was i using it a little too sparingly on the first few cupcakes - there is plenty of filling to fill all cupcakes sufficently.

Love these!!!! So so good. Definitely better after they've sat in the fridge overnight. Also guys, DON'T ALTER THE RECIPE AND THEN BLAME  THE MAKER OF THE RECIPE IF IT DOESN'T TURN OUT. Sorry, but I just feel like that goes without saying. Butter isn't the same as margarine. Baking soda isn't the same as baking powder. And coffee isn't the same as water. If you follow the recipe precisely and it turns out bad, then ok, that's a reasonable reason to leave a bad review. But don't change the recipe and get upset if it doesn't work out. Just felt like that had to be said. Ok. Amazing cupcakes. Thank you for the recipe!!! :)

These were amazing! I took them to a potluck and they disappeared very quickly. The only thing I changed was the vegetable oil. I used unrefined coconut oil instead (the same amount, melted) to give them a light coconut taste.

I am not so much of a dessert baker other than using boxed cake mixes.  Following this recipe, with the change of cutting the sugar in half, and the advise not to over mix the batter, I made a batch of good looking and deliciously moist cupcakes!  This one is absolutely a keeper.

Will definitely make this again!  My family loved them.  They definitely rise so do NOT overfill.
Made half with regular sized muffins and the other half with minis.  YUM

I can't even begin to say how wonderful these are! And so easy too! I get rave reviews from my husband's hard-to-impress Italian family, and they all request this for birthdays. Kiddos always love these as well. The only thing I change is that I followed the advice of others and double the cream cheese mix, and I'm glad I did. There wouldn't have been enough of it without. I also add about a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to the cream cheese mix. Just phenomenal. I've made these dozens of times and they always disappear quickly. Thank you!

Just made this recipe for a dinner with friends tonight...they are amazing! So easy and so good! I used the suggested hazelnut coffee instead of water and used 1/2 c cocoa and 1 T of vanilla instead of 1 tsp. I also added 1/4 cup melted chocolate chips to the cheesecake mixture to make a triple chocolate delight...it works beautifully! I also baked at 350 for exactly 20 minutes. Perfection! Thanks!

I added extra cocoa to the cake batter, and i thought the flavor of these cupcakes was really good.  However, I baked these the night before and took them to work, and they were all dried out by the end of the day.  I substituted apple sauce for the veggie oil, but I've done that on other recipes that were very moist.  All in all, this was an ok recipe, but next time I may try using a combination of olive oil and apple sauce to get them to stay moist.  I also had leftover cheesecake mix, and I baked it as cupcakes.  Those were a big hit too.

Just made these. They are so good. I made them exactly the way the recipe said and they turned out great. They did not spill over either. You have to make sure NOT to over fill or it will spill over. Will definately make these again, Family Favorite

These are fabulous! I replaced the water with left over morning coffee but otherwise made them as the recipe said and they turned out great. I read a few of the reviews and a few others said that they spilled over so I put a sheet pan under them but had no issue with them spilling over. I think maybe they over filled the pan. Yummy! Even yummier the next day!

These are great! I left out the chocolate chips in the cream cheese mixture and only baked them for 20 minutes (any longer and they would have been over-cooked). I made 2 cupcakes with just the chocolate batter because I was craving a plain chocolate cupcake and they were the best I have ever had! I will be using this recipe without the cream cheese mix the next time I make chocolate cupcakes!

I think these are pretty good.  I needed to use a block of cream cheese so I am glad I made these.  The only thing is that I would cook them for about 25 min.  I cooked them for 30 and that was a little to long.

Theses cupcakes were delicious i have also done them without the cream cheese  middle bits and yes i know it kind of defeats the name but these were being travelled in a car in vast amount to my boyfriends (American) football training for lots of hungry guys so i didnt want them ruined.. The went down a treat with "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe which i found on this site too.. thanks for a brilliant recipe.

These are really yummy cupcakes, I agree they taste better the next day. I did make mine with brown sugar instead of white. I will definitely make these again but I would still love to find a recipe where the cream cheese filling is a little more dense. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

I was craving cupcakes and was looking for a recipe that was relatively simple. I didn't want to have to use a ton of ingredients. I followed the recipe pretty much the way it's listed other than adding a bit more vanilla and omitting the salt. Oh and using regular sized chocolate chips. I baked for only 20 minutes as one other reviewer had said. Talk about super delicious cupcakes! These came out moist and just sooo good. The cream cheese and chocolate create the perfect compliment to each other. I will definitely be baking these again. Awesome.

Should have read the review suggesting not to bake past 20 minutes.  I put these in for 25 minutes, and they are burnt.  Also, I only got 19 cupcakes from the recipe, following the instructions, not 24.

Very easy to make from scratch. Since it was Halloween, I died the cream cheese mixture orange before mixing in the chocolate chips and it worked perfectly.

The recipe makes pretty small cupcakes. I would double it and fill the tins more than 1/3 with batter.

Yum!  I was only able to get 18 cupcakes, but the filling did sink to the center of almost all of them.  They are a delicious indulgence.

I love these!!!  And yes, I add the vinegar.  I have no idea what it's purpose is or what it's for (maybe ask Alton Brown haha) but these are just fabulous.  I wouldn't change a thing.  These are the best of the black bottom cupcake recipes on this site!!

These turned out excellent. The chocolate cake portion was very moist. I wondered how that would turn out given the ingredients. I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting from this site. It goes great on top of these cupcakes flavor-wise but in my opinion had a little too runny a texture. (could have been something I did wrong perhaps) I am taking these to a party tomorrow and am sure they'll be a hit! I plan to make these again for sure!

Taste great, but I have to make another batch because the cupcake liners stuck to the cupcakes and it is one big mess!  Cannot take to the party tomorrow.  I don't know a solution, I'm in the process of experimenting..uggh  Use coffee instead of water!

Easy to make.  But, to save time, I took a previous suggestion of baking in a cake pan.  Although the taste was not affected by doing this, I did find that this alters the presentation significantly.  Will try again as cupcakes.

I made these as written. They were great; definitely for those who love chocolate. Next time I'll try QRSC100's suggestion of using coffee instead of water, or maybe some mint in the cream cheese, just for variation.
