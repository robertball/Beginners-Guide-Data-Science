These ribs are excellent. I believe it is because the rub is so good. For me I need to slow bake my ribs in the oven before grilling so the meat is tender falling off of the bone. First I removed the membrane from the back of the ribs. Rubbed the ribs, wrapped them tightly in quality plastic wrap, wrapped them tightly in heavy duty foil and refrigerated for a couple hours (preferably overnight). Take the ribs out of the fridge and let them come up to room temp (Do Not Unwrap). Preheat oven to 300 degrees and bake the ribs on a baking sheet for 2.5 hrs. Remove from the oven and allow the packet to cool enough to be handled. Preheat the grill to med-low. Unwrap the ribs making sure to get all the plastic wrap off which should be no problem if you use a good quality wrap. The plastic wrap inside the foil packet allows the meat to hold in all of it's juices steaming the meat while in the oven. When you transfer to the grill be careful to keep the rack in tact as it will be tender. Slather with BBQ if desired and grill on med-low for a few minutes on each side just to get that good grilled taste as the ribs are already fully cooked. Enjoy

Finally. Something other than the generic BBQ sauce. Wonderful. I used slightly less mustard - personal preference. My family raved about these. Being South African, it's great having something different.

The rub from this recipe gets 5 stars!  The cooking method wasn't quite right for me.   First - I remove the membrane along the bones - this is easy to do by using a sharp carving fork and sliding the tine of the fork under the membrane along a bone towards the skinny end of the slab of ribs.  Twist the fork and it will lift the membrane - then use a paper towel and grab the flap of membrane and pull it off in one piece.  I used Deli Mustard and the rub - wrapped in the heavy foil.  I would prefer cooking low and slow for a longer time.  At 40 minutes the ribs were not tender.  I moved to indirect heat at a low heat and let them cook for about 1 1/2 hours.   Next time I will do them in the foil in a 225 degree oven for about 2 1/2 hours - take out and let cool.  Finish on the BBQ with my favorite sauce, which right now is Black Pepper Sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Do the foil part in the oven at 200F for 3 to 4 hours. Then remove the foil and cook indirectly on the grill. The meat will fall off the bone.

Fantastic... I made it with ribs twice, but ribs are too dry for me, so I made this for chicken, kept chicken in the foil packets as directed until tender, then took out of foil and put over coals, brushed with BBQ sauce (instead of steak sauce) and left on coals for just a few minutes.  It was delicious - the meat was falling off the bone, and has a delicious smokehouse like flavor.

This rub is great!  I slow cooked in the oven on 275 for 2.5 hours and then finished on the grill.  I added about 1/4 cup of a braising liquid to the foil before placing the ribs in the oven.  Braising liquid recipe: Bring the following ingredients to a boil on the stovetop. Cool before adding to ribs.
    1 cup chicken stock
    1/2 cup white wine
    1 teaspoon liquid smoke
    1/4 cup maple syrup
    1/4 cup white wine vinegar

These were very delicious. I had no problem with the times that Kevin set for the ribs. My very picky 4 year old surprisingly asked for seconds! These were an A++ in my book.

Well, all I got to say is THUMBS DOWN for this recipe. you have to have, at least, 3-4 hrs of cooking to get that fall off the bone ribs. I did not care for this method.

Loved the flavor of these ribs, although I did change the cooking method.  I cut the ribs into sections and pulled off the back membrane.  I then added the rub and wrapped in foil and baked at 225Â° for 2 hours.  After that point, DH put them on the grill and then proceeded with the recipe.  The flavor is great, and I do plan on making these again, but will continue to use my baking/grilling method.

These I will def make again. My family loved them. They were a little hesitant because of the A1 sauce but they actually came out really great. I actually made them in the oven since it was cold outside. I put them at 325 for a little over 1 hr then added the A1 sauce afterwards with the foil off and cooked them again for another hour.

IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MUST TO READ "LORI'S REVIEW and follow her suggestions! It may add just a tiny bit of work, but I have NEVER EVER had the compliments from such a wide-ranging group of palattes than I have with her version of these ribs.  Cutting the membrane, and PARTICULARLY wrapping in the quality plastic THEN the foil is truly what makes  this recipe so AMAZING.  I have never written a review before, but after 40 years, this is one time I felt the need to make an exception.

Made the ribs for a second time, and once again, a huge hit! I did put the mustard and rub on ribs and wrapped in plastic and foil and refrigerated for 2 hours. Brought to room temp (about 30 minutes) took off Saran Wrap and put in the tented foil. This batch was more tender than without taking some time to "marinate"

I used the cooking technique but only the ribs.  I had my own homemade rub which I rubbed on the ribs a few hours prior to BBQing, wrapped in plastic and put in fridge.  After BBQing for about 45 mins. I used a store bought rib sauce and the ribs turned out great - perfect tenderness but the meat did not fall off the bone which is what we like.  Thanks.
