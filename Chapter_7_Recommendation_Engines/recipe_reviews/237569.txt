This recipe is delicious! I  made a small change however, I added a chipotle pepper instead of cayenne. It tasted exactly like the honey chipotle sauce from Chilis! So yummy! I'm getting ready to make a huge batch for some baked beans and canning some for later.

We were a little short on honey and we used cumin instead of the liquid smoke. But this sauce turned our wings into the best we've ever had. Great recipe!

This is better than any store bought BBQ sauce.  Tasted great on my smoked pork butt.

The whole family liked the sauce. A few had slight comments about it though. My wife thought the original recipe was too spicy so she added more honey. My daughter thought after the honey was added it was too sweet. But all-in-all it was delicious either way. I will make it again.

This was a great BBQ sauce! The only variation was that I cut the amount of cayenne in half just for personal preference. Made ribs with this sauce that were just melt in your mouth delicious! Thanks for sharing! Made this again as written with full amount of the cayenne and we loved the heat! Yum!!

Great recipe.  I leave out the cayenne pepper for my kids, they think it is spicy with the pepper.  Other than that it is a great recipe.  Great on chicken or beef.

I'm allergic to garlic, so I leave out the garlic powder and the chili powder. I add a bit more cayenne and paprika. And it is still delicious! And no chemicals you might find in the bottled BBQ sauce. I store it in a Mason jar, so one less plastic bottle in the landfill.

Exactly what I was looking for to use up some pork & make pulled BBQ sandwiches.  Sooooo good!!!!  I plan to make a larger batch & give as Christmas gifts in baskets I make for Christmas-it was THAT good.  My ONLY alteration was I sub'd some Mango Medium Hot Sauce I bought at a local Farmers Market for the liquid smoke.  I am sure it gave a different flavor than the original recipe, but this came out awesome!!!!!  Thank you for another great Allrecipe!!!!

This was my first time making BBQ sauce. I did use apple cider vinegar instead of white. And instead of liquid smoke (which I've never used) and regular paprika, I used smoked paprika. I also slightly increased all the spices except the cayenne. And I had some roasted garlic cloves (5-6) that I had done the day before, so I made a mash out of those and added them while it was cooking on low.  Overall, very happy with the end result - I don't think Sweet Baby Ray will be getting my business anymore!

I added an extra 1/2 tsp onion, garlic, paprika powder but less salt and no cayenne. This is by far one of thee best bbq sauce recipes ever. Similar to Bullseye.

Went to make bbq pork chops and didn’t have any bbq sauce! This was a quick and easy recipe to follow, and adjust when I didn’t have all the ingredients.

Really liked it! It was a little too sweet for me so next time I will use 1/2 the amount of honey suggested in the recipe.  With approximately 2 1/2 lbs. of shredded chicken it was a little light on the sauce. I will make a double batch next time. I am so glad to find this recipe for do-it-yourself BBQ sauce. Most of the store bought sauces have cornstarch as a main ingredient.

This was good. I didn't have molasses so used brown sugar, but I think the molasses would do the trick and will be sure to use it next time I make this.

Sauce was delicious!  I didn't have molasses, so used regular syrup, and it was fine.  Also didn't have liquid smoke so used a 1/4 cup of Dale's.  This one is a keeper and easily modified.

Delicious! This sauce is rich, sweet, and just plain good. Since I had no cayenne pepper on hand, I added a few splashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce instead.  This is our new favorite sauce!

I added 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, 2 tbsp dark brown sugar and cut back on the cayenne pepper and salt. I didn't have any molasses to add but it was still great without it. I used it with pulled pork and I will definitely make this one again! Thanks so much for sharing it! ~ Gina
