I'm in love with this recipe!  I used veggie broth in place of chicken and added a bit of cheese towards the end.  I also added in some vegetarian hotdogs before I baked it to make a vegetarian main dish.  My husband loved it hot and took it cold for leftovers the next day which is something I'm always looking for in a recipe.  I sprinkled it with some paprika once it was done to make it pretty, too - ha.  
It was easy and comforting on a cold day and since I have the other half of my cabbage left, I might just be making again in the near future.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for a different side dish to make with the extra cabbage I had. I had everything needed for this dish so I thought I'd give it a try. My family really liked it and said that this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this as written except for topping with a little more black pepper and paprika before baking. Easy to prepare, simple ingredients and delicious. The whole family agreed that this one is a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

My mother used to make a version of this years ago and the whole family always loved it. This was delicious and the only additions I made were adding cubed ham and crumbled bacon to make it like my Mom's. It was perfect and we ate that and the leftovers as a main dish - it was all gone the next day! Thanks for providing the base recipe!

Very tasty, it's a plain comfort dish which is nice sometimes. I added chicken to make it a complete meal. I also didn't add any salt because I din't cook with salt.  I would make it again.
