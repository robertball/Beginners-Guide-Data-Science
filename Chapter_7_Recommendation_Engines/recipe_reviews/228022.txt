I make this, but I do a couple of things differently that makes it so much more tasty.  I put the mayo and the raisins in a blender and it makes the dressing much better.  After mixing, let it sit in the fridge over night.  Add the sunflower seeds right before serving.

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I would do different next time is to blanch or steam the broccoli just a little bit (my kids didn't care for the raw broccoli taste).  I also only used sugar.  Great!

I made a "mistake" and put in horseradish mayo instead of plain. OMG. It is FANTASTIC! It's got a zip like sushi with wasabi sauce. I also tried adding some raw corn kernels (freshly trimmed off the cob) which made it even better.

After beginning to make this salad, I realized all of my raisins had been eaten up by a "little mouse" (kids).  So I used Craisins and it was delicious.  Also, the Craisins added color.  Everyone enjoyed it and hubby wants me to make it again!

I love this recipe but change it up a little.  Sometimes I use maple flavored bacon and craisins.instead of raisins and no matter what bacon I use, I always put about 3 tablespoons of the bacon grease in the salad along with the mayo and Splenda.  The bacon grease gives a little extra flavor.  Love this salad.

I used no raisins, only 1 tablespoon sugar, no other sweetener and scallions instead of onion. It got raves for Thanksgiving dinner and I have been asked to make it again for Christmas.

I made this for a potluck and followed the directions exactly except that I used turkey bacon (some people in our company don't eat pork). So good! Husband and I almost wanted to eat the entire bowl by ourselves and just buy something else for the potluck lol!

Such a crowd-pleaser! We make this salad every time we are hosting a bar-b-que. It can be made well in advance and unlike a green salad, you will never have to worry about it wilting.

I've made this salad for quite a few years.  I always use craisins and either walnuts or sliced almonds (never have any sunflower seeds on hand).  We love it at our house!

A very nice side to dinner tonight. I only used sugar. The sunflower seeds added a nice crunch and were  'friendly' to my nut allergy suffering husband. Craisins would be a good sub for raisins or even a little diced apple. I think some cooked diced chicken and some extra dressing would make this an easy main dish salad as well.

I didn't have the raisins, but I did have a bag of dried blueberries, cranberries, and cherries. I used those and a bag of real bacon bits. I added tomatoes and cucumbers diced into quarters from the garden and a few pecans. I think next time I will cut the sugar in half, so that all the veggie flavors will come through. I put it on plates in a bed of spinach leaves. It was great.

I made this with several changes and it was Delicious!  I did not cook the broccoli, added a dollop of the horseradish mayo as one reviewer suggested (GREAT idea), added salted cashew pieces instead of sunflower seeds since I didn’t have the seeds.  Definitely skip the artificial sweetener!!  You don’t need it.  I always cut the amount of sugar for a recipe in the beginning. Taste it and see first before adding the full amount. Great summer side dish in my opinion!

I wish it said how many cups of chopped broccoli instead of heads which can vary greatly.  I basically chopped broccoli into my largest mixing bowl (which I felt was good for a potluck) and sort of halved all the other ingredients (omitted onion because I don't like it raw).   It turned out very delicious.

I always take this dish to any get together my husband and I attend, and it is always a hit! I put 3/4 cup of onions in the mixture instead of the half cup for which it calls. I also use two jars of Hormel bacon bits instead of cooking my own bacon. The recipe is just as good and it cuts down on the preparing time drastically.

A local deli used to make a broccoli salad that was to die for! I had the recipe but couldn't find it so I tried this one on the 4th of July. It was a huge hit with the crowd!!! I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I substituted sliced almonds. Dried cranberries replace raisins. Delicious!

I used turkey bacon and added a bit of apple cider vinegar to it. I would use less sugar next time as well but this was the bomb! I made it for a birthday potluck lunch at work and it was a big hit! I will definitely make this again. :D

This is a bit labor-intensive (cutting the broccoli), but well worth it! The only changes I made was quickly blanching the broccoli ( draining well on paper towel), using golden raisins and craisins ( for more color ) , and instead of all the sugar (plenty of sweetness in the raisins and craisins ),  I mixed the mayo with a splash of Hendrickson's Sweet Vingar and Olive Oil dressing . Oh my!!!  
Thank you, Ruthie Joyce!
So many compliments and requests for the recipe!

Two alternate versions that have been successful at my holiday gatherings:

Option 1: sub the seeds from a large pomegranate for raisins, use 1/2 cup mayo instead of a full cup, use 2 tbsp sugar instead of 1/4 cup, sub plain white vinegar for white wine vinegar, sub green onions for white/yellow onions, add 1 cup bite-sized sliced sugar snap peas for more crunch.

Option 2: sub the seeds from a large pomegranate for raisins, use 1/2 cup mayo instead of a full cup, use 2 tbsp honey instead of 1/4 cup sweetener, sub apple cider vinegar for white wine vinegar, sub green onions for white/yellow onions, make the salad more festive by also adding 1 cup quartered cranberries.

terrific!!!  I made 5 times the recipe for a gathering after a friend's funeral and it went very fast...no yummy leftovers!  I will make this often!  I DID use low fat mayo and didn't have sunflower seeds.

Very tasty but sweeter than it really needs to be.  I lightly steamed the broccoli, which took the harsh edge off, but it didn't occur to me until it was too late that by steaming it I'd probably reduced the need to use sweeteners to mask its flavor.   Also, I've read that you should eat foods rich in Vitamin C at the same meal that you eat foods rich in plant-based iron, because the Vitamin C helps the body utilize the iron, so I had a glass of orange juice with the salad and between the two of them it was a super-sweet little meal.

Very good. I had a similar salad @ Green Tomatoes restaurant in Florida and decided to try to make it myself. This was delish. I had to serve the sesame seeds on the side since hubby can't have seeds or nuts but all the flavors were there.  One issue I had...I  wish the recipe gave cups of broccoli. I bought a bag. Started with 1/2# trimmed but had to add some more after adding dressing. I would recommend 1# of trimmed broccoli flowerets. I think I would even like to try adding some diced chicken. The recipe is very versatile. Thanks for sharing.

Easy and delicious! Always a hit at gatherings, be sure to make plenty because it will all be gone! 
I halved the recipe and used sweet onion instead (no red on hand) and it was wonderful.
