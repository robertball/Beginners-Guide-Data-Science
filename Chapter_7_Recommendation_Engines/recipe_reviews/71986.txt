Very good, but in trying to match the hot dog sauce at a local landmark, I knew there was no barbecue sauce in it so I omitted it and instead added 2 tbsp. tomato paste, 1/2 tsp. cider vinegar, a little paprika and cayenne.  I also increased the chili powder and cumin.  This would be fine without using the food processor, but I did pulse this through a few times - again, to better match our local place's sauce....which I ended up doing, perfectly!  Thank for the recipe!  With my changes, it will appear at every one of our cookouts!

Rather than cooking meat beforehand, try putting everything in your pot and simmer for a couple of hours.  Found that we like it best this way.  No need for a food processor either.

Really tasty! After it simmered and thickened up I tasted it and added about a tsp of hot pepper sauce just for a little extra heat. Enjoyed it-Thank you!

good, but a lil too sweet. I made this for a bbq to try something diff, nobody put it on their hotdog but several ate it like a sloppy joe, on a hamburger bun. This makes a great sloppy joe recipe, i would add a lil more spice than sweetness tho

You can't go wrong making this per directions; your unique "signature" rests with YOUR CHOICE particular flavor style BBQ sauce, your custom amounts of chili powder AND that size "pinch" of red pepper flakes. This "sauce" has American Cook Out splashed all over it---and can inspire one to construct their own fancy Hot Dog.  I butterfly cut the Hot Dog franks; speeds up grill time AND doubles the amount of franks, so everyone has plenty to enjoy!!

I don't usually follow recipes to a T but I did this one except I was out of hamburger so I used turkey burger. I was pleasantly pleased with the outcome. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I make a sauce very similar to this one.  Never thought about putting the meat into a food processor.  I use a pastry cutter (like you would use for pie crusts).  Easier to wash than all the food processor parts :)

I am rating this recipe, having followed it *almost* precisely. I will list my changes, and then my overall rating. 

Changes:
a) I used 1.5 teaspoons of jarred minced garlic in place of fresh; 
b) I used 1.5 teaspoons of salt, in anticipation of the called-for "2 teaspoons" being too salty (see below);  
c) I omitted the red pepper flakes, due to wanting to avoid too much spicy for my sensitive little one;
d) no onion, due to family preference.

Jarred minced garlic was simply my preference, and I feel like I still got a great flavor from the chili. Overall, I don't feel like it was lacking anything without onion, so if you need to make this for  non-onion lovers, it would be fine to omit them from the recipe. I'm sure that the red pepper flakes lend a wonderful kick to it, for those so inclined to a kick in their chili, but it isn't necessary for the overall enjoyment, if not. My personal bbq sauce of choice, for those who may be wondering (I do, in reviews) was 'hickory & brown sugar' flavored, and worked well in this chili. The reason I give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because, even those I reduced the salt by half a teaspoon, I still found it too salty. (To the recipe sharer's credit, the recipe does read: "or to taste".) Next time, I will personally reduce the salt to simply 1 teaspoon. You might consider doing the same, and adding more, if needed.

It seems rather flavorful, and I might *almost* think that the chili powder and cumin could be slightly decreased,

I made it and Loved it!! I substituted chili sauce (Heinz) 3/4 c. in place of  the bbq sauce. I also added 1/2 of a green pepper diced. I skipped the food processor and used a lean ground beef.  It’s fabulous, reminds me of when my dad would take me to the dairy bar to get a footer with “sauce”.

I thought this was a good recipe but I was out of worcestershire sauce so I replaced it with A1 sauce. I tasted it and had a spicy tangy flavor that I liked. I prefer my chili a little sweeter so I added 2 tablespoons of honey and sprinkled a little brown sugar. Very good!

My husband loved this! I gave it 4 stars as I used all the ingredients listed at first. I added more chili powder, cumin and red pepper flakes as we love these flavours. I cooked the meat with the onions and garlic. While the meat was cooking I started to simmer the other ingredients. 

I did find that this sauce was pretty sweet. It could have been because I used Bullseye BBQ sauce. I added a splash of lemon juice to tone down the sweetness. I used a thicker hot dog bun and put a beef hot dog in the bun topped with the sauce and shredded cheddar cheese. I put it in the oven for 5 minutes to melt the cheese and to crisp the bun slightly. When ready, I put diced onions on top. All in all... Very tasty and definitely something different.

This was a really tasty recipe. The cumin was a bit much so I'll cut back on that the next time.

I needed to use up the hotdogs in my fridge and my husband wanted something a little different then just ketchup and mustard on them, so I tried this. Big problem, I didn't have any meat. So I just made it minus the meat and...My husband loved it! He asks for this sauce (minus the meat) all the time for his hotdogs now! I'm not a fan, but then I don't like any hotdogs much. Definately making this often for my hubby, though!
