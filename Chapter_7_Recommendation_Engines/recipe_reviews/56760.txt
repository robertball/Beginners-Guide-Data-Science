I learned of this recipe from the newsletter on this site! Isn't it a great site? I love how it keeps all of us informed! Anyway, this recipe is great Doreen! :0) I made it with the same bread machine dough that I use for my Kraut Bierrocks from this site. Its very similar, just a difference in the condiments used. Thanks so much.

We really enjoyed this sandwich.  I had to use crescent roll dough because that is all I had.  I added some roasted green chili peppers and used 1 cup of sharp cheddar with 1 cup of Monterey Jack.
This sandwich is full of flavor and very filling.  Thanks Doreen!

I made this recipe with only two alterations. First, I added along with recipes ingredients, red bell peppers and some home-made Emeril's Essence.  Second, I used a cracked wheat bread recipe from King Arthur Flour, made in the dough cyle of my bread machine.  What resulted was a delicious comfort meal for a cold New England Winters' night! Served with a light fruit salad, yum.

Aweomse meal... reminds me of Shepherd pie so it goes well with lots of side vegetables.   I just love meat mixtures like this.  I added worcestershire sauce, and instead of using frozen dough i just put the mixture on top of bread slices along with some tabasco sauce.  Definitely making this one again.

Not terrible, but just okay. Rather bland, added some mustard and bbq to the stuffing to try to liven up the flavor. A very basic sloppy joe type sandwich... but in this house no one really cares for sloppy joes.

Had a difficult time finding this recipe.It would be helpful to name it with ingredients used. Finally found it on page 4 of cabbage!
Thanks for the recipe. Used to make one similar about 35 yrs ago and lost the recipe so this one helps.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and I keep getting asked when I am going to make it again.  Like others I used a dough recipe for my bread machine and it turned out great.

Good stuff. Husband likes to dip them in spicy mustard, while I actually think they go well with a little horseradish sauce. They freeze well too. Thanks, Doreen!

This is a tough recipe to rate/review.  My family did not care for them--their comment was not bad, but not really good.  The flavors were good together, but we just didn't care for them.  If you like Calzones, you'd probably like these.  This was just not a family favorite for us.

I used Simple Whole Wheat Bread from this site for the bread for these.  They turned out great!  Thanks.

I liked these.. pretty easy to make and they reheat well. Even though I seasoned the filling well, the blandness of the dough affected the recipe. I would suggest when you are rolling out the dough to sprinkle the dough with some seasoning so when you roll it out, it gets embedded in the dough..

Not worth the effort.  Quite bland.
