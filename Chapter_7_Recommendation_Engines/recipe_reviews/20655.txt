This dip was a HIT at my first catering party. I did an Hawaiian theme. I dug out a canteloupe and a grapefruit and placed the dip inside on the fruit tray and on the table.  The party guests were going mad trying to figure out how I made it. Hint: I mix it the same as I do when making pound cakes from scratch.  Let the cream cheese and cool whip get room temperature or soft. Blend those 2 first, then slowly add in white sugar, then slowly blend in brown sugar stopping to mash out any lumps with your fingers or a fork. Then add in your honey. This is a typical way to blend any type of ingredients with cream or butter. Try slicing open a pineapple or any large fruit and filling it with the dip.  Presentation is everything!! Enjoy it!!!

Its a really good dip and its easy to make.  I did, however, have a really hard time getting the cream cheese to blend completely.  Putting it in a blender would be a wise idea.

I made a fruit tray for a potluck dinner at work and made this dip. Everyone loved it and kept asking me for the recipe. The only changes I made were I bought an 8 oz container of whipped soft cream cheese. Wonderful!

I made this for a 4th of July party and served it with strawberries. It was devoured. Because some people had problems with lumps, I followed this procedure:
1. I mixed everything except the Cool Whip in my electric mixer until creamy.
2. I added Extra Creamy Cool Whip (instead of whipped cream) at the end.
It was nice and smooth.

Excellent!  I made this for Thanksgiving and added some food coloring to make it more festive.  I plan to make it again for Christmas and add red food coloring.  I let the cream cheese warm up to room temperature and it mixed fine. Tasted great with apples, strawberries, pineapple, grapes....

This is a great fruit dip!  The maple syrup and brown sugar make a yummy variation.  My one suggestion is to put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor to blend.  It is faster and easier.

All my friends are begging me for this recipe.  I doubled the recipe, and added
a bit more brown sugar to shake the "cream cheese" taste.  But other than that,
it was a hit!

This recipe is very easy to prepare and wonderful too!  I followed some of the other reviews and only put the brown sugar in.  Without the white sugar it has just enough sweetness to enhance fruit instead of overpower.  Thank you!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. It was good, but there are better fruit dips out there. Besides it being an unappealing brownish color, the consistency is not the greatest either. I would try other recipes first.

Although this recipe has a nice light flavor, it was lumpy from the cream cheese.  I let the cheese come to room temperature to soften, placed in a bowl and *tried* to blend until smooth with the other ingredients.  It was a named brand cheese and it did not blend well.  I ended up with pea-sized cream cheese bits in the dip.  When I make this again, I will try to whip the cream cheese *alone* before adding the other ingredients.

I made this for my daughters volleyball team.  Unbelievable how fast it disappeared.  Every mom wanted the recipe.  Now I am lovingly stuck making this for every tournament!!  All natural ingred. are a plus.  The marshmallow cream in the other recipes was a huge turn off.

I made this for my family to celebrate New Year's Eve - it was a perfect late-night snack with fresh fruit.  It was a bit too sweet for our tastes so I added some extra sour cream to cut the sweetness.  It was awesome!

Best fruit dip ever - people always ask me to make this for their parties/events. I don't usually add the maple syrup as we hardly ever have it in the house but it's still great!

I made this fruit dip to accompany a fruit platter I made for a birthday at my wife's office.  No ingredients were changed or omitted from the recipe.  It was made verbatim.  The dip turned out to be delicious and refreshing, and everyone at my wife's office loved it.  No fruit was left from fairly large platter.  One might think from looking at the ingredients that it might be overly sweet but the cream cheese nicely  balances the sweetness of the marshmallow cream, whipped topping, sugar, and maple syrup.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm still on the fence with this fruit dip.  I had good comments, but not sure whether people were just being nice.  Also, the directions leave readers too much interpretation with method.  I whipped 1 cup whipping cream and folded in to rest of ingredients which were combined and whipped until smooth and light.  I added some lemon zest for a little extra flavor and as other reviewers suggested, omitted the white sugar.

This recipe was GREAT. I make it every time I have company over. It tastes great with homemade tortilla chips. Just sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on flour tortillas and bake for about 7 minutes. A great appetizer or dessert.

I was looking for a fruit dip without marshmellow creme and this one is fantastic! Major YUM! I omitted the white sugar (you really don't need it) and added a sprinkle of cinnamon.

This dip is incredible!! I followed this recipe exactly, but not in the order specified. I brought the cream cheese to room temperature and mixed in the sour cream. Then I beat in the white sugar until it was fluffy. Then I added the brown sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla. At this point it looks a little runny...but finally you add in the whipped cream (I used cool whip) and it all comes together in a fluffy maddness of wonderful fruit dip!!! I've made this twice now in two days...my friends and I just can't get enough!! THANK YOU for the recipe!! :-)

This was a bust. I had to throw it away. Thank goodness I had Annie's fruit Salsa receipe as a back up just in case. I am a good baker but I might have made an error, the directions were not clear. Should I have whipped the whipping cream first? I just poured it in the mixer. It curdeled. The taste was light and no big deal. I think the standered fruit dip of equal parts of marshmellow fluff with cream cheese is much better.

Very good! I order to cut calories I used yoghurt instead of sour cream and reduced the amount of whipped cream. Also added brown sugar instead of white sugar and more maple syrup. Served it with chopped almonds on the top.

I first had this dip when a friend made it at her daughter's birthday party. It was great to have a yummy condiment to go with the beautiful fresh fruit she had displayed. Everyone asked her where she got the recipe, including me. I was happy to find it here and will use it many times, I'm sure.

Love this dip!  Made it in my blender.  Used 3/4 a carton of Cool Whip instead of whipped cream and added a little extra maple syrup.  Mixed the sour cream in with the other ingredients instead of putting on top.  This made it a little thinner, but also allowed me to blend it smooth without the cream cheese and Cool Whip being completely softened.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is awsome. Exactly what you would expect from a fruit dip, better than the premade stuff you can buy in a grocery store. It's not too sweet and it looks really pretty if you sprinkle a little cinnamon on top once you've put it in the serving dish.

This dip has a light-brown colour. For me, the dip may be thicker; it was a little runny.(even after chilling)
I didn't have maple syrup, so I used golden syrup.
My guests really liked the taste. We served it with fruit(I like apples with it) and amaretto cake after dinner, and it looked like we had a children-party!
Next time I will try another recipe, but who knows, maybe I will return to this one!

This is the fruit dip that I make, this is a very good version for fruit dip with the maple syrup...it makes it so much better than so many of the recipes for fruit dip...I think this will always be the fruit dip recipe that I use.  This is a keeper.

I messed this up and it was still a hit. I forgot it was 1 cup of whip cream and I added a whole container of cool whip. Too thin but still tasted like a good combination of ingredients. I also added a little red food coloring to take away from the brown. Next time I'll do it right and it will be great.

This is the second time I have used this recipe. The reviews were again astounding! I agree that using a 1/2 a tablespoon make this less overwhelming and lets this dip enhance the flavor of the fruit served with it.

A great surprise! Doubled the recipe for a party, and served it in a hollowed out honeydew shell. Guests loved this so much and almost all asked what was in it. I did cut out the white sugar completely, made up for it in a little extra brown sugar and maple syrup, and added about a half-lemon's worth of zest before chilling and that REALLY punched up the flavor. Served it with strawberries, pineapple, red and green apples, bananas and melon. Tasted best with the apples, bananas and strawberries.

This was really good. I took the advice of others and added the cool whip last.  Also, I didn't care too much for the color, and I think that it is why my baby wouldn't try it. She won't touch anything that's weird looking. So, I think next time I will add a few drops of red food coloring for prettiness.  Also, I didn't make mine low fat, but I think I will make it again and use fat free sour cream and cream cheese and the light cool whip and see how it tastes. Then, I could have it anytime instead of just for a special occassion.  Thank you for a good recipe.

This dip is DELICIOUS! I used commercially purchased whipped topping and folded it in gently as the last step. It was light and fluffy. Everyone at the party raved about it. I used the shell of the pineapple I served with it as a bowl to serve it in. Inexpensive and very nice presentation surrounded by a variety of colorful fruits. Thanks, Bonnie!

This was delicious and a big hit with my Bunko group. I thought the strawberries would go fast, but the apples were the favorite of all the fruits I put out for dipping. I will definitely make this again.

This is actually a great start to a wonderful dip for any fruits. I did make a few simple changes/alterations. First, as anyone who has ever made a cheesecake knows you must must must use room temp cream cheese and CREAM the cream cheese with the sugar before you add ANY other ingredients to ensure there are no lumps in your end result. Next this recipe is obviously for those with a sweet tooth. All you need to do to take down the sugar is simply to whip your own "Whipped Cream". I do not think the chef was implying using Cool Whip but instead plain heavy cream that has been "Whipped" i.e. Whipped CREAM. Especially since Cool Whip or store bought whipped creams have added sugar AND vanilla in them already.......Just some thoughts from an old lady who loves to cook/bake

Been making this dip for years, the whole family loves it and it compliments the fruit beautifully.  I always use cool whip instead of whipped cream and use the whole container full so it doesn't go to waste.  I use the mixer with the whip attachment to mix all the ingredients except the cool whip first, then whip in the cool whip last until just mixed in.  Never have lumps and the dip stays  light and fluffy.

This dip was great!! Best fruit dip I've had. My guest stood around eating it, trying to figure out what was in it that made it soooo good. I used whipped cream cheese and added a bit extra cool whip and it came out perfect. Very easy to make and tastes good days later.

Loved the flavor of this dip!  The trick to getting the cream cheese smooth...pop it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds(if you don't have time to wait for room temp).  It should blend smoothly then.  The only changes I made were using low fat versions of cream cheese, cool whip, and sour cream....all the flavor...less guilt! ;)

This recipe is good and turns out very tasty for how simple it is. I usually put the dip in the blender to make it creamier, then put it in the freezer until it's time to serve. My guests always love it!

I made this for my son's birthday and it was a hit!  Everyone sat around the plate and ate all of it.  I served it with strawberries and apples.  I used cool whip and put it in my big mixer and it was great.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I didn't soften the cream cheese enough and I had some chunks.  It would have tased better without chunks of cream cheese.  I used a beater and that made it nice and fluffy.

This was yummy. I made it for my sisters bridal shower and I had many people ask for the recipe. Needless to say, the dip was all gone. So I didnt get to take any home.

Did not like this as a fruit dip - too dense and creamy - worked out much better as a bagel spread.  I had to toss it out, because my guests did not eat it again after one try  :-(

Excellent recipe as a base. Be sure to cream the cream cheese and the sour cream first. I didn't use the brown sugar, but instead I used white bakers' sugar which is very fine and mixes well. I added the sugar a little at a time and tasted it to be sure it was not too sweet. I also used strawberry flavored extract instead of the vanilla. At the end I used a little pure maple syrup. My Super Bowl party guests could not get enough of it!

Wow, my mouth is still recovering from this sweet treat!  Absolutely delicious, easy to make and will be a hit at this years Christmas eve party.  Thanks Bonnie!  I adjusted this to be diabetic friendly by replacing 1/2 the whipped cream with fat free, Splenda sweetened vanilla yoghurt, replaced the sugars with brown sugar twin and Splenda and the maple syrup with Aitkens maple flavored syrup.  A bit too sweet perhaps, so will have to work on the substitutions a bit more. Oh, I also halved the added vanilla due to the flavoured yoghurt and used stawberry cream flavoured low fat cream cheese.  My oh my oh my....

This was really wonderful!  I almost didn't try it because I am not always fond of things with maple syrup as a seasoning.  I'm so glad that I didn;t let that stop me.  I served with a fruit platter for my book club and everyone loved it.

Once you try this dip you will NEVER buy store bought again, it is wonderful...I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!  I used whipped cream cheese, and I omitted the white sugar and just used light brown.  I took another reviewers advice and mixed the cream cheese and sour cream at room temperature.  Additionally, I used pure maple syrup (makes a huge difference) instead of just regular pancake syrup!

Delicious!  After reading the other reviews, I only added 1/2 tsp of maple syrup.  According to another reviewer they changed the order of adding the ingredients and I followed that one with adding the whipped cream last.

Nice and creamy.  However the maple flavor was a little overpowering.  Just add it last a little at a time.

Really nice flavor!  I used whipped cream cheese, lite cool whip, and sugar-free maple syrup.  It whipped up easily and smoothly just using a fork!

I have made this twice recently for two different events and everyone just loved it when paired with fresh cut fruit and berries.  I did modify the recipe to not include the white sugar. Really was not necessary with the brown sugar as it was sweet enough.  My family loved it and both times I served folks were asking for the recipe!

I was also looking for a fruit dip without marshmallow crème.  This one is fabulous!  I made sure my cream cheese was nice and soft, beat in the sour cream and brown sugar until smooth.  I did not add the white sugar as others had suggested.  Then added the maple syrup and vanilla.  For the whipped cream I beat 1 cup of cream with a tsp. of vanilla and a 1/4 cup powdered sugar until it had stiff peaks and then measured out one cup of it to fold into the fruit dip.  It was an ugly pale brown color (think onion soup) so I added 7 drops of red food coloring.  Next time I will add the coloring when I mix in the sour cream and brown sugar so it has a really nice uniform color.  Nice and fluffy, but not airy.  Perfectly sweet.  Delicious!!

This fruit dip is very good.  Goes with any fruit and is always enjoyed by guests.  Once made, I usually freeze half of the dip for later use, because I find that it is too much for one sitting.

This dip is REALLY Good, but not with fruit!  I give it 3 stars because of the title.  I think it should be a bagel spread.  I personally like a more refreshing dip, like one mixed with concentrated orange juice.  I thought that the brown sugar and syrup took away from the taste of the strawberries.  It looks like onion dip (I would add food coloring if serving guests) I will use this batch as bagel spread or frosting for a rich cake.
