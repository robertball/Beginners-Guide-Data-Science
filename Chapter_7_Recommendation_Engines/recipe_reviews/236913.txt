The only change that I made was I used onion powder instead of onion salt because I didn't have any. And it's best to put on hot fries. Very good seasoning. Thanks.

I'll make this again for sure! I used garlic and onion powder and salt as well as the paprika. It made the fries taste like the wedges from the real Canadian superstore!
