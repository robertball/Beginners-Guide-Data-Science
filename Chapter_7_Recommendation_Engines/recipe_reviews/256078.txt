Easy and delicious! I used Peppermint Oreos (available in December) and sprinkled crushed peppermint candies on top. These were a huge hit with my family.

These are very good and easy.  I made them for a ladies lunch and they all disappeared qickly.  The filling has a slight doughy taste.  I think I might make them with mint flavored oreos or add a flavoring next time.

Easy and delicious!! Gourmet Dessert Chef status!

We did 2 batches for a friends Christmas game night. Birthday Cake (Chocolate) Oreos for first batch. Winter Oreos for second batch.

Dipped each batch half in white almond bark and half in chocolate almond bark. My husband add some sprinkles on top of each after I dipped them!

Second year making these and they were just as much a hit as before. Making the cookie is super easy, but the coating is still an issue for me. I microwave melted the white chocolate last year and found it cooled down too quickly. I melted it and kept it on the stove this year and that seemed to work for a bit longer...it still seized up and I had to start with fresh. Next year smaller batches of chocolate and get faster, I guess.
Also, milk chocolate seemed to not really set...I have those in the frig. Still yummy though.

These are wonderful. My family loved them and if you want a taste, put one or  two away while you are making them, or you will not get one. Changed nothing.
