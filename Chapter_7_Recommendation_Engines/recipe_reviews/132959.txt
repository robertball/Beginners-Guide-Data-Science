I doubled this recipe and froze the ham, chicken and swiss.  The first batch was really runny, but tasted great.  For the second batch, I put some uncooked rice underneath the chicken, ham, cheese and soup mixture.  The rice soaked up all of the juices and was super yummy.  I think it would work well with stuffing mix as well.

okay, way too much work for a casserole for me and too runny.  I did like the flavour... so I've just made this again with many alterations.  Instead of all the messy egg/milk wash and breading in all that oil, I just quickly stirfry the chicken plain in an oil sprayed pan,then add the cooked chicken cubes with the cubed ham & cubed cheese in the dish, pour the soup over & I used sour cream like another reviewer said, then topped with a bread crumb topping mix of crushed bread crumbs & a couple of crushed ritz (2 or 3 only)  My family liked this but I really liked how easy it was - especially if you've got all the cubes done earlier!  thanks for a good base!

I really liked it! I also took the advise of the others and used 2 cans of soup...and I cut the milk down to 1/2 cup. Sprinkled bread crumbs on top as well. Mine was not too runny or mushy-it was just right!

My Family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  those it was a little involved, It turned out really tasty.  I did make a few adjustments.  I coated the chicken cubes in Italian bread crumbs.  I also added chopped onions when browning the chicken.  Instead of the 1 cup of milk, I used 1/2 Cup and a 1/2 cup sour cream.  It was not too runny for us.  Just a nice sauce.  I just mine  over white rice.  My hubby thought it would be better with little red potatoes so I will try that next time.  I will surely make this again.

I will make this recipe again.  It was very very easy.  Next time I may add another cream of Chicken and Milk Mixture and cut my chicken into smaller chunks.  Though for a tasty and easy recipe, also one for potlucks... I am placing this in my file.

This was great!  I was always "afraid" of making chicken cordon bleu the regular way, because I have trouble getting the chicken cooked all the way thru without being dry, so this was a good caserole to try for me.  My whole family enjoyed it, with only a small portion left for my 9 year old to pack it in his thermos for lunch the next day.  This is a keeper in my recipe box thanks for sharing!

so, my husband loved this. i made a couple of changes- i added some flour and parsley to the bread crumbs, i only used 1/2 a cup of milk with the canned soup, i used mozzarella cheese, i precooked the ham a little to remove some moisture, i baked it shallow in a large dish for 1 hour. it was creamy and looked great. it was really pretty for a casserole. i am adding it to my rotation of husband pleasing recipes.

after reading all the reviews i decided to not switch things but make it more for my family.  we are trying to eat healthier now so we did not coat and fry the chicken.  we just cooked the chicken in the pan and then cubed it up. because ham is a natura water "holder" i quickly cooked the ham in a pan first to drain most of the water out of it.  i used low sodium cream of chicken soup.  i put 1/2 cup of milk with the soup instead of 1 cup.  i put 1/2 cup cheese in the mix and 1/2 cup on top.  then coverd with a small amount of breadcrumbs.  the casserole was not runny at all and tasted very good!  the only complaint i have it that this recipe says for 8 people.  i have a family of 4.  my husband and daughter eat quite a bit and this casserole only covered the 4 of us. depending on what you call a serving size, i would double up on the ingredients if you have more than 4 people in your family.  thanks to everyone who put in suggestions!!

I would really give this a 4 1/2 stars.  My family loved it.  I have a picky eater and she had seconds.  The only reson for the 4 1/2 stars is it was runny.  I will add another can of cream of something to thinkin it up.  I will make this again and try adding cream of mushroom or something. Thank you for this new addition to my menu

When I made this dish it was too runny. The flavor was good. I'm not sure that I will try it again.

This is my husband's favorite recipe.  To make it quicker, use 2 lbs. frozen chicken nuggets instead of breading your own.

I did like this recipe but found it a little salty.  Next time I might use fat free Cream of Chicken or reduced sodium Cream of chicken if they have it.  I used 2 cans of soup and 1 cup of milk as others suggested.  Also, I didn't want to deep fry the chicken, baked the pieces in a 400F oven for 15 minutes.  It might not have been as crunchy, but I still thought it tasted really good.  Will make it again.  Served it with baked baby potatoes, my husband and my 1 year old loved it.

I liked the flavor of this recipe, but the texture wasn't what I was going for.  The crispy breading on the chicken became soggy while baking, and most of it fell off the chicken.  This recipe hasn't been a total loss, however.  I've since breaded whole chicken breasts and fried, then set aside and prepared the rest of the ingredients as a sauce on the stove to pour over the chicken.  This is actually faster, as the sauce is ready as soon as all the cheese is melted, instead of 30 minutes in the oven.  Thanks for helping me find a great alternative to the time-consuming hassle of Chicken Cordon Bleu.

This was great, everyone loved it. I made changes including a few tablespoons of dijon mustard, stirfried the bare-not-breaded chicken, used sliced swiss over the casserole and under a buttered cracker crumb top. Due to the "runny" comments, I started the casserole with a layer of rice and the whole thing turned out perfect. Its a keeper, thank you.

This is so delicious and easier than pounding the chicken breasts thin enough to roll.  I took the other readers advice and used two cans of soup and about 3/4 cup of milk, just the right amount of sauce, thanks Wanda!!

Anything that my picky husband likes gets 5 stars from me! Very simple.  The only difference is I don't bread the chicken. A good comfort food~

This is a pretty decent base recipe. I took suggestions of many -- added cooked rice in pan bottom; thyme, garlic powder, parmesean cheese in chicken coating; added 2 tbsp mayo to egg wash to thicken; plus I used turkey ham instead of regular ham. It still could use a little extra flavor but havent decided what the addition will be. Thanks!

I just made some for my girlfriend who had her first baby, easy for her to eat, and to make if she wants to repeat. copied the recipe for her along with a casserole dish for a gift.

Very salty and does not taste like cordon bleu. I made it twice changing the recipes to make it less salty but it was still too salty for my taste. Will probably not make again.

I also cut back the milk and add another can of soup.  Kids like it.  Will make again.  Prep time took a little longer as I cooked each cut up breast separately for better browning.  It also was a bit salty, may have been the extra soup and ham.  May need a little tweaking to tone this down.

This was very good. I did cheat a little by using frozen chicken nuggets thawed (just to save time). They worked great.

I thought this was great.  I used slices of Cheese and Slices of ham instead of cubes. Next time I will make sure to up the ham.  The hole family loved it.  We didnt think it was too runny at all. I put the chicken on the bottom then layed the slices of Ham and then slices of cheese then poured the chicken soup mixture over the top.  Thank you so much for the Recipe we will be making this again for sure...

This recipe has been a favorite since the first time I made it.  My husband doesn't like swiss so I used cheddar and panko flakes instead of bread crumbs.  It still tastes awesome!

This was just ok for me. I probably wouldn't make it again. If you make the chicken like the recipe call for and don't use frozen nuggets, this seemed like it was actually more work than just making Chicken Cordon Bleu. I would rather stick with the real thing. If I could think of one thing that would make it better for me would be to use something other than bread crumbs to coat the chicken. Maybe more of a traditional flour based breading would have made a difference.

I used frozen popcorn chicken instead of fresh chicken, and kept everything else the same. Turned out great and made for an easy dinner!

The whole family (3 kids under age 7) loved it! I used a ham from Costco and made several batches for the freezer.

This recipe is kick-butt! The first time I made it, it came out a little runny so I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut the milk to 1/2 c. and used 2 cans of soup instead of one. One other thing I did differently was layer the bottom of my pie dish with green peas-- it came out perfect! My husband does a little dance everytime I ask him if he wants this on the menu for the week :) Thank you for sharing!

Delicious recipe.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I substituted cream of mushroom and whole milk and it still turned out great.  I also took the advice of an earlier posting and used a combination of gruyere and swiss.  Excellent.   I will be making this again.

I skipped the breading and frying part.  I just stir-fried the chicken and then tossed it in with the ham and cheese.  I halved the milk and added half cup sour cream.  This was very good served over rice.

This recipe was great! I did cook all the ingredients over butter noodles and I did use two cans of the cream of chicken. My husband, who is really picky, even had a second serving. Will make again :)

Very good!  Everyone liked it, even the kids; 5 and 3.  Simple, easy and fast.  Great for days when you need a good quick meal, and it's also flexible.  I used a little less chicken and a little more ham because of what we had available, and I'm sure it's great no matter the measurements.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be reusing this one!

this was awesome BUT very high in fat.  These are the changes I made... use precooked chicken breast and do not bread and fry it. Add the 6 to 8 serving size of pre cooked brown rice to the bottom of the casserole dish then add all the remaining ingredients. Use low fat soup and cheese.

This was delicious and very easy. I used store bought,premade chicken nuggets and left over ham from the Slow Cooker Ham recipe also on this web site. I used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c sour cream with cream of mushroom soup. Three out of four in our family loved this! I will definitely make it again.

Wow! This is definitely going in my recipe box. My kids LOVE chicken cordon bleu but we barely have it (with 5 kids it is expensive)but this was a major big hit with 3 out of 5 of them so that rules at my table!!! I did the half and half milk and sour cream like others said and also made a WAY bigger batch - and we still have hardly any leftovers. And I don't understand the "too runny" at all. This was thick, creamy and delicious!!

This was ok; everyone ate it, altho they didn't *rave* per say about it. I did make changes...wanted some carb, so I started with a layer of flat noodles, and mixed half of the milk/soup mixture with them. Then layered chicken, ham and cheese. Added some seasoning to the rest of the milk/soup mixture and poured over. Then crushed a couple of handfuls of cheezits to give it some crunch. Use reduced-sodium cream chicken - it wasn't too salty at for me. Thanks - will use again, but will adjust with some add'l seasonings.

I made some changes, subbing 1 cup sour cream for the milk (to thicken it up), put some seasonings in the "breadcrumbs" and used two cans of cream of chicken. It was pretty good with those alterations, however, if you are scared away by the appearance of your food, this recipe is not for you. Tastes pretty good though. NOT as good as the real thing, but definitely easier to make!!!

This recipe is not only easy but the taste is wonderful!  I used fat free chicken soup to reduce the calories.  I also took the advice of another and used two cans of soup.  Thanks Wanda, this is definetely a keeper.

I used shaved ham, sliced cheese, and canned chicken.  Did the soup, milk, and sour cream thing.  I greased the baking pan, then laid down seasoned bread crumbs, the slices of Swiss chees, then shaved ham, then canned chicken.  Repeated in two layers topped with crumbs and cheese.  Was amazing good and easy!  The cheese next to the crumbs on the bottom layer baked into a nice chewy/crispy feature.  I wanted to see how many corners I could cut and still have it taste reputable.  Haha.  It's works.  :)

I don't get the canned soup part, nor the point of breading the chicken prior. It adds so much more sodium to the dish where the ham is salty enough.  I flash fry the chicken and ham , pour it in casserole dish, toss it a bit with a few tablespoons of flour -- along with warmed milk it will thicken on its own when baked. I add mushrooms (pre-rendered so not to add more liquid)and top with buttered bread crumbs --  it is gorgeous, creamy, cheesy and flavorful.

Great basis! I was lucky enough to have frozen, pre-breaded chicken breasts that I could fry so that saved a huge step in prep. Instead of 1 cup of milk, I used about 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup white wine, and 1/4 cup sour cream. Yummy, yummy - we'll do this again and thanks for the recipe!!

This is good but if you are like me and don't normally fry, you won't like the smell of the chicken frying.

My husband absolutely loves this casserole. I have made it a few times and I make it exactly as the recipe states. My only gripe is that it is very time consuming for a casserole, but since he loves it, I will continue to make it.

My family loved this casserole.  I made it exactly per the recipe the first time, but thought cooking the chicken was exhausting, I hate to babysit food.  So the next dozen or so times we've had it, I was lazy and took frozen chicken nuggets, heated them in the microwave and cut them in fours.  The kids nor I knew the difference.  As a single Mom with 5 kids in the house, I'm all about simple and quick.  Thanks for the recipe

So, my one main issue was the bread crumbs. I think it might have been dipping it in the egg/milk wash that made the coating all fall off into the oil in the skillet. I used italian-style bread crumbs but it didn't really matter because it all fell off in the skillet. I did add fresh ground pepper to the soup mixture before I poured it over the casserole ingredients. I added one personal touch--one box StoveTop Savory Herb stuffing over the top, then I drizzled 1/4 cup of butter over the top. This is sitting in my fridge now waiting for my husband to bake it at dinnertime, as I'll be at work. I'll update my review tomorrow, once I hear how they liked it. EDITED: Mixed reviews. They didn't love it but they didn't hate it either.

This was okay.  I added thyme and parmesan cheese to the breading mixture.

This recipe is fantastic but you have to eat it immediately! It does not refrigerate well and it makes terrible leftovers. I don't like the pungent taste of deli swiss cheese, so I substituted Gruyère. It's a little more expensive, but it's much milder.

My family loves this.  I've made this quite a few times and it comes out good every time.  It is a bit time consuming breading and frying all those small pieces of chicken but the end result is really good.

I JUST made this today for dinner, and was unsure what the husband (who's not a casserole fan) and two picky kids would have to say.  But i figured i would give it a try as we all love chicken cordon bleu but the husband (who usually makes it) hates making it.  Well, when i took it out of the oven the kids came in and said "smells good like regular chicken cordon bleu" so with high hopes i plated it up.  Both kids and the husband liked it and said i could definitely make it again.  I love finding something they ALL like that i can add to my recipe box.  One note:  I took the advice of a lot of reviewers and cut the milk that i mixed with the soup down to 1/2 a cup from 1 cup.  This turned out beautifully, it was not runny at all and tasted fantastic, AND i ran out of bread crumbs but had a bag of seasoned salad croutons in the cupboard that i smashed into crumbs and coated the rest of the chicken with.  It worked great!  So if you like chicken cordon bleu definitely give this a try, i don't think you'll be disappointed.

Very good, I grilled the chicken and then added some frozen peas and only used 3/4 cup milk.  Was a little watery so will prob use less milk or more soup next time.

I added potatoes to mine to have something else in the casserole to absorb some of the juices and flavors. It was very good! Breading the chicken does seem like a lot of work for an otherwise simple casserole, so I may skip that next time and just do a crumb topping like some other reviewers have suggested.

Pretty good.  Threw all the ingredients in the casserole dish and topped with bread crumbs and baked.  Served with brown rice.  With the rice it was very filling and tasty.  Easy and quick.

This is really good. I read the reviews before I made this recipe. So I used the two cans of cream of chicken and instead of using milk I used 3/4 can of heavy cream and 2 Tbs. of sour cream. It made the sauce perfect. This one is a keeper in my recipe collection.

The fix. Do the chicken cubes right up to the point where you add the milk and soup. Stop right there. Boil up some linguini, prepare the soup in a separate pot with only 1/2 cup of milk to create a thick sauce. While that's doing, put the chicken cubes, ham and swiss under the broiler to melt the cheese and serve with the linguini covered with the thickened soup. Nice crispy chicken and all the flavor of a faux cordon bleu.

This was really good, but it seemed to be missing something. I used 2 cans of soup and added cooked rice. The texture was excellent; no need to reduce the milk. I also sauteed the ham with a chopped onion before putting it in the casserole dish.

This does taste like chicken cordon bleu but I won't make again.  As a casserole it's just too heavy or something; can't describe it.  I don't care what anyone thinks or says but it is a thousand times easier (and less mess) to make traditional chicken cordon bleu.

This was so good. The chicken is so juicy. It has a lot of sauce so you could make rice to serve it over if you like, but tasted awesome by itself. This is a winner for sure.

Very easy recipe that turned out very good. One point of interest is that I tried a suggestion to put rice on the bottem of the casserole. For anyone new to cooking as I am, use instant rice. After scraping off the top of the dish to avoid the uncooked rice at the bottem it turned into a very nice meal.

I just made this last night when I screwed up pounding out my chicken for traditional cordon bleu. Instead of a cream soup (which I didn't have!), I made white sauce with a hint of Dijon and added the Swiss cheese to the sauce. I did not bread the chicken first, but sauteed in an olive oil and butter blend and drained on paper towels. I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much, except I sprinkled a good dose of buttered bread crumbs on the top of the casserole.. not too bad!! Overall, the idea of this recipe saved dinner. I served this with sauteed broccoli spears and roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

My children loved this receipe as is.  Did not need to change a thing.  I did use strips of chicken breasts instead of cubes, that might have made a difference in the runniness others have mentioned.  This will go in my rotation of meals.

This was really good.  Rich flavor, and very much like chicken cordon bleu.  I subbed an equal amount of sour cream for the milk and then threw in a dash of milk (because it looked too thick).  The sour cream added a slight tang (still yummy) and made the end-product consistency perfect to serve over mashed potatoes.  Next time I might toss some extra bread crumbs on top before baking because it looked somewhat unappealing when it came out of the oven.  (Still tasted great, though!)  Thank you!

I made this a couple weeks ago for my husband and myself.  I did not fry the chicken pieces with breadcrumbs, but just browned them in a little EVOO.  I mixed everything together, and it WAS a little runny like others have commented, but I would add sour cream next time to prevent that.  Otherwise, this was AWESOME!  We both loved it and it's going on the monthly rotation list.  Thank you!!

Thank you Wanda!!! This has to be the BEST recipe that I have tried from here. The only thing that I did differant, was to season the bread crumbs with garlic powder, used turkey ham, and add 1 more can of cream of chicken soup. My husband, and my 3 year old, who are very picky eaters both had seconds!!

i loved this dish, but it IS rich. i  used 2 cans of soup, which i would do again, but i also used a little extra cheese, which i won't do again. i'm also not convinced the last cup of milk is necessary, but i'll have to do a little more experimenting. great for  hungry roomates ;)

I made this for a friend with a new baby. I didn't actually taste it- but she gave it rave reviews and asked for the recipe. It was very easy to make and smelled delicious! I will make this again for my family!

This was good. I would have liked some more "stuff" in it though. It seemed like it was missing some veggies (peas, mushrooms, or broccoli would be nice) or at the very least, some noodles. If I make it again, I'll probably monkey with it some and see what I can come up with. As written, it's good, but lacking something.

my hubby really liked this.  I did add a sprinkle of parsley to the egg/milk mix.  Next time I will add some pasta to the casserole too.

To add texture and color, I added in a bag of frozen broccoli and diced potatoes. With my additions, this hot dish transformed into a delicious well rounded meal!

only things I changed were to add 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1/2 cup milk - too runny and way too salty - nothing to hold it together - also frying up all those chicken cubes was more work and grease than I wanted to deal with

I like chicken cordon bleu and I love comfort food, but this was not at all what I expected. I was really looking forward to it, from all the good reviews, but I will not be making it again. To save some calories, I did not bread and fry the chicken, simply sauted it in a pan with a small amount of olive oil. Kept everything else the same, although I did add a bit of fresh thyme. Overall, this is way too salty and lacking in flavor. In some weird twist, my uber picky 13 year old stepson, who would try to live off plain white rice and dry ham sandwiches if we let him, actually liked this....although he was the only one out of five.

This is by far the best casserole I have ever made.  i would recommend not making any adjustments to it.  I have fixed this for years and it is a family favorite.  great dish with a side of mixed veggies, rolls, and a cheesecake for dessert!

I did it differently. I didn't fry anything instead I mixed the ham, chicken and 2 cans of cream of chicken and filled one can with milk so it was thicker.
Then I poured that in a pan layered it with swiss cheese and topped with bread crumbs. I don't like frying because of the added calories. We all loved it.

Love this recipe! I've been making casseroles a lot lately because they're an easy left over to heat up and this is definitely my favorite so far. The only thing I did DIFFERENT was I put a layer of cooked white rice in the bottom of the casserole dish before baking and it took care of the problem that other people were talking about as far as it being too runny.

This is 5 stars with reviewers changes.  I halved this recipe and cooked it in a casserole dish.  I used 1 egg & 1/4 cup whole milk for egg wash.  I used 3/4 cup of italian bread crumbs.  4 oz of swiss cheese.  I used half milk and half sour cream.  It was not runny at all.  It actually looked very appetizing unlike the picture above.

I probably shouldn't rate this at all, as I made this because my daughter loves Chicken Cordon Blue, and I figured she would enjoy it.  She did. It's just not my thing though.  It would probably be popular at a potluck supper.

Great easy way to make cordon blue with basically the same flavor but in a casserole dish! My husband loved it and he is picky, but I mad a few small changes. I used thin sliced ham cut up and pan fried to add a little extra texture and flavor. I used provolone cheese and cut down the milk by about half like others suggested. It turned out great and I will be makig this again!

I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup sour cream as others have suggested, but I found it to be a little dry. Next time I will bake it over rice and use a full cup of milk and possibly 2 cans of soup.

Sloppy? Yes. Delicious? Yes.  I did the breaded chicken part. However, I cooked some non-breaded chicken chunks with onion and garlic in a skillet. Added that to the baking dish. Put in 10 oz of swiss plus about 4 oz of Velveeta because I had it on hand.   With about 10 minutes left in the bake time I added a layer of raw/dry package stuffing for crunch. Perfect.   Getting up for thirds now.

I totally cheated on this one. I used 20 breaded chicken tenders and cooked them ahead. While they were cooking I chopped up the ham and cheese. Making sure to cut everything about the same size. I also try and make sure that all the pieces are evenly dispersed cause I don't like big huge chunks of cheese all clumped together. I used a 9 x 13 pan since the size wasn't mentioned.  I used half fat-free sour cream and half milk, like others have suggested. I did not have the problem of this being too runny, infact it could have helped to be runny since I served this over bow tie pasta. Would have made for more sauce that way. This  barely fed 5 people. No way 8 people would be happy with the portion size. Make sure to use low sodium chicken soup. Super easy to do and throw together, especially with the breaded chicken tenders.

I made this last night for dinner, and my sweet hubby couldn't stop eating it!  In fact, he begged me to make it again.  I did modify the recipe.  I used  a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the ckix kind, left out the ham, added 1/2 a sautéed red onion and used 2% cheese cubed.  Didn't need as much milk as the recipe called for, but I can't tell you how much I used exactly - just made sure it didn't look "soupy" before it went into the oven.  Will def add this one to the rotation!!

This was way too heavy for my taste. Frying the chicken and then layering it in cheese and creamy sauce made for a dish that was too heavy for dinner. I won't make it again.

This dish was very yummy!  Made a few changes to the original recipe - used an entire 16 oz. package of cubed ham and only half of the liquid recommended.  Came out beautifully, and leftovers to boot!

We love this recipe!  Requires a bit of work, but so worth it in the end.  I used shredded swiss instead of cubed and it made the swiss melt more evenly through the dish.

Nice flavors!  I have to agree with some other cooks, it was a bit too cheesy.  I think next time I'll reduce the amount of Swiss a bit.  Other, than that I'll be sure to make it again.  Thanks!

YUK!  WAAAY too much Swiss cheese!!  it was like chewing rubber! (I'm not a fan of Swiss cheese anyway...) Had good flavor but like another person said, it was very runny, took too much work and time for what the results were - seemed like something missing... needs to have noodles, rice or some kind of substance??  Very rich.  Don't think I'll be making this one again anytime soon.

I made this recipe this weekend (14Feb09) for my wife and another couple. It was leaps and bounds above great.  My guests told me I was in the wrong business. I should go to school to become a Chef. I felt guilty because the recipe was so easy and simple but it tasted like a complicated dish. Make this recipe and you will need a big pot to hold all the compliments.

My husband loves chicken cordon blue and I have never made it for him.  His mom always makes it for him.  So when I saw this recipe I thought I would try it.  It was so easy to make and my husband loved it.  He kept telling me how good it was.  I made some rice while the casserole was cooking.  Thank you so much we will eat again and again.

Excellent!!  Everyone loved it.. kids included.  I used sliced deli meat and just tore it up.  I also used cubed white cheddar and american cheese and reduced the milk to 1/2 cup.  The breaded chicken really makes this outstanding! A keeper!!

I thought this recipes turned out well; it was easy and tasty. I used chicken breast that I fryed whole and then cut up into chunks. I also used deli style cheese that I layered over the chunks. It was a quick meal!

I felt like chicken cordon bleu, but, was also feeling lazy. This was extremely salty. I like the idea, but, if you do make this, use low sodium soup and don't go crazy with the cheese. Husband ate it, I think out of pity. Will not make this again.

This is delicious! The only change I made was instead of cubing the cheese, I just added it to the top of the casserole, and added provolone cheese. It is now a regular in my house.

the first part is a little time consuming,so make sure you start early enough, or better yet, chop and coat the chicken ahead of time. all i had was italian bread crumbs, and it turned out great! my husband loved it. he had 3 plates.

the only thing i changed about this recipe is that I boiled my chicken then breaded, no frying. It was SOOOO good, even the kids LOVED it. Turned out perfect, which is awesome, because I hate to cook and am not very good in the kitchen, was very easy.

This recipe had good flavor, however, was a little runny. I will make this again, but will use less milk. I sprinkled salad crutons on the top before baking the casserole, these added a nice crunchy topping.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. I only added 1/2 of the milk called for to the soup, and seasoned it with "Nature's Season". I liked the consistency. I didn't have sour cream otherwise I would have added that also. I didn't like how salty it was, so I will add less ham next time. Another change I will make is to skip putting on the bread crumbs and frying the chicken.(This will cut out a lot of fat) I will finish it off by putting bread crumbs on the top of the casserole.

This was ok - not a big hit in my house. I did add 1/2 milk 1/2 sour cream as other suggested. It was a bit too salty with the condensed soup and ham - but I couldn't find the low sodium soup at my store. My husband doesn't like recipes made with condensed soup, so I am not too surprised that it didn't go over well in our house. I also didn't like the clean-up - too many dishes and the frying pan from the chicken. The pluses were the creaminess and the yummy swiss cheese.

This was YUMMY!I used some leftover ham and swiss from the deli, so I sliced it up rather than using chunks; it was still delicious. I mixed the cream of chicken soup with sour cream and chicken broth -- a strange combination but it was so creamy! We will definitely make this again!

My family loved this recipe!  I made quite a few changes as advised by others.  I used chicken strips, halfed the milk for the sauce and then added a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used pretty thick slices of ham and layered the chicken strips on the bottom with the ham going next and then I sprinkled a good portion of Mozzerella cheese on top of that and then last I topped with the sauce.  This was delicious!

Great Recipe!!!! Much easier than traditional Cordon Bleu, and tastes much better in my opinion!!!! I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it came out too greasy, though. Maybe I didn't drain the chicken enough.

I though the flavor was wonderful in this dish, a little greasy for me but my family loved it so I will make it again. You can prepare it the day before and then bake it off for 40 minutes. Be sure not to brown the chicken to much just a little. Great Dish

This turned out great,  although I modified the meat quantities to use less chicken and an equal amount of ham. I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top. I served it with a side of green beans and my family cleaned their plates! Very yummy. Prep time takes longer than stated.

Wonderful flavors! After reading reviews, I used soup and sour cream. It still was runny when I cut into it. Next time I make this I'll increase the Swiss cheese and pre-cook the cubed ham . Thank you for a wonderful alternative to trying to roll chicken around the filling.

This turned out so well that my very picky husband gave it a thumb's up and said I may make it again.  It is obviously much easier and less time consuming than making traditional Chicken Cordon Bleu.  Following suggestions, I only used 1/2 cup milk and it still had enough sauciness for the pasta I cooked  for a side dish.

Giving it four stars for the basic idea.  It was very tasty and easier  with my alterations. We try to avoid fried foods so used cooked chicken breast cut in chucks. As another reviewer said I used the bread crumbs as a topping but didn't really care for that. Next time I will leave them off or use a different topping. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good, filling casserole. I chose to brown the chicken instead of frying it and used the bread crumbs for a crust on top. I upped the amount of ham to 12 ounces, and I also used the half cup of sour cream, half cup of milk alteration many on here have recommended. Perfect consistency. I think I'll add some mushrooms next time to see if that makes it even better.

This was definitely a hit with my kids as they LOVE anything creamy with some crunch and cheese. The chicken was SO tender and moist and it really did taste like the real thing. Will definitely be making it again and again.

The sauce was runny and the flavor was bland.  I had high hopes for this recipe as I am a great fan of chicken cordon bleu, but I found this recipe to be a disappointment considering the amount of work involved.  I will not be making this again

Great basic idea, but I am lazy and took some shortcuts. I cut the chicken into 1 1/2 inch cubes, tossed them in a little olive oil, shook them in a plastic bag of bread crumbs and baked them until they were done. 
Lined the bottom of the dish with 1/2 inch uncooked rice then the ham, chicken, and cheese. Used 2 cans of soup and 1 cup of milk. Topped it with some crushed Ritz Crackers. There were no leftovers.

My family really loved this recipe. Even though it was a bit runny when following the directions, I have seen some great ideas to help with that. We love chicken cordon bleu and this casserole really delivers the flavor with ease. Thanks a bunch!

Thank you for this recipe. I did make modifications to use what I had on hand. I didn't have chicken breast but only grilled chicken strips. I ended up cubing the chicken and ham. Mixed the chicken, ham and cheese together with 1 can of soup and 3/4 can of milk. Threw it in the pan and put the bread crumbs on top. Family loved it!

Ttoo runny and too much work for a casserole for me. The taste was good, but the look and presentation of the dish was not good. 
Perhaps lining the bottom of the baking dish with instant rice would help to soak up some up the runny sauce and add another element besides meat and cheese....don't know if it's worth it to try though. Sorry!

OMG! This was soooo... good!  I followed the recipe verbatim other than using lowfat cream of chicken soup.  I didn't find breading the chicken to be any trouble at all.  This recipe was much easier than trying to wrap it all up inside a chicken breast and tastes just as good!  I highly recommend.  This recipe has been added to my Recipe Box.

This was ok, I might make it again if I'm short on time. I did as other posters suggested & mixed 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup sour cream.  It turned out a little more salty than I like, but that was probably from the ham and could be fixed.

My family fell in love with this recipe. I used butter instead of oil for frying the chicken, which really added a great taste-and I only used one stick.

Ok, anything that the girls say "This is good" gets a five star rating. The family absolutely loved it and I was told it is just as good cold as a leftover as it was hot. I cheated. I used prepackaged diced ham and cubed swiss.
