This recipe was a disappointment for many different reasons. I recomend staying away from it. First, it didn't turn out at all like the picture shows.  They looked more like chocolate plops. They also tasted much worse than expected. Please don't try to bake these cookies.

These are awesome! The "cookie" part is very soft, chocolatey, cakey but not too sweet (I tried one before it was frosted and didn't really like it), but the little dab of chocolate frosting make these fabulous.  Next time I'll use smaller drops of dough for a slightly smaller cookie (I may have been a little too generous!  Some of mine baked up pretty large)  I used two squares of chocolate and about another 1/3 cup sugar for the frosting.  Great little chocolatey treat!

These came out great! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! More like little cakes - not crunchy like most cookies but we loved them!

These are really good - curiosity made me try them because they sounded so different. Like the other reviews said, they are cakey but still very good.  I followed the recipe very close, the only change was that I didn't top them with coconut but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. My son isn't a huge fan of coconut and if I topped them with coconut he wouldn't eat them -  a little coconut cooked in the cookie isn't too much for him.  I really like the slight taste of coffee in these too! I love the frosting! I'm glad I tried these.

This has been my brother's favorite cookie since he was a child.  Mom first baked them back in the mid-60's - they are still delicious.
