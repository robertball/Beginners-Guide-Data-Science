We enjoyed this recipe. Easy to make for a quick dinner and was very tasty. I accidentally added the whole amount of sauce to the meatballs so after fishing them out with a spoon to stuff the pita I used the cheesy sauce for dipping instead of plain sauce. It was a nice addition!

Had difficult task of obtaining pita bread so used a flat bread. Didn't make meat balls. just brown Turkey Italian sausage which turned out to be a bit bland so going with spicy version may be a improvement.

These were delightful. I used spicy italian turkey sausage and made it all in one pan. After frying the meatballs I removed to a plate deglazed the pan with 1/2 c of water and added cream cheese and sauce. Put the balls back in to simmer a bit. Spooned out into pita halves added mozzarella and baked. I'll make these again. Easy and really good.
