I made this for my hubby on his birthday and he loved it. The cake itself is awesome. It came out moist and tender. I took out 1 star for frosting because I didn't like its tangy taste. But this was the first time I had ever tasted cream cheese frosting.So it might just be me. So I added a little bit of melted chocolate and some more sugar to the frosting to make it more sweet. 

Also a TIP for adding bananas. Layer them just before you eat. Also don't leave the cake outside for long. Otherwise the bananas leave water and the layers will slide. Mine did the same thing. And I kind of didn't like the flavor of the softened bananas. Next time I think I ll add the banana cut up fresh while serving. 

But overall a very good tasting cake. Thanks Bakerbee and Aunt Lu :D

My review is for the cake only, which I made into cupcakes The cake is delicious, subtly chocolate,  more boldly banana flavored, but there's no mistaking either.  Moist, soft and fluffy, milk chocolate in color.   I had nothing against the frosting - it's just that I had a request from the recipients for something deeply chocolate, which I accommodated with the more robustly chocolate "Best Chocolate Frosting," also from this site.  It was the perfect choice for these cupcakes, a bold counterpoint for the milder cake.    One half recipe yielded one dozen cupcakes, which I baked 20-22 minutes.  Great recipe, but not as good with the  directions, so here goes:  sift the dry ingredients together and set aside.  Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then the vanilla.  Add the bananas. Add the flour mixture in three additions, alternately with the buttermilk , beginning and ending with the flour.  Done.

This is very good! Try it with fluffy peanut butter frosting instead of this frosting, if you like peanut butter. When I do this, I usually decorate it will Reese's pieces. Yum!

Mmm... this was sooo good! I have always loved bananas and chocolate together and it just tastes so perfect. My family literally licked the pan clean in about a week or two! Soo freakin' good! You just have to try this!!!

The texture was off on these, but it was my fault since I added Greek yogurt to the mix.  The mixture just was to thick for me so i added extra milk as well.  Good banana flavor with a hint of chocolate.  Made into cupcakes and frosted with regular cream cheese frosting.

This turned out awesome!! Will definitely make again! I will also use this frosting recipe for other cakes--it was a huge hit with my son and husband.  They wanted to eat the frosting by the spoonful!

Bakerbee here.   If you prefer a lighter layer cake, use cake flour.  (I prefer the heavier, old-fashioned version, but I have made it with cake flour for those too.  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe substituting the butter for pureed avocado. The cake came out very dense but moist and delicious. I tried the recipe again with some changes in hopes to make it fluffier. I sifted all the dry ingredients together. I separated the eggs, mixing in the yolks at the time when the recipe called for the eggs. I beat the whites into a nice fluff and folded them in at the end before pouring into the pans. I also used sugar in the raw and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup. The new cake was less dense but still not as fluffy as I would like. It was well received and I have no leftovers. I also added some pureed banana to the frosting recipe (keep in mind that adding the banana required I add more confectioners’ sugar).

Love, love, love!  There is nothing better than "from scratch".
I did hold off on the sugar from the batter and frosting (just a little), and you can't even tell, it's perfect, oh and I also only used one egg.

I liked this pretty well, i think i would like better, even without the Chocolate, and husband and 14 year old  said it would be better without Banana. So neat recipe, all in all.

This is the second time I’ve made this cake, and even more delicious than we remembered!  Some of my family  members  are dairy-free,  gluten-free and egg-free,  and this was an easy recipe to adapt using  gluten-free “one-to-one” flour, egg replacement, and coconut milk. I don’t know if it’s the flour or  cake pan sizes, but I found that two 8” pans worked better than the 9” pans.

Loved the idea. Don't know what I did wrong, but this was not only too strong of a banana flavor, but it was also way too heavy of a cake when I made it........  ???

Turned this recipe into cupcakes, and it turned out great! The frosting was a little sweet, but the cake was just fantastic!
