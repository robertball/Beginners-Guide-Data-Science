This was really good.  Eggs on sale for 39 cents a dozen so looking for great recipes to try.  I made it the dish and cooked it all in the same day.  I also added some turkey bacon and diced portobello mushrooms with red peppers for a bit more flavor and color.  It turns out just great - although I did have to cook it a bit longer. The pan didn't last long and it was gone.
