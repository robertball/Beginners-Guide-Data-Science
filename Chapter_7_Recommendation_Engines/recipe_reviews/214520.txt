This was EXCELLENT! I had never worked with rice paper before, but it's not difficult. You just have to work quickly before it becomes too soft (it's harder to peel it off your work surface when it's softer.) This is a really quick, easy recipe. The prep work of shredding carrots is the only part that took any real time. At first I was tempted to add something like lettuce, because the ingredient list is so simple, but I found it's just perfect with these three simple ingredients (beef, carrots, cilantro.) I would highly recommend this, it's delicious.

I went ahead and fried these because I wasn't sure how good they'd be uncooked. They turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I used ground beef and used Kraft Asian Toasted Sesame dressing in place of the stir-fry/marinade; I also eliminated the cilantro.  These were a huge hit with my boys who usually are not fans of spring rolls!
