I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut back a little on the olive oil.  I wanted a smooth dressing (no onion bits), so I put all ingredients except the oil into the blender, pulsed, and then streamed in the oil at the end with the blender running.  The end result was a dressing with perfect consistency.  You do need to let the flavors meld on this, so be sure to allow for some time in the fridge.  When I tasted this out of the blender, the olive oil was dominating, but after a couple hours in the fridge, it all came together.  This is a "tangy" french dressing with a lot of flavor and takes just minutes to make.  Thumbs up on this one.

Listen, and heeeeeeeaar me, people. This is good stuff. Use real sugar and get over it. I'll admit that I only made this recipe so I could later make "authentic" Big Mac sauce but I have been licking this off the spoon for the last 30 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly and let it sit in the fridge like a good girl. Do it! My regards, former ranch dressing girl.

TO MAKE IT HEALTHIER, I USED APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AND FRUCTOSE IN PLACE OF DISTILLED VINEGAR. ALSO USED CAYENNE PEPPER IN PLACE OF BLACK PEPPER.  OTHERWISE, IT WAS FABULOUS.  AUTUMN SINCLAIRE....(AUTHOR OF MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE COOKBOOK)

Very good French dressing!  Not too tart, not too sweet.  Still missing something though, can't quite put my finger on it.  Overall a very good recipe though!

This is some great dressing and is the basic recipe I'll use from now on to make French dressing. Being a big fan of vinegar (I like to sip different types of vinegars from a shot glass while working on line) I cut back a bit on the oil, I use canola because I don't like the taste of olive oil. I increased the vinegar to substitute the amount of oil I cut back on. Also I halved the recipe because I like to make all my dressings and like them to be as fresh as possible.

Delicious, right out of the blender.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, however I cut the amount listed in the recipe  in half.  The color is more pale than Ruby Red, as shown in the photo.  Used regular mustard and a dash of worchestershire sauce to give it some zing.  Better than any homemade French dressing recipe I've tried.  My local cafe makes their own, however, this is superior to theirs.  Love the consistency of the dressing,which adheres to the lettuce beautifully.

Easy to make and very yummy! I made 1/2 batch for my friend (I didn't want to waste a bottle of the store-bought stuff) but I also enjoyed it. Why buy bottled when you can make your own and do it better1 Thanks for the recipe!

I make a batch of this every couple of weeks.  My family loves it.  We eat walking taco salad every other Wednesday and use this dressing.  I dump all the ingredients into the Vitamix and mix on high for about 20 or 30 seconds.  I use raw apple cider vinegar, dehydrated onion, and real mustard only because I didn't have the other ingredients called for at the time.  Oh and I didn't add the paprika or lemon juice simply because I've been out of it these.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Excellent! Changes: Apple cider vinegar and onion powder as I was too lazy to finely dice the onion.

Great taste and perfect consistency. Far superior to any store branded dressing   I used cider vinegar in place of white vinegar; otherwise, I was true to the ingredients and amounts.

Yes it is similar to a Catalina dressing. I love it because I can control ingredients in it and use organic. My tweaks are a little onion powder, garlic powder and fresh garlic plus as others mention, I use a blender to smooth it out. I mainly use it as a roast beef marinade and cooking sauce in a cast iron Dutch oven with potatoes, carrots , celery and more garlic.

Very Good. Easy, Be aware, the recipe does basically a quart.  Blended with a stick blender, it doesn't separate.  Very flavorful, but definitely not a commercial chemical dressing.

Made a double batch for a "salad bar" party at work. I made it exactly as the recipe said. It was delicious and a big hit at work. Many people were surprised that you can make your own salad dressing.
  It was one of the easiest things I've ever made. 
  I will make this many more times and I will make it as it is written. No need for improvement.

I make this all the time and always get compliments. I use smoked Spanish paprika, dehydrated onion flakes and sometimes stevia for a low sugar version.

I followed the recipe and my color came out on the brown side compared to the picture. I ended up blending the dressing because of the onion bits. A little tangy which I assumed was the vinegar coming through. I have to agree with a few reviews that it taste more like a Catalina than a French dressing.

Bright, tangy flavor, easy to adjust to taste or to accommodate ingredients on hand..  My grandmother always added some Worcestershire sauce to hers and I did the same, but it would be just as good without.

Totally loved this!  My husband is a French dressing fanatic but I've had a hard time finding one that was natural and pure. I made this and it was a hit!  So easy to make. I added all the ingredients to a mason jar and just shook it up!

Quite tasty! I blended the recipe in the blender and ate a salad -- but realized it wasn't very tangy. After checking the recipe again, I realized I'd missed the vinegar! So, I ate a second salad, with the vinegar added, and it was quite good but almost too tart. I will definitely be eating this and perhaps using a touch less vinegar next time. Yummy!

I cut the ketchup in half and blended it all for a smooth texture. Got a few compliments from the fire hall on this dressing.

This is a pretty good salad dressing, but it tastes more like a Catalina-type french.....which I'm not a big fan of. But, with that being said, this is still pretty good and it won't go to waste.

This dressing is absolutely scrumptious! Don't be put off by the amount of sugar in it. It's worth it! I must admit to using onion powder (one tsp) instead of fresh onion thinking that it might keep longer but I have also made it with the fresh onion and don't think the recipe suffered for the sustitution. This is such a simple recipe that I don't know why anyone would buy French dressing. I just use a big shaker (for protein drinks) or large water bottle and shake it up until it's mixed. A funnel helps and if you start with the sugar, other dry ingredients, then oil and other wet things you only need one funnel and Voila! all in the bottle mess free! Shake, shake, shake and done!

In my opinion, and likely for anybody else whose experience with salad dressings derives primarily from Kraft dressings, this is more of a Catalina than a French. It's not a bad dressing at all.

I was expecting a Catalina type dressing and I thought this was nasty.

Excellent french dressing!    Definitely the best french dressing recipe I've tried.   Great taste and beautiful color.  The only addition I made was a clove of pressed garlic.    Might try adding some tomato paste for a little more richness next time.

My mom used to make a recipe like this. I'm glad to have it. I used 1 1/2 tsp of grated onion instead.
