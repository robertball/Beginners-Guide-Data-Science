I have been using this recipe for years, and they're the best!  I recently looked for it on this site so that I could scale it down enough to fit in a quart jar for gifts.  This is now my base chocolate cookie.  I just add different baking chips and nuts for variation.

The cookies were a hit with my friends.  They turned out a little flat, but delicious.

These were yummy.  Funny, my husband & daughter asked if they were the "cat poop cookies" that I pranked on Halloween (which were horrible, but funny).  I had to assure them that these were the real deal & very tasty.  Thanks!!

These are great!  My mom made these all the time while I was growing up.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour, and they were sooooo good!  I also was 2 tablespoons short on butter but they still turned out.  Used peanut butter chips from the natural foods section of Fred Meyer to avoid yucky trans fats.  These are great and I'm glad I have finally made them myself!

These are incredible. My co-workers couldn't keep their hands off of them... gone within a day, and normally 2 batches of cookies last at least a week.  Quick and simple to whip together and the batter itself is delicious.  ;)

These were absolutely wonderful! They were so soft, they were falling apart. I took them to work and they didn't last long. Delicious!

These just came out of the oven (at 10 am) and we are eating them for breakfast!!! They are soft, yet not falling apart, and SO TASTY!! I buy the Betty Crocker chocolate cookie w/PB chips pouch mix and have been trying to find a "scratch" recipe that is as good.  I made 2 TBS. sized cookies and baked for 12 minutes and it still make 4-1/2 dozen cookies.

These are some yummy cookies!  I have made them many times, and they are always good.  I use reduced calorie margarine and egg substitute, but the cookies are still delicious!  My sister is a Reese's fanatic, so of course, they go by quickly :)

This cookie has been a Christmas staple at our house for years. I've never had a problem actually making the cookies but I do run into a problem finding the peanut butter chips at certain times of the year. Try these cookies today. You won't be disappointed!

Not bad. Just be sure to pay attention to the "drop by rounded TEASPOONS" part.  Made mine alittle too big and they didn't cook all the way through or flatten out.  I'm guessing that's why others had similar issues as well.  I'll give it another shot sometime.

Wow these cookies are awesome.  The batter was slightly thin though, with all that butter and not enough flour, so I got many many thin cookies that break when picked up.  Next time I will add more flour.  I had to cook each batch 13 minutes.  Oh and it does NOT make 41 dozen like the recipe says.  I got about 4 1/2 dozen, like it says in the middle of the recipe, not the top.  Man, everyone LOVED these at work, thanks.  Can't wait to assemble the ice cream sandwiches for my boyfriend!

Theese cookies where great! I made them for an office birthday party and the went nuts over them.... but instead of putting Reeses chips in it, I put the same amount of Reeses Pieces into the batter. It added alot of color and everyone just had to have to recipe.

Good as ice cream sandwiches, otherwise too rich.  I also had to bake mine for an extra two minutes or we ended up with batter on our teeth, even after cooling.  Probably won't make again.  Too bad, had high hopes after reading the great reviews.

Great Cookies! Only problem I had was keeping my husband's hands off of them long enough for them to cool.  They went fast at my house!

These were wonderful when they came out of the oven, but became a bit hard after they cooled completely.  But they were still tasty!  I added more peanut butter chips than called for.  They were very easy to make, and if I make them again I'm going to try the ice cream sandwiches.

We love this recipe! I changed it to use 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup shortening (usually I'd use all butter but I only had 1/2 cup left in the house) and it worked just fine. I also used 1 cup of peanut butter chips and one cup of white chocolate chips, and I got a lot of rave reviews from my classmates about the "two chip-py goodness".

Very soft and chewy.   Kind of a lot of work for a "basic cookie".  But I got good reviews.  :-)

These cookies were soft, chewy and very good!  Quick & easy to make (baking at 8 minutes was perfect for me), will definitely be making again.  Still soft and chewy the following day but almost all gone.  Very good cookies!

Yummy recipe!  Some of my cookies came fell flat, but that was easily remedied when I began baking the cookies at the TOP of the oven instead of the bottom rack.  Very chewy cookies with an excellent flavor!

These have a wonderful taste, but each time I make them they turn out flat (and I typically don't have a flat-cookie problem).  My problem might be that I use my 1.5T scoop, which makes a bigger cookie than the recipe calls for.  If you desire a thicker, chewier cookie, try the Peanut Butter Chip Chocolate Cookie recipe on this site.
