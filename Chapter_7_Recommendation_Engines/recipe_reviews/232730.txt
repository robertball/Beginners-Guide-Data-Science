I've been trying to replicate a delicious light pink sauce primavera with roasted vegetables I'd had in NYC. I would always order it and it was divine. This comes close. I julienned the veggies - how the restaurant served it - and used only carrots, a yellow squash, two green zucchini, a sweet onion and sliced up some baby bella shrooms. Plopped them on a baking sheet, added maybe two tbls of olive oil, a decent sprinkling of the herbs, salt and fresh ground pepper. Roasted at 400 for 25 mins, stirring twice. My mistake - using a cheap, store-brand parmesan that I'd freshly grated for the sauce. Big mistake as the sharp, cheap flavor was just awful and  pretty much ruined what could've been a deliciously delicate, yet complex finished dish. Next time, I'll use better parmesan and actually leave it out of the sauce altogether, putting it on to taste when serving. I'll also probably double the sauce, as the veggies soaked up a lot of it. Oh, and I may also use less butter and light cream next time. Liked this recipe a lot, sorry for the changes. It's a great start for the recipe I'm looking to replicate.

I love roasted vegetables, so I really enjoyed this dish. I doubled the tomato sauce, chicken stock, and light cream in the recipe so that I could have a saucier pasta. I did not double the butter or cheese, though, just because I felt like 6 tablespoons of butter would have been a bit much. It came out very tasty even with the slight tweaks.
This is a good one for kiddos because the sauce is very mild. Next time I'll probably add some crushed red pepper just to give it a little bit of a kick.

This was delicious and easy to make. I used soy milk instead of light cream and served it on spaghetti instead of farfelle.  Next time I'd make a lot more of the sauce, maybe twice as much.

Delicious,  very easy . Did not have light cream so I used half and half.  It tasted just as good.

I made a full pound of pasta and extra sauce, as my family can't get enough!  I use whatever vegetables are on hand, including broccoli and carrots.  I also roast the tomatoes.  Excellent!

this is an excellent, flavourful recipe! easy to make, lots of room for variations of your own with vegetable choice, cheese choice and noodle choice. don't forget to allow time for the cream to thicken!

Quick and simple. I left out the broccoli because the one I had looked questionable.

This was just a Super Yummy/ Quick dinner tonight! I had leftover Tri Tip roast from last night and some nacho cheese I found in the fridge. My pasta was already cooked in chicken broth and I just emptied the crisper for the veggies. My son had 2 serving and he is NOT a big veggie eater either! Thank You  Jcd317 Ya got a Winner here!
