Honestly, I was suspect that a honey mustard salad dressing with so few calories and fat would taste good, but I had to give it a try.  I had only blueberry Greek yogurt in the fridge, so I used Dannon plain nonfat yogurt and let it drain for a couple hours in a paper-towel lined colander.  Wouldn't say this is my favorite honey mustard dressing, but to my surprise, this is pretty tasty and a lot healthier for you than the one that I've been making.  I will be making this again.  *****UPDATE 2.18.17*****  Today, I cut the recipe in half, made this with 1 Tbsp each spicy brown mustard and honey mustard, reduced the honey to 1 Tbsp, and it was delicious.

Wow! Fat free never tasted so good! In fact I tested it on my husband who vows to never eat anything fat free (lucky him) and he didn't notice the difference - definite winner! This is one creamy dressing that you don't have to feel guilty about. Plus it takes so few ingredients that come together for something so tasty. This was a great little recipe to experiment with - changing up the type of mustard and subbing a little white wine vinegar for the lemon juice.  I liked it so much I tried dijon and yellow mustard both with as much success as the spicy brown.  All I added was a pinch of salt to taste. It was perfect over mixed greens, cucumber, thin sliced red onion and cherry tomatoes.  This was so easy to make that I'll definitely be using it often! Thanks for a great recipe!

Exellent recipe!!!
I used Oiko's plain Greek yogurt. I didn't have spicy brown mustard or honey on hand, so instead I replaced them with maple syrup ( Which is 40 calories fewer than honey when measuring 1/4 cup ), and I used yellow mustard which has 0 calories. Now, for each serving about 1/6 cup comes out to 27 calories per serving!!! Wuah~~~~ Not to mention, super delicious!!! 
Thank you for sharing your recipe!! Will use this again and again!!!

I really didn't expect much from this and was pleasantly surprised. I only had Balkan yogurt, but it's thick like Greek yogurt and worked well. I also used half Dijon and half yellow mustard in place of the brown mustard. I couldn't help myself and I added a touch of granulated garlic. I forgot to add the lemon juice at first and I think I prefer it without. The yogurt has lots of tang already and I'll leave it out next time. A great recipe that I will use again soon!

I'm so Happy that I will never have to Search for a Honey Mustard Dressing again!!!! NO Changes made! :)
I have found that if I mix some of the Honey Mustard with the "Lemon Poppyseed Dressing" on this site...It's Out of This World GOOD!!! I don't mix them together - I just use half of each. I am going to try to mix small amounts of each together and see what happens - should be OK.

It was quite nice. I think it was a bit too sweet for my tasting (I do have a sweet-tooth though) so next time I will use half the amount of honey. I only had regular prepared yellow mustard as well.  I also added a bit of dill. I think this will become one of my "go-to" dressings and dip.

I have to admit, when I was mixing this together, I was thinking "No Way!"  It looked pretty unappetizing.  But I was surprised.  I love honey-mustard and have tried most of the low fat and fat free varieties at the grocery store.  This was superior to any of those.  I used mostly yellow mustard, with maybe a tablespoon of spicy mustard--my personal preference.  Next time I'll up the proportion  brown mustard a little bit.   Don't get your expectations up that this is as good as full fat, but it's a darn good substitute.

Really liked this dressing, although I had to substitute maple syrup for the honey (and only used 2 tbsp--more than that would have been overkill) and a wedge of lime instead of lemon.  I liked it a lot but I think a tsp of whatever citrus you use would be plenty.  1 wedge of lime was almost too much so I can't imagine it with 2tbsp.  Giving 5 stars since I had to substitute fully 1/2 of the ingredients and I think it would be unfair to take a star away because of it, but if I make this again as written I will definitely not use the full amount of either honey or lemon.

I made this as an alternative to bottled dressings. It has a distinct taste. My husband liked it and he usually only wants French and Thousand island. A healthier alternative.

I made the mistake of substituting nonfat plain yogurt for the Greek yogurt (I don't like Greek yogurt on its own), and the plain yogurt lacked the body to take the edge off of the mustard, leaving it overpowering. I am going to try it again, this time adhering to the recipe.

Good dressing, but a little too sweet for me. Next time I'll cut down on the honey. Made with my homemade plain yogurt.

This is so yummy! I have made this recipe just as is and it's wonderful! This time I took some info in the reviews to change it up a bit, I doubled the recipe. I used 1/2 Dijon mustard and 1/2 regular mustard, 1/2 honey, 1/2 maple syrup, 1/2 white wine vinegar and 1/2 lemon juice. Fantastic! It's so awesome to have my favorite honey mustard dressing with less calories and tasting so good!
