The salsa is TOO SALTY!!!! It totally killed it. Anyone who knows their way around a kitchen, knows that once you add salt, it's a bit difficult to fix if it's too salty. Follow my advice - add half the salt, stir and taste and do it at the end of making the salsa. I added fresh mint to the salsa and the sweetness of this did help the taste.(But not enough, sorry. My kids who love mango rated this 2 1/2 *. I had two mangoes, lots of fish and doubled the recipe. I also dipped the fish in flour after rubbing with curry rub and this made a nice, curry, crunchy coating on the outside and the rub was worth 3 1/2*. Overall, I'd try the rub again, but the salsa was salt overkill.

Have used this recipe a few times and my husband loves the results.

I have substituted the fresh mangoes for frozen ones which I thawed and have been using them since.  I find the frozen ones sweeter than the fresh ones.  Not the right season for the fresh mangoes here.

We will definitely make this dish again.

We did not make modifications to the receipe.

OMG this recipe was awesome.   My first time for making Tilapia - although I order it out quite a bit!  So easy..and the flavors were great.   I added some cucumber to the mango salsa....This will become one of my favorites!!

I had never made or eaten tilapia before using this recipe, and I must say this is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  I didn't use the whole chile just because it was very very spicy, but otherwise everything else was absolutely delicious.  The mango definetly compliments the fish. Very easy and simple recipe to use.

I actually omitted the salt because I forgot it--good thing too, the salsa doesn't need it at all.

Delicious!  We only made the curried tilapia (I didn't have a mango on hand but was looking for a new way of cooking tilapia).  It was great - nice and spicy.  I had no idea what garlic pepper was so looked up a recipe for it and made it myself.  (Combine 1 TBS garlic powder, 1/2 TBS of pepper and 1 TBS of parsley)  I loved how quick and easy the recipe was.  We will definitely make again.

This is a very tasty "healthy" choice for anyone trying to eat better foods.  My entire family enjoyed the flavors including my 10 and 2 year old daughters.  Just a note:  if you are a food processer user, don't.  The salsa is much prettier if it is hand chopped.  Then, you can clearly see all the colors!

This was wonderful! Just the rub alone was great. My mango wasnt as soft as Id like it to be so just make sure your mango is ripe enough. I was also worried about the serrano chile bec Ive never had one b4 and it wasnt that hot. I also didnt add the onion bec I dont like raw onions but this was soo good.

I gave it a four but I'm thinking it has something to do with the situation I was in and not the recipe. So, I made this wonderfully beautiful presentation of a dinner with all of the promise that the ingredients list gives you and then we had to wait almost 30 minutes to eat because the cable guy was here.  By the time we ate it, the fish was lukewarm.  I can't wait to make it again (sans the cable guy) and eat it at the peak of flavor.

The tilapia did have much flavor. Next Time I make this, I will rub the curry powder and salt on the tilapia at least 4 hrs before I make the dish. Hopefully this will make the tilapia have more flavor

Wow! Fantastic Tilapia. I didn't make the mango salsa, but the fish was awesome. I did add some seasoning salt (personal preference and fed it to 80+ people. Loads of compliments and 0 complaints. Great recipe!

I couldn't stop patting myself on the back for this one!  It was so delicious and healthy.  I followed the tilapia directions exactly (exept using thawed frozen filets and making a little extra rub), but I added cucumber to the salsa (because I had it and someone else mentioned it in a review), used thawed, frozen mango and only used a pinch of salt and used jalepeno instead of serrano.  I served the filets over beds of cilantro lime rice, topped with the salsa.  Beautiful presentation and so easy!

Loved it just as is! However, for my husband (who doesn't handle spicy very well...) I used less Serrano, and have often substituted jalapeno

Unless I did something wrong, I found this quite uninteresting. There didn't seem to be enough of the rub for the amount of fish on the recipe(each tilapia fillet weighs about 8 oz.). I added a little more oil to make it more spreadable, but I still thought it over- powered the sweetness of the fish. What did help, however, was adding a squeeze of lime at the end to balance it all out.

This is so incredibly healthy, and so delicious!  The mango salsa tastes so fresh and is wonderful alongside the curried tilapia.  I make this about once every two weeks and love it.

Really good curry taste for the mild fish. The fresh cilantro was a bit too strong in the mango salsa. I would put less, or maybe dried next time

Healthful, flavorful dinner in 10 min. Can't beat it. The rub is perfect for Tilapia. Brushed rub lightly on both sides of the fish and blackened it 3 min. each side on the highest heat setting. 30 seconds before it was done I brushed the top of the fish with bottled mango chutney from the store. Same effect as the mango salsa with no work! Served with a side dish of mixed wild rice, basimati rice and peas. Sprayed the same pan I cooked the Tilapia in with cooking oil - left on highest heat setting - spooned the mix onto the pan and let it cook 3 min. * Leave it alone*; don't stir. This makes lots of little super crunchy rice nuggets. So good I had to go back and cook a second round for everybody but no problem as it only takes 10 min. start to finish.

This recipe is wonderful! My family eats tilapia often, and we are always looking for new ways to prepare it.  All of us really enjoyed this!  I had to substitute green onion for the red, since that was all I had on hand, and instead of the serrano chile (also not on hand) I used a little Caribbean Jerk seasoning.  It came out great, so I will probably do the same thing next time.

I am not a real big fish eater but I tried this and I have to say HUMMY !!! It was a little hot so I made it a second time and only put half of the chopped pepper in the salsa and I loved it even more. The rub was fantastic. I would even eat the fish without the salsa. Thanks foe a fantastic recipie.

This is my go-to recipie for tilapia.  I've tried it with several variations.  The salsa is the most labor intensive part so at times I've made a double batch and then freeze 1/2 of it.  If you have the time char the serrano chile and red onion a bit, I also throw the salsa in a blender.  I generally also add some unseasoned breadcrumbs to the fish to give it some more crunch and will often bake it, flipping once about halfway thru.  I enjoy serving it with couscous, excellent salsa and good tilapia recipe.

My 12 year old could not get enough.  She is a fish- and a fruit-aholic - I'm now teaching her how to prepare it.

This is a very good recipe for tilapia when you're looking for something different. I agree that there was too much salt in the salsa. I used thawed frozen mangos to save time (they were already chopped) and left out the hot pepper (kids would not like). I also only put the curry mixture on one side of the fish before cooking, and that was plenty. I would definitely make this recipe again, it was very tasty and relatively easy to put together. I served it with saffron rice from this site; the rice was very good also and paired well with the fish. Substituting mint for the cilantro or in addition to sounds interesting...may try that next time! Thanks for the great recipe - taste buds super happy!

I have to be completely honest....I am really only rating the salsa, because I just used a citrus basil seasoning on the tilapia. We loved the mango salsa and I will definitely be making it again! So easy, fresh and delish!! The only change I made was using a jalapeno pepper instead of the serrano chili and it was great. I also used very little salt. I could see using this with chicken or pork as well. Thanks for sharing!

Good mix of flavors.  Didn't have fresh chili on hand, so I used some red chili flakes.  Also added avocado to the salsa mix.  Omitted cilantro because we don't like it.  Also used a little bit of garlic salt and ground black pepper instead of garlic pepper and used no salt.  Really enjoyed the curry and salsa flavor together.  Thanks for a quick and tasty recipe!

This was delish! but I totally agree with adding NO salt to the mango salsa. I added just a touch and it was totally unnecessary. 
I made the salsa in the morning and seasoned the fish about 4 hours before I was going to start cooking and I think these 2 steps really enhanced the flavour. 
We BBQd the fish instead of frying and it came out perfect. 
Also, if you're gonna make this be sure to buy really good curry like Lalah's from your local West/East Indian store. The supermarket stuff in the little packets just won't cut it.

The fish was good - we used extra spices to create a nice crust.  The mango salsa was AMAZING!  I substituted a long hot green pepper for the serrano pepper because we didn't want too much heat, and the flavors were perfect!  The salsa went wonderfully with the fish.

This was really good, although spicier than I was expecting. I did like the curry rub on the tilapia and the salsa was a great addition to the fish.

O.K.  I didn't expect to like this recipe as much as I did. I loved the flavors. I agree that the salsa dosen't need any salt! I seasoned and breaded my Tilapia. Awesome contrast with texture & flavor. Also I didn't have any serrano chile's so I left it out and it was still delicious. I served it with a brown rice & orzo mix.

The rub for the fish is excellent.  I used the salsa from "Grilled Tilapia with Mango Salsa" from this site instead.

I didn´t put any salt.
I am in Brazil, so I don´t have serrano chili,  I had used "dedo de moça" chili.
It is an excellent dish.

This is probably one of the best talapia recipes out there. The seasonings were really good and I can't say enough good things about the mango salsa. It was very light and not oily. This will make a good summer meal.

I substituted the tilapia for chicken, and it came out great! I also took it a step further and turned this recipe into tacos. But what I came here to say is that this is a great recipe for mango pico de gallo! The proportions are great, and the lime juice is crucial.

Tasty and light, like many other reviewers said- this was also my first time preparing a tilapia dish. It was very easy to make- always a plus. I'm not really a fish lover, but my boyfriend is and he loved it.

The mango and fish combination is great.  One variation is to fry the fish and then cook the fish and mango together with gravy.

My husband and I give this recipe a 5-star rating. We have served it to our friends.  The mango salsa is an outstanding compliment to the fish.  I was a little hesitant -- fish and fruit, fruit and onions -- but it was good.  I doubled the rub for the fish because we like curry and I wanted the fish to be thoroughly coated.  I reduced the black pepper a little because we wanted the full curry flavor.  Try it, even if you are not a fish fan.
