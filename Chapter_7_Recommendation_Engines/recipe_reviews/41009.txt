This is now a family favorite. It has all the components for a balanced meal by itself. I make it for dinner instead of a holiday appitizer, and there are never any leftovers, even from my kids!

It's good for brunch or light dinner.  You don't have to use a bread machine...just add 1 cup flour to yeast & water and then beat on low 30 seconds, then high 3 minutes, then add remaining flour. You'll then knead for 3-5 minutes.  Bake at 375 for 40 minutes.  My whole family loves this bread.
