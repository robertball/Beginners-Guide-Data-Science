This is a wonderful recipe - it is now my favorite sugar cookie recipe.  Make sure you do not use electric beaters to mix in vanilla, egg and cream - do it by hand.  I ruined my first batch with the electric beaters - the dough was too sticky and soft, even after chilling for hours.

THE BEST EVER! More like 8 stars! Will never bake any other sugar cookie but THESE and I know my sugar cookies! Ok... because I AM the Queen of taking short cuts (and always in a hurry) here's my take on these! I mixed the dry ingredients in my Kitchen Aide. Blended the softened butter in with the mixer too. Added all other ingreds the way suggested... except... I hand rolled balls of the dough up and put them on a four dusted surface. I rolled them over just to get a dust of flour on them. I took a glass (bottom LIGHTLY dusted in flour) and just squished them flat! I picked them up with a spatula, brushed off any excess flour, put them onto the baking sheet.  I baked them for about 10 min, but I watched them close after 8 min. While they were still warm I glazed them with the glaze from "Glazed Apple Cream Pie" (allrecipes.com), and put the traditional holiday sprinkles on them! FAST.... EASY..... AND OHHHHH SO GOOD! :)

This recipe is the real deal! I just finished making them with my 21 month old son and we've almost "tested" about 1/4 of the batch! We didn't have cream so I just used whole milk in it's place and it worked just fine and I also increased the vanilla to 2 tsp, but that's a personal preference. Next time I will use cream and I'm sure it will be even better. My son loves to roll dough and cut shapes and this dough was very easy for him to work with. I did chill the dough but I felt it was slightly easier to work with once it was room temperature again. I didn't find this dough to be too dry at all as some reviewers mentioned. I do lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup rather than dip the measuring cup into the flour which may make a difference in how much flour is used. I also creamed the butter and sugar together as recommended by another reviewer. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

A lot of the reviews state that the dough is too dry. It's perfect without adding any additional liquid. You have to give the butter a chance to "melt" after you cut it in. At first I thought it was too dry, so I got my clean hands in there and kind of kneaded the dough. The heat from my hands melted the butter and in a few minutes, it was the perfect consistency. Perfect. Do not add additional cream or anything. Trust me!

These cookies are like my Great grandmother's recipe.  Because they are like pie, they roll out easily.  I had no problem with sticky dough at all.  They cook quick, so watch out you don't burn them.

Like so many in the previous ratings, I had also searched and searched for a good sugar cookie recipe that I could use for cut-outs, only to be disappointed time and again.  My search is over!  My son & I just made these, but we didn't make cut-outs.  We rolled them into balls then pressed them with a slotted spatula.  (The cookies have raised bars going across them.  Cute!)  They don't spread at all when baking which tells me they'll be superb for cut-outs.  (I can't wait 'til Christmas!!)  Super easy to make and work with.  Light, slightly crisp, melt-in-your-mouth, delicious.  Like others, I thought the dough was a bit dry but I didn't add more liquid.  As we worked with it, it came together beautifully.  Thanks, Jessica, for sharing this!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever made.  These cookies were everything a sugar cookie should be- perfectly delectible.  I made these right in the KitchenAid, not with the pastry blender- and they were perfect.  They didn't stick at all; the dough was such a pleasure to work with.  My 2-year-old was able to cut them out with me.  Thank you!

This is a good recipe for classic sugar cookies. But keep an eye on the oven, because they burn easily.

very good cookie. These cookies were moist and not hard to roll out. Not sticky like other sugar cookies I have tried. I also tried a different variation by useing 1/2 a cup of coca and a 1/2 less flour and made a chocolate sugar cookie and it worked great.

This was a very easy and yummy recipe.  I liked the fact that it was not necessary to chill the cookie dough, as I had only limited time to make cookies.  I made star shapes and iced them with brightly coloured icing (red, green, blue and yellow) and put edible silver balls on the tip of each star point.  They looked very festive for Christmas and went in a flash at the morning tea I took them to (lots of kids there!).

My mom died recently and her mother died when she was a young girl.  She remembered making sugar cookies with her mom as a favorite memory, so we spent much of my girlhood trying to find exactly that same recipe that her mom used by trying dozens of variations.  When I made these with my five-year-old son today, I had the sense that I had found finally that perfect cookie recipe that my mom made with her mom. This was quite a wonderful moment, the circle of life, all brought on by these exquisite cookies.  Added a splash more cream and a dab (probably 2 T) more butter.  Perfect, simply perfect. Thanks so much.

Love them!  Make them exactly as directed only a little bigger and I use icing and sprinkles.  The key is to make sure the butter is very, very soft and use your hands to mix it in if need be.  Also make sure you use a spoon after mixing in the butter do not use an electric mixer

Great cookies, easy to make. I added zest from a orange to give it the real old fashioned cookie I remember as a kid. I use powdered sugar to roll out the cookies instead of flour. This is a bakers secret I learned when working as a baker in college years ago..

i cannot tell you how skeptical i was about this recipe. i've never been pleased with the consistency or taste of sugar cookies i and others have made in the past with passed down recipes. i like my cookies soft, slightly buttery and full of taste- not like cardboard!

this recipe is incredible. it's definitely the best, and will be replacing my recipe permanently. this was so easy to put together; it didn't take cream of tartar (which i never have!) and when i finished combining everything, i rolled out a bit without chilling it and it was the perfect consistency with no sticking to my well-floured counter. i put the remaining dough in the fridge while the cookies baked, but i found no difference- it rolled out perfectly either way. these cookies don't rise or spread very much, so you can be confident that whatever shape you cut will stay. i rolled mine a little thicker than recommended and i had wonderful, soft, tasty cookies that melted in my mouth when warm and stayed soft even the morning after sitting on an open plate on the counter! i just can't say enough about this recipe. there's nothing bad about it!

you may be skeptical, but just try it and you'll see!

I've been using Grandma Minnie's recipe for a long time now...it's my go-to sugar cookie recipe and everyone just loves it. It's not too sweet, so you can use a sweeter icing or frosting. It holds up extremely well, it doesn't spread in the oven (PERFECT for cut-outs!). The baked cookies freeze extremely well, which is so great for those of us who need to bake really far ahead. Just thaw and frost. They stay tender for a long time on the counter in an air-tight container. I absolutely love this recipe and refuse to use anything else!

This was my first attempt at sugar cookies and OH MY GOODNESS, were they good!! They deserve more than five stars, really. I was short on time so I rolled the dough into balls and smooshed them with a lightly floured glass, as suggested by another reviewer.  I topped 1/2 of them with green sugar and the other 1/2 with red sugar and served them at Christmastime. Absolutely gorgeous and delicious--will make again and again!

This is the perfect sugar cookie and should be followed to the letter - including mixing instructions. I loved that it didn't crack or swell up so much that the cookie lost it's original shape. The flavor was excellent. As a decorator, what I loved most about this cookie is that it could stand up to the humidity and extra moisture from a color flow icing. This is my go to recipe from now on.

OK, these may be THE perfect sugar cookie, especially for cut-outs. They are tasty, and hold up well to layers of glazes, frostings and sprinkles! I made exactly as directed with the addition of a generous teaspoon of finely grated lemon peel. The best thing is that they don't really spread so if your cookie cutters have intricate shaping the cookies come out looking just like that!
Resist the temptation to add extra butter or cream, (this will make them spread more) the dough seems a tad dry but becomes supple and pliable as you roll it out. Anytime I plan on doing decorated cut-outs, this will be the recipe I use!

This is a wonderful cookie and stays soft and fresh for days later.  I have also freezed them and used them later for that rainy day or surprise school bake sale. They taste like you just baked them!  Thank you for this awesome recipe that works and taste great...I also used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe submitted by Janice Brubaker and with these both together makes a great team if you want to ice your cookies instead of putting the sugar on them before you bake the cookies. Yummy!

A wonderful cookie!  I found that these were much better, and easier to handle when they were *not* chilled.  I made two batches, and only chilled one, and the unchilled batch rolled out smoothly and easily compared to the chilled batch.

This is a wonderful sugar cookie--crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. This cookie holds it's shape very well as it bakes, so it's ideal for cut-outs. I used the Butter Icing for Cookies submitted by Barbara on this site, and the result was delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I love these cookies! I found this several years ago while searching for a recipe where the dough didn't need to be refrigerated so I could use it in a baking program at the nursing home where I worked. It has been made many times since then, both there and at my own home. Thanks so much!

I am new to baking so I still have a lot to learn.  The width of my roll out dough...how do you make it uniform?  As it is some cookies are thin and crispy and some are thick and soft...lol      This is the easiest sugar cookie dough to make and to use.  I don't even sift the ingredients and it still comes out.  I have to triple the recipe each time because we eat the cookies about as fast as they bake.      Thank you for sharing this recipe that is great for all level of bakers.

After scouring through all the sugar cookie receipes last year, having never made them before, I decided to make a batch of this recipe for all the family last christmas....it was fantastic.  So easy to make, the shapes held well, and my 4 year old son adored getting involved in the decorating too.  I got rave reviews from everyone, so I wont even bother trying any others since these turned out so perfect. This is definitely going to be my traditional sugar cookie recipe from now on.

almost exactly the same as my mom's, so naturally it gets 5 stars! Ran out of white flour so I used half a cup of whole wheat and they were still delicious. Melted butter/confectioner's sugar/vanilla/spash of milk makes a fantastic frosting for them!

These cookies are awesome. I was looking for a nice cookie cutter sugar cookie recipe and this one is a keeper! I used skim milk instead of cream (I didn't have any) and was worried about the fat/creaminess so I just added a sliver of extra butter.  Five minutes at 375F was just perfect for these.
I will make them again!

Good Recipe.  Reason I only gave it 4 stars:  I found another recipe that was really similar and tasted just as good and everything was done right in the mixer.  No sifting or cutting in.  I have two small children so I look for good but easy recipes, not so time consuming.  But over all tasted very good!

This is a classic Old-World cookie dough recipe!  This is just like the cookie dough my great aunt used in her German Bakery in Chicago.  The dough is not supposed to be very "sweet"...sweetness should come from icing, frosting make of powdered sugar and butter.  This is how cookies are supposed to taste, before modern over-processing and over-sweetening.  This is a cookie you will savor.  It's a must to use cream or half-and-half, not milk.  AAAAA+++++++

Great cookies! I used milk instead of cream and cooked them for 6 minutes. They stayed soft, not crispy, and were soooo good. They taste even better with frosting on them, but then again, I have a major sweet tooth!

THE BEST sugar cookie recipe ever!!!  This is made up very similar to pie crust.  I too, did everything in my Kitchenaid in about 10 min from start to fridge.  If you roll the dough into a log, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until stiff, then you can do them as slice and bake cookies-just add some sprinkles or sugar or whatever you like.  Or do them as cut outs and decorate with royal icing.  I always Hated doing sugar cookies before-but no more--These are GREAT!

This recipe allowed my 3 year old and 7 year old the freedom to roll out, roll out, and roll out again and the cookies were still delicious. And...my house smells wonderful. Great recipe.

This came out great.  It does feel like it will be too crummy when you begin to roll it out, but the added flour and extra rolling make it just fine.

Just baked a batch of these, and they turned out perfectly!  The only change I made was adding an extra half-table spoon of vanilla because I prefer very sweet sugar cookies.  The dough was easy to handle, and they baked up wonderfully.  Now I just have to keep my boyfriend from eating them all before I decorate them!

Several years ago I threw out all my recipes that needed to be rolled out. I never had any luck with them. Today I watched my 3 yr old grandson roll this recipe out and now know there is hope for me. This cookie recipe is so easy and you end up with great sugar cookies.

I made the cookies this moring with my 2,5 year old son. At first it was very sticky (followed the recipe step by step)
The cookies are not so sweet and therby wonderful to put icing on them (the icing of Janice Brubaker on this site)

I had to use a very amount of flour to keep the dough sticking on the table. Cutting the cookies was great and fun.

I loved these!  I made half of them with sugar crystals and iced the other half with "Sugar cookie icing."  If I had it to over again, I would ice them all.  I added 1 t. each of almond and butter extracts, which I thought was super.

The Best Sugar Cookies I Have Ever Made! No refrigeration needed. Dough is very easy to make and work with. Minimal mess cookie! I am a mom who bakes Christmas cookies from scratch, but uses store bought dough the rest of the year. In other words, I'm an amateur at best. I have always especially dreaded making sugar cookie cut-outs because...well...I usually make a huge mess of it. So, I followed this recipe to the letter with two exceptions. I used 4 tbsp 1% milk in place of the cream because I didn't have any. And I baked the cookies at 375 because my oven runs hot. When I was done mixing the dough, I was a little worried because it was very crumbly. But as soon as I worked it a bit with my hands it turned into a very nice dough. I rolled the dough out with very little flour and it never stuck to the rolling pin. The cookies transferred to baking sheet very easily and maintained perfect shape during baking. They taste great, slightly crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle, just like I like them. My only criticism is that the texture of the cookie is such that you HAVE to drink a glass of milk or cup of tea with them as they leave you thirsty. I will make these every year from now on, and maybe not just at Christmas!

These are the BEST EVER.  Every time I took them to my daughters preschool her teacher would rave on them.  All the kids loved them.
They are soo soft.  The only thing I changed is that I leave the oven at 350 and only cook until they look dry on top.

This is the only sugar cookie recipe I use now.  I have been using it exclusively for almost 2 years!  They really hold their shape and they taste better than all the rest I have ever made.  I even invested in  new cookie cutters for all occasions just because these turn out so well.  I recommend greasing the cookie sheet very lightly with a little oil wiped on with a paper towel; if you don't grease it, the cookies sometimes break, and if you just spray with cooking spray, it does cause the cookies to spread a little bit and ruins the otherwise perfect shape.

Excellent recipe! My husband gave two thumbs up! I made it in two shapes, big round shape and the other I cut it into small square pieces. He preferred the square ones. I used Delilah Frosting which I got from this site. Definately a keeper. View photos.

Wonderful must try recipe! Use with Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe (on this site)! To prevent a too dry dough, gently spoon flour into cup and level off. Excellent flavor and texture! Do not overbake.

This recipe was without compare the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried! They tasted like store bought cookies (& I mean that in a GOOD way since I love those!). I doubled the recipe & used Very Vanilla Silk Soymilk instead of cream, 1 Tbsp of vanilla & 2 Tbsps of lemon juice. The kids loved them! Pair this recipe with the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" recipe by Kathy Brandt - you will be very glad you did! EXCELLENT!!! Thanks Jessica :)

WOW -- I tried this recipe today and it turned out WONDERFULLY!  The liquid was perfect -- perhaps people didn't SIFT the flour first to net out the 3 cups?  Also, I had no cream on hand so I used liquid flavored Coffee Mate and it smells and tastes terrific.  It was definitely a new technique to blend all the dry ingredients first and then cut in the butter -- I was skeptical but the cookies are DELICIOUS.  I used a frosting recipe I found on the Family Fun website: 
Ingredients
1 stick butter
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
3 tbsp. milk
Food coloring (I used Wilton's paste coloring for rich colors)

Directions


Cream 1 stick of softened butter and 3 cups of confectioners' sugar. 

Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 3 tablespoons of milk, then cream until smooth. Add desired food coloring.

This was a great recipe.  Easy to work with and delicious to eat.  The only thing I did differently was to bake them at 350 instead of 400.  I found they baked more evenly on the bottom and they didn't brown on the top and sides especially if they weren't rolled evenly. These can be used with or without icing.  They tasted great either way.

They were ok. Just ok. Not very flavorful, and were very hard and dry. A very basic basic sugar cookie recipe.

These cookies were delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and nothing needs to be changed.  They were gone in no time and my 6 year old son could not get enough of these.  I gave them away as a Christmas gift.  Delicious!!!  Thank you!!

Delicious cookies. The dough was very easy to work with and the cutout cookies hold their shape beautifully. Thanks for the great recipe - this one's replacing MY grandma's recipe (don't tell her!).

The best sugar cookie recipe.  I've been looking for a not-too-sweet, soft sugar cookie recipe for years now.  This is it! Wonderful!  I follow the recipe exactly.  The recipe was crumbly so I just kneaded it until smooth.  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I made the cookies 3 days ago for a party.  I'm eating leftovers today and they are still soft.  Biggest piece of advice is to really watch them in the oven.  They cook up very fast and if they are overcooked they will become crispy not soft.

BEST CUT-OUT RECIPE EVERRRR! 

This is the first sugar cookie cut-out recipe I've tried where the dough rolls out well and it doesn't poof up while baking, leaving me with distorted blob-shaped cookies. I did have to refrigerate the dough for about 20 minutes because it was too sticky to roll (sticking to parchment paper even!) but I didn't change the proportions at all. I might add more vanilla next time, or maybe all it needed was some icing (I only sprinkled with colored sugar and baked). I felt GREAT about this recipe and am looking forward to making cut-outs for the holidays! Grandma Minnie rocks!

I found this recipe NOT to be what everyone raved of it!  The dough was sticky, though we mixed by hand and put into refrigerator.  They took 12 minutes to bake though we cut them thin.  AND the taste was not at all what I had hoped for nor sweet enough.

I just made these cookies for the third time for holidays with my teenage daughter. I absolutely love this recipe. This is the type of sugar cookie you can actually roll thicker and cook onto a lollie-pop stick. It's great, and the only difference is in additional cooking time. The BIG bonus on this sugar cookie, as opposed to others, there is no need to refrigerate the dough before hand, it's wonderful. Highly recommend for anyone from beginners to those that have cooked for years! #1 in my book of sugar cookies:)

This is my second time reviewing.  I have been baking sugar cookies for over 30 years and this recipe is by far, the best I have used.  My hints: Wash your hands thoroughly and use your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until it is like corn meal.  Use the butter straight out the fridge.  If the dough is a little softer and shiny, chill for at least an hour  (wrapped in some saran wrap so as not to dry out).  If it is matte and like play dough, you can roll it now. Using a thin, metal spatula dusted with a little flour worked better on getting the cut-outs up than a plastic one.  I baked mine at 350 for 5 - 6 min.  This was for thinner, crisper cookies rather than soft.   Watch the batch closely and allow it to brown slightly if at all.  Allow the cookies to finish baking on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes.  Let it cool completely on the cookie rack.   I did not have cream but had a can of low-fat coconut milk and used that.  My gosh, I think that might be a secret ingredient for sure.  It added a neat creaminess and a flavor but it did not taste like coconut.

This recipe was just what I was looking for:  a not-too-sweet sugar cookie.  I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream because I didn't have cream.  They turned out perfect!

I made these cookies in a pinch because my usual recipe calls for sweetened condensed milk and I was all out, I saw it calls for cream and thought the tastes  may be similar. These cookies are very easy and VERY tasty, we enjoyed them alot maybe even too much because they lasted just 2 days! Yum and thank you!

Ok-I changed my mind- THIS is the best sugar cookie recipe! The dough was SO easy to work with- even after being in the freezer- they kept their shape while baking, and even the plain ones were so pretty because they came out a perfect light color-no overdone brown cookies. AND they were delicious! I don't like sugar cookies that much and I couldn't stop eating them. I made them with Butter Icing for Cookies from this site and tinted it red & green-perfection.

One of the best cut out sugar cookie recipe ever! I creamed the sugar and "wet ingredients" in my Kitchen Aid and then used the hook to fold in and mix the flour, salt, and baking powder. I then chilled for a couple hours and the dough was perfect for rolling out and cutting! Couldn't have been any easier to work with and the family loved the finished product.

I loved the taste of these cookies...more like shortbread, which I love.  Anyways, I had problems getting the dough to come together. I followed the recipe the best I could, dont have a pastry blender though, and it was just so dry. Any suggestions? Thanks

These were the best sugar cookies, moist and just the right amount of sweetness, even without icing. We made half of the batch chocolate, substitutuing cocoa powder for some of the flour, and they turned out great too. An unexpected butter shortage resulted in this odd combination: we used 1/2 part butter, 1/4 part Smart Balance spread, 1/4 part shortening, and to the credit of the recipe, everything still turned out well!

These were delicious! I used smart balance butter and whole milk instead of cream and they turned out wonderfully! I had a little bit of trouble rolling them out b/c the dough was slightly sticky, but I just rolled small portions of the dough between wax paper (and used plenty of flour) and stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes before cutting the shapes. This will definitely be my Christmas sugar cookie recipe from now on!

This was a little difficult at first. I tried to roll out with sugar rather than flour like some reviewers suggested. It was not an easy task. The dough was sticky even after refridgerating it. It was much easier once I used flour on the board and mixed it into the dough. These cookies had a good flavor but watch your thickness because if you roll to 1/4 inch they tend to get very crispy around the edges.Overall a good recipe.

The first time I tried this I ended up over baking the cookies, waiting for them to brown properly.  Since then I stick to 6-8 minutes depending on the thickness of the cookies and they came out great.  Sugar cookies are not my favorite, but these are very good and the dough is very easy to work with.  This is the best recipe I've ever tried for cut-out cookies.

i would have to give these three stars they are great with a sweet frosting.but they have no sweetness to them at all plus a bad after taste by themselves.also i thought the dough was not going to turn out at first cause it was sticking to my hands and i had such a mess it was so doughie.i stuck it in the freezer for 15 min in a glass bowl and it formed in to a ball .i also used cookie cutteres.i used wax paper to roll out half of my dough on and the other half i put back into the freezer until i needed it but i cut the cookies out then i just removed the excess dough popped the wax papper and all in to the oven on to a cookie sheet.be sure the wax paper is not hanging off of your cookie sheet cause it will stink your house up.but all in all my three year old did have fun cutting them out.

These Sugar Cookies were absolutely delicious! My family gobbled them all up in seconds. The only change i made was using an egg-wash to glaze the biscuits before i baked them. I whisked together an egg with a few tablespoons of milk, and carefully brushed this over the cut out buscuits. I also sprinkled sugar over them. This glaze gave the cookies a stunning golden shine, which made everyone smile!

I had been looking for a sugar cookie receipe that tasted great without icing and I have found it.  I brought it to many pot lucks and it is always a hit.  I do add a little more cream until the dough does not appear to be dry and I use sugar instead of flour to roll the cookies on.  It gives them a great sparkled effect.

I was going to call my mom for her recipe but she wasn't home so I checked out allrecipes & I'm glad I did!  This made a really nice dough that was easy to work with.  I divided the dough in half and chilled it for about 20 minutes (just enough time to clean off the counter to roll).  I turned the oven down to 350 because my first batch got too brown too fast...still edible though.  I baked for about 6-8 minutes, more for the bigger shapes.  I froze them because I wanted to frost them closer to Christmas.  I used the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe on this site and it was a perfect combination.  Will definitely be saving this recipe for the next time I make sugar cookies.

Great cookie.  I was looking for something that didn't need refridgerated because I wasn't going to actually make them just use them to take christmas pictures with.  The girls loved them and wouldn't stop eating them.  These are great.  Definately double the recipe you will want more.

These cookies are a hit among my friends and family! Once I put them out, they were all gone! I'm a teenager and I'm rather lazy, but I loved this recipe! Like many others, I needed to add a couple more tablespoons of cream. This was also my first time rolling out dough and it worked great when enough flour was used. The cut outs maintained their shape after baking. This is a definite keeper.

I just made these with my daughters and we added 3 tbls. butter and 1 tbls cream because they were kind of dry.  I didn't roll them out, just placed in balls and sprinkled and Wow!  Yummy!  We finished the first pan before the the second one came out of the oven.  Also, I had to bake for about 9 minutes since they were so thick.

I was very pleased with the taste and texture of these cookies; they were soft and practically melted in my mouth!  This is one of the better recipes that I have found for a soft sugar cookie and I will likely make them again.  While the cookies did maintain their cut shape very well, they did puff up which, while making a tender and buttery cookie, made the tops a little less attractive than they were when I first put them in the oven, hence only four stars.  Other than that, I loved the texture and taste of these wonderful sugar cokies!

I have tried so many recipes for sugar cookies and am rarely pleased with any of them. However, these were so easy and quick to make and tasted delicious. In addition to the cream I added two tablespoons of sourcream. The cookies turned out slightly crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. 6 min. was the perfect time for my cookies rolled out to 1/4". I frosted them with my Mother-in-law's recipe:1/2 C. butter,3Cpowdered sugar, 1tsp.almond extract, pinch of salt and add cream to desired consistency.I got so many compliments that I think my search for a sugar cookie recipe is over. Thank you!

This was an excellent recipe.  I was looking for a recipe I could use to make Christmas cookies with my 2 yr old son.  These were super easy and very tasty.  The only change I made was to add additional cream to the mixture . As other reviewers had indicated it was far too dry with the amount stated.  My husband thought they were so good he asked me to make more!!!
Thanks Jessica for a great recipe. It's definately a keeper.

Excellent cookie dough recipe.  My kids (5 & 2) and I used it for our cut-out cookies -- easy, fast, and had a great taste and texture. The kids helped make it, roll it, etc. without any problems. I have to admit that I creamed the butter, sugar and eggs, added the other liquid ingredients and then added the dry; it still seemed to be fine.  Used with the recipe for "Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies" -- this is what we'll use from now on.  THANKS!!!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  The only thing I change was the amount of cream; I thought the recipe needed just a little more. I also added some lemon zest.  Makes very yummy Christmas cookies with or without the frosting!

I found this cookie dough to be perfectly moist and pliable with the amount of liquid given.  Perhaps the prior complaints of a crumbly dough were due to the size of the eggs used, or the time of year/temp/humidity when the cookies were made. I guess the key is to play it by ear and adjust as necessary. This seems like a reliable recipe to be used again.  The finished cookies had a great taste and texture.

This recipie is fantastic!  I made it last night and chilled it in the fridge overnight.  I do think that its easier to work with warmed dough though.  I also added an extra T of Light Cream (we use it in our coffee, otherwise I think that this recipe would be just fine with milk).  The cream gives them a rich flavor.  In addition I substituted one cup of Whole Wheat flour for one of the all purpouse cups for some nutrition.  I also made these eggless (my husband and my daughter are allergic) using 1T soy flour, 2T water and they still came out wonderful! I must have big cookie cutters because I only got 54 cookies though... This recipe is definatly a keeper! Thanks Jessica!

These were the worst cookies ever!! Followed the recipe exactly. We ended up throwing them out. What a waste of time and money.  Couldn't roll them. They kept sticking to a "well floured" board.  The end results were cookies that tasted awful.  What a terrible experience!!  Were counting on these for Christmas.  After yesterday, I am done with cut outs for awhile.

I was looking for a recipe that was simple and that would make nice cut outs. I made yellow moons and blue stars. The food coloring distributed beautifully throughout the dough. It rolled and cut well and did not spread out in the pan. I did not have cream so I used whipped cream. I used extra vanilla (I always go when I bake)These cookies were a big hit with all age groups and I will be keeping this recipe on hand!

finally I found the exact recipe we have had in our family for years but the pencil faded on the card and it was no longer visable! I have looked and looked and finally found the exact same ingredients and the exact same way of mixing it together. Thank you so much for posting this since I have to make these every year during the winter, ever since I was a little girl, and now I am 53 so you know this is an old family favorite! We always sprinkled with colored sugar before baking, they need nothing else! I do add more vanilla since I think the flavoring tends to bake out. by the way the recipe card was originally written back in the 1950's I think, it may be even older! I do want to note I added alot more vanilla.

These are absolutely delicious. I assembled them a little bit differently, I creamed the butter in my KitchenAid mixer, then sifted the dry ingredients into the bowl in stages. This seems to have kept the dough from being dry or crumbly as some people have said, as the butter was pretty thoroughly melted into it. As I was rolling it out I kept the bowl in the fridge to keep the rest of the dough from getting too sticky. Baked them as suggested by the recipe, perfection. Frosted some of them with a butter icing I lifted from an apple pastry recipe as suggested by some other folks (can't remember exactly which one, sorry!) and that was an excellent compliment to them. But these don't need the icing, they are great on their own. Oh, I did swap the cream for 2% milk as I didn't want to buy a carton of cream just for these, as I knew the rest would go to waste in my house.

I've been making my cutout cookies with this recipe for about 3 years now, and I'm so glad I found it! I use the measurements the recipe gives, and I mix everything with my hands (I think the heat from my hands helps melt the butter at the beginning, and since they're already messy I mix in the liquid ingredients with my hands too). You have to mix and mix and mix until the dough isn't crumbly anymore. It takes a while to mix thoroughly and become smooth dough, so hang in there! I sprinkle some colored sugar on them before I bake them, and keep a close eye on the cookies in the oven, because they will burn fast once they brown. The end result is an amazingly delicious sugar cookie! Great recipe! The only sugar cookie recipe I'll use from now on!

This is a good, basic cookie.  It has a nice flavour and crunch.  I found I had to add an extra tablespoon of cream because the dough was a bit dry, but that was the only thing I did different with this recipe.  The dough handles well and is perfect for using cookie cutters.  My only advice would be not to use small cookie cutters.  I used a combination of small (~1 1/2 to 2" in diameter) and larger ones.  Also, roll is out a little thicker than 1/8".  The cookies shrink and when they are little, they really are little.  :)

Thank you Grandma Minnie! Finally a good recipe where the cookies turn out soft and yummy. However... it does not make 78 servings! I would say a conservative amount would be 4 dozen. :)

GREAT recipe, thank you!It is my first time to try baking cookies.The dough was very easy to work with(I didn't chill it), the kids had fun cutting the shapes. I used almond essence instead of vanilla and they turned out perfect. I will definitely make these again and again!

I tried 3 other recipes on this site in search for the perfect cutout recipe.  I need to search no further, this is it!  I believe the reason is the way the butter is blended into the dry ingredients.  My cookies were crisp and flavorful.  Thank you.

Great recipe!  I didn't have cream so just used skim milk and they turned out fine.  Not an overly sweet cookie.  Great for rolling for cutout cookies.  After adding all the ingredients as instructed, I just worked the dough with my hands which worked pretty good before rolling it out.  Baked them for 6 minutes.  Next time I'll try adding Almond extract for more taste.

I followed this recipe to the letter and got absolutely perfect cookies. The recipe, if you make it exactly as stated, makes a dough that is the perfect consistency for rolling out. It was neither too wet or too dry -- it was pliable (like Play-Doh) but not at all sticky. I rolled the dough out with a flour-dusted rolling pin, dusted to surface with sugar and got the kids in to help me cut out the Christmas shapes.  The finished cookie is delicious; a little on the "cake-y" side even when rolled out to 1/8-inch but with a lovely crisp bottom. Be sure to watch them carefully and don't overcook. I cooked each batch for about 6 minutes (7 minutes was a tiny bit too long for medium-sized cookie shapes). We decorated them with coloured icing and the taste was perfect - the dough itself is not too sweet, so the icing-sugar glaze was a good complement. Overall, an excellent recipe. I'm saving it on my computer, printing it out for my cookbook, and emailing it to myself so I will never lose it!

After realizing I needed to mix the final dough for several minutes for it to become dough, these were very simple to make.  They have a wonderful flavor.  I rolled them out a little thicker because I like a thick cookie.

If you are looking for a cookie that tastes like sugar, these are NOT for you. They taste more like shortbread. I followed the recipe exactly and these came out better than I could have hoped for. You will be tempted to add additional liquids as the dough is very dry....DON'T DO IT! The trick is to work the dough with your hands allowing the butter to melt slightly. I worked the dough for a bit in the bowl then took out baseball size balls of dough to work on a floured surface. After a few minutes it was perfect. Like others have said, watch them carefully in the oven as they can go from brown to burnt very quickly!

Wonderful taste, texture and time!  These were great for cutouts, were quick to make and easy to decorate.  They taste great as well.  This is our only sugar cookie recipe now. 
  Take note though- we don't get anywhere near 6 dozen cookies.  If we were doing small circle cooies, maybe 3 dozen.

This is a really good recipe. The mixture ends up very dry, so I added 1 tsp almond extract and then slowly added half & half (my "cream" substitue) until it was the consistency I wanted. Not a super sweet cookie, which I like.

Great recipe!  Basic, easy to follow and delicious!  Excellent for cut outs too...we used Halloween cookie cutters but I'll be making these again for Christmas.  Best of all, you don't have to chill the dough before rolling, just mix it with your hands to form a ball.

This recipe makes the most unusual sugar cookies, more like a biscuit than a cookie taste. Not sugar-y at all, but more buttery tasting. I added some lemon zest and lemon juice and had to add more water to make the dough come together. Very easy to roll and cut into cutouts (angels, bells, and Christmas trees). Tasted like a biscuit until I put frosting on the cookies and now they are palatable.

Without a doubt the best roll & cut sugar cookie recipe ever.  Not at all sticky and the cookies turn out consistently attractive and the texture is lovely, even on the last few cookies when you've reworked the dough and incorporated the inevitable additional flour from the board.  This one is a keeper!

This is a really good sugar cookie.  I am an inexperienced baker and I only got 38 cookies out of the recipe.  My kids and I enjoyed making them and they tasted great too.  I really only needed 6 1/2 minutes in my convection oven at that temp.

I made this cookies for my son's cub scout x-mas party and they loved them.  Did put the dough in the freezer for about 20mins and baked them for 15mins but they came out great. Crispy on the outside edges but soft enough to melt in your mouth.

This was a pretty good sugar cookie recipe but the cookies came out a little bit hard even when I decreased the oven temp and cooking time.  I was hoping to have a more chewy cookie.  Adding a tsp. of almond extract in addition to the vanilla helped enhance the flavor.

My search is over... I found the perfect sugar cut-out cookies.  I did use 3 t vanilla, whipped, 4 T heavy whipping cream, 1/4 t almond extract & 1 ½ t butter flavoring, used 1 t coconut flavoring in 
cookie dough for added flavor.  My husband was eating my the handful without frosting.  MMMMM he kept humming from the next room.  New family favorite.  Thanks for sharing...

Awesome recipe, perfect consistency from how I remembered them when my mom made them. They do suck up the flour on the counter if you're rolling them out for cookie cutter shapes. I'd put some sugar down next time as someone recommended as it would add that perfect sweet *kiss* to the cookie. Very enjoyable.

Great sugar cookie recipe.  I chilled one batch before rolling out but not the other, and they both seemed easy to work with.  Next time I will not bother to chill the dough.  I made these cookies for my son's 3rd birthday along with the "sugar cookie icing" recipe and had at least 3 people ask me for the recipe.  Cookies had a nice sweet taste.  They were soft and yet they held their shape well.

This is a great recipe,very forgiving and fast with no chilling needed. I mixed like a typical recipe, creamed butter and sugar, added eggs one at a time ect. and it worked very well. I also added a little nutmeg with the dry. The dough worked well even after several handling. Loved this recipe!!!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY with the exception of sifting (gave that up long ago). I did lightly scoop up the flour from the canister as someone else suggested. The dough was not dry at all. After I put the ingredients all together I threw it in my stand mixer and let 'er rip for about 30 seconds; the dough came together and was perfect. This was probably one of the easiest/fastest cookie recipes I've ever tried. I rolled them into balls and used a cookie stamp which didn't work too well because the tops were a tad bumpy. Sprinkled them with colored sugar and they were gone by the next morning! Great recipe!

Even my husband (who is not a baker) had success with this recipe! I chose not to chill this dough and it still worked very well. We rolled a nice, thin, crisp and sweet cookie. We chose to ice with an almond glaze that dries hard instead of sprinkling it with sugar. Delicious! We've been using this recipe for two or three years now. Fantastic!!

I made a dairy-free version (allergies) and it was still a spectacular recipe!  4 tbsp rice milk instead of cream and whey free margarine instead of butter.  I also made them large and thick which made 30 cookies total.  I baked them 7 minutes and they were chewy and delicious.

Great basic recipe for sugar cookies.  I added lemon juice b/c of personal preference, which made the dough a little more sticky than it should have been.  My only suggestion would be to watch these cookies closely while in the oven.  5 minutes on 400 degrees was perfect for mine.

Pros:
Tastes perfect, forgiving (I added too much baking powder and it was still great), easy to roll, cookies keep sharp edges in oven
Cons:
By the time I "test" the dough and baked cookies, there aren't nearly as many as the recipe says, bad for waistline, hard to teach children to share when you want to eat them all.

Try this recipe with 1/2 tsp Pandan flavoring (in Asian markets) instead of vanilla for green cookies and a wonderful nutty flavor.

Not worth the effort. unlike other reviewers, I did not need to add extra cream.The dough was fine following the recipe exactly. I chilled it for 3 hours. If you can't roll out a pie crust, don't even try this recipe. Even cold, it stuck so much I had to add way too much flour to get it to roll out without sticking; then I lost my religion trying to get it off the board once you'd cut it with the cutter and I had great difficulty keeping the dough the shape of the cutter. I knew adding so much flour on the board would probably ruin the flavor and it did. Frankly, I wish I'd just cheated and used the store bought dough; it couldn't have tasted worse and it would have saved me an hour.

This is one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've ever tried.  They hold their shape well yet are soft and chewy.  I did make a revision to the recipe by using 6 tablespoons of cream instead of 3.  The mix was too dry made with only 3 tablespoons of cream.  I did roll mine thicker than called so I did not get 6 to 7 dozen cookies -- maybe 4 dozen.  But who could tell because we were eating them as soon as they were cool!

I really liked these cookies, but agree that they are not very sweet.  I also rolled them thick, 1/4".  I would probably roll them a little thinner, but not much.  I  made a simple glaze with powdered sugar and water to give the cookie a more uniform surface (they don't have a smooth texture when they come out of the oven).  This cookie can definitely handle a lot of frosting.  I think they are fantastic with  melted semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Next time I may just dip them in chocolate.  The cookies are soft and cakey, exactly the way I like them.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe box. :)

Wonderful wonderful cookie.  Rolled out like a dream, and didn't need to add a lot of flour to roll out.  I thought dough which was not chilled rolled out better.  Baked at 350 for 7 to 8 minutes.  I prefer thinner cookies, cook up nice and crispy.  Absolutely delicious.  Will be our sugar cookie recipe from now on.  Thank you so much Jessica for this recipe!!  Happy Holidays everyone.

This recipe turned out excellent for using cookie cutters.  The only change I made was using vanilla carmel coffee creamer in place of the cream called for.  It gave it a wonderful flavor!

WONDERFUL recipe!!!  I absolutely DREAD making sugar cookies, because the dough is always too sticky or too hard or too crumbly, etc... this is the first recipe I've found that can be rolled out at room temperature and doesn't fall apart on me.  I rolled them out on a pastry cloth and had great resultes.  This is my new sugar cookie recipe, and I'm thrilled.

I hate making sugar cookies, they never turn out right, they never hold their shapes etc...
Not anymore these cookies were perfect.  Easy to roll out easy to transfer to the cookie sheet.  And yummy too.  I did use 2% milk because it was what I had.
Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper.

These were the perfect cookies.  I couldn't believe how easy the dough was to work with even without being chilled.  I used powdered sugar instead of flour when I rolled them. I did have a little trouble getting them off the pan, so I think I will use parchment paper next time.  This recipe went straight to my "use all the time" recipe file.

This cookie has every excellent quality the submitter said it does, and will have a place in my freezer constantly. So....I am wondering, um, since the only difference was that I always cook with Smart Balance instead of butter for our arteries...I have a hunch the one who had trouble may have not followed directions. I suspect they didn't put the cookies 2" apart? Or perhaps, melted the butter instead of room temperature and then greased the cookie sheet? I'd surely recommend giving it another try, as these are superb cookies, simple, and I bet I can add other good things to the recipe, as the submitter said, "This is the only cookie recipe you will ever need."

Good, but these have a very slight, unusual sour note.  Maybe they need more sugar?  I'm not sure why, but I'll have to investigate the cause before making this recipe again.

Perfect sugar cookie. Simple and easy. I really liked it because they weren't too sweet, and then I added icing for the sweet tooths in the family. I didn't have cream, so I just used milk and it worked out perfect. Will be making these again!

These are really good cookies! The flavor was not too sweet and very buttery. We had a little trouble getting the dough to stick, so we added a little extra cream. The cookies held the shape of the cookie cutters really well.

This recipe is perfection! I followed exactly - but did mix in my KitchenAid. For those KA addicts like me - just mix the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar on stir speed, then add the butter (cold and cut into big chunks) beat until crumbly on same speed, then add the partial beaten egg, vanilla and cream (I used half and half). I used the paddle attachment. The dough came together perfectly, not too soft, not too hard. The cookies baked perfectly in about 7 minutes and I let them cool before frosting. These were delicious even without the frosting. This one's a keeper for sure - thank you, Jessica, for sharing!

These are good - most importantly, they mix up easily and we really like that you can roll and cut them right away - no waiting for the dough to chill!  I did follow the mixing instructions the first time, and the second time I was distracted - I did put in all the dry ingredients and then accidentally added the butter, sugar and liquids all at once - it still turned out great.  (I know the science behind why you do things in a certain order, but was thankful these turned out anyway!)

I love baking so it was no problem baking it and everyone I new loved it. the only changes I made was that I decided to add more vanilla extract and  a helpful hand of kit Kat bars crunched into powder.

I’ve tried several well-reviewed recipes for sugar cookies, and this is by far the best!  I made it exactly as suggested (with the pastry cutter); I love that it’s really easy and I don’t need to get my mixer dirty.  As other suggested, just stir in the wet ingredients until blended — Don’t overwork the dough.  I refrigerated overnight for simplicity’s sake, and the dough warmed up and rolled out well the next day with a little effort (I did it in sections and kept the rest in the fridge).  I rolled it out with granulated sugar as others suggested, which worked great and added a little extra sweetness.  Cooked fast, held the cut-out impressions well, and tastes great even without icing.  Thank you!!!

Great cookies.  Making them again this year.  

NOTE:  I found this EXACT recipe in my 1963 copy of the Pillsbury Cookbook.  I am a vintage cookbook collector and always like to use older recipes when I can.  Perhaps Great Grandma Minnie used this book as well!

There are few reviews-stars i like to give this recipe actually ... the taste is good so for 4* for that, however, to make the dough was very frustrating to make. After a good 20min of hand mixing it still was very very dry, not sure how it was so sticky for others  ...so i had to add another spoon of cream-and as i was making it i had to add another in order to stick together and roll ... and even that was a challenge to roll in one piece as it was cracking.....  i bake a lot and i love baking , but this one was of the most frustrating dough to put together and roll....
The picture on the recipe is also not relevant as there is not recipe for the glaze-as that is what one only see when looking at the photo- i like to see what the dough is suppose to look like when baked too-which i really cant tell from this photo -full of glaze ....it almost looks like that the recipe going with this photo should be the one of the glaze.... anyhow...so to make the dough and the texture i give 2 *, it took way too long to make it smooth enough to cut few shapes -had to do it in batches as there was no way to roll a full dough at once without everything coming apart....  I will keep looking for another recipe for sugar cookies -as even though the end test was fine ...to make it was very frustrating for me...with dough falling apart constantly ....and too time consuming for a simple recipe as this ...

They turn out perfect every time! I roll them out with icing sugar (so they don't get tough) and bake for 6 minutes.

This is also Great-aunt Lottie's recipe with these changes:
No cream but two eggs instead of one
Lemon extract instead of vanilla.  
I think you'll like what the lemon does, or use both.  Unlike what others have written, I've found a Mixmaster works fine.   If the dough is too stiff and climbs the beaters of your mixer, probably the butter was cold.  It'll get better as you work it.  And the writer is right, make 'em thin!  My granddaughters like to make them with me, though their tastes in decorating can be odd.  Oh, and if you put flour atop the dough ball before rolling, it won't be sticky, but you can do this only about three times before the dough gets too floury.

This is a great cutout cookie recipe. Perfect cookies for kids to decorate! We've been making them every Christmas for a few years now. One year, I didn't have any cream so I used eggnog. It added such a wonderful subtle flavor that my family won't let me use anything else now!

Absolutely delicious! I did struggle with making these as I don't have any mixers (not even hand ones) so it was a long, laborious recipe to make. There was a lot of flour/sugar crumbs that fell by the wayside for whatever reason, but that wasn't such a problem.

This has become our family Go-To recipe for sugar cookies. I walked my granddaughter through the recipe one time, and now she's our cookie baker.  We do chill the dough. We don't roll to 1/8" because that is too thin for us. Ours are maybe 1/4" thick. Our baker likes to make shapes by hand in addition to using cookie cutters. The dough doesn't get "tough" with the excess handling a creative 13-year-old needs to do.

These cookies turned out absolutely perfect! Simple recipe with ingredients you probably already have on hand. The only change I made was the addition of 1/2 tsp almond extract- it really enhanced the flavor. The texture of these cookies was perfect. I chilled the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes before cutting. They held their shape beautifully in the oven! This will now be my go-to sugar cookie recipe. No more mixes for this mama!! Thanks so much for sharing.

Compliments from everyone.  Very easy to make.  I divided dough into two sections and wrapped in Cling Wrap in the fridge for an hour.  Very easy to roll out. I haven't made sugar cookies in over 20 years. With this recipe, I'll make them regularly.

This will be my go to sugar cookie from now on. I noticed some reviews mentioned this was dry, but as others have said if you knead it with your hands it is not. They are perfect for using cookie cutters with.

Made this for the first time today, had to come find a recipe because I have misplaced my old recipe. This recipe is a decent substitute until I can find my other recipe, though not as sweet as my standby cookies. I have a Kitchen-Aid mixer with a very low "STIR" setting, so doing it by mixer worked for me. The dough came together very well and was easy to work with (even if slightly crumblier than I am used to, but only very slightly). Overall, I have nothing to complain about with this recipe other than I still prefer my recipe given to me by my grandmother out of her cookbook.

Used the electric hand blender since I do not have a pastry blender. Turned out dry so I added another tbs or so of cream and folded it in. It was good to roll out 3 times, but crumbled on the 4th. Also, had to leave them in the oven for 12 minutes rather than 8, but thats probably because they were thicker than recommended. Overall, good recipe and I think i will come back to it again :)

I made these tonight because I did not have buttermilk in the house to make my normal roll out soft sugar cookies.   These are a crispier sugar cookie than my normal.  I used a traditional buttercream icing and they are very good.  I have to admit, I couldn't do as called for in the recipe, I creamed the butter and sugar, then added egg, vanilla, milk, and then dry. I also upped the vanilla to 1.5 t, just because I love vanilla.    I did not scoop the flour out with the cup, but measured it spooning it into the cup - this is perhaps where some people get too much flour and feel the recipe is dry.  It was not dry, the dough was perfect.   I ended up making balls and smashing them with a floured glass.  I got exactly 3 dozen nice sized cookies.   Baked at 375 for 8 minutes because I feel my oven runs a little warm.    Also, I did use a hand mixer, but....I used dough hooks and used the lowest setting, so it was more  like mixing it by hand.    I also used Irish butter because it is what I had on hand.    My daughter just had one and declared them delicious.

Great sugar cookies. Followed recipe except I used parchment paper (to keep from burning the bottoms). Took them to Christmas cookie decorating party. Everyone loved them. Not too hard like sugar cookies I've made in the past, but firm enough to decorate.

These were crisp and tasty! We Made them for Christmas and everyone loved them. Here's a tip for rolling out sugar cookies: instead of using flour to dust the dough and workspace, use powdered sugar. It works like a charm. Thank you!

For the first time I have made and tasted sugar cookies and I am impressed. Great recipe!!! Fast, easy and really worth it. Dough seemed slightly sticky, but once it was on the floured surface, it was easy to spread and cut. Cookies baked lovely in exactly 8 minutes, and they did not change a shape. They have rich vanilla flavor and are pleasantly sweet. And my house smells like vanilla and Christmas even few hours after baking them!!! I will definitelly make them each Hollidays. Thank you for sharing.

This is a really good recipe but make the cookies small not big and put some nuts in the cookie that would be good
These are really good With nuts!

I agree with another  poster - these need at least 8 stars maybe 10!
Best sugar cookies ever. The only change I made was more vanilla. 1 tbs instead of one tsp and one drop of orange oil to brighten the flavor

This recipe was delish and it was good for the whole family. Now I will never search for a sugar cookie recipe. I noticed shortbread taste but this still is amazing.

I tried a couple of recipes this year for sugar cookies and this was my favorite. They tasted great! The dough was a little hard to work with at first, but after handling it and adding flour, it was easier to work with.

This was a perfect recipe when my daughter decided she wanted to make sugar cookies! She's only 2 and has no patience for refrigerating the dough. This dough doesn't need refrigeration and is easy to roll out and cut! Plus, they're yummy!

I'm rating these on based on a comparison of what I wanted from these to what I got. I was looking for a relatively thick sugar cookie that could be used for cutouts. I got the exact opposite. The dough was nearly impossible to work with because it was so sticky, even after refrigerating for several hours. After baking, the cookies were super thin and delicate and not very easy to work with. Also, this has a more buttery flavor than a sugar cookie flavor. What I found in summary is this: you must bake sufficiently or they will just crumble (until the edges are pretty brown). These are more of a delicate teacake. I wouldn't frost them again. It just doesn't work with the flavor. Maybe some kind of light glaze, or they are just great plain. I'm definately keeping this recipe, but as a butter cookie. I will continue looking for a staple sugar cookie recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe. I think the dough was a little to sticky to do cut outs, but I'm a little impatient when it comes to those anyway. So just rolled in to ball and flatten with a glass. The other half of the dought I added 1/2C chopped hazelnuts. made the cookie the same way. Then made sandwich cookies using Nutella and then dipped half in semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkled with more hazelnuts. YUM!

Seem to be a little sticky, but may be due to my splitting the recipe in half and still having to use one egg. Anyway, all I had to do was add a little extra flour. No biggie. They're delicious!

Delicious and easy.
Because the recipe calls to 'cut in' the butter, I thought it should be chilled. My bad. It wouldn't blend until the butter warmed up.
I added 1 tsp. of almond extract because I like the flavor. They taste GREAT and were quick and easy to make. Thank you for sharing this great recipe. This was my 4 year old grandson's first time making cookies for Santa. I guarantee that Santa won't leave a single crumb on the plate ;¬D

These cookies are very easy to make.  We chilled some of the dough briefly (mainly because there was so much that I couldn't roll it all out at once), but it rolled out well at room temperature.
We made one batch with butter flavored crisco and vanilla soy milk because I am allergic to dairy -- and they came out fine.

I tried this recipe based on the large number of glowing reviews.  I followed it exactly as written.  The dough was sticky and difficult to work with, even after refrigerated for 3 hours.  This was a real problem for my cookie baking party with young children.  I will say that it was tasty and the cookies kept their shape nicely.  But I won't be using it again.

These cookies turned out great! I did choose to chill the dough for about an hour, and I had no problems rolling and cutting out the dough afterwards. The taste is good, and they are super easy to make!

My 3 year old daughter wanted to make some star shaped cookies and I found this recipe that easy for her to mix, roll, and cut.  They turned out great!  We followed the recipe exactly...so easy and quick.  However, after the first attempt at rolling and cutting out shapes we dedided to chill the dough for an hour and it was much easier the roll and cut.  Happy child...and great cookies...who can ask for more? (o:

Very very VERY good cookies...  A bit difficult to handle at first.  Rolling them just a bit thicker helped.  Once I thought to roll between sheets of waxed paper it was simple.  Really good taste, texture and appearance.  My new standard sugar cookie recipe for sure.

Absolutely terrific cookies!  I did take someone's advice and set the oven to 375°.  Used Sugar Cookie Frosting and they were a huge hit!  Substituted French Vanilla Coffee Creamer for cream - will be making these cookies alot!

This is the absolute BEST sugar cookies recipe!  The cookies turned out so good that we had to keep them at home and send a bag of lollipops for dd´s preschool class because we had eaten half or them already, lol.
I didn´t use a pastry beater, only my hands and felt the dough moist enough.

This was a great sugar cookies recipe.  The dough was very forgiving.  My sister noticed the odd flavor in the background, but it didn't bother me that much.  All in all, it was the best sugar cookie I've ever made and I will be making it again every year at Christmas.

One word FRUSTRATING! 
I am going to scrap the whole batch. They taste alright if you like a cookie with the texture of a cracker and not to mention even after handling and smoothing them out they still look very ugly nothing like regular sugar cookies. Would I make these cookies again? Not a chance. I really hate being the sender of bad news in this case bad reviews but i would not reccomend this recipe to anyone...

These cookies were very good although I was looking for a little bit sweeter sugar cookie recipe.  
The dough was very easy to work with.  I made them with a Buttercream Icing recipe from this site.  I'd make these again.

I was so excited for this recipe. I read many reviews before deciding to use this particular one and I am now sooooo disappointed. Everything about the recipe was great... except for the taste. We followed the directions precisely, the dough was wonderful, and they baked beautifully. However, they have a very distinct, almost sour taste to them. We cannot put on finger on what it is, but even the wonderfully sweet icing we made cannot cover it!

The recipe was great! This was my first time making sugar cookies and it was very easy and the cookies turned out wonderful! The dough was a little dry, so in the future I might add a little more cream.

This recipe was great I have used it 4 times now and plan on making it a few more times before the holiday.  I have passed it on to many people.  If you have kids...these are great. You don't have to wait to make them.  Wonderful wonderful

My kids and I had a blast making these, the only thing i changes was i added Rice milk instead of cream and used Fleshmans margerine (my son can't have milk or soy) They had a blast decorating them and handing them out to family members i also froze some of the dough for later use.

My Grandson and I made these cookies for his preschool class.  He had a great time making them as well as eating them.  In fact, I am making a second batch now.  They are great.  One thing I did do was to roll them out in sugar instead of flour and then added sprinkles to bake.  They are delicious.

These are very good cookies.  The dough is wonderful, easy to roll out and the dough cuts easily for the cookie cutters.  I made 2 batches.  One turned out perfect and tasted wonderful.  The other batch also turned out perfect but did not taste too good.  I forgot to add the sugar!  Ha Ha, don't do like I did on the second batch!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  The dough was fantastic so, I had high hopes but once it baked the cookies were hard& crunchy.  I took special care not to let them get too thin when I rolled them and even used a silpat mat to help the cookies cook evenly.  Definitely not a winner in my book.

Wow! I finally found my sugar cookies!! These are great for cut-outs, really hold their shape perfectly, even for intricate detailed cutters. So soft and chewy just how I like them. Had to double+ the cream. Not very sweet, so may add nutmeg or cinnamon next time. Great to compliment your favorite frosting!! A KEEPER!!! Thanks Jessica

Just made this recipe 3 times because my cookie cutter was extra large. I followed the recipe directions, then found out I was out of milk(Used Coffeemate, like another review) and I could not be more pleased.The Baking Powder does make them rise and a little doughie, if your cut outs are on the thick side...but that's the bakers error not the recipe! :) Thanks for a Keeper, Jessica!

this recipe was awesome. when I made it I added food coloring so it will be funner to eat and bake. also the recipe was quick and simple,and I love that you don't have to chill it. I made the dough then I froze it, so I can pop it the oven after dinner, you can also use maple syrup instead of vanlli.but like I said these cookies were awesome, and I will definately use these recipe again!

Very good, basic, old timey sugar cookie.  Not too sweet either.  I used a shamrock cookie cutter and plan to decorate them for St. Patrick's day.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Jessica!

searched and searched on here for a good recipe with good reviews and chose this one. found that i had to add more cream to the mixture because it was really dry with the recomended amout of three tablespoons. i ended up adding three more to make six. i read reviews and found others had the same problem. have not had time to bake yet will do tomorrow. but can tell you the dough smells better than any sugar cookie dough that i have made before. hope i wont be disapointed.

Delicious sugar cookies!  I had to add more cream than the recipe called for (not sure what happened, but my dough was very dry).  I will definitely make these again.

I made these cookies last night for my 7 year olds Chirstmas Dinner at her school.  I followed the recipe exactly but after all the ingredients were in the bowl, it was like there was not enough liquid.  I added a little more milk (I didn't have cream) and they were a little on the sticky side.  Had to add more flour.  The cookies were bland even though I added almond flavouring...thank goodness I did.  Will not try these again.

These cookies were easy to make, the dough was easy to work with, and they came out tasty. The only problem was that they became bumpy after they were baked -- so they don't look very pretty if you don't frost them.

The cookies turned out very cute - hold shape well - in fact maybe too well - they don't rise at all.  Tasty, although a little on the bland side, but cut-out cookies are all about the look in my opinion.  Adding the Sugar Cookie Icing makes them great!  Definitely need to watch the temp and baking time.  I baked them 350 for 7 minutes and they were perfect.

Fantastic cookies!! As soon as the dough was forming, I could tell this was exactly what I was looking for.  Don't need to chill before rolling.  Lovely pliable dough and not too sticky. First time I think I actually rolled something to 1/8 inch!  

PS I got those rubber bands that come in different thicknesses to go around the rolling pin to help you roll evenly and to the right thickness and they really do work.  Only you can't roll out a really big piece of dough.

For the first time ever, I actually enjoyed baking cookies! (I usually find that, after hours of work, my family eats most of the cookies before they're all finished cooling--leaving me with only a handful of cookies and a very messy kitchen.)  I ended up making 2 batches since my large cutters didn't yield enough cookies in one batch.  For the first batch I used Land O' Lakes' soft baking butter, and I used regular butter for the second batch.  The results were pretty much the same, although I think the second batch was a little easier to work with.  I rolled each batch in portions, keeping the rest of the dough in the fridge while I worked.  I didn't decorate them with sugar, so I didn't find them overly sweet.  I think I'm going to glaze them-- if I can hide them from the fam long enough! :)

Fabulous!  I wanted to make some sugar cookies with my two year old that were fast, easy, and yummy!  Boy did I stubble upon the perfect recipe.
