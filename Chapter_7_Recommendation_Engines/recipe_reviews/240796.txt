WOW! We loved this!  Used turkey instead of buffalo and it came out so moist and flavorful!  It became surprisingly sweet with the sauteed veggies.  I have made this a few times now... forgot the eggs and it still came out great.  Sometimes I throw in grated zucchini and carrots.  Also, sometimes I substitute uncooked whole wheat couscous for the quinoa, it soaks up all the moisture from the veggies and low-fat turkey and keeps it nice and moist!

So tasty and easy!  I made it with butternut squash chunks and roasted red pepper (I didn't have any fresh).  I also used more ketchup instead of BBQ sauce on the top.  Delicious!  I'm not a meatloaf fan, but I am looking forward to making this again!

This is OMG good, I will make this again, and again. Very moist and the flavors, the aroma of sweetness fills the air as it bakes and screams yum!

This was a delicious alternative to regular meatloaf. I used ground turkey.   I used buffalo wing sauce instead of barbecue sauce, added chopped jalapeños, increased spices, and a bit more kale.  We like spicy, hence the jalapeños.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband loved it!

This is ridiculously tasty!  I doubled the Worcestershire and loaded up on the herbs.  In a convection oven it only took 50minutes.  My dinner guests loved it and asked for the link to the recipe.  It's a keeper.
