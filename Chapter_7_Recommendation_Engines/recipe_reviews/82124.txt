I tried this recipe for baking the wontons in lieu of deep frying them, and they turned out wonderful!
I will no longer deep fry wontons since baking them makes them so good and non-greasy.

I followed the recipe to a tee, but found that something just didn't taste right-- I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar (I find that canned crab lacks the sweetness that fresh seafood usually has) and that made a huge difference.

I halved the recipe and used a regular muffin tin not mini and they turned out fine.  Very unique taste and quite good.

This recipe was a great success at our Thanksgiving dinner party yesterday.  Everyone enjoyed them so much that I had to forward this recipe to 9 guests.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

Will definitely use this recipe again.  I didn't have water chestnuts or curry powder so I added extra green onions and I used cajun seasoning.  They were really good.  I doubled the amount of cajun seasoning and lemon juice that the recipe called for based on bland reviews.  It still could have used more.  The mayo was a little overpowering.  Very festive and easy though so it was worth five stars.

These were very good. I used canned chicken instead of crab and added a little extra curry. I didn't trim the wonton skins. I just pinched the tops of them. The water chestnuts add a great crunch to these wontons.

I make these appetizers without the curry powder and water chestnuts.  I substitute the wontons for pre-baked phyllo cups (found in the frozen section). I fill the phyllo cups with the mixture and bake on a baking sheet. I usually need to double or triple the recipe because it is the most popular appetizer at my parties.

These are really good. I left the water chestnuts off several because my daughter doesn't like them but I think the crunch in contrast to the soft filling is a must. I mixed ingredients the day before and quickly assembled after guests arrived. This worked extremely well and will make often.

I think this would have turned out  A LOT better if I haven't spilt the salt in the mixture.  However, my family did eat all of the wontons.  I may give this recipe another try when I get the craving!

Excellent - I used just a hint of curry as a lot of people don't like it.  I finely diced water chestnuts and added to mix.  I didn't trim corners off and it gave guests somthing to hang on to while eating.  Watch baking tho - corners can brown very fast.

A bit time consuming to trim the wonton skins but was worth it.  Very tasty, fun, and loved the curry!  Definitely a keeper.

Although I did like the crunch the water chestnut added, I was not crazy about the filling.  The combination of the mayonnaise and the swiss cheese made the filling greasy and heavy.  I won't be making this again - I personally think the cream cheese/crab wonton fillings are much better.

I left out the curry, added some Cajun seasoning, and doubled the ginger. I used 1/3 cup of mayo instead of 1/2 a cup, and I used light mayo. I also used fake crab.  It's great that they're baked and not fried!

This recipe gets a 4 instead of a 5 only because of long it takes to put it all together. Definitely worth it, but not something I could do too regularly.

It was good, but we had a hard time stuffing the wontons so we ended up dipping it in the left over filling. Good still but not my favorite.

These were good and very easy to prepare, but I feel like something is missing. They are a little plain for my taste. Maybe more curry and/or lemon juice? Any suggestions are welcome.

added old bay and eliminated the extra salt.
