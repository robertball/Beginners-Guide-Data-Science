The egg tarts taste great!  But the confectioners' sugar is forgotten to be mentioned in the directions!  Anyway, juz mix the confectioners' sugar with the flour and salt to make the crust.  Like wat the previous reviewer said, the custard is 2 sweet, so need to reduce the sugar.  Other than these, this recipe is a great one for making egg tarts.

Would be a great recipe with a bit of tweaking.. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup for the custard, and it wasnt sweet enough for my family. Plus, the dough isn't flaky, like the types you find in egg tarts bought from an asian bakery. I am asian, and I wasn't terribly impressed by this recipe... the pastry was easy to work with, but you should roll the pastry thinner than 1/8'', so you get more egg custard and less pastry in the tart. I'd also advise you to not take out the egg tarts immediately once they are done baking, but to open the oven door, and leave them in for a little longer. This is to keep them from deflating too quickly and cracking in the middle. I'll be working on improving this, I'm sure it can be improved a lot after a few tries, thanks!

This recipe is good and easy to make but just to sweet, I kind of change the amount of sugar used as my family is on sugar watch...
Thanks for such a wonderful recipe...most of all it is Asian.

Did this a month ago out of curiosity. Used muffin pans instead, and yielded 20 tarts. I was too lazy to roll out the dough, so I did as one reviewer suggested and rolled them into balls then pressed them into the pans. The end result was wonderful, but was very bland. I have no idea why, the sugar probably didn't melt. The texture was wonderful, and the custard was so pretty. I gave my professor some and he loved it. My boyfriend did, too. I will try this again, and hopefully the next time will yield me sweeter tarts. :) thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was alright. I didn't feel like it had the same taste that you find in most dim sims resturants, which was what I was looking for. I also, didn't think it was very sweet like most reviewers said. I did think this recipe was easy and fairly quick. I didn't have tartlet cups so I used a muffin pan which worked. Also, I had to bake much longer then what was suggested.

When I made this recipe, I had twice as much dough as filling, so I ended up making two batches. The first night I took the time to roll out the dough and make the individual tarts, but it took forever! However it was easier to eat and tasted great. For the second batch, I was a little bit in a hurry, so I made the mistake of not beating the eggs all the way. MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN! The final product was yellow and white and tasted a little bit funny. Also for the second batch, I made one giant custard-pie instead of the individual tarts. This also tasted fine but you have to increase the baking time for a few minutes in order to cook the center, but be careful not to burn the crust. This recipe is just so perfect, and if you use a light butter for the crust, it is healthy too! Also, for both of the batches I did not have evaporated milk, so instead I melted 1 tablespoon of butter into 1/4 cup milk and it tasted fine.

Very sweet but tastes good.  I have only made custard part, without the pastry - by pouring the mixture into a pan.  After making this recipe a few times I've found that cutting down on the sugar doesn't change its wonderful taste.  For example, I use 1/2 cup of white sugar or so.

I loved it but I followed some of the recomendations and cut the sugar down by half and froze it for 30 seconds just cause I forgot bout letting it cool. Defintely needs more cooking time (round 10-15 minutes)

This recipe was yummy!! I didn't think the filling was too sweet at all. I substituted confectioners sugar with caster sugar for the dough and found it tasted nicer. Also we ended up with way too much filling so I'd either make twice as much dough or half as much filling next time. Yum!

Pretty good recipe.  Very easy to follow.  I recommend using a cookie cuter to get perfectly round tarts

I love the tart shell recipe. I use it for apple pie and my family loves it. Maybe I will attempt trying the egg filling next. Thanks

A good recipe for the tart crust egg tart.  I cut the sugar in 1/2 and used unsalted butter.  The custard took a long time to solidify, and the edges of my tarts got slightly burnt.  I would make this again until I find a good recipe for the flakey layered crust type of Chinese egg tart.  Thanks!

This is my first time making egg tarts.  I used this recipe and the egg tarts turned out great!  Te custard is so soft.  Although it was still a little bit on the sweet side for me even after decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup in the custard.  Next time I'll try to use 1/3 cup.  The recipe didn't specify if we should use unsalted or salted butter.  I used salted butter and added a big pinch of salt, the crust was probably a tiny bit saltier, but still tasted great.  So next time I probably won't add the extra pinch of salt and use the salted butter, since I do like the crust to be a little salty.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Good recipe.  I didn't have butter so I used shortening.  I didn't even have a rolling pin, so I just made circles using the palms of my hands - worked out fine.  I ended up with 22 of them, using muffin pans.

I halved the recipe which yielded 12 egg tarts. Mine browned quite fast maybe 375 would be better in my oven.  I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp as well. My family enjoyed them.

I actually haven't tried this yet, but given the comments others have made, I'm going to try to use the egg custard from this recipe and I'm going to try this for the shell:

1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup ice water
3 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface
1 cup (2 sticks) plus 5 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces

In a small bowl, mix together salt and water. Keep very cold until ready to use.
Place flour and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse briefly until mixture forms large crumbs. Add the salt water mixture and continue pulsing until a dough has just formed but is not smooth.
On a lightly floured work surface, evenly divide dough. Form each piece of dough into a disk about 1 inch thick. Wrap each disk with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

I baked my first egg tarts using this recipe and was able to make 8 small (muffin-size) tarts and one medium sized egg pie. The custard was perfect but I was left with a pastry dough that tasted a bit bland/dry. Some reviews from my friends were also of the pastry dough. Next time, I think I'll use 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and 1/4 tsp of vanilla for a richer taste. Then I'll see how it will taste like. But I won't touch the recipe for the custard because it's already perfect. Thanks for this good first time!

This was ok. It was impressive to make this at home, but the taste was nothing mind blowing. the crust was very hard, almost to a crisp. The custard was a little too firm, but I'm sure a little more evaporated milk would have done the trick. Will try this again with a few tweaks.
