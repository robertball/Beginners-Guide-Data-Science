Although I changed a some things around, I wanted to rate this recipe 5 stars because it was exactly the type of base recipe I was looking for. I used 1 cup honey in place of the corn syrup and 1 cup brown sugar instead of the white. I used spanish peanuts instead of regular (all I had on hand). I mixed all the ingredients in a large bowl and then transferred into the greased pan. Every thing was well coated. Turned out fabulous. Yum!

Tastes great.  I didn't think enough topping got onto the cereal, but left alone it sort of settled aroung everything.  Worked out very nicely.   I will use this recipe alot.

I have never had to rate a recipe with one star and I feel badly, but must be honest.  First, the syrup just does not meld with the cereal.  So I am assuming you just really have to mix these in order to have a uniform product.  Next, the bars themselves were nearly impossible to cut and even more impossible to eat without risking a trip to the dentist.  This was truly not a good experience.

My husband loves scotcharoo, which is extremely similar to this, so I thought this would be acceptable to try.  The family COMPLETELY LOVED it.   I replaced some of the corn syrup with the honey, after reading one reviewer's comments(about 1/3 c honey + 2/3 c syrup)  Considered doing the same with brn sugar, but hated to deviate too much the 1st time I made them.   Plus, not everyone loves nuts here, so I did leave out.  Wouldn't mind trying nuts in 1/2 the batch next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good! I used rice krispies instead of chex because I didnt have chex and agave nectar instead of corn syrup. I also used brown sugar instead of regular white. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough liquid since you dont use as much nectar as corn syrup but there was enough. However, they were a tad too sweet for me. Next time I would definitely lower the amount of sugar I use.

These were great! Just enough cereal to sauce ratio!
