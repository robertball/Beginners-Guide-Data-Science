I tried this recipe for my wedding reception. At first I was skeptical, I mean whiskey and OJ. However, I was pleasantly surprised!!! I did change the amount of whiskey from 1 1/2c. to taste, it was a BIG hit. This is definately one recipe that I will use again and again.

Wow, super delicious!  I do not like bourbon but was given a HUGE bottle so I was trying to find a way to disguise it.  Perfect!  Thanks!

This is surprisingly good.  I also made it with some maraschino cherry juice and the cherries added for garnish.

I wanted to make an easy cocktail for a get together, and this was perfect! I made half the recipe and served in a pitcher. Everyone enjoyed it - we didnâ€™t even open the bottle of wine!
