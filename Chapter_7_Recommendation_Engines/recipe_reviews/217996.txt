With a very minor change this was great! Following another reviewer's suggestion, I sauteed the squash with the onion, and it was fantastic. I was a little concerned about the condensed milk, so I drizzled it lightly off of a spoon onto the top of the cheese layers. I'm not sure that I used quite the amount called for, but it added just the right touch of sweetness for our family. Thanks for another great summer garden recipe!

This is one of my all time favorites!  I actually use more butter and sweetened condensed milk than the "official" version calls for, but it is a matter of taste!

It was good but in the future I will cook the onions ahead of time as they came out a bit on the crunchy side. I will also up the temp as at 350 for 30 mins, it didn't brown and there was a little too much liquid. I may also leave the skin on as it is a little monochromatic.

Good, but I think next time I would mix the onions throughout. An easy way to eat vegetables that aren't my favorites other ways!

It is a nice alternative to cheesy hashbrowns, but it lacked a wow factor.

Vegetables took forever to cook. I put it in for a lot longer than the recipe stated, and even tried to cook it longer after I had put it away in the fridge for the night. I wanted to like this, it was just too blah. Don't know what spices I would use, but it definitely needs something more. Probably won't make this again. Too much work for the taste.

My boyfriend made this exactly as written and found it rather bland.  I thought the onions overpowered the veggies and cheese.  If we make this again, we will cut the onions in rings instead.

This was just okay for me. I really didn't enjoy the sweetness of the condensed milk mixed in with my veggies and cheese.

Very good!! Added some mushrooms i had left over from meatball calzones last night and doubled it. Also used a dutch oven so it was a 1 pan kind-of meal! It was perfect!
