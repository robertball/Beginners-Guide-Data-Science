So delicious and amazingly quick and easy prepare. It took me MAYBE 5 minutes to measure and mix the ingredients together. I let the chicken marinaded in the sauce for a few hours until I was ready to bake it for dinner. It was so convenient to walk away and get some work done and not think about dinner, until eating it! My husband and I like to have extra sauce to go with a side of rice or quinoa. So, 2 chicken breasts and half the other ingredients was perfect for the two of us!

This recipe is great! I will be making this again. I halved the recipe and used chicken tenders (all I had) instead of breasts. I just reduced the cooking time to about 20 minutes. I served this with rice and broiled potato slices w/ ketchup which went well with the tomato sauce. Super simple recipe, I love it!

So moist and perfect mix of sweet and spicy! Sauce tasted great on the Jasmine rice I cooked to go with it.

This recipe is perfect for a quick dinner when you don't really feel like cooking. It tastes a little like sweet n' sour, but not quite - this was more aromatic & savory.  I have some garden veggies - zucchini, tomato, etc., and if I do this again I'll add them in to make the meal more complete. Also, I'd shorten the cook time to maybe 40 min, and/or take it out immediately, so it's less dry. Thanks for sharing!

These ingredients did not taste good together at all.  I followed the recipe as written.  The cook time for me was way off, I had to turn the oven back on and continue to cook for an hour more and I only used 3 skinless, boneless breasts.  No one wanted to finish eating it!!!  =(

DH loved this :)  My only addition was minced garlic.  Served over jasmine rice w/green beans and garlic bread.  I was surprised by how strong the chili flavor was.... was expecting a more savory and tangy tomato flavor.  Sauce was a bit watery.  Not terrible, but probably won't make again.

really good, very flavourful.  The only thing that I changed to suit my taste is I added garlic and extra chili powder for spice.  I will definately make over and over again.

I did not like this recipe at all. The sauce in my opinion tasted like some very cheap barbecue sauce and was very thin. I wil not make this recipe again.

I used boneless skinless thighs for this, and they turned out amazing. Big hit in my household. Also, I cut out the celery salt, as I didn't have any handy, and after they were cooked as per instructions, I removed the tin foil, sprinkled some extra brown sugar on top, drizzled them with some honey, sprinkled them with some extra chili powder and threw them under the broiler for a few minutes. Gave it a nice little coating of caramelized goodness. Served over long grain rice (I'd seasoned the water with a little bullion and chili powder to add some extra flavor). EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Five stars.

This recipe was easy enough, but my family felt the flavor lacked something.

Baked up moist but sauce was bland.  Precooking, sauce tasted like Open Pit but did not hold up through baking.  Won't make it again.

The first time I made this was because my daughter in law can't eat onions and our granddaughter won't eat mushrooms.  I love cooking with those ingredients.  But, I found this.  We all really enjoyed it and I've made it a number of times since.  We all laugh at the name.  The cooking time is off for me.  I cook it for about an hour.  My husband asks for this, so that alone makes it worth four stars.

Quick and easy desperation dinner--usually have all the ingredients on hand!  I used very thin breasts, and the cooking time seemed right.  I did set my oven to "slow cook-low" rather than turn the oven off.  I wish I had remembered to add garlic like some of the other comments mentioned.  I ended up with a lot of watery sauce, I think removing the foil would be a good idea.  I'll make it again.

I love this recipe. It's fast, it's easy, and it's tasty. My teen-aged son requests it frequently. I tend to stick to the recipes as written, though I may occasionally add garlic powder because, you know, garlic is always good. I don't turn off the oven, though. I just cook it until the chicken is done. Usually about 40 minutes, depending on the size of the breasts.

I am a newbie so to speak. I found this dish to be very easy to make and added cayenne pepper instead of chile powder for a good kick.

Quick, easy and delicious.    My cans of tomato soup expired in 2011. So, I substituted a jar of Marinara sauce  instead and it was really delicious.   In California we can only buy free range chicken now.  It is usually tough. Cooking it in this sauce made it come out quite tender. Will make this again and again. It's Snoogy chicken!

Loved it, I actually make extra sauce to serve over rice. Hubby is picky eater and he request this often. It is one of the throw it in pan and relax recipes.  Edit, the sauce can be thin so I take the foil off the top the last 20 min or so of cooking. I also cook longer than 30 min that is in the recipe. Usually around a hour if the breast are thick. If I am in a hurry I will cut them in half or strips to speed things up, also great over riced cauliflower.
