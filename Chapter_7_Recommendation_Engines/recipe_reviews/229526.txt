I wanted to cut back on the fat just a touch, I substituted 1/4 cup of homemade applesauce for half of the oil called for in this recipe. Before baking, I sprinkled a little sugar over each muffin mound. I got 12 regular sized muffins out of one recipe. These were baked at 350* and were done at 20 minutes. These muffins had the perfect amount of sweetness with a chewy texture and a good portion of blueberries. I thought these might turn out dry......no, sir. These are excellent. We all loved them.

Very solid recipe, but nothing "special". Just a good standard muffin.

I love this recipe. It's quick and easy and the muffins turned out great for me. I use this recipe as a base for most of my muffins, I just change the fruits and I sometimes sub applesauce for the oil and it works every time.

The only thing I added was a sprinkle of sugar on each before baking. Really delicious.
I made mini muffins which took 10-12 minutes. I would recommend using "larger" mini muffin tins or just using regular muffin tins because blueberries are so heavy.

Really good, I will definitely keep using this recipe. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is blandness, but as a base recipe it's excellent, only a tweak away from five stars. I added 1/4 cup oat bran and some vanilla (otherwise all as directed). Next time I'll do lemon extract instead. I found it made more than a dozen; had enough left over for half a pan of mini muffins.

A bit grainy due to the whole wheat flour.  I didn't see the cook's note about substituting butter for the oil, until it was too late - I wish I had used butter.  I filled the cups almost to the top and got 18 muffins.

Great texture and flavor, this is a wonderful recipe.  I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of sprinkling the tops of  the muffins with a little turbinado sugar after baking for a little sparkle.

A good recipe for those that like to use whole wheat as much as possible. I Especially like the texture - not fluffy like a cake but not too dense either. I added the zest of one lemon and squeezed 1/2 the lemon into the milk and vinegar mixture.

Yum! I like the "sour milk" concept (a substitution for buttermilk) and the fact that there's whole wheat flour. I used frozen berries, (rinsed under cold water and patted dry) and cut back to 1 1/2 c. which was plenty. Muffins are light and not "too" sweet. Believe I'll try cranberries and nuts the next time.

I only had 1 cup of blueberries so I added a cup of fresh cherries also.It made 14 muffins with high tops. They resemble a sweet, crunchy cornbread. The flavor is good.I think I will add some nutmeg or chinese 5 spice next time. It needs a flavor pop.

Perfect recipe!  I made it this morning and with my old style muffin pans, it made 2 dozen.  There are only 6 left now and only 3 of us (out of 5) like blueberry muffins.  This is a keeper recipe.

Just made these today and they turned out wonderful. Nice and Moist. I used grapeseed oil instead of canola and used fresh blueberries since they are in season.

These blueberry muffins I love, Im taking 3 dozen to a get together. Ive made these a few times & I like using 2 cups wild blueberries, instead of the regular blueberries that are too big. Other than that this recipe tastes just like store bought blueberry muffins, only better cause they're made at home.

I really like this recipe.  The muffins are a wonderful texture.  I did use apple cider vinegar instead of white, because that is what I had on hand, and 1 cup of fresh mulberries instead of blueberries.  I got 18 muffins, using standard cupcake pans, filling each cup about 2/3 full. I baked at 400 for 15 minutes.Next time I will probably add a little cinnamon, but I will definitely be making them again.

Great recipe! *Note: If you are using smaller wild blueberries, then use half the amount, i.e. 1 cup.

Took the suggestion of subbing half applesauce for oil. Also used fresh blueberries but accidentally only bought 6oz. They still turned out amazing!

So I tried this recipe and they didn't turn out very sweet. But that may have been because of the blueberries I used. Most of the sweetness comes from the blueberries so if they aren't sweet the muffins may be a little tart. But they were good. Crumbles in the top would make them complete.??I'll try that next time. But overall good.

Great option for an everyday muffin- and fool proof from the first attempt.  The  use of whole wheat flour gives it  an earthier flavor.  It should be very versatile for other fruit options.

Fantastic! I didn't change anything other than I did not have milk in the house, so I substituted it with coffee creamer. Turned out great! I will definately be making these again soon.

I also modified this recipe, and can happily say that they are the best muffins I've ever had/made (and I've made a myriad of different muffins). I did not have whole wheat flour, so I just used all-purpose flour. I also substituted canned dark sweet cherries in place of the blueberries.

Amazing and easy, even after my many substitutions! I only had so may ingredients handy, so I had to make may switches. I used 1 cup almond milk to replace the milk, 2 cups Branca de Neve superfine flour to replace the flours, 1/2 cup vegetable in place of canola oil, and only had 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries handy. I also had only a cupcake tin, which made 16 cupcake/muffins. Despite all of this craziness, the result was delicious. I had a muffin while it was still warm and it was unbelievably good. Definitely doing this again!

I love this recipe! Easy and good every time, follow the directions - do not over mix!
I used 1/2 C. sugar, and added some honey, because I love honey. Used 1/2 ww flour and added a little more of the white to make up for the imbalance of wet to dry ingredients. Also, used 1/2 blueberries and 1/2 chopped fresh peaches- good combo. Came out yummy!

These came out exactly how I hoped.  The only change I made was to add a bit of lemon Extract.  They were not too sweet but not bland either.  The half whole wheat made them a little more hearty, but they were not overly heavy or grainy.  And I love that the tops got nice and brown and crusty.  Everyone in the house gave these a bit thumbs up!

Fantastic! The only thing I changed is all purpose flour due to me not having the whole wheat on hand. These are moist, perfect texture and delicious. The only thing i was disappointed about was they didnt come out with high tops but I am fairly sure that is my error. Maybe I over mixed???  Make these as written and they make a fab muffin.

I didn't have wheat flour, so I used all white flour and added a small amount of lemon zest. They were great! Need more lemon zest next time.

This recipe is just ok for me. Dough was a little tough (I did not over mix). I am an experienced baker and cook, and as I was making these I had a feeling these would be just ok by the texture of the dough... Added vanilla and raspberries, thank god I did because these would be bland otherwise.

I just made these with the following modifications and they are so yummy, albeit a bit tart due to the Tablespoon of white vinegar and the reduced sugar.
I used unsweetened Almond mIlk, reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, added ground walnuts, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and reduced the canola oil to 1/4 cup and added vegan oleo to replace the other 1/4 cup of oil. Yummy!!!
