Pasta with Spinach & Chick Peas Haiku: "Gotta switch pasta. Can't decide, use fork or spoon? Taste was pretty good!" I followed the recipe, using spaghetti instead of linguine (close enough) but we were ultimately discouraged at not being able to both twirl the noodles and stab/scoop chick peas at the same time. If I make this again, I would use a smaller noodle, and let the tomatoes and chick peas simmer longer b/c our chick peas stayed more like pebbles than we'd have liked for the mere handful of minutes that it simmered in the instructions.

Yes to both. As the pasta was cooking, I sauteed some shrimp with the garlic for additional protein. And I used flavored (Garlic &onion, but any would be good) canned tomatoes instead of fresh.
Very good recipe.

I changed this a little by adding a bit of V8 juice (it's what I had on hand-it could have been extra tomatoes, tomato juice etc) plus some white wine for extra liquid and flavour. My 3 fresh tomatoes were a bit too small.  Towards the end I also added some of the pasta cooking water. I cooked this a bit longer than stated in the recipe. I also added the red chilli flakes early on, lots of black pepper, a few shakes of dried onion, Italian herbs, and Chef's Shake. I mashed up some of the chickpeas to make it more of a sauce, then I served it with toasted bread crumbs (be careful, they burn easily!) and shredded parmesan on top. I made farfalle pasta instead of linguine or spaghetti. Everyone loved it! Fast and easy & tasty. The extra spices and wine elevated this from a 3 to a 4.

Delicious  but would try a different type of pasta than linguine.  With the chick peas a shorter pasta would be easier to handle.

Used 10-12oz whole wheat penne. Added a 15oz can petite diced tomatoes in addition to a box of grape tomatoes (halved), instead of 3 whole tomatoes. 4 cloves garlic instead of 2. Added a tsp onion powder and a tsp Italian seasoning. Didnâ€™t chop the spinach as it wilts naturally. Served with toasty French bread. Good for date night ...filling, but not heavy.

Great flavor and easy to adjust to suite your palette.  I, too, chose to use smaller noodles for ease of wrangling everything in one bite.  You may also substitute any type of bean to slightly alter the flavor.  I halved the spinach and added chopped red cabbage as well for a little more texture and 'crunch.'  Will definitely be making this again!

I know it calls for a strand pasta but my handicapped stepson has difficulty with managing long strand pasta. I used rigatoni rigate and it was just fine. This dish was unexpectedly well-received by my family. It was a real hit!

This was quick and delicious! Hubby went back for seconds. :)  I only tweaked it a little.  I cut way back on the spinach, using only  4 cups chopped.  I used 1 can petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, I added some red wine after I added the tomatoes, chick peas, and spinach.  One reviewer said it was hard to keep twirled pasta and the goodies on a fork, so after the pasta cooked and before I added to the goodies, I used scissors to cut it into 2-3 inch pieces and it worked perfectly! I did add a little pasta water a splash of wine, and about 1 extra Tbs of olive oil to moisten it a bit.  This is definitely added to my recipe rotation!

Very, very nice.  A surprisingly tasty meal considering there are only three main ingredients:  tomato, chickpeas and spinach.  This is the first time I cooked with spinach and misjudged the amount I should use.  Remember:  spinach shrinks A LOT.  I had to chop and add more three times.  This dish has a very subtle taste.  I used Parmesan cheese which gave it a little kick.  Next time I think I will use double the ingredients.  Thank you for this recipe!

A very quick meatless dinner recipe.  I increased the garlic and it tasted phenomenol.   The best part is that it was so quick to make which is why I gave it 4 stars. Thanks for this quick and tasty recipe!
