My family makes something like this but we call them Spider cookies and only use the chocolate and butterscotch chips.  The person who said the mixture was gritty probably burned the chocolate mixture (I know from experience!)...try heating the mixture in the microwave at 50 percent and stir every 30 seconds! Good luck!

We had so much fun making this for our friends and neighbors for Easter. Thank you to the reviewer (Amanda B.) who reminded me to microwave the chips at 50%. Great tip!

I thought these were really good and really easy.  I made them in about 5 minutes.  I used 1 cup of marshmallows and still felt like there were a ton.  I might omit them next time and do extra nuts and chow mein noodles.

These are great. I had little pieces of homemade marshmallows, some chow main noodles left over. So I decided to try these. I followed the recipe, I just added 2\3 c. of coconut. I didn't have butterscoth chips, so I used 'Reeses' peanutbutter chips. Wounderful. I'm bringing these to work for an Easter treat. Thanks for a wounderful recipe.

These were so simple to make! (No baking!) Plus, I got rid of some leftover marshmallows and chow mien noodles (who knew this would be a tasty combination!) I made some with white chocolate and a nut-cranberry mix. It turned out well :) For chewier texture, through in the marshmallows with 15 secs left on the melting chocolate. It makes it gooey, but soft.

Easy to make but also messy (of course) but this meant that I got only half the amount of cookies that the recipe said it yielded. However, they were very popular at the office potluck. Like another reviewer said, I also noticed that they start to loosen up after they've been out for a while.

These had very good flavor, but after they had been out of the fridge for a little while they started to get very sticky and messy to eat. I was assuming the coating would stay hardened like almond bark. I will try making again but using almond bark instead of the chocolate chips.
