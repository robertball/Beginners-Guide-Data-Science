Yum!  Served this with fusili.  It is a fairly meaty sauce, with a good mix of veggies, and the sweetness is just right.  Quick too.  Two notes: 1) I used a can of diced tomatoes to replace the stewed tomatoes AND the fresh ones  2)I used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce.  Those substitutions are almost the same, though.

I used leftover sloppy joe meat that had veggies in it, so I skipped the steps for cooking the ground beef and veggies. I used tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes. Turned out pretty good.

I just used 3 tomatoes and ketchup instead of stewed and juiced tomatoes and white sugar and it worked like a charm

I have made this recipe several times now it is possibly my favorite pasta recipe of all times I absolutely love it and make it just the way it is called for except if I don't have tomatoes I put in a can of Rotel and skip the cayenne pepper
