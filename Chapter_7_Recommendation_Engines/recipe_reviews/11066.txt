I love this! I bought semi-sweet and white chocolate chips. I thirded the recipe and made four different dozens. The first was by the recipe. The second I used rice krispies instead of oatmeal. The third I use the white chocolate with the oatmeal. And the fourth I used the white chocolate, nixed the peanut butter and substituted vanilla extract with peppermint extract and topped 'em off with red sprinkles! All in all it was a fun night of NOT baking. :)

I made this recipe with my preschooler.  So easy for us to do together and very tasty.  I had mini marshmallows instead of large ones and used about 1 1/2 cups of the mini marshmallows.  I didn't have any coconut on hand, so I added an extra half cup of the rolled oats to bulk it out.  They turned out beautifully!

These are so incredibly good. Just what the doctor ordered for my chocoholics tooth! They didn't last long at my house. A pleasing variation of these would be to add raisins in place of the coconut. But this recipe is wonderfully rich and tasty as is! Thanks Lisa.

I picked this recipe because I didn't have any quick oats on hand and this called for rolled. I also only had stale marshmallows and coconut. But mixed in the recipe, you'd never know they weren't fresh. Everyone raved over these - they make a nice hardy cookie that's not as sweet as some other no-bakes. Will definitely make again.

Very yummy, easy to make, and the perfect treat to satisfy a chocolate craving.  I'm sold on no-bake cookies.  My husband won't keep his hands off them!  The only minor adjustment I suggest is that after you remove the melted chips, marshmallow and butter mixture from the heat, stir in the peanut butter and vanilla first until it is smooth, then stir in the coconut and oatmeal.  I used cookie sheets lined with waxed paper; actually I ran out of waxed paper for the second pan and substituted foil to cover half of it, and it worked just as well--the cookies came right off after they were set.  I doubled the recipe and used a tablespoon to form adequate-sized cookies for three hungry guys, and I came out with approximately 4 dozen.

This is THE BEST no bake cookie recipe out there!  I have been making it for a couple years now.  The marshmallows help bind it together and keep it soft, so they don't crumble like all the other versions.  Go make it!

These were completely different from the fudgy no bakes I'm used to. They were quite tastey though. I added coconut and extra peanut butter to it and they were wonderful. I wasn't sure if the ball of sticky mess (before I kneaded in the dry ingredients) was how it was supposed to look but it tasted good afterwards. I too rolled them into balls but they were a bit hard to bite into so I think I'll flatten them out next time.

I love these cookies!!  I roll them into little 'meatballs' and store them in the frig.  When I get a chocolate attack, 2 or 3 of these little yummies do the job!  My only complaint:  They deserve a better name than No Bake Cookies IV.....someone help!

Excellent!  The coconut is really a nice addition, and using chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder gives these cookies a much more chocolatey taste.

I have been making these for years but without peanut butter. They are a classic from my mom's childhood days and the old family cookbook. We  have always called them YUMMIES!!!  However the peanut butter was an excellent addition to one of our family staples!! Thanks so much Lisa

These were yummy, I was looking for something I could make with only a crockpot and we ended up eating them warm right out of the bowl.

These are great no bake cookies!!! I have always only made the ones with cocoa,etc.....but I had extra marshmallows and oats to get rid of so did the ingredient search and came up with this! This is much better than the other no bake cookie I normally make!! Will only make this one from now on!! Gee I'll even go buy the marshmallows if I have too! I did replace the chocolate chips with almond bark I had on hand and instead of the coconut I added 1/2 cup more oatmeal. This set up perfectly in the fridge after 20 minutes! Believe it or not the other no bake cookies I make are always hit and miss and sometimes don't set up :( So definately keeping this recipe instead!!!! YUM THANKS!

I made these about a year ago and they were amazing! Didn't save the recipe so I spent about an hour searing go it on allrecipes and finally had to goggle the ingredients to find it! (tried ingredient search too) the name is just so alike the others when the recipe is totally different! That's my only complaint. These are like mini fudge oat balls. Amazing!

Delicious and super eas.!  The only change I made was using about 1/3 cup butterscotch chips and the rest chocolate chips (didn't have enough!) and they turned out lovely.  Soft, but not mushy.  Love the addition of coconut!

These were a lot better than my other recipe that used cocoa. They were very moist and I loved the PB and coconut. 3 small children loved them! The prep work was simple and the result is delicious.

These are yummy. Used semisweet & white "striped" chocolate chips and everything else as states. Had everything on hand and figured I should use them up because they were on the way to stale or already staled. Could not tell the difference.

All my favorites in one cookie?  Impossible, but it is true.  I agree on needing a better name.  Very easy and can be done in the micro with setting on "defrost" to simulate the double-broiler.  I set my 1100 watt oven setting as though I was defrosting a 2 pound item and it turned out great.  Just stir about half-way through the melting process (9 minutes for my defrost setting).

these were ok, more like candy than a cookie.  The flavor was good, but as someone else said "something is missing"  I had to roll them into balls for them to stick together.  I'll keep searching

Great recipe! Soooooo easy and fast. I chilled them for 20 mins in the fridge and they were set. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars was i felt they were missing something.....i think next time i may throw in some chopped peanuts. Thanks for the recipe :)

Perfect texture!  I was amazed that I didn't find them too sweet.  Sooooo good.  Didn't have large marshmallows so I guessed and used approx 8 ounces small marshmallows instead.

I LOVE no bake cookies and not because they are easy to make, but because they taste so good!  This recipe is a lot different than the one I always made as a kid.  I love the marshmallows and coconut in the cookie.  What a great find!

My kids really enjoyed these- even my oldest who doesn't typically care for coconut.  I used the jarred marshmallow fluff because it's what I had.  If I were to make these again I think I'd cut back on the PB a little.

Excellent! This is the recipe from when I was a little girl and I couldn't find it.  I love that it does not have white sugar.  And anything with coconut is a plus. Delicious and chewy.  Thanks!!

These were just ok. Definitely needed more butter as the cookies were crumbly. The flavor was good, but I prefer the other no-bake cookie recipe on this site that calls for cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips. I wouldn't make these again.

I love this recipe. I made some alterations. I used coconut cream instead of butter for an all around coconut taste, and I added crushed corn flakes instead of oats, because our daughter does not like oats. Delicious!!! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These are terrific and hold their shape amazingly!  Omitted the coconut and added a few more marshmallows and some extra oats.

Awesome, just like my mom used to make.  Replaced coconut with an additional 1/2 cup of oats.  Put them in the freezer for half an hour or so, and they were perfect.  Fast and delish!

SO FREAKIN GOOD!! we dont have an oven yet (living overseas on a military instalation) and ive been dying for cookies. way better than i thought they'd be. i left out the marshmellow because we dont eat gelatin in our house (animal shortening) and added i cup golden raisons and 1tsp cinnamon. i also melted butter and chocolate chips in microwave (3mins) and added a little more butter as another comment suggested, in all 1&1/4 cups. so so good. i cant wait until my husband comes ome to taste them :). thank you so much!

These are great!  They are chewy and moist.  I must admit I am very lazy when the weather is hot.   I used the microwave to melt the ingredients rather than a double boiler.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I followed the advice of another reviewer.  I used 1 1/2 c. mini marshmallos and a 1/2 c. of oats to sub for the coconut.  These were great.  My husband ate them!  I was astonished, surprised and amazed that he ate them, liked them, and wanted MORE!  He said they were the best no-bake cookie ever.  That is high praise coming from a very non-sweets kind of guy! Thanks for sharing the recipe!  You made my hubby's day and my 3 year old loved helping make and eat them!

Delicious, these are my new breakfast, why sit for a bowl of less tasty oatmeal when you can grab these and go. I used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet.

Oh My Goooooodness.  I made these with 2 1/2 cups of Rice Krispies.  I didn't eat any the first day I made them.  I was baking different kinds of cookies and banana bread and wasn't really wanting to eat a lot of cookies. I refrigerated them and the next day I decided to have 1 which turned into a lot more!  (I won't say how many) These cookies are amazing.  Kinda reminds me of the Reese wafer sticks with coconut.  These are 6 stars.

I hate coconut but these are my husbands favorite cookies!!! With that said I made these exactly as the recipe said and they are fabulous!!! I used creamy peanut butter with honey and I melted the butter in the microwave first!!! I also used a regular pot to melt the chocolate!!! These turned out AMAZING!!!

Sooo delicious and rich tasting! I made a few changes...didn't use a double boiler, so I had to watch that the chocolate didn't burn. Adding raisins is really good, because they taste like Raisinettes with the chocolate. I also added a few tsps. of milk as I was mixing the oats in, because the mixture was too dry. Oh and I also sprinkled in cinnamon.

Somewhat like fudge- very yummy and rich.  Mine set up in 20 minutes in the freezer. I did it all over the stove top and it blended perfectly.

SO easy and my husband just devours them...I used crunchy peanut butter cuz that's what I had on hand and they turned out excellent.  Considering what ingredients go into these they're suprisingly not overly sweet, just very chocolatey and yummy with great texture. A definite keeper recipe!!!

I decided to make these cookies because I had all the ingredients on hand, boy was I ever dissapointed in them! They were very easy to make, however they didn't fair too well in the taste department. My husband, who loves everything I make and will eat anything, even said they were bland. I would give them away, but I'm too emarassed to tell anyone I made them. Save your no-bake energy for some rice krispie treats, which taste much better.

I've made other no-bake cookies before and these were pretty good. I can't say that they were my favorite but my roomates seemed to love them. Looks like I'll be making them again but maybe with a little more butter.
