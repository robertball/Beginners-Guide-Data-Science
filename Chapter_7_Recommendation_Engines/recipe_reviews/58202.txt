"Are you trying to torture us?" asked my husband when he saw what I was scooping up this recipie on top of a plate of rice (we have two fussy eaters ages 5 and 8 - and maybe a 43 year old too....). Well... he was the first one up for a second helping and that was before our two children voiced their approval of the meal as well. I added cornstarch more broth and a blend of sour cream/milk to make it more 'soupy' like a wet curry(I didn't have any cream on hand) and followed the advice for a fresh chopped onion instead of the onion powder. Such an excellent flavorful taste especially for such little work. Thank you for posting it.

Since the spinach sounded like it may end up tasting a little like creamed spinach I added an onion while cooking the chicken to make the flavor complete. I left most of the liquids in the pan (and I pre-cooked and drained the spinach) so I recommend reducing cream and/or broth by half or so. Good flavor... an interesting combo. Might be good over rice. Definitely not 4 servings. I suggest adjusting the recipe to use 1 breast per serving needed.

I tried the recipe as listed and it was bland. The next time I changed it a little - onion and bell pepper sauteed with the chicken make sure you brown the chicken well extra pepper flakes and extra garlic and shredded parmesan cheese on top. I served it over rice and my adult family loved it. The kids liked the chicken but picked the spinach out.

Excellent base recipe!  I took others' suggestions and added 2X the spices right off, along with garam masala.  I also used actual green onions instead of dried flakes since I had some to use up.  Chopped tomatoes stirred in at the end were nice for a color contrast and to help balance out the spiciness.  Served over rice.  Yum!

I liked this! The kids liked it too - the only issue is that it looks a little like a pile of spinach which made the kids not want to eat it - once they did they admitted that it was tasty! But - seriously - forget the onion powder - just chop a real onion and fry it off before adding the chicken/spices etc. Great recipe - simple and really tasty! Thanx.

I didn't use your recipe exact but was looking to use up some frozen spinach I had in my fridge and some cooked and separated chicken meat and couldnt figure anything out. your recipe was a great inspiration I cut up half an onion and 3 large garlic cloves and about a tbsp of fresh ginger and cooked them down in butter with red pepper flakes added the spinach and chicken along with salt and cooked for a bit then added some sourcream as someone else who had no cream recommended. I also used curry powder instead of the other spices then added a can of coconut milk and about a 1/4 of honey a squirt of lemon juice and lime juice it tastes amazing! thanks for your inspiration!!!

I lightened the recipe considerably by only using 1 Tbsp of butter and fat free half and half instead of cream. It was very good and didn't taste 'light' at all. I neglected to read reviews first and will add more spices next time.

I made a lot of changes but it turned out great. i went heavy on all the spices. i added potatoes onion and green pepper. Because of the potoes I used a whole can of coconut milk and 1 cup of the chicken broth. The flavor was weird so I put 1 tablespoon curry paste in 3 teaspoons brown sugar and 2 tablespoons tamarind juice. Turned out great. So definately i didnt make the original recipe but my version was great!

We really enjoyed this. I did add more spices and used fresh onion and ginger. I never use powder. Served over rice. My daughter's only complaint was that it had chicken in it. She is 16 and has decided she no longer likes chicken. I'll cook it on the side next time. Would probably be good over penne pasta as well.

Now I know I put curry powder in it for colour and taste but you cannot add salt to curry that is what I discovered so won't do that again anyway it was a great learning experience since I am from the Caribbean we make alot of curries and we never use spinach so this was very exciting for spinach is so good for you.

It was tasty enough. I doubled the spices and used an onion rather than the onion powder. Certainly a good way to use up spinach and chicken. But as my daughter stated "There's really no reason for the chicken in there. It would almost be better without it and eaten as a vegetable dish." I think she's right. Also we eat a lot of Indian food and are used to the spices so this seemed rather bland. It needs some oomph to make it special.

I think this was a great quick and easy meal. I used fresh spinach instead and made it more soupy/creamy by adding more heavy cream and some cornstarch. I also used less chicken that the recipe called for but it turned out great over some rice. My husband loved it.

I made this for the kiddos at our school subbing coconut milk for the heavy cream ( dairy allergies) and using fresh spinach which i ran through the food processor. They loved it!

A good solid recipe and easy to make. I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted frozen creamed spinach. It turned out well though I'm sure cream would've been better.

So yummy! I served it with a mixture of rice and quinoa. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. It will steam if you put it over the chicken after the broth is boiling. Followed others suggestions and used an onion sliced up instead of onion powder. Put it in with the chicken to get the full flavor. So easy and delicious!

I made some changes to this recipes.  Instead of onion powder, I used one whole onion.  I used a jalapeño pepper,  fresh ginger instead of crushed pepper flakes and ground ginger.  I didn't use chicken broth at all.  I would have used heavy cream, but didn't have any, instead I put in about a teaspoon or more of plain yogurt.  Additionally I used fresh baby spinach even though I am sure the frozen spinach will do.   I used  an immersion blender on the spinach once I cooked it down and took out the chicken when doing so, and added the chicken back once the spinach was blended.  Lastly just for some added fiber I added drained garbanzo beans from  a can and cooked it all in one.  It was good, tasty and nutritious.

I was doing an ingredient search using chicken spinach and heavy cream to find a recipe and this came up. Easily THE BEST recipe I've used on this site. I tweeked the recipe as another reviewer suggested using curry instead of cumin cordiander and ginger -- AND I added some honey lemon juice and coconut milk which really gave the whole dish an East Indian taste. It was FANTASTIC -- even my 13 year old didn't mind all of the spinach! Pour it over rice for a tasty dish.

Easy enough to prepare. A bit bland. I will take the others' advice to add onion next time and additional spices.

Super easy super delicious. All I did different was 8oz fresh spinach and 4oz fresh broccoli. The broccoli was a leftover. This is an amazing dish. Thanks!
