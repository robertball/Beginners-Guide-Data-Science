Very good dessert! I've never seen any blackberries here on the big island of Hawaii so I used Mango jam instead. The only other thing I did different was use unsalted Mac nuts as that is all I had on hand and just added about 1/2t of salt to the mixture. I baked mine for about 32 minutes and the inside looked like it could have gone a couple moor. I didn't get as many servings as stated but it was enough for 5 people this evening. Would I make them again? You bet! I will make it again just to try different flavors of jam!
