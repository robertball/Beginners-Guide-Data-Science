A perfect blend of flavors that will have you wanting to make more of this. After making this I recommend refrigerating the dip for at least one hour so the flavors can blend.

We absolutely loved this dip.  The only addition I made was adding a chopped Serrano Chile pepper.  My granddaughter and I ate almost the whole thing!  That's how good it is.

made this over the weekend and it turned out quite yummy. I used real chicken as opposed to canned chicken mainly because of the sodium content found in most canned foods. I used the SeaSalt & Black Pepper SnackFactory Pretzel Thins.

My family loved this dip. So simple, yet so delicious.  The seasonings were just right. I took the advice of BD Weld and refrigerated the dip to enhance the flavors. This dip disappeared quickly. Next time, I will double the recipe.

I guess I'm just too picky to use canned chicken. I think it tastes too much like the canned chicken (and I only used a 10 ounce can). I didn't really taste the avocado and spices. I do think I will make it again, but I will use some leftover chili-lime chicken from this site (if that ever happens!) and maybe up the avocado and spices some. I think this recipe has the potential to be good, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that fresh chicken is just better.  I would be willing to use some rotisserie chicken for ease.
