Its ok. I am looking for different ways to make fried green tomato's. I thought this looked neat but I liked the red tomato's in the sandwich a whole bunch and was disappointed with the green ones.  Sand-which is great with just red tomato's. Fried green tomato's better alone then in the sandwich.

This was my first time to ever try fried green tomatoes and they were good! Straight from our new garden. I used sourdough english muffins instead of bread.  Very tasty!

This is good. I actually don't use straight up cornmeal. I make a mixture of white cornmeal, raw grits, yellow cornmeal and flour. It seems to stay on the tomato better.  Sometimes I actually leave off the cheese and jalapeno and serve this on a rye bread. Its always awesome!

I've made this many times...if green tomatoes aren't in season, fried zucchini slices work great too!

I grew up on fried green tomato sandwiches.. we usually add a few slices of bacon..  AND YOU ACTUALLY CAN BUY THEM IN GROCERY STORES.. I THINK IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT PART OF THE U.S YOUR LOCATED

This is a great sandwich! I made this before because I was looking for a different way to use them and I'm so glad I found this recipe! I actually made it first time last year but I didn't put my review down,I did tonight. I make them on jalepeno bread,I use three green tomatoes but I use only one red tomato,because the red makes it really slippery but it's good!! Everybody enjoy this one!

Ohhhh man, this is heavenly! The only reason I didn't give it five stars? The store I stopped at didn't have any more green tomatoes :( So I had to use red, and of course, it is not even close to the same thing. (I've had FGT before, so I know the taste very well). I'm going to try a few other grocery stores and see if I can give this another go with green tomatoes next time. I gotta say, this is a great sandwich, I love the combination of the pepperjack cheese, the jalapeno slices, and the fried tomato! Thank you!

I have always wanted to try fried green tomatoes, and as a sandwich lover, this recipe fit the bill. I myself added Miracle Whip and a fresh basil leaf to the sandwich. It added another layer of flavor to the jalapeno peppers. I live in the northeast, and to find these coveted green tomatoes, I went to the local farm stand and found plenty. Enjoy!

FYI!!!!! No store will carry green tomatoes! You need to grow them!Or grow regular tomatoes and pick the not yet ripe. I grow them every year they are delicous!

It was great. I had brioche bread on hand and just regular American cheese, but it still turned out great. Nice to have another option to consume green tomatoes. Will be making again!

Made for husband and self on extra wide whole wheat bread. Thought the amount of cornmeal was excessive, cut back, but still had to throw a lot away. I used Havarti cheese because that’s what I had in the house. Substituted sliced onion for the pickled jalapeño, husband prefers. Only complaint was thickness of the sandwich —it was difficult to flip and required a knife and fork to eat. Tasty just the same, picked up the green tomatoes at a church fair.

Yum! I didn't have everything on hand so I use regular sandwich bread and substituted the jack cheese for Asiago and the jalepenos for fried onions and sriracha sauce. Served with minestrone soup on the side :) I will definitely have to try this again with the exact recipe.

Oh man, this was delicious!!!!  Definitely season up the sliced green tomatoes with salt and pepper before frying.  I think the pickled jalapeno over fresh was perfect in this.  There is a place for pickled jalapenos and a place for fresh jalapenos IMO.  Nailed it!!  5 stars :)

Absolutely wonderful! Had a hard time finding 'green tomatoes' but worth the search! Grilled cheese of any variety is a go-to!

I plan to try 'Fried Green Tomatoes' soon. Thank you.
