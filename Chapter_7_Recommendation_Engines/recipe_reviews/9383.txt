I made this dip for a Christmas Eve buffet and it went over very well.  I served it hot, as suggested.  However, I also tried the leftovers after they had been refrigerated, and I think I like the recipe better as a cold spread for crackers rather than as a hot dip!  Also, recipe should just say 3 oz. package of cream instead of 6 tablespoons, which is kind of confusing.

I used light cream cheese and light mayo for this recipe, and it was still delicious!  I also added 1 tablespoon of horseradish and 1 clove of minced garlic for a little more kick.  My husband gave it rave reviews!

Very good, but a bit bland for my taste. I jazzed it up with 1/4c finely grated parmesan reggiano, 1T horseradish and a bit more chopped onion. This is a great basic recipe.

Great recipe.  The original version turned out quite bland so I made a few changes.  I added garlic, black pepper and a bit more hot pepper sauce.  Great flavor and really disappeared!

My husband hogged this all..I did get to try it but it was only after I caught him in the garage eating it away from everyone else..Well he did have help a man who comes to our house never likes to eat the dips that anyone brings but let me tell ya he got busted with this one. The only thing is that I added more cream cheese and I made it in the microwave and it still came out great..Thanks

No Old Bay? I added old bay. Much more Maryland style if thats what youre looking for. Also added dry mustard. Did not like the minced onion. You have to have OldBay or J.O.s crab seasoning in crab dip. I think it is wrong to make it without it.

I've never had crab dip before, so I tried this last night.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor (and I LOVE crab)....I added the horseradish like other suggested...I just still wasn't too crazy about it.  The hubby like it though!

This is a great recipe! It's easy, fast and tastes great. I did add about 1/2 cup of mozarella cheese to make it a little creamier. I will definately make this one again and again.

Very good dip.  I opted to use shrimp instead and it tasted great as well.  Only thing I did differently was only use one can of artichokes since other reviewers mentioned an overwhelming artichoke taste.  When cooking, it looked extremely runny, but thickened up once it sat in the bread bowl.  Very nice presentation.

The version I ended up with was a bit bland, but not too bad.  I probably wouldn't make it again though.

I actually liked this recipe, but next time I make it I will alter a bit. Less mayo and more cream cheese, since I found it to be a bit to  mayonnaise-y! I also didn't add onion, since my boyfriend doesn't like, and I also skipped the lemon juice.

very good recipe!  I left out the lemon juice and added flaked parsley for decoration.  The dip worked great with a bread bowl!

Brought it to our church group home meeting and it was delicious!!!  I didn't have any hot sauce or cayenne so I used a sprinkle of creole seasoning.

I made this on Christmas Eve.  I took it out of the oven, left the room for three minutes, and came back to an empty dish!!!  Next time I'll double or even triple it...one suggestion is to add a tiny bit of sherry for a "Newburg" type flavor...yummy!

I made this recipe the first time and it was very bland, so I made it again and just like the other reviews I added my own twist on this recipe. I added to taste sour cream instead of mayo...not as heavy. I also added to taste; more lemon juice, more hot pepper sauce, more minced onion, a bit of horseradish, parmesan cheese and garlic powder. This recipe is a good start for a dip, but for it to be a know-out recipe adding the flavors you like will make it a recipe you will make over and over again. Also, you can add drained canned chicken or turkey, mashed, as an alternative to crab. And lastly our family preferred it cold rather than hot. Thanks for posting this recipe.

A hit with the family.  Did not have pepper sauce so diced a small hot pepper and it came out perfect.  Easy and delicious.  I did have to bake an extra 10 minutes to get hot and bubbly.

This dip went over great at a party I had this weekend. I never even tasted crab dip before, but for some reason I was tempted to make it. This was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

This didn't turn out so well. I thought it was too soupy and not enough of the crab taste I was hoping for.  It certainly wasn't inedible, just not so great that it's worth spending all that money on crab IMO.

This recipe was just what I was looking for to make a Crab and Jack Cheese topped pretzel!  I followed another reviewers tip and added a tablespoon of horseradish and a tsp. of minced garlic.  I then used the crab mixture to top a large Philly style soft pretzel and topped it with a shredded cheddar jack cheese mixture and baked for 20 minutes!  Serve with a sweet/spicy dipping mustard, oh my gosh...this is truly to die for!

Add fresh herbs about 1/4th cup diced Add diced avacodo or diced and drained canned artichole hearts garnish with crispy bacon bits This is a great dip to play with and whatever I do it is always a favorite with a crowd. Made it three times since August!!

Very good dip. I did make a couple of small changes though. I omitted the lemon juice since I didn't have any. I added about a teaspoon of lime pepper seasoning, instead, to add that citrus taste. Very nice. I also used Thai chili garlic pepper sauce instead of a vinegar-based hot sauce. Turned out really well. Next time, I'm going to try sprinkling some grated parmesean chesse on top.

Great recipe!  I took others advise and added garlic and horseradish.  We dipped carrots, ham, chips, bread, apples, and pears.  Thanks for the keeper!!!

Wasn't sure how well I would like the canned crab but it all turned out very well.  Nice subtle flavor and looked very pretty with the browned, bubbly top.  Will make again

I hate Old Bay seasoning so I was delighted to find a recipe that didn’t overpower the crab. I did add pepper, garlic and a tiny splash of Chardonnay. Maryland isn’t the only place for crab. I grew up in CA with Dungeness crabs and we do not add Old Bay to it. Thanks for the recipe.

I love crab but  this has a funny taste.  I think its because of the mayo.

Thoroughly unexciting...I should have added extra flavorings, but I was intent on keeping it as published.

Haven't tried making other recipes so not sure how to compare it or how many stars to actually give it, but this one was pretty good.

Yum! Used sour cream because my daughter  doesn't like mayo at all, she also doesn't like minced onions so I used a little fresh garlic.  Used Red Hot, hot sauce because I didn't see that the recipe called for Tabasco sauce, my family tends to prefer Red Hot so not real sure which would have been better.  It was great and I am sure the original recipe would have also been good as I like everything in it as well.  Old Bay is a must for us Marylanders!  A NEW CHRISTMAS TRADITION

Great Crab Dip!! I chopped up my own steamed crab legs which obviously paid off for freshness, but the recipe was superb. I wish I had snapped a photo, it was picture perfect.
