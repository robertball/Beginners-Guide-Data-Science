Very flavorful and satisfying! The recipe did not indicate when to add back in the chicken, so I did so for the last half hour. Since Whole30 doesn’t allow for rice, I think I’ll increase the amount of chicken and vegetables next time- not necessary, just a personal choice.

Wow!!!  So yummy!
Did the prep work one evening after work, cooked this dish the next night and promptly refrigerated.  
Warmed up a serving this evening ... what a warm and tasty recipe!

I have made other Whole 30 curry chicken recipes and this is by far the best. The vegetables make it more hearty and filling. For added flavor, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and curry powder before cooking. I also replaced the kale with shredded cabbage (added with potatoes and carrots) and omitted the plantains. Next time, I’ll add some peas for a little pop.
