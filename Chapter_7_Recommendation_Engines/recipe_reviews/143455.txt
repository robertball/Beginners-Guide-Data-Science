Since the recipe called for whipped cream, I interpreted that to mean the real thing, not Cool Whip. This was guaranteed to be good as it's hard to go wrong with fresh dairy and fruit (made even better by using homemade strawberry ice cream).  I used frozen strawberries so I found I had to add some milk to get it to blend. As you would expect, this was rich, creamy and very strawberry.

The BEST strawberry milkshake we've ever had. Take the time to make your own whipped cream for this recipe--it's really the only way to go. Excellent recipe.

Without a doubt the best milkshake I've ever had. I used my leftover "Five Minute Ice Cream" from this site and the result was amazing. Worth the extra crunches!

Oh. My. Gosh. A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!! I'm not even a fan of strawberry ice cream or shakes (I know, shocking!). It's been VERY hot here in the Windy City (the thermometer reached 92 degrees today - with full humidity). I needed something to cool me down. I purchased a pint of strawberries a couple of days ago with the intention of making this then. I was so stupid to wait lol!!! :) The addition of Cool-whip takes this over the top (IMHO). I also think using a good quality ice cream makes a HUGE difference. I chose Breyer's (on sale this week, even cheaper than the generic "store" brand...) and used extra creamy whipped topping (and a tad more of each than called for!). Since I was the only taking pleasure in drinking this (my fiance HATES fruit, especially strawberries!!!), I made one serving. Heed my advice: CHANGE NOTHING! You will be richly rewarded if you follow Austin's directions exactly. Thanks SOOO much for sharing your recipe here, Mr. Geraldson. This is better than my local diner's shake for sure! :-)

I did not care much for this. The whip cream gave it a weird flavor. I prefer the whip cream on top. Thanks anyway.

Ya know Austin, I've been very good about not dipping into the strawberry ice cream my hubby brought home this past weekend; that is until I ran across your recipe. I used chocolate flavored Cool Whip with this and it was incredible!!!! So because of you kiddo, I now have to walk an extra mile today; but it was worth it!! Can't wait to try your pork tenderloin recipe next! Thank you again!

This shake is the best shake I have made using strawberries.Even my dad said it was good.So far I made lots of strawberry drinks and he didn't say anything but this one he said it was good.I didn't expect it to turn out like this but it tastes really rich and creamy.Good recipe you made.
