Love this. Have made it 2xs. My tip for this recipe is that when it says small it really really means small. Bought a 20oz set of 2 breasts to make this for my husband and I and each breast needed about 2/3 a sheet of pastry to go around. I would prolly say that when it says small it either means a tender or about 1/2 one of the frozen breasts from the 2.5 pound bags The 1/3 of each sheet of pastry that went unused for the recipe got cut into strips and wrapped around asparagus that had been smeared with the left over cream cheese/mustard mix. Seemed to go really well. Throw it on the pan wrapped from raw right along with the chicken and it was plenty done for our liking.

I followed the directions as closely as possible the only thing I changed was the cooking times had to be extended by a few minutes. I think the recipe has potential but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.

Was very good. I added bacon. Try using brie instead cream cheese.

Very good! We didn't have mushrooms or the parsley but it still turned out well. Will make again.
