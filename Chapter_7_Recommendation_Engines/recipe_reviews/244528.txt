BRINE THE WEDGES!!! I you want crispy, not-spotty, and evenly cooked wedges...you need to brine them in salt water for 1 hour. The rest of the recipe is fine...but without brining the wedges before baking, youâ€™ll have no clue how they will turn out until they are done.

Flavor wise, decent.  Certainly beats a plain wedge.  But the instructions for making a marinade, fail.  It's all dry seasoning. Save yourself some trouble and toss the wedges in oil, put on the sheet and season by hand as you do the bread crumbs or panko.  That will result in the best evenly seasoned wedges.  Mine turned out spotty and where seasoning was heaviest, it burned. 

I will say, the wedges did turn out crisp for me and unlike so many others mentioned, I did not find them to be overly salty or seasoned at all.  All personal taste I suppose.

It was a good side dish. However next time I might use less bread crumbs as well as less salt. A bit overpowering but I would try and make this again!

Both my daughter and I liked the flavor of these, but the bread crumbs made them a bit too crumbly for us. Also, the process of making the marinade and rubbing it onto the potatoes is not something I would care to do again. I think I would take the advice of other reviewers and coat in oil and then just sprinkle the dry ingredients on, or toss in a bag to coat. And I think I would reduce the amount of bread crumbs slightly.

This recipe was fairly easy to make, it turned out really crispy as I like it.. my favorite so far. I did put the marinade in a bag then add the potatoes to ensure even distribution. Then I put them on the bake sheet. Perfect outcome

The flavor of these was very good but they did not get crisp at all. The bread crumbs did not stick very well.

Made it according to instructions how ever, next time I will leave out half the garlic. Personal preference. Other than that, very good side dish.

We love this dish! I put all ingredients in a ziplock bag and shake them up, makes for easy clean up! I also use regular size potatoes in place of red ones. Great recipe!

I will make this again, but will make sure to have long baking potatoes so the wedges actually stand up in the dish - will make the marinade and bread crumbs more consistent after baking/roasting.

I didn't have chill powder so I used Cayenne powder. It was a bit spicy but still yummy.

I guess I was just looking for something with a little more flavor.  There's not too much to differentiate this recipe from many other baked potato wedge recipes that I've tried, and that's not to say that we didn't like it because we did.  The recipe doesn't state whether or not the bread crumbs should be dried or fresh, so I used plain panko crumbs (maybe the Italian panko crumbs would have brought that flavor I was looking for?).  After baking, they definitely need a good sprinkle of salt.
