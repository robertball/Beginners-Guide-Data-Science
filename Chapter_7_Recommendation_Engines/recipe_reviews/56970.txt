I was extremely nervous about Cube Steak, since I heard it could be very tough if prepared wrong.  I was absolutely delighted with the outcome of this recipe!  I used 1 can roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and one can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup, added an onion and can of drained mushrooms and put it all in my crock pot for 10 hours.  It smelled great and when I went to take the meat out of the pot, it actually fell apart.  I served it over garlic mashed potatoes drizzled with the mushrooms and onions.  I agree that the gravy was very thin, but I don't like thick gravy, so it was fine.  I could have thickened it.  My husband and house guest loved it and even my 2 year olds ate it up.  So easy and inexpensive to make.  I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe makes a great gravy, the meat was very tender but I think next time I would not put the cujan seasoning and maybe at something like garlic instead.

I thought it was wonderful and my hubby gobbled it right up!  I did make a slight change by putting it in my crock pot instead of the oven and by using Cream of Celery Soup instead of mushroom!  Will definitely make this dish again soon!  Served over egg noodles by the way!

Love this recipe - however, i doctored on it some.  1st - used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can beefy mushroom, 1 can diet lemon-lime soda, and added about 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce.  Also, mixed a slurry (corn starch and cold water) and added to thicken it.  I also served it over grits!  IT was delicious! I prepared it all in a crock pot and cooked for about 2 hours!  I highly recommend!

Was a hit even with my picky eaters...I did the dish a little differently. Used garlic powder rather than pepper (my family is not spicey). I did not have two can's of cond. cream of mushroom, I used a "family" (large) size can, instead. I did mess up a little...I mixed the "lemon-lime soda" in with the "soup mixture" (left the mixture a little lumpy) but it turned out just as good!

Served with mashed potato's, used the gravy and opened a can of corn...It was WONDERFUL!!!

We get a lot of cube steak as part of our meat locker order. It's a challange to find a recipe that is good enough that we want to try it again. This is one of those recipes. We've even enjoyed it as leftovers.

Very good.  I left out the soft drink and put everything else in the crock pot for 4 hours on high. Very tender, tasty, and a hit with my husband.  Love the cajun spices- really gave it a kick.

Very tasty, and the meat was so tender.  Try carbonated beverages on other meats as well, it helps to tenderize them too...

Very tasty with some minor modifications, and mine turned out, yes, fork-tender when I prepared them the following way:  I lightly pounded the steaks on each side with a hammer tenderizer (spikey side), sprinkled both sides with pepper and liberally with Cajun seasoning and garlic powder (NEED to do this - this is the only real seasoning other than the onion soup unless you prefer things more on the bland side).  In a large non-stick skillet, I lightly browned each side of the steaks in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  I mixed together the can of Sprite (we did not detect any "sweet" after taste), 2 cans of mushroom soup, and envelope of dry onion soup mix, then I poured the sauce mixture over the cube steaks after browning; brought up to a boil, then turned down to simmer and covered the pan.  I let the steaks simmer for about 2 hours - fabulous!  Even our picky 5 year old who usually fusses about chewy beef liked them, and the sauce is delicious served over rice.  This stove top method seems to work well for us - quicker and better than the slow cooker.

It was pretty good. Although, the lemon/lime does leave a sweet taste so I think I will substitute it next time for club soda as suggested by other comment.

I read the reviews and used garlic salt instead of cajun pepper. It was a little too strong salty taste. If I could have cut down on the salt it would have been great!

Just finished eating, and all I can say is YUM!  I followed the recipe, except I used Coke instead of lemon-lime.  The cube steaks I used were ones I bought for another cube steak recipe on this sight, and the steaks came out tough.  I thought I would never use the rest of them.  As it was they were in my freezer for 6 months, till now.  I think now cube steak may be my favorite meal.  I also left it in the oven for about an hour and a half.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

excellant gravy... husband loved this, although i did change it a little.... i used club soda instead of lemon-lime, to the 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup i also added 1 can of mushroom with roasted garlic. i used a packet of golden onion soup mix, added some minced onion and minced garlic.... cooked for 1 hr and then an additional 30 min.... meat was pretty tender and overall it had a great flavor.... i added the extra can of soup because some had said that the gravy was a little thin so by adding the extra can it thickened the gravy and i had plenty of gravy..... will make this again... thanks....

This dish was so easy and it tastes amazing. I did make a couple changes after reading some other reviews. Instead of a lemon lime soda i used root beer. I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and because my family likes the beef flavor i add 1 jar of beef gravy. Turned out amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe.

i also cooked this in the crockpot and it came out very good. one piece of advice, never season meat and then pour liquid over it, it washes the seasonings off, do it just the opposite.

This was awesome! But, I changed it quite a bit. Based on history, cube steak needs a long time to cook. Because of that & on others' reviews I did it in my crock pot. Instead of 2 cans of crm mush (or crm whatever) I did one can of beef gravy & 1 crm mush. I did use the cajun seasoning, didnt really notice it tho, just good flavor all around. Added 1/2 packet of onion soup, only about 1 cup of sprite and a big splash of h20. Sliced some onions and stuck it all in the pot for about 4 hours. Could have gone longer actually, but its really, really good. (the rest is still cooking in it) Not too salty w/ my changes. I never recommend 2 cans of condensed soup, its very salty if you dont fully water/milk it down. Finally I added a corn starch/water combo after I took the meat out and let it thicken for a few. Delicious! Thanks for the great idea w/ ingredients I had on hand!!

This is a pretty good recipe. The first time I made it I did not add anything, but made it according to the original recipe. The second time around I added more flavor by adding Worcestershire sauce, garlic and onion powder, too. I liked that flavor better. Easy to make and will most definitely make many more times.

Absolutely delicious! 
I used a small diced onion in place of the onion soup mix (didn't have any).  I also added a drained jar of mushrooms.  Wonderful!!

Cube steak can be terrible if cooked wrong. I am not a fan of cube steak, but my hubby bought some.  I used this recipe and actually loved them.  I served this over garlic mashed potatoes and had green beans as a side.  WONDERFUL!

The sprite and the cajun spice did not mix as good as I thought it would.  The steak was not bad but I was expecting more.

I thought we had lemon lime soda, but we were out, so I left it out of the recipe.  It was still great!!  My hubby and 3 year old gobbled it up, we all really liked the kick the cajun seasoning added.  We will make again, but I will use the soda to help tenderize the meat-thanks!

Loved this! Made it for dinner at the firestation where I work, and it was a huge hit.  I am going to make it again, this time increase the bake time a little and see if I can get the steaks even more tender.

The taste of this recipe was very good but the gravy was so thin it was disappointing. I wish I had thoroughly read the reviews prior to making this dish so I would not have been anticipating a nice thick gravy. However, the taste was good and the steaks come out very tender.

Easy to modify with ingredients on hand... I used 1 can cr of mushroom and 1 can beefy mushroom, and only 1/2 can soda and had plenty of gravy.  Also no cajun seasoning because of preference.

This was very good and very easy.  I cut the meat into bit size pieces before cooking and it was nice and tender.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the Cajun seasoning, but our family didn't enjoy this recipe.  As some others have said, it was too salty(even when using low-sodium) and I also believe the lemon-lime beverage was not a good addition, because I've used the other ingredients together in other dishes, which are family favorites around here.  So, for us, I believe the lemon-lime beverage (we used Sprite) is what turned our taste buds off.  I'm glad others were able to enjoy this dish, though.  :)

Delicious!  I used 1 can beef consomme (sp?) instead of the cola and put sliced onion on top of beef before pouring the mixture over.  Kids ate it up!!  Served it over rice.

I thought this was an easy and tasty recipe. I was a bit skeptical using the soda, but it turned out great. The things I did differently were leaving out the cajun seasoning, dredging in some seasoned flour (pepper and seasoned meat tenderizer), shaking off the excess and browning in a hot cast iron pan w/ some olive oil. I also covered it with foil while it cooked because I was worried it would dry out.  The meat was tender and fell apart which may be due to covering it while it cooked to kind of help "steam" it a little.  I had 6 fairly large cube steaks and had to use an extra small baking dish to fit it all in, but I had plenty of soda and cream soup/dry soup mixture to cover it all.  The gravy was great with mashed potatoes and I plan on leftovers tomorrow with rice!  Next time I will add some sliced onions before it bakes. An easy and basic recipe for a cheap cut of meat. Thanks!

This was amazing!  I admit the soda threw me, but what  an awesome gravy this made!! My husband ate FOUR steaks!  I used adobe seasoning instead of cajun but it was a little too salty, will definitely use low sodium soups next time....otherwise delicious!! SOOO easy to prepare and I just threw it in the oven! A keeper for sure!

Excellent!  I used diet soda which worked just fine.  I only had one can of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken for the 2nd can.  I added 1/2 an onion and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  I did cook it for about an hour and a half because I was waiting for the husband to come home.   It was so good with mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.  (I used Round steak.)

My family loves this. Instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom, I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. Also to cut down on fat I always use 98% fat free soups. Very tender and the gravy is great over mashed potatoes.

My husband said it was better than his mamma's! I did take others advice and season and brown in skillet before putting in oven.  I used some white wine to deglaze pan and then used one can golden mushroom and one can cream mushroom soup with the dry soup mix.  I also cooked in oven @ 300 for 2 hours.  AMAZING!!

This was fantastic! The lemon-lime beverage did wonders in marinating the steak to just the right degree of tenderness, plus it added flavor. In addition to the Cajun seasoning, I seasoned the cubed steak with black pepper, fresh garlic, and a bit of seasoning salt. My husband is a picky eater, and he said this was the best cubed steak he'd ever had! My son devoured it, and even my 4-yr. old (also a picky eater like Dad, ate hers and said it was good). I will definitely prepare this again!

Excellent!!!  The cube steaks turned out very nice AND it was very quick to make.  Now, I did follow the recipe of another reviewer.  Season and brown the steaks in a skillet.  Then add all the other ingredients and simmer for 2 hours.   Definitely will make this again.

I tried this recipe even tho I did'nt have the exact ingredients. Even with my substitutions and eliminating the cajun seasoning since we don't care for it, these cubed steaks turned out great.I will use this recipe all the time when making cubed steaks. My substitutions were ginger ale with a bit of lemon juice.

I tweaked the recipe just a LITTLE bit. I seasoned the meat with garlic/onion powder and salt and pepper, and added a small can of mushrooms. I also just added about 1/2 can of lemon/lime soda. My family GOBBLED this up! Even my twin girls who NEVER like the same things loved it! They even asked for more of the gravy on the mashed potatoes!!! Great recipe!!

I rated this recipe a 4 because I modified it a bit. I doubled the seasoning for the cube steaks, and added about 2 tsp of garlic powder. I also added 1 can of mushrooms.  First, I mixed the mushroom soup, the onion soup mix, with 1 can of Sprite and 1 can of mushrooms in the slowcooker. Then I added the seasoned steaks. Next time I will cook it longer so the meat is tenderer. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch mixed with water. I served this on a bed of couscous (Tired of having rice, pasta or potatoes). It was delicious!!

This is a tasty recipe, though I will admit that I made some changes. I was afraid of the saltiness so instead of the onion soup mix, I used dried onion ans seasonings instead. I had no lemon-lime soda so I used a bottle of Mike's Hard lemonade left over from a party. It turned out wonderfully, though next time I will cook in my slow cooker, as suggested by som others.

Yummy!!  Even my kids (2 and 3) ate it!  I used steak seasoning instead of the cajun (I do not like spicy) and used real onions instead of the onion soup.  I baked for abou 90 min.  We used venison cube steak and venison steak.  Both were wonderful!  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  As my husband says "add to my list of favorites!"

This smelled wonderful cooking, but we were disappointed with the taste.  I think I'll try it again without the lemon lime soda.  It had just a hint of sweet taste that I didn't enjoy.

I tried this recipe thinking that baking it in the soda would make the meat more tender.  The meat was still tough and the sweet soda flavor was horrible!  I cooked it an extra 30-45 minutes hoping the sweet soda flavor would cook out, but it didn't.  I will NEVER try the recipe again.

My husband is a gravy FANATIC! He liked this so much, he finished off all the potatoes and gravy after asking for more steak! I will definitely make this again, even though it looks kind of "scary" going into the oven.

This is very good!  The gravy is delicious and the meat is surprisingly tender.  I left out the cajun seasoning as it was flavorful enough without it.  You can also use water instead of the cola.

This was OK on taste, maybe a bit sweet, but as far as the gravy it made, it was way too thin.  Also, the meat was so tough, it was hard to eat.  I will not make it again.

This was awful!  It was entirely too salty, even with low sodium canned soup AND soup mix.  There was also a very strange aftertaste.  The steak was tough, not tender.   I would have given it zero stars, if I could.

I never would use cube steaks because they never would get tender enough for me or my husband. I tried this recipe though and the steaks are nice & tender. I was a little concerned about the lemon-lime beverage but it tasted really good. I have made this 4 or 5 times now & I really like it. I have omitted the cajun seasoning though. It was ok with it but I like just salt & pepper better.

In a preverse thought pattern, when I first read this recipe, I thought, "God, this sounds so bad I have to try it."  And it was terrific!  The meat came out so tender and the gravy had a  slightly sweet taste (but not nearly as sweet as I was afraid it was going to be).  I cooked it for about 2+ hours though to thicken the sauce.  The second time I added a ton of thinly sliced vidalia onions - yum!  One note - be careful of the salt... both the canned soup and the soup mix are loaded, so whatever spice mixture you use, have it be salt free.

Excellent recipe and the gravy was great. I have to admit my partner gave me a weird look when I popped the can of Sprite. :-) Following other advice, I used only about 8 oz of Lemon-Lime. Gravy came out great. I also covered the whole time it was cooking. This is definitely a keeper recipe. Just added mashed potatoes and frozen green beans, and dinner was done.

This was a good choice for this cool, rainy evening. However, I did make some adjustments based on my cupboard contents. The lemon-lime soda sounded very appetizing, so I substituted cola, which I've used in other recipes. Added a splash of Worchestershire sauce and used C.O. chicken soup with a can of sliced mushrooms. Nummers! Great over mashed potatoes and a side of peas with some crusty French bread and butter.

This was a great recipe for our family.  I just doubled the amount of meat, (family of 6) elminated the cajon spice, added salt & pepper to flour, drenched the meat in flour and cooked for two hours covered in foil with slits in the foil.  I served it with rice and a large salad.  This is for sure a new regular!

WOW! Yummy and QUICK to make!! My family really enjoyed this and my husband said to make it a keeper! I didn't think it was too sweet at all as other raters have said previously. I was really skeptical about the sprite but it made it really yummy! I think I'll add more steaks to the recipe since you get a lot of gravy left over. I'm going to use the gravy over noodles tomarrow for the kids for lunch!

This was very good and very easy!  The meat wasn't amazingly tender but the flavor was fantastic. I didn't use the cajun spice only the pepper.  I bought the store brand of lemon-lime soda and it was wonderful. Be sure to only use 12 ounces.  I served this over mashed potatoes. Next time I'll try it with pork chops.

Well I'll say this Dish was a FAMILY HIT! While in the meat section of the grocery I noticed Angus Cube Steak on sale. Instantly I logged on to All Recipes app and typed in cube steak and this recipe came up! I changed it by using light cream of chicken because of the kids and adding chopped onions. It cooked on high in the crock pot for about 5 hours. I made some garlic red mashed potatoes and broccoli to go with it! Absolutely a HIT! The kids plates were so clean I thought our dog had got to their food! I will definitely be making this again! For the first time making cube steak this made me feel like Chef Emeril Lagasse(sp). THANK YOU!

What a novel way to cook cubed steaks to make them tender and juicy! Did these up last night anf followed the recipe to a T except I used Ginger Ale instead of Lemon Lime soda (sounded too sweet for me). Meat came out fully cooked and fork tender - no knife needed to cut it. Great flavor! Gravy it makes is also delicious. Served them with mashed potatoes and Mexican corn. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe and great cooking method!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Having never cooked any sort of meat with a carbonated beverage before I was unsure of what to expect and I can't say I cared for it to much - it was palatable, but that's about it for me.  Hubby and 15 yr old daughter liked it -, but it didn't pass the 8 yr old picky eater test.  The meat was sweet and the gravy was thin.  I won't make this again, it just wasn't my cup of tea, so to speak.

This turned out wonderfully but I did tweak the recipe a little. I used club soda instead of the lemon lime and sliced a Vidalia Onion over the meat before adding the club soda and Cream of mushroom soup mixture. The whole dish picked up the flavor of the onion and it was a big hit.

Maybe it is just me......but this was a disaster. The lemon lime flavored soda was not a good idea. It was sweet and disgusting...... 86 the soda.... just saying. I was all excited about this recipe too.

I gave this 4 stars even though it didn't turn out for me. I wanted to use a crockpot since other reviews stated this helped make it tender. However I guess my crockpot was too large cause it was way overcooked even on lowest setting. This was my first attempt with cube steak and I was so disappointed I doubt I will try again.

I thought the gravy this made was a very good gravy. I didn't have the cajun seasoning on hand, but had some beef shake and used it for seasoning the steaks. It didn't turn out tender as I thought, but might try it in the crockpot next time and see if that makes a difference. Still very good though. Thanks!

WOW!!! This was one of, if not THE yummiest dishes I have made from Allrecipes!!! I used Carribean seasoning instead of Cajun because I did not have any and only ONE can of cream of mushroom soup. The steaks were moist and delicious and the whole family gobbled them up!! Even my picky 10 year old and 1 year old devoured them!!! Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper in our house from now on!

This was ok.  The gravy was awesome, but the steaks were not tender.  I might try this again and cook for only 40 to 45 minutes.  Also, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken because that is what I had on hand.

We really did not like this recipe, but I think the problem was the cut of meat.  The gravy was good.  The flavor of the meat was notbad, but the meat itself was kind of tough and stringy, I guess.  It was the first time I cooked cube steaks.  I woul dconsider trying tis recipe again -- maybe witha different cut of beeef.

I liked it but my family just thought it was okay.  I would make it again if I had cube steak and did not know what to do with it.  It definitely gives us a very tender cube steak!  But reminds me more of a pot roast in the end.

My husband and I really liked this recipe but when I make this again I will only use the flakes of the onion soup mix because it was way to salty. I also didn't have any carbonated beverages in the house so I just added some milk because it was to thick without. Not sure what the difference would have made of the flavor but I will try. The meat was nice and tender I put it in the slow cooker about 7 hours.

I did not care for this at all.  Tasted too much like a plain old 'roast'.  I also did not like the texture of the meat.  I think I will stick with chicken frying my cube steaks - but thanks to the poster for sharing their recipe - I seem to be in the minority.

The sauce is good. I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used garlic salt & powder and a little bit of salt instead. The steaks turned out to be tender and juicy. And my kids and husband did not complain about the sauce at all. I gave it four stars and not 5 because I felt that I used some much ingredient just to make a few pieces of steak is kind of a waste.

This was a big hit with my kids, but not so much with my husband. That's the weird part, because he will eat ANYTHING. I personally cannot vouch for the taste because after mixing it up and putting it all together in the pan, it looked extremely unappetizing and I could not bring myself to eat it. It did smell good while cooking, though.  I followed a few reviewer's suggestions, and my steaks still ended up a bit tough. Overall, I'll probably make it again, but only in a pinch if I can't think of anything else to make.

Being on a low carb diet, I changed the recipe a little and used Sprite Zero and low fat cream of mushroom soup. The gravy was very tasty...meat a little tough (not terrible though, my husband liked it and he is very picky). Wonder if it is because of the variation.

I read all the existing reviews and followed some of their advice as well as tried some other things.  I made the sauce as is and seasoned the chops with garlic salt, pepper and onion powder.  It was fantastic and my 9 yr old ate 2 chops!  I tried it another time with a whole cut-up chicken and received rave reviews!  I also tried it over a pork roast in the crock pot, but I think the sauce cooked too long and it ruined the flavor a bit.  I have shared this sauce recipe with my friends and will keep it as a permanent replacement to bottled barbecue sauce!

OMG! Whats cooking tonight. My family loved this meal. After reading the reviews I cooked my dish in a slow cooker and only used one can of condense soup. A really great tasting meal and you would not know it was cook in lemon-lime drink unless you saw me as I prepared the meal. Will cook again. Also since I used a slow cooker high 6hours very tender.

The flavor of this was wonderful; however, the gravy was a little thin.  I think next time I will cut the 7-Up in half.

Even though I made some changes it still turned out good. I did not use the cajun seasoning and instead of soda I used water. I also pan fried my steak and mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and poured the mixture over the steak while they were cooking on the stove. Yummy i will do this again.

My husband and I love this recipe.  The steaks were kind of tuff but the gravy is great.  Id like to try this in a slow cooker for tender steaks. I also left out the cajun seasoning. I read the bad reviews that said it was too sweet or too salty, but it turned out to be a perfect balance for me.  Im excited to use this gravy on other meats.

The gravy for this was excellent, but the meat wasn't very tender. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used garlic instead of cajun seasoning. But Maybe I didn't put enough Sprite in there to completely tenderize the meat. All in all was a great meal! This recipe would be excellent with some pork chops, or maybe some ground beef patties.

This recipe was cool. I was intrigued by the lemon lime soda, I just happened to have cubed steak and 7-up in the fridge so...I thought it was good. My 3 kids liked it as well. I think sprite would have made too sweet, 7-up has more club soda flavor. It only had a very slight sweet flavor I added fresh mushrooms and onions as well. I will make this again.

My husband were rating this he would have given it a 5 star.  The dish had an odd taste to me because of the sweetness.  I may make it again for my husband but I wouldn't make it for any other reason.

This was sooooooo good!  Highly recommended for something easy & tender!!  The cube steak was very juicy and tender, not tough, like other recipes I have used.  My husband wasn't too sure about it, but he loved it!  And the kids did too.  I will definitely use this more often!  Thanks.

Much too salty for my taste. Would try again with no sodium boullion and maybe either chopped fresh onion or dried onion. Also low salt cream of mushroom soup.

I'm only giving this 2 starts because my 7 yr. old son could not get enough of this.  I couldn't even eat mine and therefore gave it to my son.  Way way too salty.  I think i wouldn't use the onion mix next time, but doubt there will be a next time.  Sorry but won't even make again even for my son.

This was good but not terrific.  If I'm in a pinch I would make it again but wouldn't seek it out to do over and over again.

This was my first time making cubed steak and I absolutely loved this recipe!  I used salt free cream of mushroom as advised by other reviewers and it turned out perfectly.  Even my boyfried (who likes almost nothing)loved it!

Very good.  But like other reviewers, ours was also too salty.  I will make some changes next time I make this.  Never would have thought Sprite would make a good add-in, but it was great.

I read the reviews before making this, and I changed a couple things...First, I took note that many had said this recipe was a bit salty, so I used 1 low sodium cream of mush and one regular... (important to note that the low sodium soup is ready to eat, so dont add water!) Then, I used only 1/2 packet of the onion soup mix.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  When I took it out of the oven, it was a bit watery; probably due to the mushrooms releasing their moisture, and the low sodium soup.  So, I removed the steaks, and thickened the gravy with a little butter and flour; just like mom would......served over brown rice and with fresh steamed broccoli/lemon....this was a family hit.  Thanks Karissak for this keeper!

Excellent recipie.  I used low sodium mushroom soup so it wasn't too salty and sierra mist for the soda.  I also used very little cajun seasoning and just let the onion soup mix work for the seasoning on its own.  It was great!

Not bad at all, even though the sauce was way too salty. I ended up cooking the steaks for about 90 mins as I was waiting for some potatoes to finish baking - I'm not sure if this made any difference but the steaks were exceptionally tender. I would make this again but would definitely play around with the ingredients - fresh sliced onion instead of onion soup mix; diced mushrooms etc etc.

I used Creole seasoning and cream of chicken soup, added half a sliced onion, and didn't exactly measure the spices. It turned out great, and we ate it over rice. I'll definitely make it again. Very easy to whip up.

I have never made cubed steak, but have had it elsewhere & thought it was good.  I wanted a receipe to get away from "chicken."  My family wasn't crazy about it, though.  Not sure why - I thought it was OK, but will not make again - sorry!

This was pretty good. After reading the reviews, I made suggested changes. Used 8oz of beer, 1 can of mushroom soup and added sliced onion. Cooked 45 mins. Next time will add the whole can of beer because the gravy was too thick. Great flavor though! Repeatable!!

Ijust wanted to add that my Husband ate this and wanted to eat more but decided not to over do it.  He said these were the best cubed steaks he's ever tasted.  I am not a great cook, so I depend alot on the reviews of others and of course the cooks who submit their recipes.  This one I have to say was a hit.  I followed the recipe but I made a couple of changes.  I'm not big on mushrooms, so I use cream of chicken instead and I didn't have any cajun spices on hand so I just used the seasonings I had.  This turned out great.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks so much Karissak for submitting this recipe.

After reading reviews that gravy was too sweet, I decided to use beer instead (plus, no lemon lime soda in houes).  Was very good.  Cooked uncovered -- 1 hr 40 min -- until gravy was at desired consistency (stirred @ 1 hr).  Served with mashed potatoes.  Will make again.

This was very good for a cold fall day.  I baked this in a 9 x 13 pan with one can of sprite, one can of cream of mushroom soup, and one env. onion soup mix.  I did cover with foil and it turned out very tender & lots of gravy.  Yummmmm

A quick easy way to cook cubed steak!I lined my dish with tin foil and also covered the dish with tin foil and cut small slits in the top, baked for one hour turned the oven off and let it stay in for approx 30 minutes more, the steak was very tender and the gravy was nice and thick will serve chunked up over egg noodles.

Delicious, and so very easy!  I changed a few things...used McCormack broiled steak seasoning salt instead of the cajun stuff, and I dredged the meat in flour also.  This made a lot of gravy, so the next time I will either cut back to just one can of soup, or make extra rice for leftovers.  Even our two-year-old loved the meat, and she's kind of picky!

This was great!  I was pretty skeptical about the lemon-lime soda, but the gravy was wonderful.  I combined the Cajun seasoning and pepper with a little flour and dredged the steaks in it.  I also covered the pan with foil that had a few small slits in it during the first hour of cooking (overall cooktime was about an hour and a half).  I served with mashed potatoes and sauteed carrots.  Thanks for the great recipe - it was voted a keeper!

My husband loved this recipe, and actually took the leftover steak and put it on a grinder roll with swiss cheese for lunch, eating it cold..... will definately make it again.  I rolled the steak in the flour first and used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom... thanks for sharing its a keeper.

We thought this recipe was really good! My meat turned out alot more tender than I expected. I used Cayenne Pepper instead of Cajun Seasoning and thought it gave it a nice kick. Yes, the *gravy* is thin but that's nothing a little cornstarch can't fix. :o)

Wow! I’ve never had cube steak so tender before! I used a generous sprinkling of garlic seasoning, salt, and pepper instead of creole, but followed the rest of the recipe. I would say next time I’ll use either a little less lemon-lime soda or a thickener as I used 8 cube steaks and it was still a little too thin. I put this on a bed of egg noodles. Wonderful!

My family liked this, but it was too spicy for us with the cajun seasoning.  I will make it again but will use Cavender's or Lawry's or some other non-spicy seasoning blend.  All I had in the house for a 12-ounce soda was Diet Mountain Dew, but it worked really well, actually.  I also used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one of golden mushroom soup.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours.

Maybe it was the onion soup mix, maybe it was the cajun spice, or a combination of both, but I detected a slight  aftertaste.  Too much gravy, threw half of it away. My family ate it up, but I likely won't make it again.

I made this for 2 people, using the ingredients I had on hand.  I sprayed a crockpot with canola oil, put a layer of sliced onions on the bottom, added the seasoned steaks, using salt, pepper, garlic powder, ginger ale' 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Cooked on high heat for 4 hrs. Meat was fork tender and tasty, used the soup over mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe.   The cube were very tender when they were done cooking.   The only things I changed were that I used water instead of oil,  used garlic powder, sea salt, pepper,  thyme as seasoning, no soda at all, and put a lid over  it to keep meat moist during cooking process . Lastly,  didn't make broth into gravy.  Kept it as a broth.

Excellent, I didn't have 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, used one jar of Heinz Home Style Gravy and 1 can of cream soup served over Egg noddles. Very good and well make again.

Flavor worked well but I’ added  green peppers and onions which helped. I’d recommend aluminum foil to Kennedy the heat in  because they weren’t tender. Another option is a slow cooker and corn starch to make the gravy thicker.

This as a very tender recipe for cube steaks.  I cooked mine on the stovetop for two hours, turning the steaks after one hour.  I served them with mashed potatoes and my family really liked them.  The only complaint was that they were a bit too salty.  I think I would cut back on the dry soup and cream of mushroom soup.  Probably by half.  I will be making this again.

I made it as suggested and I liked it;however I did have to cook it longer so that it was fork tender.  I also thought it was really high in salt so I would suggest using low sodium mushroom soup as long as it has so much salt from the dry onion soup mix.  I made garlic mashed potatoes to go with it and then roasted some carrots with olive oil.  I  served the carrots along a side of   fresh peas.  It was a colorful dinner and my husband loved it.  I did add one other thing to the beef.  I had a package of large mushroom caps the size of the cube steak and added them, just to see how they would work since we have a few vegetarians in the family.  I think this could become a vegetarian recipe by using mushrooms and forgetting the beef..

My family loves this. I didn't have cajun seasoning so i used soul seasoning. Following the recipe exactly, the steaks were slightly tough.  This time when I made it, I put everything together the day before and let the steaks sit in the soda and soup mix overnight in the fridge. Also, I lowered the temp and baked it 4 hrs at 200 degrees. it was SO tender and delicious!!!

This was very good and my steaks were nice and tender.  My deviations from the recipe:  I browned them in my cast iron skillet then deglazed the pan with a bit of wine, added the rest of ingredients and popped in the oven for an hour and a half.  For soda I used club soda and my soup was one cr. mushroom and one cr. celery.    I served over rice and everyone liked it.  It was a bit salty so I may substitute a real onion for onion soup mix and use low sodium soups.  Oh, I added in a can of mushrooms too because, why not?  My gravy was very thick and plentiful.

These were the best cube steaks I ever had!!  I didn't have Cajun seasoning on hand so I found a recipe for it on here (all recipes of course) and made it.  They were so tender and very flavorful!  I baked for 1 hour like it said uncovered but my husband was gonna be another hour before he was home from work so I covered it with aluminum foil and it cooked another hour.  There was lots of gravy or juice in pan so it was fine cooking that extra hour. We had it with boiled potato's and it was good with the gravy on them as well.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was good.  Did not add the Cajun seasoning - but did put seasoned salt on them.  Added onion instead of Lipton soup mix.  Made in slow cooker and was tender and had a nice gravy.

Hubby liked it. Used tenderized round steak rather than cube steak and left it in the oven 2 hours. We did not notice a sweet taste, using Diet Seven Up.

Absolutely loved it.  It was very simple to make and it cane out perfect. I made one change however. Instead of soda I used a can of beer (miller light to be exact) and let me tell you...MY FAMILY LOVED IT. It gave it a high end feel and taste that we all enjoyed.   My second change was I added 1/3 cup of flour to thicken the gravy.   I highly recommend trying the beer instead of soda.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I put it in the crockpot on low before going to work & it was perfect when I arrived home. We served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. The gravy was better than I expected and we will make this recipe again and again. It will make a perfect freezer meal to prepare ahead of time. Thank you!!

****I just wanted to add that we tried this recipe with chicken breast and a pouch of dried vegetable dip mix, and it was just as wonderful. I've shared this recipe with many people and it never fails. We've made it 5 times since discovering it.****

I tried this recipe exactly as written except added some fresh mushrooms. (mushroom lover house!)It was very easy and tasty. I used generic lemon/lime soda and I think mine came out slightly too sweet. May not happen with brand name. Next time I may just cut down on the amount of soda a little. I had a house full of people (kids and grown ups) and everyone loved it. Even got asked for the recipe by the parents for their normally finiky eaters.

Incredibly easy.  I used ginger ale because that was what I had on hand.  Didn't add quite a full can (3/4 maybe?).  Also didn't have Cajun seasoning so made up something using garlic powder, seasoned salt, paprika, ground pepper, and a little ginger, ground mustard, and red pepper.  I suspect you can use anything (the red pepper gave it a subtle kick and will use again).  Next time I'll add potatoes and onions to the pan.  Either way, this was quick, easy, and good!

Great recipe!  I used the low salt versions of the soups as suggested.  Also I cooked it for 2 and a half hours.  This cut of steak needs way more than an hour to be tender.

This is a great recipe to use for making really tender cubed steaks.  I added fresh white mushrooms.  The flavor was quite good (especially when you pour the sauce over mashed potatoes), but I had to give it 4 stars only because I personally prefer a rich brown gravy sauce over my cubed steaks.  Will definately make again as there were no complaints from the family.

This was superb!  I did change one thing.  I substituted the second can of cream o' mushroom soup with plain non-fat yoghurt.  I figured it would cut the satl and make it just a little healthier.  This is going to be our new favorite for cube steak!

Very easy to make and it had a kick with the cajun seasoning.  Delicious gravy over potatoes. It was a hit!!!
I used diet 7-up, and fat free cream of mushroom soup and it still turned out great.

Pretty good!  I omitted the Cajun seasoning and baked them at 350 degrees.  Interesting blend of ingredients.

The onion soup was a bit much.  Way to salty.  I didn't even finish one helping and the rest went to waste. Kids wouldn't eat it.

I followed the instructions exactly except that I did not have cajun seasoning and used season-all salt.  I also let it cook an extra 1/2 hour because cube steak can be so tuff.  It was so bad that we each took one bite and put it back on the platter.  It tasted more like liver than cube steak.  Thank goodness we had enough salad and fruit to take it's place!

I made a few changes, but it turned out very good. I left off the Cajun seasoning, used about 1/2 c. white cooking wine and about 1/2 soup can of water instead of soda. I baked it on 300 for 1 hour & 45 minutes. The rest I left the same. It turned out VERY tender and moist. The gravy is runny, but tasty. I think it will thicken up after it sits for a bit.

I have to say that this steak was tender, the only downfall was it took 2 hours for the steak to be done. If you cook it 1 hour it is very red, raw. And I like my steak med-well ...Other than that is was excellent !!!!

Not a bad recipe did some changing: reduced lemon/lime soda to about 3/4 of a soup can - mixed with the rest of the stuff.  Added 3 good dashes of worctershire sauce and 2 good squirts of ketchup.  Will make again.  Thanks.

I made this right by the recipe and it was delicious.  Everyone liked it and my husband even claimed it was "His"  venison recipe.  Next time I might add some green pepper slices.  I did use low fat mushroom soup, (as usual.)

The ingredients alone scared me, but I wanted a new recipe for cubes steaks because my husband loves them. However he hated Comforting Cubes steaks. He said for me to stick to my original recipe. Therefore this recipe was not for our family. Sorry

Didn't care for this recipe at all. Too many strage flavors going on (e.g. cajun seasoning with Sprite). I suppose for some, it would be a zingy twist, but for me, I ended up not eating all of it. Perhaps if I made it with less seasoning and no Sprite?

This recipe was great!  My 6 and 8 year olds asked for seconds and thirds.  I had to deny them the fourth helping so that Dad would have something to eat.  I used only 1 can of soft drink, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, prepared my own flour and seasoning mixture and then dredged the steaks with the mixture.  The steaks were very tender and had a great taste.  I did cook them for about 2 hours however.  Excellent recipe.  I will be making that again soon.

My family loves this!  However, you do need to add about 2 tsp of salt to offset the sweet soda.  Also, to make it not as thin, you could cut the soda to 8 ounces instead of 12.  It was very yummy though!!
