To freshen up these rolls the next day, put the rolls in a paper bag, sprinkle the bag with cold water, and put in a preheated oven at 350F for 5 minutes.  They'll taste as good as the first day. These rolls freeze well too. Defrost in the plastic bag and let the ice crystals get absorbed back into the rolls, then freshen as stated above.

Yummm..These just came out of the oven piping hot. I split one, and spread it with melted butter: I'm on cloud nine! They have a light, yet substantial texture. The flavor is delicate, with a hint of sweetness in the backround. The crust is crisp, but those who like theirs thick will have to follow some of the modifications for chewy, crusty crust in the other reviews.  
I used all-purpose flour, since I don't have bread flour on hand, and after reading reviews saying these rolls were bland,**I added 1 1/2 tsp of honey** to the sugar and yeast when proofing it. I found that I didn't need to add as much flour as was called for in the recipe, but that could be because I used all-purpose. I used 3 cups, and then as much as was needed to keep from sticking when I kneaded it. **I let it rise on the top of the preheating stove, away from the heat of the vents**, and it worked well. After I deflated it, I kneaded it in the bowl for a few minutes, then divided it into 8 rolls and covered them with the same oiled plastic wrap I used to cover the dough for the first rise. **I had preheated the stove to 375 degrees, instead of the suggested 400, because it gave me more control on the darkness of the bread**. I brushed them with melted butter, and they baked for 18 minutes until they were a lovely golden brown. I will definitely make this again, and will pass on the recipe. Thank you, Jo!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used my bread machine to do all the work. They turned out excellent & will be made often at our house!

This was my second attempt at making homemade bread, and it turned out very well.  I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer to do all the mixing and kneading, so all I had to do was roll it out.  I made half the recipe into a regular-sized french bread roll and the other half into the rounds.  Next time I'll separate it into four pieces and try to make smaller baguettes, because after it had risen, it was bigger than I wanted.  Warning:  this is a very sticky dough to work with, but apparently french bread usually is, so don't be alarmed like I was!  Thanks for sharing, Jo.

I tried this recipe, and now my family is hooked. These rolls work well in every situation. My family and I recently went on a beachside picnic and the children begged for these rolls to make sandwiches with. They are easy, delicious, and turn out perfect every time. My 14 y/o son now makes them as well!! Thanks for the fab recipe.
I just wanted to add  a helpful tip to those who prefer a crustier chewier roll, spray with cold water with a fine mist spray bottle a couple of times during baking time. Great recipe!!

GREAT RECIPE!  I gave this 4 stars instead of three, only because I thought there was a touch too much flour and I didn't use the last 1/2 cup - didn't need to.  The bread was clinging slightly to my mixing bowl, so any more would have dried them out.  I also didn't use bread flour as it makes the rolls a bit dense.  All purpose gave them a nice, fluffy lift.  On a personal note.  I find it infuriating that people give recipes one star because of "user" errors.. like the rolls stuck to a wet towel when rising.  Well... gee, no kidding?  Don't punish a great recipe because you make a basic bread making mistake!  My advice is follow the recipe as it is written and if you're an experienced enough baker, then make your own changes, but if they don't work out - don't complain!  And one more pet peeve while I'm at it.. yes, usually bread does dry out the next day.. especially home baked breads.  You give an otherwise perfect recipe 4 stars because your rolls weren't as fresh on the next day.  Oh... I'm on a rampage today!  LOL sorry!

A good, basic roll, but not exactly "to die for." I reduced the sugar by 1 T. and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.

These were really good! I shaped them into oval buns (like the bakery) and they were perfect for sandwiches. The only thing I changed about this recipe was the size of the rolls. Instead of making 16 which would have been too small for sandwich buns I made 8.

These are the best rolls.  The crust is kind of chewy, and the inside is very soft and light, just the way I like it.  Last time I made them, I made rolls with half of the dough, and froze the rest, then later used it for pizza crust.  It was the best pizza crust that I have ever made.

These rolls were good, but taste more like an English muffin than true French bread!!The cooking time listed is WAY too long, 10-12 minutes is more accurate, or the temp needs lowered.  I cooked mine for 15 minutes while in the other room feeding my babies, and they were already starting to burn on the bottoms. They were pretty tasty, and look nice, but the recipe definitely needs some adjustments.  Maybe making a loaf instead of rolls would help?

The dough will be VERY soft and sticky... just a warning.  I really freaked out while waiting for these to bake, thinking they might not be that great.  Don't worry... it's supposed to be that way, as I finally read in a few reviews AFTER I made them!  I also used my stand mixer and ended up using 3 1/2 cups of the flour with my mixing paddle, then I switched to the dough hook and set it on 2 for about 8-10 minutes.

These are FANTASTIC.  I thought they were very similar to french bread, and I know my bread.  I ended up only using half of the dough for rolls (we're a family of three,) and I froze the other half and used it for pizza a few days later.  It was my first pizza from scratch and it was AWESOME.  My second batch is proofing right now.  (to freeze, after proofing and punching down the first time, form leftovers into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap a few times and put in a freezer bag.  To thaw, just set on the counter... it thaws fast and will expand.)  

I've tried a few recipes but am still new to the bread making game... this one is a home run, in my humble opinion.

Excellent recipe, perfect with easy Slow Cooker French Dip.  
I made them slightly oval shaped -just prior to putting them in the oven I made a small slit in the tops, French-bread style, and gave them an egg-white/water wash. Gives the bun a nice shiny finish.  6 people ate all 16 buns in one sitting!

I use my Kitchenaide mixer for this recipe and make it into two loaves. A few key issues for me have lead to a great deal of success with this bread. 

The first half, mixing the water, yeast, sugar into 2 cups flour along with the salt and oil is very straight forward and gets things going nicely. I let the yeast/sugar/water ferment for 10 minutes in a warmed 100 digree oven prior to mixing with the flour. The second half takes a bit more patience but the reward is great. Slowly add 1/4 cup flour at a time till mixed. When you get to the last 1/4 cup check your dough in the mixer. If it's all wrapped around the mixing arm and the dough is fairly smooth stop adding flour. I then kneed with the machine for about 6 minutes on medium speed. Don't give it too much flour and you'll be happier with the outcome. I'm getting close to "my" version of perfect with this recipe and with my open French loaf pans. 

Thanks for a great recipe, I couldn't be more pleased.

Great French roll recipe. Typically, french breads can be a little more involved; this is a great result from an easy recipe. I use my stand mixer to knead. I used almost exactly 4 cups of flour. The dough is sticky before it rises. Just grease the bowl well and it will be less sticky when it's finished. I always coat my hands in oil or butter flavored shortening before shaping the rolls themselves. French doughs are supposed to be tacky, not sticky. IF YOUR RESULT WAS HEAVY PLEASE NOTE: If you use so much flour that it isnt' tacky, your end result will suffer.  I also agree that the temp/time combo is off, but every oven is different and you need to pay attention to your baking.****************    If you want more flavor you can try using the same recipe with preferment. This develops the natural flavor of the yeast. Try mixing up half of this recipe the day before and letting it ferment in the fridge over night. The day you plan to bake you make the other 1/2 of the batch.  Allow the prefermented batch come to room temperature on the counter before mixing it with the new 1/2 batch you make the day of baking. Continue as directed.***Also worth noting after looking through the recipe photos, you must fold French dough over on itself when shaping or it will be flat and shapeless....If this recipe really goes wrong , I hate to say it, but it's you. Bread is really easy to screw up and you do have to have some basic skills and do things right. Thanks for a great recipe!

Though my sweet husband announced these were "homemade" rolls, one of our guests still insisted she discover which bakery we visited! They looked and tasted that professional. I used egg white/water wash, sprinkled some rolls with poppy seeds or sesame seeds, and misted the oven with water several times during the first five minutes of baking. To the recipe I also added 2 tsp. of vital wheat gluten to increase the rise and chewiness. I also like this better with increasing the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. TIP: Do NOT FEAR THE BROWNING !! It is ESSENTIAL!!! BE SURE TO BROWN VERY WELL! I thought I overbrowned/burned a batch, but even that batch was still perfect--hard outside and soft inside. If you underbrown you will have the boring rolls from other reviews. Later note: I have made these several times. I plan to leave out the sugar from now on, as it spoils the authentic taste. ALSO, for a perfect chewy crust, I have been removing from oven, letting cool several minutes, then rebaking until very brown and HARD as rocks. Really! You may be shocked that the inside is still moist, while it has the professional chewy crust. Lastly, I have found this needs a firm, not soft dough, so add extra flour if necessary.

I love it!.. This was so easy and the texture is so great for sandwich rolls, just make them bigger for hamburgers or hoagies.  Thanks to all my AR Bread Baking Foodie Friends it was a success.  I will save this recipe and make again.  I am not sure if I will ever buy hamburger buns again.  UPDATE...add some garlic powder and shredded cheddar cheese, then brush with butter and sprinkle on garlic powder... very good....:)  I also like baking them at 375 rather than 400. UPDATE.... READ THE PART where it says, to add 1/2 cup at a time until pulls away... that means it wont take all 4 cups.. ALSO.. I used one envelope of yeast and it worked fine also.

This bread is WONDERFUL.  Really easy to make by hand, and tastes great.  I made it into a loaf, but want to try rolls at some point as well.

Great recipe - really chewy and moist.  Instead of rolls, I braid or make mine into a loaf and bake for 20 min. exactly.  Looks and tastes great and makes great bread for panini sandwiches the next day.  Will definitely use this recipe again. TIP - don't over-rise or your bread will collapse after it's taken out of the oven. Follow the rise times. I double the salt and sugar for more flavor. For a 9" X 5" loaf pan, bake for 25 min. at 375.  I also bake mine on a pizza stone sprinkled with corn meal (so it won't stick).  The stone gives the bread an incredibly crunchy skin.  I also make Herb rolls with this, adding a few tablespoons of dried or fresh dill and parsley.

Great recipe!  These rolls are delicious and would go with so many foods - I think I'll make sandwiches with the leftovers tomorrow.  I did wind up only cooking them for about 12 minutes, so definitely check them before the full cooking time.

This is my favorite roll recipe. I've found it's so versatile.  I use unrefined sugar & all 100% whole wheat bread flour.  My family loves this recipe & we have used it to make wonderful whole wheat hotdog  & hamburger buns as well.

OMGosh! The family went nuts over these rolls. Honestly, this is such an easy recipe and the results were delicious and turned out exactly as I had hoped. This is only the third "from scratch" homemade bread I have ever attempted to make and I can tell you, they are to "die for" as far as my family is concerned. The texture and flavor is wonderful. Crusty outside and light, fluffy but slightly "chewy" inside. Exactly what they asked me to learn to make. I have made them twice this week and they are asking me to make them again tomorrow for Sunday dinner. No problem! I would love to. Thanks for sharing and making my family very happy! :)

This was really good bread. But I never got the crisp crust though. It was defiantely chewy & very tasty like an italian bread almost. Substitued the water for beer the second time I made the recipe & made that into a loaf also. That was great.

These are the best rolls in the world. 10 stars! No dairy, no egg ingredients (yay!) I make several batches, bake 'em, then freeze 'em. When I need one, take it out of freezer & pop in microwave for 30 secs - tastes as fresh as from the oven. BTW, I've found these bake much better on a silicone mat that sits on top of a baking sheet.

I have made this recipe seven times now.  These rolls get better every time.  Not only do they taste good, they look beautiful.  I roll the individual rolls as demonstrated several times on line by chefs.  I am getting better at that too.  Be sure to let them rise well for both rises.  I set my oven to 200 and then turn it off and stick my bread or rolls in to rise.  If you roll these into 12 rolls, they will fit perfectly in an 8 x 13 baking dish.  They end up as beautiful pull apart rolls.  By making only a dozen, you get nice large rolls that are great for sandwiches.  I make them in my kitchenaid and let it do all the work of mixing and kneading.  Thanks so much for the recipe JoCatlin. I can't imagine a better dinner roll recipe

I have tried all the suggestions made by all the other reviewers as well as the original recipe as is and as is this bread is fantastic! The only thing I had to adjust was the amount of flour; I live in the south and on humid days I have to add a cup or two extra to get the right consistency. Also, by accident I found that if the rolls are left to rise an extra 30 min - 1 hour they will be more hollow inside and crusty on the outside. I bake mine on a pizza stone and dust the stone with whole wheat flour to keep the rolls from sticking; the whole wheat flour is gritty enough to keep the rolls from sticking but doesn't take away from the taste like cornmeal and doesn't leave a messy, floury coating all over the bottom like with white flour.

These are so good. I love to bake bread and these are so easy to make and so yummy. I took me a few minutes to make the dough with my kitchenaid mixer.I will use this recipe over and over. I think next time half with roesmary and galic?or cinnamon? I think this is the kind of dough you could use for anything that uses a yeast dough. It was a soft dough that is easy to work with.

I've made these countless times and they are SO incredibly easy and SO incredibly good!! Key to keeping them soft is to place them in a large ziplock bag while they are still warm,(not hot). They reheat well in the microwave, just until warm. A good lowfat roll recipe, thanks!! :)

Wow! I've made bread many, many times before, but had never gotten around to making dinner rolls. I thought I'd shake things up today and whip some up, and this recipe seemed easy enough. What great results! I don't keep bread flour on hand, so I just used all-purpose, and I used olive oil rather than vegetable. They were light and fluffy, with a nice, chewy crust, and so easy to make. They look like they came from a bakery too! So smooth and keep a nice shape!
I tried using whole wheat flour for a batch, but they were a bit dense and didn't rise as nicely or look as professional, so I'll probably find a different recipe for whole wheat. But for white this is definitely gold!
Update: I made another 100% whole wheat batch with this recipe, but I added an additional 1/4 cup warm water to the yeast/sugar mixture to proof, and sifted 2 1/2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten with the flour. They rose quite nicely and are no longer dense. Still, it's obvious this was a recipe made for white flour, but with the extra liquid to moisten it and wheat gluten give it the extra oomph I'd say it's a decent way to go.

Good recipe.  My favorite thing to do with this recipe is ham/cheese stromboli.  I divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a rectangular shape.  Then put ham and cheese down the center.  Next, I cut tabs down the sides and "braid" the tabs over the top of the loaf.  My family LOVES it this way.  And to make the preparation work easier for the bread dough, I use my bread machine on the dough setting.

I tried this recipe with just regular all purpose flour and it was very good. although the recipe calls for bread flour i had run out of it. The texture and flavor of this bread was absolutely delicious. Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe.

they did not taste as good as they look, I tried this recipe because the ingredients looked like a good combination, but i was wrong. They tasted BAD! They were better when dipped in soup, or when overly buttered, but still not very good.

This is a TERRIFIC basic recipe that you can make plain, or add to. PERFECT!!!
 I quadrupled the recipe! since I was taking the rolls to a big spaghetti dinner at our church. Since I'm old and arthritic, I can't knead dough. So I added as much flour as would fit in my mixer bowl to all the wet ingrediants (after following the regular steps in the recipe) and mixed in my kitchen aid with the dough hook for quite a while to work up the gluten. Then I poured the wet stuff into my biggest bowl, which  held all the remaining flour and just mixed it together. The texture was great. If you just make one recipe, it might all fit--making this even easier.
I kind of hate reading how "I changed" this or that... BUT...Here goes:  I did substitute 1/4 wholewheat flour for 1/4 of the white. I also added minced garlic  and chopped fresh rosemary to the dough--- to taste. And used all virgin olive oil, which I also greased the pan with and dribbled lightly over the tiop after baking. No butter needed~
One  man enthusiastically said it was the best bread he'd tasted in his enitre life-- WOW!
There were NO leftovers--- although I made at least 25 extra rolls.
THANKS!

I use the recipe in the bakery department at a major hospital in my town. I use this dough when making delicious cheese rolls or you can change it up and make variety cheese and green onion, or cheese and jalepeno rolls. The possibilities are numerous. Simply use your favorite cheddar and cube it up with or without onions or whatever and chop it into the dough. These sell like hotcakes in the hospital cafeteria. The dough has great flavor. Before I put them in the proof box, I brush them with a beaten egg white & water mixture. Makes my cheese rolls turn out beautiful in color.

I finally made these today and am so glad I did!  I used all-purpose flour and quick rising yeast, which worked out well.  I only made them with 3 cups of flour and then sprinkled more on the dough as I was kneading it (probably about 1/2 cup more).  I baked them for 12 minutes. They were delicious and SO easy!  These are going to be a staple for us.

First of all, if you don't have a KitchenAid mixer...go get one! I used mine based on the advice of another reviewer and it worked fantastic! These rolls are very easy and fool proof. I will say that I didn't realize they would raise as much as they did during baking. I wanted larger rolls as I was making potato soup to go with them so I shaped the dough into 6 rolls. They were huge:) I followed the advice of another review and sprayed twice with a fine mist of water during baking. This created the most wonderful chewy crust. A fantastic recipe and easy to make if you want a fool proof bread recipe. This is a keeper in my house now!

Mmmm.... these rolls are fresh out of the oven and they are unbelievable.  Look great, taste even better - nice and light on the inside.  I'm allergic to eggs so I skipped the egg wash and instead drizzled melted butter on the rolls while they were still warm.  I also sprayed the rolls twice with water in the first few minutes to give a perfect crust.  I would say to others - if you've been kneading the dough and it doesn't feel perfectly smooth, no big deal - I never achieve this effect and always have great bread results.

Thanks!!

This recipe turned out very good.  It was easy to knead with out adding alot of extra flour.  After shaping the dough into balls, you can freeze them.  Just thaw covered in the refrigerator, and then rise for 40 mins as usual.  I agree that it could use more salt or sugar or something.

Well I was expecting more of a French bread, which these were not.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, a little sweet, but good.  These would go great with soup, or as a beef bun as others have suggested.  I will cut the sugar next time & maybe cut a diagonal "slit" to see if they bake up a bit better (they aren't very pretty).  Thanks Jo!

I've had problems with french bread in the past (so many steps, so much time) but this was great! Instead of making it into loves, I made cloverleaf rolls by making three walnut sized peices of dough and putting them in a muffin tin cup. I was able to make 12 of these and also 10 more smaller round rolls. They were delish!

Very tasty & easy!  My husband even gave rave reviews, which is unusual for him :)  My only trouble was the damp towel sticking to the top of the rolls ... not quite sure what the trick is to that.  But, I'll definately make these again!  Edit /Update: I made these again & covered the rolls with plastic wrap sprayed with non-stick spray, this worked!  So they were not only tasty, but pretty :)

I am not sure what went wrong, but I am sad to say I wasn't even able to serve these. Things seemed to be going well with the first rise, but after I formed dough balls and allowed the rolls to rise again, things went south. I ended up with flat, hard  not even like rolls. My yeast was brand new, so it wasn't that. I followed the recipe to a tee. Sorry for a bad review, but I want others to know in case they have the same experience.

O.K.  There are so many reviews that you don't need my input, but I just have to comment on how wonderful these rolls are.  I love yeast rolls but seldom plan well to start early enough to have them ready in time for dinner.  These are absolutely awesome.  My husband ate two and wanted a third.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks!

These turned out horrible. I followed the instructions exactly, and they turned out to be cookie-like, rock hard frisbees. Also, after the 40 minutes of raising, they stuck to my damp towel. Not a good recipe.

These rolls turned out beautifully. They also froze well. I will definately use this recipe regularly. UPDATE: After having made these more than half a dozen times I decided to change them by making them egg rolls today. I had reduced the yield to make only 8 rolls. I beat one egg in a measuring cup and added enough water to make the total amount of water called for in the recipe (substituted an equal amount of egg in place of water). If I were making a full recipe I would use two eggs. I didn't add any food coloring as commercial egg breads and rolls do but the flavor was similar to good commercial egg breads and rolls. Nice and soft and moist and delicious. This recipe is really a valuable addition to any recipe box.

These are wonderful!  One of the only bread recipes I've made that was successful- which says a lot in itself.  I made them a little larger and sprinkled sesame seeds on top to make hamburger buns.  Will make again!

Great bread recipe!  I used to make rolls with milk and eggs but my family devoured these and said they were better than the other.  This is my new dinner roll recipe. They were so soft and fluffy inside! If you normally keep buttermilk in the house, like we do, you can gently rub the tops with a light coating of buttermilk just before putting them in the oven to make them bake up nice and brown on top.

I made this fabulous bread, honeslty it was my first baking experience and I'm quite happy with the results. What I did in addition to the original receipe, was covering the doughs with greased clear wrap for rising and Before baking, coated that with egg white and poppy seed. Also I sprayed on that during the baking about 3 times with water. It came out of the oven so beautiful. It is so delicious too (not salty and not sweet). My next plan is substitute water with milk and adding more sugar to the receips to see what happens.

I have to admit that I'm not a very experienced bread baker. However - putting a damp cloth over the formed rolls doesn't seem to be a very good idea since the dough gets stuck to it after rising! What a mess … :(
The second time I made this recipe I used a greased plastic wrap – much better ;)
I used the dough for rolls and for breads (baguette stile), both times the baked product turned out a bit flat even though the dough rised very well. I thought it was a bit heavy for French rolls/bread but my guests liked it well enough, even snacked on the leftover slices the next day, so I will keep on experimenting with this recipe.
Thanks for sharing it! :)

I was looking for a good recipe to make rolls for sandwiches. I took some other reviewers advice and made 8 oval shaped sandwich buns. The only thing I did differently was brush the tops with egg whites. I have to say that I am very pleased with the way these turned out! I ate one to make sure they were good and now I am going to have to make another batch as I am sure my family will want more! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

**since my original review, I have made these with whole wheat flour since my husband cannot have white bread and still get excellent results! I recommend this recipe to anyone.**

I have been making these rolls for years.  My family loves them.  Makes great pizza dough, too.  It's just the right amount for two 16" pizzas.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but it didn't seem like French bread, as the recipe said.  It turned out as a fairly sweet bread, if you don't like that, try experimenting with half the sugar.  I made the dough in my Cuisinart and it rose beautifully.  I shaped them into squares - Ciabatta-style and slit and eggwashed the tops to make them look pretty. :-)

I also sprinkled half of them with sesame seeds halfway through baking.  Also, the baking time is too long - be careful!  You may need to add more flour or water, depending on the humidity.  Enjoy!

One word: AWESOME!!! Okay, two words: MAKE THEM!!! It is amazing how so few ingredients can result in such wonderful rolls! This recipe is so easy as well. We just threw it in the bread machine, and ran to the store. When we returned home, they had been in the bread machine longer than they were supposed to. They still turned out absolutely wonderful!!! These rolls are the best!!! Do yourself a favor and make them ASAP!!! :)

omgosh....yummy... I have never made any type of yeast bread before so I followed the recipe exactly as written...these are deliicious.  I have always been nervous about making a yeast bread because everyone talks about the science and art form...they make it sound so difficult.  These are easy breezy and yummalicious.  Whether you follow the recipe exactly as written or take other reviewers advice - these are too die for!!!

Just made these to eat with 'Jennie's Heavenly Slow cooker chicken' from this site (also a great recipe) and apart from doubling the amount of salt per other reviews, I made the recipe as is when it comes to ingredients. Used King Authur Bread flour. I wasn't in the kneading mood so I let my breadmaker do all of the work. I proofed the yeast. Added the water/yeast/sugar mixture to the bread maker, added the oil and then the flour and salt and then I was set! Took probably less than  10 minutes of hands-on work for perfect fresh french rolls. DEVINE! Nice and crusty on the outside and EXTREMELY light and fluffy on the inside. Egg wash worked well to give the tops a nice golden brown color. I will update another day to say how well the other half of the dough froze.

This was a very easy recipe and the bread turned out great, although it really does lack flavor. I made the recipe as stated plus added over a tablespoon of honey but no flavor really came through, so I would suggest adding some spice, extra salt, or more honey to the recipe if you are expecting flavor. I got 8 larger or hamburger sized rolls. I sliced some of them in half with a bread knife and flipped them inside out and made grilled cheese which turned out excellent.

I played with this for fun just to see some twists. And my best one is to use the same ingredients using spring water (clean taste) and adding 1 more teaspoon of salt.   I followed others' advice and did a preferment using half of all the ingredients adding the flour last, mixing well with a spatula and then adding water a little at a time to get a pancake consistency. Sit on counter covered or in cold oven for 3 hours and then in fridge overnight.  Next day, bring it to room temp. and add it to the other half of the ingredients mixing very well so well blended. Add more flour a little at a time, mixing well for a couple minutes each to get tacky.   Can also add opt. flavor ingred here like egg yolks, roasted garlic, hard shredded cheese etc.   Then a rise, punch and another rise. Lastly use greased round aluminum pie plates, shape into large golf balls and put about an inch apart. Let rise until pushed together, do an egg wash, bake and enjoy

These were great, will definetly make these again, but I found they only made a small batch, I would double the recipe next time.  Sweet and delicious, also would make them in muffin tins or I find they're a little tough on the bottom, to crispy for my taste.

These rolls are to die for!!!!!!  They were AWESOME!  I'm not a baker and they turned out great.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions.  I used all purpose flour.  I didn't really use 4 cups of flour, just kept adding until it was not sticky anymore...probably 3 1/2 cups.  Also brushed tops with egg wash.  Since I ended up reading reviews AFTER I made the dough and reading that they needed more salt, I decided to sprinkle the top of the roll with a little kosher salt since I only use unsalted butter I thought it might need the extra salt.  I also dropped the temperature to 375.  They were incredible.  I made an 4 course gourmet meal last night and these were star!  I think next time I would make them a little smaller, possibly 20 instead of 16.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

My 12 year old son made these as a surprise tonight for dinner.  They were fabulous!  It was his first time making any kind of bread and he did it without any supervision or assistance.  What a nice surprise upon coming home!  Just like my grandmother's rolls!

I love this recipe.  I made it as written and it was OK, the second time I substituted warm beer for the water and it was fantastic.  I even froze the dough after I shaped it into rolls and just thawed it on the counter and baked it the next day after it had risen.  I will make this bread again and again.

The only reason I'm giving these 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are a bit bland alone. With butter or anything else they are a 5! I used my breadmaker to make the dough and used 2 cups of wheat/2 cups of white bread flour. Also, I made 8 instead of 16 so they would work as sandwich rolls. If you do this, don't forget to score the rolls before baking or you will have less-than-perfect results. These were delicious as sandwich rolls! I will definitely make these again.

I always enjoy making these rolls.  If you can't get a damp towel off your proofed rolls, try letting them rise under a sheet of plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and lightly draped over.  Letting them rise uncovered, if you don't have bugs to land on them, will let a skin form and produce a harder crust that browns earlier in the baking process.  Just be sure they're cooked inside by tapping the bottom and listening for a hollow sound.  Thanks for the recipe Jo.

Thanks Jo!  Excellent quick and easy bread recipe!  I did cut some sugar and added more salt and it was perfect.  Also gave the dough longer proofing time which made it more light and fluffy!

Perfect french rolls every time! That's what I get when I use this recipe. I shape mine like oval torpedoes for french dip sandwiches. This bread freezes nicely. To get uniformity,I weigh them on a food scale. Each roll gets 6 ounces of dough. I do an egg white wash, and Voila! beautiful rolls consistently. They're really good with the Slow cooker french dip sandwiches on this site. Thanks Jo!

This is one of my all time favorite bread recipes.  I use it to make two loaves instead of rolls.  My family loves it.

Good and easy!  They always turn out and are very good with 1/2 whole wheat flour.

These are great!!  I used my breadmaker on the dough setting and following the order of ingredients recommended by my machine and then finished and the recipe called for.  We used these as buns for sandwiches.  My kids LOVED them!!  Thanks for sharing!

I am not new to bread making but this is the easiest dough I've ever worked with, it almost rolls itself into balls.  I used the bread machine and the 1 tbsp. of yeast had it rising almost out of the machine by the time it was finished with the dough cycle.  I only used 3 1/2 cups of bread flour and divided it into 8 rolls.  The rolls are delicious!

Great recipe.  I have been using this recipe for about a year and my family loves it.  To change it up once in awhile from white buns I add 3 cups whole wheat bread flour and 1 cup white bread flour.

easy and turned out tasty. I think the key is kneading it well and I used the 8 min guideline.

I've made these several times now and they seem to be foolproof.  I knead the dough and let it rise twice before dividing it into rolls and spray the oven walls with cold water while the rolls cook to give them a crispy crust.  Very good, my boyfriend can't stop eating them.

Delicious!!!  We made these to use for french dip sandwiches and they were perfect for it!!  We cut them in half and put butter and garlic salt on one side and a slice of provolone on the other side and threw them under the broiler for a few minutes and then filled them with meat from a leftover chuck roast, dipping them in the juices from the roast.  Absolutely delicious!!  The only thing I'd do differently next time if using for sandwiches is make them a tad bigger (make 10-12 instead of 16).  You'd get fewer rolls, but they would be a better size for sandwiches.

I made these for Thanksgiving and received RAVE reviews!  I followed the recommendation of one review that said to add a little honey, which turned out great.  The second batch I used wheat flour, which wasn't quite as tasty as the first batch I made with white flour (they were still good, but not great).  I'll have to sift through the reviews and see if anyone has a solution for the wheat flour variety.  Overall, though, these were a hit and will definately be made again!

5 stars for texture and looks, 1 star for flavor! Very bland... needs A LOT more salt. I did a "test run" of these for thanksgiving and I'm glad i did! i would have been embarrassed to serve them to guests as is. I'm doing another test today, going to use salted butter in place of the oil and add more salt, about 1 tblsp total. I'll update my review then.

This is a great recipe.I was going to give it 4 stars, but if you are creative it is a 5 with all you can do with it. The bread has a wonderful texture,crust and firm "body". I like dipping oils for bread when entertaining and wanted to give it a more unique flavor to go with the awesome texture. The bread does not have a significant flavor on it's own so it adapts well to seasoning. I used garlic olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and added a tablespoon of garlic powder with parsley to the flour. From one batch I make 3 large round loaves. When it has cooled about 5-8 minutes I melt butter with a little more garlic powder and brush the loaves. Wonderful for sandwich's, has body enough for using with thick dips, herbed dipping oils and "the Best Marinara Sauce Yet" (and it truly is) from this site. It's fun to put out and watch guests and family tear it up and enjoy. You can shape it any way you want and when made into buns for burgers and sandwich's that garlic flavor enhances everything. *** one last note..when I bake breads like this, I always forget to mist the loaves. My trick is to place a metal pie plate on the rack below filled with water. Put it in while preheating the oven and leave it in while the bread bakes. Perfect every time.

Wonderful and easy rolls.  Big hit at Sunday Supper.  I do believe though that I will add a extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt the next time I make them or use real salt.  I try to keep our food low salt as much as possible and used substitute salt and followed the recipe exactly.  I will use real salt next time because I think the substitute salt made a difference.  Still wonderful though.  This is a keeper and so easy.  I will use it a lot. Thank you JOCATLIN.

Bakery style rolls straight out of the oven! AND they are perfect every time! I made these for college students and they couldn't believe these weren't from the bakery. Definitely make the recipe "as is" first before tweaking this to your taste. I think some of the other reviewers may have a specific taste they are trying to achieve. This recipe is truly top notch as it stands. I like a variety of textures and flavors, so I may adjust this on occasion. Spraying the oven with water is an excellent way to put a nice crust on. But this roll can stand by itself without extra fuss. This recipe may be one of my best all time finds on this site!

Pretty good. I made it slightly softer, so it turned out to be a 'book bread' all stuck together in a rectangular pan. :) 195 degrees C for 19 minutes was perfect for a medium brown top and delicious insides.

Pretty good rolls, a little too sweet for my taste - will probably only use 1 tbsp sugar next time.  Update: Kept same amount of sugar, used 1/2 cup milk and 1 cup water instead of 1 1/2 cp water. Bread turned out much better that time, more fluffy and tasty! Update: Tried olive oil instead of veg oil and it made it taste more like sourdough. Type of flour you use is very important! I noticed a difference with blue ribbon flour for bread.

Wow! I just made this recipe and couldn't keep any for the next day! A nice "crunchewy" crust and fluffy interior spelled the end of any leftover rolls for the next day. I added 1 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon salt. I also only used 3.5 cups flour. I put 2 cups of boiling water in an oven safe pan on the bottom of the oven, to help the crust get that wonderful texture. Gona have to make some more tomorrow!

I think these rolls are absolutely delicious!! This is my first time making bread, and I can tell you I was really apprehensive about making it, but they turned out wonderful! I used my bread machine (which I've had for several years - unused and still in the box), and followed the bread machine directions of putting in all the liquids before putting in the dry ingredients, and adding the yeast last. I followed the recipe to the 'T', however, I did brush rolls before and during baking with an egg wash. This gave them a really pretty golden color; the taste is magnificent!! Thanks for this recipe!!

Great, great, great!  I made these two days ago for my husband and me and they are already gone.  That's all we ate for dinner last night!   I followed the recipe exactly only I removed them from the oven after 15 minutes.  I am making a double batch today to freeze.

This recipe worked perfectly for me in my bread machine with the exact measurements listed.  I was a little concerned since when you do it by hand you can gauge the amounts but I just tossed it all in and they came out just right.  I used melted butter instead of the egg wash to add just a little richness and beautiful shine to the rolls.  We loved them!

These were pretty good...I turned them into sandwich rolls. I was hoping for something a little crispier on the outside, but chewy on the inside. These turned out quite soft all the way through for me. Also, since I did sandwich rolls, they cooked at 400 for only about 10-12 minutes and then were done.

*Revision from previous reveiw - I made these again and this time used regular flour because I had no bread flour - they were still FANTASTIC!!

Sooo yummy and soft! I always make the Amish Bread recipe from this site but I think I have found a new love! Simple to make too.
Definitely a keeper!

I have only tried making bread once before, so it took me 2 attempts to get these rolls to be the way I liked them. The first time, I added all 4 cups of bread flower and mixed it by hand. The dough was VERY sticky and it was hard to knead it and to make it into balls. I also found the rolls to be a little too dry in the end. The second time I tried this recipe, I only added about 3 1/2 cups of flower, as other reviewers had suggested and I used a mixer. I also put a plate with a bit of vegetable oil and constantly oiled my hands while making the balls.  This made a huge difference!  The whole process was much easier the second time around and the end result was much better!  With a little less flower, these rolls are just perfect!  I served them with soup to a bunch of friends and all they could talk about was the bread!  This is a keeper!

I make this recipe every Sunday for the hubby's lunches. I make sub buns and this works out great. He's not a big fan of sweet breads and this is perfect for him. Very easy to make too!

I tried to sub half of the white flour with King Arthur organic whole wheat white.  They weren't awful, they just weren't as good as I know they would have been if I had followed the recipe.

The title tells it all.  These rolls turned out fabulous! I experimented with different toppings.  I left them plain, coated with egg and coated with milk.  My favorite combination was coating with milk and then sprinkling rosemary and parmesian cheese on top.  Coating with milk before you bake gives a nice crispy crust.  I highly recommend them!

I love this recipe because it's so versatile.  Sometimes, I add herbs and form the dough into small baguettes.  Another favorite variation of mine is to separate the dough into 3 balls, roll them into tubes of about 18 inches and braid them.  With either variation, the bread needs to bake about 30 minutes.  The braid is so great because everyone thinks I spent a long time on it, when it's actually very simple.

Awesome recipe!  There isn't any left over in my house when I make rolls or loaves of bread out of this recipe.  I also have used this recipe to make cheese or jalapeño bread.  Both were great successes.  Thanks for sharing!

Love it! I keep the egg whites off though to keep them softer all around! I also do not ball them. I roll them out on a floured surface and cut 16 rectangles with a pizza cutter then fold the rectangles to make the rolls, they look neat and taste great!

This is a wonderful basic french bread recipe.  I've made this twice - the first time the rolls did not rise enough.  After some research, I made the following changes:  I sifted the flour into the measuring cup.  This makes the bread lighter and measures the flour more accurately.  I also learned that the optimum temperature for rising is 80-85 degrees.  Forget the damp towel and use the plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray - much easier and no sticking.  Instead of rolls I made two loafs and placed them on a greased dark coated jelly roll pan.  They came out perfectly golden brown after 16 minutes.  Oh, I totally forgot to put the oil in the dough the second time and this bread came out much better!  It kneaded into a silky dough and rose beautifully.  So you can eliminate or use less oil with no problem.  As for the reviewer who said this bread is too dense - of course French bread is dense!  If you want lighter bread, then you would want to make Italian bread.   And as for the reviews of blandness, I don't get that at all - bread is mild tasting by nature unless you add herbs.  I plan to make this bread in many different forms - breadsticks, buns, rolls, etc.  Thank you for the lovely recipe!

These rolls were gorgeous and they baked up so light and fluffy. The crust was tender and the middles of the rolls were flakey and light. They puffed up huge in the oven, so you could easily make them smaller and get more than 16 rolls out of this recipe.

These are excellent. They are chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mine were done in 14 minutes.

I am not experienced in baking with yeast, so I was pleasantly surprised when these rolls turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used plastic wrap sprayed with Pam for the 2nd rising.  My 6 year old loved them as well.

The absolute best french bread recipe that I have ever used!   For anyone who is a bread maker, this should be the last recipe you ever try.  To previous reviewer, you must have used bad yeast or too much flour. The bread flour makes all the difference!  I used my kitchenaid stand mixer, and it came out light and perfect.  I made 2 loaves out of the recipe instead of rolls, by rolling out with a rolling pin and then rolling into a loaf. I made cracklin bread from it too, with olive oil, chopped up pork cracklins & green onions before rolling into a loaf. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I cut the recipe in half and made it with my wonderful Kitchenaid. I don't know if it was because my portions were small but I had to add almost twice the water to get the dough to the right consistency. After rising it yielded 4 giant rolls (large hamburger bun size!) that baked BEAUTIFULLY!! I definately recommend brushing egg whites for presentation. Thankfully I checked on them after 9 minutes because they were done! Any longer and they would have burned. Perfect chewy golden crust and soft insides. Goes great with honey or alongside stew. However alone I thought the taste was just a little bland. (maybe it was adding all the water and not enough salt? I don't know). Tasty enough to make it again.

These ARE TO DIE FOR!! Delicious!! The only changes I made to the ingredients were to use half the salt and twice the sugar since I prefer a sweeter and less saltier dough, adjust each to your liking.  My KitchenAid worked great for this recipe, for both mixing and kneading (about 8 minutes on level 2).  For a more uniform shaped roll, roll dough to about l" thickness and then cut with biscuit cutters.  I used two size cutters and was able to get 6 large rolls and 10 small rolls.  You will need to reroll the scrapes of dough. I used two 9"x13" cake pans to prevent damp towels from weighing down rolls, and buttered rolls before and after baking.  I let the butter drip from my pastry brush before baking so as not to deflate the dough. My baking time was about l0 minutes.  If you have a pizza stone, you can bake rolls in pan, and then transfer to a hot pizza stone to brown and crisp bottoms. I turned the oven off at this point so as not to overbake the top of the rolls. Watch carefully.  These rolls were wonderful for hot dago sandwiches. I can't wait to use this dough for bread!!  I am happy to include it in my most favorite recipes collection. Thanks for sharing such a subperb recipe!!

Good recipe.  No need to alter but note: to solve flattening problems, my aunt gave me a great tip.  When I covered it with damp cloth, rolls had risen, cloth had dried, and they were stuck.  If you attempt to move the cloth, air will get out and rolls will flatten.  Aunt said to spray/wet cloth again until very moist, then slowly peel off cloth.  It worked!  Made and served them yesterday for Christmas Dinner and they got rave reviews from everybody.  Also a very easy recipe to make.  Good luck and enjoy!  And thanks to Aunt Cathey for her sage advice.

I thought this recipe was really over rated (and I was really excited to make them based on all the 5 star ratings!).  I followed the recipe exactly - and read all the reviews for tips on making this recipe come out perfect..  The dough flattened out on the baking sheet (although I tried to shaped them into rounds rolls).  When they cooled they became tough.  I won't make these again (but will continue to search for a great homemade roll recipe).

These are good. Next time though I will add more sugar, 4 T. instead of 2. I made the cloverleaf rolls, and it made 12 large rolls in my muffin pan. They rose up very nice, they are light and chewy inside, and crusty outside. It took 11 minutes in my oven.

These were okay but not "to die for" as stated in the title.  They got stale awfully fast even though I wrapped them as soon as they were cool.  Nothing special.

We loved these.  I doubled the recipe and used them for sandwiches the next day.  I thought they turned out better WITHOUT the egg wash, however--it seemed to stunt the rise of the rolls.  Beautiful, yummy rolls.

I was not at all impressed with these rolls. They were kinda rubbery on the outside and didn't form real well. Maybe I did something wrong. Though I do have to say the texture was good and the taste delicious it is just that I have a better recipie.

These rolls are absolutely delicious.  They are a snap to make, and they rise just beautifully. They are definately a keeper  --  I don't know of any other rolls that even come close to taste and texture.  Thank you.

Great recipe!  I wanted a well regarded French Bread recipe to practice with as I did not have a lot of bread making experience... yet.  Now I have made this several times in just the past couple of weeks and have tried a few changes as well based on what other reviewers have mentioned.  Trials were -  lessening the flour by 1/2 cup,  doing the rolls with & without an egg white wash, as well as allowing my KitchenAid mixer to do the kneading.  The changes were not needed, these rolls turn out great by following the recipe exactly, minus a Tbsp. or two of the flour when mixing, which is then included when kneading.   Kneading by hand yields the best dough.  The best crust I have achieved by preheating a loaf pan  in the bottom of the oven and putting  a bit of water in it after I slide the bread in and then closing the oven door quickly.  Also, spritz your dough with water before putting it in the oven, as well as a couple of times during the first 8 minutes of baking .   A simple recipe, baked with a little steam action has yielded a better bread than my local bakery's.  Also, I've made this in several shapes - big rolls, small rolls, BIG bread bowls,  one large classic loaf, two medium loaves, & four smaller loaves used for sausage and pepper sandwiches.  Either way, we love this bread with sesame seeds! Thank you for a great recipe that has taught me a lot about mixing, kneading, steaming and baking wonderful bread.

This was my first attempt at making homemade bread, so I don't have anything to compare the recipe to other than store bought bread.  I was pleased with the final result.  The baking bread sure did make the house smell good!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great! Before making this I read the reviews, and some of them stated that the rolls were bland. I tweaked the recipe a little, adding 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2. The dough will be really sticky and moist so I had to add more flour along the way. These are chewy and delicious. When I baked them, I placed the rolls on a piece of parchment without spraying it with cooking spray. Unfortunately, they stuck to the parchment and did not come out easily. I highly recommend spraying or buttering your pan before placing them on it. Overall, this is a great recipe and I'll definitely be making them again.

Absolutely excellent and very multi-purpose!!! I've been trying to figure out a way to be able to make just enough rolls for my husband and I, since we never eat the leftovers of a fully batch. I had an idea from frozen rolls my father-in-law had used, but I still wanted the from-scratch rolls I knew I could make. 

OH. MY. GOODNESS. These are exactly what I've been looking for! I decided to just risk it the first time and made a double batch, and it made about 30 rolls. I shaped all the dough, put two trays of a dozen each in the freezer and cooked the rest right away. We had the fresh ones with baked potatoes and turkey loaf, then the next day I thawed a few more to eat with soup and they came out perfectly (thawed for about an hour, I put them in the oven on warm and they rise nicely). 

As delicious as they are plain, the one that completely sold me was this morning when I decided to try a version of monkey bread in a muffin tin. I need to tweak the cooking time and portions per muffin, but it is SO YUMMY! and I'm ecstatic that I can make monkey bread in small amounts!!

Nice recipe.  It made a LOT of dough.  I followed the recipe exactly except I threw a few ice cubes into the oven to create steam at the beginning of baking. I read that technique in a French cookbook.

These are really good! I also made the dough in my bread machine. I ended up using half white bread flour and half wheat pastry flour (because I ran out of the bread flour), and I added a bit of dried herbs de provence for flavor. The one thing I'd like to point out is that the dough (at least as I made it, your mileage may vary) was very sticky, so I found it helpful to flour my hands before I formed the rolls. Great recipe!

don't know about being french, it was very good anyway: I had the bread machine do the work, then I got the dough out and divided in 8. I flattened the dough balls and twisted the dough, trying to form little baguettes. Some come out, some went together and the baguette shape was lost: I brushed with egg white and baked for 15 minutes. The result was small loeves of slightly baguette-like bread, very good indeed.

A yummy, easy to make roll. I'm giving it 3 stars because it did NOT taste like french bread to me.  Made these to go with French Dip sandwiches; they were good, but again, not the taste/texture I had anticipated.

Awesome and easy - however, 400F was way too hot IMO. The butter I used to grease the baking sheets started to smoke and if I had left the buns in the time recommended, we'd have 16 burnt hockey pucks instead of delicious fresh buns...

These were very good.  I had to add a little extra flour, but that is to be expected with bread.  I served these with honey to drizzle on them.  Makes for a good breakfast side dish...

I made these as written and they were great!  One warning though ... if you use the bread maker, watch out because my dough rose above the top of the bread maker after 1 hour of the 1 hour and 30 min. dough cycle.  They still turned out great and we ate some by themselves and some as bread bowls for soup.

I have been making these nonstop for weeks! They are so good. They fill two cookie sheets, so after 8 minutes of cooking, I switch them around in the oven, so that they cook more evenly. When they are done, I pour a spoonful of melted butter over each roll.

These are the "gahl dang" best To Die For rolls yet.  They're super easy to mix up.  I didn't use my mixer at all.  Just follow the recipe to a T, hand kneaded the dough for 8 minutes, and so on.  They turned out fantastic.  I was out of veggie oil so I subbed olive oil.  I also have a convection oven so I baked at 385 for 15 minutes. ~Perfection!  So far this is the best people pleasing white bun/roll dough I've found.  Super Easy!

Hmm, they were okay. Not the chewy crust I was wanting. The flavor was good, but the texture was lacking. I used standard french bread procedure, and sprayed the walls of the oven and rolls with water every few minutes for 10 minutes, then left them alone. It did help them to rise more, but the crust was still left lacking.

This was my first time making  bread from scratch and I had no bread machine so I was a little worried how this would turn out. I followed recipe to the "T" and I was so amazed that everything turned out great! The dough was so light, fluffly and soft to touch. I made little splits down the middle of dough and sprayed with water right before baking. I carefully watched to make sure it didn't overbake. The bread rose nicely and color was golden brown and I ended up making 8 small loaves for a slow cooker french dip. After baking the bread, the outside of the bread had a nice crusty crunch and it was soft and chewy on the inside. This place smells so heavenly right now! I am so pleased with myself! I made this with slow cooker french dip and this bread held the juice well which is what I wanted. Other breads can get soggy and fall apart, not this one!

I made 4 mini's.  Sprayed them well with water and added a pan of water to oven floor. Started with a poolish for more flavor once I decided on dinner and  got the notion to make bread.

They were excellent! I had to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour (because I didn't have any). The crust wasn't quite as chewy as I wanted, but maybe because I used the wrong flour. Definitely a keeper.

These were good--maybe not to die for, but good. They're a little sweeter than I like my bread to be, I think next time I'll add more salt.

These were amazing right out of the oven. But once stored overnight lost that great crispy outside. Still pretty good though.

I'm giving this a 5 star, although my husband didn't agree. He found these too heavy. It was my first time making home made dinner rolls and they turned out perfectly. I chose the recipe as my nephew is allergic to eggs, and hence did not do the egg-white/water wash. I used my kitchenaide mixer and it worked perfectly. I will definitely make these again over buying store bought.

I made this recipe exactly as called for and I agree with another reviewer that it has a distinctly english muffin texture, which I didn't really care for.  I did little rolls as well as bigger oval shapes for sandwiches.  Recipe is easy to follow, but if I make it again, I will definitely be tweaking a lot.

These are very good indeed!  Finally we got a break from the heat today, so I decided to make these to go with our dinner tonight. I had to try one as soon as they cooled off enough.   They are perfect and I can't wait to eat more of them with our shrimp & mushroom linguine with creamy herb sauce and a bottle of our Virginia wine from vacation!

I just took mine out of the oven about a half hour ago.. they are really yummy! Crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.. and reducing a tbs of the sugar didn't make a difference, either! :)

I have made this recipe 4 0r 5 times now. I cut the sugar to 1 TBL and use olive oil instead of veg. Once I even forgot to add oil and greased  the dough/bowl well and they came out perfect. I have also used this recipe to make freanch bread loaves and pizza dough... I also make the dough with a Kitchenaid with a dough hook.

My kids loved these! I followed the recipe's instructions and added some advice from others: doubled the salt, but I also put a little garlic salt and parsley on top before baking at 350 for 15 min. They came out perfect! Don't think it was "French"  bread, but it sure is delicious. Very light and tender inside with a thin, hard and chewy crust. This is a keeper!

LOVED THIS!!!   I used 2 TBSP Butter instead of oil.  I baked at 375 instead of 400, and didn't proof the yeast.  I also didn't use all the flour, only about 3 1/2 cups total.  I didn't knead by hands, but used dough hooks on my hand mixer, and kneaded for about 5 minutes.  Despite all those small changes, the bones of this recipe are wonderful.  My son ate an entire small loaf himself!  I made five small loaves for subs tonight, and now we're down to four.  I also added just a bit of cold water on top of the loaves, and a spinkle of salt to each loaf.  It provides a nice counter to the sweetness of the bread.  Thanks!!

Wonderful! Usually when I make French Bread, it turns out heavy. This was light and tastes great. Even my husband who doesn't normally like homemade bread said it was good. He gave it is ultimate praise - "it tastes like it came from the store!" I will definately make it again!

Really delicious.  I doubled the salt and they weren't salty in the least - def. would have been bland with less.  I had a problem with the instructions about covering the rising rolls with a damp cloth - my rolls stuck to the fabric and deflated when I removed the towel :(  I had to let them rise a 3rd time.  Lastly, I baked for 18 minutes at 375 and they were perfectly cooked.  Excellent warm out of the oven with salted butter... Mmmm

The rolls looked very nice and were soft & fluffy inside.  The flavor is bland though - like an unsalted cracker - and a yeasty taste is left afterwards.  That is typical in high altitudes without double-rising the dough - so I always do that extra step.  My bread NEVER has that yeasty aftertaste otherwise.    I think I'll try these again with less yeast and see what happens.  I'll also add more salt, as many others here have done.    I did bake them for the 20 minutes - maybe it takes longer at high altitudes - so that worked for me.  (I saw that these were finished in half that time for many others here.)

EDITING - Made these again today . . . used 2-1/4 tsp. yeast and 1-1/2 tsp. salt.  MUCH better!  Not nearly as much of that sour aftertaste - more of a fresh burst for awhile after eating.  I used my baking stones this time (used Airbake trays yesterday) and the rolls came out much crunchier - still fluffy inside.  We like these MUCH better!

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. I use the hook with my Kitchen Aide mixer to knead the dough. It works great; it saves time and my arms. :)In addition, I form them into 6 mini loafs, which works great for sandwiches/subs.

This was delicious! I tried refrigerating the dough after the initial rest/deflate/shaping process and let it refrigerate overnight. I pulled the dough out and 2 hours later it hadn't risen very much but we were starving so I baked anyway, knowing they'd be pretty flat. However, it ended up working well for what we used them for which was sandwich rolls (served with Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Garlic Mayo)! They were like focaccia bread in terms of thickness, they cut nicely to make 4 thin and wide sandwich rolls (I halved the recipe). The flavor was terrific, they had a wonderful chewy crust and were tender in the middle. I will ABSOLUTELY make this again, but won't refrigerate. I'll just start earlier in the day next time! I can't wait to fix these as dinner rolls too, and I know I will use them again as sandwich rolls. That homemade flavor can't be beat!

These live up to their name. I add an extra half tsp. salt.  I put the ingredients in the breadmaker, when it's risen I shape them into balls, let them rise a little more then bake them.  Everyone loves these.  The kids are always looking for more. I make them once or twice per week. Thank you so much for sharing.

So good! These were perfect.  I recommend allowing to rise in a cool oven with a pot of warm (not boiling) water in the bottom. Also, try these with a little fresh garlic and shallots rolled into the dough. I used 3 cloves and half a shallot. Chopped finely or in a food processor, and roll into the dough after the first rise. DELICIOUS! The third time I made these, I cut the rolls to be larger and used as sandwich rolls which totally blew away any roll you can buy in a store or bakery. Try this, you wont be dissappointed.

These were DELICIOUS! I followed the directions to a T and brushed the tops with some oil and they came out perfect. I will make this again and again and again. The boyfriend requested wheat bread so next time I might sub one cup of wheat flour and see how they turn out!

I thought these were very good. I made them to use as hamburger buns and they held up very well for that. I put a little dried thyme in the dough as well because it suited the particular meal I was serving them with, and they were tasty by themselves with a little butter :)

This is a great recipe for rolls.  I baked them on my baguette pans and put poppy seeds on half.  I followed the recipe exactly but adjusted temp. per the pan mfr.  The dough is very nice to work with in the stated quantities.  I used my KA mixer.  The texture is very rustic like french bread and I'm quite quite pleased with my effort.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were super easy, and so delicious. The egg white wash did not seem to make much of a difference and they were not uniform in size. WHo cares they were great I am going to make them larger next time for hamburger buns. A must try for novice or expert.

These are quick to prepare and bake, but not "to die for"... Still, a very good alternative to long-rising French bread recipes. Used half the sugar when proofing the yeast, turned out fine. Would make again.

These were even better in loaf form (doesn't effect taste or anything but it just looked more natural). Followed everything to the letter except used a loaf shape instead of a ball form.

These rolls are freakin good!!!!!  MMMMMMMM....they just melt in your mouth.  Finally a roll that's not dense.  Follow the recipe exactly and you'll get perfect rolls.  Also brush some melted butter on top to make these even more wonderful!

I made these for Christmas and we really enjoyed them. I used my bread machine to mix the dough. The rolls were very big. Next time, I will probably make more than 16.

WOW!  These were great.  My oven burned the bottom of them. I have a propane oven; so, I will move the rack up further, use parchment paper, and turn the temp down some in an effort to prevent this from happening again.  BUT, the taste was great, I did the egg wash and sprinkled a little coarse kosher salt on top to give them a saltier flavor.  YUMMY.  I will make these again, often.

Proofed the yeast and dumped everything into the bread machine, set it for dough, and let it do the work. I split the dough into 14 rolls and they turned out perfectly crusty. I highly recommend using a baking stone, as I used both a baking sheet and a stone, and the rolls on the stone turned out much better. Will be using these tomorrow night for french dip roast beef sandwiches; used them tonight for open-face poached egg sandwiches.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I have been teaching my 5 children how to bake bread & this recipe always delivers! I usually make 32 rolls instead of 16 so each child can make about 5 rolls each (and I do the rest). They just love to see (and taste) the results of their own work.

I made these last night, but instead of making rolls out of them, I made about 4 bread bowls for my soup. They weren't as sturdy as other bread bowls, but my goodness they were delicious. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but all I had was all purpose flour, and it worked just great. They rose just fine and tasted divine.

Made these last night - Awesome!!!  Only added a bit more salt based on previous comments and put them in my muffin tins.  Great rolls especially when the bread machine does most of the work.  Weekly baking on my menu now!

I made the dough in the bread machine, and it came out really sticky.  I think this is just a problem with my machine, but it's worth noting in case it's not.

Either way.  The rolls cooked really well and tasted great with some honey butter.

Amazing!!! This was my first attempt at making any kind of rolls, and they came out perfect! I followed the instructions almost exactly, except using olive oil and using a bit more salt. Someone said in their review these rolls taste buttery even without butter on them, and it's true!! They are fluffy but not too fluffy, and cispy on the outside. I'm eating the fresh, hot rolls as we speak. =) Thank you for posting this, I'll be making this all the time now!

I messed these up.  I read an artical posted in the artical section of substitutes to use instead of the egg wash.  The recommended basting them with either butter or milk.  I chose milk and they deflated before I got them in the oven.  They were still tasty.

Good recipe but, for my taste, it seemed to be lacking in the salt department.  Next time I make it, I'm going to make a sponge to give it more of a crusty outside and soft, tangy inside and add another teaspoon of salt.  In the original recipes, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Really easy recipe though...thank!

OMG!! These are insanely good.  Exactly like rolls from a restaurant. I baked them at 375 since the other reviewers complained of burned bottoms. Also, I didn't have bread flour, so I used all-purpose and added some gluten. The recipe made a dozen, big, fluffy, chewy, perfect rolls. Thank you!

These Rolls were awesome, I just made them. I used all-purpose flour, because I didn't have Bread flour, I halved the recipe and put just a little bit more than half the amout of yeast. I added a little bit (about a teaspoon) of honey to the mixture (from a local honey maker) I let proof for the described times, I brushed some with egg white, and left the others alone, They all came out terriffic, I enjoyed them with some butter, baking time for me was about 16-17 minutes, perfect with some honey Barbecue chicken wings, which was the case for me, I made one big roll for a sandwhich tomorrow and can't wait to bite into it. Great Recipe, easy to make for a beginner, came out better than I expected for my 3rd time making breads.

I am an experienced challah baker.  this was my first french bread.  The rolls seemed to rise too much - they more than doubled within the first 50 minutes.  After I punched it down and made into rolls, the rolls ran a bit and looked a bit gooey.  But, they taste great!  Good crust and crumb and french bread taste.  Also easy and inexpensive.  I'll try this one again.

These are great. My firt time working with yeast dough - I was petrified. Got a walk-through from the fantastic cooks on the AR Recipe Exchange,  and all is well. I used my KitchenAid, AP flour - ended up using about 3 2/3 cups. My first try is shaped a little weird because I was intimidated, but I'll do better next time. The recipe worked perfectly, cooking time and temp were fine. Thanks!!!

This was an incredibly easy recipe to follow. I dont usually have much luck with making bread. I used my kitchen aide and it couldnt have gone any better. Could have used a little more salt I think, or maybe a little bit more sugar. Was great as a dinner roll. Im using the left overs tomorrow for buffalo wing mini-subs.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I make these every week because the family loves them.  They are feather-lite, and delicious!  One suggestion:  When covering the dough, use a non-stick spray on parchment, then the dry towel.  The dough is VERY sticky and won't release without it.  The same holds true for after the rolls rise.  The recipe says "damp towel"...DO NOT USE A DAMP TOWEL TO COVER THIS DOUGH.  Otherwise, these are terrific!!

These were great.  Make sure kitchen is warm enough in order for the dough to rise.  I made two batches one standard and one I sprinkled cheese on top.  Both were great.

Nailed it on my second try. I found it better to have the water a little hotter than not as hot for the yeast. Also only used 3 1/2 cups of flour for the dough, and after cutting out the rolls, let them sit for 20 minutes instead of the longer time. Came out crisp (with the egg white glaze)! Very inexpensive and takes MUCH less time than you'd think to make! Wonderful choice.

I MADE THESE THIS MORNING AND THEY ARE ALL GONE! I HAD TO MAKE A SECOND BATCH SO WE CAN HAVE BREAD FOR SANDWICHES THIS WEEK. I DID DO THE EGG WASH, BUT OTHERWISE I WOULDNT CHANGE A THING. I LIKED OTHER MEMBERS IDEA OF SPRINKLING PARMESAN CHEEZE ON TOP - THAT SOUNDS GOOD!

Very delicious.  I thought I might need to brush with egg to brown, but I didn't brush them and they didn't need it.  They turned out perfectly.  I made them into sandwich size rolls and made 8 of them.  I'm not the greatest at shaping so a few looked funny, but they tasted great!

This is a great bread recipe. I didn't make rolls just into a bread that was beautiful. The only thing I done diffrently is brush the top with egg white before baking and with butter after baking. The times for raising was spot on and bake time was just right. TIP: put your oven on the lowest temp and let the top of your stove get warm it's a perfect place to raise breads. My husband and kids loved it. I will make this again.Thanks

Last night I made these rolls, followed the recipe to a tee. I was expecting to get a tasty french roll like you get at the bakery or even the bakery at a grocery store and I have to say I was disappointed. I found these to be pretty bland in taste. I don't think I will try this recipe again.

Wow! What an apt title.  I didn't get out 18 rolls, but I got 12 rolls of varying sizes and 3 bread stick thingies that I rolled in garlic, parmesan and salt.  I did use the egg wash and the rolls came out beautifully.  We toasted them with smoked gouda and it honestly tasted like something we'd get at a restaurant.  This was my first true success with bread and it seemed pretty darn fool proof.  I'm sure I over-handled it, over-kneaded it and probably over cooked it a bit and they were still fantastic.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipes exactly and they came out flat like biscuits. They weren't very tasty either. I was pretty embarassed because in my family I am known for making great breads and rolls. I don't know what I did wrong, I have made bread and rolls with other recipes at least 50 times and these were the worst ever. I noticed that all of the reviewers that rated this recipe highly stated that they changed the prep in some way, so I would say that this recipe, as stated, is not good. I'll go back to my original recipe for rolls.

Oh wow!!!  Just made these today.  They are great. Followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. I guess I made the rolls too big because I only got 13 from the recipe. As one reviewer suggested, I froze half of them to use at a later date.  I may never buy rolls again because these were so easy. Try these, you will not be sorry.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

These were simple to make and delicious to eat.  I made half the batch round rolls to go with a pasta dinner and the other half long rolls for sausages tomorrow.  I think the long rolls are a little on the small side - next time I'll just do a whole batch but make 8 bolillo style rolls instead of 16 smaller ones.  Very good - a definite keeper!

These rolls were alright, just not outstanding. A kind of weird texture for the dough once baked. Tasty, lovely dough to roll and we had them with turkey patties which everyone loved. Best warm from the oven.

I've tried several French Bread recipes, this is by far the best! I halved this recipe into one loaf and I added an extra pinch of salt. I used my bread machine to knead the dough and let it rise the first time. I formed the loaf on parchment, let it rise another 45 minutes and brushed the top of the loaf with an egg white before baking on a preheated baking stone. Great stuff!!

Where is the flavor?  I bake bread all the time, so it's not like I'm a novice, but this bread tasted nothing like bakery bread!  The textute and crust were perfect, but you taste it and nothing.  What did everone else do differently I wonder?

These are great!  Everyone loved them.  I didn't have the bread flour so I used all purpose, and they turned out perfect just the same. I also used olive oil.
  These are really quick to make too.

Super easy to make. Great taste. I did not have any bread flour so I made them with all-purpose flour and they turned out fine. I totally recommend these.

I too made them football shape & cut a little slit in the top of them but they turned out a little flat that way. The only changes I made was to let them rise 3 times, (I made them a bit too big & set them too close together on the second rising & they "melded" together some. So I reshaped them a bit smaller & let them rise again). I also put a pan of water on the rack under the bread & I didn't do an egg wash on them. Instead I chose to mist them eevry 3 minutes for the first 10 minutes of baking . This makes a crispier crust & keeps it from getting a bit too brown. They'll be rock-hard when you pull them out of the oven but w/in minutes they'll soften up & have a perfect crust. These were very good for dipping in a broth! We enjoyed them very much & they were pretty easy to make....thansk!

Nice rolls and easy recipe but they're nothing like real French bread! I knew this before making the recipe as there is no oil in the traditional French bread recipe... However, we're not purists: we truly enjoyed these rolls.

these are dangerous!!  i made the dough in my bread machine using rapid rise yeast and the quick dough cycle.  i let them rise for the full forty minutes.  the only thing i don't do is cover them-the towel stuck three times so i just let them rise without.  delicious!!!

I honestly wish there was a higher rating than five on this site! I would give these ten out of five.. they are wonderful!
I had never made bread before EVER and i was worried about what would happen, but they were absolutley perfect. I made them for a feast and i was thrilled with the results. I have just put another lot in to rise and it's only two days later! so easy, hassle  free and tasty. I'm trying it with garlic and herb, i'll let you know when they're done!

These rolls were simple to make. I am always eager to try new bread/roll recipes. I messed up and used 2 cups of reg. flour before I saw that it was supposed to be bread flour. It didn't seem to make any difference. The result was a soft, tender delicious roll. Tastes like a bakery roll!

These rolls were fine until I went to try to get the damp cloth off of them, after I had made them into balls and let them rise the 40 minutes. I couldn't get it off without completely deflating the rolls and taking some of the dough off with the cloth. I ended up having to throw the whole mess away. I used more flour like other reviewers suggested. I used paper towels, damp, not dry, rather than a damp cloth because I was afraid that the weight of the cloth (being damp and more heavy) would prevent the rolls from rising the second time. Maybe that was the problem. I even tried getting the towel wet before I removed it, like one reviewer said helped her get it off the rolls. I may try this recipe again, not sure. I think the end product would have been great, but not sure how to get there. I guess I'll try it once more and this time use a cloth rather than paper towels that were damp.

What a terrific recipe!!  I am in the process of baking 60 dozen rolls for sub sandwiches at my church and I tried this recipe, hoping for a nice, easy-to-handle dough.  I got just that!  I converted the recipe to make 48 (I have a Bosch mixer that accommodates 12 cups of flour) and got about 44 mini sub-size rolls out of it.  My husband proclaimed them "Nice and crusty on the outside with just the right chewiness inside."  Thanks for a terrific recipe!!!

I love these rolls and they are so easy when you put everything in the bread machine.  I brush them with butter before and after I bake them.  They are great with soup, spagehetti and many other recipes.

OK I dont know what I did wrong but the bread never rose and I have made yeast bread before!  I shapped the rolls into balls and they just deflated and lost there shape.  I've made french baquetts in the past and they turned out perfect.  I guess I'll just use that recipe for my dinner rolls. sigh.

I adore this recipe. It makes some of the best bread ever. I don't use  it for rolls usually. I have adopted it as "my" bread recipe. It makes about two loaves. I make once a week. Its always wonderful.

These rolls were good but not fabulous.  I made them as the recipe reads - except that I made the dough in my bread machine.  After the cycle was over, I divided the dough into eight, shaped them (best I could, very soft) into "bagettes" (would not hold into round balls) then let them rise a final time.  I did an egg white and water wash on the dough before baking.  The size was very nice for a sandwich.  The looked very odd, but tasted good.  If I were to make them again, I think I'd put the dough in texas-sized muffin pans to help it hold its shape while rising.  Stored them in a ziplock and they kept well for several days until they molded - we don't go through much bread.  Made good garlic bread when split buttered and sprinkled with garlic before toasting or broiling (I used my toaster oven).

I made french dip sandwiches with these and they turned out very good. As other reviews suggested, I cut back on the sugar and added more salt. I also tried cutting slits in the top to make them look "prettier" but I must have done something wrong because the ones I tried to cut came out lopsided and a little flattened. I thought the ones I left alone looked much better. Still a great recipe.

Again, because we had just returned from our vacation with nothing in the house, not to mention broke, I decided to make these rolls for the kids' lunches. Mine looked NOTHING like the picture but they were pretty good. I took MC-MA-OF-3's advice and cut back on the sugar and added more salt. Kids and hubby enjoyed these Jo, so thanks much!

Wonderful!  This is the first recipe on this board that I've ever had full praise for!  I weighed out the rolls...just under 4 oz each and it made 8 large hamburger bun size rolls.  They were just as good as the ones served at the best Italian restaurant in our town! My husband said he'd like a little bit more salt, so I'll try and up that a tad...but this recipe is a keeper!  Give them a try!

These were the best rolls that I've made.  They were also so easy!  I put all the ingredients in my bread machine, set it to the dough mode and came back in an hour and a half. Then just rolled them into balls and baked them.  I highly recommend these and I'll definitely be making these weekly!  Thanks Jo!

My family loved these rolls.  I was also making bread at the time and kneaded the rolls on whole wheat flour by accident.  It gave them a really neat texture.

...Thought they were pretty easy too make, But found them too be a little on the flat side ,as far as taste goes?...I would probably add a little more salt next time, and maybe more sugar?
  Great recipe for kids ,because of the level of difficulty."Easy"

I made a french bread loaf by hand with this recipe and it is so easy.  I was done in no time!  I just set the timer to let it rise and forgot about it. The kids loved it and asked when I will be making it again.

really good...i'm a bread lover and i have to say this is one of the best dinner rolls i ever had. I did use a bit more flour since it did got a bit sticky to knead the bread, maybe i used a bit too much water at first. (watch out for that if you're picky about the calorie intake since more flour means more calorie ;) ) extremely good fresh out of the oven...got loads of compliments when i made them.

Great rolls!  I have made these at least five times already and my family keeps asking for more.  I made the dough in the bread machine then rolled it out and baked in the oven.  Very easy, very good.

Found this recipe on Pinterest! I fell in love with it right away. I used to use a different recipe that called for a lot of dairy ingredients, and it was complicated, however the results are as good as this one. I love the simplicity of this recipe and how delicious it turns out. I will actually make it today for the 10th time. I'll date to use olive oil and add some spices to it. I think the recipe is flexible enough to be able to change the flavor of the bread! I do put a bowl of boiling water at the bottom track of my oven to add humidity and crispness to the crust

Fantastic recipe. The only thing I changed was I always combine all my dry ingredients together in a separate bowl to ensure they're mixed well. Put all the wet ingredients into your mixer bowl, and add the dry into it. 

Fantastic taste, and texture!

I made rolls.  They turned out good.  No egg white on top, they browned okay.  I felt like there should of been a little something extra in the taste, maybe a bit of garlic next time.

Made these a while back and very impressed with how good and easy they were to make. Making them again today, and going to form bread sticks with part of the dough. Like crunchy bread sticks so this should work out good for that. Last time the rolls I made were on the larger size so cut the top off and scooped out the insides and made small soup bowls. Very good. Will make bread bowls one of these days. Thanks for sharing.

As close to a perfect roll for me. I like the easy ingredients and no-fuss instructions. I make the dough in the bread machine, which makes it even easier. Throw the wet ingredients in, then the dry.

These rolls are very good. I added one cup of whole wheat flour this time and also some gluten because I didn't have bread flour. They turned out great. Everyone I have ever served these to loves them!

This recipe has become my favorite, to serve my family at any time of day... And every single time they bake and taste so wonderful! Before i place these rolls in over i brush the top of each one with either melted butter or one wisked egg. Which will give the rolls that crispy texture with golden apearance. I Follow instructions to the T. Thank you fot this wonderful delicious roll recipe.

My son and I made this recipe.  The rolls turned out light and delicious!  We made this exactly as stated.  We cut the rolls, placed Ham and Cheese with mayo on them for school lunches.  A big hit!

Fantastic! I have made like recipe states as well as in the bread maker. In bread maker I have used the dough then continued from the point of forming the rolls. I have also made as a loaf in the bread maker. They all came out perfect!

When I first made this recipe, it wasn't as melt in your mouth as how I make them now. Maybe it was my fault, the air was too dry or something, but I make them now as my second mainstay roll recipe for dinners. I use the Burger or Hot Dog Buns recipe from this site for my other roll recipe and to make awesome burger/hot dog buns. Anyway, I decided to try something different the other night. I added 3-4 T honey instead of the sugar (although not necessary) and split the dough in half. I made half into rolls and the other half into a copycat Papa Murphy's S'mores pizza (see DancingwithCinderella.com). We loved the rolls and we loved the dessert pizza--actually tastes like Papa Murphy's. So yummy! I also use my bread machine to do all the work of mixing and needing the dough. Great recipe!

These are good except they are kind of tasteless and too much sugar. Next time I will take out 1 teaspoon of sugar. Maybe 1 teaspoon more salt next time? Also, i added a spread to the top that added a smidge of flavor to it. I took a sliver of melted butter (probably a little less than 1 teaspoon) and added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and a few shakes of salt. Spread this on the rolls right after taking them out of the oven. This is an OK recipe but I would recommend it.

I can't tell you how many times I've made these wonderful rolls, but what I can tell you is how amazing they are. Such a huge hit and you can play with the recipe a little. I sometimes add olive oil in place of vegetable oil and bake it in a loaf on stoneware. Stoneware makes for the best results. Then I'll make little crustinies out of it! Hope you enjoy as much as my husband and I do :-)

excellent recipe. The rolls came out beautifully golden with a nice crisp crust. Very tasty, they could probably use just a tad more salt, but that's just personal preference. I also substituted olive oil instead of veg' oil. 5/5!

Although not the same as bakery rolls, these were still quite good.  I used the following suggestions. 1) Bake on the lowest rack in the oven. 2) Spritzed with water a few times (using ice cubes would have been better, but I wasn't brave enough to throw ice cubes onto the bottom of the oven). 3) Coated the pizza stone with whole wheat flour instead of cornmeal to prevent sticking. 4) Dusted the rolls with flour to create that more authentic French roll look.  5) Snipped the tops of each roll with scissors in an X-pattern.

Okay. Oh my gosh! Despite my mad bread making skillz, I always buy those brown and serve rolls for holiday meals because I have never found anything as soft and fluffy. These are amazing, I don't ever need to buy those again! So very easy. I didn't egg wash, but brushed with melted butter immediately upon pulling out. I also used an olive/grapeseed/canola oil mix and after placing them (15 instead) in a 6x9 casserole dish, I coated the tops with olive oil for the second rise instead of covering with a damp towel. I've also baked them in an oven-safe pan that was coated with bacon grease, nice crispy fried bottom. So awesome!

Made these with a bread maker and made 8 larger rolls instead of 16 smaller ones.  With 8, you could make small sandwiches with leftovers.  They were yummy! :)

I have made this dough 5 different times now. I have shaped it as dinner rolls, baguettes and batards. It always comes through for me. All of my friends and family love the taste and texture of the loaves. I've cooked it in my oven in the kitchen and in my outdoor ceramic oven which is my Big Green Egg. It is becoming my go to bread dough.

I have been making these rolls for a long time and they are always good and have become a family favorite.  I have on grandson that can eat four or five at a time!   I always have the basic ingredients needed to make this recipe so I can whip them up without having to make a trip to the grocery store and that is a big plus in my busy world.

I was looking for something more than your traditional dinner roll and I found it.  This bread is best fresh when the inside is still soft and the outside is hard and chewy.  I will say though, think about what the instructions are saying before following them.  I followed the instructions to a T and after putting a damp cloth over the formed rolls all that happened is they all stuck to the cloth and I had to reform all of the rolls.  Still kicking myself for doing that.

My family and friends all love these rolls!  I followed the recipe exactly, using my bread machine to mix and knead.  I did have to adjust the time in my oven to 15 minutes, but ovens do vary a bit, so I was watching closely the first time anyway.  We can't wait to try the loaves and pizza dough!  The crust is hard when the rolls first come out of the oven, but softens as they cool.  I even love them cold and plain!   Thanks so much, JOCATLIN!!!

Fantastic! I made these as bread instead of rolls and it was great! I suppose the egg wash would have been perfect for many rolls, but a bit extra left over for 2 loaves of bread.

This is a great recipe. I've even personalized it by using flavored oils or added herbs. Be mindful of the a mounts though. It is for a two pound machine. It was quite a scene when my dough outgrew my machine. No big deal, I just adjusted the recipe to 12 servings using the handy tool provided by the website.

My first time making these and they were amazing! I followed the recipe to a "T" and even added the egg wash. So simple and easy to follow. I was making bbq sandwiches and wanted to put in in a roll and really didn't want to run to the supermarket. My husband just bought me a Kitchen Aid, so  I made the dough in there and it was amazing! Love, love, love this recipe! I only needed 13-14 minutes in my oven because it's convection.

Very nice rolls.  They turned out soft and chewy inside but sturdy.  Perfect for Easy slow cooker french dip sandwiches from this site.  Followed the recipe but shaped them into longer hot dog shaped rolls instead of round ones.  Placed the ingredients in the bread machine and after the dough cycle was complete I formed the rolls, let them rise about 40 mins, then added the egg wash and baked.  Will definitely make these again.

They were fabulous and so easy to make.  The only thing I may do differently next time is add some sesame seeds on top and perhaps make a loaf instead of rolls.  This is a keeper.

My husband called these rolls addicting - especially after putting butter and honey on them warm out of the oven.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine. Shaped them into rolls, but did not brush with egg wash and they were fantastic.  Reminded me of a good soft hamburger roll.  I will definitely make these again and again.

My sincerest apologies for this rating, but this bread was just. not. good. :( Now, I love to make bread, and make it as often as possible, so I'm no beginner at this. I followed the recipe to a "t," except I only put in 3 cups of flour, and I added parmesan cheese just to give it oomph. Unfortunately, no oomph, just blech. Again, my apologies jocatlin, but not up to my family's and my par.

These were good, but too sweet for me. I don't think french bread is sweet and to me you could really taste the sugar. I made it exactly as called for so maybe just reducing the sugar would bump this up to a 5 star for me?

i followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  The only difference is I didn't use all the flour. After adding the 2 cups of flour, I added the rest if the flour slowly until the dough held together. I then kneaded and added flour as needed.  I baked some on a sheet pan and baked some on a baking stone.  I preferred the stone baked rolls better.  The bottom was a bit more crunchy.  I used cornmeal for the pizza peel to move the rolls to the stone.  HTH

I've made these several times now and love the recipe. I usually add just a touch of honey if i want sweet rolls but the recipe is perfect the way it is. I use the bread machine and then just do a final rise once they are in the pan.

I made these last evening to take to a company supper to serve with chili. I made them in long bread sticks, and used instant yeast instead of regular. I just added the dry ingredients to a bowl (2 cups  flour, add the rest in the mixing and kneeding process), put the water and oil in another, then mixed the two together. The dough was fantastic, and easy to kneed. The smell of it baking in the oven was to die for, and the texture of the bread was just perfect. Best recipe ive ever used to make bread rolls from scratch.

I really like this bread recipe. I use it to make sandwich rolls. I make very few changes and it comes out great. 2x the sugar, 1.5x the salt, use olive for vegetable oil that's basically it. I've learned through trial and error that for the size of the rolls I want I can weigh the dough for 3.5 oz and it's perfect. At this size I generally get 10-12 rolls. Perfect for sandwiches. Nice and chewy texture. Thanks for the submission.

Delightful!  Wonderfully crunchy on exterior - soft and fluffy interior.  I made half a recipe and came out with 7 fairly nice sized rolls of apx 2oz each.  I did as someone suggested and sprinkled cornmeal on the bottom of pan, but aside from that made exactly as directed.  Baked at 400 for 17 minutes and removed them just in time (barely).  Next time I will only bake for 16 minutes.  For a change I nixed the glaze and am thrilled as they were perfect as is.  Thank you so much - this will be a definate stable in our household.

This was a good roll recipe. I decided to make this last minute, and I wipped it out fast. I did add some Italian herbs as I was making Italian for dinner. I would make this again, but like the French Baguette recipe a little better.

These rolls are absolutely fantastic!  I used all purpose flour, and they were perfect!   Exactly the dinner rolls I had in mind, though they will also work perfectly as Brat buns or for hamburgers!  I also made half into a loaf; it worked just as well.

Excellent!! I substituted 1/2 cup of lukewarm milk for 1/2 up of the water and doubled (yes, doubled) the yeast.
Try these in a greased (only, no flour) 8 x 8 square pan, making four rows of four rolls each. Dip the bottom of each roll into cornmeal for a fabulous crunch. Proof these amazing pieces of heaven right in the pan for the 40 minutes sugggested, covered with greased plastic wrap. Egg wash with a splash of milk added and a sprinkle of kosher salt on top and presto...heaven on a plate!! Stand back...there will be a stampeed!

Great recipe!  I divide the dough into 12 rolls instead of 16 and they are a perfect size for deli sandwiches for the kids' school lunches.

I don't know about "to die for", but these are pretty good.  I forgot to pick up sturdy rolls/bread for French Dip Sandwiches this morning, and instead of heading back to the store, figured I'd give this recipe a shot.  I used the bread machine which was easy and then formed about 7 oblong rolls.  They were delicious!  I do think the addition of a little honey might be good, too, because on their own, they are slightly bland.  (I also used EVOO instead of Veg Oil by accident - don't know if it makes a difference in the long run.)

I used this recipe to make french baguettes. I made the dough in my bread machine, formed the baguettes, let them double in size and brushed the dough with some olive oil. 18 minutes later my house smelled like a bakery and the bread was golden brown, slightly crispy on the outside and so light and fluffy throughout the middle. My family loved it and I'm happy I've found such a simple and delicious french bread recipe!

These are simply fantastic rolls. Mine were a little flatter, but perfect for hamburgers, sandwiches or just butter! Fabulous. I followed the recipe except for (of course) used a dough hook to do the kneading. Teresa

I think these are great, they go great with honey butter... after I first put mine in the oven I sprayed them with water and had a shallow water pan in the oven to get more of a french bread crust...other than that I didn't change the recipe at all and I've made these about 5 times now they are super easy for a beginning bread cook like myself

These rolls were okay.  Good while hot, but not to die for.  They go stale very quickly - within hours.  The dough is easy to work with and they do have a good crust, but they are in no way like French bread. I suspect the dough would make a very nice pizza crust, but aside from that I probably wouldn't bother to make them again.

I would probably give these rolls a 4.5. I do not have a breadmaker and was looking for a recipe that would turn out great bread without the machine. I think this recipe definitely does that. The rolls have a great texture. The crust is thin but golden and lightly crispy while, the inside is light but not spongy. Flavor-wise they are tasty but in my opinion could use a little more. Perhaps just some onion salt or maybe adding fresh rosemary and seasalt too to get a nice aromatic bread. If you add some rosemary you'll probably want to bruise the leaves to release the flavor and scent. These rolls will be replacing store bought ones. Also, I made these with all purpose flour instead of bread flower and they were still great. Try them!

I have been making bread for years and this is by far the best!  I did add some Parmesan cheese and garlic and it was awesome.  I also threw everything in the breadmaker on the dough cycle and then baked them.  Fantastic!  I would give this 10 stars if I could

A bit bland but easy to make. My rolls didn't rise the way I wanted it to be. I did like the crust on the bottom but no so much for the top.

I use this recipe for EVERYTHING! So good! Ive formed them into hamburger rolls, hot dog rolls, pizza crust, bread sticks, even bread bowls. So yummy every time. I've noticed when making actual bread loaves you need to make sure you allow them to rise enough before baking. Turning the oven onto 100 and then shutting it off works great to help bread rise. Just make sure the oven is off before you throw the bread in there to rise.  :)

This came out fabulous! I made mine into a loaf rather than rolls and cooked it on a pizza stone and it came out perfect. I also added 1.5 tsp of honey as noted by another viewer and decreased the amount of flour I used to 3 cups since I used all-purpose flour. I gradually added in about another 1/2 cup while I kneaded the dough and it came out well> Great recipe!

I've made a few bread recipes using my bread maker but this by far is my favorite!! it is easy, uses simple ingredients and are ohhh sooo yummy!!  The only changes were 1) allowing the yeast and sugar to proofin the water for 10 minutes before adding the flour in the bread machine as recommended by another recipe on this site, 2) usedg olive oil instead of vegetable and 3) added a 1.5 tsp of honey.  They turned out so light and fluffy on the inside and crusty on the outside... Perfect!  You've got to try these rolls I promise you'll love them!!!

Very good rolls.  Didn't change anything, but didn't leave them in the oven as long as directed because my kids don't really like a hard crust.  Everyone really liked these.

This recipe certainly is easy, as it states!  But leave it to me to mess it up.  These did not turn out so great for me, but I will certainly be giving them another try.  I'm still amateur in bread-making, so I'm sure I will be adjusting my rating as I try them again!  The ease of making the dough and their sourdough-like taste are enough to make me want to try them again.

These turned out pretty good - I'm just glad I kept my eye on the dough while it was in my bread machine. It was very sticky, and I needed to add a more than 1/2 cup of extra flour and knead it again.  Next time I will brush them butter and egg whites as another reviewer had suggested. Also, I used multi-grain bread flour.

I was looking for the "perfect roll" recipe for Thanksgiving and this is it!  I wasn't able to get the rise I wanted in spacing the balls/rolls of dough 2 inches apart; as soon as I placed the rolls touching in a round, greased pan, the rise and texture was perfect.  I also just used a tea towel over the dough/rolls in rising, found that the damp towel stuck too much to the rolls.  But the second time I made them, they were perfection and just what I was looking for!  Thanks!

Really good and easy. Things with yeast normally scare me because I don't have a bread maker. But this recipe is pretty fool proof. The rolls taste best right out of the oven while the outside is still crisp (and with lots of butter) Mmmm yummy. Oh and the rolls should only be cooked for about 13 minutes.

I am new to bread making and these were a big hit with the family.  My only problem was, the damp cloth...the dough balls stuck to the towel.  They weren't ruined but several lost some shape.  I will learn...thank you for sharing.

These were excellent.  I made half the batch for dinner and made a combination of rolls, some filled with leftover chicken and some plain.  They were delicious, and cooked well with the chicken/pepper mix inside them in 15 minutes.

These rolls were great. I brushed them with an water/egg wash for a high gloss finish. Loved them, will be baking again.

These are really very easy to make, and they look great, but they don't have a lot of taste. Nothing wrong with the recipe, I just was expecting more of a pronounced taste. Thanks for the recipe!

These are simply amazing!  I did change it quite a bit though.... These rolls work fine in a breadmaker, just add the water, oil, sugar, salt, flour, and yeast in that order.  add at least a fourth of a cup extra of flour. Let it rise in the breadmaker or follow the recipe's directions for rising before baking.    You could also just shape it into two long baguettes or eight sandwich rolls. Then let raise in a warm place.  The egg wash is a great idea, and you could also add sesame seeds for an extra flare.  Follow the original baking directions, and you should have some great rolls to eat!  Good Luck!

Lovely crunchy crust and tender crumb.  Was slightly bland, maybe a bit more salt.  I had to use more flour but it was damp in my kitchen.  I also had a hard time with them spreading out too much but I just rerolled after the last rise and they came out o.k.

Turned out perfect, followed instructions exactly (actually I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour), but they were still beautiful and soft. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great! Nice and soft on the inside, with a great crust on the outside. I let proof and rise a little longer than the instructions.

Very good results here for a first time "roll" maker! I didn't do the egg wash for the tops, because I simply forgot, but a novice baker could make these with great results! These were great straight out of the oven with a pat of butter with dinner, but the next day the texture greatly changes. I do highly recommend these to anyone wanting to make rolls, they were a bit chewy for my taste, but everyone I served these to loved them. Thanks for the recipe :)

I halved the recipe and made it yesterday as well as today.  Both times prepared a little different (although used the dough setting on my bread machine).  That being said this is what I've  noticed.  The first time  I followed recipe, but noticed while mixing, it was a bit dry so I added more water which i eyeballed until it became it became elastic.  I was kind of worried about the temp of the oven and when bake, 400 seemed too high and started to burn  the bottom of the rolls about 10 minutes into cooking, so I had to take them out, even though they were not browned.  Fast forward to today, added 1/4 c more water, baked @ 350 and instead of the egg and water used ice water instead which worked just as well.  pretty good basic recipe with a little tweaking.  may try to make a full loaf of french bread with it with revisions.

damp towel + sticky dough = big mess!  I rushed through making this recipe without really looking at it or checking out the reviews. Unfortunately, the rolls deflated when I pulled the towel off. I tried giving them another rise, but lost half the batch. The ones I baked tasted okay, but looked like large hockey pucks! I will try this recipe again after reading the reviews and making my own changes.

Delicious!  I chopped up fresh rosemary and added it to the dough.  Topped the rolls with an egg wash, fresh rosemary, and sea salt.  They really were to die for!

My husband and I are hooked on these!  Its so nice to be able to use the bread machine for the kneading so all you do is shape and bake.  My grandchildren really enjoy them also and want often for me to make them.  One day soon I hope to get them here to help me make some.  They like to make brownies so sure they could do this with no problem.  Never really to young to indtroduce them to the kitchen.  Many happy memories!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I read some of the other reviews and made some minor modifications.  Changed the oven temp to 375 and cooked for 19 minutes, used olive oil instead of veg. oil and lightly misted the rolls with water every 5 minutes during cooking to make the crust a little crunchier.  They were still only a slightly crunchy.  I did use my Kitchen Aid to kneed the dough the first time for ease.  I thought these were very good but would like a little bit more flavor.  Next time I might add sea salt or some other herb to the top before cooking to just give them a little extra something.  Thanks for the recipe Jo!

TO DIE FOR!!! Make these rolls. I used AP flour instead of bread flour. The dough is a dream to work with. It only took 3 and 3/4 cup of flour. The result is perfection, lightly crispy on the outside and soft, pillowy and fluffy on the inside. So good!! I can not make these too often or I will eat them all and get fat. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Love this recipe. It's quick, easy, and my husband loves them! I like to split the batch in 3rds after the first rise and freeze 2/3rds for later. Then I use it for pizzas, calzones, etc.

This recipe is perfect!  I followed the recipe/instructions exactly and my rolls came out crunchy on the outside (especially the bottoms - I baked on my stoneware) and light, airy and soft on the inside.  They browned perfectly and have just a hint of sour-taste to them, making them taste like real french bread.  These were a breeze to throw together by hand - I can't wait to make them again!

My boyfriend is very picky and said this was the best bread I've ever made. He eats half a toasted bun every morning with his coffee so I have been on a mission to find a good recipe that I could mass produce and freeze to save money. This is it! Thanks for the good and easy recipe. BTW...I mixed/did first rise in my bread machine. Then formed 8 balls and let them rise again. 400degrees 20 min. Perfection.

I made these tonight to go along with the Corned beef and Cabbage I, from this site. I followed the recipe and the only thing I did different was to bush a little butter on top after they came out of the oven. I was a little worried when I ate one before the company got here as it tasted a little bland and thought about what some of the reviewers said about increasing the salt but during the dinner, everybody was raving about the rolls and sure enough when you added regular salted butter to the rolls they became amazing! Will use this recipe again!

I put these in a pan (round cake pan, actually) and let them rise for quite a while.  Then I brushed the top with melted butter and sprinkled sea salt and rosemary on the top, baked and brushed again with butter.  Because I didn't put them on a pan, they were all stuck together, but it didn't change the way they tasted!  They were even good after they sat out on the stove all night!  For the crusty outside, brushing with egg whites would probably help.  I also baked them at  a different temperature (was using the dough for another recipe).  This dough is so versatile!  YUM.

These were very easy to make.  I think I cooked them for a bit too long, because the bottoms were burned.  The taste was very good.  I made two batches, one with minced garlic & melted butter drizzled on the top and the other batch was just plain.  Both turned out very good.

This was tasty, but needed more salt... next time I'll use twice as much salt as called for.

Absolutely phenomenal. I would certainly die for them. Simply Superb. Made them to go with my Gumbo and already wanting to make another batch.

This one gets 3 or 4 stars. It was nothing fabulous to me. I liked them out of the oven with butter, but the next day they were a little bland and I even added an extra 1/2 t. salt when I made them per other suggestions. The dough didn't form into round smooth  balls like the picture-it was a little tricky to work with such thick dough, so I wouldn't serve them to guests. I used my Kitchen Aid dough hook and it was getting a little over heated by 7-8 min keading. I also decreased the oven temp to 375 and approx. 19 min worked for me.

I hate to knead, I really do...however I wanted to try these rolls and they are very good.  I put them in a muffin tin and they turned out beautifully.  I had a few left over from last night, so today I scooped them out, heated them up and put in Baked Potato Soup from this site.  A fabulous lunch.

I made this recipe yesterday, following it to the letter. I used my bread maker for the dough and it made a HUGE loaf of french bread plus 4 large buns. I will try it again but halving the recipe. It was awesome. My partner loved it.

Turned out great. I used wheat flour and olive oil. Added some garlic powder and dill. Next time, I think I will leave out the sugar and salt. I also made a slit in the top of a few of the rolls and stuffed a jalapeno slice and some spicy manchego cheese. Those were eaten first! Maybe I'll do them all that way next time. I also brushed some olive oil on them towards the end. Cooking time is a bit off, at 200 C they were done in about 10-12 minutes.

I made my dad a box of his favorite food for father's day, and these rolls went into it.  They really are TO DIE FOR.  I made them by hand, not in the breadmaker.  I increased the recipe by 1/2 to yeild two dozen rolls.  I sent a dozen in my dad's box, kept six for us, and put the other six in the freezer unbaked for another day.  They are very good (especially with some cinnamon honey butter), and my dad loved them too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think that 400 degrees F is a bit too high: My rolls came out a bit dry and they were slightly over-browned on the outside.

I am in the minority here but mine turned out hard and tasteless.  The thing is, I followed the recipe as is and used the bread maker.  Don't know what I did but won't be making this again.

I made the dough in my bread machine, then shaped it into rolls for baking.  I also put half of it in the fridge for another day, but the dough expanded and seeped out of the Press N Seal wrap it was stored in!  The dough was a bit sticky, but some spray helped with that.  I probably shouldn't have done it, but before baking, I brushed my rolls with butter. OH MAN was that ever good!  I don't know what they'd taste like without it, but I doubt I'll ever find out!

I definitely would not die for these though they were good.  The only thing I changed was using whole wheat flour, but I'm gussing that made things very different.  Good, but no need to make them regularly.

I know it said rolls but I used this recipe to make "French" bread bowls for my French Beef Stew. I made 4 medium bread bowls using the original recipe. Also, I used this recipe for the buns in Eggplant Sandwiches. It was great! I made 4 buns and made a loaf for Balsamic Bruschetta.

I have made this several times now. The rolls are great, good crust and tender center. I also make longer rolls for sandwitches. If you like a good crust the egg wash is a must.

For those who want a crustier roll, try placing a pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven.  I thought these were very good, especially considering how little time was involved.  For comparison, I tried a much more complicated recipe from my bread book.  That one includes adding two stiffly beaten egg whites, butter instead of oil, and nearly four hours of time to raise the dough.  The family's verdict was that it wasn't worth the extra time.  The flavor really wasn't fabulously better, so I'm still on a quest for the perfect recipe, but this one's not bad for now!

Fantastic!  I've made alot of homemade breads, and I always have my husband rate them so I know for future.  This is the first recipe he has ever said "PERFECT" and with excitment!  SUper easy to make too.  This will be a staple in our house I can see.

Easy, and turnout out great.  BUT the wet cloth stuck to them and I had to re-raise.  Not sure why all these recipes tell you to lay a towel on the raising dough.  DON'T.

Easy and delectable. I made the recipe exactly as written. There's nothing that needs to be changed. I only baked them for 18 minutes and they were perfect! Soft texture inside and very crusty outside. In the future, I will make more and freeze the leftovers.

The heck with the local bakery on Sunday mornings. These rolls are PERFECT!  As another reviewer wrote, I brushed w/melted butter and sprinkled with kosher salt just prior to baking, and these were outstanding. I used my bread machine "dough cycle" and followed recipe from there. I also used my pizza stone with a silicone mat on top to avoid having sticking. These were a huge hit, half were gone before dinner was even served.  Thanks for this amazing recipe. This will be a regular in my home for sure!

These were nice and fluffy but I prefer French bread to be crustier. I made 12 rolls and they came out huge, but they all fit on one cookie sheet. I also sprinkled the cookie sheet with cornmeal.

I thought these turned out alright, but my husband LOVED them. The photo makes the bread look like it has a slight glossy sheen, my rolls turned out very dry. Also, in the picture they almost look like round balls, but mine were more like hamburger rolls. If I made them again I might try an egg wash. I added some honey to the recipe and I am glad I did, they still weren't as flavorful as I would have liked, but this is a nice, solid recipe and my husband ate the rolls like they were going out of style. Thank you.

I liked this recipe a lot because it's crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, just like french bread is supposed to be.  I want to add that 18-20 minutes baking time is much too long though. Next time I'll divide my dough into 10 balls so I can make large sandwiches from it.

These rolls wer wonderful! They reminded my family of a recipe from our Aunt in VA. whose recipes are always, " a handful of this and a pinch of that..." We brushed the tops with melted butter before the rolls had risen. This is the recipe I've been looking for. THANQ!

I don't know what I did wrong or who else reviewed this recipe, but they most certainly did NOT turn out well.  The flavor was not only bland, but it was bad.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving, so much so that I was asked to make them again for Christmas. My only comment is that they were a very mild flavor, which might be great depending on what you're looking for. This time I'm going to follow another reviewer's advice and double the salt and sugar. Also, it's important that you kneed the bread for the whole time, you wont regret it! Other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

These are wonderful! I made these for our Thanksgiving dinner & I've made four more batches since. They make great little sandwich rolls too.
*I made the dough in my bread maker.

I made two loaves of bread instead of rolls with this.  It turned out REALLY good!  Following advice I once saw on an episode of Alton Brown's show on TV Food Network, I spritzed the loaves with water every 5 minutes while they were baking.  This resulted in a nice chewy crust.  Next time I think I'll use olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make the flavor even better.  Thanks for a great bread recipe!

This is one of our favorite breads. If you let the dough overproof a little and then bake it becomes like a ciabatta bread. We love this recipe.

For me, these were just okay.  I used all purpose flour, which rose just fine, but I ended up letting them rise too long - so they deflated.  However, the flavor was nothing out of the ordinary.  I'll stick with fresh bread rather than these rolls.

Oh my goodness- what a pleasant surprise!  It's my first time ever making bread and it came out absolutey delicious.  I followed tips from others and used my Kitchen Aid mixer and followed recipe exactly as written.  The rolls were soft 3 days later wrapped in a tea towel.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I made this all by hand.   I recomend starting the flower at 1/2 cup each time, then stir until smooth and creamy each time.  Keep adding flower by a 1/2 cup.   I added 1/3 cup of choped garlic, 2 tablespoons of Basil and 1 Tablespoon of Rosemary.   I did the egg white glaze with 1 teaspoon of cream in the mix instead of water.   

WOWOWOW!  These were great.  I gave some to my neighbors and they loved them as well.  I now know what to do for thanksgiving bread.

I used my bread machine to make the dough. These were not as good as I expected. I will brush the tops of the rolls with something next time, because they didn't look very good. At least they tasted pretty good. Also, it makes about 8 regular sized sandwich rolls (I served Easy Slow Cooker French Dips on these). I thought that it would make more since the recipe says that it serves 16.

I don't know what happened.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I've made bread lots of times before - but this turned out to be soft, pillowy white bread.  Very tasty, but not the crusty, chewy bread I was looking for.

I made these rolls today with my bread machine.  Oh my, so good.  I made these to go with the "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip" from this site.  If you haven't tryed this wonderful pull-apart sandwich meat recipe-you are missing out on a great, hot sandwich.  I brushed the rolls with eggs whites and baked on my pizza stone.  AWESOME!!  Thx for sharing.

This is a GREAT recipe!! Very easy - I used the bread machine and I used my kitchen scale to be sure they were all sized about the same.  I misted them with water right before I put them in the oven and they turned out great - crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside!!

Easy aand quick to make. The first time I got really heavy rolls because I added more flour(about 1+ c.) than the recipe called for due to the summer humidity. The second time I used only 1/4 c. more than the amount called for. The dough felt a little sticky but the resulting rolls were marvelous!

This is a great recipe. I really like it! It is very flexible, I have made it into a loaf, hoggie rolls, and they all turned out great!  Now I'm trying it out with wheat flour instead of the white flour. It makes great sandwich bread light and fluffy.

These were very good... a little plain by themselves but a good taste... and very good with butter or as I followed from one reviewer brushing it with garlic/butter/oregano... I need to try them again as mine slightly flattened out... but overall they were very good.

I did not have bread flour the first time I made these.  I used half AP and half Wheat and they were great.  The next time I did and I could not tell too much of a differerence.  I have also used the dough to make pizza and it work out great.  I had to precook the dough for about 8 min before adding toppings though.

The name for these rolls is accurate! They are wonderful. I made the dough in my bread machine on the 'dough' setting and let them rise for the first time in the machine, then punched them down and formed them by hand. The dough was easy to roll and form and they made my kitchen smell heavenly while they were baking. I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes and they were perfect. The crust was nice and chewy and the centers pillowy and soft, like fresh french bread should be. I will definitely make these again and again.

These are so easy and soooo good! Just remember that they will rise alot. 2" balls will become at least 4" rolls. If you put a smear of butter or margerine on the tops of each roll as soon as they come out of the oven it will prevent a hard crust. Soft chewy butter top rolls are my families favorite, and these are fabulous.

These were very good!  Unfortunately I did not have bread flour.  So I used ALL Purpose, which worked but my rolls did not rise as much as I would have expected them to.  Either way, they were excellent!  And very easy!  Also I used EVOO rather than Veg. Oil.  I made the dough in my bread machine.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

LOVED these!  Didn't even have to get out my mixer.  Just mix with a spoon.  They were super easy & delicious.  As soon as they came out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter mixed w/ salt, pepper, oregano, shredded parmesan & garlic powder.  I've eaten three of them tonight & am so tempted to go for #4!  I served them with spaghetti & meatballs.

These are absolutely fabulous! They are so easy to make, you cannot screw them up! First, I used expired yeast :S, then, I didn't have enough flour, so I made half a batch, and added all-purpose flour to the bread flour to complete the last 1/4 cup. I blended everything in the food processor and did not use all the flour, I guess it was a humid day. Anyway, most of the kneading was done very easily in the processor, and I only kneaded the last 2 minutes by hand. It made 4 medium sized balls. I followed everything else exactly. I placed the buns into an 8X8 pyrex pan. The fluffed up so nicely while baking, and became beautiful pull-apart delicous buns! Sllightly crusty on the outside, and so fluffy and moist on the inside. My son couldn't stop eating them! Perfect with any kind of cheese!Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

I made these last night and they were GREAT.  This was the first time baking bread with yeast – not ‘quick bread’.  I found it somewhat easy, of course I do have the Kitchenaid Mixer! I always scan through other reviews and suggestions.  This time I followed RAINBOWELP’s review, as well as some others:…… “Also only used 3 1/2 cups of flour for the dough”…..“TIP - don't over-rise it the 2nd time or else you could get a dry loaf. Follow the rise times if you want it moist and chewy. I doubled the salt and sugar for more flavor.”…….“TIP: put your oven on the lowest temp and let the top of your stove get warm it's a perfect place to raise breads”…..“Upped the salt a bit”------------ I added a bit extra salt, basically a heaping teaspoon, and added an extra half of the sugar – I like it sweet.  When proofing, the towel did stick, but the second raising I used a suggestion to spray the towel every so often to keep it moist, as well as right before I took the towel off – perfect.  There are 3 of us, so I made 12 rolls – and they were big, I can’t imagine how huge they were for those who made only 6 or 8.  I am not a novice, but there are things I haven’t tried yet, and this is one of them.  Another reviewer said they split the tops of the rolls, so I wanted to as well.  I probably should’ve looked up how to cut the dough before hand.  I ended up using to steak knives, holding them straight up in the middle of the roll, with the serrated edges facing outwards and then simultaneously

I've made these twice and everyone loves them  .The only thing I do different is use  regular white flour and i increase the salt by a half  a teaspoon . Make sure to cook on a high rack in your oven.

I use the egg white on top before I bake  and it makes them lovely and brown.

These were good, basic rolls.  I took them to a family dinner and everyone ate one but nobody really raved and had to have more.  In fact, nobody commented on them at all until my mom told everyone I had made them myself, then everyone said they were good.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough (it overflowed!-but that was ok) and then formed them into rolls and let them rise again before baking.  The dough was really sticky and a bit hard to work with so I had to add more flour.  They smelled great while baking and tasted good too.  I can see how they would be good with some kind of seed or herb topping, but as is they are lacking some flavor and are a bit bland; just a basic roll.

These are fabulous.  I made rolls and loaves.  I received so many compliments at Thanksgiving dinner...I am making a second batch for leftovers at a friends house.  I did use all-purpose flour... about 4 1/3 cups.  I also added 2 Tablespoons of honey.  
I threw everything in the bread maker on the dough setting.  Pulled it out 90 minutes later and shaped them into rolls.  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe.

Fantastic, delicious rolls.  Light and fluffy.  I made the dough in my bread machine and used olive oil for the oil. Update: I tried this recipe as pizza crust; I was short on time so added extra yeast; if you like French Bread pizza, this is great, but it was a tad too sweet for me, but my kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe, Jo!

Great texture, and not difficult to make.  However, this is a plain roll, and its flavor is nothing worth bragging about on its own.  It does go nicely with jam or other spreads!

This has become one of my favourite recipes.  No one believes these rolls are homemade but they're actually so easy they almost make themselves.  I've found that I like to decrease the sugar slightly and increase the salt slightly - just a personal preference.  I put the dough inside my over-the-stove microwave for both rises (to keep it away from any drafts) and turn the light on over the stove so it keeps the inside of the oven just slightly warm.  I also don't cover the rolls when they're in there for the second rise. I've made these twice for company this week alone.

Wonderful!  Turned out soft and delicous!  I didn't use an egg wash for the top because I didnt want them to get hard on the outside and the still ended up turning a golden color.  We used them for a french dip slow cooker recipe from this site.

I searched for a recipe for Kimelweck rolls (Polish salted rolls with caraway seeds) but to no avail.  This recipe worked great.  I rolled the dough 1" thick and cut them with a 4" cutter then brushed the tops with egg whites and sprinkled on Kosher salt and caraway seeds before baking.  Worked great for "Beef on Wek" sandwiches. (Mounds of sliced deli roast beef sliced thin, horseradish and au jus for dipping.)

I have this recipe handwritten in my "all time favorites" recipe box from when we first made them over two years ago.  Today they looked outstanding, just like in the picture.  I made a note on my card to buy a pretty salt to add to the top next time.  We just used a dash of regular table salt on some of the tops and it really made the flavor stand out.  Great recipe -- easy enough for beginners.

I made 8 rolls and 4 buns (for French Dip).  This bread tasted just like the french bread I buy from the store!  Generally I like soft rolls, but this recipe was great if you are looking for a crispier crust.  The buns turned out perfect for dipping!  I will make again. I did decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 Tablespoons.

Excellent! They taste just like bakery rolls (and a GOOD bakery, not the lousy grocery store kind). I halved the recipe and used my bread machine's dough cycle to prepare the dough.  I had a hard time getting the rolls to double in size but I think that's because it's February in New England and the house is pretty cool. I did eventually get the dough balls to double in size and I baked them about 18 min.  They were a beautiful golden brown on the outside (skipped the egg white glaze) and soft and fluffy on the inside.  I found these kind of large for dinner rolls, so will make them smaller next time.  They will make excellent sandwich rolls too.  This is a keeper -easy and delicious!

These are perfection!  The crust was light and a little chewy when I baked in the oven for 14-15 min. and the inside was just heaven!  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, formed the rolls, and let rise for ~40 min.  I only baked them for about 14-15 minutes (did not use any egg wash, as I like these without).  For the bread machine, I just tossed the ingredients in this order: water, salt, oil, sugar, flour, then yeast.  You just can't go wrong with easy recipes like this one. I made 2 sandwich-sized and 10 dinnner-sized rolls that came out beautifully.  I froze all but one (to try warm!) when they were completely cool, and ate one at lunch today as a mini sandwich.  Now I only wish I made loaves instead because I can't wait to try it as French Toast, too.  I will definitely make this again- sooner rather than later!

The texture was great, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, but I found the flavor to be a bit lacking.  This recipe definitely needs to be tinkered with a little bit for more flavor.  We had them the first night as rolls with spaghetti and meatballs and they were OK.  We had the leftovers the next night with French Dip Sandwiches and once the bread soaked up the flavor from the au jus, they were fabulous!  Also, mine were done in only 14 minutes, so keep an eye on them!  Also, how in the world do you make them look nice??  I will definitely give this another try.

These had a really nice crust to it. I think next time I will just make as loaf of bread rather then rolls. I might notice the flavor and texture better this way.

These are really really REALLY good.  Only my second time ever baking bread.  So happy with the taste, texture, ease of baking, everything about this recipe is wonderful!  They even turned out pretty, which surprised me since I wasn't expecting them to be so ... uniform.  LOL  This one's going in my special recipe box and will be used over and over and over.  Can't wait to try it with some herbs in it, or as garlic bread!

These were okay. I replaced some of the water with milk to give the rolls a richer taste. Spongy texture.

My husband said this was the best bread he has ever had, and they are still very good the next day heated in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. Thank you, lots of fun watching them rise so much, my 4 year old helped me and we had a blast. Thank you :)

Great recipe.  I mixed the dough in the bread machine, then proceeded according to the recipe.  I though the texture was wonderful.  I put the extra rolls in the freezer and have been using them as needed.  They still smell wonderful after I've warmed them up in the microwave.

This recipe makes a great, versatile dinner roll. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. You could even use this bread to make mini hoagies. I made it to dip into Vidalia Onion Soup from this site.

These did not come out quite as good as I had hoped.  They were good, but kind of dense and too sweet to be real french bread.  I used olive oil and I like the flavor that it imparted.  Next time I am only going to use half the sugar and add a little bit more salt.  I doubled the recipe and made hogie rolls and 2 loaves of french bread.  Next time, I'll just stick to making rolls.

These rolls were relatively easy to make (I used a kitchenaid mixer to knead the dough).  Then I just shaped them and popped them into the oven.  Scrumptious!  Easy enough for my 3 year old to do.  I did not cover with a damp towel though, after reading the other reviews.  I just covered with a dry towel the 1st rise and didn't cover them the 2nd rise.  I also misted them with water before baking.  A very soft and chewy roll.

These are great!  I've made them for a sandwich buffet and for hot pork pulled meat sandwiches.  Yummy!  I don't do the egg wash as my kids don't like things too hard w/ their braces.  Great flavor.

This is an amazing recipe!  The rolls turned out lovely and we made bruschetta with it.  In fact, I'll be making these rolls for a Chicken Curry party - they'll go perfectly with the curry.  I'll never buy crusty rolls from the bakery again!

This is my family's favorite bread recipe.  I've baked in in small loaf pans, rolls, muffin tins, braided it for a pretty centerpiece, and I even make hamburger buns out of it!  It's so versitile and it has a fabulous flavor Especially with cinnamon and sugar.

I tried this recipe tonight to rave review from our dinner guest and my husband.
I found that I had to add 1/4 cup more water, as it seemed dry, and it worked perfectly.
My husband thought they were very professional, and store-bought. We are taking the rest to his moms tomorrow night for supper.

I let this rise three times, and I made one small baguette and 12 rolls. The rolls ended up looking just like the picture. I got them to look this way by pinching the edges under to make the tops of the rolls more round, and I used the egg wash suggested. They have a chewy crust. Thanks Jo!

These dinner rolls were really easy and tasted pretty good.  I used regular flour instead of bread flour which is why it might have been a little bland.  But everyone ate them!

WOW these are really to die for. My husband said they smelled and tasted just like the rolls his grandmother used to make. I used the bread machine and they came out perfect. My daughter reqested a batch for workers on her house to make "poor boy" sandwiches. I also used a scale to make the rolls an even size. I used 4 ounces last time and they were quite large. I will try 3 ounces this time. I did not punch down the dough when it came out of the machine, I just divided into balls and let rise again, light and fluffy inside. Thanks Jo for a easy wonderful recipe. Hi, back again. I have made these several times and have trouble with the rolling in balls and getting the uniform size. This last time I rolled the dough out until about 1" thick and used a 3" cutter (or a glass 3" round at top)look like biscuits, but turn out light and fluffy as before, just smaller and more even... PERFECT, thanks again.

Really good recipe! The taste of the bread was very good. I'm still having trouble with shaping. I served them with slow cooker french dip from this recipe and they tasted wonderful. But none of the rolls were the same size or very pretty to look at. I'd welcome any suggestions!

My husband said, "Oh my God, are these good!"  Nice and fluffy on the inside and gorgeous-looking outside.  Check them at ten minutes as mine were done perfectly at that time.  Use the egg white wash before baking for professional bakery looking rolls.

I tried this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit.  It was easy to make -- looked terrific and tasted even better.  I make bread a lot from fall to spring and definitely intend to make these again!

These weren't too bad, but not the best I'd ever had.  I felt they tasted too *yeasty*, maybe I will try again with a little less yeast.  They were nice and quick, and they were edible..just nothing special.

I'm so happy that I finally made bread that dosen't look and feel like a flour brick. These were the best. They tasted and looked like store bought. And that's a good thing. Two thumbs up on this one. Can't wait to make them again! Thanks Jo Catlin!

Solid recipe. Easy to make. But I don’t think it’s French. I made it twice and second time it needed more salt. You can make the crust crispy or soft. My whole family really enjoyed it. Will make again.

Very easy to make and stays fresh for a few days.  I did the egg wash on the top the first time and it made them nice and shiny.  Second time I left it off and threw ice cubes in to steam them at time of baking.  I didn't find that they got any crustier as per other peoples recommendations.

Easy recipe to use with my bread machine.  I made four large sandwich rolls and a small loaf of bread out of the dough.  It smells fantastic and came out of the oven exactly as expected.  Beautiful dough.

I don't have a stand mixer or bread machine.  Can I still make these using a hand mixer or by had stirring it?  This recipe looks awesome and I would like to make them this fall. Thank you for any suggestions on this.

Loved these.  Somewhere before a brioche roll in taste and texture.  Family raving about them.  Will look to add herbs and my own spin but the base recipe is great!

This is just a plain 'ol roll recipe.  The name of this recipe is deceiving, and sure to disappoint everyone looking to have the flavor of French bread in a roll form.    Nothing French about it, especially the taste.  In order to get the flavor of French bread into a roll, at least a portion of the dough must go through a long fermentation process.  This recipe doesn't even come close.  For an authentic flavor, start with a biga sponge or "poolish" and let it ferment at least overnight on your counter, or a couple of days in the refrigerator.   That is where the taste and texture of good, flavorful bread is developed.

I  replaced the sugar with a third of a cup of full cream powdered milk. This reduces your sugar intake a little but there’s still some sugar in the milk. Made two batches, one for rolls and one for a bread loaf using a 9 x 5 bread tin and forming two balls to fit the tin.
Saved the recipe.

Half the rolls came out looking like professionally made bread, but the other pan was not so good because the egg wash made them fall and those were more like biscuits. This recipe came out better than my other attempts at bread and is good for beginners, however, it tastes a little bland. I guess that's the trade-off for a simpler recipe that takes less time to develop.

I did exactly as the recipe asked in the Kitchen aid and they turned out wonderfully. I made 11 rolls. Different sizes. I think next time I shall make 8 like someone else said so that they can be used more for sandwiches or burger buns than for dinner rolls.

These are absolutely wonderful! I make a dozen from this recipe instead of the suggested 16, and they're the perfect size for burgers as well as a side for soup. They also make fabulous bunwiches! I have been experimenting, and stuffing them with keema or pepperoni and cheese. Works out fabulously! I will be using this recipe as my go-to for rolls from now on. Thanks for posting! (Oh, and BTW I used olive oil instead of veg because that's all I had, and it gives it a lovely flavour.)

These are so good and really not hard to make.  I have made them twice and plan to make them at least once a week.  I love them hot with honey and butter, but they are great too for sandwiches.

These are the best. I used my bread machine (dough setting) to do all the mixing and then popped them in the oven. I've made them many times, Very delicious.

Utterly delicious! The hit at our Thanksgiving meal. Prepare to wait a long time as there are two waiting periods before baking. Watch the oven close.

Absolute MUST to whisk one egg and brush the tops of the bread (I didn't have a brush and used a plastic spoon).

Great recipe! My 2 teenagers had it gone within minutes. I cheated and used my bread machine's dough cycle. I also divided them up so each would be large enough for bread bowls. Used an egg wash then a tad bit of butter and a pinch of salt. We will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

I made these rolls as garlic knots, and they were fantastic! The crust  is crunchy and the inside is soft. They made great garlic knots, and this will be my go-to recipe for future garlic knot preparation (Monday night pizza night, any time we have Italian food, when we eat Thanksgiving cause my family is just weir d that way.)

Absolutely amazing! My husband ran around our home, bun in hand, sing song yelling how lucky he is to have me :) So, a big thank you for this recipe. I used regular flour because that is all I had, and needed a little less than 3 and 1/2 cups. I let the KitchenAid do they kneading for 7 minutes :):) Divided into 8 buns for sandwiches and baked 18 minutes. Cooled on wire rack. Divine!

I made these 2 days ago to make roast beef sandwiches with and already have requests for another batch. 

I prepped the dough in my bread machine. The changes I made were olive oil, honey instead of sugar,  and because I had to wait to bake I formed the rolls and put the baking sheets in the fridge. 

I brushed water over the tops and switched the pans after 10 minutes of baking. 

Seriously delicious rolls. Thanks!

I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I only used 3 cups of flour and baked for 12 minutes. I was looking for a nice roll to go with a soup I had made and these are exceptional. By the time I got 3 cups of flour in, the dough was tacky but needed no flour on the counter. I'm pretty much old school, mixing and kneading by hand.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have any bread flour so I used regular all-purpose.  I didn't use an egg wash on top of the rolls before I baked them, either, but I definitly will next time. I put some ice cubes in a pan and placed it in the preheated oven when I put the rolls in to bake as suggested by another reviewer.  My Mom said the rolls were the best thing she had eaten in a long time.  I will absolutely be making them again.

These are pretty good but I would only make them again to eat immediately after baking. The taste is pretty decent, not salty or sweet, excellent consistency and look professional. My only question about these is about storage, I am not sure what is the best way to save these after baking, since it seem like they loose their sponginess and moisture. Will make again when having people over for dinner.

I used what I had on hand which is to say, all purpose flour.  I only needed 3 1/2 cups.  Used my bread machine.  I always proof my yeast by using hot tap water and adding the sugar and oil to it, mixing, then adding the rapid yeast and putting it in the oven, with the light on for about 10 or 15 minutes.  If its got foam its good.  I then put it in my machine,  then the flour and lastly the salt press dough setting and your good to go.  Followed the rest of the instructions, buttered the t   op and sprinkled on sesame seeds.  Ended up baking about 22 minutes.  I did not grease the sheet.  I used a silpat or you could probably just use parchment paper.  Usually I have a problem with the buns spreading out.  This time they didn't.

Good texture but a little bland. Have to look for something I can add in.

These are super easy and yummy! I cut the recipe in half as it’s only 3 of us. The only thing I did a little different is I cooked them in my cast iron pan and heavily oiled it. I also egg washed the buns once before putting in the oven then a 2nd coat 10min in. This is my go to recipe

I've used this recipe 4-5 times now.  This makes great bread! I have made rolls and also made 4 small baguettes with it.  I add a little extra yeast to make it a bit lighter.  Also works well to substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also add a bit of rosemary and it tastes amazing.

A basic, standard, white, crusty dinner roll that is good to eat with soups, etc.  Anyway, that's the reason I chose this recipe.  I would make this one again...for the same purpose.  I plan to give these to my father-in-law as part of his birthday food gifts along with 3 types of soups.

Wonderful bread! And so easy, too. I typically don't review unless I follow the recipe exactly but.... this one gets five stars for turning out even though I messed it up a bit! I only had a package of quick rise yeast that was three months expired, all purpose flour and aI accidentally added too much oil! But the bread was still light, fluffy and so good! We ate half last night and the other half is in the freezer.
I have another batch in the oven today. And I may make more tomorrow and see how it does as a pizza crust!

Followed the recipe with no changes. The rolls are crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Very bland though, but I will definitely make this again and will add honey as recommended by another reviewer.

In a bread machine , I used the exact ingredient listed . However , I make bread bread so much (kinda obsessed) that I knew I could skip the step of rising dough ball in a greased bowl & move on to deflating the dough when cycle was finished , shape into small French loaves ( to make sandwiches for my husbands lunch ) i placed uncovered on a large greased pan in oven with light on . This took APROX  40 min & then baled at 400 * for 15 min THAT WAS PERFECT !

I don't do a lot of bread-baking, but this was quite easy to make and had great results. I followed the directions as written, but I let them bake in prepared muffin tins. They baked up nice and round. I let them bake for 20 min, but next time I'll try 18 and see what difference it makes.

Instead of dividing into rolls I split the dough in half and made 2 loaves. Brushed with egg white and sprinkled one with sesame and the other with poppy seed. Only used about 3cups of flour. Perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside.

A couple of others have made various comments I agree with, so in summary:-

Very tasty bread, the rolls come out light and fluffy, amazing with just real butter melted into it. Also made a lovely garlic flatbread with the dough. Next is a Pizza from this dough. 

I do have to say though that the cooking time is slightly excessive.

I think the secret is mixing half of the flour first. These turned out beautifully and perfectly brown. I just followed the directions exactly and they turned out great. Will be making these more often.

Don't understand why so many people give it such good reviews. I don't think they tastes all that great. They are ok, nice texture but the taste is very bland... will be good for a sandwich, or if you put butter or something else on them. But over all it's good basic recipe, very easy and quick to make. I will try them again but will add some flavor, may be cheese...

I made this recipe 1 time. It was a success at my daughters Thanksgiving Dinner. Everyone enjoyed the rolls. They were a great addition to her Turkey, Dressing, and sweet potato casserole.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe. I made this in my bread machine using the dough cycle.  It turned out amazing.   Thank you!  Yummy!

This was an easy recipe to follow and made delicious rolls. The only think I did differently was make the rolls smaller and cook 13-15 minutes at 400 degrees. I used egg wash and topped half with poppy seeds. This made about 32 small rolls rather than 16 large rolls.

Good, consistent recipe. Made rolls and pizza dough. Found I needed a temp of 375. Wouldn't call it to die for lol. But it's a good go to with readily available ingredients. Thank you!

I made this and didn’t have any substitutions besides adding more flour as I needed. It was way too sticky. But it turned out great.

I am a first timer baking and this recipe was easy to follow and they came out wonderful. I already ate 5 of them and my kids are not from school yet. Will they make it until thump thump thuuuuuuummp. Very wonderful and made me happy. Now i have to make more in a few days. Great video also. made it even more simple. I used all purpose flour and just had to add extra flour. I used common sense. OMG THEY ARE DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is so simple to make! I've made 3 batches already within the past 2 days. They don't last. I've made one batch into sourdough rolls by letting the dough rise longer. Both ways were delicious. I love these rolls and they are great with sandwiches and fresh out of the oven with butter! Thank you so much for this perfect recipe!

Alright, beginner bread makers, can I give you some advice!

for those of you who are not used to bake bread all from scratch, there are a few things you should know. 

First of all , water temperature is very important for the yeast to work. If it's  too hot the dough will not rise, the yeast will die instead.
 If it's too cold, the yeast wont get activated. So stick with 110 degree like the video suggest.

Also, adding flour can be tricky. My mom always taught me to NOT add flower cup by cup in to the dough,  because you could end up adding too much flour which will result in hard  and dense rolls.  I know this recipe calls for a certain amount of flour,  but that still varies slightly from batch to batch. Just like anything you bake or cook I guess.

I added in the first 2 cups like she said, then I added just enough flower for the dough to start taking shape, but NOT  to the point  it completely separated from the bowl. It was still a little sticky...Next,  I flowered the work area and emptied the dough mixture on to it,  and then I worked the remaining flower in by hand. Just enough to make the dough just right, like in the video.  I even ended up with 1/4 cup flower I didn't use.
Next thing , also important. When you rise your rolls/dough, very important to keep it in a draft free, somewhat warmer area and cover it with a cloth, kitchen towel. If it's too cold drafty, the rolls will not rise.
Last, cooking time varies.  Do not leave them in too long because they will be

These were easy to make and came out looking great, but are way too sweet for my taste.  Will cut the sugar in half next time; as written these don't taste like French bread.  Rather they taste like American dinner rolls.

I made these to go with beef stew. I used unbleached flour because I didn't have bread flour. I also used olive oil but I think next time I might use corn oil. Everybody loved them. I only baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect.

These were so easy to make and they turned out FABULOUS! I left half the batch a little larger to use as sandwich rolls the next day.  They didn't need more than 15 minutes, but the tray I left in a little longer than I should've (oops!), they turned out crunchier on the outside, but still fantastically soft and light on the inside. The only thing I did differently than indicated in the recipe was to brush the tops with egg wash and butter.

Oh. My. God. This is THE best bread I have EVER made in my life!!! First time ever! It was white and fluffy and sooo soft. It even beats the bread machine I had(SKG brand). Hands-down, a keeper!

I used instant yeast, so I skipped the first step and mixed all the dry ingredients together, then added the liquids. I ended up using more flour than stated as the dough was way too sticky. It rose quite fast(it IS instant yeast after all) and baked beautifully! I didn't use bread flour, maybe that would've given it extra bread fragrance. THANK YOU so much for this recipe! I couldn't get over how perfect it was!

I'm terrible with making bread, but this worked out great. My boys in particular loved them, and the chew was nice, even here in Hawaii where the humidity and elevation tends to screw around with bread making!

I really enjoy this bread. I use this recipe to make large bread bowls instead of smaller french rolls. I usually end up using only 3.5 c flour and often sub butter for the oil. Comes out great and works amazing with soups and chili.

These were perfect. I ran out of bread flour near the end, so I used about 3/4 C of AP.  I washed the tops with the egg white and water wash and it gave them a nice semi gloss finish. The crust was was a nice shell - not too hard and not too soft, chewy. The insides tasted like french bread I've bought at the store. I will use this often.

I just want to say thank you.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I noticed a few reviews that talk about too much flour in the recipe.  I learned something new and it was very helpful.  If you use 4 cups of properly measured flour, it's perfect for these buns.  What does that mean?  DON'T SCOOP YOUR FLOUR.  Use a spoon or whatever, and place the flour into the measuring cup that way.  If you scoop directly into the measuring cup, you will get too much.  Test this for yourself.  I was sceptical till I tried it, and it seemed to work.  Anyway, I also used honey instead of white sugar, doubled the salt, and made 8 buns for hambuger/sandwich sized. This will be a go to for me!

Keep in mind this is a bread recipe and a lot of the time measuring by volume yield different results. I used a tablespoon of honey in the first step. In the second step I kept the salt and oil ratio the same but only used about 3 and a 1/4 cups flour. Dough was a little sticky but kneading it into extra flour I had a nice elastic dough in about 8-10 minutes. Right now it's rising in the oven we'll see.

Making bread is pretty labor intensive, and this recipe was no different.  I thought the result was good, but not incredible for all of the effort. Keep in mind I'm not a great cook, so my result could be very different than that from someone who knows what they're doing ;)

This was a total failure at first. I made this about a month ago with 5 cups of wheat flour and it failed so badly. The dough was really wet, I thought it was fine, but after making other recipes, I found out that it really isn't. I just went through the recipe and did everything without kneading. I baked it and it tasted fine, but it was really flat due to the wetness of the dough. A while ago, I just finished mixing all of the ingredients and I tell you, 4 cups of flour is BS. 4 cups of flour is barely any thicker than my oatmeal. I added around 6 cups of flour and it wasn't even possible to handle it! It was still too sticky! I added more until it was less sticky and I could knead it. I wouldn't be surprised if I added a total of 7 cups of flour to my dough. Finally, I started kneading it and I actually needed to add a tablespoon of flour onto my board every 8 folds because that's just how sticky it is even with 7 cups of flour. Now, I let it rise for 10 minutes and it almost doubled in size! I put it in the fridge to rise slowly. I'll bake it tomorrow so wish me luck. EDIT: It was a total failure again. Although I also made a mistake by putting water in the oven causing it to not brown. I baked it for 20 minutes and its crust was hard. Really hard. I can't eat it. This recipe was a total failure for me.

I made this in my Kitchenaid mixer and added some garlic powder to make garlic bread rolls to go with spaghetti, and they were super yummy!  Easy to make, easy to clean up, and half the dough went in the freezer for next time. May never go back to store bought garlic bread!

First recipe that hasn't turned out dry for me!  The family loved them and has snacked on the left overs throughout the day.  I ran some melted butter with garlic over them dress out of the oven and stored in a ziplock overnight - I think they were better the second day!

I followed the recipe using 3 cups flour after reading the reviews, made  all by hand & am amazed how good these came out. The recipe is easy to follow and my rolls came out just right; crispy outside and delicious inside, fluffy not doughy.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times, with every time turning out perfect. I've use this to make long loaves of French bread, dinner rolls, and even hamburger buns. I use the recipe exactly as stated, I use my bread machine to do all of the kneading and rise cycles. I allow the dough to rise twice before making whatever shape and sizes I want.

Fantastic roll recipe. Followed as is except made 12 rolls instead of 16. Based on a lot of reviews stating that 16 was too small. If you are looking for a dinner roll stick to 16 if looking for a sandwich roll make 12. This will definitely be my go to roll recipe. Loved it!

I didn't change a thing.  These rolls are the best!  Nice crusty top and soft on the inside.  Perfect density.  Made a big pot of soup and served these rolls on the side.  My hubby couldn't stop raving about them.  I think I will just stop buying bread altogether and just make these every week.  Great for bunwiches at lunch too.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Didn't make any changes and I will certainly make them again. Superb and easy for me to knead even with my uncooperative hands. Thanks. Oh wish other people would mention the quantity a recipe makes, it would make trying them easier.

These turned out light and fluffy. I do wish that they had just a bit more taste though. I'll make them again and use a little more salt next time. 

**I used the dough hook on my artisan mixer, and the dough was smooth at 3 1/2 cups, as most users have noted.

*I did not knead on a floured surface because this adds more flour than needed. To avoid the dough sticking to your hands, coat your hands in a little bit of oil first- this also helps add more smoothness to the dough.

I also never use a moist towel- I lightly rub the top of the dough with olive oil to keep it from drying out, and then cover with a clean, dry hand towel- and I repeat this once the dough is balled. (Laundry day is the perfect time to bake bread, btw- proof your bread in the laundry room while the dryer is running)

All in all, the recipe itself is pretty good- but the instructions needed a bit of adjusting to make it work for me.

(Personal notes: Used 2tbs yeast, Olive oil and 2tsp salt for better flavor)

Extremely easy recipe and the end product is beautiful and taste amazing. These quickly became a favorite in my home. I make them without a mixer. Can't attest to the next day because we have a big family and they all go in one sitting.

I used a bread maker for the dough after mixing the yeast and sugar, then added the egg white glaze before baking, and the buns turned out perfect.  I am very happy with the results.

Made this 4X.  Every time I use 2.5-3 cups of flour.  If you use 4 you'll chew on very dry bread.  This is a great recipe! Love these rolls every single time. Finger licking good! Top with egg white 3-5 minutes before finished and these will look like Logan Steakhouse rolls but tastes even better!  YUMMY

Nice recipe to work with, although I would flour the tops of the rolls to rise, as they adhered to the towel and needed a third rise uncovered before I put them in the oven

Didn't really come out, I used instant yeast so that could be why because the bread came out hard instead of soft the way bread should and it didn't rise very well. I'll try again with the active yeast and write another review after I try it. Hopefully it turns out this time.

I followed the recipe but putting the wet cloth over the buns will stick to the bread. I baked them after letting them sit for 20 minutes and they came out just fine.

I've made these rolls twice now, and, just today, was asked to make them for a Christmas pot luck.  The rolls have great flavor, and are easy to make in my stand mixer.  I made no changes to the ingredients.  I did put a 1/8 inch slice in each roll before baking just to give them a classic French bread appearance. Great recipe. Thank you.

First of all, the description is wrong.  I believe these would be more accurately described as soft white bread rolls, which is what I was aiming for.  I only baked for 13-15 mins as I could see they were golden brown and was afraid they would get too hard.  Perhaps the full 18-20 mins would have produced a more French bread consistency with a crunchy crust?  

Anyway, these turned out okay but were awfully bland.  I will make again but double the salt, and possibly add more sugar.  And experiment with a 425 baking temp as with a box roll that I've had success with in the past.

I made these rolls more french bread like. First, instead of round rolls, I formed the dough into baguette shapes, with about an inch between the rolls, then I raised them the last 40 minutes. I put a pan of hot water on the shelf below the rolls, and sprayed water on the rolls before they went into the oven. Then, is sprayed the rolls again at the five minute mark, with an extra spritz for the oven as I closed the door. That gets the humidity immediately back up. Then I sprayed again in ten minutes at the 15 minute mark. Back into the oven for another 3-5 minutes. You have to add a little time due to opening the oven door and spraying cold water into the oven. They turned out nicely crusty and chewy, just like french bread should be.

Everything went fine with making these.  No problems with sticking or rising.   They looked great but the taste was really bland when eating them fresh out of the oven.  But the next day they were so much better. I would have thought eating them hot and fresh would have been best but for me they tasted better the next day cold.

For the second rising you must not put a damp towel on the rolls, because it sticks to the rolls..

I LOVE these rolls!!! I make them (usually a bit larger) and use them for warm Italian sandwiches. Every person I make them for loves them and say that the toll makes the sandwich. I totally agree. Whether for a sandwich or "just" as a roll, these are phenomenal!!!

I just took mine out of the oven a few minutes ago. They turned out beautifully. Thank you for such an amazing recipe. Next time I will definitely double the recipe- it's that good and I don't anticipate having left overs from this batch. Thanks again :)

These rolls were okay. They were rather plain, so increase the salt and make sure to serve with jam and butter. I tried to eat it plain, but it wasn't as appetising without butter. They taste nothing like a French roll. It's quite easy to make, but it will not be my first choice recipe for a roll. Healthy, looks good, and has a good texture... But taste? Not so much.

I've made the recipe twice, with brand new yeast the second time, and both times the dough didn't rise at all during the second session. And I had a major problem getting the towel off the dough. It sticks pretty badly, whether you use a towel or a paper towel. So the rolls are more like flatbread, but they taste good!

I wonder what would happen if next time I skipped the second rise...

I wanted beef dip for dinner, but nobody wanted to go into town to get buns, so I found this recipe. 
It was, as advertised, very easy and quick and very tasty. I did end up baking them for about 13 minutes, and they were perfect.
I only changed the the oil for olive oil, but no other changes were necessary

This was a great recipe and very easy to follow ! I also glazed them using the egg white / water note up top . The rolls are amazing . However I used virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil . No bread machines here . All by hand and it turned out wonderful. Im keeping this one in my recipe book. Thanks!

This exceeded my expectations.  Only my second time making bread and it turned out phenomenal.  Just like you buy but now I can experiment with add ins.  I had to use all purpose flour but no matter.  I  was careful with the oven temp and time but otherwise no changes.  Thank you!

Good simple recipe.  The other reviews are right...You need to steam bake these to give the "French" texture and the cook time is off.  Mine were done at the 15 minute mark.   I also made a batch of 50% whole wheat buns too. You just substitute 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour for each 1 cup of white flour you want to replace. So I ended up using 2 cups white and 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat. The reason that you shouldn't do a 1 to 1 substitution is because the W.W.F. absorbs more water.  Also with whole wheat you need to cook them slower and at a lower temp. I did 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Please note: Don't use more than 50 whole wheat flour or your gonna have a bad time ;)

I am a huge fan of french bread, and these definitely taste just like it. The outside is fairly crunchy while the inside is soft. Just like french bread, they came out pretty stiff the next day. I used my KitchenAid mixer for all mixing and kneading. Pretty easy with minimal ingredients. I will probably try this recipe to make a whole loaf of french bread.

I'm not sure if it's because I live at a higher elevation, or what the problem could be, but I've tried this two times now and because the dough is so incredibly sticky and never really comes together for me like it should.

Good easy roll.  I went with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sourdough starter.  Still came out light and fluffy.  Also added 1 large tbsp. of shortening.  It helps keep the rolls moist.

I made this for the first time yesterday.  They were great.  They were done before I was ready for dinner, so when I was ready to eat, I just put  a few back in the oven to heat up and they turned nice and crispy also.  Such an easy recipe and so good.  I did mix the water, yeast and sugar and let it sit, than added the oil and salt and stirred them together.  After that I put it in the bread machine, added about 3 1/2 cups of flour and put it on the dough cycle.  It did great.  It was sticky, but just add more flour on a board and it was fine.  Am going to make more today as I gave my daughter 12 of the rolls for her family.

They were denser than I was hoping for.  The dough rose beautifully, so I was excited.  I agree with the person who said this would be a nice loaf recipe.

Followed some reviewers suggestions and only baked for 10-12 minutes. These turned out extremely soft and fluffy. Almost too soft really, but the flavor is pretty spot on. I definitely suggest an egg wash before baking; it takes this bread to the next level.

What I loved about this recipe, apart from the fact that it is so easy to make, is that it uses only basic everyday ingredients ... no rushing to the store for molasses or some fancy seed or flour type .... just basic stuff thats in just about everyones cupboard. Plus ... they taste just great while still warm, with real butter .... and the smell in the house is just divine. Whats not to love :)

These are amazing. I used all purpose flour. Made 8 instead of 16. Will definitely make again.

Made the recipe as directed. The only thing I did different was brush the tops with egg wash. They were delicious. Going to try them again without the egg wash.

I did it! I made bread from scratch. I feel like a domestic superhero! I followed the recipe procedures nearly exactly. The only modification I made was to make 8 large rolls instead of 16 smaller ones. These are pretty good and I hope to start making them frequently.  I took one poster's advice and threw some ice cubes in the over to get my rolls to be crispy on the outside and it did seem to work.

This is THE recipe for bread rolls. I made them smaller in the past, not a huge hit...but once I made 12 large rolls, the family voted those the best rolls ever (Same recipe!! Puzzles me but whatever, I bake what they like). I have also done light egg wash and sesame seeds for a hamburger bun-type roll. This recipe is perfect & easy. I'd just suggest making 12 fat rolls, as, for whatever reason, everyone likes the larger size. Maybe the texture is better.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!

I made these on whim to go with my chicken soup.  These turned out absolutely perfect and delicious.  Since I had the time, I made them by hand.  It was very easy as everything went along just as the recipe stated.  The only thing I watched for, that differed from the recipe, was how long I baked it for.  Another reviewer said it should be baked for less time, so I put the rolls in the oven for 14 minutes and checked it a few minutes prior to that and they were ready.  I also spritzed them with water as another reviewer stated..not sure if that had any effect or not!  This recipe is 5 stars because if you follow it (accept less time in oven) you will have very good rolls for your meal!

Actually my kids (7 and 5yrs old) made this. They were great, the prep time was good but the waiting was way too long. Kids were very patient, momma was not. But they were a hit! Will definitely make this again, but this time we will start the process early.

added wheat for diet requirements and oregano 1 tsp for flavour.. turned out delicious.. before the last "prove" i rolled it into one very long roll and cut into 14 pieces, then rolled each piece into a circle then powdered with flour to keep from being too sticky,  once ready to I oiled them and added salt on top with oregano then let it "prove" then into oven..

Crunchy outside and soft doughy insides made these a hit. My first batch came out a little chewy due to my lack of kneading experience but I got it down for the second batch and they came out perfect. Instead of cutting individual rolls out of a ball I rolled the dough out into a tube and cut off sections, I found it easier to keep the rolls a consistent size and shape that way. I did add about a tsp more salt than the recipe called for, but besides that I think I will make them just the same next time

This is a great, easy recipe as is. I made it, as written and the only negative comment is that it lacks flavor. So I made it a second time with some personal modifications, an imported premium yeast, increased the salt and sugar slightly, used a Milanese Gremolata olive oil, and added a very small amount of oat flour.Then I did  slow 8 hour rise in the refrigerator X 2. It made a tastier bread, that suited my family's tastes. This is a keeper!!!!

Very good, made this last night in my new bread machine on dough cycle.  Added a little vital gluten (~2 tsp), and added more water as it was kneading as it seemed dry.  Shaped 4 large baguettes, egg wash on top, ice cubes in bowl in bottom of oven.  Texture is not exactly French bread--doesn't have the big holes, it is more dense (because of the fat).  But DH and I really liked it.  We ate most of one baguette with Italian sausage and kale pasta, I'll put the other 3 in the freezer as suggested in another review, and try it later in the week.  I think it would make really nice croutons, too.

This recipe was awesome! Like the others, I only needed 3 1/2 cups of flour. I coated the dough with an egg white and honey before popping it in the oven. My BF ate 5 rolls in one sitting. Will be using this recipe again.

I love, love, love this recipe! I thought bread/roll making was so difficult and such a mystery. This recipe is easy and fast but SO delicious. The only problem is that now we're spoiled and want these rather than packaged breads or rolls!

I never buy bread flour. Due to me never baking bread. I had a packet of yeast left over from a recipe I made the day before. Found this recipe used all purpose flour instead. Still turned out amazing and very easy to do.

Made this a couple times now and it truly is unbelievably easy. I've made lots of different kinds of breads but this is light and fluffy on the inside and good crust on the outside. I will be making this bread a lot. I ran out of bread flour so I just added a 1 1/2 tbs of baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt per cup of ap flour.

Perfect, even without the egg whites the crust was crisp.  I put poppy seeds on them and they are perfect!  Easy straight forward recipe.

Tried this recipe for the first time today. I'm making it to go with bean with ham soup so wanted a stronger flavored roll. I replaced 3 cups of the bread flour with 2 cups dark rye flour and 1 cup whole wheat with 1 cup white bread flour. I also added a teaspoon of non diastatic malt powder. Rolled into 12 rolls, brushed with water and sprinkled with caraway seeds.  They turned out beautifully! Great texture and flavor!

Turned out pretty well. TThe outer shell was nice and cruncy and the inner bread was soft and spongy just how I expected. I only cooked mine for 15 minutes (18 had them burning), and afterwards I rubbed some butter over the tops to give them that glazed look and a nice buttery flavor. My family approves!

Basic recipe for a basic roll- not really French rolls as they would need to have a thicker, more crunchy crust (cue the water spray). These rolls would be a good support to some sort of topping as the bread itself is rather bland and not much of the "chew" texture you would anticipate for French bread. Very easy to make and would be a good recipe for a someone new to yeast breads to try

I made these in the bread machine on the dough cycle and after they went through the first rise I cut the dough into 12 pieces and put in large muffin tins.  Let rise again and bake.  Mmmmm good!  They are so easy and I froze in small batches so that I could take them out, wrap in foil and warm in the oven.  Tasted just as fresh as the first day.  They are simple and light tasting.  So yummy!!

I love buns.  This is a basic white bread recipe.  Very easy and good.  I followed the directions to the letter, which I won't do again.  The damp towels stick to the buns.  I thought maybe there was a reason for using the damp cloth, I don't think so.  Next time I'll do my usual.  Lightly spray plastic wrap with pam and cover the buns.  No sticking.  Happy baking everybody.

This is an awesome roll recipe as it is. But I use cheese whey from making feta instead of water and garlic salt instead of regular salt, and it makes phenomenal rolls. Using the bread machine to just do the dough and let them rise makes them extra fluffy, but don't do more than 1½ the recipe or it will make a big mess! (:
My grandmother in law has the family roll recipe and my husband even prefers these rolls over hers!

This recipe read like a wallpaper paste recipe.  I saw the great reviews and gave it a shot.  I was right.  Rolls that taste like wallpaper paste.  YUCK!!  I am a baker and I was very disappointed and embarrassed to serve them.

These are so yummy!!!! The only thing differently I did was put the sugar, yeast and water in the oven on 170 degrees for 10 minutes, so it fermented. Amazing, can't wait to try it with the bbq pulled chicken.

These buns turned out delicious!!! I made much smaller buns for mini sandwiches and stuffed them with dressing lettuce olives and cold cuts, everybody loved them! Also after brushing them with egg white I added some sesame and black seeds which gave them a more professional look and enhanced the flavour

This recipe is to die for!  I did make one change by mistake - I added a tablespoon of baking powder to the first 2 cups of flour simply because I started to make a different recipe but found I didn't have all the needed ingredients.  Other than that I made this exactly as written and these rolls were the lightest, fluffiest dinner rolls I've ever made.  Excellent recipe and one that will be part of my weekly baking routine

I did not have Bread Flour so I had to use about 1/2 cup extra of White Flour (didn't have unbleached flour on hand either).  Just eyeball it and you'll know when you added enough.  They have a bland taste, which I expected since the dough itself was bland, but adding taste via a good spread made these great!  I preferred marscapone over butter but the family devoured the honey butter.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Made exactly as directed, but using a bread machine dough cycle for the first part.  My machine states to add all liquids, then to add solids. I add the yeast to the liquid as the first solid, then the flour, etc., then the salt as the last solid, in order to encourage the yeast action.  After the dough cycle completed, I put the dough in a greased bowl, following the directions from that step onward.  The result was rolls that were crisp on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.  In our household we use these for a nice side with soup, for sandwiches, and as cheese toast.  Everyone that tastes them agrees that the recipe is a winner.

Great recipe!  I will definitely make this again! But as usual I can't keep from adding or changing something in a recipe.  I made a 1/2 recipe this time but next time I will make the full recipe and freeze 1/2 for pizza dough.
1. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
2. I Grated one glove of fresh garlic into the dough and chopped 2-3 cloves of roasted garlic I had in the fridge(would have only the roasted but I didn't remember I had it until after mixing in the fresh), while mixing in my Kitchen Aide.  It did all the kneading.
3. After forming the rolls I brushed them with more olive oil and sprinkled them with sea salt.
Sorry friends of mine but my dough was not all that sticky to work with, I have no idea why.  And oh yes, I use AP flour.

These are so easy and taste wonderful. Next time will shape into ovals and use for sandwiches as someone else suggested. Good with honey butter on them.

These are terrific! I made them in my bread machine on the dough cycle and used one cup of ww flour along with 3 cups bread flour. Other than that, no substitutions.

Very very sticky but easy to make. Made them into bun size to use for leftover BBQ pork and sweet and sour chicken today. Held together pretty well but if I make this again def gonna try making them into rolls instead.

Wonderful.  I did not have any bread flour on hand so I used all purpose flour and they turned out perfect.  I also used canola oil for the oil.  I baked them at 400 degrees to an internal temperature of 195 degrees, probably a bit less than 18 minutes.   If you can invest in an instant thermometer, I would really recommend it. This type of yeast bread should be baked to 190 to 200 degrees. I brushed butter on after they were baked which made the crust soft and chewy, which is how we like our rolls, and it also gave them a pretty sheen.  I am going to teach my daughter how to make rolls using this recipe because the dough is so easy to work with.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

not for bread machine users! I checked the dough on the off chance and though id followed the recipe correctly, all there was, was a very sticky mess! a lot of flour, and a bigger mess later, I managed to salvage some dough and make some rolls, which were ok, but definitely not worth all the effort :( this wasn't my first time, I make French bread dough and oven bake it regularly, as rols or in a 2lb loaf tin....I wont be trying this again though.

TThis rises WAY too much for a machine. Then, if you can get it out, forget ever getting it off of the counter, your hands, anything that touches it. IT WILL NEVER LET YOU GO. I have never, NEVER, worked with such a ridiculously sticky dough. It probably needed twice as much flour for that to work (and yes, I added quite a bit more, but it never was enough). I literally had dough gloves by the time I gave up. STAY AWAY BREAD MACHINE DOUGH users. 

Now since I only have experience with this on the supposed fact that it can be used in the dough setting on the bread machine, I have no idea how it works with a stand mixer as in the video and a more hands on customized approach. But under no circumstances is it a "dump and let it go" recipe for the bread machine's dough setting. Given the reviews it's probably great. I'll never know.

This was a very good recipe! Mine turned out a little less crispy on the outside than I would have hoped for but I believe it was because of an error on my part. I will definitely try to make it again!

I got a kitchen-aid mixer for Christmas, and these were the first yeast rolls I ever made. Easy and fun to make, and the dough was very forgiving. Before baking, I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. Very yummy!

Made these rolls in my Zojirushi bread maker -!they were excellent, and I loved the chewy crust.   I had no issues with the cook time or temp - I made 12 rolls and cooked them on a silicon mat.

The rolls were OK. Did not do anything different. Wanted to try as is. I do a lot of home baking. Wanted to see if these would be really good.  Not much flavor. Will not try this one again.

I followed it to the letter but I put everything in my bread machine and selected the "dough" setting. Then turned it out and baked it in 4 small loafs. It came out fantastic, I highly recommend this recipe.

I thought these were good. Not exactly to die for but easy to make. No problems with it. Was a little hesitant to try these at first based on some of the reviews. I am still a novice baker. Glad i tried these though.  I halved the recipe and i used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. For those who didn't like this recipe, well... really, it's not the recipe ;)

These were wonderful! I was worried at first when they did not seem to rise as much as other breads I have made, but they turned out great. They were actually some of the best bread I have ever made. I did throw maybe a 1/4 of a tsp more of yeast in the mix and a couple dribbles of water into the dough. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. I might try these with a sourdough starter next time. They were dense and would taste awesome as a sourdough.

This was my first time making bread...and I could never be happier with the outcome.

The only things I changed was the process to create an artisan loaf...as opposed to rolls.

I followed the original recipe and these were bland.  We had to slather them with butter to make them worth eating.  I will add extra salt next time and see how they turn out then.

very tasty rolls. this was my first time making bread rolls and let me tell you, i was a bit nervous. what if the bread burns? what if the dough doesn't come out the way it's supposed to? what they become too dry on the inside? rest assured i found that after buttered and cooled for a few minutes they became crunchy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. i will try this recipe again only in smaller quantities or maybe one giant bread loaf for sandwiches, etc. i recommend this recipe for first timers.

Like others I've have decreased sugar to 1 TBSP. I used about 4 cups of the flour I would say.  It's very humid where I am at this time of the year, so I am cautious. I've pretty much follow the recipe as written. I wanted to agree with a few others on the negative critics that were given. Common sense is a must in baking bread, please do not blame the person that has gifted this awesome recipe. Cannot thank you enough JOCATLIN, it was easy and fun and gnummo!!!! My son just came home and stole a bun and made a sandwich...He said it was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside and tasted great.

These were good, but not exactly french rolls.  Not crusty enough or as airy as real french rolls.  They are easy and nice dinner rolls, but not to die for french rolls.  I didn't alter/adjust the recipe.

I tried to make this twice and I follow the recipe exactly and while good, I just can't get it perfect. My husband didn't care for the bread at all, but he's super picky.

Family loved it!  The timing to me was spot on, tried 12 minutes but rolls weren't brown. Added 6 more minutes and barely started to turn so added 2 min more and they were perfect. 20 min was the perfect time.  However the shape of my rolls were not consistent haha need practice first time french bread maker. this recipe was a great hit and addition to my recipe box.  Thank you JOCATLIN  FROM MAMA ODIE.

Love it. I've made it a couple of times and it was gone by the time I took it out of the oven. Next time I'll double the dose. Very nice texture. Crispy on the outside soft in the middle. Thank you for sharing.

These are perfect. My husband jokingly called them "roll models." I have never made rolls before and these look like they belong in a magazine. I topped them with a little garlic and salt and immediately gained twelve pounds. Just gorgeous.

This is just great!! I followed some suggested reviews of spraying cold mist on the rolls while they are baking at the initial stage for a crisp crust and I made it into 8 rolls instead of 16. I added another 3/4 teaspoon of salt. This is the first time I'm making bread in my entire life and they are delicious when you stuff fresh butterhead, tomato, cucumber and half melted cheddar cheese. Thank you so much for the recipe!

These rolls turned out wonderfully. They looked like they'd just come from the bakery. I prepared the dough in my bread machine. I doubled the size of the rolls as they were for sandwiches and baked them at 375 for 25 minutes. After reading reviews here, I did slightly cut back on the sugar and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Oh also, I read too late about the dough being very sticky, which it was. I can't stand handling sticky dough so I added more flour once I tipped it out of the bread machine, the rolls were still absolutely perfect.

Absolutely delicious!! made exactly per directions, very flavorful. I think I may have let it rise a little too long though as it was a little on the light and airy side. No complaints, my error. I think next time I wont let rise quit as long. I followed directions to the letter, even on rising time and everything. 4-cups flour ect.ect...did the egg wash, they came out looking fantastic!!! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again, and again

I followed it exactly and used my bread machine in the recipe. My family likes semi-sweet french bread. The only change that I did make was I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Not bad at all and quite easy, but the name would lead you to believe they are something exceptional and they aren't.  They are just fairly good.  Probably worthwhile, esp. for someone like me who is no expert bread baker.

They were fairly easy to make & tasted all right, but the oven temperature of 400 degrees was way too high. Luckily, I set the timer for 10 minutes & they were still burned a little on the bottom.

I have made these rolls at least 50 times now and they are fabulous.  Only amendment I have made is reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon as 2 is too sweet for French bread.  In summer when it is very dry and low humidity I need to increase the water slightly as all of our ingredients dry out.  Having been a regular buyer of French bread in France I would say this is very close to the texture and the inside is so soft and fluffy.  Freezes very well and keeps in plastic bag for 24-36 hours which is better than shop bought French bread.  Great recipe.  Cook for 15 mins in fan oven.

These buns are terrific and the recipe is great the way it is!  The only reason it didnt get 5 stars from me is I find they go stale very quickly (2 days maximum).  I have made them a couple times now and will continue to make them fresh when I want them.  They are great for pulled pork sandwiches...just the right amount of chew.

Wow...can't believe how easy this recipe is and they were so good! I followed the instructions of other reviews who, like me, don't have a bread machine. This will be a standard recipe on our house.

SUPER! I make the dough on Sunday's, divide and bake on need.  My family and friends love the smell of our home.  I'm a hacker cook, so they are supremely impressed, and I'm equally happy to oblige.  This is a regular.

These delicious pan rolls turned out awesome. I had no eggs but brushed them with butter , which made for a softer crust and everyone loved them.
Thanks for this quick & easy recipe!!

This was a very good recipe! we really enjoyed it and I would make it again. The only problem I had with it is that was not a true french bread, it didnt have the right texture and slight crunch, I am going to keep looking for a true french bread recipe but I would deffinately make this again for just regular rolls.

These were just okay. I found them rather bland, so next time I would follow another review's suggestion to add honey when proofing the yeast. They are just plain white buns so I'd probably try another recipe next time (and yes, the dough did rise and I followed recipe to a tee). Just too bland for my liking, plus I'm used to a multigrain taste.

My family loves these rolls.  I omit the salt because my dad has sodium restrictions, and they're still wonderful.  My (very picky) husband can't get enough.

Made these into submarine style rolls to put sausages in. SO GOOD! I brushed them with olive oil before going in.. wouldn't recommend that if you are looking for pretty buns, but they sure tasted good (nice, soft, chewy crust) so I didn't mind that they weren't the prettiest.

Novice Baker here and the bread came out perfect! I only ended up using 3 and a half cups of flour, didn't need 4. I had a lot of dough and experimented with shapes and timing in the oven, regardless of whether I made round dinner rolls, mini baguette styled or a drizzled more olive oil, salt and rosemary on top, it came out perfect. The best basic bread base ever.

Very good rolls, but not quite "to die for." I doubled the salt and got a better tasting roll. The texture and consistency is really good with these, and the recipe is easy to follow for those of us who are not experts at bread-making. I brushed melted butter on top while they were cooking for a nice golden top.

I used a bread machine, used garlic oil and added oregano, everything else as shown. It didn't have the French bread taste, of course, but the texture was there, even at our 6500 ft altitude. Very good recipe.

These were ok.  A lot of work by hand and the dough is very sticky, even when you use the full 6 cups of flour.  Maybe it's great if you have a bread machine...  I thought they were a bit bland (I think next time I will pre-ferment as some other reviewers have suggested) and they were hard as a rock on the outside, though still fluffy inside.  I would have only given 3 stars but am giving 4 because, although I set my oven for 400, it's possible that it's not accurate so maybe the temp was a bit lower than it should have been and this might have contributed to how hard they were-  perhaps they could be better if they were cooked at a higher temp for a shorter amount of time, as I did bake them for a couple minutes longer than the recipe said because I wanted the tops to brown nicely and they weren't doing that even with the egg/water wash.  The tops still didn't brown but I removed them when I realized how hard they were getting.

These were exactly what I was looking for as a base for my Italian meatball subs. I followed the ingredients exactly but used the doughncycle of my bread machine through the first rising. I divided the dough into 10 pieces and rolled them into the shape of a sub/hoagies roll (about 6  - 8 inches long). After the second rising on a cookie sheet, I baked according to the rcipe. They came out perfectly!

These are wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, with great results. I've also kneaded in fresh chopped herbs after the first rise-also delicious.

Perfect for soups, stews, sandwiches! I acutally made about 20 rolls and baked them for slightly less time.
Also, on the second rise, I heated up the oven just a tad and then turned it off, let the rolls sit in there, uncovered while they rose. Worked perfectly.

Wow! This is the first time I have ever made homeade bread and it was awesome! I was really nervous but my husband loved it. He has been craving his grandmothers homeade bread. She passed away and he has been wanting to get the recipe from his mother. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I couldn't believe it came out so good. He loved it and said it was even better than his grandmothers! I was so proud. Even my very picky 2 year old ate a roll and said it was "awesome mama". I did put the balls into a cupcake pan and the rolls came out perfect! I also added a teaspoon more of salt. Will be making more tonight!

My finished product was a flavorful ciabatta, with a thin crispy crust.
I added one more cup of flour and used a heaping tbls of pesto in place of fresh  basil.

My dough was still to sticky to handle, but I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible and pictured this bread would be more like a ciabatta with the extra hydration. 

  I made four loaves on a dark non stick pan.  Baked them at 430 for 35 minutes.  The underside of my loaves were soft, so I place them directly on my hot oven stone for a few minutes. They are delicious.

Wow taste like the old neighborhood served with family passion and love.Made this with the kitchen aid dough hook.Everyone and some neighbors trick or treating asked what I did. So I shared with them. Easy  time thrift yet rates like a dy long recipe!
This is a good one to teach the children the art of bread making. Highly suggest for the beginers!Very Impressive!

I thought that the texture and consistency of the rolls were perfect. However, when I make these again, I will DEFINITELY add salt. That was the only downfall of this recipe. They were a bit too bland for my taste.

Love this recipe - I followed exactly - easy and came out perfectly.  I have made these twice this week already - used for french dip, hamburgers, sandwiches, and snack. I used the bread machine and don't know how you can mess this up. A keeper!

This was relatively easy to work with and make. i followed the recipe exactly and it makes many fewer rolls than it claims, the dough does stick to the towels, so i took the towel off and just left the dough in the oven under the proof setting. so it did rise for the second time, very time consuming even though it is easy, you should probably start these rolls at lunch time if you want to have them for dinner. 
my other suggestion as well is to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, they will be less bland and a prettier color.

I followed the recipe exactly, (it was super easy and all the ingredients are right in the kitchen, all the time) except I added two tbs rosemary for some extra flavor. Worked out great!

These just came out of the oven a few minutes ago. This is my new daily recipe. But I used my bread machine to make the dough, used a bit more bread machine yeast, then after my dough setting was done, separated into 6 hamburger rolls, let them rise again on the pan, then baked as directed. The little sense of golden crunch on the bottom of the roll and super-soft inside is sooo awesome! That is not a typo! The bottom is a nice golden color with a very nice crunch as you bite without being burned or dark. :) I am editing this rating because I just made my second batch today. Really the BEST.

These rolls were bland. Just not impressed at all. The second batch I put in the oven I brushed with egg white and sprinkled with a little sea salt, which helped a little but not enough. Nice crust, soft center but no flavor.

I give this recipe 4 stars because its not good as a dinner roll but its great to make into small "loaves" for maybe a sub or a sandwich. As a roll its really plain tasting and I added vanilla extract.

I added more salt and sugar to mine to give them a little bit more flavor.  Then I don't need to bother brushing any kind of glaze on them as the extra sugar helps them brown.  I make these every week for about 6 weeks now and 2 batches of them disappear during the week because they are sooo yummy!

This is my first time making rolls and they were excellent!! They turned out so nice looking. For the 40 minutes, I put them on a tray on top of my oven and did not cover them. I was already cooking something so the oven was hot. They rose beautifully!

Good bread but tastes more like a plain white bread.  Not chewy or crusty as expected for a french bread, but the texture was soft and uniform.  This would be ideal for mini sliders.  I will be making these again, but for sandwich rolls. Also, they hold up well for the next day if wrapped.

Definitely a 5 star bread.  I have been making this for a few weeks now twice a week, awesome for sandwich rolls, mini bread loaves, hot dog buns, hamburger buns, etc...  I use a breadmaker for the dough and all purpose flour and it comes out perfect everytime.

The taste is much improved by adding an extra teaspoon of salt. The first rise was great, but the second rise was a fail. The "balls" were hard to form in the first place because the dough was so soft it wouldn't keep its shape. They also stuck to the damp towel when I removed it. What puffiness they had left after that fell flat when I ever so gently brushed on the egg white and water. They did rise again in the oven, but look nothing like the perfect balls in the picture :(

I have been using this recipe to make bread for the past couple months and I love it. The bread comes out so delicious! I usually just make a big batch and freeze each loaf in a ziploc bag. To re-heat it i just rub some water on the whole bread and stick it in the oven for 10-15 minutes. It's just like eating fresh bread.

I covered them with the egg wash before baking which made for a pretty roll. They had a nice chewy exterior but the middle was more dense than I had hoped for. I made the dough in the bread maker on dough setting.

These rolls were easy to make, but I found them to be a little heavy and very bland. No one in my bread-loving family had a second roll with dinner. I may try again and add a little more salt.

These were quick, easy, and very good. I made no modifications from the original recipes except to top some of the rolls with garlic in oil, some with a glazing of beaten egg, and some with a little honey mixed with water. Delicious!

Delicious rolls with a chewy, french-bread-texture.  Very easy to make in a stand mixer.  I let it rise for hours around church and still was wonderful.  Definitely a keeper!

These were good, but I had some trouble shaping the rolls evenly to make the number I wanted and had to reshape them. I think the extra handling caused them to be a bit dense, even though I gave them extra time for the second rise. I snipped the top with scissors before baking and brushed them with melted butter. The crust and flavor were good. Next time I will try to form them quickly in one go and I bet they will be just right.

I got the same problems with the dough getting flat at the 2nd rise but I solve it by reshaping them into balls and loaves just before baking and it worked and the first batch tasted a little sweet, not good and then I put some butter on the 2nd batch halfway in the baking. But I am going to find other recipe for french bread, this is not that good.

I tried this recipe for the first time at Thanksgiving and it was AWESOME!  The only thing I did differently was I used an egg white wash to them just before popping them in the oven.

Decent. I had to add more flour to mine but it is rather humid here which tends to make everything complicated. The first batch I made exactly like the recipe except the extra flour and it tasted just like french bread. The second time I added extra sugar to suit the tastes of people I had over for dinner. I liked them both ways.

Great rolls!  I made them yesterday at thanksgiving.  My husband and kids liked them so much they have asked me to make them again today!  I think they will go perfectly with my stew in the slow cooker.

This was my first time baking rolls.  I would agree that they need just a bit more salt.  Instead of the beaten egg white, I brushed on melted butter once they were done, and put them under the broiler until they browned; it didn't take long, so keep an eye on them.  The texture was perfect, and they look great.

I'll start by saying...I have never rated a recipe before on this site.  However, I had to take the time to say....THESE ARE THE BEST ROLLS EVER! I've never had bread come out perfectly but these were amazing.  Perfectly crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks so much!

Oh. My. Gosh.  If I could give these 10 stars I would!  They were so easy to make and they taste sooo good!  The dough was light and airy and made me smile :)  It came together nicely and the instructions were clear and easy.  I'll be making these all the time this winter!  Can't wait!

These were pretty good, I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. I also was impatient and I didnt wait the full 40 minutes at the end for the rolls to rise, but they still turned out good. These were very simple for someone who has never made bread before

I love this recipe, easy and delicious. I have made it about 5 or 6 times, pretty much followed the recipe as written, except for I substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil, since olive oil is usually the only oil I ever buy. I guess I also use all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and I do use the egg wash - the rolls come out shiny, with a crispy crust and a nice soft inside. I was very happy when they turned out looking just like the photo! I definitely recommend this recipe :)

Very impressive result - good rise, slightly crusty, nice flavour. Theses rolls also look the part - even better than bought ones. I made 18 rolls from the quantities outlined - which made just the right size of roll to use at dinner or as a sandwich-type roll to be filled for lunch.

This was the first recipe for bread/rolls from this site that actually turned out really nice,and I have tried 4 now.I followed the recipe as stated(used all purpose flour) they turned out light and fluffy on the inside with a slightly crispy outside.A bit bland in flavor but with a great recipe your own personal touch is what makes them yours.Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars because it's easy, tasty and has all the ingredients that even a newbie like me has on hand. I had some whole wheat flour on hand and replaced 1 cup of the white flour with it. It turned out to be delicious. I took them out of the oven before the 20 minutes were up because they had got quite hard. All was ok though, since they softened upon cooling and were perfectly baked.

This was a very good dough recipe, but I don't think I will use it for rolls. I liked it best as a cinnamon roll dough.

These are good, they are crusty on the outside and the inside has a good texture. When I make these again I may add in some more seasoning or honey like other reviewers:)

I used my bread machine, then turned the dough into an oiled bowl to rise again - it did so beautifully, and I was so optimistic about this recipe, but then the  rolls themselves only rose a little and looked flat, almost like biscuits, instead of the nice round rolls I was hoping for.  Flavor was better than appearance, but still on the bland side.  I might try this one again replacing some of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour - maybe that would help the flavor for us.

These rolls were crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  The problem was the taste...they were just bland.  I added extra salt along with the sugar.  I also added a tbsp of honey.  They would have been great if they had a better taste.

I have made this recipe many, many times!  I have not changed a thing about it.  It is so easy to make in the kitchen aide.  I shape them into sub rolls.  We absolutely love them!  Very easy and great flavor.

I didn't have bread flour, so used 1 cup oat flour and about 2 1/2 c AP flour. Like another reviewer, I added more yeast to make up for the lack of protein in the flours. Everything else was the same, but I think 1 additional tsp of salt and 1 more tbs of sugar would have helped (because of the oats).   I'm a novice bread maker, and this is recipe was a great success for me. It is crusty on the outside, but light and fluffy in the middle! Highly recommend this recipe.

I also changed the recipe up a bit after reading the reviews. I put 1 1/2 tsp of honey and 2 tsp of salt. I also brushed the dough with ice water before putting it in the oven and I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes. Mine didn't puff up into balls. They look like hamburger buns, but they taste wonderful!...and very addicting!

I used AP flour. After reading reviews, i added 1 1/2 tsp honey and doubled to salt to 2 tsp. the flavor was great! my only complaint would be that they turned out a little flat, more like hamburger buns, but that may have been because of the flour.

I have been making bread for a long time and this is one of the best. I did not shape into rolls but baked in a long loaf pan periodically brushing butter on top. My husband and I have almost eaten the whole loaf!

Just baked these during a huge Nor'Easter blizzard and what a treat it was to have the smell of fresh baked bread waft through the house.  My rolls didn't rise as much as I thought they would but I think it's because I didn't let them sit long enough before putting them in the oven.  Very tasty, thought they'd have a crispier crust.  I'm a novice bread baker and I'm happy with my first attempt.  Will definitely try this one again.

I used all-purpose flour and it turned out great. Although I only ended up using about 3 c. (excluding the plenty of flour I had to add to my counter while kneading). Very good. French bread in a roll. Way easier than I expected, and I even kneaded it by hand. Thanks!

These are so easy and really, really good.  Every time we go visit, my father-in-law asks us to bring these!  I like soft outsides, so I just place the rolls on the pan so that they are touching.

Characteristic of this bread:  It has a thin and hard outside crust. The inside was soft and a little firm. Positive Aspect: The dough was very easy to knead and shape. Negative Aspect :The taste of this roll was bland. I would recommend the amount of salt or sugar be increased. The bottoms of the rolls were burnt in 18 minutes. I always an use oven thermometer during baking ensuring accurate oven temperature.

I made 8 mini baguettes, used olive oil and baked @ 375 for 20 mins. I did use the egg wash for a nice shiny,crispy crust. I also used my bread machine on the dough cycle. Everyone loved, served with a nice warm bowl of homemade chicken soup.

Used bread machine on dough cycle - very tasty. Didn't take quite as long for me to bake and I made them into bigger rolls of a lesser quantity too.

I wanted a good roll for sandwiches, so I made 8 rolls instead of 16 (might make 12 next time as they were pretty big). I made an egg wash with 1 beaten egg and 1 Tbsp. of water and brushed that on right before baking. I topped half the rolls with black sesame seeds. They looked gorgeous and tasted wonderful!

I followed recipe exactly and thought they were good.  (not great, but good) Great recipe to start from, but just a little on the bland side.  Will have to add some things next time like honey or more salt.  My three year old loved them!

I just love this recipe! My husband loves French Bread so I thought it would be great to try it in rolls instead. They turned out perfect and I've made it at least 5 times now. I also used the recipe to make a French Loaf. Tonight I'm making the buns slightly bigger and using them for hamburger buns. A great recipe.

Not bad! I really like it! I made 32 buns, and 10 people ate them all ine one meal!!! I ate four! this is a great recipe. I think that you could add a bit of honey to make it a bit sweeter, but apart from that, a great recipe!

I made these with a couple changes.  Added about 1/4 tsp more salt and a tablespoon of honey.  I also made them big enough to be sandwich rolls and used them with the french dip crock pot recipe here.  DELICIOUS!

I'm on my third time making these simple and delicious rolls.  Simple and fun to make...they add a special touch to almost any dinner, and are so good the next morning with butter and honey or real maple syrup.  I can't applaud this recipe enough!

These rolls were wonderful.  Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  I followed the recipe with the exception of brushing the rolls with beaten egg whites before baking.  The dough was so easy to handle. To prevent dough from sticking to the cloth, always choose a bowl at least 3 times the size of the unrisen dough.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.  I will be making more of these for the holiday season.

I am amazed!  This is the first time I have made yeast bread from scratch and they came out wonderful!  It was so good smeared with butter and dipped in the beef stew I served it with.  I was able to stir 3 cups of flour into the dough, then another 1/2 cup while I was kneading it.  Next time I would like to add an egg wash to make them shiny!

I brushed the top with butter and added taco cheese and garlic powder. Tasted yummy and goes well with Italian food. I wouldn't say they're to "die for", but they're pretty good.

This is a very nice recipe - easy and tasty.  Mine didn't have a crispy crust, but I think that's because I was roasting vegetables at the same time and that probably added a lot of moisture to the oven.  I made them for guests and everyone liked them.  It says it makes 16 rolls, but I got twenty that were as big as hamburger buns.  In fact, I can't wait to use these as sandwich buns!

GREAT!  I used my bread maker on the dough setting.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of honey.  Subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil and used 100% whole wheat bread flour.  After the bread machine did its magic, I twisted the dough into 16 balls and half of them I molded into oblong 'mini' loaves.  I then allowed the dough to rest (about 15 minutes) before baking in the oven to allow them to rise a bit more.  I then baked at the given time but only for 10 minutes.  As soon as they came out, I let my hubby try one and he melted like butter!  We are going to be having a date night in and having these rolls again with some fancy cheeses and wine.  The rolls are delish with oil and dipping seasoning! WOW!!

It's true, these are "to die for".  I did take the advice of others and added about 1 1/2 tsp of honey to the proof mixture.  I'm at high altitude and for me it took 3 1/2 cups bread flour and I also lowered the heat to 375 and they came out fine. Didn't change the other ingredients. Baked until the tops were light brown then brushed with butter then put back in oven a few more minutes to a nice golden brown. The crust was crisp and the inside was chewy as advertised.  These were perfect with the easy french dip recipe.  Too bad it didn't turn out for one of the reviewers.  Avoid terry cloth towels, they will stick to rising dough (i've made that mistake) and flatten your buns. If you bake flattened dough it will be hard like cookies (my sister in law did that and yes the rolls were bricks) Use linen type kitchen towels, they work better

These came out awesome! I used All Purpose flour but still ended up with a nice crisp crust and soft but chewy inside as the recipe promised. I just wish my rolls didn't flatten out at all during the rising process. Next time I may bake it like dinner rolls so they can "press against each other" and remain more round. Thanks for sharing!

Good French rolls.  Not sure if it really did much, but I followed someone else's suggestion and sprayed water on the rolls while baking.  I baked 15 minuters, misted with water and then baked 5 more minutes.  I didn't put the second coat of egg b/c I didn't want bits of egg on my rolls.  Don't bake as long as the recipe says or it will burn.  Would make again.  Might cut down on the yeast to 1 tsp, rolls tasted a bit yeasty.

I followed the recipe as stated and thought these were pretty good but lacking just a bit in flavor.  My rolls were a bit dense for french bread, but I'm not sure if that's the recipe's fault--in all fairness, I can never get yeast breads rights!

Great recipe!  I'd do something to add a tad more flavor to them next time.  Overall, a great bread to go with any meal.  This bread will not overpower the flavors of a meal.  Delicious!!!  After I wrote this review, I used some of the rolls to make mini breakfast sandwiches.  They were perfect!

These were AMAZING!!!  I am fairly new to breadmaking, and this is by far my best result yet.  I attempted to make garlic rolls by using garlic salt instead of regular salt (1 1/2 tsp) plus 1 minced large clove of garlic...very mild garlic flavor.  Next time I will try 2-3 cloves, but otherwise the basic recipe was great.  Either way, my family of 4 ate at least half the batch shortly after they came out of the oven.  Great recipe...lives up to it's name.

These rolls were a winner at a family function.  I put them in a bread basket next to the cheese platter, black forest ham, toppings & mustards for mini sandwiches.  They went quickly.  Oh, so good.

I have tried a few different dinner type rolls and this by far is the best! I really didn't want to buy another kitchen gadget like say a bread maker and because of this recipe, I don't have to! I did brush melted butter over the rolls right before I put it in the oven and a few times in the oven, and it still gave me a crispy crust, chewy texture plus a buttery taste.

It was very sticky dough.  I had a hard time making them into balls but they still tasted excellent and were fluffy and good.

Wow! These are super good! I can't wait to make them again and try them out as hamburger buns! I agree with a bunch of other reviewers- needs more salt and/or sugar. Great versatile roll/crust/bun recipe. Thanks!

For the first time trying this recipe I love it. The outside of role is a lovely and crispy the inside is perfect and medium fluffy. Nice easy recipe. I made my rolls bigger than suggested. I will continue to make these rolls for breakfast, dinner or lunch lol.

These are my go to bread rolls now. The recipe is so simple. I like to put the starter in the fridge overnight, bring to room temp and then bake. I also "rough up" the tops of the rolls to get a crunchier exterior. They're best slightly cooled with a(generous) spread of President's or Lurpak slightly salted butter. Delicious and simple, thank you for the recipe.

This is simply the BEST!!!!  Did use breadmaker using dough setting.  Sprinkled cornmeal on baking sheet, and brused with 1 egg white with a tablespoon of water before baking.  Crusty outside and sooo tender inside.  Hubby loves them, so will make over and over again.

I make French Bread and homemade pizza quite often and was looking for a new recipe...this is pretty bland.  I added an extra teaspoon of salt, and, in my opinion, it could have used at least 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt, maybe 3.  However, this was an EXTREMELY soft and fluffy roll!  With a few modifications it could be awesome (possibly add some parm. cheese or italian seasonings to dough and/or on top)

Wouldn't say they are "to die for" but they are simple and taste like French Bread. Better than store bought French Bread.

I think I did something wrong.  I had read a review that the rolls tasted like english muffins and I thought that was weird.  Well, mine tasted like english muffins..  lol.  They were still really good.  I didn't have any bread flour and maybe that had something to do with it. My rolls didn't rise like I wanted them to. I will be making these again and trying a few of the suggestions from other posters.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

These were to die for! Hubby got me a bread machine (since I suck at kneading my own) and they turned out terrific!  Will become the staple "roll" recipe in our house~thanks

This recipe IS to die for! I absolutely love these rolls. I first used them with "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip" from this site. YUM!!  The rolls were gone so fast. My husband said he would eat these more than candy (and that's saying a lot with his sweet tooth!). I use a bread machine to do the dirty work. I brush the rolls with melted butter partway through baking, and I bake them at 375 as previous reviewers suggested. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made these bread rolls by hand. They were soft inside with a very lovely crust. Regarding flavor, this is a really good basic recipe, but it is not a bread to die for.

This is a really good recipe, but like others I tweated it a bit. I use 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water, 4 tbsp. sugar. Right before baking I add an eggwhite wash and shred some parm cheese or some flake salt ontop of the rolls. This is a very STICKY dough, so the moment it pulls from the sides, turn it out to knead. I always end up adding anywhere from 1/2 cup to a cup while kneading. The kids love them, and they are very tasty- enjoy

Really good, easy too. Cook time was off though. I made them into 9 buns. I checked on them at 16 minutes and the bottoms had already started to burn. I think maybe 350 and not 400 would be best.

Perfection. Great taste, great texture, great recipe with clear directions. I did bake for a few minutes less, but my oven could just be a little off. I brushed the tops with melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven which made them extra yummy. Thank you :)

These were good, I made them for shredded beef sandwiches. Though I would like something a little more dense and chewy, but i'm pretty sure that happens with adding all the flour not just most of it like i did.

I love to make my own bread so it defies logic that I don't own a breadmaker.  But, since I don't, I'm limited with the recipes that I can make.  I have to say that this bread was GOOD!  I wasn't too dense or too bland. Just good bread without any ingredients that made me wonder "what's that?!!"  I will definitely make again!!

A lot of work for not so good rolls.  No real flavor, just tasted like flour and water to me.  Will keep trying to find that great recipe.

I have made this recipe four times. Now, I reduce the amount of water and add milk. I also add more sugar. The recipe by itself is very nice, but the addition add an extra kick.

This is the first recipe I tried from this website. Everyone at my home loved it. I only wish it would have been a little flakey inside. I am not sure if I did something wrong. But if anyone has any idea's how to make them a little softer and flakey that would be great.

Very good but I'm still looking for a really fluffy type roll. Maybe I didn't knead enough, not sure.  I'm new to using yeast. But I will use this again. Thanks for sharing

This recipe is wonderful. I double it and keep some in the fridge, then I can make fresh rolls daily. People that had bad luck might have had old yeast. I never put a damp cloth on my rolls when rising and they never stick. I do think the bread flour is essential to a good turn out.

these had good flavor and baked nicely I should have made less of them and made them bigger. I wanted to use them as sandwich rolls not dinner rolls. They were a big small if you make as many as the recipe says

SO, easy and the texture was great.  Crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle.  The flavor is a little bland though.  Next time I think I'll add melted butter instead of oil and up the salt and sugar a tiny bit.  I made the dough in my bread machine, punch it down, made the balls, let rise and cooked.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent rolls. Used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Made a double batch and served "easy slow cooker french dip" on them. Will definately be making these again very soon.

these rolls are fabulous!  i halved the recipe but will not make the same mistake twice.  i brushed them with egg white and water before baking and threw ice cubes into the oven twice.  only baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect.

????? Could be the best but I need help.  After forming the rolls I covered them with with a damp cloth and after rising when I tried to uncover them all of the rolls stuck to it and deflated.  I almost cried but instead I said oh !!! a baking adventure.  As you can imagine they were awful.  I still have half the dough.  Any suggestions?  Thanks

Awesome!!  FINALLY a roll recipe that didn't let me down!  I used my bread machine for the first couple of steps but used the ingredients exactly as written. They came out great!  They are perfect for sandwich rolls or hamburger/hotdog rolls!  THANK YOU!!

I cannot imagine why anyone would not LOVE these rolls!  My one comment would be that I wouldn't call them "French Bread" rolls, b/c they really don't have that texture or taste, but, honestly, these are some of the best rolls I've ever eaten, regardless ... oh, something I did:  I made 12 dinner-sized rolls, then formed the last of the dough into two large torpedo/sub rolls, for sub sandwiches tomorrow night for me and my S.O.

I liked your recipe very much and I thank you for making it available.  I only have 4 of them left, since the women in the food department of the hospital I work for really love these rolls, I hope they start feeding them to the patients.

I followed the recipe exactly. These just didn't turn out like I'd hoped. I think I might have overcooked them and also overcrowded them on the baking sheet. 

I'll try them again at another time. Right now, I'm just not impressed.

First try at making any type of bread and I used all purpose flour, because I read the recipe wrong.  Will probably try again with bread flour next time.

Just ok.  Mine didn't turn out nearly as delectable as everyone else's photos!  They tasted pretty good, but ended up flat.  I did sub whole wheat flour for AP...would this make them flat?  I'm still hoping for the results I see many many others have achieved, so I will try again and use AP flour and see if it makes a difference.

I have never made bread that tasted this good. I did add more flour as I am sure many people do in order to make it the right consisitency while kneeding. It had nice crusty outside and soft on the inside. Thank you

I needed a good, basic roll on short notice and this was perfect.  My guest (aka my mom) actually did the baking, and she whipped these up in no time.  She's an expert bread baker & I noticed she used a wet paper towel during rising.  She also said she added some flour. (experts add/delete based on the day's humidity and 'feel' of the dough) She only used the KitchenAide hook for kneading. (cheating, but sometimes I do too)  All of us LOVED the taste and texture.  What we were too full to eat at dinner was consumed at breakfast with butter & honey. I'll make this many more times!!

Wow, these were easy!  I made them into sub buns to have with Italian sausage, they worked beautifully.  I had a few leftover, so I cut them in half and made garlic bread on the next day. Delicious!

These are awesome just as the recipe calls for.  I have also made them with either 1 -2 Tablespoons minced garlic added or with 1 tablespoon of rosemary added to it.  They make great hamburger buns. My family loves them.

THESE REALLY DESERVE A 5-STAR FOR THE TASTE BUT I REALLY HAD A TOUGH TIME WITH THE DOUGH! THEY STUCK WHILE RISING TO THE TOWEL AND I HAD TO THROW THE TOWELS OUT! I CANT WAIT TO TRY AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT WAY OF RISING! THANKS =]

everything was going fantastic until i tasted them...they were bland but i think just a smidge more salt would be fine but the main issue was they came out dense and heavy (with weight). i could've thrown them through a window. it had to be something i did...maybe i needed to let them rise more?

These are so easy to make and so much better with the meal than the store bought kind. I added some kosher salt and dried herbs to the top, which added that extra touch. Rave reviews from all the family, even the 3 year old!

These were good but not much taste. They are missing something, "flavor".  I followed the recipe and they are easy to make and do bake up like the picture.

Not sure I will make these again.

These are super!  I made them to serve with the French Dip Sandwich recipe from this site.  As noted in other reviews, I doubled the sugar and the salt, but used garlic salt instead of table salt.  These are so easy to make and delicious!

Upped the salt a bit, that's it!  GREAT BREAD!!!  To make sure the rolls didn't stick to the cloth during the final rise, I just took it off every 15 minutes, re-wet a bit, and replaced.  I even sprinkled a little kosher salt on the top before baking.  Really good.

This is the one. i've always used a bread maker to make my breads. not any more. My husband just loved this one. Instead of making rolls I made bread. When it was half way done baking, I rudded some butter over the top of it. That was the key, and it also made the top golden brown. We loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Just finished baking these rolls. I followed the recipe and they were good and easy to make, as they rose quickly. A little bit bland but what white bread isn't? i served them with pesto gnocchi. A great addition to any meal. I ended up making 16 just as the recipe states. Maybe next time i might mix some herbs and powdered garlic in it.

Very Good rolls.  Light and fluffy. Very easy to make.  The only comment I have to make is, for some reason, I was thinking more like a dinner roll.  If you want these for that purpose, in my opinion, making the 16 out of one batch, makes them a little on the bigger side...like more the size of a smallish sandwich roll.  Still very good and will be making these often.  Thanks!

These rolls were AMAZING! My kitchen smelt like a bakery. I followed the recipe exactly, and the result: perfect, crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside rolls. I made eight sandwich rolls and I thought they were huge. I think next time I'll make 9 sandwich rolls instead.

These rolls are to great! Not only do they turn out each and every time, you can do so many other things with them. I usually roll them in poppy seeds, and if making for breakfast I will add a little saffron and honey to the mix!

These rolls are fantastic! My husband is a little picky when it comes to homemade bread, but found these excellent! I made eight big rolls out of the dough, which lets you use them for sandwiches. Yum!
I will definitely make these rolls again and again!

Really good and really easy. The only trouble I had was that when I went to take off the damp cloth after the second rising it made most of the rolls deflate. The brushing on of the egg mixture also deflated them some as well, but they puffed back up pretty well in baking. The dough was beautiful and so nice to work with. I will defenitely make these again.

These were very yummy!!!  I made 12 rolls rather than the 16, but everything else was done exactly as stated in the recipe.  I made them for my hubby to use to dip in his soups, but will have to set some aside for myself just to eat with some butter.  These weren't all that time consuming as most yeast breads are, which was nice.  Will definitely make these again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first successful attempt (after many failures) at making yeast bread of any kind, plus my husband and kids loved it; so for that I would give it five stars.  But I have to knock my rating down a little because as some other reviewers said, it's taste and texture is nothing like French bread...more like regular white bread.  Not quite what I wanted but still good.

Very good recipe! I used 1 cup WW pastry flour for part of the flour and honey instead of sugar. I tried to make these into hot dog buns, but I had no idea how, so they ended up as huge hoagie-type rolls! Too much bread for our hot dogs, but they were delicious.

Well, I have to eat some crow. At my daughters request I tried these again, and they were fab. However, that being said, you only need to bake them for 12 minutes, otherwise they will burn. I still only got 14 rolls out of them, but they were great. I can't wait to try this as a loaf...it was better than anything you can buy from the store. The first time I made these I made the following mistakes. Don't bake for suggested time, only need to cook for 12 mins. And do not use a damp cloth. My dried out the final rise and when I removed it, the rolls fell. The second time I just through a dry cloth over them like I always do and it was perfect! Great recipe! Thanks!

Wonderful! From now on I will be making my own french rolls. I plan on serving these with baked ham   for Christmas Eve, and I can't wait to make them to accompany char-grilled burgers. The only change I had to make was to cut the baking time down to about 12-15 minutes, but that is probably just my oven. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was great and easy to make with a bread machine.  I tried two batches, one with all white flour and one substituting 1c whole wheat flour.  The whole wheat recipe didn't taste quite as good as I thought it would though.  The original recipe was very popular and I already had to share the recipe with others.  Thanks!!!

Very good.  A little on the sweet side, I think I'd cut down on the sugar next time, but I will definitely be making these rolls instead of buying french bread at the store!

Wow, these were so yummy and soft inside.  Made these for company one night and they were gobbled up immediately.  I love the ease of the recipe too.  Very simple and very few ingredients.  This recipe has made me a homemade "roll-maker" from now on.

This is absolutely wonderful bread. I decided to make a loaf instead of rolls and turned out just as well as the rolls. Definitely something I am going to make over and over again.

These are the easiest and most fool-proof rolls to make. I added 1/2 tbsp. more sugar and 1/2 tsp. more salt in it since other reviewers suggested it and they were good but next time I make them I will use a tad more sugar still since I like my rolls sweeter. I used butter instead of egg on the tops and they turned out crunchy on the outside. Didn't have any problems getting them to hold their shape while rising. Thanks for sharing.

I very much liked these rolls, but have to only give it four stars as I expected a crustier "French Bread" type crust.  These rolls had a nice smooth, soft texture both inside and out.  They were easy to make and the taste was excellent.  Again, my only complaint is that I was looking for a harder flaky crust like you get in France!  Still, I would make again especially for filling with sandwich meats or cheese.

These were pretty good. . . I made them for Easter dinner at the in-laws.  They were well-received but I didn't think they were anything super out of the ordinary.  Sorry, maybe I did something wrong. . .

These are the BEST rolls I have ever baked.  This is the only recipe I will use from now on for making rolls. I have seen the reviews of others about the damp cloth, I just used a dry folded cheesecloth and had no problems. These came out fluffy with a crunchy outer crust. Thanks so much for sharing.

I have rated this recipe in the past, but it just keeps on giving. These rolls freeze wonderfully, thawed out at room temp. they are soft and fresh. I tried using the recipe for sausage link, peppers and onions, what a delicious combination with thie recipe. I have also made crescent rolls and they were a hit. Thanks again. Ken R

Yummy :) and easy :) It tasted kinda like an english muffin to me, but the bread itself was nice and thick so I think it would stand up well for something like BBQ sandwiches or sloppy joes... First time making bread and it came out right :)

These were great. I made them for a big pot of potato soup, but ended up having extra so used them as sandwich buns for pork the next night. My husband said they were great. I used my breadmaker. Really easy...not very time-consuming. Will definately be a keeper recipe for this house!

these rolls are great!!  I used the egg wash and then added seasame seeds.  I made 5 oblong rolls (served halves at dinner and the remaining for next day sandwiches)-next time I could get 6 though...Next time I will also add more salt...the sugar was great where it was, just a bit more salt needed for my taste!!

Simply delicious! My family at the whole batch in one shot! I'll have to double this recipe in the future, they're just as it says, crisp on the outside and chewy in side. I made these by hand, and seeing as to how it was my first bread making experience this recipe is for anyone who would like to impress. Thank you for this recipe.

My family loves this french bread!  I use a stand mixer and a baking stone. The crust is crisp and the inside is soft and chewy. I do recommend using the egg wash..it makes the bread look wonderful. I have made it into rolls and even used it to make a ham and cheese bread braid. My husband was so impressed! Thanks so much for this fool-proof recipe!

These are great!  I followed the recipe as written.  I also followed previous reviewers' great suggestion to weigh out the dough - that will be my new habit.  I got 16 2-oz beautifully brown rolls.  I baked them on a baking stone with some ice cubes in the oven to make a deeper crust.  Delicious!  And simple, since I let my mixer do the kneading.

Wonderful recipe, I followed it exactly, I made it twice now, once with rolls, then as a loaf of bread.  I let my bread maker do all the work, then took the dough out to form rolls.  Thanks great recipe.

These rolls turned out great. I took the advice of other people and put in half the sugar and double the salt. I didn't do the egg wash.

Mmm... really yummy warm out of the oven.  Okay after a few hours.  Not very pretty, though.

These were great! I served them as French Dip Sandwiches on Sunday and I'm already getting requests to make them again! They don't make the # of servings it says, unless you want tiny rolls. They didn't look as pretty as the picture, but I'm sure I'll get it right!

These coming out hard or not fluffy like french bread should.  I have made this recipe 4 times and the results vary so much that I have given up on it.

I scaled this recipe to four servings because my boyfriend doesn't eat much bread.  I made it into rolls for dinner.   He was VERY impressed and asked me to make them again!!  I brushed them with a little oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  GREAT!!
