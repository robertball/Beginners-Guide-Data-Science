This is a delicious salad - SO simple - and Healthy to boot!. I love avocadoes and tomatoes, and the two complement each other very well. One suggestion - serve this salad right away: if it sits too long, the avocado begins to soften and break down and kind of "melts" all over the tomatoes - it still TASTES delicious, but it LOOKS better/the colors are more vibrant of you serve it right away. I will definitely make this again and again!

Only need 1/2 cup (no 8oz) of dressing and about a quarter of the red onion.  Otherwise, this is a crowd pleaser!  I used the leftovers as chunky salsa to munch with tortilla chips.  SO GOOD!

This was awesome! I also added yellow bell pepper and diced all of the veggies. We ate this on top of angel hair pasta and it was divine. Pretty colors, too!

I'm giving this only 4 stars for the sole reason of the way it looks.

This is extra simple to make, it looks beautiful till you put the dressing on.  Then it looks brown.  I will try my best to make a different dressing.. or even serve the dressing on the side.

I used A LOT less than a full cup of vinegar and there was still a ton pooled at the bottom of the bowl.

it was good though and I'll try it again.

I would not have thought something so simple to make could be so good, but it is.  I skipped the onion since we're not big onion eaters around here.  I only used enough of the dressing to lightly coat the avocadoes and tomatoes, and set it in the fridge while the Barlows Blackened Catfish (also on this site) was cooking in the oven.

I liked the idea of this but didn't care for the bottled balsamic dressing part, so I used olive oil and fresh lemon juice at a ratio of about 3:1 instead.  Very nice.  It was a pretty, refreshing and healthier alternative with our omelets this morning to the more typical hash browned or oven fried potatoes.   Unfortunately, due to hard and virtually tasteless mid-winter tomatoes it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been.  While this recipe is not much on creativity, it nevertheless is a simple and basic little salad we enjoyed.

This is a wonderful and easy to prepare salad. I serve it as a starter salad when company comes over. I like to cut the avocado lengthwise and reserve the shells to be used as mini "bowls" for the salad. (1 avocado yields 2 mini bowls).

I wish I could have rated this a 3.5 due to the amount of dressing stated. Common sense will tell you not to use it all. I made my own dressing using white balsamic in order not to hide the beautiful red, purple and green colors. Other than that, this was a wonderful and delicious salad Mica. Thanks!

We loved it!  Thanks.  Be sure to use somewhat firm avocados so it doesn't get too mushy.  Another suggestion for those who don't like the way the balsamic dressing changes the color of the salad: 1) as others have suggested, serve the salad before the avocado browns and 2) make your own dressing using WHITE balsamic vinegar (I buy it at Trader Joe's).  This will help retain the bright colors of the salad.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  After the first time, I decided to substitute red creamer potatoes for the onion, and it's delicious.  Everyone always loves it.  I don't think I've ever used a whole bottle of dressing for it--I just do it to taste.  I also don't have a specific amount for the potatoes--I would say a pound or two, cut in quarters...

Followed recipe but made my own vinaigrette with white Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and spices.  Used a Vidalia onion instead of a purple one, because Vidalias were in season.  Excellent salad.

This is good, but too much onion.  I like my version better with 1/4 red onion, and with Italian dressing instead of balsamic.

I made this same salad basically, the other day, and was bored with eating it. The only difference was that recipe used homemade balsamic dressing. I found this recipe and decided to add some avacado to it to to change it up. I liked how the creaminess of the avacado gave a different texture to the crunchy vegetables. My only advice is that if this is for company the balsamic vinegar will turn the veggies a brownish color. I might try this same recipe, scaled down again, with a white wine vinegrette.

Love it! I'm not a big lettuce fan so this is a salad I could eat several times a week. I may cut back on the amount of dressing though next time...was pretty saturated. Made it extra tasty, but I could use cutting back the calories a little. :)

Loved it! I had something similar to this in NYC, and I added chopped celery and quartered hard boiled eggs to top it.  Also I cut the onion down to 1/4 instead of 1 whole.  Was awesome with Tortilla chips! I also served it with BBQ chicken we had the other night.

I made this salad for a company BBQ that was desparate for some healthy veggies!  I omitted the onions and mixed in about 1/4 cup olive oil and vinegar dressing into the mixture.   I topped a bed of baby spinach with the tomato/avocado mix; and spread croutons around the plate.  It looked great and was gone in a flash!

Delicious and so easy to make! Even if you don't like avocado, it's great! I think some of the previous reviewers were confused - I used 1 cup of salad dressing, like it calls for - and it was the perfect amount. Not too soupy at all!

Very nice, although there is no way on earth you need to use an entire 8oz bottle of dressing! I wish I hadn't refrigerated it so long though - it lost some flavor. I will make this again but will add some shredded purple cabbage, some sliced yellow and orange bell peppers, and some fresh snipped chives. Very colorful and flavorsome. Thanks, Mica!

Very beautiful, simple, and delicious, especially when the advocados are really ripe.  I used large grape tomatoes and it worked really well.  Somewhat bland, but very fresh tasting.

The taste is great, but the original recipe calls for way too much dressing.  I used about 1/3 of the bottle and it was still too much.

FANTASTIC recipe and beautiful presentation! Just make sure to prepare your salad no more than 1hr prior to serving and refrigerate (so avocado doesn't brown). Bring to table without dressing and add at meal time (prevents dressing from mixing with avocado for too long, which promotes a mushy texture with the dressing). Have served with both Emerald's balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and Aldi's (with a dash of garlic, fresh cracked black pepper and and salt for added flavor). Now a family favorite that I will serve again and again. Thank you!

Have made this several times, but cut it down to one large tomato and one avacado for just the two of us. For the onion I use a small red onion cut in half circumferencialy then julienned and about 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegarette dressing. Absolutely fantastic. Wife loves it. She is a salad type person and wants this one often.

I have made a salad for two by using 1 avocado and 1 big tomato chopped and served on hearts of romaine lettuce. I have added two caps(about two or three tablespoons) of Newman's own light balsamic vinaigrette. It was very tasty! The salad did not look brown and the avos stayed green while it was cooling in the fridge. I noticed with other recipes that the salad dressing can really make a difference on how your salads taste, and I have always had good results with Newman's own dressings.

I have recently made a similar salad.  It used avocado, tomato, a sweet onion, cilantro and green pepper with lime juice as dressing.  I  think it has more punch and flavor than this recipe.

It's so easy to just make your own balsamic dressing....1/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 Tbs. dijon mustard, pinch of black pepper, and freshly chopped basil.  Ta Da!  I added green peppers picked fresh from my sister's garden to the platter of sliced tomato, avocado, and red onion.  This was a wonderful side dish to a summer-time grilled Orange & Tequila Chicken entree!

The taste was OK but the appearance wasn't attractive because of the balsamic dressing.  If I make it again I'd use another dressing other than balsamic. A full bottle would have been way too much for the quantity of other ingredients.

Great recipe, but I was skeptical of the dressing. Try this instead: juice of 1 lime, a splash (~ 2 tbsp) of water, 1 tsp of sugar and a bit of black pepper.

This salad was excellent.  I did use about a 1/4 cup of my home made balsamic vinaigrette and thought that that amount was perfect.  Thanks so much for posting a new favourite salad recipe.

This is great! a tip, if you don't want the advocado to turn brown add a dash of lemon and it will keep it green. Lovely simple salad.

This was pretty tasty. I've made this a couple of times when I just happen to have all ingredients on hand, and need to use the produce.  I probably won't go out of my way to make this again, but it's perfect if you have ripe avocados and tomatoes.

We like this recipe. We used our favorite bottled dressing instead of putting our own together. We added the avocados last because of the other reviews, it was a smart thing to do. They get a little creamy when stirring and discolor the rest of the salad.

I love avocados and tomatoes, so this recipe of course was a hit with me and my family.  We ate it with salmon, absolutely perfect together.

Simple but great!  I just used balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and also added a little cilantro since I was serving it with Mexican food.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, I added crumbled feta cheese to the mix, excellent flavor. I made it with a different dressing, a little olive oil, red wine vinegar and a shake of seasoning salt, mix, very zesty and easy to make for small amounts.

I originally was going to make this recipe for 6 people, using 4 tomatos and 4 avocados, but chickened out and only used 2 of each. What a mistake everyone devoured it. I also added pickled sliced garlic to it and used maybe a 1/3 cup of dressing. Next time I will make extra. Thaks for a great simple recipe.

THIS WAS SIMPLY AMAZING,MADE THIS FOR MY PARENTS AND THEY LOVED IT.IT WAS QUICK EASY AND GOOD. MY HUBBY EVEN TRIED IT AND HE DOES NOT EAT ANYTHING THAT WAS IN THE SALAD EXCEPT FOR DRESSING, LOL. I CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF AND THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR 6, MAYBE WE ARE SMALL EATERS.

I made this for lunch with some friends and they raved about it. I made my own dressing using olive oil, balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar, a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper and fresh basil. I also added feta cheese. I was fabulous. I followed others suggestions and cut back on the dressing. I served it with crusty bread. Every one wanted the recipe.

I thought this was just ok. I added some fresh squeezed lemon to keep the avocado from getting brown. As I said, I will try to make it again, but this time, add the cilantro as another person suggested.

Definitely simple.  I followed other's suggestions and found the cilantro to be most important.  Without the cilantro I think it would have been too bland and boring.  Otherwise, excellent recipe and everyone loved it.  Easy to make, and it is going in my recipe box to be made again and again!

Very enjoyable.  My husband and children neither of which like tomatoes enjoyed it.  The calorie level and sodium is a bit high so we will make it only occassionally.

We love avocados, so this easily became a favorite. Yeah, I didn't have balsamic dressing, so I just splashed on some olive oil and balsamic vinager to taste.

I liked the flavor but it was way too soupy. I reduced the recipe down to four servings but the ingredients were floating in the balsamic vinegarette. I should have just eyeballed it. Make sure your avocados are firm and not too ripe, you will end up with mush otherwise.

I did not use the salad dressing, I used about a tsp of white balsamic vinegar and drizzle of olive oil. I halved the recipe as well and added English cucumber (diced)  and crushed garlic.  I used 3 green onions instead of red onion.  I served it within 15 minutes and it was beautiful and delicious.

My tomatoes were very juicy and I should have been more careful adding the vinagarette. It ended up soupy. Very good but need to use veggies that are not near the end of their shelf life and go easy on adding dressing.

I found this to be just OK.  I wasn't fond of the textures going on.  It might be better if you just serve the salad with the dressing on the side and drizzle it on right before eating...for us anyway.

Fantastic and simple recipe. I'll note that 8oz of balsamic vinaigrette dressing is waayy too much. And since I have balsamic vinegar, I mixed my own dressing with about 2 tbs balsamic vinegar and 2 tbs extra virgin olive oil.

I used cherry tomatoes & cut them in half.  Forgot the pepper but didn't miss it.  Very tasty salad, and it was quick & easy to make.  I think I'll cut way back on the dressing nex time, it was way too much for my tastes.

I found that the balsamic dressing seemed to over power the avacado, which is the flavor I had been craving; however, other than that, this was  a delicious salad that my family loved.

first off, i must say that i am not a tomato fan nor avocado (unless its guacamole) but i wanted to try this recipe just for something new.  if you like tomatoes, i think you'll love this recipe!  it really has fantastic flavor.  the only change i would make is to add less dressing - just enough to coat it is all that's needed - it doesnt need to swim in the dressing, that's a waste.  also, i chilled it for 1.5 hours at least and the avocado still looked perfect - not brown at all.  i plan on forwarding this to my tomato-loving mom!  thanks!

It's hard to go wrong with tomato and avocado.  This is so yummy.  I only used 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle of dressing and put it on the table for anyone that wanted to add more.  I found that amount to be plenty.  I did the same with the onion.  It makes a wonderful summer side.

Love, love, LOVE this! I made a half-recipe, knowing I would be the only one to eat it at my house. Did not use the pepper, because I forgot to add it, and didn't miss it at all. Used Kraft Balsamic Vin. dressing...very good. I devoured a half recipe in 4 sittings. Lovely, thank you!

This simple recipe rocks!  It never occurred to me that balsamic vinegar on avocados would be so tasty.  I just made one serving, so a couple of tomatoes, half an avocado, and a drizzling of the dressing was sufficient (not a fan of onions).  Fabulous!

This was really yummy!  My husband was apprehensive but after he taste it he ate all that I made.  He like it so much, I had to make it again the next day for an appetizer.  A+ recipe.

This is SUCH a delicious and easy recipe.  I recently brought it to a "salad" putluck with a few modifications: i added bacon and shredded mozzarella and i used a red wine vinaigrette.  Also, it's important that you use *good* tomatoes, you know, that are actually red and have flavor.  i had friends call me months later for this recipe.

This was a big hit when I served it as a last minute sidedish with eggs benedict (we have them for dinner occasionally); was a perfect companion dish to offset the richness of the hollandaise sauce.  Not the prettiest salad perhaps, but quick, easy and,most importantly, very tasty :)

Simple and yummy! You know your taste. Add as much red onion and dressing as you like.  Definitely make this salad right when you are about to sit down to eat.

Very refreshing!  I added some diced fresh Mozzarella and let it all marinade for about 4 hrs..Excellent.
I served it with this sites Salsa Chicked recipe and it was a great compliment to the main dish!

So simple and yummy.  For those who are turned off by the "brownish" color, try white balsamic vinegar.  I agree that 8oz is too much dressing.

This salad is good, but the dressing does not make the salad look appetizing.  I did use a lot less dressing then the recipe states but the veggies are sitting in a pool of brown liquid.  My kids (who are young) wouldn't try it, and my husband said he liked other tomato salads that we have tried better because of the dressing.

When I was on my honeymoon in France, we had an avocado and tomato appetizer that I absolutely loved. I was trying to find a recipe for something similar since I couldn't remember exactly what was in it and came across this one. This recipe was good but not quite as good as the appetizer I loved so much in France.

Absolutely delicious! This is a new favorite for my avocado-loving household. My changes: I use chopped scallions because I don't like onions, I cut cherry tomatoes in half instead of dicing a whole tomato, and I add the dressing to taste. A great summer side to grilled salmon and angel hair pasta.

Great Salad! Everyone enjoyed it and went back for seconds. I didn't add as much dressing as others suggested and I also added feta, cilanto, dash of lemon, and slivered almonds! Will definatly make again.

Next time use white balsamic as the brown makes the salad ugly.  It was just okay for us.  I think I would try it again, but would rething the dressing or something.

It was really good.  Just like others mentioned about cilantro, yes, you need to put chopped cilantro.  That is what makes this salad soooo good.

A nice fesh tasting salad. I didn't buy an avocado that had ripened enough, but I will give this recipe another try. Would be a great salad if having a BBQ, just need the avocado to be softer.

This was good.  I didn't measure the dressing, just poured a little bit on.  I was making it for just my husband and myself, so I used one tomato and one avocado, and probably used 1-2 TBS of dressing total.  Good fresh flavors.  There are some leftovers, which I'm sure are pretty mushy by now, but they'll probably be good served with tortilla chips!  We had it yesterday with a barbecue.
