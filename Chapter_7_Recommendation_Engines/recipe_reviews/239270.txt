To make it more flavorful, half the water and replace the other half with wine. Use the wine to deglaze the pan after browning the chops. Can also add more seasonings like garlic, basil, parsley, black pepper, etc. Also, this serves maybe 3-4 people and not 6.

This recipe was easy to make and I like that it went in the oven. The rice in this recipe was outstanding and flavorful.  I am going to make this recipe again because time got away from me on checking the pork chops. I would suggest checking the pork chops at 40-45 minutes to see if the meat is at 145º.  I unfortunately overcooked my pork chops. So, I was a bit disappointed in myself.  Forgive me, rev'd up chef. I will try again because I think this recipe is probably excellent when rev'd up chef made it.  My husband couldn't say enough about the rice. A good recipe on a cold night!

Excellent recipe! I make this quite often now and my family loves it! Typically I don't even put the meat on the skillet first and it's still great. Tonight I'm making it with chicken because that's what I have on have and I'm sure it will be great!!

This was really great and adaptable!  I used "Better than bouillon" to make my broth.  Added chopped green bell pepper with onion to saute, which I topped the chops with before covering with foil.  Seasoned chops lightly with ground pepper, garlic and just used a smidgen of the seasoned salt.  I sprayed my dish lightly with cooking spray.  I had 5 thin bone-in chops.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes then cut the heat back to 325 the last 15 minutes; let sit covered for 5 minutes after removing from oven.  The rice absorbed the beef flavor and was cooked perfectly.  We loved it.  I think the secret to cooking this is to make sure the broth is boiling before adding to baking dish with the rice and seasoning your chops to your preference.  Just don't add too much salt as chops and bouillon are naturally salty. I agree with another reviewer that if you are using thin chops, this will probably serve 3-4 adults instead of 6; my husband had 2 chops.

I made this tonight with brown rice.  Because brown rice requires a longer cooking time and more liquid than white rice, I made a few changes.  I cooked the sliced onion, removed it to a plate and then sautéed 1 C. Brown rice until it turned white.  Then I stirred in 1/2 a bay leaf, 1 scant tsp. Salt, 1 tsp. Dried parsley, 4 whole black peppercorns, and ? tsp ground thyme and spread the rice in a baking dish.  I heated 2 1/4 C Chicken bouillion (powdered plus water)  in the microwave while I browned the seasoned pork chops.  I moved the pork chops on top of the rice and added the onions.  Then I poured in the nearly boiling bouillion being careful to keep the rice flat and under the pork chops and onions.  I baked this covered dish for 70 minutes.  My husband loved it.  Next time we may try adding Cajun spice on the chops for more zing, but this was a dry run for a meal for a family with young children.

made this tonight for dinner and the boyfriend and I both loved it!! The only things i did different were I added mushrooms to the rice mixture and coated the pork chops in flour mixed with salt,pepper,and garlic and browned them in the pan b4 adding it to the rice mixture. since it was just for the 2 of us I used 2 big bone in pork chops and cooked for exactly an hour and they turned out perfect! my boyfriend claims it's the best pork chops he's ever had. will definitely be saving this recipe for future dinners!

Made it for a second time...was even better.  Instead of water, I used water with two beef boullion cubes.  Since there is only two of us, I had 4 chops and 1 cup of rice.  Cooked only 30 minutes.  The chops are perfect!  Never dry.  I love this recipe!!! No leftovers.  I look forward to making this easy recipe again and again!!!

I substituted the broth with any bottle of BBQ sauce and mix with 2 cups hot water so rice will cook properly. Entire family loves this dish and super easy so it's part of meal cycle.

Loved this dish but like most other people I had to change it up a bit to suit our tastes.  I used beef broth in place of the consommé and water and added one beef bouillon cube but it was almost to salty so next time I will omit the beef bouillon cube.   I used garlic powder in place of the seasoned salt because we like our pork and beef seasoned with it.  Turned out tasting very well with a little bit to much salt but not to bad.  The pork was tender and moist and the rice was perfectly done.  I didn't use minute rice and didn't pre-cook my rice.  I used a little more butter then the recipe called for.  I know it's not healthy but it sure brings out the flavors well.  I wish I had had some green onions but my yellow ones worked just fine.  I also loved the ease of putting this all together once you get your onions partly done and your meat browned.  Will be making this dish often form now on.  Like that you don't have to stand over a hot cooktop and don't end up with tons of dirty pots and pans afterwards to have to deal with.

I used 4 thick boneless loin chops seasoned with Weber Steak & Chop seasoning.  And I used a "royal blend" of rice: texmati white, brown, wild& red rice. 2 cups of beef broth. should have stopped there. I added a cup of water to make the 24 oz of fluid. 

My side dish was already oniony, so I left the onions out. I added 2 small chopped green peppers,  fresh & local.

Didn't stop Mr. Man from tucking in! 

Will be a repeat.

used this recipe for the thicker pork chops without the rice and they came out fantastic. It was my first time doing the thick chops so I was a bit nervous but everything came out great. The only change I made was I seasoned the chop with  onion powder, garlic powder, mrs. dash and thyme. And when I put it in the oven I covered it with foil for 1 and they came out almost falling off the bone.

Very good and flavorful. I increased the consommé to 20oz and decreased the water to 4oz for more flavor. I also threw in a dash of Kitchen Boutique Browning and Seasoning Sauce. My dish was baked fully at 40 minutes and the rice was perfect - didn't taste dry.

Great recipe, "supper" easy for anyone, and, like others said, you can add mushrooms, bell pepper, black pepper, and your other preferences, so you can dress this up in different ways and cook it often.

Delicious!  I added mushrooms & bell pepper to the mix, plus browned the chops with a spicy mustard and Worcestershire coating.  Added a little vegetable broth to the recipe because I was short on the beef consommé & it was still a very flavorful rice.  This was a simple but great dish.  I baked for exactly 1 hr. & 5 minutes.  Used long grain rice because it bakes better than my favorite medium grain.  Husband asked for a repeat, soon!   Reading the reviews really helps, when trying something new...  It made enough - leftovers for 2 and reheated chops in skillet with broth & the rice reheated well in my rice cooker.

So yummy... I didn't even have to fry the chops first. Allen said I use onion soup mix. And chicken boy on instead of the beef.

I made this exactly as written using 1" chops and baked at 375 for the full 60 minutes.  I think it would have been 5 stars if it hadn't come out over-cooked.  It tasted very good, but the chops were overdone and a bit dry, and the rice was overdone, making it a bit mushy.  It would have been even worse with the thin-cut chops specified in the recipe (though exactly how thin wasn't clear).   Next time I will take it out of the oven as soon as the rice has absorbed most of the liquid (checking to make sure the chops are done, of course). Shorter cooking time and/or maybe reducing the oven temp to 325 should help this recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly. The rice was very good. I'm not a huge pork chop fan, so they were just ok in my opinion; but my husband loved it. At least it's a different meal...I would make it again when hubby craved pork chops.

This was good and easy. The only thing I did differently was to add 8 Roma tomatoes that I needed to use up. I chopped them and added to the rice & broth. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the good recipe!

Three stars because:
A)  While the meat was tender,  that is only because I took it out about 20 minutes earlier than called for.  By that point, the rice was dry. Yes, I kept it covered with foil.
B)  The meat needed much more seasoning than called for.  If I make it again, I will add more herbs and some paprika
C)The rice was bland.  Next time, I will omit water, and use more consomme, upping the liquid a bit.
I will try it again with the above changes.

I didn't have any beef consomme, so I used three teaspoons of "Better Than Bouillon'' beef stock mixed with 24 ounces of water.  Deglazed the pan that I browned the pork chops in with a tiny bit of red wine and added that to the beef stock.  Followed everything else as written.  Made it for company and everyone loved it.  Thank you for a keeper!

Excellent recipe, very good. Very easy and quick.
I substituted boneless country style pork ribs for the thin pork chops. It's worth taking the time to cook the onions, and mushrooms to a good brown state. Also add rosemary to the recipe, it goes great with pork.

Love this recipe. I made it just like the recipe. Next time I will add salt to the rice and  liquid mixture before I put the pork chops.  Love the fact that it cooks in one dish. It was very good. I recommend this recipe for a quick meal.

I had purchased boneless pork chops before finding this recipe, so was grateful for many of the suggestions made by others, including the advice to brine for thicker and/or boneless chops. Instead of the consomme/water combo, I used approx 20 oz of beef  broth (orrington farms) and 4 oz of wine that I used to deglaze the pan after cooking the onions (w/ green peppers and minced garlic added) and browning the seasoned, floured pork chops. I highly recommend using a meat thermometer as I think it would have been overcooked without it. Rice was perfect. Paired it with butternut squash, complemented it well if looking for a comfort food/Sunday night dish.

I used one can of campbell’s consommé with the water and the whole family said it was the best rice ever.  The chops however were dried out, so I’m not sure how to fix that problem....but I will make rice again this way!

I like this recipe because it uses most pantry staples.  I didn’t use consommé because I was out so I used beef bullion.
Other than that it went together easily and added a salad & some fresh garlic bread.

I made it with half red wine per the previous poster. I also used Olive oil instead of butter and sauteed baby bella mushrooms with the onion. I sprinkled the pork with rosemary, salt, pepper and garlic before browning.  I used a combination of basmati and wild rice too instead of plain white. That s is a good basic recipe that really can be tweaked for any taste.

I’m a guy so...bear with me. I made it with all the ingredients- except beef consommé. I even used some wine. Came out perfect!  I browned the pork chops but could have done it a little longer to improve the flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes and I make it often. I made some changes to the recipe by adding mushrooms. Also, I used two cans of 10-1/2 oz. beef consommé soup and 3 ounces of water to make up the 24 oz. of liquid. We prefer beefier, more flavorful tasting rice. Cleanup is easy, which also makes this a great choice.

I made it exactly as directed. Except I used a little red wine to Carmelize the onions. I also cooked the rice with half broth the other half red wine and coffee. I added a little browning sauce too. With the carmelized onion and pork drippings the rice was incredibly flavorful and the pork nice and tender. Really good! Only baked about 40 minutes. Just check after 40.

This turned out well. I used Brown rice and it wasn't done all the way so I moved the rice to a saucepan to finish cooking it. The onions gave it great flavor.

I will definitely keep it in my "go to" recipes. The rice came out perfect. I didn't change a thing except halving the recipe because I only need meat for my husband and my son.  The only drawback was that I didn't read the recipe all the through the first time and missed the length of cooking time. I will plan ahead next time.

Really good! But we prefer a bit of gravy over pork chops, so pored some cream of mushroom soup over top of the chops. I mixed in some garlic powder & herbs before I did, adding even more flavour.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The pork chops were very good, tender and tasty. The rice was a different matter. When I took the baking dish from the oven, the rice was less that half done. I had to remove the pork chops and put the baking dish in the microwave for 7 minutes before it was done.

Amazing!! I have made this multiple times but changed something this time and it turned out even better! I added two billion cubes to the 10 oz of water and I also deglazed the pan after the pork chops were done with white cooking wine as another user suggested. I scrapped all the bits from the pan and put them into the baking dish with the rest of the stuff! I will make this again sooo good!!

This tastes great. Very easy to make. Just make sure you season the pork chops the way you want it.

This was far better than expected. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough flavor so I spiced it up a it. I was wrong and should have stuck with the recipe. It was really good and everyone loved it. Thanks!

Great recipe. Fast and easy prep. Just remember to brown the chops good. They taste better that way.

I almost followed the directions. I used all beef stock and added red bell pepper to the onions. I will use much more onions and red bell peppers next time and add some butter to the top of the chops while baking. the chops only needed @45 minutes. the rice was terrific, the chops a little dry.

Love this!! If you use Brown rice, up the cooking time by a half an hour or par cook the rice before putting together. Be sure to deglaze the pork chop skillet with a smidge of white wine and add all that wonderful fond to the dish! 

Will definitely make again. Thank you!

We enjoyed this very much.  Chops were super tender and tasty.  I most always follow recipes exactly, however, I had to make a little change because of the ingredients I had on hand.  My beef consommé was a 10 oz can not 14 so I did 10 oz of consommé, 10 oz of water (as per recipe) and 4 oz of white wine :) Worked out quite well.  Also due to OUR preference, I coated the chops in flour before browning.
Will definitely be making this again.
