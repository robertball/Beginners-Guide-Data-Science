These were pretty good, but the flavor was not unique enough to warrant the 2 hours+ it took to cook in my opinion. Somehow my rice took longer to cook than directed and I had to keep adding more coconut milk. You could not taste the five-spice at all; I would perhaps double it. I ate mine without cheese but my husband thought the pepper jack made for a strange combination. We both kept adding salt. I like the idea of this recipe but will not make again.

These are definitely the best stuffed peppers I have ever had. I didnâ€™t cooked the onion for an hour only about 10 minutes and added more of the Chinese spice to the rice mix. The total cook time was about 75 minutes.

This is a good combination with the turkey, coconut, and pineapple. Needed a little more taste to it though. I used shredded monterey jack cheese and would probably change that next time. Will make again!
