I've made these cookies over the last two years and the recipe works great for large cutout cookies! The kids love to roll out the dough and decorate them after. These are supposed to be "tea Biscuits", but I love them rolled out thin and cut with cookie cutters big and small.

These are good if you want a real light dessert or snack -- they are not very sweet. I doubled the lemon extract, which worked out well.

This recipe was difficult to roll out whether refigerated or not.  It needs more lemon extract.The cookies were hard as a rock.After making them I checked internet resources to be told NEVER MELT butter; it makes cookies too hard which is true!

made these with my children. Nice simple recipe to follow. you must chill dough in fridge if you want to make shapes with cookie cutters as it was a bit sticky. They tasted lovely  - nice with a cup of tea !.Children really loved them . They kept quite nicely in an air tight tin for three days. Would make again. My husband enjoyed his with some vanilla ice cream. Oh and make sure you take them out of oven when EDGES are turning golden brown as they cook faster on the bottom and may burn without you realising!!!!

My daughters really liked these. The only thing they said was that the lemon taste could have been stronger.So next time I'll increase the extract or use fresh lemon juice. I will be making these again. Thankyou.

These are great! It's really just a lemony sugar cookie but that's just what I wanted. The lemon flavor is very mild so next time I might use a little more extract. This ones a keeper!

Well I used pancake mix instead of all-purpose flour, but I only had two cups left, so I had to shrink the recipe until it only called for 2 cups. The rest of the measurements were so hard to understand (5/8 tbs, etc) that I gave up trying to measure them and just threw stuff in. Too bad the flour already had salt in it, cause after I put the salt in it was almost unbearably salty. To balance this out, I had to add more flour (of a different kind, this time whole wheat) to try to dilute the taste. But then it got too dry, and as I was out of butter I added random amounts of soymilk and grapeseed oil in small increments. I didn't have lemon flavoring either so I poured almond extract in there. Also, I tried to add lemon zest but couldn't find the gratey thing so I used a fork which didn't work. Eventually I had to peel the stuff off with my fingernails, but they were too big so I put them in a garlic squisher thing, which didn't work as they're flat, so I had to tear up each flake of lemon peel by hand which took about an hour. I got impatient with rolling the dough into balls so i just took big hunks of the stuff and put balls of random sizes on the pan with some coconut flakes on top. It came out great and tasted like lemon scones. This recipe didn't work at all!

The best. I used part arrowroot flour and part whole wheat. They were just right. I baked them a little longer. Next time, I will experiment with orange extract.

These were a yummy light snack, very easy to make didn't have any problems with rolling out the dough I just had to make sure I floured the surface and roller. I made them thicker than the recipe called for..still really good!

The dough rolls out well even if refrigerated overnight (time contstraints) and makes for a crisp cookie. Happend to  have fresh lemon on hand so added some of the juice and grated rind in also. Was making this for my son who loves lemon flavor so I made a lemon glaze with powdered sugar, lemon extract lemon juice and brushed it on the cookies for that extra lemon kick! A keeper recipe.

Followed the instructions (including melting the butter) mostly, substituted lemon extract with lemon zest and juice. The flavor was really nice. Wish it was a bit harder/crunchier so I'll probably alter it a bit next time. I liked how many this yields, great for parties and as gifts.

I made this recepie for the first time and they are perfect (not too sweet) ....the only thing I've changed is I used coconut essence instead of lemon,but still doubled the amount as I read that the flavour is not strong enough!! Lovely....will do them again!
