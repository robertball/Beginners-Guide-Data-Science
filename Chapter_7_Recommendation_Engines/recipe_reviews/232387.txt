Wow. This recipe was taken ingredient by ingredient off of a website without any credit being given to its creator. The recipe went viral on Pintxxxxx. The recipe is great ... Thanks Ingrid.

This was a super easy and delicious meal!  I used a pound of Bob Evans bulk zesty sauasage and a nice pinot grigio & a slug of sherry for really drunken noodles.  Took a little liberty with the cooking method to make this a breeze, just sauteed the sausage in a non-stick pan without oil until about half browned, then added the sweet peppers and onions and finished browning/sauteeing together.  I then added the seasonings and deglazed with the wine.  Then in with the tomatoes and basil (I used about 1/2 a cup, love the stuff).  I didn't boil this down, the broth is so good, and I added the noodles directly into the pot to coat, more like the stir-fry version of the asian recipe this imitates.  Shaved parm on top.  Definite do-over, so tasty.  Thanks for shaing this recipe with AR, a hit! PS: I find pappardelle pasta at World Market.

Ohhhhh, yeah.  I am in awesome supper Nirvana after eating this.  It was like ET phone home, even tho' I'm not home - in other words, this is pure comfort food, with familiar flavors and ingredients that made me a very happy camper.  This,  a tossed green salad and my favorite Zin  made for a satisfying meal, and this was so easy to prepare given I had leftover linguine in the fridge.  I pretty much followed the recipe, tho' I did not use the "Italian seasoning"   -  I really dislike the stuff.   I deviated by using some fresh cherry tomatoes (this meal was just for me so it was impractical to open  a can of tomatoes) and  I gave it a good dusting of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano  right before sticking my fork in it.

I prepared this as written, but instead of pappardelle pasta, I just used some egg noodles that I wanted to use up.  I prepped all of this early in the day, keeping the sausage/pepper mixture separate from the cooked noodles and reserving the parsley and basil to be added when reheating.  I covered everything and put it in the refrigerator.  When it was time for dinner, I combined everything and reheated it and dinner was on the table in 10 minutes.  We both really liked this.  I served it with a tossed salad and garlic bread.  And I added some red pepper flakes to mine!  The only change I would make next time is after browning the sausage I would saut√© the peppers first and then add the onion.

Lord, we have been making this recipe since the 60's! We simply call it 'casserole'. Everyone in the family knows exactly what we're talking about. I've made it with half-half good ground beef & a dash of red pepper flakes.  Really, isn't this just the most versatile recipe on the face of the earth? So about the noodles. We Italians know that the shape of the noodle serves a purpose. Meat based recipes want long strands like the pappardelle in the picture, creamy sauces need a cup like pasta & soups/stews like small pasta. I always serve homemade chicken soup with Ancini de Pepe although when the kids were kids we sometimes used "stars" (stelline). For minestrone I use ditalini, for baked dishes usually penne, for cold salad dishes definitely farfalle, for stuffing, manicotti & shells.  My grandmother made made fresh pasta what seemed like every single day - by hand - no pasta machine back then. She made long flat strands that we had with spaghetti, which wasn't from a recipe (well I'm sure it was originally) but she used what she had in the house. My favorite was when she added fresh peas. Oh. My. Gosh. For her soups, which were legendary she took those same fat noodles & cut them into little tender squares. My grandfather was a master chef, but he would only eat Grandma's cooking, she brought 3 meal/day to his nursing home. It's sad living in Seattle, we just don't have the pasta choices that I had in Ohio or wherever there are large Italian populations - send me some!

Made this as instructed and it was wonderful. Simple flavors brought together without fatty sauces and cheese. My teenage daughter loved it as well. This one is going in the family recipe book!

Amazing dish.  Easy to make and yummy. I used a small can of fire roasted tomatoes and used only red and green peppers.

I made this last night for the first time.  I didn't have Pappardelle, so I used Fusilli.  I think egg noodles would also work pretty well.  This was very good, easy, and fast.  Great hearty, weeknight meal on a cold, rainy Halloween while watching scary movies. Good comfort food. I didn't have yellow or orange peppers, but the red peppers were fine.  I did add more Chardonnay than called for, and found it needed additional salt and pepper.  I'll definitely make it again, though.

I've made a similar recipe a million times with much less ingredients and everyone seems to love it anyway.... egg noodles...ground beef browned with diced onion...add a can of ro-tel to the final mix and voila...simple filling comfort food for those less inclined to go all in.

Pretty good. I used fresh tomatoes and fresh flat leaf parsley- all else the same. When I make again, I will drain off grease.

I was really excited to make the recipe, but was disappointed. I used sweet Italian sausage since I didn't have spicy and instead of using fresh parsley, I used dried because I didn't want to go to the store just to buy it fresh. I also used linguine noodles since I couldn't find pappardelle noodles. Anyways, there just wasn't enough flavor in this dish for me. Maybe it was because I used the sweet Italian sausage. If I make this again, I'll use the spicy kind or just add crushed red pepper flakes.

Definite keeper. Didn't need quite as much bell pepper-- ended up using 1/2 green and 1/2 yellow. Used a can of Rotel tomatoes, and also some bulk sausage fried out first. Drained the grease from the sausage and rinsed the meat in a colander as I usually do. This is an easily adjustable recipe. I didn't use much oil at all, didn't need it. And I finished it off with shaved Parmesan cheese as another reviewer did. Excellent!

This was fantastic! The flavor was very good. I didn't use spicy sausage because my family would rather have mild. I would recommend adding the cooked pasta to the sausage mixture because it will really add flavor to the pasta as well.

Tastes quite boring in my opinion.  The flavor and ingredients feel more appropriate for a pizza, not a pasta dish.

Great recipe! My husband and son asked for seconds and they hate everything I make! Really! I substituted chicken broth for the wine and broad egg noodles for the pappardelle pasta as I have no idea what that pasta is and couldn't find it at any supermarket. Worked fine. I do have a question, though. It calls for 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and 1/4 cup shredded fresh basil. Step 5 says to add about half the basil and parsley. It never says what to do with the other half of each??? Any ideas? Enjoy!

Update: 2/9/15
Finally got some pappardelle pasta from Amazon. Discovered that the broad noodles found in any grocery store work just as well. Won't bother ordering again. I have been reducing the amount of HOT Italian sausage and mixing in more and more MEDIUM Italian sausage each time  I make it. I'm not a spice lover and my husband is. So far, he hasn't complained and I'm liking it more. I'll keep reducing the amount of hot until I get negative feedback. Still wondering when you are supposed to add the other half of the parsley and basil. This has become my family's favorite dish.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. I did substitute fresh grape tomatoes that I halved, because I had some that needed to be used. I increased the wine a bit to make up for the juice that would have accompanied the canned tomatoes. I really like the freshness the grape tomatoes brought to the recipe.  This dish requires a substantial pasta. If you can't find the pappardelle, I'd recommend, fettuccine, penne or rigatoni. Sometimes it fun to use the round pasta's so the meat mixture becomes a nice little surprise inside it. Don't forget to top with freshly grated parmesean to take this creation over the top.

Excellent!  I would suggest using fire roasted diced tomatoes though, the smokynes seems to lend with the sausage. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer adding 3 ounces of fine sherry.  OMG. It was AWSOME. 1/4 tsp of sugar also mellows and brings out more flavor. I prefer adding Parmesan flakes to the top when served but this as is is a great recipe.  Craig

Delicious pasta dish!  Having an open bottle of Pinot Grigio that needed to be used (I don't like it to drink, but like to cook with it) I remembered this recipe that Saveur talked about.  I mixed up the sauce portion earlier in the day, and reheated it at dinner time when I had the pasta hot.  I couldn't find pappardelle pasta, so I used penne.  The next time I'm going to try this recipe with Italian diced canned tomatoes for additional flavor.   Served this with corn on the cob and a tossed salad.  We enjoyed a very nice dinner.

Followed recipe  as written.  Easy to prepare  and little to clean up. 
We liked the flavor but felt it needed a little more. Plan to 
make again with spicy sausage, I used mild this time.  Also
will add italian seasoning. This will go in our make it often  folder.

Simple and delicious.  Apple juice can be substituted for wine and because my boys don't care for tomatoes, I use a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste instead of canned tomatoes.  If you do that, you must be sure not to let all of the liquid cook away.

Bland in spite of all the herbs, yet overly salty. I questioned the amount of ingredients for just 8 ounces of pasta but it did seem to need all the tomatoes, not sure about 3 peppers though. Recipe in the shredder.

Fabulous dish and in our regular rotation. Kids didn't like the width of the noodles as mush as the parents did, can always substitute a different pasta.

Mushrooms?  Very tasty and quick.  Made it just as directed and used some noodles from the local whole food market (Mama Jeans - Trecce Dell'orto Pasta)

I substituted spaghetti squash for the pasta and it was delicious. The sauce is so good it works well over anything! The recipe didn't mention what to do with the reserved basil, so I just put it all in the sauce, although it would have been pretty sprinkled over the top.

I left out the peppers because of family who won't eat vegetables.  I also pureed the onions and tomatoes for the same reason, and this dish was still amazing!  Definite "do it again"!

Great recipe.  Had most of the ingredients on hand.  Lots of vegetable chopping but worth the effort.  Used mild Italian sausage and Italian style diced tomatoes.

this was delicious!  I used spicy italian turkey sausage because that is what I had and it worked great. I couldn't find the pasta it called for so I used penne, worked pretty well but after reading another review about sauces and types of pasta I think I will try again . this is going on our repeat list!

Since I am on a mission to try new, easy recipes, I decided to give this one a try.  It was excellent.  However, I knew from looking that two cans of tomatoes would be too much for us so I used only one can of tomatoes.  I used only a fraction of the parsley and basil that the recipe called for and we topped it with Parmesan cheese.  This recipe will be in our dinner line up.

This is a wonderful "light" pasta meal that is hearty and robust, yet lighter on the calories.   I followed the recipe exactly except I chose chicken sweet italian sausage to cut the fat even more.   Delish!

Very good!!!! I used half the oil and salt cause you never know how salty something can be. It is now one of my favorites. I will make this a lot.

Awesome!  I did make a small change to the recipe, I used chicken breast instead of sausage.  Also, I added a bit of heat I added some chili pepper flakes, but other than that pretty much stuck to the recipe.  It was great!  My husband loved it and so did I.  I will make this again, might use prawns next time!

I used 1/2 mild sweet italian chicken sausage and 1/2 sauteed chicken tenders , used lemon herb seasoning (instead of italian), and added 1 can artichoke hearts and chopped sundried tomatoes to step 3.  It was delicious, with a light herbal lemony citrus yet savory flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper

Great recipe! I will never buy spaghetti sauce in a jar again. I could not find parpadelle pasta anywhere so I decided to use rotinni. Next time I will use crushed tomatoes.

We love it! Gave the recipe to a friend and he and his girlfriend think it's the best pasta They've ever eaten. I usually use a smaller can of  tomatoes and a can of Rotel to add a little more bite, depending on how hot my company likes things. I like linguine noodles

Followed the recipe pretty closely except I had some Campari tomatoes so substituted for canned. Receipe was every thing it promised. Easy and good. In fact easy enough that I had friends over on a weeknight, and shopped and cooked and was ready for guests at 7. Best part I had most of the ingrediaents on hand and the sausage were on sale, so with a salad it cost less than $30 to feed four. Everyone liked it, men particularly. So will definitely make again. With a healthy sausage (which I did not use) and whole grain noodles this could be a healthy dish as well.

Excellent meal.  I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  I only used 2 bell peppers and a dusting of red pepper flakes because we like a bit of a bite to most of our food.  I did use good high quality Italian brand diced tomatoes, which I do believe makes a difference, at least to my palette. They are a staple in my pantry.  FYI, The sauce freezes really well. You could make a big batch of it and freeze it for future meals easily.

Ok - so hello, the tomatoes in the picture do not represent diced tomatoes from a can .. BUT - man, a nice little recipe.  I enjoyed it.  I spared the parsley, used the basil.  Happy to find the noodles.  I can't wait to try it as a leftover.

Oh Yum! I'm eating it straight out of the pan as my husband's late! I added mushrooms, used Jimmy Dean Italian rather than link, pureed the tomatoes to make it thicker, used the entire parsley bunch and added the noodles to the pan so they could get the flavor too - I used Mrs Weiss Kluski egg dumpling noodles I found at Walmart (they're perfect for this and are delicious!)
