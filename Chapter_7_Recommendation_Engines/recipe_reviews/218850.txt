Fairly basic and reliable rendition of Italian Sausage and Peppers. I personally prefer it without the basil.

Oh my, there's nothing quite so tasty as Italian sausage and peppers! This is so simple yet tastes so good. Perfect for an easy weeknight meal. I opt out of the basil and add a little dry white wine. This is wonderful all by itself, but I opted to put this on toasted hoagie rolls. For a quick and easy meal nothing beats this!

My husband loved this.  The only change I made were to eliminate the yellow pepper, since I didn't have any in the house.  I will make this again!

Classic recipe for sausage and peppers.  Reminded me of being at my Italian grandmother's house when I was small.  I made mine even simpler than the recipe - I used a bag of Birdseye Peppers & Onions instead of all the chopping and cutting.  Incredibly quick!

This was absolutely delicious. I tossed mine with angel hair pasta. I think the fresh basil is the key. I love fresh basil, and it really gave it that extra kick of flavor. Yum!

Yummy!  I don't particularly like the casings left on, so removed them, broke into 1-inch pieces and fried them along with the peppers and onions.  The Italian tomatoes with this is really over-the-top good with the oregano in the tomatoes complementing the fennel in the sausage.  Great recipe on its own, on a roll or even over pasta.  We enjoyed it!

This is a great base recipe and can easily be used from filling sandwiches to topping great pasta dishes or some potatoes. I love it!

Really liked the flavor of this!  I sliced the sausage lengthwise, served it all on hoagie buns, and put shaved mozzarella on top.  This made an excellent Sunday supper!

My husband was quick to give this 5 stars.  He loves this.  Seriously, how can you go wrong with Johnsonville Italian sausages with peppers and onions? The only change I made was to use fresh tomatoes from the garden.

Easy, quick, and delicious! I had never tried Johnsonville Italian Mild Sausage Links before, but now that I have, I will definitely be buying them again. I made this recipe and served it on toasted ciabatta bread with provolone and parmesan cheese.

Great recipe and pretty easy to make aside from all the slicing. Just the right amount of tomatoes too. I bought fresh hoagie rolls from the grocery store to make grinders and my boyfriend loved them. I mixed sweet and spicy sausages, next time I'm going all spicy : )

Delicious meal as is I served mine over a bed of brown rice, and used fresh basil rather than dried.

I thought it was very easy and fast to make before going off to a sports practice with the kids. But I also added some cubed pineapples!!

Just an easy, basic recipe w/ a nice flavor and lots of color.  I love the smell of this cooking as it wafts through my home.  And it's delicious too!  I served this on kaiser rolls.

This was interested. My boyfriend prepared this for dinner tonight and I don't know if there was too much oil or if the juices were supposed to be drained from the tomatoes, but it was really more like a soup.

We've been enjoying a similar variation of this recipe for years - we like to serve this tossed with fettuccine or linguine and topped with a little grated Parmesan. Absolutely delicious and love how full of fresh veggies this is. Thanks for the great recipe Johnsonville! (Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage is our favorite - it works really, really well in this recipe).

This came together super easy! I love those kind of recipes. I served it on a sausage roll and added Ore-Ida tater tots on the side. This was a great meal to serve up in a hurry.
