I tried this on split breast chicken in the oven and didn't have enough brown sugar to complete the recipe, but nonetheless it was a solid rub that served the purpose well. I'd recommend a little more cayenne for a little more kick, but it depends on what kicks your proverbial fancy.

I made this rub as the recipe is written, and smoked some chicken thighs on my Traeger Grill.  My husband liked the flavor better than the Traeger rub that came with our grill, which was a little on the sweet side.  This had just the right amount of flavor and a little kick from the pepper.  Excellent.

I made this rub for some barbecued chicken and it was delicious. I made my rub less spicy by using one tablespoon of black pepper instead of two. I also eliminated the cayenne. It was still spicy, salty and a little sweet! Yummy!

My husband loved this rub!  He declared it delicious :)  I used coconut sugar in place of brown, which worked out great!  Cut back on the salt some.  Fantastic!!!

I made the rub and added a little oil to marinate my chicken thighs over night in the fridge. The chicken really soaked up the flavor and turned out great!

Rub is very good on a smoked chicken.  Will have to try it on pork.

Used it on chicken & everyone loved it,,,a lil spicy so if you have lil ones use a lil less cayenne pepper.  Tonight I grilled and added a lil avocado oil so it didn't stick.  Worked great TFS !

I made this. It was awesome. Although my family does not like hot stuff, so I cut down the cayenne to 1 teaspoon and the black pepper to 1 tablespoon.  It had just the right kick.

Great flavor but a little to spicy for me. Next time I'll use a little less cayenne pepper.

Enjoyed this rub.  Dropped the cayenne a little due to the kids.  Worked well on ribs and will use the remainder of it on some chicken.

Delicious! I used this on chicken and it was great! We like things spicy, so I'll add more cayenne next time, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect since we had guests over and we weren't sure about their spice tolerance.
