Served this recipe to a monthly dinner group and it was a hit! Recipe was easy to follow. Be prepared, this makes a good hearty serving and filled up a casserole dish easily to the top.I substituted 1 cup of clam juice with the chicken broth and it kept it moist. Will definitely serve again!

It was sooo easy. I was a little more generous with the saffron because I love it so much.  Even my kids ate this all up with-out a single complaint about there being rice in it!  They usually complain about rice.

I really liked it, though, it was hard getting the rice, just right in the oven, mine was still too firm after more than an hour of cooking. I'll definitely try it again and see if I can get it right.

To save on cooking time in the oven and make sure rice gets cooked through, i cooked the basmati rice in a rice cooker first. I added about 1 cup of the broth to the rice mixture. I also used 1 can stewed tomatoes. Used italian sausage instead of chroizo. I also soaked the saffron in 1tsp of warm water before adding.  Put all mixture in a large baking dish, and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  I did not have peas or clams, but i added a cup of stir fried snap peas and put them on top of the Paella before serving.  Will try his reciep again, and add 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp paprika

I made this in the dutch oven while camping - all in one pot.  I doubled the shrimp and added a little cayenne (I used mild chorizo).  It was delicious!  It serves way more than six though.  I fed six hungry adults (some took thirds) and a handful of kids, and we had leftovers.

This was my first time with this recipe. I made some changes, and would make it this way again.

Added clam juice, diced bell pepper, paprika, Tony Chachere's seasoning, and 2 tablespoons fresh parsley to the onions. Left out the tomatoes due to a sensitivity. Only needed about half the flour when dredging the chicken.

I baked Arborio rice and non-meat ingredients for an hour at 300 degrees. Then I added the browned chicken and sausage. After 10 minutes, I added the peas, large shrimp and drained canned whole clams because I was worried about overcooking them. Baked 10 more minutes. Everything came out perfectly cooked. 

I made 1.5 times the recipe, which was enough to serve about 11 people.

Here's my pic! I forgot the peas and had to pull it out of the oven to add them! Really glad I cooked everything first before baking it. Cooked the rice in the chicken broth and then only added one more cup on top of the whole casserole dish.  The shrimp were the only thing not cooked first, and I think the layer of peas prevented them from over cooking.

This is a very good and easy paella recipe which reminds me of my grandmother's recipe.  I used authentic Spanish chorizo de Bilbao which really makes a big difference in this dish.  Other additions were lean bacon and instead of mussels I used frozen calamari rings that I thawed and added towards the end of cooking.  I didn't use peas but replaced it with green beans like my grandmother's.  A note on the amount of broth though.  I think it all depends on the kind of rice you use.  Some varieties would require less than some so I would add less initially and then add if lacking.  I also used a paella pan and just cooked it on top of the stove instead of the oven covered in foil.  Oh and instead of chicken breasts I used bone in chicken thighs.  My grandmother used boneless chicken thighs which ensured that the chicken will stay moist.  Also I think dredging the chicken in flour prior to frying is unnecessary.

tasty, no clam juice - used extra chicken broth and andouille susage instead of chorizo.  Added broth towards the end.

I love that I could make this in the  oven in a big roasting pan vs a paella pan (I doubled the recipe).  I just checked it every 20 minutes, added more broth if it looked dry and cooked it probably for about an hour in total.  I did use Arborio rice which made it more creamy than traditional paella, but I liked it much better this way. I also didn't add the shrimp and added scallops until 15 minutes before taking it out as it seemed like putting them in for an hour would dry them out.  Guests devoured it.

This recipe turned out excellent.  I also added scallops, clams, & crab meat.  I also took the advice of one of the comments and used clam juice and then added the broth.  Instead of baking it, I used a dutch oven on the stovetop.  Awesome recipe.  Family loved it!

The dish looked beautiful and tasted delicious! I wish it would have came out a little bit more dry, so next time I will add 1/4-1/2 less broth. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of knorr chicken bouillon (not the cubes) and a sprinkle of sea salt to the actual rice. My fam loved it!
