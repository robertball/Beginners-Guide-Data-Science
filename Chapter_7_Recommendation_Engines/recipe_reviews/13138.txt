I liked it, but it needed more flavor. I added, a lot of pepper (no salt), Old Bay Seasoning, a couple of dashes of tabasco and worchestire. I would suggest not pureeing the meat with the rest of the soup.

I made this bisque for a special treat for my family. Everybody just loved it! Im not sure if I did something wrong but in my opinion it was more like a soup than a bisque. Even after adding the cream it wasnt creamy. Regarless, everyone had seconds and I will be making this dish again!

I was expecting a more creamier soup, like bisque usually is.  I added cornstarch to thicken it and also used a little Old Bay Seasoning.  Otherwise it would not have enough flavor.  I don't think I'll make this again.  Kind of an expensive soup.

Cooking the whole tails added wonderful flavour. I substituted 1/4 cup of brandy for the white wine, added an extra cup of cream, and thickened with cornstarch to get the thick texture. The bisque was delicate, delightful, and really highlighted the taste of the lobster.

Though I followed the recipe, I found this to be less flavorful than I would have liked. It would have also been helpful to know the preferred size of lobster tails to use. Mine were on the small side, so I added extras, but still found there to be too little lobster meat in the finished soup.  I ended up adding extra seasoning to this recipe.

I was leery when I read about blending it, then I remember why when I did it, hot liquid and blenders make a mess the first hit of the button.  Besides that I did add some old bay seasoning, frank's hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and pepper.  I used crab meat and also added some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  Tasted great, but the one mess with the blender was a turn off.    So good recipe, but do the blending in small batches.

I followed the recipe, just added less broth.  But still it didn't come out creamy like I expected.  Husband and grandson liked it though.

thinner than expected. i did not buy tails instead i bought pre packaged frozen lobster meat (waaaaay cheaper ans a good amount) and once thawed i added the juice in and added the meat closer to being done. with some salt and pepper it had decent flavor, i also added extra butter. Everyone loved it!!!!

Made exactly as written and the only thing it needs is just a bit more thickness. Next time I'll add a potato with the other veggies and blend it in before adding the meat & cream.

Terrific soup!  I made it a bit different. Tripled the tomatoes, added cajun seasoning (teaspoon 1), red wine (1cup), old bay seasoning (teaspoon 1) and only three lobster. Then let it simmer for two hours with shells in soup. The extra simmer time adds to the lobster flavor. Then we added in the lobster meat once the soup was served so it wouldn’t over cook/ get tough. These were my instructions from my 10 yr old daughter. It’s now the favorite soup of our family and friends. Thank you!

It was good but not creamy enough. I added 8 ounces of cream cheese.

I thought this was great.  Like others, I did make a few tweaks:  I added a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce, and a tsp of Old Bay (Made a 1/2 batch, 2 servings).  I was working with only 1 leftover lobster tail, so I added a can of shrimp near the beginning, that ended up getting puréed, and some shrimp with the lobster at the end.  I did not cook the tails in the soup, as that's not a great method.  Instead, I used some of the chicken stock to steam the tail (and the shrimp), and then added that stock back to to the soup, with it's extra flavor.  Came our luscious - thick and creamy, with excellent flavor.

Delicious!   I amended for a smaller portion and used evaporated milk rather than cream as that is what I had on hand. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I also add Old Bay seasoning, Tomato sauce , MoJo Seasoning, and cooking cherry to this recipe. But only use a 1/4  to 1/2 cup  of cooking cherry  at the end, It's easy to  add too much. I also cut up the lobster meat, removing the outer skin of the lobster and put that through a food processor, as the skin is what is tough. & leave the white lobster meat chunky. Being a long time scuba diver I always use more lobster than what is recommended.  This soup/bisque is the best soup I've ever made, as well as the most expensive!!
 But Everyone loves it!!

Nice flavour!  It does not have the consistency of a bisque - much more like a chowder.  Might try to add some extra vegetables next time, to improve the texture.  Will make again!  Maybe reduce the wine, as it is a bit over powering.

Well I got a little thrown off by the distraction of repeatedly over-filling my mini-prep plus cuisinart in the purée stage, hence requiring a sad cleanup. I served the remainder but in distraction, forgot the cream. It was more of a soup than a bisque. Still tasty. I added the cream to the remaining leftovers and wow! I'll definitely give it a second go. Thanks, author for the recipe!

I've made this recipe several times.  It is great.  I save lobster shells from previous meals and throw them all in the pot with the 4 or 5 5oz tails I buy.  Then just pull the meat, throw away the shells and finish the dish.  I cut up the meat and put back in bisque, I don't puree the meat in the blender.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a good starting point . Plain enough where you can put your own mark on it quite easily and make it awesome .  Substituted a dry sherry for the white wine .  Used canned diced tomatoes  instead of chopped tomatoes .  Definitely needed extra salt  and pepper . Added  Cayanne pepper . Used a seafood blend  instead of lobster  and added green onions .
