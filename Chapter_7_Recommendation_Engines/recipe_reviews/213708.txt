I changed it up a bit. I went with 3 chile peppers, 1 serrano, and 1 habanero instead of the 4 serranos. I also added about 1/3 cup of sour cream and a tablespoon of lemon juice.  It's wonderful, but not for the faint of heart

This was okay but I really thought we would like it more than we did. It wasn't bad on our tacos when melded with all of the other ingredients but on it's own we didn't care for it. I only used two serranos but wish I'd added all four. My problem isn't that it was too mild though, it's the actual flavor.

Very Good! I made this exactly per the recipe and thought it was good, but a little spicy. I added an extra tomatillo and a little garlic powder, lemon juice and water, and that made it a 5-star for me. Used it on cicken flautas made from here.

This was good, but I had to add a little extra to even out the flavor. We added lime and 1 extra avocado because the chiles were so spicy. Also, my hubby thinks we should have added an onion, so maybe next time. Overall, good and I will make again.

Really good and spicy. I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and added onion, sour cream, a splash of lemon and lime juice, a teaspoon of minced garlic, and a little fajita seasoning.

How can something so simple taste so good. Four serrano chiles were just right. They only change I made was using garlic salt to taste in place of regular salt. Next time I will add onion. This will go into my TNT folder.

Very good, I had this as a dip with chips first and then added some lime juice and 1/2 extra avocado to make as a dressing for a bean salad. Went over very well with the family and I've no doubt will be a tasty taco topping. Thanks for sharing!

My 9 year old daughter is in love with this dip.  Thank goodness our garden produces a never-ending supply of tomatillas!  We ramp up the heat with jalapeno peppers.

This was a good baseline recipe, but i added a lot to it to give it the flavor needed for me. 
I used half jalape√±o half serrano, then I added a quarter of an onion, two cloves of garlic, lime, salt, and a little more cilantro than called for. 
My mixture came out pretty chunky so I added a 1/4 cup of water. 
After this the salsa was a good texture and good spice level, very delicious!

I'd give it 5 stars, but found it so much better with the added onion, garlic, lime juice and sour cream added as per other reviews. Awesome base, though!

Amazingly good. The tomatillos I had were pretty large, so I only put in 5 to 2 avocados. I also only used 2 serrano peppers, but I threw them in whole without de-seeding them. I added a clove of garlic and boy, was this yummy!

This is very similar to my recipe. I add onion, salt, and garlic powder. I also use about 6 entire serrano chilies. We love very spicy salsa.
