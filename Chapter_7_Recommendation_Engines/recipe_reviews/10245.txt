This is a thousand dollar recipe, I've been looking for something like this for awhile! However, I did make a few modifications to make it more whole grain and wonderfully delicious. I subbed the 1 3/4 cups of flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup oat flour, then cut the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar (someone on here thought it was too sweet). I also used only 2.5 cups of rolled oats, as that was all that I had left. Another tip - put your cookie dough in the fridge for 1 hour before you start to bake it and use a small icecream scooper to form the cookies on your cookie sheet. It tasted wonderfully chewy, rich and perfectly sweet. It reminded me of the Double Tree Chocolate Chip cookies they used to give out at their hotel, but better because I used all organic ingredients and absolutely no preservatives. Yummy!

Greatest cookie recipe ever!
I substitute milk chocolate for semi-sweet morsals and use sweetened coconut.  Sorry, not a fan of nuts so I leave them out.  12 minutes @ 350 degrees gives them a slightly crispy outside and leaves the inside chewy.

AWESOME cookies.  My husband, who likes crispy cookies, and I, who like 'gooey' cookies, both loved these. Great even without nuts.  The coconut added great texture without an over-powering flavor.

I am Woody and since I first posted this recipe I have made a few minor changes and would like to share them with you.  Here they are: 

Add 1/2 cup more coconut. 
Try using pecans, just a better tasting cookie
Any flavor chip can be substituted but CHOCOLATE CHUNKS ARE BEST. 

Tips for a great cookie!

In a large bowl, cream together the SOFT butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. 
Slowly pour/mix in the beaten eggs , milk and vanilla. 

Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. 
Stir in oats then chocolate chips then nuts and finally the coconut until all is distributed.

 Drop by rounded balls onto ungreased cookie sheet....See tip below! ***
 Bake 12 to 15 minutes on middle rack of oven for a chewy cookie.... See tip below! ***

Cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet and then remove to wire rack. Cool completely and then store in tightly sealed container.

*** Use ice cream scoop slightly rounded to make 22-24 cookies. Making 22-24 is important......This will insure they will be nice and thick and stay chewy  for days.

*** Keep a second cookie pan cooled in the refrigerator and alternate between batches.
While cooking first batch, roll all of the remaining balls and keep them chilled as well. This will prevent your cookies from spreading out too much & becoming flat and crispy.

Balls can be kept in the fridge for several days to be cooked later.
Rolled balls can also be wrapped in plastic and frozen to be later th

These are fantastic cookies. I made 2 slight changes. I sifted the flour/salt/baking soda before adding (using a mesh strainer-easy). Used less sugar to account for sweetened coconut: 1/4 c. white, 1 c. brown sugar. And I ADDED 1 TSP LEMON JUICE so they would be chewy. This gives a nice even texture. You can't taste the lemon at all. These are the best textured oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.

Oh YUM!  My new favorite cookie.  My only changes: only had 3/4 c butter, so I added 1/4 c shortening, I also added another cup of coconut, and used 1 1/2 c of dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  My young boys and I prefer dark over semi-sweet, and also added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Then I refriderated for 1 hour.  These cookies are hard to mix my hand, but my beautiful BOSCH mixer with cookie paddles made lite work of it.  The dough was a little hard to make "stick" together.  I rolled 1 1/2 inch dough balls and baked at 350 degrees for 11 min. with the first dozen, then 14 min. with the 2nd dozen.  My convection oven is right on target with the lower cooking times with most recipes.  The first dz was, I thought, a little undercooked, but turned out fine after it cooled completely.  The 2nd dz at 14 min. was better though.  They made full (not flat) 2 1/2 - 3 inch cookies.  They were rich and flavorful.  I saved the other half of the dough in the freezer for later. I may actually cut back on the chocolate chips next time, only b/c a 12 oz bag was more than enough, quantity and richness wise.  My sons beg to differ, however.  Thanks for this great recipe.  My search is over!

These are very hearty cookies!  I told a co-worker I would make him any cookie he wanted for his birthday, and he said, "how about oatmeal butterscotch coconut macadamia nut?"  I made a few alterations that I think worked out well.   Since I already had some sweetened flaked coconut to use, I decided to cut out the white sugar completely from the ingredients since I'd read some reviews earlier saying the cookies were too sweet.  Seemed sweet enough to me since in addition to the coconut, I was using a mix of chocolate & butterscotch chips and chopped chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.  The only other adjustment I made was to put in a 3/4 cup wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  This made it a bit heartier of a cookie and hopefully a little healthier.  With my first batch, 375 seemed to get the cookies a bit darker than I'd hoped (I like them a little crunchy on the outside and chewy inside), so I started baking for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees (2 pans at a time, switching racks @ 10 minutes) and was happier with the results.  Awesome!

These cookies are chewy, moist and very tasty. I added 1 t. coconut extract and chopped pecans instead of the walnuts. But no kidding, I never make any other cookies anymore. Excellent recipe, it is always a hit whenever I make them.

5+ stars! Made this to fix a craving I had for all the goodies that were in these but I wanted to eat them in bar/cake form so I made these into bar cookies!  just followed recipe as is and added a dash of grated nutmeg, then spread out in a sprayed 9x13 baking dish and baked for about 23 minutes I think or until the toothpick came out without any goo on it!  There will be some melted chocolate but that's ok, you just don't want the cake part under-done.  Oh yea, I also used half semi-sweet choc. chips and half milk chocolate.  Next time I will only use the milk choc. the taste and "gooey-ness" was awesome with the bigger chip and in my opinion tastier.  My hubby loved as well and he's not a fan of this kind of thing. I did manage to eat almost the entire thing alone within a week..sshhh, don't tell anybody! :-) Try the bar style you'll be glad you did!

This is the best oatmeal cookie ever!!  The coconut adds a moistness and chewiness that other oatmeal cookies lack.  Everyone loves these!  I sometimes vary the chips and nuts.  White chocolate and macadamia nuts or butterscotch chips and pecans are sure crowd pleasers in addition to the traditional semisweet chocolate and walnuts.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Two things: The cookie is great, and I hate to modify recipes the first time, but I just couldn't bear to put in a whole cup of butter, with my daughter trying to lose weight and my cholesterol too high. Several reviewers also mentioned that the coconut flavor was too mild, and I happened to have a jar of virgin coconut oil (firm, same texture and use as butter, but much healthier), so I used half butter, and half coconut oil.  Cookie not only came out perfect but it had the extra coconut flavor it needed and that I love. The recipe didn't say what type of brown sugar to use, so I used dark brown. Otherwise, recipe made as written. I used unsweetened coconut, so I did add all the sugar as stated in the recipe. To make them look pretty, however, instead of dropping them on a baking sheet, I used a two tablespoon scoop and smoothed the edges so they weren't shaggy. (I got 66 cookies, and 11 to 12 minutes worked for me, but ladies, no need for times. Everyone's oven bakes differently. What may be a great time for you and me, could still be raw or even overdone for someone else. So we really shouldn't ever state that someone else should bake them a certain time, because that time was good for your oven.) Anyway, the cookies came out picture pretty, and nice and thick and looked and tasted great.

Ok, just made these (eating one now!).. They are incredible. I have an oatmeal raisin cookie addict for a fianc√© and have had a hard time finding a truely chewy dough recipe... He took one bite and said "this is it!". I followed the recipe exactly, including allowing the butter to soften just by sitting on the counter. I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips, and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each nutmeg and ground cloves. If I could give more than 5 stars I would! They are outstanding. I baked mime for 11 minutes at 350, and they are really chewy as promised. Give them a try & you won't be disappointed. Oh, on a side note, I noticed a lot of reviewers saying that their dough was difficult to stir but I didn't encounter this problem at all. My cookies are a bit on the flat side, but it doesn't bother me at all.

The greatest cookie of all time. Thanks Woody!  My dad makes them several times a year. I always stand next to him when he cooks and I get anything that drops on the floor. He even gives me a big chunk when my brothers and sister are not watching.

These cookies were AMAZING fresh out of the oven! they lasted for that day and tasted good the next day but unlike many cookie recipes these cookies did not get better with age after the second day although they still had good flavor, they were very hard and not good. a good make and serve in the same day recipe, not make a week ahead of time Christmas cookie!

This cookie is yummy!! The only changes I made were to bake at 350 for 11 minutes and added a tsp of coconut extract. I did not add nuts since the taste tends to overpower the other flavors in a cookie.    I cooled the batter and baked them on a silpat sheet and parchment. The ones baked on the silpat did not spread as much as the ones baked on parchment. Both were chewy with crisp edges.   This recipe is a keeper!

Yum!  I have made this twice.  Once, I didnt have eggs so I used Ener-G egg replacer and it was better than the recipe that actually had eggs in it, although both were fantastic.  My friends wont stop going on and on about this recipe.  Here's what I did different: Used all brown sugar, but only totalling 1 1/2 cups; used ener-g egg replacer, used organic old fashioned oats (2 cups oats and 1 cup I pulverized into oat flour in the blender); used all organic flour; used mixture of dark chocolate chips and bittersweet chips.    With these modifications, this is the best chocolate chip recipe EVER!!!  Just make sure that you DO NOT OVER-BAKE these cookies.  If you do just so you will have a fantastic, better-than-bakery quality, lacey, delicate, soft, yet crispy cookie.  :)

These were good! I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any at home. Next time I'll add a bit more vanilla.
For those who are ending up with flat cookies, put the batter in the fridge before baking. It hardens the butter and leaves you with fantastic high cookies :)

These are great cookies. I made these because I wanted to use up some oatmeal and coconut, but may have found a reason to buy more! My friend and his son were crazy about them (and they can both be very picky). I used sweetened coconut because that is what I had (it was a very mild coconut flavor). Also used a mixture of semisweet, bittersweet, and milk chocolate chips to use up some old bags. Pecans instead of walnuts for the same reason. I love recipes that call for regular rolled oats because they are so full of healthy fiber. These were chewy and moist and addictive. The perfect texture. Can't wait to try them with regular coconut so they won't be as sweet. Thanks!!.......Just wanted to add that I took these to culinary school one day and the professors LOVED them. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips that time.

These were just ok.  Mine came out completely flat and crispy even though i cooked them exactly at the right temp and time.  Perhaps they should be cooked at 350?  also disappointingly you couldn't really taste the coconut.  Someone else mentioned using coconut extract and that's probably a good idea.  Otherwise these were a run of the mill fancy chocolate chip cookie.

I specifically chose this recipe because of the coconut. My husband loves coconut but I am not a big fan and figured they would not be a temptation for me. I am happy to say I was wrong about that... they are delicious! I used a small "cookie scoop" and got 6 dozen cookies. Baked them for 8 minutes. Omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any. Thanks!

Very good recipe! I used slivered almonds, instead of walnuts. I liked the consistency of the coconut, but I think the chocolate chips overpowered the coconut. Next time I'll use more coconut and/or less chocolate chips. But overall, a delicious recipe!

All time best cookie recipe.  I only made a couple changes per other reviewers suggestions.  Since the chocolate chips, raisins and coconut are really sweet, I cut the sugars from 1 1/4 cups brown sugar to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar.  Also, rather than 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips I added 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I baked them at 350 for 14 min.  Perfection!  Thank you for this recipe.

Pretty good. For my taste, I would reduce the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups, as I feel the chocolate taste overwhelms all the others, and I would increase the coconut by 1/2 cup, as I was really having a hard time identifying that. Thanks!

It's a great recipe overall as it produces a good oatmeal cookie. You can tweak the ratio of the add ins like the chocolate and coconut (omitted the nuts) to suit your tastes. I would recommend keeping the total volume of the add ins the same.

My own changes:
-used 1.5 sticks of butter
-chilled the dough for 30 mins (or overnight even) to produce a chubbier cookie

These remained chewy well after baking! Loved these! I used a medium scoop to place them on cookie sheets which gave them a "store bought" uniformed look. I also omitted the walnuts. They looked great and tasted great! Will definitely make these again.

Excellent recipe! The variations are endless.

I reduced the oatmeal to 2 cups, reduced chocolate chips to 1 cup (1/2 milk & 1/2 white chocolate chips), added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup of ground flax seed, 1/2 cup craisins, 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp chopped orange peel, substituted coconut sugar instead of white sugar, pure vanilla extract - not the artificial stuff,  and substituted pecans for walnuts.

My kids love them!

A deliciously substantial cookie with a fantastic combination of flavors and just the right amount of sweetness.  I love the texture -- a little crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  I used pecans in place of the walnuts.  I made these today to send out for Christmas, but I think I'm going to have to make another batch...

Good recipe... Only thing I had to change was the cook time. 12 minutes was way too long and the bottoms came out burnt... 8 minutes was plenty of time for the next batch.

These were very good and very addicting! I loved the chewy texture and the combination of flavors. I did make one change; I completly cut out the white sugar. Even without the white sugar they were still very sweet.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, a bit less sugar, no nuts (will use pecans or macadamias next time), white chips & added 1/2tsp coconut extract. Swapped-out 1/2C of the flour for wheat. I also used a 1/3C scoop for 20 big, lovely cookies, dough in fridge in between (late batches spread less than earliest). 14m in the oven (so centers look a tad underdone), 3 min carryover on the pan. SO YUMMY! Only drawback is I couldn‚Äôt enjoy them warm as centers weren‚Äôt done. But completely cool they‚Äôre nice & chewy in the center w/crisp, tender edges. WOW!

I changed it based on what I had on hand, but even if I followed the recipe exactly, I think my rating would have been the same.  I used margarine, 1 cup of oats (bumping the flour up a bit to compensate), a little over 1 cup of coconut.  I have one vote of "awesome" and one vote of "really good", but both DH and I thought they were a bit too sweet and really could have used less sugar.  Otherwise, though, a really nice chewy tasty cookie and helped me use up some ingredients.

Made exactly per recipe... very good & chewy!
Made these again & used .75 scoop (about 1-2/3 tbsp).  This recipe made 60 cookies of this size... 
I used mini chocolate chips & pecans this time; excellent!

I was given the task of making a dessert for our annual Christmas eve celebration so I chose these cookies. I followed the directions to the T and BOY WERE THEY A HIT!  I opted to add the Walnuts and as good as they tasted by including them, I feel that omitting them wouldn't do the cookie any justice at all.  They added a crunch factor and that coupled with the chewyness of the coconut, made them simply divine.  I also liked how the recipe only called for 1 cup of chocolate chips because I feel that any more than that would have overpowered the taste of the cookie.  VERY GOOD RECIPE. I WILL make these again.

I thought my kids wouldn't like oatmeal cookies.  I was wrong.  :)  First batch was made with cranberries and chocolate chips.  Second batch with coconut and chocolate chips.  This cookie is quite sweet so I measured the sugar scantly the second time around.  Baked at 350 deg for 7 minutes and then switched the trays around for another 7 mins.  Perfect!

I made these today and they came out awesome! I only had 2 1/2 cups of oatmeal, no coconut and no vanilla (substituted rum flavor).  My husband kept on sneaking them and saying "oh yeah, these are keepers" so they passed his taste test - and that's saying something since he's not much of a cookie eater.  This is the first time I can remember (in 15 years together) that he's stolen cookies as I made them.

Very easy, very delicious, and a yummy twist on a basic cookie.  Made them for an informal get together on short notice, and wanted something other than the usual chocolate chip or oatmeal.  The coconut becomes the missing link between the best of both worlds resulting in a very quiet room (As everyone was devouring them).  This is a keeper recipe for sure!

Excellent recipe.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and reduced white sugar to 1/4 c. due to sweetened coconut.  I also reduced cooking time to 9 minutes for a nice chewy center.  Perfection!

Made these as written except:  sub'd whole wheat flour for half the AP flour, and left out the nuts as I didn't have any on hand.  I did put the batter in the fridge for an hour before baking and I always use a small disher and parchment paper when I bake these type cookies.  

They held their shape very well and they have a nice texture.  Not overly sweet - just right!

These might be the best cookies I've ever made.  Yummy!  I followed the directions as given except I left out the salt.  I did use salted butter.  My husband loves these.  They have something for everyone in them!

Superb!! These were simple to make, and absolutely delicious.  Even my children loved them.  They are very rich though.  I did cut the white sugar down a bit to probably 1/3 cup, and I used milk chocolate chips.

I've been trying to duplicate a recipe for some cookies from a local bakery that are to die for!  This recipe was a great base, but it still needed something.  I added 1 cup of raisins along with milk chocolate chips and black walnuts.  I also reduced the brown sugar by about a 1/4 cup since I ran out.  The cookies taste really good, but they aren't as sweet as I'd like and kind of bland.  Don't get me wrong, they taste okay, but you need some kind of flavoring or spice to bring the blend the different ingredients together.    Next time, I may add a tablespoon of instant coffee along with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

Very good! My husband loved them. I used dark chocolate chips and the flavor was a little overpowering, so I may scale back to semi-sweet or use less next time. I would definitely make the recipe again though. Be prepared for a huge batch. This made about 7 1/2 dozen for me.

This cookie recipe is seriously delicious. Everyone loved it the first time I made it, and by now I have made many times. I have changed the quantity of oatmeal before to 2 and a half cups and it was still as delicious, chewy, and soft. These cookies have a variety of flavors and texture all at once, especially when add walnuts/pecans to it too. I recommend this to anyone. It's the perfect snack to have around for anytime of the day or with your tea. But don't get yourself too attached to them, we all know why. :)

Wow!  What a yummy cookie.  I'm sure as written it is every bit as good as the version that I prepared.  I substituted Callebut white chocolate chunks (10 ounces) for the chocolate chips.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and reduced the amount of white sugar to 1/4 cup.  I think this cookie may have moved to the top of my favorite cookie list!

Ok so I'm reviewing late. Made these cookies for Christmas and they were wonderful! I used white chocolate chips as I was already making chocolate chip cookies, and as I already said, they were wonderful. Would definitely make them again. Maybe next time I will use chocolate chips...or maybe butterscotch? The possibilities are endless...lol!

WOW!! Didnt change a thing other than cooking times and temperature. Delissssshhh. They looked gorgeous too! Nice and chewy.. not thin, and crunchy like others stated. I put the dough on the cookie sheet with a small ice cream scoop. I didnt flatten it at all. I cooked at 360 for probably about 7 minutes then, on low broil for 2-3 minutes. PERFECT~

Amazing cookies! 10 mins bake time was just perfect, no more is needed. Even though the nuts are optional I would recommend adding as they help to break up the sweetness of the cookie.

I baked at 365 F for 14 min and the cookies where perfect. I also used a mixture of chocolate, white and butterscotch chips to make a total of 2c. and pecans instead of walnuts and cut the brown sugar back to 1c because I used fancey coconut (could have probably cut the white sugar in half also. I also added 1/2tsp of coconut extract (as suggested in the reviews). 
These cookies are delicious, this receipe is a keeper!

These remind me a little of Monster cookies except with coconut. They come out crispy and chewy on inside. Not sure what the difference of rolled oats to regular oats, but finally found the rolled oats. If you like coconut, these are a must! Makes a lot of cookies and easy to cut in half if need be. I left the nuts out as well.

Good recipe.  Here are my modifications (half recipe): 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar,  1/2 cup margarine, and 1/2 cup sweetened coconut.  Bake the cookies at 350F for 12 minutes.

Delicious!!! I cut the recipe in half and got 44 cookies. I sub'd egg white for the egg and sub'd less than 1/4 cup whole wheat flour in place of equal amount of AP flour. Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips too. Wonderful texture ... lightly crisp on outside and soft on inside. Really yum!

AMAZING!  I added 1 cup of dried cranberries, reduced the amount of sugar and added lemon juice (as another reviewer suggested) and these are seriously the best cookies I have ever had.  They were gone in a matter of 2 days and I already have a request to make more.

Scrumptious! Made as a bar cookie with some homemade jam sandwiched in the middle. Baked at 375 for 20 min. Delish!

Tastes just like an almond joy bar!  I left out the white sugar because I only had sweetened coconut.  Also (IMHO) the salt is crucial!

Very tasty oatmeal-chocolate chip cookie, but I was hoping for more coconut I guess. I added a touch of coconut extract - maybe a tsp? - but I think I'd need a Tbsp to get any noticeable flavor. The cooking time was spot on for me; 12 minutes produced a soft cookie with a golden brown bottom. I will probably tweak this recipe a bit to enhance the coconut flavor (perhaps sub coconut oil for some/all of the butter), but it's a lovely recipe as is.

Just as good as everyone said they were. I would cook at 350 for 14 minutes the chips can burn fast. For a more Oatmeal cookie taste omit or cut down on chips.

Amazing!! I made these cookies this week-end for our New year's day celebration. They were loved by everyone. They are so chewy because of the coconut. I made one batch with walnuts and one without. I preferred the ones without. I did cook them at 375 for 12 minutes. They were perfect. This will be my official oatmeal cookie recipe.

I had to give it 3 stars for kids because I have a 1 year old who wouldnt be able to chew the coconut or nutsn this recipe.  Very easy to make, although the way things are mixed is somewhat of a pain, which is why I gave it a 4 for quickness.  Overall it tastes good...but there seems to be something missing.  I only baked 1 dozen, refridgerated the rest of the batter...I am going to try figuring out what it's missing later when my child is in bed!

Delicious!  I made the cookie base as written and added in white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, cherries and berries, pecans, and the coconut.  Next time I may try some orange zest and sub some lemon or orange juice for the milk in the base just to see what happens.

I made this recipe after cutting the ingredients in half. I used 1tbsp of evaporated milk. Not even sure why milk is called for. I added chopped peanuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, unsweetened coconut flakes & chocolate chips into 1 cup alternating until the cup is full. The times suggested in the recipe was accurate. This is officially the ‚Äúmy cookie‚Äù recipe. My son: oatmeal chocolate chip. This one is mine. Highly recommend this recipe. Thank you to the author.

I thought these were excellent -- loved the texture.  I had a butter-flavored Crisco bar I needed to use so I used instead of butter and added 2 extra TBSP milk.  Actually, used half and half because that's what I had.  Only had a cup of semi-sweet chips.  Baked in convection mode so reduced heat 25 degrees and baked 8 minutes on bottom shelf and 2 on top and they browned up and were perfectly chewy.  I used a  small ice cream scoop and ended up with 48 gorgeous cookies.  Per Woody's update I will add a little more coconut next time and hopefully will have a whole bag of chips!

This is my new favorite cookie. My wife found this recipe on here and she decided to try it out.  This is our go to cookie recipe now. We follow the recipe with the exception of only putting in 1/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of white chocolate. We also put in about 1/2 cup more oats. We have put in either walnuts, cashews, or pecans, depending on what we had at the time of making them. Amazing.

Oh my gosh!  These are THE most delicious cookie I have ever eaten!  Easy to make.  I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but I only had one stick of butter so used that along with 1/2 cup Crisco shortening.   That was the only change I made.  The cookies came out so good; soft, moist, chewy on the inside and a bit crispy on the outside.  Bet you can't eat just one!  :)

I have made this recipe twice. Each time it came out great. I even used a little less brown sugar (1 cup) and white sugar (1/4 cup). I also saved some batter without chocolate chips and added craisins ( because I love oatmeal cookies with raisins or craisins , not chocolate ). Everyone liked them. I'll make them over and over again.

So good! Great, hearty texture. So hearty, that I ate only one per sitting. Chewy, not crunchy. Just perfect. I added 50% more coconut and switched to pecans, per Woody's changes. You must try!

Sorry Mom, best cookie ever!!  Some mods:  Unsweetened coconut; coconut "extract" (1t); white chocolate chunks in place of dark chocolate; dried cranberries (1C); sub macadamia nuts; sometimes some Demerara or cane sugar crystals (a bit subtler sweetness) sub equal for white sugar.  OK a lot of mods, pick and choose, but the real beauty of this recipe is that it is (as many have noted) both chewy and crispy no matter which mods you choose!  Really neat. Who knew?!  I always have some dough in the freezer. Thanks.

Instead of the coconut, chocolate chips & nuts, I used  a 12oz bag of white chips, 1 1/2 c. dried cranberries and 3/4 c.walnuts.  Made them much smaller than some have suggested-used a level Tbsp. (#50 scoop). Baked 375 for 10-12 min, depended on cookie sheets used (dark vs. lt. or airbake) if they were more chewy or crunchy.  I may have to make another batch to make it through Christmas. (yum)

Yumm!!! I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but the are really good cookies. I made 1/2 a batch and still got 30 good size cookies. I was nearly out of butter, so I substituted butter flavor crisco with excellent results. I also used pecans in place of walnuts ( out of walnuts). These cookies have a good texture from the oatmeal and coconut without either being overwhelming flavors.....thanks for the recipe!

This cookie has become my favorite go to recipe whenever we want homemade cookies. I have made these several times exactly as originally written as well as  using Woody's suggestions (add extra cocoanut and substitute pecans for walnuts). I have also made them with raisins. Each time the cookies get rave reviews.

A million dollar recipe! I made these recently after a long break. My husband said, "Oh, I forgot how good these are!" These are the perfect cookies. Never use margarine, only butter. My only change: I use butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips." Be brave and try it. It goes wonderfully with the coconut and oatmeal.

I love these cookies they are now my favourite and they were a hit with all who ate them. They are definitely a new family favourite.   I froze some dough so my granddaughters could add some sprinkles to there's. We did them today and they turned out great

My new favorite this is a great recipe.  Refrigeration is key though I found at least 1 hour most helpful.  These cookies are the perfect softness the next day too.  I have been looking for a good soft oatmeal cookie recipe for years.  I am trying raisins this go around.  I made no changes the first batch.  I found it important to watch them carefully towards the end if you cook them too long they get hard.

These cookies are delicious! I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and 2.5 cups of rolled oats instead of 3. I only had half a cup of semisweet mini chocolate chips so that's all I used. They still came out chocolatey enough though. I also didn't use the baking soda, salt, or any nuts. I rolled the batter into balls with my own hands and they still held their shape so I flattened them after they rested for a minute. These are truly delicious, you must try them if you like chewy cookies! I baked my first batch for 14 min at 350 and then my other two for 10 and 12 minutes at 375. They were all chewy but I did notice my first batch was lighter. All in all, give these a try.

This is my go-to cookie recipe, I LOVE it! However, a detail I change that makes a HUGE impact on the cookies is cook them at 350 for 10-12 minutes NOT 375! At 375 they come out super dry and unimpresive, at 350 they are little lumps of deliciousness.

WOW!!!  I rarely review recipes I try, but this one by far has been my favorite.  The only change I made was to use milk chocolate versus semisweet because that's all I had.  I initially used 375 and felt they were a little dark on the edges, so I switched to 350 and baked for 14 minutes.  Overall, I love how these cookies are a combination of chewy and crispy.  I felt they were sweet, but not too sweet, and had that hint of salt taste you get with a Tollhouse cookie.  I also liked how the coconut wasn't overwhelming, especially for those non-coconut lovers (who are you?).  Yum!

I made them as directed. No substitutions. They were great and very hardy. I couldn't really taste the coconut so I would leave that out next time. Also, this recipe makes way too much cookies. Next time, I will cut the recipe by half. My cookies stuck to cookie sheet so the next batch I used parchment paper.

I am a very amateur dessert baker but these turned out very well and were delicious.  I had better luck with the ones baked on an air-bake cookie sheet rather than single layer.

Nice, versatile recipe. Cut the sugar- even with unsweetened coconut the cookie is too sweet. But I suppose that's the way some like it!

WOW! The other reviews were right! This does take like the hotels from the Doubletree Inn! Yum! I only had 2 1/2 cups of oats, about 3/4 cup of pecans and almonds mixed together. I used dark chocolate chips, too. I just had a bite of the first one and I had to write a review. YUM! They turned out picture perfect and that is rare for me--I'm not such a great baker, but these were easy to make with my daughter and turned out perfectly. I cooked mine for 10 minutes and that was perfect for crispy outside and a soft center.

I just made these cookies and they were soooo yummy,  crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I did make a few adjustments.  I used self-rising flour and eliminated the baking soda & salt.  I also only had white chocolate chips and not quite a cup.  I used pecans and broke them up smaller than what they came in the package.  I did use 1/4 cup less white sugar, b/c I used sweetened coconut.  I also added a spiced blend from Pampered Chef, it had cinnamon, nutmeg, ground orange peel, clove and ginger.  I used about a tablespoon.  I put half the mixture in the refrigerator to make later, so wait to see how the chilled dough cooks up.

This recipe pretty much incorporates everything i really wanted in a cookie. I did make a couple changes. Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips i used White Chocolate Chips (I don't really care for "chocolate" chips) and I used macadamia nuts. I also didn't have enough All-purpose flour on hand so i used Bread Flour. I refrigerated my dough for hours prior to use, but 20 minutes would be alright. My oven tends to cook a little fast so i decreased the temperature to 350 and baked them for 8 1/2 minutes on the middle shelf. 
They were wonderful.  I'll have to make them again since my father in law decided to give us three contains of oats he no longer wanted.

Just finished making one batch - very good but something is missing
and I think maybe more coconut and/or use sweetened.  The coconut
flavor was missing and the chips took over.  Mine baked for 12 mins
as one suggested and that was perfect.  I may have put too many chopped walnuts in but all in all they are very good.  Plan to make a double batch next week and I'll do half/half of the coconut - half plain and half sweetened and see how that is.

Great cookie. Will definitely make again. Didn't change a thing to the recipe but I found that 10 mins was too long for chewy cookies. 8 mins was more than enough.

Too dry! I did not overbake but still were very dry. I would try using about a cup less oatmeal if I try again. Disappointed especially after all the great reviews and expensive ingredients used. I make a lot of cookies and have a lot of experience but cant recommend these. I have had better. Too hard and dry.

This cookie was good but I was expecting a richer decadent flavor, I found this cookie a little bland.

Great recipe with so many options for different nuts and fruits!  I did omit the 1/2 cup of white sugar since I used sweetened coconut - we did not miss it at all.  Baked them for exactly 11 minutes and they were golden brown yet still chewy!

Absolutely wonderful!  These are dangerous to have around the house.  Because I used sweetened coconut I cut white sugar to 1/4 cup and brown sugar to 1 cup... Still plenty sweet.  Also omitted salt because I used salted butter.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

Delicious! We ate half and froze half--they were just as good reheated out of the freezer as they were out of the oven.

Makes a big batch. They are much better undercooked than overcooked, so when in doubt, err that way.

My boyfriend loves this recipe and so do I! As someone else mentioned, he loves crunchy cookies and I prefer soft ones, so this is a great way to compromise. I add a little extra coconut and cut down on chocolate chips but that's just my personal preference, nothing to do with the recipe. Also, I always have trouble with these sticking to the cookie sheet so I recommend letting them cool 2-3 minutes and removing them, even though they might seem soft, as long as they don't crumble apart anymore they'll be fine. Otherwise they get too tough and you will break most of them!

Our oven acts up at times, but even though one batch of cookies was slightly overcooked, they still managed to be chewy! This is a great recipe for fast, easy, and delicious cookies. I only used two cups of oats since the dough didn't seem able to encompass all of oats, chocolate chips, and coconut. It's a great combination of flavors. Highly recommended!

First off, these are delicious cookies.  I used Crisco butter flavor shortening instead of butter, I added the salt, I doubled the coconut and omitted the chocolate chips.   However, I had issues with these.  I put the dough in the fridge for an hour before baking.   I baked my first batch at 350 degrees for 10 mins, and that did not work, they were flat and fell apart.   So I recommend 375 degrees.  Then, these stuck to the cookie sheet even with cooking spray which I never use to bake cookies.  Then, I always leave my cookies on the hot sheet for 5 mins out of the oven, but that only left these very flat.  So I then only left them on for 1 min, and although that solved the flat problem, they were too soft to get them nicely off of the pan and to the cooling rack.  Again, a really delicious cookie, I just need to figure out how to make this recipe work for me.  Not sure if it needs the milk, and maybe adding baking powder would help with the shape.  Again with the taste, would love to get this to work.

I made a half batch & got 48 cookies using a tablespoon scooper. I subbed toffee chips for the chocolate chips as these are going to be mailed cross-country and it's too hot for choccy chips now. Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I made 2 pans with only pecans, and the rest I added some choc chips and craisins.  Both were very good.  I used unsalted butter so I added the 1/2 tsp salt.   I will make again for sure.

So delicious.  This recipe makes tons so I just freeze them and use them over a couple of weeks.  These are so good I try to always have them on hand.  When I looked at the batter the first time I thought "this will be way too much rolled oats" but it's the perfect amount.  I'm at altitude (mile high) and I cook these at 375 for 9.5 minutes, then let them sit for a minute, then put them on a cooling rack.  I usually make them without the coconut or walnuts (because I just rarely have those ingredients on hand) and they're still perfect.

The best oatmeal recipe I  have ever tried.  Have been asked for the recipe by all of the school moms & my family. I omit the walnuts due to nut allergies.  I only bake them for 12 minutes (make them with the pampered chef med. scoop - so there are a good size). Very Very Good!!

Delicious cookie and very versatile. I forgot to purchase coconut, and didn't have any chocolate. Instead I added sliced almonds, whole dried cranberries, and an extra cup of oatmeal.  They are now tied with my almond macaroons. In fact, I'm about to make another batch with some variations.

Loved these cookies, as did my guests.  The only change I made was that I swapped in hazelnuts for the walnuts.  A wonderful cookie warm right out of the oven!  I put them as hand-rolled balls onto the baking sheet and they didn't flatten much - this made them a little more cake-like in the centre as they didn't flatten too much, but they were delicious this way!  Will try flatter next time to see whether I like them as much.   I only baked one sheet of cookies (which was gobbled up by my company!).  Will freeze the rest in cookie shape so that I can plop them right onto a baking sheet for fresh-out-of-the-oven goodness any night of the week (danger!).  Super yum, this recipe is a keeper.

EDIT: several delicious batches later, I have made them even better (if possible) by adding 1.5 cups of all natural crunchy peanut butter. I also doubled the baking soda and salt, but will try normal quantities again next time.  TRY WITH PEANUT BUTTER - the most complexly delicious cookie ever.

I made these as directed. The combination of coconut and chocolate reminds me of the Samoa Girl Scout cookie. They were really good! They didn't really change shape at ALL in the oven but they might have just been my oven (it's not very good). Great recipe! I'll make these again!

So delish! I sub'd in 1/2 cup wheat germ for some of the oats for kicks, threw in some chopped, slivered almonds (all I had), and cut out about 1/4 each of the total brown and white sugar. Refrigerated the dough for about half an hour, and used a small cookie scoop to portion them. Made about 3 dozen small but THICK cookies. I'll be lucky if these make it over a week in this household!

Absolutely delicious! My cookies are not even done baking but I couldn't wait to review this recipe. I happened to stumble across this recipe and I am extremely glad that I did! The cookies are soft on the inside but crunchy on the outside- the definitely of a perfect cookie, in my opinion.
I used margarine blocks instead of butter and they turned out great. Highly recommended!

Great Recipe! A friend made cookies very similar to these but used White chocolate, tasted much better then the dark chocolate I used. Just a matter of preference i guess. Only thing I changed was baked them at 365'. I find 350 too low and 375 too high. They turned out great, crispy on the outside and still chewy on the inside!

These cookies turned out great!!  One thing I changed though was, I added about 1/2-3/4 cup of peanut butter.  It added more flavor, and just made the cookies even better for me!

I happened to have all the ingredients lying around cause I just made the Easy Granola Bars a week ago. The only ingredients I was missing to make that recipe were the sweetened condensed milk and the nuts, so thus I made this recipe, to see how it would compare. In essence, these are just a cookie form of that recipe--much richer, because they use butter in place of sweetened condensed milk and softer because they incorporate flour as well as oats. Anything with these combination of ingredients is a winner in my book, but I would say I by far those granola bars because these strike me as a little oily--3/4 c of butter may be a good idea. And make sure to sure in the fridge, in hot days, the greasiness is even more evident. I only used 1.5 c of chocolate, and used only 1/4 c of w sugar as suggested, make sure to do that. I had to use 1 c of raisins in place of the nuts. Over all, I think I would just buy the ff sweetened condensed milk and make those bars instead when a craving hits for this combo of ingredients, my absolute weakness- semisweet chocolate chips, coconut, oats, nuts, and dried cranberries or raisins. And how did anyone end up with 30 cookies? Geeze, those must have been huuggeee.Mine were a decent size, and I got 42!

This is close to a recipe my grandma used to make.  She used golden raisins instead of chocolate chips and they were so good. (Not that I don't love chocolate chips in my cookies!)

These cookies were perfect!  I used all whole wheat flour (white wheat) and they were almost as good as the Kashi dark chocolate oatmeal cookies.  Better because they were considerably cheaper.  The recipe did make a very large batch and did not spread much when baked.  I passed them out to the neighbors and got great reviews!

These cookies were so easy to make and tasted absolutely amazing!!  I used sweetened coconut and left out the white sugar and they were the perfect balance of sweetness. For someone that can't bake at all these were great at making me look like a real baker :)   One note - I used a tablespoon and scooped them out onto the pan and I ended up with about 60 cookies!!

Very good cookies, I added raisins to half to try out a chocolate/raisin cookie. Next time I will add some cinnamon because the cookie itself is kind of blah.

This recipe is Da Bomb!  I made a few additions/substitutions.  I used 1 cup  of chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  I also used 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup of pecans.  I also added a teaspoon of rum flavoring!  I'm telling you!  This recipe will make you want to slap your Mama!!  LOL

Great!  I only bake 8-9 minutes, but I think I make them smaller as well.  I also used coconut milk and omitted the white sugar all together.  I think they would be deathly sweet with it in there!

Now, to be honest, I make awful cookies, no matter what recipe. These were wonderful, it is an easy recipe and we made two batches, one with peanut butter chips and chocolate chips and one with white chocolate chips and toffee chips. These were wonderful and we will use them again. Thanks for the great recipe

Cookies came out buttery and rich.  Made with bittersweet chocolate chips, we thought more of a dark chocolate taste was a good coupling.  Omitted nuts.  I think this recipe would be nice even with raisins as a more traditional oatmeal cookie, excellent for someone who likes an extra buttery bakery style cookie.

I did not care for this recipe. After tasting the first batch, I salvaged my ingredients by putting a cup of applesauce and 1/3 more sugar.  But we didn't like them.

My husband asked for a cookie with coconut, oatmeal and chocolate chips, and this is what I found.  They were very good!  I omitted the walnuts and added more chocolate chips.  They puffed up nicely and stayed nice and soft.  I will make these again!

Another exceptionally good cookie recipe!! If you like coconut and chocolate you will love these.  I too used more coconut and decreased the oven temp to 350.  They came out perfect.  Try these cookies--they're really amazing!!!

Awesome recipe! I would have used even more coconut, but I didn't want to open a new bag. I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used 350 F, for around 14 minutes (I went by the tops of the cookies). Thinking of adding craisins to the batter I didn't use yet. Very good.

These cookies are loaded with oatmeal, chocolate, nuts, and coconut, what's not to like? Baked mine at 350 for 11 minutes, they came out soft and chewy. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. There is only one problem with this recipe... I can't stop eating them! The only changes I made and would definitely recommend for other users is to decrease the oven temperature to 350 degrees and  add another 1/2 a cup of coconut.

These cookies were fantastic! I'm not a fan of coconut, and I loved them! Perfect texture, not too "crunchy" like some oatmeal cookies...Nice and chewy in the center...Kept for about a week...My boyfriend asked me to keep the recipe! Awesome awesome cookies :-) Thanks!

One of the easiest Recipes I've ever tried.  Everyone who has tried them has loved them.  Many people thought I bought them.  I adjusted the temperature down a bit and lessened the baking time and they are simply perfect!

These turned out great. A bit of trouble with the timing though. After 10 minutes, they seemed raw. After 14, still very doughy. I took them out at 16, though they were still very soft. As they cool, they harden up quite a bit, and 16 minutes was too long. 12 minutes was perfect for the next batch, but just know they‚Äôll come out of the oven still looking underdone.

After reading some people‚Äôs came out flat, I refrigerated the dough for an hour first and used parchment paper on the baking sheets. They still flattened some, but they weren‚Äôt too thin.

Definitely a family pleaser! Roughly ground honey roasted peanuts (using mortar and pestle) make a good substitute for walnuts about 2/3 cup is it great amount. I have also at times added either raisins or butterscotch chips and had success with both.

Good base recipe to customize on your own!  I browned the butter and let that cool before creaming it with the sugar.  I added 1 1/2cups of brown sugar and only 1/4 cup white sugar to make sure that they were chewy.  I added only chocolate chips and the oatmeal and they were delicious!

Well, given this recipe rates so high, I feel a bit of a traitor giving it 3 stars.  Didn't change anything, my cookies looked like the "glam" photo, and they were just ok.  I expected them to be amazing, ever eager and hopeful about all be-hearted recipes.  I agree with others that mentioned it's missing something.  You wouldn't think so with the star-studded list of ingredients it has, but , for me, it was a bit of a dud.

My new favorite cookie recipe!  It's good as written but the second time I made it, I subbed half the flour with wheat flour and added a little ground flaxseed.  I also used pecans in place of the walnuts... just my personal preference.  I baked at 350 for 11 minutes and they were delicious and chewy!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent cookie. Will definitely make again. Only changes I made was used 1/2 cup shortening plus 1/2 cup butter because I didn‚Äôt have enough butter; sifted flour, salt, soda; used 1/2 cup milk chocolate chunks and 1 1/2 cups semi sweet chips because that‚Äôs what I had on hand. Baked 15 minutes. Perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy on inside.

Came out flat but  I was hoping for that. Middle was chewy and outsides were slightly crisp. Will use this recipe all the time now! Note- first batch burned before 10minutes but after refrigerating batch no other batches burned and were prefect at 10minutes.

Great cookie. I used 1 c. chocolate and 1 c. butterscotch chips and added 1 c. craisins. Not a fan of walnuts so I used pecans. Baked a little longer so they were crispy/chewy cookies. This recipe is a definite keeper!

These are so amazing!  I cooked 350 for 12 min. But other than temp change I followed recipe exact.  My husband who doesn‚Äôt even like coconut loved these!  My son was disappointed when he saw me making these but loves them as well.  My new favorite!

I made two changes.  I substituted gluten free flour and coconut milk.  Baked for 16 minutes.  Wow, these are delicious. Makes about 6 dozen cookies. I am making for co-workers and clients at work, my hubby said, ‚Äòthey are going to love these. Nom. Nom.‚Äô

Followed the recipe almost exactly. Only difference is I used 1.5 cups mixed mini chocolate chips and heath bits, and a little bit of cocoa powder instead of the 2 cups of chocolate chips recommended. Only because that was all I had left in the pantry. 

These cookies were delicious and I'm sure to make them again with very few changes. However, next time I'll likely cut the recipe in half as I didn't notice ahead of time how much it would make.

This was very first time for me to made cookies. Taste is very good and little bit sweetness. This time I followed the ingredients to the exact. Next time I am gonna do a lil bit modify to decrease sugar and semi-sweet chocolate. Really good and easy recipe :))

Will make again :-)  Followed the recipe as is because I don't think it's fair to try a new recipe and then rate it with changes made.  That being said, I would only add 1/2 cup of coconut next time.  My oven is on the hot side so I baked at 350 for 9 minutes and they were perfect.

First of all, yum! I made according to the recipe but used a slightly smaller cookie scoop. They turned out great.  Interesting crispy, chewy, and still somehow fluffy texture - maybe due to the coconut addition? I made again and froze some dough balls for later use. Likely to become a family favorite.

I found these to be very flat and lacked flavor with slightly too dark of edges. Yes, I did use parchment paper as I always do.
After my first batch, I turned down the heat to 350 and added a little more flour, baking powder and chopped butterscotch chips. These came out PERFECT!! The butterscotch picked up the flavor and complimented the rest of the ingredients. Now I would give these 5 stars!

I will definitely make this again! This recipe was perfect. I made half the recipe but it was still a lot of cookie dough to freeze and save for later.  I did sift the dry ingredients and added a teaspoon of lemon juice like someone suggested. This is definitely a keeper. I kept it in the oven for 12 minutes and took it out to rest for about 10 minutes. These cookies are so chewy.

These are the most requested cookies from the guys in the conflict zones! They ship well, just wrap two cookies back to back in plastic wrap together wrap four packs of two cookies in foil and pack snug in a ziplock bag. The soldiers really enjoy these!

Too much chocolate, said no one ever!  Very quick and easy.  I thought that it would be too dry once I added the dry ingredients, but it was fine.  Didn't add coconut, it was still tasty.

Great mix of flavors. Don‚Äôt skip the nuts!  I forgot to add the nuts so my first two dozen were without. They‚Äôre great either way but I think the nuts made them better. Adds another great dimension to the cookie.  I made mine a little smaller since they went into Christmas cookie tins with 6 other kinds. Baked 9 mins and they were perfect. Thank you for this one!

Made these without nuts and with butterscotch and chocolate chips. They were perfect. Then froze half of the dough and just cooked from frozen and they were even better. I will make a batch to have ready around the holidays!

The five-star rating enticed me to make this recipe.  It was easy and I didn't mind or think the add-ins were too much.  I could see where the recipe could be changed up like many others did by using a mixture of different flours, etc.  I also halved the recipe and it still yielded a decent number of cookies.  The flavor profile was good.  I really think the directions should be modified to clearly state that you need to chill the dough for at least an hour before baking.   I would definitely use a smaller scoop as recommended  rather than a larger one.  Also, keep the cookies on the sheet to cool the recommended 1 minute, but promptly remove after that.  I rated a 3 only because I'm not sure I would try this recipe again, but if I did, I would definitely chill the dough to see if I get a better result in the appearance of the cookies.

I did add a tablespoon of lemon juice to it as suggested by another reader for chewiness.  I also only used 1/4 c white sugar and 1 c packed brown sugar, almost double the coconut (whatever I had),1 c semisweet chocolate chips, and baked at 375 for 12 min.  Love it!

These cookies are wonderful, I halved the original recipe just in case I didn't like it. Followed the recipe except for the substitution of pecans for the walnuts( didn't have walnuts). As for cook time, I changed it to 350 degrees for 12 minutes like what some reviewers have recommended, which I think is perfect because it is crisp outside but still soft inside. You won't regret making these cookies, a crowd pleaser!

Very delicious - esp straight from the oven :) Had to bake these for longer maybe due to my substitutions? I substituted whole wheat flour (1 1/3 cup) and cut the white sugar in half as suggested. Next time I think I'll add more walnuts and coconut as I didn't get that flavor (or sub coconut oil for some butter as has been suggested). Maybe less chocolate chips as well? Though my husband does not agree ;)

These were delicious! My Fianc√© also loved them.

I did make several changes:
-Cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup
-Used only 1 cup of chocolate chips
-Replaced some flour with whole wheat (3/4 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white flour)
-Used 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) + 1/2 cup melted coconut oil
-Used unsweetened almond milk since I didn't have regular milk
-I also threw in a few teaspoons of chia seeds. 

The coconut I had on hand was Trader Joe's unsweetened coconut chips, which I blended down to make smaller flakes. I did not add the optional salt. Also, I baked them for 10-11 minutes. Overall, I thought they were yummy and had a good consistency. Next time, I will cut the sugar even more since I thought they were plenty sweet, maybe only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar.

Cut the sugar, especially if you're using sweetened coconut or milk chocolate. Great go-to recipe otherwise.

Amazing cookies! Although made some changes since i try to make things a bit more healthy. Used coconut flour, almonds, only brown sugar (same amount displayed, just didnt add the remaining white sugar). Used baking powder instead. Added almond extract, cinammon, 1 low fat philadelphia cheese, and thats it..

Excellent recipe. I had to substitute vegan butter/almond milk/choc chips because I can't eat dairy. Subbed in pecans for walnuts, because that is what I had.

The cookies turned out great!

I made only one change (pecans instead of walnuts), and this is an almost perfect cookie. Might have been slightly dry, so next time I might add 1-2 T more of milk. I had all the perks - semisweet chocolate chips, nuts, and coconut. This could easily become my favorite cookie.

I really liked the coconut and the nuts.  I thought the cookie texture was too hard.  Not due to overcooking but maybe cut the oatmeal down a bit.  I would make these again.

I made this recipe for a large group of teens, and they were a huge hit!  I omitted the nuts but otherwise made the recipe as stated.  My daughter said that several commented that they normally do not like oatmeal cookies, but these were great.  They have requested that I make again for an upcoming event!  They are chewy and not too coconutty.  So if you really like coconut, you can probably substitute with coconut extract as others have suggested.

This was amazing! I had a couple minutes to make some cookies for friends and had no idea what I was getting into because I am Glutten free. It turned out great though! I couldn't find coconut so I only used chopped almonds and then I cooked for 12 min on 350 like someone in the reviews said... Amazing!!!

These cookies came out really good. Instead of the semi-sweet chips I used the dark chocolate coconut Toll-house DelightFulls and they taste  extra coconutty. The recipe made about 4 dozen cookies. I loved these

Used this mostly as a base recipe.  I didn't add nuts or chocolate chips.  I did add  two heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder.  I also only used about half of the white sugar, mostly coconut oil, almond milk instead of cow milk and used ground flax for  part of the flour.  I was trying to make something high fiber and somewhat healthy for the kids to have for breakfast-to-go.  I ate 2 and was full.  Yay!

Will not make again, cookies were not flavorful or moist, with only baking them for 11 minutes at 375.  The batter tasted good (I always taste test the cookie batter) however, the cookies came out with much less sweetness.

Amazing cookie! I tried my best to follow the exact recipe because I hate when people give ratings but make a lot of changes and substitutions. But, I only had 1/2 cup of brown sugar so I had to change the ratio of brown and white sugar. Regardless, it's an awesome cookie. Had to cook it a little longer - almost 20 minutes and the result was a cookie that was crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.

These were great!  A nice cookie to make when you are tired of regular chocolate chips, and will probably be fun to experiment with too.  For example, the coconut I used was sweetened (all I could find), so next time I will reduce or maybe even eliminate the white sugar.  And I might reduce the butter and replace with apple sauce instead.  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts because that was all I had and I think it worked well.

Def chewy, but mine did not spread much.  I did follow the OP's direction to chill the dough, perhaps it is not necessary for my oven.  Also, I made more than 24 cookies, and it was fine.  And decreasing the w. sugar to 1/4 c and the brown sugar to 1 c was fine with the sweetened coconut flakes.  I would make this again.

Yummy. My changes...no coconut (maybe next time), substituted applesauce for half the butter. Baked at 375* for 13 min. on an insulated baking sheet.  Came out slightly browned all over with a cake-y texture. A little sweeter than I like but still good. Next time will use less of the sugars. May also add a little more (1/4 cup) flour. Some cinnamon would also be good. Someone mentioned a tsp of Lemon juice to add crispness. Might try that too :)

This is a wonderful basic recipe and Just loved this recipe . i did follow other reviewers suggestions and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough I also substituted the white flour with 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour , just to make them healthier. I had no walnuts so I added a cup of dried cranberries . They are delicious.

I followed Goddess Diane of the Kitchen and reduced the sugar to 1/4 c white sugar & 1 c brown sugar, I also used 1/2 c butter & 1/2 cup peanut butter, I kept the chocolate chips and coconut measures the same. Put the dough in the fridge for easier rolling or spooning into balls otherwise its very sticky to work with. There are too many chocolate chips near the end of the dough though.  Cooked them for 11 minutes. They are more like a hermit cookie or trail cookie, I don't find them that chewy but they are really good!

I used the specified ingredients and the cookies turned out pretty horrible in my eyes.

These are the best cookies I've ever baked. And I've baked a lot. Perfect combination of flavors and texture. I added some ground flax seed and called them healthy. :)

This recipe makes a very nice muddle of the road cookie... Our family likes them with a little of a kick, so for the second batch I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, and about 1/2 teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg.  As in the recipe, I cooked for 12 minutes to make a crispy slightly chewy cookie.  I always freeze these as soon a s they cool, and just pull out what we need....

I love sweets as long as they're not too sweet! I did alter the recipe a bit and made baking adjustments. I used 1 c flour and 3/4 c organic oat flour. I only used 1 loosely packed c brown sugar instead of 1&1/4. I used unsweetened coconut, and 1/2 c Carob with 1/2 c mini semisweet choco chips. That was plenty chips. Baking 1st batch I used a small rounded spoon and didn't flatten. It baked at 375 @ 12 min and stayed ball shaped. Turned out ok. 2nd batch I flattened it out and baked at 350 @ 13min. Now they look like cookies! Golden perfect outside, chewy and barely sweet inside. Pretty good.

outstanding recipe.  only changes I made were Splenda substitutions for sugars... and Hershey's no sugar chips. (oh and butter flavored Crisco... just a personal preference) Many diabetics in my family and they said this was the best cookie I've made yet.  Kudos!

I'm a nursing mom and can't have dairy or chocolate, so I subbed coconut oil for the butter and used carob chips instead of chocolate, and they're delicious!!!! They cooked quickly in our oven. Next time cook for 10-12 mins.

The whole family loved these cookies, although I did change up the recipe a bit...I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I added a few tsp of cocoa and I added 1/2 a small bag of butterscotch chips as well. I baked then for 15 min and they turned out quite Yummy :)

Awesome recipe.... The only thing was I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I did half chocolate chips/half peanut butter chips and they were sooo good!  Used about half the coconut.

These are the best cookies by far! I made a few changes to the recipe by using pecans instead of walnuts (not really a fan of walnuts). I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of coconut flavor. Also, I used wheat flour instead. These are awesome!

Excellent recipe! I only had a stick of butter, and LOVE to bake with coconut oil, so I used a half cup of each. Happy to see the suggestion for using 1 tsp. lemon juice to keep the cookies soft - that def helped. Instead of including nuts, I used 1.5 cups of coconut but only had flakes, so I zapped them in the mini processor for a min. Also only had mini choc chips on hand which were good, but perhaps made the cookies more consistently chocolatey instead of just dots of chocolate. Next time I make these I might try without any chocolate at all and just let the oats and coconut shine.

These cookies are awesome and are a family favorite.  Recently, I discovered my son has a casein and soy allergy, but I was able to successfully adapt the recipe.  I used allergen-free chocolate chips.  Also, I substituted equal parts of ghee (a clarified and casein-free butter) and Earth Balance soy-free spread for the butter.

My family loves these!  I do substitute pecans for the walnuts, and use a variety of chocolate chips (white, mint, semi-sweet) depending on our mood that day.  Otherwise this is perfect just the way it is.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as close as I could- I did not add the nuts and instead of chocolate chips I added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips (i did not have any choc chips). SO YUMMY. Just the right balance of sweet and texture. Will be making again!

These cookies are sooo good. Once I started eating them I couldn't stop. I use almond milk instead of regular milk and I omitted the chocolate chips because I like to taste the walnuts and coconut without the chocolate tast getting in the way. I also used one stick of salted butter and one stick of unsalted and I added only 1/4 salt. Thanks for sharing this recipe. This is now my favorite recipe for making oatmeal cookies. Absolutely delicious

Fantastic with original recipe. The only thing I did do different  is to let the dough sit for an hour  so the oatmeal could plump up  as I use old fashioned oats. (No minute or quick). If it is to warm out store dough in fridge so cookie doesn't become flat while baking.

I love this recipe. Just whipped up a batch tonight. I like more coconut than this recipe calls for so I measured out half the dry ingredients as coconut and half oatmeal. Then doubled the coconut when I discovered that the consistency was still runny. I got 33 large size mounds from it.

Amazing with a couple changes, whole wheat flour, 1 cup of brown sugar & 1/4 cup of white sugar, 3 sticks of cooled browned butter with 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, and 1/2 a cup of cherry flavored cranberries soaked in rum for an hour, then add the leftover rum to one tablespoon of milk before adding the milk.

I made this without the coconut or nuts and it's the best chocolate chip cookie ever!  My daughter said it was the best cookie in the world.  I used an ice cream type scooper and it makes a lot of cookies.

I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts the first timeI made these.  I gave some fresh out of the oven to my neighbours and they declared them "the best cookies ever".  This time I am substituting dried cherries for the nuts.

These cookies turned out perfect.  I didn't use any nuts, and put in a cup of cinnamon chips for the chocolate chips.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Great recipe!  They were done in 10 minutes.

Recipe was easy to follow and results were great! Since another reviewer had problems with sticking, I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets and let them cool about 5 minutes before removing to wire rack - no sticking problems! I also substituted butterscotch chips for chocolate and no nuts (family preference). My family loved them and they disappeared fast! Will definitely make again!

Yummy.  Really enjoyed this cookie.  I made only one substitution and used pecans instead of walnuts because I like pecans much better.  I only got about 3 dozen out of the batch - probably because I made the cookies too big but that's all good.  This is definitely a keeper and I will probably make some modifications like other here - a little less sugar, toffee, etc, just to mix it up.

Very good.  I wish there was another element.  Maybe orange peel?  12 min is perfect for med scoop and softer insides.

I love love love these.  I've made them several times.  Most recently used dark chocolate chips (what I had on hand) and its better than semi-sweet, since the cookie itself is very sweet and I can only find sweetened coconut flakes.  my new "Go-to" cookie.

These cookies are delicious! BUT after following directions to a T they stuck to the pan and crumbled apart in gooey pieces when I removed them with a spatula. Anyone have any experiences like this that may know where I went  wrong? ...I put the rest of the batter in a Pyrex baking dish cause I was tired of cleaning the pans after every attempt. They're becoming bars. ;). Thanks for the delicious recipe.

These turned out great! I heavily modified it through to try to make it healthier. only used 1/4 c butter with 1/2 c applesauce, left out the 1/2 c white sugar, didn't use the salt, walnuts or chocolate chips. I also used ~2 tablespoons of unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk and only used 1 cup of flour. oven at 350

My partner and I LOVED these cookies. I took the advice of others and lowered the baking temp to 350. I also skimped a bit on the sugar. I added extra coconut because I like coconut. I replaced some of the regular flour with almond flour, because I had some on hand and thought it would be nice (it was). Skipped the nuts because I was out. Added a bit of cinnamon as someone had suggested. I will certainly make these again.

These are everything I love in a cookie.  Crunchy outside, chewy inside.  Lots of flavor with the coconut and chocolate and nice texture with the oatmeal.  I made exactly as the recipe called for except I used LOL Margarine sticks as I prefer that over butter for baking.

My oven is small so i had to make two batches. First batch at 190 degrees came out a bit burnt and hard, 2nd batch at 175 degrees was perfect.
The taste of the cookies is awesome though!!

Great recipe! These were very yummy and a great mix between chewy and crispy. I only tweaked this slightly by lowering the temp to 350 degrees and omitting the nuts (I substituted 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of coconut to make up the difference). I'll definitely be making these again!

THESE WERE AMAZING! When I told my boyfriend I was going to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, at first he was disappointed. He thinks I never make just plain ol' chocolate chip cookies, I always have to throw oats or peanut butter or something in there. Hey, I like to live on the edge! ;) He changed his mind when he got a taste! He loved them! Anyways, I halved the recipe since I was just making it for us two and I used a normal cookie scoop and it ended up making about a cookie sheet and a half worth when I spaced them an inch or so apart. THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE: No coconut, no walnuts. I also had read that they were too sweet, so I nixed the white sugar and added just a little bit more brown sugar. AMAZING COOKIES, SOFT, GREAT TEXTURE, TRY THEM!

I made these tonight...GREAT taste, but I didnt use any coconut, but instead used M&M mini's, some nuts and some choc chips to make them more like a monster cookie.  I found out too, the 10 minutes were the right time, sit out on the baking pan for 1 min then to a cooling rack worked the best while using a dark, nonstick pan.  Great tasting cookie!!!

We love these in our house and they are so easy to make! Several people have told me they don't like coconut or nuts but like these cookies. I use a pre-heated baking stone and only cook them for 8 minutes.

Awesome! Made some substitutions: 1/2 c apple sauce instead of another 1/2 c (stick) of butter, chia seed "eggs", 1/4 c chocolate powder and 1/2 c oat bran in place of some of the flour. Definitely did the 1hr refrigerator pre-bake!

I substituted  1/2 cup applesauce  and 1/4 cup fat free greek yogurt for butter,used only 1/2 cup of brown turbinado sugar and 1+ tsp of  liquid stevia instead of sugars, and whole grain white flour instead of flour to make this more suitable for diabetic diet.

I halved this recipe because it was only for 2 people. It was delicious! Definitely the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever tried. I used unsweetened plain almond milk in place of cow's milk, cut down on the walnuts just a little, and used sweetened coconut. I also baked the first batch as instructed and compared them to the second batch at the suggested 350 for 11 minutes. Both were edible and chewy,  but I found the batch baked at 375 for 10 minutes came off the pan easier.

I added a little less oatmeal and a little more coconut, just personal preference, and I made a batch with chocolate chips and a batch without.  While they were tasty both ways, I liked them best without (could really taste the brown sugar and oats, YUM!)  Great recipe!  Really loved the coconut concept!

Perfect.  Exactly as written, soft and chewy on the inside and crispy edges.  The only additional step I made was to refrigerate the dough about 30minutes and keep in the fridge between batches.  I baked my first batch as soon as I was done mixing the dough and the texture wasn't quite what I wanted, stayed more in a drop cookie shape and didn't get crispy edges.  These were plenty Sweet and I would also enjoy them with reduced sugar but I  like to judge recipes as written.  I will make these again either way. Thanks for great recipe.

If you're looking for the perfect oatmeal choco chip cookie, look no further!!  I have tried many recipes and finally found THE ONE!  The only change I made was to use half quick oats, half large flake oats.  I also ended up baking them for only 9 mins, because my oven is very hot.  Thank you, Woody

I was looking for a chewy oatmeal rasin cookie recipe but with an average of 5 stars I thought I'd give this recipe a try. 
The first thing I did was half the recipe.

First substitution I made was 1 Tbsp. of butter pecan ice cream instead of the milk, because there was none in the house.
Second substitution I made was a cup and a half of a mix of dried cranberries, rasins, and prunes, which I had soaked overnight in some spare pineapple juice I had from a container of fresh pineapple. 
I did add the alloted amount of nuts but used pecans instead of walnuts.
I also used the salt and left out the coconut because I'm allergic to coconut. 
Also, since halved the recipe and the cookies don't spread much, I made flat discs, 2 dozen to a 9X11 pan and cooked them for 7-9 minutes keeping an eye on them past the 7 minute mark. 

They came out small delicious and chewy. I'm the type of person who likes to "play" with recipes, and I'm sure the original version is perfectly good but I wanted to keep a reminder to myself or others what I did while it was still fresh in my mind. 

Thank you Woody Broadhurst for sharing this lovely recipe :-)

This is a great recipe! I, too, made some slight alterations. I'm not a fan of coconut or walnuts, so I cut those out. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. These also make great bars. I bake them for my husband and his co-workers and always get a great review!

Delicious! I am eating dairy-free while I breastfeed, so I subbed "lighter bake" by Sunsweet for the butter and these turned out amazing...especially frozen! cooked for only 10 minutes on a silicone mat lined cookie sheet.

This recipe is good, my husband loved them (of course he loves any cookie, but this one he really raved about!).  The 375 deg. temp did seem a little high, so I turned them down to 350, still browned too fast so I went to 325 deg. with about 9-10 in and at least 2 on the cookie sheet.  They also seemed a little runny, but I used old fashioned oats, maybe that makes a difference, I don't know, so I ended up adding some more flour to the recipe, maybe 1/4 cup or more and they came out perfect and the taste was awesome.  Definately a keeper!

These cookies are so good, slightly crispy on the outside and soft inside‚Ä¶ YUMMM! I did make some changes, but I don‚Äôt think it really affected the taste or texture of the original recipe much. In reading others reviews, that the cookies were too sweet, I used unsweetened coconut; which I measured and then put into my food processor to make finer. I cut the brown sugar to 1 cup, next time I will use the full amount (1 ¬º cups), they could have been a bit sweeter. Don‚Äôt use much refined sugar, so I used ¬Ω cup coconut/palm sugar in place of the white sugar. I used 1 ¬º cups AP flour and ¬Ω cup WHITE whole wheat flour; used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips (next time I‚Äôll use 1 ¬Ω cups) and then refrigerated the dough about 30 minutes. I used a 1 ¬Ω inch cookie scoop and placed the rounded mounds of dough, flat side down, on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet (you can reuse the same piece of parchment paper for each pan of cookies). I didn‚Äôt flatten them, just left them in the rounded shape of the scoop. They spread, but not a whole lot, placing them about 1 ¬Ω inches apart was perfect. I baked them in a non-convection oven at 350 degrees for 11 minutes turning the pan, front to back, halfway through. All ovens are different, so be sure to do a couple of test cookies, to see what temperature and time is best for your oven. Grandkids don‚Äôt care for nuts so I didn‚Äôt use any. The recipe, as I made it, yielded 96 (2 inch) very YUMMY cookies. Thanks,  Woody, for a great recipe.

These are one of the best cookies I have ever tasted or made. The only thing I changed was I left out about 1/4 cup of the oats, chips, coconut and walnuts to make sure the cookies didn't get too dry. I think they would still be a five star fixed exactly by recipe! They will hold up great to give as gifts!

Found some candy coated chocolate chips and some dessicated coconut in the back of the cupboard and it was a case of use them or throw them.  I chose to use them.  These cookies are very yummy and very moreish! I didn't have any walnuts so I subbed 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and added a tbsp of ground flax to try and get that "nutty" flavour.  I used half semi sweet chips and half candy coated chips. The candy coated chips gave it a bit of crunch.  I halved the recipe and using a tablespoon managed 27 cookies.

This recipe was awesome!  It does set very hard due to the oatmeal - so I undercooked mine.  I took them out the oven at about 8 minutes, just when the top of the cookie had slightly set.

Great cookies, wonderful mix of flavors, although not the prettiest cookie in the world.   BTW, I used one ounce of dough per cookie and got 60 from this recipe.

I normally do not bake but I decided to make these for Thanksgiving!
They were a hit. Everyone loved them and keeps asking me to make more. These are my new holiday cookies!

was very, very good.  used milk choc. chips.  I was out of eggs so I added a tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp additional milk.  turned out perfect.  next time i think i will run the coconut through the food processor since i didnt like the stringiness of the coconut, personal preference.  might try adding tosted almond slivers next time as well.  keeper

Even more delicious than I imagined they'd be! Using other reviewers' suggestions, I subbed in some whole wheat flour (about 1/4) and threw in some flax seed for fiber. I refrigerated the dough before scooping onto the cookie pans-- for perfectly thick, chewy cookies instead of the usual flattened crispies. Dropped temp to 350 and got golden chewy cookies after 10-12 min. Also, halved recipe and still got two pans full (about 24 cookies). This is the best cookie recipe I've used-- can't wait to try with raisins in place of chocolate chips! Would also be great as a bar.

These were pretty good, but they almost had too much "stuff".  I think it would have been better with half of the chocolate chips.  I used milk chocolate, because I don't really like semi-sweet.  This made a very thick dough, but my Kitchenaid was able to handle it.  4 stars because they were very tasty and easy to make; I just think all of the chips, coconut, etc. is a little too much.

These are very good and remind me of the "Magic Bars" you make with sweetened, condensed milk.  I, too, baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  As is usually the case with cookie dough containing butter, they tend to spread less while baking if you refrigerate the dough for an hour or so before baking.  Thanks Woody!!
