This was a very good recipe....but to make it into the mochi I remebered as a child in a Hawaii, I had to tweak it just a tiny bit. Instead of using milk, I had to substitute it with evaporated milk and I also omitted the coconut extract...WARNING! Baking it for 1 hour is too long and turns into a cake consistency, 50 minutes is perfect.

This is directed at Jaz's review. Butter mochi is not the traditional Japanese mochi that you see in "puck" form, nor is it like Chichi Dango manju.

Butter mochi is of Hawaiian derivation and shouldn't be viewed as the same type of "mochi" that you may have had with your Japanese friends. It is in its nature to be more "cake"ish and is meant to be eaten in squares like brownies or lemon squares.

So, while you are correct that this is not "mochi", it IS Butter Mochi.

First experience with mochi. What a treat. Everyone I offered it to loved it. My husband doesn't like coconut, but he couldn't get enough!

Very delicious!  This was the first time I made mochi and it turned out well, though there was some buttery spots on the top when it was done (not sure why the butter seperated out).

My friend and I made this recipe....and this is not Mochi, it came out like a cake. It was a cake with Mochi flavor. I am really familiar with Japanese foods...and this definitely was not mochi.

I have been experimenting with Butter Mochi recipes and this is by far, the Best.  My co-workers (my willing ginnypigs) voted hands down on this recipe.  Very light due to 2 Tblsp. Baking powder.  As I am in Hawaii, there are so many recipes but this one came on top.  Highly Recommended by me.  and my name is Mochi.

This was really good.  I didn't have coconut extract, so I used extra vanilla.  Other than that and halfing it, I made it as written.  Mochi has a unique texture, which I really like.  Thank you for posting this!

This treat reminds me of Swedish Rice. The second time I made it, I thought this is a pudding, a hearty pudding, so I put it in a hot water bath to bake it. I also added a cup of sweetened, shredded cocoanut. Last, I halved the recipe (3 eggs) and cooked it in an 8x9 pan. It was yummy!!!

This is the best butter mochi recipe I have ever made!  It's chewy and not too dense and addictively delicious!  I baked it for shorter than an hour in my convection oven because it was getting very brown, but it was done.

Sooo good! The crispy parts on the top are my fave.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  I really like this because it's not too sweet.  The flavor of coconut and butter are amazing

I had to make some modifications because I simply didn't have all the ingredients. However,  I'm so happy with it. I substituted almond milk for the milk and coconut milk, didn't add coconut extract because I didn't have any. I did add a dash of ground cardamom and I dropped teaspoons of Anko  (red bean paste), then baked it for 60 minutes.  I'm so excited that this came out so well, I usually do things by the book and never waver, but you should try this twist on it!

Not the typical mochi, but delicious none the less. This was very easy to make and the outcome was amazing. I ended up adding a drop of almond extract for aromatic purposes.

This is a very dense dessert - it reminded me of a dense coconut pie. If you like coconut, then you will probably like it but it is different than anything that I've had before.

Didn't have any coconut extract so not as flavorful. Really easy and delicious. More mochi cake than mochi.

Pulled it out at 56 minutes, put foil on top and cut it about 7 hours later (baked late and went to bed). I was worried it would be a bit under cooked in the middle but hoped it would set while cooling and it did. It was perfect. tasted just like home.

Yes people, this is not the normal Japanese mochi, it's butter mochi and I love it! This is a great recipe. I left out the coconut milk cause I didn't have any and used 3 cups whole milk instead and it came out really good and chewy. mmmmmmm
