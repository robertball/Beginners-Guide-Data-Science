Never thought I'd like anything to do with Lamb but this was great!  Tasty and easy to do. Served it to guests as part of an East Indian feast and everyone loved it !

Excellent sauce...added more cream and milk because it was pasty. Cooked chicken pieces in coconut oil and added them to the sauce. Served over rice with chapati bread. Delicious!
