I really liked this! To keep the bottom of the crust from getting soggy brush egg whites on it and bake it alone first.

My family loved this one.  I sliced my tomatoes and put them on a cooling rack over a sheet pan, salted them and let them sit for an hour to drain.  Then I patted them down with dry paper towels.  I served this at room temperature and everyone commented on how good this was.  I had not one piece leftover.

Very good.  I would recomend pre-baking the pie crust 10 minutes or so...helps if the tomatoes are a little to watery (I even salted and drained them).  The flavor was good, my husband thought it needed more heat.  While I was prepping it, I was thinking some canned green chili peppers would probably be a good addition (will add next time).  As for peeling the tomato's, I have put them in a hot water bath in the past.  Did some research, and found that turning them over an open flame (gas oven) for about 20 seconds total (don't "cook" the skin) was awesome.  Very easy to peel.

I have made this twice in the past week.  I sliced my tomatoes first and let them "drain" on towel-covered cookie sheet so juice didn't make my pie crust soggy.  Also, baked pie crust for about 10 min. before layering ingredients and misted w/olive oil.  Used fresh Thyme from herb garden.  Delish!!!

SO good! It's even better when the fresh tomatoes are in season. Make sure your tomatoes are seeded and drained really well or the crust gets gooey. We've made this for several years and just love it!!!!

I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise and pepperoni for the bacon.  I also used shredded cheddar-jack cheese.  Delicious--tasted like a thick, rich pizza.  My husband ate half of this pie by himself!  I did notice that it was a bit watery right out of the oven.  I used a baster to siphon off the excess liquid after baking and had no trouble with sogginess after doing this.

We love tomato pie!  I find that baking the pie crust by the directions, removing from oven and immediately sprinkling 1/2 cup mozzerella cheese over bottom and allowing it to cool for an hour, seals the bottom of the pie and it will not get soggy.  Hope this helps.

A winner!   You might try using Roma tomatoes to cut down on the wateriness because they don't usually have as much as regular round tomatoes. Of course because they're not as big, you would need more, between 6 and 8 depending on size. Loved it cold the next day too!

I had a hard time rating this recipe because it wasn't at all what I was expecting but it's all about taste and it gets five stars for that.  Reading the other reviews I was under the impression this was going to taste like a deep dish pizza so I served as a main course.  It was more like a good pile of tomatoes with cheese on top.  I peeled, removed seeds and sliced.  I let these drain for hours and even went through a half roll of paper towel blotting these every so often determined not to have watery pies.  Water wasn't a problem but the bottom crust got so soggy that it didn't exist.  I made one with bacon and one with pepperoni.  Out of six people everyone preferred the pepperoni.  everyone loved this but the only complaint was that it was not "filling" enough.  I will make this again but use as a side or with garlic bread.  Good way to use up tomatoes if you grow them in the summer.

I discovered this recipe about four years ago when I started getting bumper crops of tomatoes and this is definitely one of my "go to" recipes to use them!  Two things I recommend doing are briefly draining the tomato slices on paper towels to drain excess juice prior to putting them in the shell.  *Also, prebaking the shell for 10 minutes helps prevent a soggy bottom due to the tomato juice that cooks out.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

We LOVED this recipe! I used mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil from my garden. I also used half of a jar of REAL BACON PIECES, since I did not have bacon to cook. I have emailed this to all my friends, and placed this recipe in my permanent file!  THANKS!!

I've made this for years.  It's one of my favorite all-time recipes.  The slight differences I make are:  use prosciutto or diced ham instead of bacon, omit red pepper, use mozzarella cheese or italian blend cheeses, and the most important...add about 1/8-1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mayonnaise.  The nutmeg totally makes the meal!!!

This is a great recipe with a few changes. Coat the crust with beaten egg white. Always pre bake the crust, 10-12 minutes. I remove the seeds from the tomatoes to decrease the liquid. So wonderful with fresh from the garden tomatoes.

Been making this for years---but--- by all means bake the crust first.  I spread the crust on a pizza pan-bake for about 10 minutes or so and then layer with fresh baby spinach, purple onions, bacon crumbles, and lots of tomatoes. do this for 2 layers then top with the cheese and mayo.  cook till cheese and mayo have browned some.  It is devine---------------

I loved this pie and all the people I shared it with asked for the recipe.  I did read the other reviews and I baked the crust for 10 minutes and cut the tomatoes and let them drain for a bit.  I will definately make it again.

I submitted this recipe and would like to point out that measurement  were posted wrong and lemon juice omitted. I use 1/2 to 3/4 cup of mayo or miracale whip with a squirt of lemon or lime juice. Also used fresh and dry basil. Could also use  fresh garlic. This basic recipe is easy to change up with other veggies and herbs and chesses. Thank You

This was really delicious. I also pre-baked the crust & salted the tomatoes to drain before adding. To save a few calories, I think next time I'll leave off the bacon & the mayo & add mushrooms. Great recipe, thanks!

A little trick I learned from my favorite cafe...pre-bake the crust and add a thin layer of your preferred cheese to the bottom. I'd definitely still salt and drain the tomatoes, but thought I'd share her tip!

My family *loved* this recipe so much they fought over who got the seconds... looks like I'll be making 2 next time!  I followed the feedback of many of the reviews and 1) prebaked the crust and 2) used tomatoes similar to Romas (but bigger and a little less juicy) and then salted/drained them for about 20 min, patting them dry.  I could have drained them a little longer but the bottom crust was in pretty good shape.  I also used mozzarella (string cheese in a food processor) since I thought it would go better with the Italian herbs.  I served it with grilled Italian herb chicken - a great meal!  Will absolutely be making this again!

Very yummy! Drained tomatoes on paper towels for a couple of hours -- also prebaked crust about 10 min, and shortened baking time by about 10 minutes b/c edges were getting too brown.

If I could make a suggestion, try slicing the tomatoes and drying them out a little in the oven before making the pie.

I loved this recipe!  A couple of friends came for dinner and they were vegetarians so, of course I had to make a few alterations.  No problem!  I just didn't add the bacon.  My husband asked me to add the bacon next time although, he said he it was just fine with out.  I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from this site which always turns out great.  I added sliced zucchini, bell pepper, spinach, a large spanish onion, & the tomatos (peeled and seedless).  I used different cheeses: fresh mozzarella, fontina, provolone, parmesan, and asiago.  Also, I always try to use as many fresh and organic ingredients as I can so, I used fresh oregano chopped very fine instead of the dried.  Next time, for my husbands sake, I'll try the recipe exactly and follow it verbatim.   Oh, and as far as the soggy crust goes, I pre-baked my crust and brushed it with egg to create a seal.  It definitely helped.  I had no mushy crust; The crust was flaky and all of the veggies made this a really juicy pie.  Nothing will stop the juiciness of this pie and I like it that way!

I don't respond to these very frequently, but this dish was delicious! Using my garden fresh tomatoes and basil, it almost had a similar flavor to a fresh, yummy Margherita pizza. I used the accompanying pie crust and even using butter instead of shortening was the best pie crust. I made the crust extra thick for the kids (par-baked) and like others, drained the tomatoes in paper towels, used Mozzerella and skipped the meat entirely. This is a keeper!!

We enjoyed it -- I pre-baked the crust and squeezed diced fresh tomatos to get rid of extra liquid -- and happily ate the leftovers!

I made this almost exactly as instructed.  I used 5 good size ripe tomatoes, 1 tsp. cracked red pepper instead of 1/2 tsp., and 1/8 cup light sour cream  1/8 cup miracle whip, & 1 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  I made sure I salted and drained the tomatoes on paper towels according to others review.  The pie ended up being not runny at all and delicious!  A bit too spicy almost.  I would make this again when tomatoes are abundant!  I also baked the pie shelled coated with egg beaters for ten minutes to keep the crust crispier and it was.  Yum! A tomatoe lovers dream.

I wanted to love this recipe, I really did. I have so many garden tomatoes! I took the precautions to prevent a soggy crust, but there was such a puddle of juice on the bottom of the pan that I don't recall finding a crust. The flavor was good though, especially the fresh basil. I used part-skim mozzarella and turkey pepperoni--maybe saved a couple of calories! I will make this again with Roma tomatoes, and probably not add mayo to the cheese. I have family members who are creeped out by mayo. Thanks for a great recipe; hopefully next time I make it I will have better results with the tomatoes.

Yum! This was an excellent way to use tomatoes from our garden. I would agree with the people who said to drain the tomatoes before making this, as they do get the crust rather soggy if you don't. There's no reason to peel them, though, so I didn't.

Changed it up a bit by using Brie & Mozz, just what I had on hand and omitted mayo cause I was out.  "Sweated" tomato slices with kosher salt & put between several layers of paper towels for about 30 mins, also pre-baked (homemade) crust so with these modifications I did not end up with too much liquid in the finished product, although next time I will pre-bake crust 15 mins instead of 10.  I tried it hot & cold, prefered the cold.  Very good savory pie!

What a fabulous way to showcase summer’s bounty of ripe, delicious tomatoes!  Taking suggestions from other reviewers I sliced the tomatoes and then let them drain on a rack over paper towels for a bit and also brushed the crust with egg white and prebaked it for ten minutes before adding the tomatoes.  They were both excellent suggestions because I had no problems with a soggy crust.  I used fresh oregano instead of dried and along with the fresh basil it was perfect.  I can’t wait to make this again!

I made this pie for dinner last night and it was a huge hit!  The fresh basil in the recipe really did it for me!  I had made a tomato pie in the past but it had lots of eggs in it and was more "custardy".  This one was fresh and delicious and easy to make.

This was very good!  I did not allow the tomatoes to drain first, and will do so next time as it was a little soggy.  However, I didn't use a pie crust - I used a crescent roll dough, and it helped because the crust was thicker.  I believe the recipe for the dough was called "golden crescent rolls," and I got it on this website....after the dough rises the first time, simply roll it and use it as a pie crust in this recipe.  It's delicious!  I also did not use mayo because I don't like it.  Instead, I used light sour cream, and it worked well.

This was great!  I was looking for recipes with tomatoes since I have so many from my garden this season.  I didn't have a lot of the ingredients on hand but it still worked out great.  I sliced the tomatoes thin (about 1cm wide) using a serrated knife.  Sprinkled with salt and let them dry on a paper towel.  I used a sweet yellow onion instead of green onions and sliced 1/2 wide rings.  The bottom layer was onions.  Then tomatoes.  I sprinkled Trader Joe's Pasta Seasoning Blend (awesome seasoning with all the tomato stuff I have been making) over each layer of tomatoes.  Onion, tomatoes, pasta seasoning, onion, tomatoes, pasta seasoning.  Used TJ's 3 cheese blend mixed with the mayo.  I was busy preparing other stuff so I wasn't watching it carefully.  It probably could have been in the oven less than 60 minutes so I recommend watching it after 50 minutes to make sure the cheese top doesn't brown too much.  Finally, if you let it sit for 10 minutes, it won't be soggy when served.  Guests were suspicious when I said it was a tomato, onion, cheese pie but gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  This recipe is a keeper!

this was good, but not really what I expected.  I ended up chopping my tomatoes (do you know how difficult it is to slice a peeled tomato?) and I used half a sweet yellow onion sliced & sauteed in butter, instead of the green onions.  Fresh basil really makes this (don't try the dried stuff)!  Like another reviewer suggested, I like it with chopped peperronis, instead of crumbled bacon (but either is good, it's just that the pepperoni is less trouble).  The topping is the best part -- spread it on thick!  My main complaint is that the leftovers did not re-heat well -- tomatoes & basil became soggy!  (like "Fresh Tomato Pie" on this site by Britt Terry, much better!)

This was delicious!  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar because that's what I had.  Would definately make this again.  My husband suggested I dice instead of slice the tomatoes next time.

Way to much basil.Pre- bake your crust for at least 10 min. I don't really think
that the prep time is worth the end result, just Okay. Otherwise, Thank You for Sharing.

Love this recipe!  I have made this many times and even used stewed tomatoes in the winter time when fresh are not available. My favorite is made with Parmesan cheese ( The real Parmesano Romano) Expensive, but there is nothing else like it.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I so wanted this to be fabulous, but it was merely mediocre.  As other reviewers suggested, I salted my tomatoes to get rid of some of the moisture, but it still turned out pretty soupy.  Tasted better than it looked, but still not worth the fat and calories in my opinion.

We used garden fresh tomatoes but they were too juicy and sort of ruined the dish.  I don't know if sauteing them first to get the extra juice out would help?

this was really, really good!  I used heirloom tomatoes and salted them so they would give off some of their moisture prior to assembly of the pie.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I agree on five stars!  Tomato pie sounds boring but this dish is far from it.

THis came out beautifully !! I didnt have bacon so I used salami.It wound be better with bacon but still delish!MY tomatoes ,basil, and green onion, were fresh from my garden which gave it a huge kick. Also, I used -No Roll Pie Crest 1- found on this web site those two are perfect together.IMPORTANT TIP: Make sure you dried tomatoes on paper towel so the pie wont turn out watery!Thank you will make many more times!!!

I just finished making this pie.  It was dreadful.  I baked the pie crust as directed.  I dried the tomatoes on paper towels for 10 minutes after cutting.  I used half sour cream & half mayo. It still came out watery at the bottom.

This was a hit!  I followed recommendations for salting/draining tomatoes for one hour and patting dry, pre-baking the crust, and sprinkling cheese on the bottom right after you take it out (before any filling is added).  Mine was not watery, perfect moistness.. delish!

I am anxious to try this again, and may take more of a margherita/bruschetta approach with just tomatoes, basil, mozzarella (instead of cheddar) and garlic.. mouth is watering just thinking about it.

A great recipe for sure!

excellent with pretty much the same changes as previous posters: I drained the tomatoes first so not too soggy and pre baked the crust for 15 min first. The amount of tomatoes I had on hand was not quite enough so I stole the idea of a previous poster and tossed some corn in there too to fill the crust....came out great.

This turned out to be quite good.  After reading the reviews, I used Roma tomatoes so the crust would be less soggy, I brushed the partially baked crust with egg white also to prevent the crust from becoming soggy.  The crust was still a little soggy, even with all those prevention measures.  I did everything else as the recipe stated, and it turned out to be a good appetizer for our Super Bowl party.

Delicious!  Reminds me of Chicago deep dish a little.  Wish it was less watery, however.  I buttered and pre-baked the crust for 10 min and drained the tomatos to prevent sogginess but it did not seem to do much.  Husband went for seconds so I would still recommend this dish :-)

Love this recipe.  I bake the empty pie shell 10 minutes and squeeze the juice out of the tomato slices to keep the crust from getting soggy.  Use fresh basil if at all possible...it makes all the difference.

This is delicious! I used some tomatoes that we had left over from our Subway Party Platter and they worked much better than fresh cut up tomatoes, because they had drained more and kept the crust from getting soggy.

This was very good! I only used 3 tomatoes and should have used 4. Didn't have any green onions and it was still yummy. Also I forgot to cover it and it was still good at only 30 min in the oven, but probably will be better next time!

Ridiculously good!  Great way to use up our over-abundance of tomatoes!  Just wish I could have cut down on the fat content a bit :)

I did not like this recipe at all. The cheesy mayo topping was overpowering and unpleasant to the palate. It was so soggy including the bacon and there is nothing more disgusting than soggy bacon.

I can't imagine anything that would make this dish better than it is.  I followed the other reviewer's suggestions- used roma tomatoes, well drained and prebaked the crust. The flavor of the fresh basil and bacon are incredible.  This would make a grat brunch dish as it's similiar to a quiche.  If my crust was soggy, I certaily didn't notice because I was too busy enjoying the flavors!

Tomato pie is wonderful! I've been making it for many years. Lightly salting the sliced tomatoes and draining for aprox 20 min is essential to good texture. A 10 minute prebake on the crust is also important. I also don't use scallions, but shallots for the milder flavor.

We never had Tomatoe Pie before. After making it yesterday, we realize that we have been missing out. Will be making again.  I did use Roma's deseeded patted dry, salted and still had quite a bit of liquid. I did add a layer of fresh mushrooms, maybe that is where the liquid came from. Next time I will omit the mushroom.

I added 2 eggs and about 1/3 cup of milk to the mayo/cheese mixture.  It soaked all the way down to the onions and didn't just sit on top.

Unbelievably good! I had never heard of tomato pie until moving to the Lowcountry, but had some homegrown tomatoes and basil I needed to use. I cannot think of one single thing i would change about his recipe!

i really wanted this to be 5 stars, and it WAS very good, but it wasn't awesome. ya'll might laugh at this, but i was trying to recreate a dish from my college dorms, lol! they called it "tomato basil tart" and it was SOOO good!  so i omitted the bacon and used mozzarella cheese on this recipe, thinking it'd come out close to that dorm food.  it was very tasty, but not as good as my good old dorms though.  it did make a nice, light summer dinner served with garlic bread and some grilled zucchini though and i'll probably make it again.  thanks!

Winter tomatoes aren't as good as summer however this is a way to enjoy the wonderful flavor in a recipe that doesn't matter about the texture, the flavor is still there.  I can my tomatoes and I poured the juice off for breakfast and used the home canned, crushed tomatoe for this recipe.  WONDERFUL!!

Good idea -- basil, tomatoes, cheese, bacon, pie, oh yeah -- but big disappointment on the taste of the mayo in it. I might make again, minus the offender.

This was easy and delicious, and even my ultra-picky husband loved it.  He said it was even better the next day!  I will make again, but next time reduce the amount of cheese to 1 cup instead of 2.  I used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 cheddar, but next time will use all mozzarella (cheddar was too salty and hardened up after the pie cooled).  This is a winner!

I have made a recipe very similar to this for long time now. Learned it when I was living in Memphis, TN. The recipe I have calls for green tomatoes and no bacon. I recommend the green tomatoes, the tang they add to this recipe is great. I might try adding the bacon in mine, I mean everything's better with bacon right?

The idea of tomato pie turned me off initially.  I confess I had not heard of such a thing, but was I in for a treat!  I have eaten this recipe on many occasions and it just doesn't get old.  I think it is bursting with flavor and has a decent amount of kick with the red pepper flakes.  If you have a sensitive tongue, try cutting back or eliminating the pepper flakes altogether, but I think the combination of flavors is wonderful.  I've only used garden fresh tomatoes in the summer so I don't know if the grocery store tomatoes would give the same flavor or not.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I stay with the recipe instructions and love this!  I buy the refrigerated dough that comes two in a pack, and make two pies at once -- it is that good.  It sort of reminds me of a deep dish pizza.  You could throw in a couple extra veggies with it (or even some meat if you'd like) and it would be good too.  But I recommend trying it for the first time just as it is written.

Pretty good, but there was something in there that didn't agree with my tummy . . .maybe the mayo, actually.  I don't think it needs the mayo.  I didn't really layer everything over and over; I just did a layer of each thing, and I think I like it better that way.  I used a home made crust from here and used my quiche pan instead of a pie pan, and it worked well enough.  the only problem I ran into was my oven is acting up and it overbaked the pie a bit.  It's still tasty, though.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this to use up some tomatoes and fresh basil; now  I want to rush out and buy more!  Definitely need to make sure the bacon is crisp before layering in the pie.  This was good the night I baked it, but FAR better the next day for lunch.  Next time, I'll try baking it ahead of time to let the flavors "meld".

Instead of pie crust I "over" toasted panini buns, rubbed with raw garlic, layered tomatoes, onion fresh basil and salt and pepper and mozzarella cheese, covered with foil and heated in bbq.  The bread stayed crispy and it also soaked up any juices.  It was sooo good.

My husband said this is a cross between lasagne and a BLT. I'm not a fan of tomatoes and I even thought it was great. We did cut back on the spices and used the ones we had on hand (basil, marjarom and thyme). We also used shredded 4 cheese combo in place of the cheddar. I highly recommend this pie.

I did everything suggested - pre-baked the pie shell for 10 min. plus drained the tomatoes.  The bottom still was soggy.  Taste was good, but probably won't make again.....

I loved this! I also coated pie with egg whites and put it in the oven for 10 minutes first. And I made sure I seeded the tomatoes and set them on a paper towel. My husband loved it so much he asked me to make it again! Today I used sausage and bacon because I didn't have enough bacon-still delicious!

This was delicious!  Scored tomatoes and then boiled for 20 minutes in order to easily peel.  Have to roll out pie crust to fit in pie dishes. Left out the bacon and used 1 1/2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.  Used about 11 big basil leaves.

This is an Excellant recipe. I pre-baked crust for 10 minutes. Sliced about 8 roma tomatoes and let them sit in a colander for a couple hours, giving it a shake every now & then. Used half mozzarella and half Gouda for cheese. This pie baked up golden brown 
and not at all soggy. It was very good. This recipe is now one of my favorites. Thanks.

The taste was delicious but a word of warning... DON"T EAT FRESH FROM THE OVEN... allow to cool at least a little bit otherwise it is extremely juicey.... also allowing the tomatos to juice out might not be a bad idea.... also baking the crust first will stop to bottom crust fromagetting soggy.... the recipe tasted great though...
UPDATE UPDATE.... just ate the left overs cold from the refridgerator.... AMAZING

This is really a wonderful recipe -  the flavors are well-balanced and nicely spiced.  It would be a terrific dish to serve for brunch or lunch. BUT, it has a serious structural flaw - the pie is so juicy that it falls apart when cut.  This could be alleviated by using fleshier Roma tomatoes and deseeding them before cooking.

Really tasty.  I should have read the other reviews first and drained my tomatoes and/or prebaked my crust, maybe with an eggwash, or added a cheese layer on the bottom, because the crust did get quite soggy.  I have 2/3 of the pie left (only because it's just me), so I poured out as much liquid as I could, and I hope it firms up some as it cools.  Very yummy, though.

What a great pie! Something different that all my friends thought was great. Didn't change a thing. Took two pies to work and they vanished. Had to hand out the recipe. Oh, remember to seed the tomatoes. Adds to much liqiud.

This recipe was amazing! I added fresh chopped portabello mushrooms and used shredded Asiago cheese instead of cheddar. My husband asked for a second helping he liked it so much.

This is fabulous. I did use fresh oregano from my garden, added a little salt to the tomatoes, and left out the garlic powder. Minor and fairly insignificant changes! Definitely a keeper. Might try a low fat mayo and cheese next time to reduce calories, but meanwhile we are licking our plates!

I did everything other reviewers wrote to prevent a soggy bottom crust.  Hubby said the bottom crust came out too damp.  He gave it a 9 out of 10.

This was really really good.  I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out great!  Only a few changes... I didn't have fresh basil, so used dried basil.  And didn't have garlic powder, but I had Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic seasoning, so used some of that instead.  And we have a young daughter so I didn't add any red pepper, but we didn't even miss it.  And I only had regular onion.  Will definitely save and make this again!!

Absolutely delicious!  Blind-baked the crust for 10 minutes, added three jalapenos from the garden and some chopped garlic, used a great multi-cheddar mixture with a little sour cream in with the mayo...  It was our garden in a pie!  Used our red and yellow tomatoes, fresh basil and oregano.  Incredible flavors, texture and GREAT value. Did not add any salt, and am very glad - would've been too salty.

Watch out for the oregano here. I think it overpowers the fresh basil a bit. I might opt for no oregano next time and maybe just some fresh ground pepper.

Awesome! Made a few changes because of lack of ingrediants on hand, but still everyone loved it! Since pie shells come in packs of 2, I doubled the recipe on everything but the cheese (forgot to get extra), but it worked out great. Didn't have basil, but threw in some of my favorite seasonings (garlic powder, S & P, oregeno & Cavendars). Drained the tomatoes & baked the pie shell for about 10 mins prior to keep it from becoming too soggy. Meant to add the crushed Red Pepper, but forgot, no one noticed, but I will try next time. EVERYONE wanted seconds of this dish & the recipe. I've shared it many times already. I wonder if store bought or canned tomatos would work when fresh aren't available? May have to try to find out!

Lordy Mercy!!!  I've always, ALWAYS wanted to try a tomato pie but heard awful things about them being watery or tasting like mayonnaise.  This worked out PERFECTLY!  I did a couple of things differently, but this is one of those kinds of recipes that you can make little ingredient exchanges without compromising taste.  I pre-baked the pie shell (brushed with egg white) for 10 minutes, then added everything and baked.  I substituted Colby Jack cheese (because that's what I had on hand) and also used half and half sour cream/mayo.  I sliced the tomatoes thinly and laid the slices out on paper towels...dabbing off the moisture evey now and again.  We absolutely *LOVED* this.  After sitting 15 minutes, there was no sogginess whatsoever.  I will definitely make this again!!!  I also think it would be good with some feta.  Gotta try that!!!

Very tasty; I omitted the bacon and used 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 cheddar.  Also added a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic over the top just before baking.  A nice way to use up the tomatoes from the garden!

Thanks Donna!  I have made this twice in the last week! My son was home from university last week and LOVED this.  I sent him back to his apartment with what was left (one wee piece).  Made it again yesterday.  Ohhh...brunch today...yum!  I did drain the tomatoes on paper towels and the crust was great.

DELICIOUS.  Every time I've made this people have asked for the recipe.  I use half cheddar and half mozarella and substituted soy bacon; it gave terrific flavor.  And you can't even taste the mayo but it makes the cheese spread so easily.  It is so delicious.  Definitely pat dry the tomatoes on paper towels so it won't be so runny.  I will be making this recipe many many times - try it, you'll love it!!  thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a big tomato fan (neither are my kids) but my husband really liked this one! Very quick and easy.  I will drain the tomatoes on paper towels next time before adding to cut down on the wateryness of the finished product

Hm... I did not care for the taste of this pie. I think it had too much bacon or too much of something.  Maybe it would be better if I cut the amount of bacon in half.  I 'might' give it another try.

This Pie is really good and easy to prepare. I usually use more mayo and basil. Also for a different twist try canadian bacon or pepperoni.

I did make a couple of changes - confirmed some of them with other reviews...but OMG if this had 10 stars available my family would want me to rate it an 11!  
Changes: Pre baked the crust for 10 min after brushing with egg white / melted cheese on the bottom (used Gruyere) /  Started with layer of mixed Radish Greens & Fresh Basil - seasonings / then tomatoes, bacon, scallions...repeated /  sprinkled with minced garlic doubled the topping - used 1/2 greek yogurt 1/2 mayo  (to add protein).  Will be making again as long as our garden is producing tomatoes ( I used a combo of Beefsteak & San Marzano for this dish).

First let me say Donna, this pie was awesome!!!! It took much longer to prepare than I expect but defiantly worth the effort!!  I did pre-bake crust and salt and dry tomatoes. Since I used my heirloom Roma tomatoes perhaps I over estimated how many to use and ended up with enough for two pies. Silly me thought “well that is good, I will take one to my son and his wife”  Well... my husband and I do not eat large quantities at each meal but we KILLED 3/4 of a pie.  The remainder and the extra pie will never make it to my son’s house.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Pleasantly surprised because I've made tomato pies before and they were just not very tasty.  This is a great way to use up my end of summer tomatoes.  I did what a lot of reviewers did and laid the slices on paper towels and pressed lightly to remove excess water.  I also prebaked the pie shells for 10 minutes.  Really excellent flavor!  I made two and used only 1-1/2 cups of cheese each because I felt it was too much.

So good! Followed the recipe exactly until it came to the cheese.  I added Gouda and Swiss to it, and there wasn’t even a crumb leftover! Everyone loved it, especially since I was able to use fresh garden tomatoes from my mother-in-laws garden, yummy!

It was enough to make 2 pies!! I had to add more cheese mixture to top but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I did however spray the aluminum foil with cooking spray to prevent the cheese from sticking & I highly recommend that!  We loved it.

Mixed in an Italian cheese blend with the cheddar and small dollops of fresh pesto. Doubled the recipe to fill to pie shells and both came out great. Rich but tasty! Will make again as I am inundated with tomatoes.

I have made this many times. Sometime I substitute crumbled sausage for the bacon and sometime I use only tomatoes and spices. My favorite, easy and tasty recipe.

Very tasty but there is a serious flaw in the recipe. The bottom crust is soggy and partially cooked due to all the water content in the tomatoes.  The tomatoes need to be salted and drained before used. And perhaps pre bake the crust. I will try this next time.  If not for the crust issue I would give it 5 stars.

Delicious! The entire family raved about it, I've made it 2 times and loved it each time. I did skip the red pepper (gotta keep the kids happy), but all the other ingredients I kept the same, I did not skin my tomatoes (to lazy) and it was fine. I did pre bake my crust for 10 minutes first, the crust can get pretty soggy from the tomatoes, but honestly even with a soggy crust it was still a delicious dinner!

I drained the tomatoes as much as possible and placed crumbled Cheez-its in the bottom of the pie with a layer on top just under a layer of cheese. I also layered everything twice.

I made this without the green onions (because I didn't have any) and used a basic pie shell recipe I have that only takes five minutes to make. It was very delicious and was met with approval by all partakers of it! 
 
Pie Crust recipe used: 

1 c. + 2 T. flour
1/3 c. vegetable oil
1/2 tsp salt
2-3 T. cold water

Mix flour, oil and salt. Sprinkle in water, 1 T. at a time, and mix. (If pastry is dry, add 1-2 T. oil). Gather pastry into a ball. Roll between two sheets of parchment paper.

This recipe is awesome! After reading other reviews I also prebaked my frozen store-bought crust.  I used Roma tomatoes and sliced them, salted them and drained on paper towel.  I substituted Monterey Jack cheese instead Cheddar and also sprinkled a little grated Parmesan between the layers of tomatoes.  I covered the edges of the crust with foil and baked for 30 minutes.  I removed the foil and baked for 10 more minutes.  I served it with a Ceasar salad.  Absolutely delicious!

Fine-  need to try again.  I didn't use enough tomatoes.  Flavor seemed nice though.   Didn't like the bacon unless it was super crunchy.

Took the two suggestions to leave cut tomatoes to drain for a few minutes, and precook the crust for 10 min. then sprinkle in some mozzarella and let cool. I made 2 pies as we had a crowd and everyone loved them. Will definitely make again and enjoyed using up some garden fresh tomatoes this way.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding just a bit more mayo, as I felt that there wasn't enough to bind the cheese together.  It was DELICIOUS!!  OMG, YUM.  And I can totally see a bunch of modifications one could make to change up the flavor profile.  I'll be making this as long as I have tomatoes coming off the vines!!

It was rich, almost greasy.  Next time, I will skip the mayo as it just made the cheese crunchy and maybe use mozzarella instead of the cheddar it calls for.  It was different and family liked it...soooooo.....I will probably make it again!

I loved this recipe.  I did read a lot of the reviews beforehand, and spent a lot of time and paper towels drying the tomatoes.  I also pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before filling the crust.  I used pancetta pieces instead of bacon, and fried it a bit.  My bf critiques my creations, and tells me if a recipe is a "keeper."  He is generally a light eater, but he had 3 pieces!

I've made this a lot, and it's wonderful!  I did bake the pie crust for about 10 minutes so the bottom wouldn't be soggy.  That was a good tip, it worked.  I love to make this in the summer when we can get home grown tomatoes from a friends' garden, what a difference!  The flavors are wonderful together.  It's great warm, or even leftover.  We love this!

Made this a few times- each was excellent. Instead of bacon I substituted pepperoni and also swapped plain greek yogurt for the mayo. I've also added mozzarella cheese and it gave it a pizza flair. Yum!!! Tastes fantastic. Husband is picky eater and he devoured it each time I've made it. Learning to double  this recipe because it goes quickly.

A really fresh pizza in a pie shell. I used half bacon half chopped pepperoni. Great reheated leftover as well.

This is fabulous!!! As others I baked the shell {brushed w/an egg white 1st} for 10 min. Added a full lb. of bacon. I also added a small layer of Ricotta cheese on top of the last layer of tomatoes then topped with the cheddar/mayo mixture.  Everyone raves about this & wants the recipe!

I used cherry tomatoes all different colors (they came that way from Sam's) on top of the other ingredients (bacon, mayonnaise, green onions and cheese, etc) instead of putting on top of the sliced tomatoes ... the pie was always running and got soggy no matter what I did so it is a lot better this way ...love roasted tomatoes anyway. I also used a tart springform pan. The flavors are amazing especially the red pepper & fresh basil.

Made tonight and thought it was fabulous.  I had to make myself stop eating or would have eaten the whole thing.  I made the following changes.  I left the peeling on tomatoes and removed the pulp from each slice of tomato.  Let slices of tomato finish draining on a paper towel.  I pre-cooked the pie shell for about 15 minutes in 375 degree oven and before layering ingredients, I placed 3 slices of mozzarella cheese around the bottom of the pie shell.   I will definitely be making this again.

One of the best tomato pie recipes I've tried.  Loved the addition of the bacon.  I had to make more of the cheese mixture to be able to cover the entire top.  Perhaps I put it on a little thick... As others have said, it's important to brown the pie crust first and to salt the tomato slices and allow them to stand to drain the moisture out before layering in the pie crust.

This recipe was pretty good! I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. I also mixed some parmesan cheese into the mozzarella/mayo combo. I wish I would have pre-baked my crust as it did get a little soggy, but everyone loved it and my kids had seconds. I will definitely make this again!

Really liked this! I used fresh mozzarella, and omitted the meat (though I definitely want to try with bacon sometime!). A little watery (even with draining/seeding the tomatoes first), but not bad...it might just be inherent in this type of pie. I think using a baster to remove water throughout baking might work, or maybe pre baking the tomatoes just for a few minutes to get some water out. Very tasty, though!

Great recipe!  I added a little mozarella to the cheddar.  I havent tried with pepperoni and probably want. We love homemade pizza so we got that covered.  Draining tomatoes on a pappertowel is a must and if you have really fresh tomatoes you dont have to peel them.

I used filo dough instead of pie crust (because that's what I had) and it turned out really delicious!  I made it in a 9x13 pan and made about 1 and 1/2 the cheese mixture to cover everything.  Absolutely delicious!  (I am also a vegetarian, so I used fake bacon instead of real bacon)

This was GREAT! One pie fed 4 people, but they could have ate more and thought it was sooo good!! I doubled the receipe and made 2 pies, since it wasnt that much more work to make another pie, and plan on eating it tomorrow for lunch with a salad. yummy! This was a great way for me to use the abundance of basil from my garden!  I will definitely make this again!

Even after prebaking the pie crust with egg whites and thoroughly "draining" the tomatoes, the crust still got soggy - but very tasty.  The first time I made it I used maple bacon, but it was waaaay too salty for my liking.  This time I'm using reduced fat bacon and being sure to not add any additional salt.  Very good though!  My husband requests this weekly:)

This is the second time I made this. I took the recommendation of one of the rate and let my sliced tomato lay on paper towel to get rid of some of the juice I also peeled my tomatoes. The paper towel tip worked. I will be using in the future. These are always good and you can use any herb.

I would have just given this 4 stars because I was lazy and didn't peel the tomatoes, but I'm sure that if I didn't have to pull the stringy peels off the pie for almost every bite, it did deserve a 5!

YUM! GREAT suggestions (don't use deep dish, pre-bake crust, salt & pat dry, romas, etc). I also sub'd sour cream & splash of lemon juice in place of mayo and added fresh spinach...juicy, not runny!

Mine ended up being fairly watery from the tomatoes which resulted in the crust being mushy, but it was very tasty. I added about a 1/2 cup extra of cheese and reduced the crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon.

I made this for dinner and my husband and I loved it! I followed others advice and precooked the crust for 10 minutes and well as blotted the tomatoes so they weren't as watery. It was great as is, wouldn't change a thing!

This a good pie recipe.  I made my version of this with turkey bacon, mozzarella cheese and Italian seasoning mix.  I would definitely make this again.

This was SUCH a keeper! I was leery of making it - school night, busy, and there's all that shopping to do - but it was so definitely worth it. (And not so much work at all once I had the kids help with the chopping.) The flavors blend beautifully. Totally YUM.

I loved this! Left out a few things like the green onion (didn't have) and the red pepper. The fresh basil was a really nice touch. I salted and drained my tomato slices slightly; I don't think my pie was soggy at all. I may leave out the bacon, next time, as I'm not much of a meat girl in the first place. I could see this with other veggies added; I had some fresh mushrooms and am sad I neglected to put some in. Oh, and I used mozzarella cheese, and less than what was called for. Growing up in an Italian neighborhood, any dish with both tomatoes and basil just begs for some good mozzarella.

Wonderful my husband has told everyone about how good this is. I did cook the crust for 10 mintues before filling it. Used our homegrown tomatoes. Going to make it again tonight second time this week. Thanks for my newest fav recipe.

I just made this today for the first time.  It is excellent!  I didn't add as much cayenne as the recipe called for because I don't care for hot spices.  Other than that I left it the same and it is awesome!

Everybody loved this.  Not at all complicated.  I failed to peel and it still came out well.  I did put mayonnaise on the crust before building the pie and the crust was just fine.

This receipe was very disappointing. Very flavouful but it was very soggy due to the juice from the tomoatoes. I didn't read the reviews first, but I do agree that the tomatoes should be seeded and drained.  I'll try it again

The Tomato Pie I was delicious.  My husband and I loved it.  Will make again.  Like other reviews, I pre-baked the pie shell.  Was not soggy.

This was DELICIOUS! My family raved about it, will definitely be making this again. In reading the other reviews about baking the crust for about 10 minutes was a good idea, the crust was not real soggy because of this. Then when peeling the tomatoes, I put them in a pan of boiling water, only for a second and the skins came right off. I add more onions, basil and seasoning then it called for.

I made this last night for dinner...used a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and put it in an 8" cake pan, pinching the edges.   Used 3 large tomatoes, sliced Vidalia onion and Mexican shredded cheese mixed with shredded mozarella.  Baked as directed and let sit for 2-3 min. to set before cutting.  Although we had a smaller pie, it was filled to the top and delicious.  My husband ate most of it!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this with some leftover tomatoes and wasn't really sure how it would go over. My son loved it and my husband ate over 1/2 the pie.  I will make again for sure.  Changes:  Used salt & pepper and just a slight amount of cayenne, used mozzarella as topping, used vidalia onions.

Fantastic!  Especially now when home grown tomatoes are in season.  I did prebake the crust and the bottom was not as soggy as I expected after reading reviews.  I used fresh mozzarella cheese, and it was fabulous.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  Will definintely make again.

pretty good - cooked crust for 10 minutes and mixed sour cream and mayo with cheese for topping.  Wasn't runny at all (I did smoosh the tomatoes in a collander with salt for 1/2 hour or so to drain).

I made this last night using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I sprinkled all the spices on top (forgot to put them in).  It was really good!  I'm hoping it's going to be as good or better for lunch today!

This was ok. For me the mayonnaise flavor was too strong.  The flavors didn't come together well.  I won't be making this again unless I have a bunch of garden tomatoes given to me.

We really liked this.  I did cut down on some of the fat by using turkey bacon, low fat mayonnaise and less chesse.  I think the key to the great taste was the fresh basil.  Great use for those home grown tomato's.

Very tasty! Apart from omitting the oregano, and using a little 5 Cheese Blend as well as extra-sharp Cheddar, I followed the recipe exactly. Even Husband, who isn't much of a quiche fan, thought it was pretty good. Thanks!

Prepared as directed, this recipe is really greasy and very rich, but flavorful.  If I made it again I would probably leave out a lot of the mayonnaise and some cheese.  Too rich for us to eat more than a small slice each.  Seemed a very southern dish to me.

What an easy and tasty recipe. It had wonderful flavor and was even better the next day. I highly recommend this. I drained the tomatoes and absorbed as much as I could with paper towels, so it wasn't mushy like some of the other reviewers mentioned. My husband even told his co-workers about it, and they want the recipe.

This is absolutely delicious!  It takes some preparation time, but it is definitely worth it! Kids like it, too!  My little sisters love this pie.

I don't know why it didn't occur to me that this is really a pizza!  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried - not the same results.  Also, there was a LOT of liquid  at the bottom of the pie  - from the tomatoes?    Even though I wasn't crazy about the pie my husband LOVED it.  He finished it for us!

This is a great recipe, it's so different from anything else in my recipe box. It's great when you want a change from the norm. I even took it to for lunch the next day, it's great cold or heated in the microwave. One warning though you have to like basil to enjoy this one.
