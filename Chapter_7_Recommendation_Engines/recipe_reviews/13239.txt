Very very good. As another reviewer suggested, these puff up so much I wish I would have rolled them thinner and cut them smaller! Also, make sure you have plenty of liquid to cook them in; I would say they more than double, and if they can't move freely while cooking there will be trouble (and don't ask how I know that! LOL!) I added a touch of my favorite dried herbs, and cooked in the crockpot on high for about double the stated time. Excellent. UPDATE: Made these again per the recipe (1/2 batch this time), again adding some herbs, just wanted to say they turned out great again!

I've changed it just a bit...  Since it calls for 1/3 cup of shortening, I used mostly shortening and then some butter to make the 1/3 cup total.  Use shortening for the tenderness and butter for the flavor.  I've used all shortening and all butter and this way is the best!

I think it needs to be said for those new to cooking folks, to handle the dumplings as little as possible after adding the milk.  That way they will still be tender and not tough and rubbery...

Mamaw, are you posting your good ol' southern recipes under an alias??? Simple, easy, fast, plus my 5-year old twins & 3 year old love to help me make these. I've made this recipe about 2 dozen times, often doubling the recipe as another reviewer wrote, & each time they come out GREAT! Cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter like you would biscuits, then roll out the dough on a floured surface and pat flour on top before cutting.  Use a pizza cutter for speed -- pretty, perfect dumplings ain't what it's about, ya'll! When dropping in the dumplings, stir gently when about half are added, then once when you add in the last, then cover & cook for the remaining time. I cook a couple chicken breasts in the broth, then shred them into pieces before adding the dumplings.  Very good with fresh asparagus & a side salad -- especially for a chilly winter night's dinner.

With my family of 6, I always have to double this recipe, which I have made numerous times, tonight included. But so very easy to do! I use butter flavored shortening and instead of the salt I use chicken seasoning. I also add a good sprinkling of course ground black pepper and about 2 tablespoons of dried parsely.... but remember this is when the recipe is DOUBLED. 

Instead of the chicken broth in a can, I fix it with a whole bird that has been slowly boiled, skinned deboned.Meal in itself. Just like the way my husband likes dumplings. I USED to be a drop dumpling Gal... but NOT NO MORE! Thank you very much Jessica! A well deserved 5+ star recipe.

Loved these. Very easy and comforting food that will be one of my regulars.  I did have some trouble getting the dough to stick together without overworking it, but I just wrapped the doughball in plastic wrap and let it "rest" in the fridge for about 15 minutes before trying to roll it out. This step helped a lot.

What a truly EXCELLENT recipe!  Simple, few ingredients and steps, and delectable!!  This is coming from someone who cannot stand dumplings--swore them off years ago having been forced one too many times to stomache my mother's "refridgerated buscuit" version of chicken and dumplings-- I wouldn't eat them muchless  make them.  To my dismay, it is a favorite comfort food of the man of my house.  When I found my icebox empty of almost everything barring 5 chicken thighs yesterday and a family of five ravenous people in the house, I decided to give this a shot.  What wonderful luck!  Not only were they easy to make, they tasted fabulous! It is now a family favorite.

The only thing I will do different next time is roll them out very thin.  They tend to puff up quite a bit when cooking. I think maybe a little less than 1/8 of an inch in thickness would be perfect.

Kuddos on this one!!

After kneading this a dough a bit by hand and dusting it well with extra flour, these dumplings rolled out perfectly!  Cooked to perfection in 10-20 minutes in the chicken broth at a medium boil and tasted like my Mamaw's.  Be sure to roll them out thin for good results, otherwise they could be too doughy.

Wow! I can't beleive how easy these were to make.  I had an extra rotisserie chicken on hand so I deboned it and made a basic stock.  I boiled the dumplings in the stock(about 4 cups) and added the shredded rotisserie chicken and some fresh parley at the end.  My husband said that it was the best chicken and dumplings he ever had! Thanks!

recipe tripled easily, made enough for three standard size(big) soup pots. Was wonderful and homey- just as other reviews praised!! Added poultry seasoning, garlic powder  and pepper to flour mixture before rolling dumplings out.  Had to leave house unexpectedly, so after mixed dough  formed into a ball and wrapped  it in saran wrap to keep in the fridge for a few hours. NO PROBLEM!Just rolled out 1/4 of the ball at a time and cooked them in batches of much more broth than original recipe called for. After I boiled each batch, i "fished" them out of the broth and kept them  aside until I had all cooked. After all were cooked, I divided the dumplings among three soup pots and then divided my chicken and soup ingredients among each pot (FINELY chopped carrots, celery, green pepper, onion and bigger hunks of light and dark meat cooked chicken) I thickened my soup with cold broth I saved earlier mixed with seasoned flour to pour into soup.  Last, but not least, go easy on the salt so if you need to still thicken it add in cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup.  My family loves this recipe!!! I usually (in the past) just made drop dumplings from Bisquick biscuit mix (because my previous efforts at rolled dumplings weren't worth all the effort). No more! These dumplings reminded me of my dear mama's from Macon, Georgia that I miss so greatly. Rest in peace, Mom! I miss you!

These are so easy to make and so much better than the drop type dumplings.  I wound up having to make 4 batches for my chicken and dumplings because my family kept eating them all.  I rolled them out pretty flat and used a pizza cutter to make small triangles then dropped them into the simmering liquid.  They plumped up but didn't get overly large.

Unbelievable...just like moms!

I tried this recipe about 2 weeks ago with some chicken broth that I had made from left-over roasted chicken.  My 76 year old mom came to dinner and raved about how the dumplings were better than her aunt's.

Last week I still had some of the chicken broth (with plenty of chicken in it) in the freezer and was hungry about 10 PM:)  I didn't have any shortening so I substituted with 1/4 cup of bacon fat (I always keep left-over bacon fat in a cup in the fridge after I cook it)...it turned out "OFF THE HOOK!".  The extra flavor from the bacon fat added another dimension!

I don't understand why people say that cooking can be so difficult.  My secret is to cook a big piece of meat on Sunday (Chicken, beef, pork shoulder, etc.), then I have plenty of left-overs the rest of the week to be creative and fast with meals for my husband (tacos, enchiladas, pot-pies, soups, etc.).  Get the major cooking out of the way with a big piece of meat on a not so busy day and the possibilities are endless!

This is exactly what I was looking for in a dumpling, almost, almost like Cracker Barrel.  The trick is rolling them out extremely thin so that when they puff up they are not just big dough blobs.  They were dense but still soft and gooey.  I loved them and will continue to use this recipe from now on.  Thank you so much for posting it!!!

I've made the dumplings from this website a least 100 times over the last few years. Okay, not really 100, but quite a few. They've turned out great EVERY single time!

I've only made a few changes. I double, or triple the recipe. I don't sprikle the dumplings lightly with flour, I coat liberally with flour which helps thicken the broth. I also usually add a whole chicken or a few chicken breasts. I use a few spoonfuls of Better than Boullion chicken flavoring to enhance the flavor too.

5 stars because the ingredients were perfect. However someone (probably my better half) put sugar in my salt bowl. (I use bowls trying to be like the cooks on TV(:). I put a tsp. of sugar instead of a tsp. of salt. I mentioned to my guests that I thought the dumplings needed a little more salt. I had to make more dumplings right away cause I had a lot of broth left over, or gravy. Anyway, I discovered the sugar in my salt bowl. By this time I had already added the sugar to the second batch. I just added a tsp. of salt to the mixture and continued on. These dumplings were outstanding. I mixed the dough in my food processor. I added the shortening to the dry ingredients and let the food processor do the cutting. Then I slowly added the milk until it formed a ball. Quick and easy. I thought this might make the dough tough but it didn't. I didn't even taste my tsp of sugar. Probably because of the salt, the second dumplings puffed up more than the first. They were tender and delicious.

These are the perfect dumplings!  If you roll them out as thin as the recipe says (1/8 of an inch), they're wonderfully soft and flexible and a tiny bit chewy, but in a good way.  I've tried many dumpling recipes over the years and this is by far the best.  I've made this recipe several times, it's definitely a keeper.  I think the difference is that this recipe has baking powder in it.  Chicken and dumplings (I use my own recipe for the stew part) made with this recipe is probably our favorite meal and it's always special.  One last thing, a little bit of poultry seasoning is a nice addition to the dumplings.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was so hard to roll them out. My dough was very hard and crumbly. While mixing it, I could barely get it to hold together. I added about 1 more tblsp of milk and still almost impossible to roll. I must have done something wrong, but not sure what. I rolled them as best I could, added them to boiling stock and they turned out kind of gummy. I made them based on all the excellent reviews, so I must have done something wrong.

Update: I've made these a few more times and found that they rose to the surface of the soup each time.  Im guessing it was my baking powder.  Still tasted great all the times I've made them!  

These were excellent tasting dumplings.  Especially the dough!  My kids loved that part. ;-)  I thought they tasted great after cooking as well, but mine didn't float after cooking them.  I thought they'd rise to the surface like most dumplings do, but these didn't... not sure why they didn't.  So that's why I gave it four stars instead of five.  I think if I cooked them longer they would have fallen apart.  But, this was delicious nonetheless and my pickiest eater loved it!!!

These were good but I wish I had added some herbs ... they were quite plain.  I will make them again adding some pepper, parsley, and using butter flavored shortening.

These rolled dumplings are beautiful & taste so so good.  They are soft, not slippery and noodle-like.  I made a basic chicken soup w/celery, carrots, potatoes & when tender I added the cooked chicken and then the dumplings.  I followed reviewers suggestions to use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  The dough came together easily and was soft but not sticky.  Floured the counter liberally, rolled to 1/8 in., sprinkled w/flour & cut w/a pizza cutter.  The flour on the dumplings thickened the soup beautifully.  Only wish I'd had peas to add & next time I'll add some fresh parsley, too.

I had no problems at all with this recipe.  Thanks for having a recipe for dumplings that doesn't need eggs!  I'm trying to stretch my budget and this was perfect.  Will make again and again!

I was raised on drop dumplings, but I really like to make these and freeze ahead. Just add them in when your'e in a rush. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy peasy recipe that was surprisingly quick from pantry to table!    One change we made:  Substituted 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (to 3/4 regular all-purpose).  The dumplings didn't suffer too much, but next time, I'll stick to the recipe.  Dumplings aren't supposed to be health food.   :)  Tip:  Very important to roll these THIN.  How we used the dumplings:  Boiled them in organic, store-bought chicken broth (two cartons), then added shredded chicken, left over from yesterday's crock pot cooking.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe.  This is a keeper.

SIMPLE RECIPE. 
I use butter flavored Crisco and added pepper. Next time I will roll much thinner. maybe an 1/8th inch. they were a little to thick for my taste, but MUCH better than drop or biscuit dumplings!!

Just what I was looking for! These lean more toward a "hard" than a "soft" dumpling, but were still nice and tender. A good middle ground, I suppose. I combined the dry ingredients in the food processer w/ the chopping blade, then pulsed in the shortening and, finally, the milk. Super easy. Dump it out and roll it, and you're good to go!

I thought this recipe was spot on. It doubled easily too. I boiled three chicken breasts, with onions, peas and carrots in 2 quarts of chicken stock before adding the dumplings. Mmm!

Recipe turned out good with some minor adjustments. Mixed all ingredients together in mixer. Dough was clumpy and dry so I add enough milk to make to mix the dough well (wet dough appearance). Next I use a soup spoon. I scooped each dumpling up and rolled it in flour. Then I dropped the dumplings in boiling stock. when the dumplings start to get soft, they are done. Drop them in the crock pot or stew.

Notes: using a lid will make a mess. I never cover my soup pots. Same goes for making gnocci.

I'm a nanny for a family with 8 kids....I made a batch of chicken & dumplings using this recipe that should have left a ton of left overs! Needless to say there wasn't even a bite left the next day!  I also took the advice of using half butter half shorting and I also used buttermilk for a lil extra flavor! These are soooo simple and packed full of flavor you can easily add any number of herbs & spices to suit the needs of any recipe you'd like to jazz up with an nice homemade county feel. Soooo yummy!

This recipe is easy as can be.  I used butter flavored Crisco shortening.  The chicken stock was very flavorful, which made the dumplings that much better.  This is the first time I rolled dumplings and I will do these again!

I wanted a quick dumpling soup recipe to use up the remaining cans of chicken broth I had from Thanksgiving. This dumpling recipe is GREAT as a quick soup. It only took 30 minutes tops and it was satisfying. I used 1 box and 3 cans of chicken broth, parsley flakes, shredded chicken breast (had extra chicken after I made quesadillas) salt and pepper. Boiled it. Made the dumplings and cooked until it's consistency was just like chicken and dumplings. It was delicious! My only complaint about this recipe is the dumplings weren't as firm as I like them. They were a bit soft and you can forget about them being solid to reheat them. Either way, these were great the way I made them and I WOULD give this recipe to a friend. Thanks for sharing, Jessica!

My lovely Mother made great chicken and dumplins - we lost her in '06  - i made these this year at TG and they are as close as i'll ever come to Mommas! I did decrease the baking powder as i didn't want a puffy dumplin - i also had to incorporate some extra milk to get the dough to the consistency i needed.  careful not to over work your dough or the dumplins will be tougher than you want them- roll as thin as you can! over all 5 stars - i'll be making it again as my sons licked the pot and fought over the last helping!

I gave this recipe to my mother and she followed it exactly.  The dumplings melted in your mouth!  Her chicken and dumplings were awesome and we've raved for days!  Mom mixed a can of cream of chicken with two cans of chicken broth and about one tablespoon of chicken base (add to taste).  She added diced celery and onion.  When the celery started to become tender she put in leftover roasted chicken that was chunked and the dumplings till they were cooked through.  Best flavor ever!

I've been searching for a recipe that ressembled my mother's . . . and this came incredibly close!  I did use butter flavored Crisco, which I think was the difference.  Next time I will try it with regular Crisco, instead.  I boiled the dumplings in my famous "Dirty Chicken Broth," along with three chicken breasts, which I later shredded.  The broth thickened up nicely . . . and in my part of the world, this is what we call Chicken Pot Pie . . . no pie crust, please.  Thanks so much for helping me ressurect an old childhood favorite!

Perfect! I have tried countless times to make drop dumplings and always seem to end up with sticky balls of half cooked dough. I made these the other day and the first comment from my husband was... "those don't look like dumplings" (as if my other attempts had!) After cooking these with chicken and veggies in broth, noticed that both he, and my picky 7 year old daughter wanted seconds, not of the chicken mind you, just of these yummy dumplings! Thanks for a terrific recipe that I will use over and over, no need to search further. Oh yeah, I also added a bit of parsley for color!

These rolled dumplings were a big hit at my house.  I was told I should can these and sell them.  I have tried many bisquick type dumplings and I love those kind but had someone in the house who wanted me to make dumplings like Cracker Barrels.  I looked around on all recipes and most recipes are for the other kind.  I was glad to find these as I was told these are better than cracker barrels.  I followed recipe for dumplings but did my own broth.  I cooked a whole chicken in the crocpot.  Removed bones and shredded chicken and out in pan on stove then added these wonderfulo dumplings.  They were light and fluffy with just the right amount of texture.  Thanks again for a great recipe I will make again.

Delicious dumplings. I recommend rolling them out as thin as possible (around 1/8" or less) before cutting, or they will be too heavy. Rolling them out 1/16"-1/8" gives you a light, noodle-like dumpling. These are NOT the puffy, biscuit dumplings. These are dense and taste more like homemade pasta.

Wonderfully delicious! I have tried other recipes from this site and I believe I have found my favorite recipe.  After reading another reviewers comment about being too salty, I only added 1/2 tsp and they were great.  Thank you, thank you!

I made these to cook in pork stock instead of chicken broth, and added fresh sage, rosemary and thyme from my garden. They came out excellent.

When I read the recipe, I was thinking, ok, something this simple can't be that good.  Ok, it was better than good it was GREAT.  I used water instead of milk, b/c my daughter is allergic to milk.  It turned out great, I added shredded cooked chicken thighs to ours.  I will deffinately make this again!

Excellent recipe! I added a bit of chopped parsley in the dough. Instead of rolling I tore the dough and spread it to thin rounds and tossed them right to the boiling pot of chicken soup. Super easy to make such a good winter soup on a cold night!

I've been using this recipe for several years now and it is wonderful. Really easy to make and is always a big hit with my family too. I saute chopped onions, celery, and carrots first then add the chicken broth. Then I add 1 tsp each of dried thyme and rosemary while the dumplings are cooking. Finally I add pulled chicken meat and some fresh ground black pepper. If I don't cook the chicken myself a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket works great. This is my wife's favorite cold weather dish.

I've never had dumplings before but I wanted to try them. Based on the reviews I thought I would try these, they were yummy and my 7 year old daughter loved them. I put them in some homemade chicken soup. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I didn't have shortening and used butter and it seemed fine! Thank you!

These are the BEST dumplings recipe I have found.  They don't fall apart and melt into the stock like a lot of dumpling recipes do.  They are perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I will be making these again and again!

Since everyone else seems to love this, I mist have done something wrong. They did not puff up at all and I rolled them nice and thin.  They turned out kind of tough and pasty. I followed the recipe exactly, but my dough was very stiff, nearly impossible to incorporate all the flour.  Maybe I worked it too much, but it wouldn't have stuck together any other way.  My husband loves this type of dumpling, so I'll try again and update if it turns out any better.  It was edible, but not good.

I've made these a few times and they are fantastic.  Very simple and fun for the kids to help with.   I like to make these with my left over roasted chicken or even thanksgiving turkey or Christmas ham.  Just throw the meat and dumplings into a hot chicken broth and you're done about 10 minutes later.  Easy southern favorite.

Pretty easy to make, and very tasty! I used whole wheat flour, and they were delicious.  They did puff quite a bit, but I had been warned of this in the reviews, so I rolled mine to about 1/8" and cut them smaller than recommended , and they were fine.  I added some shredded,  pre-cooked chicken and veggies when they were done cooking, and  had a great soup/stew.

Very good recipie. I've been looking for one that didn't use baking mixes, unsuccessfully. Finally found this one and it was perfect. I didn't have two cans of chicken broth, so I substituted one chicken boullion cube and one teaspoon of the southwest shaker boullion to give it a little kick. Absolutely wonderful.

These are good dumplings, but you can make it easier by getting refrigerated pie dough at the grocery.
I let mine set for ten minutes and lay out on a cutting board dusted with flour, dust some flour on top and then cut into strips.
Two crusts are included per box. I add both crusts to a chicken broth made with a half or whole chicken in a slow cooker.
Easy.

Best dumplings. I doubled the recipe and used 2 boxes of chicken broth. I sautéed some celery in butter with a teaspoon of poultry seasoning before adding the broth. 
My family secret for dumplings....roast the chicken and use some of the fat( schmaltz) in the dough. Never lift the lid until your dumplings are done.
Labeled broth and dumplings over shredded roasted chicken.

I used to use can biscuts 'cause I'm a lazy 'ol cus, but after using this recipe, will never make 'em any other way.  They need to be rolled thin, as others have stated and I add herbs.  Terrific!

I've had this recipe saved since 2006. It's my very first recipe saved in my box on AllRecipes. My dad says it's the best Chicken & Dumplings he's ever had, and that's the highest of praise from an 83 year old Texas cowboy. Thank you for sharing this. I'm on my way to his house right now with a huge batch of it. He's been battling cancer for a year and just started chemo again, so I know he'll love it one more time.

Almost like Grandma used to make! She never measured anything, so her recipe is hard to follow.   I made half a batch, except I used the full 1/2 cup milk.  No problems rolling out.  Mixed them up in my Little Oskar food processor.  Definitely need to roll them thin.   They were very good and I wanted more, but a half batch was plenty for two people.

I made this as written and found it too salty for my taste. I also had trouble with getting the dough to stick together but that's probably my lack of "dumpling" skill.

My daughter and I had a great time making these. They are so simple. We had butter flavored shortening, added some cracked pepper and onion powder. Delicious! They need to be cut thin if you want a noodle -like dumpling ( as she states, 1/8"). We are originally from the North so we don't mind the thicker 'dumpling'. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. We were on a Sunday cooking roll!!

These dumplings cooked well and tasted great, but they were kind of heavy even though I rolled them out thinly.  What could I do next time to make them fluffier inside?

I rolled these as thin as I could and they still puffed up a bit. I cooked them in two batches and ended up needing more broth. Next time, I will use three cans of chicken broth and will cook them all at the same time rather than in batches. (I always add 1/4 tsp. poultry seasoning to the broth because I like that seasoning in my dumplings.) These had a good flavor.

I doubled this the very first time I tried it, since I have a big family, but I don't think I needed to, I had alot of dumplings!  Very easy and yummy!  I did wish I had rolled them thinner and cut them smaller though, as they plump up nicely. Thanks for a good 'comfort food' recipe!

My family loved this. Of course I tweaked it to my liking. I didn't use the baking powder. I put a half stick of butter in with the chicken broth. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the broth before adding the dumplings. It was yummy. Thanks to Jessica for the recipe.

My grandmother made the best chicken and dumplings.  I never watched her and the recipe passed on with her. With this as my starting guide, I can't go wrong. Thanks.

ALMOST as good as my MOM MOMS...( she (we)called it pot pie) She used Bisquick(instead of the flour) and so did I...when I was a small child, I remember getting to her house and running right into the kitchen and seeing all of these rolled out dumplings neatly lined up on a huge cutting board, ready to go into her broth and home raised stewing chicken. She didn't have a pastry cutter, but instead used 2 table knives which is what I did as well. I think that works better anyhow...Mom Mom's pot pie was my favorite food while growing up! Sure do miss her!

I made these tonight and they are just great!!  I like flat, chewy dumplings so I used just half of the baking powder recommended.  Otherwise, I kept to the recipe.  I dropped half of the recipe into a pot of chicken w/broth and am drying the other half.  Don't know how the dried half will turn out as I've not done this before but I'll learn something by trying.  This is the best dumpling recipe I've found and let me tell you, I've been looking for years.  Thanks so much for sharing.

These came out fantastic!  Very easy to make.  I did make a few of them a little too thick.  I suggest medium sized dumplings as they are not as gummy!  This is definitely a keeper! YUMMY!!

Very easy. I found the dough a little flaky so instead of rolling them out i just made little balls with my hands. They turned out very well.

It took me 55 years to try and make homemade dumplings.  These are excellent and easy.  I froze half the recipe and will let you know how they taste once reheated.

These were good, not great. I would advise using the largest diameter pot you have, to do as many in a batch as possible. The broth really thickens and has to be changed after about 2 batches of dumplings. I let mine cook about 15 minutes to get the right consistency.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!! I loved this recipe! When I made the dumplings I didn't think it was coming out right so I added a lil bit of garlic and onion powder. I also didnt have chicken boulion to give more flavor to the broth of the chicken so I added a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Its not your traditional dumplings but my family loved it. My papi(dad) isnt to big on dumplings but he said that he would definitely want me to make this one again! Thanks for this recipe! It was so awesome!

Today was the first time I ever made any kind of dumpling.  This was very easy, quick and tasty. I added it to my chicken soup recipe as a sub for the noodles.  My southern husband said the dumplings were excellent.  I used butter flavored crisco and a sprinkle of parsley and fresh ground pepper to this recipe.  I will make this again soon.

These are fantastic - by far the most tender, tasty rolled dumplings I've tried.  Handle the dough as little as possible and they'll melt in your mouth!

I made these for dinner tonight and they were a huge success.  My hubby said that they were just like his grandmothers!  I only made a couple small changes.  I used butter instead of shortening and I added a couple drops of yellow food coloring to the milk before adding it.  I did that because my dear hubby said that is how his grandma used to make them.  The looked nice and tasted even better!  Anyone looking for a great rolled dumpling look no further.  Needless to say this a KEEPER!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was I used butter instead of shortening. I was already making chicken & dumplings, but didn't want to use biscuits. This is a GREAT basic recipe to follow.

I have to say...in my family we always do drop dumplings.  However, because I have small kids rolled dumplings seem to work better.  This recipe is awesome.  My husband said it was the best chicken and dumplings I have ever made!!

I was not too happy, half of the dumplings turned to mush.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I turned it into  chicken pot pie becausethe broth became so thick.  Would an egg keep it together?

An hour ago I found this recipe. I threw together a pot of chicken soup from leftover chicken and veggies in the fridge, and added these at the end. This is my first attempt at dumplings, and I'll end my search here for the perfect recipe! So tender and tasty!

These are GREAT! Just how I like them! I added them to the Homemade Chicken Soup and it was wonderful! My husband is not a big fan of chicken and dumplings but he LOVED these. He even requested it for next week!

I made these for  a potluck for our church's game night  and was told they were the best they've ever had.  My husband even wanted to know what I had done different from my last recipe. Great flavor and texture. The absolute perfect rolled dumpling!

I will make it again. my suggestion is to use pastry dough blender, and don't be rough with the dough once you blend the milk in it. I roll dough between two sheets of parchment paper using rolling pin. I use pizza cutter to cut and then put in freezer a few minutes

I followed the recipe but had to do some finagling.  Didn’t have any chicken broth so I took a gamble and used chicken flavored bullion (I know, I know, but I live 30 minutes from the nearest store of any kind).  I put celery, carrots , poultry seasoning and rosemary as if I were stewing a hen (Also I used leftover turkey I had froze from Thanksgiving.  Let it simmer while I rolled out the dumplings.  Brought the broth to a boil,  dropped the rolled dumplings in and then covered the pot, turned the heat down to a slow simmer.  The family loved it and said it was the best Chicken & Dumplings I’ve ever made.  They have/had no idea I used turkey or cheat-a-broth.
Will definitely make this again!

11/27/18:  This makes a TON of dumplings.  I added it to soup instead of making a more traditional chicken and dumplings.  They tended to stick together with leftovers.  James REALLY liked these so I'll definitely make them again.  Perhaps add seasoning to the dumplings next time?

This recipe is a game-changer for me. I’ve always been a “drop dumpling” maker. My husband grew up eating rolled dumplings. For nine years, I’ve been trying to find a recipe that he likes. He’s incredibly picky. Finally, SUCCESS! I doubled it, and I don’t know how much liquid I used since it was broth from boiling chicken, but I’m sure it was more than double what was called for. Thanks, poster! ??

I, absolutely, love this recipe. It was super easy. I rolled my dumplings into little bowls and heavily seasoned them to add a magnitude of flavor. My family enjoyed it immensely. I pressure cooked some chicken to go with this so I could have homemade chicken and dumplings.  We had some the following day and they DO NOT like leftovers. I plan on making these again one day.

I actually cut the dumpling recipe in half. I am also all about flavors so I added half a teaspoon of black pepper, half a teaspoon of onion powder and half a teaspoon of garlic powder to the recipe. I rolled mine out and cut them and as the recipe said dusted them with a little extra flour which thickened the broth perfectly. Definitely would recommend this recipe!

I have lost my grandmother's recipe, but this one is similar (I think the proportions were different) and it came out similar, if a bit bland by themselves. Keep to the reccomended size for cutting as these will swell while boiling, and watch them so they don't sink to the bottom and stick.

I substituted the flour for gluten free  cup for cup flour, and it turned out fine. I just had to press the dough into patties because the GF flour didn't want to stick together. It cooked according to the recipe and hubby enjoyed it (also my picky eating princess), which is quite a plus!

If you like a rolled dumpling,  these are great!  I didn't  think they were  too salty at all. I cooked mine for about 8 or 9 minutes  but should have  gone at least 10. They still turned out super. Nice and tender.

I have been looking for a dumpling recipe that wouldn't dissolve when cooked.  These held up beautifully.  I made them with butter and all other ingredients as written.   I rolled them and cut them with a pizza cutter.  My search is over.  This is my dumpling recipe.

I had never tried making homemade dumplings before but these were super simple!  I didn't have any shortening so used the same amount of solidified coconut oil instead and they still came out perfect.  Melt in your mouth.

These are wonderful and easy to make. As another user commented they are very fluffy so roll them very thin. I used unsalted butter in place of the shortening and it worked out very well ??

Turned out great.  I doubled the broth and added two chopped up chicken thighs.  Maybe cut the salt in half next time.  I added 1/2 tsp of fine pepper and 1 tbsp of dried parsley.  3 of us and no left overs.  Perfect meal for a snowy day.

These were perfect. I used butter flavor shortening, 3/4 t. salt and added black pepper. Put dough in fridge wrapped in plastic for few hours before rolling. Rolled extra thin, cut with pizza cutter into one inch squares, perfect.

Very good - made the broth and added some diced celery and onions plus some shredded chicken.  Have made it several times and it's a family favorite.  I also use all butter and no shortening because I don't keep shortening on hand.  Works great.

This sounded like it was closer to our family recipe than anything else I could find. I added one egg, reduced baking powder to 1.5 tsp, and milk to 1/3 cup, and it was perfect.

Very easy to make and delicious. I used this dumpling with my leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I put a little of my leftover gravy in the stock. It made a thick yummy stew.

I have made this recipe a few times now, and one thing that I don't like is that after 8-10 minutes the dumplings are still raw in the middle. It takes almost an hour for them to cook all the way through, and I do roll them thin. The flavor and texture are good after cooking, but they aren't close to done after 10 minutes. The other negative is the shortening. Nothing but hydrogenated oils. I will need to try it with butter, or even regular oil and see if it turns out. This recipe is a great starter, but not a 5 star recipe.

I did not care much for this recipe. I wanted them to taste like my moms, and they didn't. I'll keep trying though. They were rather mushy without much form.

PERFECT! Exactly like my Grandma's too.  I used margarine instead for my first batch and it worked perfectly.  Shortening is excellent too. Thanks for the tip to roll them extra thin - they puffed up to the right thickness. WONDERFUL! Thanks so much. :)

My oh My!! These were awesome! I did need to add maybe 3 more tablespoons of milk. Like others have mentioned, I put them in the fridge while while chicken soup was cooking. I used a pizza cutter to make them the right size.

Easy to make!  My mom really enjoyed them.  I made them using vegetable stock because my husband is vegetarian, and everyone still liked them.  However, my mom requested that I use beef stock next time so that it would be like my grandma used to make.  Overall, I would recommend them!

This was the easiest and best dumping recipe ever. I rolled the dough out and used a pizza cutter to make squares or stripes. I had put three boneless skinless chicken breasts in the crockpot all day with some onion and poultry seasonsing, transferred chicken and broth to pot, and put on stove to boil. One boiling occured i dropped strips of dough in. Let cook for ten-ish minutes. Delicious dumplings.

I took the advice in the other reviews and cut the dumplings a little thinner...delicious! I also used double the broth that the recipe called for...the broth really makes it- I added a little garlic salt and onion powder for flavor.

These are wonderful! The only thing I did differently was use more broth, about 8 cups. Then transferred them to homemade chicken soup (I didn't want the soup thickened). YUMMY!

Great dumpling recipe, best I've ever made, all of my kids ate it!  I did cook the dumplings 5 minutes longer as they seemed to become more tender the longer they cooked, I think next time I will cook them 10 minutes longer than what the recipe says but a great recipe nonetheless!

Can throw some chicken in w/ the broth. I use whole wheat flour and butter (instead of shortening). I'm sure they aren't as flaky as a result, but are still fine.

Great base recipe. I would consider adding more liquid to the mix. Mine came out a bit too crumbly & wouldn't stick together. I also added some spices for flavor. But as a base recipe it's great. Thank you.

So easy to make and my husband says they taste just like his grandmother's recipe! I add them to slow-cooker chicken and dumplings recipe from this website (see my review and others for variations) in place of the canned biscuits and it makes an out-of-this-world comfort food.

These were exactly what I was looking for. When I make chicken and dumplings, I usually do the "drop by spoonful" dumplings.  My husband wanted the rolled ones, so I tried these and they turned out great. Thanks!

I have made this many times but I always add chicken and vegetables to make it into a main dish, I also add cream of chicken soup at the end to thicken it up so it is more like a stew.  Everytime I make it I get rave reviews.

Yum, so good.  This is the first time I've ever made rolled dumplings instead of drop dumplings.  I might make them this way every time now.

Great consistency and texture.  One of the best rolled dumpling recipes I've found.  I like to add lots of pepper and a couple of pinches of parsley for some color and additional flavor.

Fabulous with the "D'best Southern Chicken and Dumplings" recipe from this site.

OMG!OMG!OMG! These were absolutley the best. This is my new go-to recipe for my homemade chicken noodle soup. I used 3 TBS of butter instead of shortening. The noodles were velvety, smooth, and somewhat chewy. These are just so good!

Instant hit, and they took about 30 seconds to make. I even forgot the salt, and the whole family loved them. I had to add just a hair more shortening to get a cohesive dough, but this recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for posting.

Thank you for the recipe.  I found it easy to mix and very easy to roll out. My husband rated as close to his mother's.

Awful.  I followed the directions exactly and got little lumps of hot, wet dough.

This was a great dumpling recipe -- they taste just like the homemade dumplings I'm used to eating at my mom's.

The only way to make dumplings down south.
I like to add boiled chicken that is debone and slice up one or two hard boiled eggs. 
Great stuff.

They were okay.  I thought they were a bit mushy compared to egg dumpling recipes that I have tried.

Very good recipe and very easy.  The only change I would make would be to add less salt, as these were a little salty for my taste.
