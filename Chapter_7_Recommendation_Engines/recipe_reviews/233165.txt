I used a 9 x 13 pan and it worked just fine. The brownie actually came out nice instead of too thick. Crushing the Oreos is definitely not a requirement, and I actually like it better when the Oreos are just laid down under the brownie. If you forgot the Oreos like I did the first few times making it, it's perfectly fine with just the chocolate chip cookie and the brownie. My sister added chocolate chips sprinkled on top of the brownie layer for just that much more chocolate, and the melty quality of the chips work best when the slutty brownies were served hot. 

If  you're serving hot, with ice cream is the best way to go, but if you want nice squares, refrigerating for about half an hour and then cutting helps.

These are amazing. We used double stuffed Oreos and it was the best brookie I've ever had.

Better than ever brownies are yum, and then you can have them after feeding your brussel sprouts to the dog. They are a joy to eat, especially after working up a sweat just before convincing your teacher that an alien ate your homework. They are maybe the best brownies you will ever eat, they are so good. Use this easy recipe, and you will have a quick easy recipe, that you can serve for any party, potluck, dessert (they’re especially good with ice cream), or just give them to your new neighbors if you have some new neighbors. I made them extra chocolate-y by adding chocolate chips and bars. I also tried giving it kind of a fizz, by adding Coca-Cola, or Dr.Pepper. I  even tried making them taste like Godiva chocolates, by adding some white chocolate, too. I have entered these in many brownie contests, and won every single time. The judges said they were far above all the other recipes. I enjoyed selling them door to door, and I came out with an average of $12.75 a day. Sometimes I just whip up a normal batch to just snack on. It’s a joy to have them plain and simple, even though they’re good with changes. I made them low-fat, and they are still  good. Just add less fat and chocolate. They have great potential and good credentials, and they will please every time. I hope  everybody gives this good ratings, and they are better than other brownies because they have  caramel cookie layer, and crushed oreos. I am really glad I have this recipe, so here is the recipe i love that i

The only word I have for these is uber-brownies. We only had Dark Cocoa Powder, but I think it was just as delicious as it would have been with regular cocoa. We also didn't have any Oreos, but I think it would be better without anyway. These were very rich, but VERY good. I will keep this recipe.

Next time I think I will omit the cookies crumbs.  While cutting the bars the top separates from the  bottom of the bars. The cookie crumbs kept them from baking together.  While they taste ok the presentation is messy.  I’ll try making them again just not with the crumbs.

Either I did something wrong or it’s too rich for me. My mom helped me out and she thought the brownie batter was supposed to be boiling. I just went along with what ever she said and now the thing just tastes like eggs and butter.

Followed the recipe but used a 9x13 pan and it would not finish baking in the middle until a hour in the oven, when it came out it had no taste.
