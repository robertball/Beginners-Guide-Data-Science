I paired this with fresh berries and a goat cheese panna cotta as a dessert option for a recent event. It was very well received. Be sure to use a wine that you would like to drink because even with all the sugar and flavorings, the taste of the wine still comes through. I used a well-priced cab from Napa and reduced it to a syrup consistency. One change I will make for next time is to use a cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon. Then I will fish it out before serving and not be able to see the "grains" of cinnamon in the sauce. This one is a keeper.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I drizzled it over slices of butter cake topped with a scoop of french vailla ice cream. This recipe could not be easier and I didn't change a thing though I think any good red wine would be lovely. This will be a go to for a light but elegant dessert.

I cut the recipe in half because it was just for two people but this sauce is magical! I couldn't stop myself while enjoying it! I used Apothic Dark and drizzled it over shortcakes with strawberries and blueberries. So good!

I looked up this recipe to copy a dessert I had at a local restaurant. Take this syrup and pour it over dates and top with some whipped Marscapone cheese. Heaven!

I’m on a low carb diet, so I substituted stevia for the sugar and then used xanthan gum to thicken the sauce. It’s still probably not very low carb, but absolutely delicious!!!

I used this on top of cupcakes with Pinot noir buttercream. It was beautiful drizzled over the top. Unfortunately within a short amount of time, it was gone...some had run off and some seemed to have soaked into the buttercream. That being said, it still tasted amazing!
