Easy and if you have sliced mushrooms, fast. I halved the chicken for personal preference and added some leeks that I dried from the garden. Delicious, even before I decided to add the leeks.Thanks for this recipe!

This was an elegant dinner. I did not make pasta since we had it the night before. I made Ancient Grains , which I have bought at Costco. The mix of the grains with the chicken, the spinach and Dijon sauce was perfect. I also added 1/4 C of diced red pepper for color in the sauce. 
I will be making this when we have guests. Thanks for sharing.

All I did was thicken the sauce a little bit. It was very tasty. It's a keeper!

Minor adaptations but the sauce did not thicken as expected.  None the less, my family loved the flavor of the sauce and raved about the dish.

It was good.  It never thickened at all at the end and I finally added a little corn starch mixed with water to add a little thickness. I would double the spinach .  I also had made zucchini as a side dish and that mixed well with it.   Taste was really good.  I would make it again.
