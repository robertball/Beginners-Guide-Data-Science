I thought the taste was a little bland on this, but because my husband is so picky I didn't add the peppers which I suspect would have helped.  The thing about this that I loved was it was so easy to make.  I put the liquid in the freezer while I was shredding the meat and then skimmed the fat from the top.  I then put it back in the crock pot for about 30 minutes to reheat.  I will make it again simply because my husband liked it and it was easy.

Delicious! I took the provolone cheese suggestion and toasted it in the toaster oven until the cheese melted. My husband and I loved it and eat it that way every time we make slow-cooked beef. My already-picky-4-year-old even likes it!

My house smelled delicious for days.  I served this on crusty vienna rolls, with the juices as an au jus.

I would definitely make this again--it was so easy and tasty.  I couldn't find the pepper stir fry mix, so I just added a sliced green pepper.

These sandwiches turned out great.  I followed the recipe as written and my family asked for seconds.  There was enough meat leftover for the next day.

this has become my favorite recipe for italian beef, BUT i do not use the stir fry mix they suggest. instead i add a jar of mild pepperocini's with the juice, and it is the perfect thing to boost the flavor. i've made it without the pepperocinis too and it just wasn't the same. they make the recipe.

EXCELLENT! I was out of a seasoning mix I use and looking for a recipe that used the spices instead of a mix.  Found this one and deviated slightly.  I added an Aus Jur mix to the water and the last 30-45 min of cooking added some whole button mushrooms and served on the side with peppercinis.  So good! Lot of broth left for soup!

Awesome!  I used venison roast, and added an onion, cut in strips.  It was awesome.  No one could tell that it was venison.  Absolutely no gamey taste at all.  I slow cooked on high for about 5 hours, maybe a little longer.

I had very high hopes going into this one.  I made it for Superbowl Sunday.  It was ok.  Used 4.2 lb roast.  Cooked 9 hrs on low.  Came out perfect.  Flavor just wasn't there like I had hoped for.  There were no leftovers however.  Maybe less water would help this out.

I used fresh peppers but otherwise followed the recipe.  I thought it was great but my husband liked it better the next day when I turned it into bbq sandwiches by just adding a bottle of bbq sauce.

Excellent Recipe!! This was so fast and easy to make, My whole Family enjoyed it. I didn't add the stirfry mix to it though and it tasted just fine. I think green peppers and some jack cheese
would taste great on it also. Thanks for a great Recipe!!

I was not very impressed with this recipe. Granted I didn't use the peppers because I was out but still wasn't that great. I guess the peppers are relied on for most of the flavor because this didn't have much without them. About an hour before serving I ended up adding a jar of au ju gravy to help the flavor. Might make again with the peppers.

Followed recipe with these changes, substituted one half of the water with beef stock and I added a 10 ounce bottle  of  pepperoncini deli slices along with the brine and a container of Baby Bella sliced mushrooms. I cooked it for 9 hours in a slow cooker on low. Wow it was fork tender, the pepperoncini peppers and brine gave it a subtle peppery and slightly vinegary kick that Italian style beef, That I am accustomed to should have. Served on a hoagie roll with provolone slices on both halves that were broiled in the oven to melt. The broth made an excellent au jus dip.

I didn’t use frozen bell pepper stir-fry-mix, just slivered some fresh red bell pepper and onion and added it to the slow cooker.  I kept all ingredient quantities the same, but only used a 2-1/2 pound chuck roast.  Ended up with too much juice, so I just ladled off some of it, but the herb flavor really penetrated the beef nicely.  I know some reviewers found this recipe bland, but  I didn’t find that to be the case at all.  Good recipe, although this family still prefers a good old BBQ beef sandwich more than an Italian beef sandwich.  Just sayin’.........

This turned out very good. I had all the water/spices already in the crock pot when I realized I only had a 2.5 lb roast. It came out great--lots of flavor, a little too much water, but it was fine. Some reviews say it came out bland, so maybe use a smaller roast or double the other ingredients. I cooked it for 10 hours, and it was so tender.
