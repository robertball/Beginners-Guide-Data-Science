Fantastic!  I read about this recipe not having enough flavor, so I sauteed the onions and sausage together, then added the water once there was some browning on the sausage to give it more flavor ;)
Before adding more water, make sure to boil this first, mine had plenty.

Great recipe! Just made a few changes by adding 3 cans of low sodium chicken broth instead of water (leaving out the boullion cubes); skipped the tomato sauce but added the crushed tomatoes; skipped the rice (can add potato cubes during the last half hour of cooking.... for the consistency of a "stoup"....  A meal in itself with 'hard' bread.) Very tasty!

I had never had this before until my dad requested it for Sunday dinner (he was ill and I'd bring him Sunday dinner every week). He passed away before the next Sunday arrived, on 4/9/13. I made it anyway in his memory, and it was absolutely delicious! In a way, he left his mark by asking for that dinner because I'll think of him now and smile every time I make it. Thanks, Ludy!

My kitchen smelled soooo good while this was simmering.  Very easy.  I added two teaspoons of kosher salt and coubled the rice.  My Polish grandmother would have loved this one!

Wife was hinting that she would like sausage and cabbage soup (she told me to make it). I found this reciipe and chose to try this instead of our usual, and she is glad I did, so am I. As others have suggested I too sauteed the onion and sausage added some garlic some cumin. Used chopped tomatoes w/jalapenos. This really makes a lot. With the left overs I am going to add more rice and beans thicken it up to a stew consistancy and add dumplings. It is raining and chilly today....sounds like tonights meal. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Very good hearty soup.  I used 1-16 oz. can tomato sauce and 1-16 oz can crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Added a little more veggies and chopped garlic, along with a chopped jalapeno for some heat.  We enjoyed it!

I did the onions, carrots and celery in a small pan while I mixed the beans, stock, tomatoes and sauce in my crock pot.  I used canned chicken stock instead of water and cubes. Then I added little smokies (which is also a pound) to the pan to sort of brown them up.  I deglazed the pan with some of the chicken stock right into the crock pot.  I added cabbabe about an hour before serving.  Delicious!  Will make again

This is not my favorite cabbage soup recipe. I did use chicken broth and skipped the bouillon cubes, and I only used 1- 8 oz. can of the tomato sauce (I presume that 8 was a typo) and I thouht I bought a good sausage, but did not care for the flavor. I would suggest  cutting back a little on the sausage and chopping it up a bit after slicing it. Someone suggested adding potatoes, I think I would try that if I make it again.

LOVED this!!! :o) My hubby isn't a soup fan, but he really enjoyed this. I did make a few changes. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I sauteed about 5 minced garlic cloves and 1 medium onion before adding the kielbasa. Added the sausage and continued to cook for about 5 minutes. Instead of using crushed tomatoes, I used 3-12.4 (?) cans stewed tomatoes. I used a HUGE head of cabbage. Glad I did because still ended up with a bit of yummy liquid. This is a keeper!!!

I made this for my Christmas Eve dinner, and my dad LOVED it.  The carrots took longer to cook than the recipe says, but that could just be my cooking technique (I'm just getting into regular cooking).    This becomes very thick, so I did add some beef broth to it when I heated it up the next day.  Also, it says one head of cabbage...they should say one medium head because it's a lot of cabbage.

I made a few changes as I wanted more of a stew than a soup so I reduced the liquid to two cans of chicken broth but I still added one chicken bouillon cube for good flavor.  I also browned the sausage as per some other suggestions.  I added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and left out the beans.  I also used brown rice instead of white.  My husband, who normally doesn't care for anything other than "meat and potatoes", ate two big bowls and LOVED it!!!!  Will definitely make this again. I might add another link of sausage though.  Just to make it a little meatier. Oh I used the diced tomatoes with garlic and basil too.

WOW this was great!! I added a little extra sausage and the cabbage was probably on the large side... but it left no room for rice!!! That's okay I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much with the rice. I cooked the sausage in with the onions, and added a bit more thyme and a bunch of basil from the garden along with a hot pepper. Delish!!!

Absolutely delicious! I have 3 hungry guys so I doubled about everything except the cabbage because I had a nice big head of it already. Some people commented that it wasn't very flavorful so I used some garlic salt, some italian seasoning and added italian-seasoned diced tomatoes to the mix, and also used chicken broth in place of the water. It was bursting with flavor. I think browning the sausage with the onion helped immensely, and deglazing the pan and adding that to the soup all combined to make this one of the best soups I've made. Since I doubled it, I had tons left over, and it froze very well. It's one of those foods that tastes even better the second time it's heated. I love when my family makes a point of asking if I'll make it again. That makes it a 5 star for me!

Made this recipe today as the snow was falling heavily outside, and, enjoyed the fragrance of the ingredients simmering all afternoon in the soup pot!  :-). I didn't change much.  I did sauté the sausage, removed, and, then, I always sweat my vegetables prior to adding liquid ingredients; carrots first, celery, etc.  I also added an additional can of darined kidney beans.  This is a savory, healthy recipe when using low sodium products.

Very good recipe, I made this for myself and for my husband only and froze half. This is very hearty and tasty. I substituted garbanzo beans (chick peas) because I did not have red, I also added fresh basil as I served it.

This was my first time making this and turned out delicious! I of course modified it a little according what I had in my cupboard. Instead of a head of cabbage I used brussel sprouts and broccoli instead of celery and instead of crushed tomatoes i used a can of chopped tomatoes. It turned out more like a stew and my family loved it! Perfect for a cold winter evening

Original is so good. However I made it at least 50 times so there will be always some addition or luck of missing stuff at the time I am making it. Best change I made pound of Smoked Turkey Brest cut/sliced to 1/2 inch thick and then cubed (the thinking is sausage is everything leftover in it) 2-3 medium potatoes and at the end I add some Balsamic Vinegar if you like. Mushroom generous package was also great addition. My wife love it and on the end that is most important she love it. She is always on diet. In addition cabbage head can be hard to cut up, so sometime a get cut up cabbage in the bag about 3 lbs. as good as any.

Delicious...hearty and nutritious. Cut up the sausage and browned before adding to the vegetables. Did not use the full head of cabbage either. I prefer using a chicken leg and making my own stock ..also using 'saved veggie water' from other meals. Added a pinch of crushed red pepper and curry to bring out the flavor. Fire roasted diced tomato and used diced potato over rice, like my father used to make it. Oh...no beans.

This dish was so good that I could not wait to sign on to rate it.  This is delicious.  I used two packages of the Hillshire Farm Smoke Sausage, a few sprinkles of Cajun Seasoning for heat and omitted the carrots. Substituted black eye peas for the beans and used Chicken Broth intead of the boullion cubes.

I make something very similar to this using chicken stock instead of the water and cubes. I also add paprika and crushed red pepper. This adds a bit of spice flavor and a bit of a kick that goes great with the smoked sausage.

yum!! this was good and relatively easy to make (the prep took me a good 30 mins), i substituted 2 cups of organic chicken broth for the bullion cubes and added just a tablespoon of butter in with the onions. this made a HUGE pot, i followed the 8 serving directions and mine would easily serve 12 or 14 people. good flavor, just no "WOW" factor to earn 5 stars. i would add another sausage link, or even an extra pound of some spicy italian sausage.

Really good! I followed the recipe exact except for one thing. I only used half of a cabbage because a whole one would have been too much. The soup was not at all bland. You just need to put enough salt in, that's all. I could taste the complimentary seasoning of the bay leaf and thyme just fine. Great soup! Something different.

I doubled the rice - but my husband kept bugging me till I said it was done! The smell was sooo good! I am not a soup eater but had cabbage that I needed to use, found this recipe and I found a winner!

I added more smoked sausage, and replaced the  crushed tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also added a little, to taste, Cajun seasoning. It way wonderful.

Very hearty and delicious. I Used ingredients I had on hand so I substituted 16 oz tomato sauce plus 22 oz fire roasted tomatoes instead of 8 oz tomato sauce plus 28 oz crushed tomatoes. I also used celery salt and celery flakes in lieu of cut up celery. Was very delicious and filling. Would probably taste good with potatoes instead of rice.

Solid soup! My picky husband hates veggies and he loved this soup because of the hearty flavor even with some carrots and celery snuck in. Changes I made: browned the onions/ sausage with some minced garlic, used a handful of fresh thyme and 2 bay leaves, & added no salt until it was served (and we both found it didn't need any!). Take note - makes ALOT of soup so decrease the recipie if cooking for 2 or 3.

Only had a half head of cabbage, so I added some cauliflower.  Used diced tomato instead of crushed.  Will make again with entire head of cabbage.  May still add cauliflower.  May try with meats that aren’t processed.

my family loved it as did I! I used potatoes instead of rice and only 1 can of petite diced  tomatoes and no tomato paste. I also changed out the water for chicken broth and still used 1 beef buillon cube. I sweat the potatoes, onion, carrot, cabbage and sausage in the pot first until tender then add in everything else to boil and then sit on low for an hour or so. love how hearty the potatoes make it. I could eat this all day everyday yummy. so good.

I'm a foodie and I love to cook.  This had such great reviews I decided to try it. I made it according to the recipe.  I eat everything so not liking this soup was a surprise to me. I tried adding a variety of spices to a small pan of it at a time.  Cumin, turmeric, sumac, chili, garlic, thyme.  Nothing helped.  I still couldn't eat it.

I am doing Weight Watchers and this was a great recipe that fit right in with my plan. I was afraid it wouldn't have much flavor with so few "spices," but the flavor was wonderful. The tomato base was just right. I will definitely make this again and I have added it to my favorites list.

My family thought this was delicious and wanted another batch in the near future.  I do tend to like more intense flavors since I grow herbs and love to experiment with them- I add just-cut basil and lots of fresh thyme, along with whatever else strikes my fancy.  Don't be afraid to experiment!  The beauty of this recipe is in being such a great basic dish which you can then change to your own tastes.  I also used navy ns in place of the rice since I had a lot of dry beans on hand- that was also very popular.  Thanks for the good soup ideas Lucy!

Just to a boil.  Can't wait to have a bowl.   I added mushrooms to this soup.  I also just added more water and diced tomatoes and stewed tomatoes NO tomato sauce.  Enjoy....with a little Italian bread and butter!

Not my cup of tea. Too much tomato. If I made it again I would use less tomato sauce.

My  husband and I loved this hearty soup! Having never made cabbage soup before, I didn't know what to expect, but I wanted to use up the cabbage I had from coleslaw. I made it as given and we were very pleased.

I made this and the family loved it.  I browned the sausage (as suggested by another reader) and substituted a 6-oz can of tomato paste when I discovered I was out of tomato sauce.  I served it with red pepper flakes at the table for those who wanted to kick it up a notch.  This goes in my monthly rotation.

Made some changes. Sautéed the onion, sausage, carrots and celery to get some color. Added boxed low sodium chicken broth, one 14oz can of tomatoes and small can of tomato sauce, cabbage and spices. Brought to boil. Instead of rice added 2/3 cup dried spazel noodles. Simmered 1 hr. Total yumm!

This one is a real winner.  I used Cajun Chicken Sausage that I browned first and Black Eyed Peas with Jalapenos instead of red beans cause that's what I had in the house. Used Chicken Broth and Vegie Broth instead of water.  VERY flavorful soup. I'm glad this makes a large batch because I'm putting a bunch away in the freezer for another day.  Can't wait to taste the 'next day flavor' from this one. Great recipe!

Made this really nice and hearty.  Didn't have beans so used  potato indstead of beans in the r recipe. I used Savoy cabbage instead of white and it was fine instead.  I added green bell pepper to it for tartness and I like the taste of it.  So all in all I can really recommend this recipe and use what vegetables you got.  I browned the sausage and redonion for added taste as one of the other makers suggested.  Great flavour.

Delicious! I made it with sausage for my boyfriend and I, and made it vegetarian for my parents (I use vegetable broth in everything!) Fun to make! My only thing is that the pot I used to make it in burned some of the rice. So I'll have to put a fair amount of oil in next time. By it makes for a good one pot recipe

Best soup ever according to hubby! I didn't put in rice and used chicken stock for water and bouillon cubes.  Also used sweet Italian chicken sausage squeezed out of the casing.  I will definitely make again.

I made it just like the recipe said to, except the head of cabbage I used was very large so I had to add a little extra water.  My daughter who does not like cabbage ate a large bowl of this soup and loved it. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again. So give me a few weeks and I will make it again.

I used farmers sausage and pasta sauce in place of tomatoes, as that is what I had on hand.  Used chicken stock in place of water. Good flavour.  With the leftovers: added a bit more chicken to loosen it up and served over rotini pasta. Sprinkled with parmessan cheese.  Very good.

Great recipe.  I followed the advice of others and used chicken broth and water as opposed to just water.  I omitted the boullion.  My PICKY eater husband, who LOVES soup, but generally dislikes my homemade soups really liked this.  I did use shallots as opposed to onion, b/c of allergies.

This is a very good soup that we all love - I've made it twice now. Very hearty and warming on a rainy cold day! As others suggested, I used a box of organic chicken stock in place of the water and bouillon cubes. I also used butter instead of the vegetable oil, and cooked the onion well before adding the sausage. We don't all like rice in the soup, so I made brown rice on the side for an option instead of putting rice in the soup.

Terrific on a cold evening! I sauteed the onions, carrots and celery until soft, then added the sausage and let it brown. Added the cabbage and let it wilt, then added the tomatoes, rice and bay leaf and enough water to cover, making sure to stir well to get the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Skipped the beans, bouillon and tomato sauce, but added a dash of soy sauce for a umami hit. My boys didn't want the soup, so I browned the other half-pound of the sausage (I cut this recipe in half) for them, then deglazed that pan with a bit of water and poured that into the soup pot. Just needed some hot crusty rolls and dinner was served! 

Husband said he would have liked potatoes in it, but I thought it was perfectly hearty and filling without it. (Men.)

Very excellent soup!! The only thing I added was a dash of red pepper flakes to give it some heat! Loved it and will be making again for sure!

I liked this very much.   Super easy and lots of flavor. I sauteed the onion, a little garlic, the carrots and the celery. Then added everything except the beans.  I added them a few minutes before serving the soup. I did use beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I also substituted a medium sized cubed sweet potato and a medium sized white potato for the rice.  I just wanted to use them.

Quick, easy, tasty using basic ingredients most people probably have on hand.  I had everything except cabbage, so I threw in a big bag of frozen brussel sprouts that I already had in the freezer.  I threw in leftover white rice from last nights takeout chinese dinner at the end too. Teenagers loved it.

I was short on time, so I used a pressure cooker and was finished in 1/3 of the time. Cook the onions in oil until brown, add meat and all ingredients to the pot, putting cabbage in last. secure lid and bring to pressure. Cook for 20 minutes at 15psi. Dish turned out wonderful! 
The only change I would make is to add more sausage.

We loved this recipe, I added extra tomato sauce and more water.  I also used smoked turkey sausage to keep it healthier.  It was more like what Rachel Ray calls Stoup!  Yum-oh!

This was a fantastically simple and delicious recipe! We did not change a thing but I can see where you could easily use different ingredients based on what you have in the pantry.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a hit! My kids even liked it and they are pretty picky. It isn't my little one's favorite but at least she ate it (she said "This isn't too bad"). I ended up not adding the tomato sauce just because I was out of it without realizing. I did add 2 cloves of garlic but it could have used one more I think. I also added a couple of pinches of basil. I substituted smoked turkey sausage for a healthier alternative. Then I served it all with garlic bread. Very yummy!
