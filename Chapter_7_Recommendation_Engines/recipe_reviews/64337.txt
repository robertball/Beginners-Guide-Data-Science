I don't know what everyone is raving about.  You can DEFINITELY taste the tuna in these burgers.  Mine also didn't turn out very moist, just a very dense, dry burger that stunk like tuna when reheated.  I put everything together like it said, but something went wrong.  I won't be making these ever again - a waste of tuna and hamburger.

The burgers weren't 'bad', but not homeruns (as my husband likes to say).  I think we'll stick with Montreal Chicken Seasoning for our burgers.

I thought this seemed so odd but had to try it anyway. I'm glad I did! Very juicy and didn't fall apart. I did let the mixture sit, covered, in the fridge for about an hour as others mentioned. The flavors melded together wonderfully! We could taste both meats and loved it! I've had requests for these again, and my family never asks to have anything. I always have to decide what to make on my own, so it's a nice change for something to be requested! Great job Bill and keep your wonderful recipes coming!

Had to try this one, glad I did. Would have rated it a 5 if it was not so easy to fall apart. Fortunately I resolved that problem by adding an egg and a little seasoned bread crumbs. I will definitely make again, I have a few variations in mind. Thanks Bill!

Man, Bill, do you know what you're doin' or WHAT???? These were soooo excellent.  Everyone loved them and you don't even taste the tuna.  A little healthier than an all-beef burger with ALL the taste.  The relish and onions add great flavor.  Thanks, Bill!

I made these because of the unusal ingredient mix.  These were good but not the most exceptional burgers I have had.  Admittedly, they tasted a lot better than they sounded when I read the ingredients.  Very moist.  I could still taste the tuna (but probably because I knew it was in there more than anything). I will make these again so my dad can try them - they seem like something he would really enjoy them.

I liked the sound of this, but did make quite a few alterations.  I used the minced beef with 1 med finely chopped onion and 1 finely chopped red chili, mix in 1 beaten egg and 1 tblsp of flour to bind.  Roll into balls and then flatten with palm of hand to make into patties (deep/shallow fry or BBQ). keep the sweet pickle as relish along with a tub of coleslaw.  Use the tuna with a small tin of sweetcorn (drained), add black pepper and chopped fresh coriander.
Make a fresh salad of chopped lettuce, avocado, small chunks of tomato and cucumber a little spring onion and a little fresh chopped pinapple (dressing of your choice).  Follow with fresh fruit salad and Ice cream - Yum. (you can put the tuna and seetcorn in the salad and use it to fill the burgers),

These were great!  They dont really taste like tuna; it really justs kind of lightens the flavor of the beef.  I made mine on the stove top.  Next time I will let them sit for in the fridge for a little bit so that hold together a little bit better as they were hard to turn.

This was really great - I did not have ground beef, or relish so used GROUND PORK added a large egg -  the tuna I used was in water - DEFINATELY WILL DO AGAIN - it turned out moist and you really did not know whether it was meat or fish - I think the sweet pickle  relish would be better used as a topping not actually mixed in.

Mmmm...these were yummy!  A nice change from the plain old hamburger.  The tuna gives it a great flavor.  I only used 1 lb.burger and only half an onion.  I still may cut down the onion some more next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Who would have ever thought that Tuna and Beef would make such an outstanding combination.  Not over-powering at all and holds it's flavor well when topped with Tomato, Lettuce, onion & cheese.
Now, I will have a very tasty treat while camping instead of the same old burgers. YUM!

I don't eat hamburgers and I loved these!  One was more than filling for me, and my boyfriend raved!  A little crumbly on the grill, but if he left them alone probably would have cooked better.  Easy, tasty, awesome recipe!

This was a great recipe!  I used chopped dill pickles and added some extra tuna.  They had lots of flavor and were really juicy.  I made about 14 smaller burgers and they tasted even better warmed up the next day.  Great recipe -- thanks!

These burgers were simple and delicious.  My husband doesn't really care for tuna but he loved these burgers.  I didn't have sweet relish on hand but had dill and they still tasted wonderful.

Bill, I made your burgers into a meatloaf and it turned out well, nice and moist and a great blend of the two meats.
I served it with homemade tartar but the hubby is a die hard ketchup fan and refused to have it with anything but.
I had my portion straight up and I give it 4 stars... it was a very nice change from our lunch time routine.

I'm ratng this soley on my boyfriend's taste buds. I wasnt so fond of it but he raved about them. I also am not a huge fan of the flavor of hot tuna.

This is a great way to introduce fish into your diet.  I didn't tell my son until he was done and he said they were good.  I just wish he liked relish and onions.  That would've taken these burgers to the next level.

It was the most delicious burger I've ever had. They fell apart a little. Only downside was the indigestion the beef/fish combo gave me. I don't know if I'll make them again since I don't particularly enjoy being woken up in the middle of the night with severe indigestion and gas, but they really were delicious.

PS I left out the relish because I do NOT like pickles, but they were still really good.

I thought something was fishy about this recipe when it was pointed out to me by happschmoopies. This was faceless at the time so I decided to give it a go. For taste I would give it five stars but for directions only 4. These definitely need a binder. Don't even try them without a binder or you will just have a crumbly mess on your hand. I noticed that some reviews said that these tasted too fishy. Well I suppose if you are using cheap tuna. Tuna shouldn't taste fishy, it should taste like tuna. I used solid white tuna packed in water to which the tuna complimented the beef. If you are looking for a juicy drip down your arm burger this isn't for you. The tuna does absorb some of the juiciness. Nevertheless a good and tasty burger. Thank you WHATS HIS FACE for something different for a change.
