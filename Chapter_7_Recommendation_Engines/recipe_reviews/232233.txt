Easy recipe to make for a large group of hungry people. I substituted mushrooms for quartered artichoke hearts and browned the sausage separately as the first step, then sauteed the onion, garlic and peppers in a small bit of the reserved fat from the sausage.  From there it was just a matter of adding everything else and letting it simmer. A new favorite for our house.

I didn't have any cans of tomato sauce or tomato paste but I did have diced tomatos and spaghetti sauce. Didn't have any mushrooms or cheese but this turned out pretty great. I'd give it a five if I liked spaghetti more, but I don't its just what I had to make.

Cut recipe in half because 2 adults and one kid in this family and it made plenty with leftovers. Delicious, I did add 2 tsp of sugar because I found it a bit tart. Still loved it!

SUPER GOOD AND TASTY. As weâ€™re Chinese family we seldom eat western. However when my dad, who usually dislike spaghetti, tasted it he said it is Super tasty and he said in the future if I ever made spaghetti he would like it by this recipe. ^^

Very nice, traditional spaghetti recipe. Next time, I'm not gonna add salt cause it's already salty enough.

I added about two teaspoons of sugar because it was a bit too tangy for my taste. My son liked it fine before the added sugar. The best part about this recipe was that it was a little different from our usual spaghetti.

My husband loved it! I read the other reviews before making it. I didn't add olives. I chopped up a tomato and added it. I followed the recipe more of less and it was delicious. I have leftovers.. can't wait because I know it will taste even better the next day!!

Followed recipe as closely as I could based on ingredients I had. Subbed red bell pepper for green; no mushrooms; no fresh tomatoes so used a can of diced; only had 1 can of sauce so used 1 can of crushed tomatoes as well. Came out a touch acidic so I added a small cooked beet diced, which helped balance it. Didn't add salt but had thrown in some leftover Parmesan. Served over whole wheat spaghetti. Yummy! Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.
