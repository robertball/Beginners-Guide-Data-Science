Really nice flavours. I used left over salmon and turned out amazing. I also used a toasted bun as I didnâ€™t have any English muffins. This recipe has a lot of flavours. I would make again.

This is a tasty way to eat tuna! It has SO much flavor going on I didn't think to add salt. I did toast my English muffins first. I had a little too much liquid in the sauce -even after draining the tuna - so I think maybe another can of tuna may be needed.
