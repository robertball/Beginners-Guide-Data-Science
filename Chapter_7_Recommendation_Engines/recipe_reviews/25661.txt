This recpie was great! My husband I ate it for 3 days straight!  The only changes I made were I used ground turkey breast instead of beef to make it lower in fat, I omited the peppers and used Rotel. We topped it with shredded cheddar and crushed up tortilla chips! It was delicious!

This soup is really yummy and on the spicy side. I didn't realize that the Serranos would make it that hot. I also make 10 serving size pot of it so next time I will use 3-4 peppers instead of 6. Great flavor my family likes this recipe a lot!

This is a great change from chili.  I used left over shredded beef instead of ground beef.  Ro-tel brand diced tomatoes w/green chili peppers and chili beans instead of pinto beans. Didn't have pinto beans on hand.  This is so easy and everyone thought it was GREAT!

Such a versitile soup/base - can mix up the meat, type of beans and veggies, even seasonings a little to adjust to what's on-hand! We keep some in the freezer in individual serving sizes because it's so good, cheap, and easy! One of my all-time favorite soups! (We like it served with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and tortilla chips!)

I made this in a half batch.  It's good.  Not as good as some other recipes, but tasty nonetheless.

Definitely better with corn chips than by itself.  I prefer the tortilla soup over this, and chili over this as well.

I enjoyed the ease of this; especially being able to cut it down in half. I kept out the water so it was stew-like and I could pass it off as "chili." We ate it poured over tortilla chips ( My spouse said Fritos would've been perfect. Nobody is raving about it, but everybody got seconds.

My family’s favorite cold weather meal! I use ground turkey rather than ground beef and top it off with a little cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream! I love that we can eat it for 3 days straight and not get sick of it. One of the best finds on allrecipes.com

This is a tasty soup but I did make some changes.  I omitted the serrano peppers and used Rotel for the tomatoes (could have also added canned chiles).  I used black beans and reduced the amount of extra water.  I also had cilantro and lime on hand from another recipe and added some of each.  Last, I added sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese when serving.  I served with Tostitos Scoops.  There are so many potential variations, but the important ingredients are the ranch dressing mix and taco (or chili) mix.

This was fantastic!  I did not do the peppers because of my kids - but instead I added a can of undrained rotel tomatoes and used chili beans instead of pinto as I had them onhand.  I put  tortilla chips and shredded cheese on the table to add if desired.  Both my husband and I loved it, and one of the two children went back for seconds.  Yummy!  Perfect for a rainy day.

the family LOVED this soup. The peppers give it a bit of a kick, but I think you could use  a can of Rotel as well. Also, I used a can of chilli beans and a can of pintos. Next time I'll try black beans. This one's a keeper.

Wow! This soup was really tasty.  I substituted a can of Chipotle peppers for the Serano's and it was still a little too hot (and I am from Texas).  If you don't like spicy food leave the chili's out, otherwise it is a great soup!

Very good. I didn't have the ranch so I left it out. It was good without, but I will try it with next time.  I ate it with tortilla chips, and my fiance ate it with a grilled cheese. To each his own!

This was very good but I used organic vegetable broth instead of water to pump up the vitamins for my 3 kiddos.  We served it with tortilla chips and everyone ate, even the 2 year old!

I used canned black beans, I also used 4 chicken thighs in place of ground beef. Awesome!
