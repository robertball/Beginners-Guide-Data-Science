Whoa this was fantastic! I omitted the jalepeno because once I tasted the Rotel I saw that it was plenty spicy (and I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice). I cut the bacon into small pieces and sauteed in a hot skillet. Once the bacon was cooked, I removed it with a slotted spoon and instead of using butter, I used some of the bacon grease to cook the onions, garlic, and red pepper. I followed the recipe after that and I was thoroughly impressed. Thank you so much for sharing. I will serve this alongside a Mexican spiced chicken.

This is a must have every New Year!  My family loves the spice.  Our kids come home every year for this family tradition.

I made this for our tradition New Year meal. I didn't use black-eyed peas from a can though. I bought dry, soaked overnight and cooked them in the morning before preparing this dish. I also only used one cup of rice. I wish I could give this a higher rating, because I really don't like black-eyed peas, but enjoyed this. I will make it again next year.

Great and simple recipe. I adapted by using red rice (healthier), another kind of beans, and I stirred in some left-over taco saus. Delicious.

This recipe is delicious.  I didn't have black-eyed peas so I used a can of great northern beans.  Just the right amount of everything.  I did get black-eyed peas to try the next time.  There certainly will be a next time.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Ashley B.

Very good.  Spicy?  Yes!  That can be toned down though to suit your tastes.  So easy!  I used some leftover ham chunks instead of the bacon.  Delicious.  Thanks!

Whole family liked it. Since they don't enjoy super hot, subbed small can of mild green chilies for jalapenos and can of regular diced tomatoes for Rotel. Thanks!

It doesn’t get better than this a simple recipe that tastes great and is healthy! I used green peppers and a can of regular diced tomatoes because that’s what I had and omitted the bacon to make it vegetarian. I also used canned Embasa brand jalapenos escabeche that have carrots and onions in it. The carrots added a wonderful color and taste! Thank you for sharing this recipe and I love the name change!

Loved it!!  Didn't change anything.  Saved the juice from the drained Habaneros to add some salt and viniger and use for hot sauce later.
