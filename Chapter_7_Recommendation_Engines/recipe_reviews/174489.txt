THE RECIPE IS GOOD!  ADDED GARLIC POWDER, BASIL AND OREGANO TO THE CHEESE MIXTURE AND LET IT REST IN THE FRIDGE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR TO MELD THE FLAVORS. VERY GOOD- WILL MAKE AGAIN.

This is a very easy, fairly quick recipe.  I added some fresh basil and garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  Very good!

This was easy to make and was great for my New Year's dinner. I just substituted my own sauce for the store-bought kind in the recipe.

this recipe looks good but watch the calculator when you double it -- it shows 80 cups Shredded Parmesan cheese instead of 1 cup...

My family enjoyed this. It was simple to prepare (we doubled the recipe). I added oregano, salt, and garlic powder for add'l flavor. Would probably make again.
