I added 1-1/2 tsp. salt & used 12 whole eggs (not just egg whites). We have turkeys & chickens & I'm always looking for recipes that are simple & use both ingredients. I think I will make the recipe again but with 2 c. mozzarella cheese added to the middle layer

Dish was very easy to make. Incredibly tasty. The mix of sweet and spicy from the sausage and crushed red pepper is spot on. Only change I made was I did not use 16 oz of breakfast sausage. I used two boxes which are about 12 oz and it was plenty.   I will make it again.
