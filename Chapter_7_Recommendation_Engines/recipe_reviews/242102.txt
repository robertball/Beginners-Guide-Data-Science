This is a fantastic rub. I let it sit overnight with my spareribs tightly wrapped in plastic. I did these slow & low in the oven for 2.5 hours, then finished them up on the grill. Fabulous flavor!

Loved this (kids less so).  Doubled the recipe for two racks to make it nice and thick.  Cut chili powder in 1/4.  Changed cooking to 3.5 hours at 225 with grill finish. Mmmmm!

I went by what the rub recommended and was skeptical by the ingredients. Did the rub last night and just got done with dinner. I'll start by saying the ribs were great. Everyone agreed they were very sweet. I think maybe letting them sit over night and then remove a significant portion of the rub and brush with BBQ sauce then wrap and cook. I run mine at 265 degrees for a full 3 hours. Jump them to the grill for 5 on each side and put them out.

This is a review for the rub only, since we didn't follow the cooking method.  I was a little wary of some of the rub ingredients, but our spareribs had a really good flavor.

I took the suggestion of many and cut down on the amount of chili powder. I add too much seasoning salt but that worked out. also added some smoked spice. My boyfriend loved this recipe and devoured them, next time i would cook them on a rack.

I did have to omit the garlic due to an allergy, but I don't think it would have improved this much.  It's edible, but really nothing special and it took a lot of spices to make it.  The cooking method did make a nice tender rib though.

The ribs were too hot to eat. I love spicy food and I could not handle these ribs.

The only changes I made was cooking the ribs about an hour longer due to temperature variations with my oven. I will definitely make these ribs again.

Good rub - decreased the spice as was for company - used in stuffed ribs. Good flavour.

I cut the chili powder in half and it burned my mouth so bad I couldn't eat the ribs.
