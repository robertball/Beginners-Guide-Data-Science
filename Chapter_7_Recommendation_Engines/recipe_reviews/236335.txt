I forgot to write about it. I made it a week ago and it was very good. I didn’t follow exact because i isn’t measure my ingredients. And i forgot the vanilla extract. And used vanilla almond milk instead of soy. Still very good.

Great recipe for virgin pina coladas! Tastes just like the ones we had on our honeymoon in Jamaica!
