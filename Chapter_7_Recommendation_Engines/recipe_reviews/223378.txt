Instead of Miracle Whip, I used Hellman's mayonnaise. I did not add the whole amount, I folded in a little at a time until it was the consistancy I was looking for. I also added in a good amount homemade DRY ranch dressing mix. Very tasty. My husband says this was even better after dinner, as a midnight snack. The longer it sits, the better it gets.

I tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago and the whole family loved it! I actually cut the recipe in half because I was afraid my family wouldn't like it. Boy, was I ever wrong! They were mad because I didn't make more! LOL...I'll definitely be making again!

I made this recipe for my family bbq, and it was a hit! Everyone was asking for seconds, and there was none left! What the recipe doesnt mention is how big you cut the potatoes into cubes. about 1in to 1 1/2 in cubes. not too small, because when you mix all ingredients together, they might mash, turning into mashed potatoes. Also my bf and I love bacon, so sometimes I make more bacon then the recipe calls for. It does take some time to make, but its worth it! We love this tasty cool summer salad.

I made this a day ahead. I used Hellman's mayonnaise with a little horseradish and Dijon.  We were surprised how good it was without onions,  but next time will add a little onion. Love the bacon and eggs.

I'm really not sure how to rate this recipe b/c something seems off w/ either the amount of potatoes or the amount of the other ingredients listed...First I wanna say that this is really good potato salad! I don't ever use Miracle whip for anything, but hubby likes it, so I thought I'd give it a try. I used 1 bag of baby red potatoes, so there wasn't that much there, so I'm thinking maybe the submitter means to use a 5# bag of potatoes??? Because I had less potatoes, I just eyeballed the ingredients to our liking...I used 4 hard boiled eggs, chopped, 12oz. cooked, crumbled bacon, about 1-1-1/2 cups Miracle Whip and about 1 cup of cheese. This was perfect for us. There just seemed to be too much, bacon, eggs and Miracle Whip for the amount of potatoes called for, so as written (b/c the amount of potatoes is not clear), I would probably give this less stars. We enjoyed this and I honestly didn't think it was gonna be that good, and was tempted to add some onion, but I'm glad I didn't b/c it was yummy and didn't need anyything else. I would make this again! Sorry if I sound confusing, but I don't know how else to say it, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)
