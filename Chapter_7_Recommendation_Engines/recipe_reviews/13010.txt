This is my favorite chili recipe not only because its incredibly delicious, but because its one of the healthiest entrees you can make.

I followed others' suggestions and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, 2 diced jalapenos (some said this was a little too hot, but I thought it just about right), canned corn instead of fresh, and salsa verde instead of canned tomatillos. One thing to remember is that the quality of the Salsa Verde (or tomatillos) is very important as it is perhaps the predominant flavor. Make sure to use a good quality salsa--that is, one you really enjoy on its own. I prefer Target's "Archer Farms Salsa Verde", which is about $3 for 24oz.

This was great!  After reading most of the comments, I substituted a bottle of salsa verde for the tomatillos, used two cans of diced tomatoes with chilis instead of the plain tomatoes, used a fresh jalapeno instead of the canned chilis, added a little extra broth and added 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch.  I put it all in the crock pot and let it cook for about 8 hours on low.  Garnished the bowls with sour cream and cheddar cheese.  It was fabulous!

Another Cook off winner to add to this recipe.

I doctored it a bit too:  I used the jar of Salsa verde, extra green chili's, fire roasted diced tomatoes, LOTS of cumin, and some chili powder as well. I heated the spices in the oil before adding both cubed and ground chicken. I used the ground chicken for texture - more traditional chili style, and added a touch a cream.  MMmmmm.

Thanks to other reviews, I was ready with the corn starch to thicken it up so it wasn't as soupy. 

I would like to say I loved it - but, by time I made my way back to the table to have some, it was GONE.  I don't think it lasted 15 minutes!!  

I WILL cook this again,  I would like to have more than just a sample spoon full...

I would give this 6 stars if I could!  A few minor changes include canned corn,  2 cans of beans, salsa verde instead of tomatillos, and some thickening with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1/2 c milk, all were suggestions from other reviews.  I also simmered it for an hour.  It is a nice change from the slow cooker taco soup that is also wonderful!

I am adding this last sentence after reading a more recent review by someone else who added lime to the chili and felt that it made it bitter....if you read the recipe again you will see that they suggest lime slices as a garnish:)

I've been making this chili for 2-3 years and EVERYONE who eats it asks for the recipe. I add more beans and chicken to make it thicker and heartier and serve bowls of the chili with grated cheese, onions,  tomatoes and sour cream as toppings but without all the sour cream, it even meets weight watchers criteria. I've had trouble finding tomatillos  so I have substituted using green enchilada sauce or green salsa. Still SCRUMPTIOUS!   My husband has prepared this chili for camping trips. It's still perfect after having been frozen!  Try it.  You won't be sorry.

Mui Bien!  Of course I had to do it "my way". 1. Used 2 nice large hand trimmed chicken breasts. 2. Patted them down with Emeril's Southwestern Essence and lightly seared with onions and some bell pepper. 3. Poured in the chicken stock, two cans of Rotel Tomatoes w/ Lime & Cilantro and a large jar of La Victoria Salsa Verde and added the spices (plus a bay leaf). 4. Simmered the breast 40 minutes then pulled out and shredded.  5. Returned to pot and added beans & a large can of sweet corn.  6. Cooked the chili down several hours and added a couple of cubes of chicken broth and vegetable broth along the way with some water and cornstarch.  This is a GREAT, healthy chili with an interesting flavor which we all enjoyed and I will make again.  This is NOT a recipe I will share as good chili recipes are "sacred".  Ha!

I was making this recipe for a friend who just had surgery. After I filled the container that I was taking her, there was enough for my husband and I to each have a bowl. My husband tasted it, looked up and said this is a keeper! I never thought I would be a fan of chicken chili, but this is fantastic. Because we’re giving it away, I didn’t add any of the suggested toppings, I just didn’t have any in the house, but it was wonderful without any! I couldn't find tomatillos, so I added diced tomatoes it their place. That was the only thing I changed. This is going to be a new staple in our household, and the fact that it's healthy is a real plus!

This was simple and very good.  I made it for house guests.  We had 5 adults and we ate it all up even though the recipe says it serves 9.  We did have seconds though.  I substituted Salsa Verde for the tomatillos, used 1 & 1/2 lbs chicken meat, and doubled the white beans because otherwise it would have seemed a bit soupy and less chunky. This had a nice spicy bite to it but was not too much.  I didn't need to add any salt at all because it was just perfect.  I am now going to add this recipe to my regular rotation.

I could not find canned tomatillos, so I used a jar of salsa verde instead, as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, I did not have any chicken already cooked, so I used cubed raw chicken and allowed the chicken, broth, tomato, green chiles, & spices mixture to simmer until the chicken was tender.  This made a nice hearty chili - not much broth.  Since I prefer it thinner, I added another can of broth and doubled the spices at the end, but the taste was great before I made those alterations.  Loved the chili. I will note that I was unsure of the addition of the salsa verde, so I waited until the recipe called for the addition of the corn/beans until I added it.  Tasted before and after and I really think the salsa made this recipe.  The flavor was excellent prior to the addition, but had no "kick." Might only rate 4 stars as written since I think the canned tomatillos are probably not as flavorful as the salsa verde, but since my grocery doesn't carry them...
Thanks for the recipe!

Really good for a fall night. Like others I kind of made it my own...cooked 4 really big chicken breasts in broth in the crockpot... shredded then added 1 jar of tomatillo salsa(Targets is the best). 3 cans white beans, one can corn. One bag southwest blend rice(has corn, peppers and onions in it). Added some chipotle seasoning and kicken chicken..let simmer for a few hour. Sour cream and cheese to top it off! Easy and so so good!!

Even using a more spirited and complexly flavored salsa verde rather than basic canned tomatillos didn’t elevate this higher than “just ok.”  It pretty much tasted simply like chicken, tomatoes and cumin. Didn’t have the full-bodied depth of flavor I expected.  Surprisingly, however, Hubs, who made it clear after I made it that he is no fan of white chicken chili, liked it better than he thought he would.  This was improved with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro upon serving. Oh…and by the way, its initial downfall in my view is that it is seriously lacking in eye appeal, once again, much inproved with garnish. Following day update: Hubs and I had this for lunch today and we agree it was much better!  An overnight stint in the fridge obviously gave all the flavors a chance to get to know each other and blend happily!  Also, stirring enough sour cream in to make it all nice and creamy really makes it better too.  There was such a difference between last night and today that I am compelled to raise my rating from three to four stars.  Final note: for best flavor, prepare in advance.

Wow, this chili turned out better than I thought it would!  I did alter slightly - as recommended by others, I used a jar of Salsa Verde in place of the tomatillos and added an extra can of beans (I used Navy beans and drained and rinsed them before use).  I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles in addition to the chopped green chiles.  I added chopped jalapenos and chili powder to give it a little more of a kick.  I also used a bag of frozen corn.  I did not have the issue of the chili being too liquidy, but I think that's because I drained the tomatoes and beans.  I think what makes this recipe is the toppings - fresh squeezed lime juice is a must!  My husband and I also topped with sour cream and shredded cheese.  I can't wait to try later today now that's it had time to sit overnight!

Wow, was this ever good, I to would give it more than 5 stars if I could. My husband, sons and brother raved and came back for more and then wanted it for lunch the next day. They made sure I promised to put this on the keeper list. Salsa verde was used instead of tomatillos, twice as many great northern beans than called for, a large bag of frozen corn, I had no coriander so I substitued Mrs. Dash Southwestern seasoning in place of the coriander. I also boiled the chicken with enough water to cover seasoned with celery salt, garlic powder, and pepper and used the broth from this for the chicken broth.
No thickener was needed since I used more chicken, beans and corn than called for. The celery salt added alot also that was used to boil the chicken in. I folded flour tortillas in half, filled with cheese, and nuked 30 seconds each then cut in half with pizza cutter. This was a perfect compliment for this wonderful chili.

Just a suggestion: rather than thickening with cornstarch I add a can of white beans after the initial boil and use an immersion blender, then add the corn, chicken and another can of beans. The soup is creamy and no cornstarch necessary! My immersion blender has been an indispensable addition to my kitchen. Great for making soups creamy using only vegetables.

This was pretty true to everyone else's reviews I'm happy to say!  I left out the oil, threw the chicken in with the sauces and spices raw and just let it all simmer together for about 40 minutes, pulled the chicken out, shredded it, put it back in for another 20 minutes (absorbed the flavors quite nicely) then  and added the beans and some frozen sweet corn.  I liked the sweet corn because it gave it a huge complimentary burst of sweet when you bit into a kernel.  I also used salsa verde instead of straight tomatillos, and I would do that again, gives it just enough "kick".  I added some cilantro, but I don't think I'd do it again.  Not that it was bad, but I think it just overwhelmed all of the other flavors which were perfect on their own.  Great easy and super HEALTHY recipe!  10 stars just for the latter!

I thought this was okay.  It seemed more like spicy vegetable soup instead of chili.  Not bad, but didn't have that thick "chili" feel to is.  It was good and healthy, but if you are looking for Chili, this isn't it.***Update:  Made this tonight, I'm giving it 5 stars, even though I tweaked it to fit what I had on hand:  I used 1 can of sweet corn.  one can of diced tomatoes with chopolte peppers, and 32 oz of chicken broth.  I took the olive oil, onion, and garlic, and simmered until the onion was soft.  Then I added green salsa, diced green chilis, 32 oz box of chicken broth, 1.4 lbs of chicken breast tenders.  Simmered for about 5 hours.  Then I added the beans, and the corn.  I skipped the jalapeno 50% of my family called it a favorite.  One called it "meh", and one called it good but hot.  I call it my favorite chili recipe.

This is TO DIE for! I love it! I used a can of corn rinsed. I only used 10oz chicken broth, 2 cans of beans,  and 1 tsp corn starch and it is just perfect! I didn't use any tomotillas but used 1/2 cup salsa and some extra tomatos instead. Thanks so much!

Simple, delicious, and healthy!  I boiled some chicken thighs and saved the water to make my chicken broth.  I just added some instant chicken boillon for a richer broth.  I also added a small yellow and small green pepper to the mix of vegetables.  I like lots of beans in my soups and chilis, so I also added a can of pinto beans along with the white beans.  I followed the advice of others and used salsa (about 3/4 jar) instead of the tomatillos.  I used a freshly diced jalepeno instead of canned peppers.
Also used frozen corn instead of fresh, ommitted the corriander (didn't have it on hand), and used thyme instead of oregano (by mistake).  I used five cloves of garlic and lots of extra cumin and added some cornstarch to thicken up the chili a bit.  If you use lots of veggies like I did, make sure you use less liquid and add a thickener (cornstarch, flour, tomato paste, etc.).  The water is going to cook out of the veggies and thin out your final result.

This is great! I made some changes to make it a five star dinner. This is on constant rotation in our house, probably once a month! My changes were: I drained and rinsed TWO cans of beans. If you can find tomatillos (I know it's hard) use them, it makes a HUGE difference. I keep a stock of them in my pantry so I always have them on hand. I also add a lot of cilantro. I also add some jalapenos to make it spicy. I can't say enough about this!

Chili was great! 

THICKENING TRICK - skip the corn starch and purée an additional can of beans in your mini chop or food processor and add to the pot.  This gives it more of a restaurant feel like its been cooking all day.

Also, I added a sprinkling of shredded sharp cheddar, dollop of sour cream and cilantro in each bowl before serving.

This was great! I actually just threw everything in my crock pot just to see how it went, and it was the best chili recipe I've found in a long while (and I've tried tons and tons).  Next time, I likely will add a second can of beans and maybe some salsa verde. Also, I probably will drain some of the ingredients because it was awfully watery, but still tasted great.  In case anyone wants to try it in the crock pot, I just mixed all the ingredients together in the crock pot, laid the chicken breasts on top and cooked on low for about 9 hours. Then, I just shredded the chicken with two forks and served with sour cream.

I do think this is "the best" but made a few changes. 

I used 3 T minced garlic, I used the meat and juices of a cooked whole chicken. I chopped 2 tomatillas, instead of canned and cooked with the onion and garlic. I used one package of frozen sweet corn instead of corn on the cob, and added a can of black beans. Instead of the diced green peppers, I added a 7 ounce can of salsa verde. 

I also deleted the salt and pepper, because everyone has different tastes for these. Then, I added one whole jalapeno pepper, floating at the top for looks, and to satisfy my personal heat tastes!

I also added everything to a slow cooker, after cooking the veggies, and let it cook on low for 8 hours. It was a huge hit to everyone. This is a keeper!

Excelente!  This was LOVED by all and all want the recipe.  I made a couple changes - I shredded a rotisserie chicken from the market and used all of the meat, substituted a tablespoon or so of dried cilantro instead of the oregano, used four ears of corn, used 3 cans of beans and pureed two first, used 3 cups of broth, and added 1/4 cup of Mrs. Renfro's green salsa for heat (add to taste).  This served about 15.  What a hit and easy too, going to make this lots.

My husband loved this.  He said it was the best thing he had eaten in a long time!  I used a Rotisserie chicken, 2 cans of niblet corn and 2 cans of white beans.  I also substituted the tomatillos for Roasted Salsa Verde (which was wonderful).  I also left off the coriander seed.  I didn't have any on hand and didn't recall ever having a recipe call for it so I couldn't justify spending $13 for it.  This really was yummy.  I simmered on the stovetop for about an hour.  We are looking forward to having it again tonight.  (OH...hubby ate his plain and I added avacado and sour cream.)

Great chili! The first time I didn't use any green tomatoes, just diced red and it tasted awesome. Second time I used salsa verde and no red tomatoes, and it tasted awesome.  Both times it was a little watery so I added a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up.

Wow, this recipe was very good! I had 3 bowls of it for dinner and taking some for lunch tomorrow! I skipped the tomatillos, added 2 cans of tomatoes with mild chiles and used leftover turkey in place of the chicken.  Made cheesy corny bread to go along with it. Will definately make again and again.

Hi Thea.  Just wanted to let you know that I found your recipe about 5 years ago, printed it out on a card, and have loved it ever since.  My recipe book is currently in storage, and I really felt like making this white bean chicken chili this weekend.  I just googled "white bean chicken chili" on a lark, and the link to your recipe was the first result.  I love it when life is that easy.  Anyway, thanks so much for this recipe.

This was really great - I roasted fresh corn and fresh green chilis on the grill to add some more flavor and my family gave it two thumbs up! (And were really impressed after dinner when I told them how healthy it was for them - healthy CAN be delicious!) Thanks for posting!!!

Instead of tomatillos - I used a jar of La Victoria Green Salsa and 2 cans of white beans.  I threw it in the crockpot and it was perfect.  Both boys (11 & 13 loved it).

This was great and the whole family loved it. I did substitute a jar of salsa verde and added the cornstarch/milk mixture as others had suggested. A few other minor tweaks: I cooked the onion and garlic in the oil, then added the spices (I used cumin and chili powder) and cooked for 1 minute. Then I added the broth, canned tomatoes and green chiles and  brought it to a boil.  Next I added cubed raw boneless skinless chicken breast, covered and let simmer for 10 minutes. Finally I added a bag of frozen corn, the salsa verde, two cans of beans and the cornstarch and let the whole thing simmer for another 30 minutes. Yummy!

White Bean Chicken Chili Haiku: "Fresh tomatillos. Skipped tomatoes to stay 'white.' It's tame, but tasteful." In staying w/ the white chili theme, I didn't use canned diced tomatoes, and instead doubled up on fresh tomatillos. I'm surprised at how many reviewers replaced tomatillos w/ salsa verde b/c that really would change the recipe substantially as commercial salsa would feature a variety of seasonings. Other than the tomatillos and an additional can of cannelini beans (good for thickening it up), I stuck to the recipe. Threw everything in the slow-cooker b4 leaving for work this morning and came home to an enticing aroma. Yes, it's a very mild chili, but after adding grated cheese, cilantro, and green onions, and scooping it up w/ tortilla chips, my belly was transported to chili Eden.

I loved this recipe! I used Salsa Verde in place of the tomatillos. The quality of the salsa verde you buy definitely makes a difference in the flavor since I used 2 different kinds the 2 times I made this.This was delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

I will never understand why people rate a recipe when they completely changed it around. The way the recipe is, without any changes, is very bland and soupy. With MANY changes, which would completely  make a new recipe, it is very good.

Absolutely phenomenal...

tweaked a little bit...added cream of celery and cream of chicken to thicken the chili but other than that a little extra cumin and garlic...

MY picky stubborn baby girl willfully gobbled it up and my wife and I agree this is without a doubt the best white (or red) chili we've ever had.

I thought this was a great reference to work off of for making White Chicken Chili for the first time. I made a few minor adjustments since then; I mixed in about 1/2 cup of Mexican shredded cheese. I also thickened the chili with some flour and almost doubled the spices the recipe called for. I also added some spicy Salsa Verde. A spoonful of sour cream, dash of Cilantro and some tortilla strips on top made it perfect! Everyone loved it!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  Perfect on a cold autumn day after a football game.  The house smelled wonderful as this simmered on the stove.  I doubled the recipe to have enough to freeze for lunches.  I substituted the following:  salsa verde, canned tomatoes with green chillies, canned sweet corn, and added half ground chicken and half cooked cut up chicken, to give it more of a chili texture.  After it simmered for about an hour, in a separate little bowl I put 3 tablespoons of corn starch (add less if you're not doubling the recipe like I did) and added a little cold water and stirred till dissolved.  I then slowly stirred the corn starch mixture into the chili to thicken, and simmered for another five minutes.  I served with a large dollop of lite sour cream on top!  We thought it had the right amount of kick!   DELISH!!

I used the same ingredients, but because I didn't have any of the canned ingredients for a change (shock of all shockers) I used fresh vegetables and dried beans.  Delish -- I roasted the tomatillos, with jalapeno, poblano pepper, onion, tomato, and red pepper in a 350 degree oven for about an hour. Did a course chop on them using the blender. I sauted skinless, bonelss chicken breasts with onions and garlic, that I had seasoned with salt, pepper, coriander, cumin, mexican oregano, and dried jalapeno. I added about a can of beer to simmer the chicken. I soaked my beans, added everything together -- extra canned chicken broth, then everthing in the oven - 325 degrees, till beans were soft!  I removed the chicken breasts, diced them, and and re-mixed them in  with the rest. While it seems like a lot of work, I did it over two days, in cracks of time. Sauce made and beans soaked first, then everything else the second day. YUM. I know, it's not even close to the original, but it is true to the inspiration -- thanks for the recipe.

Perfect & Delicious ! ! ! 

The only thing I suggest doing differently is cook the chicken in the oil first, then removing to shred. I also used 1 can of corn instead of fresh.

Big hit at our house!  Even our two year old loved it!  I threw everything into the crockpot without precooking anything and used canned corn in lieu of fresh.  My picky BF was skeptical - but I think he had three bowls!  Loved the ease of being able to cook it in the crock pot.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Another chili cook off winner with this recipe. I also substituted tomatillos with verde sauce. I like mine really spicey and added some jalapenos for heat, and added 1tsp of dried cilantro. Instead of cubing chicken breasts I bought a rotisserie cooked chicken and stripped all of the meat and used all of that.

I have made this for the past two falls.  Everyone who tries it tells me it is the best they ever had.  I could not find tomatillos so I used verde salsa instead.  This if a keeper for sure.

I absolutely loved this. My brother stopped over a few days after I made it and said it was the best chili he had ever had and was extremely impressed with my cooking abilities (or reading abilities). I didn't change a thing except that I couldn't find the tomatillos and used salsa verde like everyone else. And PS- stewed tomatoes are disgusting and are not the same thing as diced. Whoops.

This was quick and delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into 1/2" cubes and sauted them along with the onions and garlic.  I couldn't find canned tomatillas, so I substituted 8 oz of salsa verde (green tomatilla salsa).  I also substituted two 10 oz. cans of RO*TEL tomatoes for the canned tomatoes and chilis.  Excellent light supper for a cool Autumn evening!

Awesome! Good stuff! I did modify it a tiny bit. I used 1 1/2 lbs. diced chicken breast, a 16 oz jar of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos and a lot more of the spices that were listed. I also used canned corn, which I drained, and two cans of beans instead of one . LOVE the coriander! Gives it a nice flavor. The recipe doesn't say to drain the cans, but I did, which helped with the soupiness that some complained about. Thanks for the post!

This was a great recipe, didn't even seem "healthy" as it is so flavorful.  We loved it with avocados, a little sour cream and some cheese sprinkled on top.  My husband liked to scoop it up with tortilla chips.  Great leftovers, too.  If you're thinking about trying it, just go for it, you will be happy you did!

Really good!  All I had on hand was a can of crushed tomatos and some medium salsa.  I had a pack of 6 frozen chicken tenders, I fried them (using very little oil) chopped them in little pieces and added some left over white beans we had made a day or so before. Which was way more than the recipe called for, if I had to guess I would say it was more like 2 or 3 cans.  I used the exact spices.  It turned out great.  The corn added great texture, a nice crunch.  I made a creole type cornbread to serve with, and topped with fat free sour cream... YUMMMMMM.

My very picky three and six year olds ate this, even though it had beans in it.  That would almost be enough for me to rate this as a 5, but I too found it to be an tasty and filling cool-weather meal.  I have easy access to fresh tomatillos, so I substituted those for the canned, and I *always* add more garlic than a recipe calls for, but I otherwise went with the recipe as written.  Lots of leftovers.

It's so good we can't stop eating it! I have exchanged diced bell pepper for the corn and took out tomatillos (just don't have them in the pantry). It's easy to make and is now a family favorite.

Good base for white chili. Used ground turkey and browned w/onions & garlic before adding the rest. Used fresh tomatillos and simmered for a few extra minutes. Doubled the chilis for a little more kick. Drain the beans and the chili turns out less soupy. My family loved it.

This was really good!  Actually did it in the Crock Pot so it was more like soup than a thick chili!  Only added 1/2 of the can of white beans and left our the salsa verde and corn...only because I didn't have any and figured the can of chilies would provide enough kick!

Good, and satisfying. I used the salsa verda like some people said to. It came out a little to spicy for my wife, but a little cheese and sour cream fixed that.

When I had all these ingredients together in the crockpot, I thought the result looked gross (I'm used to standard red chili) and tasteless. Even though it wasn't hot yet, I took a taste. To my surprise, it was really quite yummy! Everyone at the potluck liked the chili, and there were hardly any leftovers. I bought a whole rotisserie chicken and pulled the chicken off (I added all the chicken, and this made the chili very hearty). I used 1 can of broth, 1 can of great northern beans, 1 can of corn, 2 cans of rotel (necessary), one large jar of the Archer Farms salsa verde that another reviewer recommended (fantastic addition, btw), 1 red pepper, 1 onion, and lots of garlic. I used the spices as stated from the recipe, but forgot the oregano. No need to add the extra chiles with all this, as you don't notice them with the salsa. I recommend offering sour cream, shredded cheese, and crispy tortilla strips to add on top of a bowl of this chili. Cook on high in the crock pot for at least 2 hours.

I absolutely love this recipe. I was looking for something lowfat and somewhat different to take to a chili get together with my friends. Each family was to bring chili. Mine won hands down! I did listen to some of the other reviews and changed some of the recipe to fit our family. I am actually fixing it right now on this snowy day in Ohio. Thanks!!

This recipe is great. Very low on fat and calories. Great for anyone on weight watchers.   I changed it by using 1 T of olive oil, 12.5 oz of canned chicken breast (from Costco), and I use frozen corn.

SPECTACULAR! So full of flavor! Taking other reviewers feedback into consideration, I added chili pepper (1 tsp), cornstarch (3 tsp), 1/2 cup milk, and Rotel mild tomatoes w/ chilis.   This is the BEST!

This is an outstanding recipe. Here are some of the wrinkles or twists I threw into the recipe:
* Used everything fresh: tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapino peppers for spice instead of green chilis, dry beans (pinto).

* Added twice the amount of beans

* Used half herb-roasted chicken and half diced chicken breast.

* Added extra chicken stock and a little water from boiling beans down to provide a bit more fluid to the mix.

* Diced up cilantro and added to mix near end of cooking time, maybe a couple tablespoons.

* Added four pieces of corn on the cobb and boy were they delicious!

I will make this tasty, healthy dish time and again!

Wow. Don't even hesitate to double or triple this recipe.  It's awesome, and will be on my short list of quick, great dishes to make.  It's got a great combination of flavors and spices.  I'd add a little more spice than the recipe calls for. . .Overall. . .  I was really impressed!

Wonderful!  I had no tomitillos or salsa verde, so just skipped them.  I diced some jalepenos and simmered a bit longer than the recipe called for.  LOVED it!  Topped with a little grated cheese and tortilla chips.  The onions, garlic and tomatoes are a MUST!

Awesome!  This recipe is fantastic.  I substituted an extra can of diced tomatoes for the tomallitos.  Added a scoop of sourcream, cheedar cheese and some tortilla chips to to each bowl for garnish.  It was super!  I saved the left overs for lunch the next two days

I prepared this recipe with no additions or changes and it was very good.  The next time I make it, I will probably make it a little more spicy and add another can of beans.

My husband and child gave this 4 stars. My son had 3 bowls. It was very tasty but too runny. I pureed one can of beans but still to runny. It was more like a soup. It also was not spicy enough for us. I will make this again though. Thanks for sharing.

I used Green salsa verde instead of the chiles and tomatillos and added a can of black beans. Great!

This recipe is to die for! I've made this dish twice and both times it's been a hit. I usually get a package of frozen corn steamers and use that instead of fresh corn as I make this in the winter and fresh corn isn't really available. Also, I up the amount of chicken so the chili is a bit higher in protein. One hint: tomatillos are sometimes found in the Mexican/Latino section of the grocery store. I've used the brand "La Costena" and "Embasa" and both brands have worked well in this dish. If you can't find whole tomatillos, then search for salsa verde. However, I would make sure that the ingredients in the salsa verde is mostly tomatillos (some brands add a lot of other stuff to their salsa verde). Lastly, we think Tostitos Hint of Lime chips pairs well with this dish along with sour cream, cheddar cheese, cilantro, avocado, and fresh lime juice. Enjoy!

Not sure I can even rate this because I changed it quite a bit.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken, Herdez salsa verde instead of tomatillos and I added another 12 ozs of chicken broth and an additional can of beans. I did add some corn starch to thicken it.  Everything else was by the recipe except I cooked it on high for 3 hours in the crock pot. Turned out great and I would definitely make it again,

One of our favorites, we eat it all the time in the fall and winter. To make it easier, I throw everything (except the corn and beans) into the crock pot. I use a jar of a chunky salsa verde. When I get home (about an hour before we eat) I add a can of white beans and corn (sometimes canned, sometimes I will grill a couple ears and then add) and will add more spices if needed. 
Love how easy it is, and that it is a healthy comfort meal that can be made in the crock pot. I top mine with some cheddar jack cheese, avocado, and a dollop of plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

This was fantastic.  I made a few alterations based on other reviewers suggestions and our personal tastes.  I used salsa verde instead of tomatillos, used tomatoes with diced green chiles, added extra cumin and about 1 tbsp chili powder, used steamed frozen corn, added a finely diced jalapeno and a finely diced cherry pepper (we like things spicy!) and an additional can of beans.  Next time I will use black beans instead of another can of white beans for more color.  I've had to give this recipe to everyone for whom I have served it.  Fantastic!

Only good with sweet cornbread.  Salsa verde was disgusting.  I tasted it before I added it, and decided to add 1 more can of diced tomatoes instead of the salsa verde.  I was going to add salsa verde because alot of the others raters did that instead of the tomatillas, which is hard to find.  I would not make it again.

I made the recipe as read except i doubled the beans and used canned unsalted corn. I also shredded the cooked chicken instead of cubed for personal preference. The preparation was fairly quick compared to other chili recipes. The dish is tasty, especially with shredded cheese on top. Will make again.

I needed something I could throw in the Crockpot and this recipe sounded so good I wanted to try it. I used the suggestions of LovestocookinMN. I diced up raw chicken breasts, used salsa verde, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and frozen corn. Threw it all in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on high and it turned out fantastic! The chicken wasn't dry, I think because I only cooked it for 5 hours. Honestly, I didn't expect it to turn out this good, but it was gone after everyone had one bowl then they had to have two.

Honestly, I just used the spicing suggested here, and put what I wanted in the chili.  It turned out really well, and I'll have to remember this spice combination; not too hot, very flavorful.

A great healthy dinner!  I did as other reviewers suggested and used salsa verde.  I only used jalapeno juice and 2 minced peppers instead of the can for my little one.  I added more cumin and a pinch of smoked paprika that I had on hand.  Since the sauce was very thin i pureed an extra can of beans (minus the liquid) and added it as a thickener.  Good fall dinner.  Thank you!

I have made this with and without the tomatillos, and with and without chicken (increase the beans), and it is still wonderful. I cut the oregano in half (mine is strong), and used only 1/8 tsp. coriander. Excellent. Oh, I had to halve the chiles for the littles :(.

Very tasty!  To make this low-sodium, I used fresh tomatillos and and tomatoes instead of canned, substituted dried beans (cooked and drained) for canned, and left out salt.  Perhaps because of the fresh veggies, this dish had a little too much liquid, so I will reduce the broth next time.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Although I like all the ingredients used in this recipe and commonly cook with them all,  there was just something off about this recipe.  It just had to many flavors going on and seemed to clash.  The smell from when it was cooking was even unpleasant.  I had high expectations for this dish and  it just didn't do it for us.  Perhaps in the future I may try something similar again with some changes.

WOW. I made this for a quick family dinner the other night and served with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and corn chips since I didn't have any corn meal for cornbread. Everyone LOVED it and enjoyed the spicy kick it gave. I'm glad I doubled the recipe because we had lunch for a whole week and I was even able to freeze some for a quick dinner next month. Thank you VERY much for sharing!

I've made this recipe twice now, and I agree that my family would prefer it over regular chili. I finely chopped the tomatillos in my food processor which gave it a salsa verde type look, but was cheaper. I increased the amount of spice just a bit and added a jalapeno, garlic, and finished with cilantro. I also used an extra can of white beans and then finished with adding some cream or half and half. Topped each bowl with crushed tortilla chips. Will be a "go to" soup recipe for years to come!

Very similar to a weight watcher's recipe I made for girls game night.  The recipes are very interchangeable, but followed the Dove's nest one from WW which you add 2 tbsp lime juice and use cannelli white beans and a medium jalepeno are the differences.  I cooked up my chicken with broth and garlic, set aside and started on the onions, jalepeno, garlic ect on stove, added everything to the crock pot for the party to finish it off. I too used salsa verde as suggested here, everyone loved this and it was gone in a flash had to email the recipe to them this morning.

Awesome! I also agree on adding 3 tbs of cornstarch, probably 2 more cans of beans (I had added some red beans and the added more texture and because I did not have more white beans), and a couple of jalapenos to make it a little spicier. I am definitely keeping this recipe though!

Yum!  Following other reviewers - I used a jar of Herdez Green Salsa (no canned tomatillos at my market).  Also added 2 cans of tomatoes with chilis, and 2 cans of white beans.  Adding broth as needed.  Added 1 diced japanenos - mine were very hot, so stuck to one.  I am loving it and am on my second bowl.

Tastes great! I had to tweak the recipe as I could not find tomatillos or salsa verde at my local market.  I also added a can of mixed ready to eat beans.  I used frozen sweet corn.  And I added a small can of fire roasted tomatoes. I cut up a large green pepper and I used half a jar of diced jalapenos instead of green chiles.  Thanks!

Awesome flavour!!!  This is soooo yummy.  The only thing I wish I had done was add the chilies at the end to my taste because the amount recommended in this recipe is way too spicy for me.  But this chicken chili is the best I've had!!

I cheated a couple of things but got the gist of it I think.  I've never bought tomatillos and used just regular tomatoes, as it seems many people did.  I also did my usual of not using pieces of onion, but use onion powder, onion juice or pulverize them.  (And don't usually remember which.)  And I pulverized the tomato as well.  (I don't like pieces of stuff like that.)  My Good Cooks Handbook says an ear of corn is ~ 1/2 cup so used 1 cup frozen corn.  And when I see "white" beans I think of cannellini which is what I also see for most white chilis.  Used all the spices and such as is.  Used a fair amount of pepper & just a little salt.  I then put some sour cream, cheddar cheese and tortilla chips on top.  Can't say as the chips did anything for it.  This was very good - not a super hot spicy but flavorful and good.  Unfortunately I'd bought a new brand of sour cream that wasn't that great, and I think this could be more fabulous with a good sour cream.  I do agree with the reviewer that said it's more of a tortilla soup than white chili.  As for the recipe, WHY can't ingredients be put in order of use - that's just confusing.  And why ears of corn?  With all that other junk in there I can't see noticing whether it's fresh or frozen but that's just me.

This is a great recipe that my whole family enjoys. Even my picky 15 year old son! Like some of the other reviewers, I could not find tomatillos easily, but found that Salsa Verde worked very well also. I also used Mexican style diced tomatoes, that come with Jalapenos in them. Just the right amount of spice. Of course the corn helps tone that down. I also used frozen corn instead of fresh, as that is hard to come by in the cold Midwestern fall and winters. Luckily our corn was frozen from our garden, yummy.  Overall a great recipe, with mostly common ingredients, thereby only a few substitutions were needed.

Oh sweet heavenly chicken chili. This was DELICIOUS!! I love the fact that you don't need to make it in the crock pot. The only things I did different from the recipe was I used Salsa Verde (Like all reviews suggest) That really made it taste awesome. I did two cans of beans to make it a bit more hearty (Doing that I don't think you would need to make it thicker with cornstarch.) And I also did a can of corn. The best part is that it all cost under $20.00! And I used organic onions and peppers. I suggest to eat with tortilla chips, Garnish with lime and cilantro.

I would give this a million stars if I could. I few changes I made: I added a diced poblano chili with the onions and garlic. It added a nice dimension of flavor without being too spicy. I used one can of crushed tomatillos, a can of diced tomato with jalapeno, and one can of regular diced tomatoes.  It was over the top delicious!!

This was great!  I sauteed the onions w/ the spices, doubled the cumin, added chili powder & heavy cream and followed other suggestions by using Salsa Verde as I couldn't find tomatillos.  I used Stewed Tomatoes I pureed and added ground chicken to the mixture & let it cook all together.  i had to use 4 T corn starch to thicken it.    I used 1-3/4 lb of ground chicken.  Next time I will use 2-1/2 lb. We put shredded cheese on top. My family devoured it!

Thank you for this recipe!

My husband and I almost always use the left-over meat from a roast chicken to make this.... it's worth roasting a chicken just to enjoy this chili! :-)

We've made this chili following the exact recipe, as well as using additional diced tomatoes as a substitute for the hard to find tomitillos. It's delicious either way.

A wonderful, satifying chili... especially on cold days.

This was just okay, missing something that I can't put my finger on. I added more spice after eating a bowl and deciding it needed more, that did help the flavor a good deal.

This is one of the most requested dishes I have made.  I usually make a double batch  Very tangy and light.  Its a great alternative to thick traditional chili.

This is a favorite with my family now!!  We do not have canned tomatillos at our store so I use between 10 to 15 fresh tomatillos and half a bottle of green salsa.  I also think this recipe needs one more can of white beans and some tabasco.  Absolutely delicious!!

I made this last night  and it was great. I made a couple of changes such as using ground turkey, 1 more can of beans and mixed 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 with 2tsp cornstarch to thicken it a bit. It had great flavor and my husband loved it.

This is the most flavorful recipe.  I doubled it and the whole pot was consumed by 8 people with nothing left over!!!
I did use about 3 tablespoons of CORNMEAL to thiken it and it thickened beautifully.
I only used half the recommended chicken broth. Love this recipe.

This was a very healthy and impressive chile served on white rice. 

Changes - I boiled and shredded 3 chicken breasts instead of diced, my can of red tomatoes had added jalapenos, 2 cans of white beans instead of 1, and I added a small can of La Casera salsa verde, fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime. 

To ensure thickness, I drained & rinsed everything canned. Also - I dissolved 2-3 TBSP. corn starch in a bit of agua and added to the first set of ingredients to thicken.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have tomatillos, corriander, or cumin, so I ommited them., and since I used diced tomatoes with jalepenos already added, I omitted the can of green chiles.  I also simmered it for about 1 hour to allow the flavors to mix well.  Served with shredded cheddar  cheese and sour cream, this made an excellent, filling meal.

FANTABULOUS!!  This is has been a regular on our menu for a couples year now.  I double the recipe and freeze half of it it's so wonderful.  

I have made a couple changes, though.  Instead of cooked cubed chicken, I make a paste of brown sugar, chili powder & olive oil.  then I coat the chicken, grill it and shred it.  (I think the shredding adds a wonderful texture to the meal.)  Then, instead of tomatillos & jalepenos, I just use salsa verde to save a step! 

YUM!!  Thanks Thea!

Great recipe! Since I'm new at cooking, I didn't use the tomatillos or coriander seed because I didn't know what they were; it turned out fine! (I have since looked both ingredients up and am prepared for my next meal that calls for these!)
I also used 1 can of corn kernels instead of fresh ears of corn, 1 can of Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes and then the diced green chilies, and used 1 can of the white chili beans instead of plain white beans. It was fabulous! I have shared this recipe with many of my co-workers, plus my fiancé absolutely loved it! :)

We've made this several times now, and we love it.  Not only is it delicious, but it's a quick meal to prepare after work.  I always just buy a deli chicken from the grocery store.  Other than that, we made the recipe as written.  Thanks for posting!

I took this to a Super Bowl party and everyone liked it. I used all the ingredients except the coriander. The only changes I made were in the way I put it together. I live in Florida, so fresh Tomatillos are always available. I roasted the tomatillos, FRESH jalapenos, and poblano peppers and garlic under the broiler for a few minutes. I peeled and seeded all the peppers but one, you never can tell how how those seeds are, can always add more later. Threw those items in the blender and chopped them up. I sauteed the onions and then added the blended mixture in and coked that up and then added the tomatoes and all the seasoning. After that cooked for a few minutes, I added the chicken broth, but I added about 4 cups or so. Then I cooked that covered for an hour. I feel like the flavors needed to meld together.  The next morning I threw it in a crockpot and added the beans, cooked chicken and fresh corn off the cob, brought it up to heat and served. Was nice and thick, had a great kick to it, but not over the top. Try it!

I love this recipe and have made it a ton.  I double (at least) the cumin and also add chili powder.  I use the cilantro green olive salsa (with tomatillos) from Salpica.  It's expensive, but worth it.  Add avocados, sour cream, crushed tortillas, cheddar cheese, black olives, serve with rice, etc...  I double/triple it for parties and everyone always wants the recipe.  It's a terrific find so thank you!

This was great. I let it simmer for a bit longer than suggested for a more concentrated flavor and texture.

I rarely write a review, but I rarely try a new recipe this good.  I did the same as many others and used Salsa Verde rather than tomatillos.  I also started 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot with a can of tomatoes, a small can of diced chiles, and a cup of chicken broth then transferred them to the dutch oven I sauteed the onion and garlic in to finish the soup.  I used canned corn.  I put sour cream, diced avocado, shredded cheese, tortilla strips, and cilantro on the table for people to add if they wanted and served with quesadillas.  My family of 4 ate the whole pot and all said the recipe was a keeper!

I made this recipe almost exactly to instructions. I did add the 2T. cornstarch that others suggested. I mixed 2T. of cornstarch with a little of the chicken broth to make a slurry. I warmed the chili and right before boiling added the cornstarch slurry. I also used grilled chicken right from my grocery store that I chopped up to save time. I was concerned about whether to drain and rinse the canned beans as normally I do, but the recipe did not call for it. I eventually decided to drain them but not rinse. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and my husband and I loved it! I can't wait to make this for a football party in the fall.

I followed the recipe exactly except for:
-I used fresh tomatillos instead of canned
-2 cans of white beans instead of one (one can butter beans, one can northern beans)
-I used meat from a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store
-garnished with "scoop" tortilla chips, sour cream, and limes

It was amazing!  I will definitely make this again.

This take on chili is a nice break from the usual beef-and-beans mix. The tomatoes and tomatillos give it a good flavor that mixes nicely with the beans and corn, and you can toss all the ingredients in the crockpot if you don't want to make it on the stove after work. It goes very nicely with a warm loaf of homemade bread, too.

SOOOOOO delicious!!!  Like others, I used a can of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos.  I also used a can of fire roasted red peppers and a can of rotel.  I added a good helping of chili powder as well as a squeeze of fresh lime.  Let is simmer on the stove and served with sour cream.  Amazing!!

I made a double recipe using two cans of white corn and four fresh tomatillos. I have never tried a chicken chili before and it was delish.  My husband and son love it..so it is a keeper! Plenty of leftovers for our busy week.

I didn't use the tomatillos or green chiles and I added just one can of diced tomatoes. It came out fantastic! I also used canned corn.

This was pretty good but I'm not sure I'd call it chili. Added another can of beans and used homemade tomatillo salsa. Also used homemade chicken stock. Hard to go wrong with any soup recipe when you use your own stock. Might make again. My husband liked it.

This is very tasty. I made it once with salsa verde and once with fresh tomatillos. I used about 2lbs of tomatillos and broiled them about 10 mins then put them in the blender . Using fresh tomatillos was by far the better method if you have the time.    I like things hot so I also added 1 fresh jalapeno. It was too soupy both times so next time I will add less chicken broth. I also used frozen corn and  rinsed the white beans before adding.

I love this recipe and am now making it once a week!  However, I find that it is too soupy for my taste as written so I omit the chicken broth.  I have used fire roasted salsa verde from Fresh and Easy or Trader Joe's and also use fresh Pico de Gallo and Rotel tomatoes with habernaros for extra flavor to make it a five star chili!!

Update:  We smoke turkey for Thanksgiving. We dice the leftover turkey to add to this chili.  We then put the turkey carcass and skin in a big pot, cover it with water, and boil over night.  The next morning, we have wonderful smoky turkey broth to use in this chili.  This makes this great recipe even better!  

---
Great for using up Thanksgiving turkey.  I subbed green tomatoes for the tomatillos since I don't have any (but better with them or salsa verde).  You can boil the turkey carcass for a few hours to make the broth, too.

Good stuff!  I used regular diced tomatoes and 2 cans of beans (white beans and garbanzos).  I also added some chili powder.  I forgot to buy the corn so I didn't use and it was still bomb diggity.  My b/f says to put it in the dinner rotation :)

Made this yesterday and couldn't wait to review!  AMAZING!! Better than Seasons 52 and healthy!!  I made a couple of changes: added a can of garbanzo beans, added 2 cans of Rotel chunky tomatoes and green chilis instead of tomatillos and tomatoes. also blended 1/4 the beans in my food processor with a little of the juice from soup to thicken it up.  LOVE IT!!!!!!

This was pretty good...   Very different than what I'm used to, but good.   I too used Salsa Verde in place of tomatillos, and I added a lot of extra spices - chili powder and red pepper flakes - frankly, it needed the flavor.   I had bought a cooked roasted chicken from the supermarket and cut it up - made it very easy.   For those of you watching your figure - Made the way I did, it calculates at 5 weight watcher PointsPlus per serving.

Wonderful meal for a chilly fall or winter evening.  I took other readers advice and used a jar of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos.  I added an addtional can of diced tomatoes and white beans to add more "girth" to the soup.  We liked it even better the days following as leftovers.  I served it with tortillas, cilantro, cheddar cheese, fresh lime juice, and a dollop of sour cream!  A definite keeper!

WOW is all I have to say about this chili. Made it with my boyfriend tonight and it was by far the best I've ever had. As some recommended... I use a jar of hot salsa verde. Also blended an extra can of white beans to make it thicker...and added a few tbs's of cornstarch to thicken it more. Slow cooker all day and it turned out amazingg. Gotta add the dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheese on top :)

Definitely needs some tweaking. I used tomatoes instead of tomatillos, and I put the chicken broth in a blender with an additional can of beans to thicken it so it was more of a chili than a soup. Definitely needs more spices as well. I added Adobe with cumin.

I made this exactly as is and our whole family absolutely loved it! And I love that the entire ingredient list can be made out of nonperishable items you can keep on hand for those times you have a bunch of chicken to use up.  I couldn't figure out why everyone kept saying salsa verde instead of tomatillos (easier to find?).  I found them and they are less expensive than the salsa so just in case I will be stocking up on tomatillos the next time I run across them in the store. The fresh corn was excellent, and I'll keep doing that unless I just don't have it on hand and want to make this one night.  I put this over white rice and froze half the batch for a go-to on my lazy don't-want-to-cook nights.  Putting SO many tomatoes, tomatillos, and chiles in the pot, I was dubious about it being unbalanced and watery, but it came together perfectly as everything cooked down- tasty, excellent consistency, and hearty and healthy!

I made this pretty much just like the recipe, except i put it all in a crock pot, and I also put in a white chicken chili spice mix. When i served it, I added a dollop of sour cream, which made it creamier and yummy.  The next time I make this i will use a double recipe, as it goes quick!!

Won church chili cook-off, 1st place out of 20!  Only differences (besides making it on larger scale): used white shoepeg corn (canned), kinda pricey but worth it.  Rotel: fireroasted, chili ready, & with the green pepper-things (this one adds a *bit* of heat)  Frozen bell pepper & sour cream mixed in.  And dehydrated onion, out of real ones.  Only spice added (besides onion & garlic) were packaged white chicken chili mix, found next to regular chili packet mixes.

pretty tasty. Used two cans of diced tomatoes and two cans of beans. Used canned salsa verde and 1 fresh jalapeno. next time i would leave out the coriander - nobody i served it to cared for the occasional bites of lime flavor.

This was delicious!!  I used fire roasted tomatoes, 2 small cans of salsa verde (couldn't find tomatillos).  I thought it needed some more beans so I used a can of pintos in addition to the northern.  Also used ground coriander and twice as much cumin and garlic...and a can of fiesta corn (green and red peppers in it)...we like really spicy food and I didn't need to use extra jalepeno like I normally do...next time I'll use a little more chicken but it's awesome!

Wonderful! I made a few changes... I added a bag of matchstick carrots at the garlic and onion stage and let them cook together. Also, I couldn't find canned tomatillos but the produce had fresh ones, so I bought 6... I have never used them before, but I washed and diced them. I beleive they add a little tart flavor to the chili which is nice! I also used a whole carton of reduced sodium chicken broth and 6 15oz cans of northern beans. Brought to a boil and then put on low for about 4 hours. It cooked down and the flavors emproved as it cooked. VERY YUMMY!

Real good.  I added some milk and used Fronterra tomatillo salsa and liked the flavor.  Also added habenero pepper diced very fine.

I loved this!! This freezes really well & since it made such a large amount we have been able to enjoy this for a long time.  I made a few changes though.  I added chopped fresh cilantro, canned mushrooms, several chopped tomatos, 1 tablespoon of corn starch, 2 jalepons diced, 1 can of corn(rather than fresh corn), & 1 18.75 ounce Wegmans Salsa Verde(rather than tomatillos)

I made a big batch and froze half. My husband devoured this! Today we ate the frozen half and it was delicious! Even better than the one we ate fresh!  What I love about this recipe: so easy to make and so healthy and so filling.  I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to tweek it per the previous reviwers. What I did: 1. cooked the chicken head of time in a mixture of chilli powder, brown sugar and chicken broth. 2. added 2 cans of white navy beans instead of 1. 3. added a can of corn instead of fresh corn and it was wonderful! 4. I don't even know what tomatillos are, so I added stewed tomatoes....and it was amazing! 5. added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and it was so thick and satisfying! Made it more stew-like and less soup-like. Excellent recipe!

yuuum!  I put my raw chicken in the slow cooker with onion, garlic and chicken broth and let it simmer for two hours.  Then I shredded the chicken and added the rest of my ingredients.  I used 2 cans of rotel instead of the salsa verde and served with cornbread.

It was a cold, damp snowy evening here in Denver and chicken chili sounded perfect for the weather. Like many other reviewers, I myself did a little "tweaking" as I usually do with recipes. I didn't have cooked chicken, so browned the cubed chicken in the Dutch oven with a little cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper then transferred to a bowl, to be added later. I then proceeded with the recipe adding the onions and garlic. I did replace the tomatillos with salsa verde and added an extra can of diced tomatoes. I added a bit more cumin than called for and a few dashes of Tabasco as we like a little more heat.  I omitted the coriander (as I was out and didn't realize it) as well as the corn. I let it simmer for about an hour and a half which thickened the chili nicely and intensified the flavors. I served with cheddar, sour cream, avocado, crushed tortilla chips, and a squeeze of lime juice. AMAZING! I would have to say this is my new favorite chicken chili recipe (and I have tried many!). This will be a new favorite in our home as well!

Great white bean chili recipe!! I am a vegetarian so I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and Quorn Chik'n Tenders instead of chicken. I also add several tablespoons of sugar which I think brings out the sweetness in the tomatos.

Both my boyfriend and I loved this recipe, which is a tough call.  I veered from the recipe a bit and cooked the diced chicken and 4 cloves of fresh garlic in a pan, then threw everything into a crockpot on high for 2 hours and low for another hour after that.  I did not use oil, tomatillos or lime and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilis.  I also added a can of pinto beans and a can of corn instead of fresh.  I served it with lowfat sour cream, shredded cheese and Tostitos chips and it was soooo yummy!  We fought over the last bowl of leftovers.

Excellent chili recipe!  I just won a chili cook-off at work with it!  I wasn't able to find canned tomatillos so, as others suggested, I substituted a can of salsa verde.  I also used one can of corn (without salt) in place of the ears of corn which aren't in season.

This was a great recipe, which I adjusted only slightly as follows: 4 T olive oil >4-5 large cloves of garlic (I love garlic b/c I don't do salt.) >2 lbs uncooked chix chopped into 1" squares--boneless chix breasts are easy >1 really large yellow onion chopped (I cried.) >10-15 chopped tomatillos (I panicked and lost count.) > >Heat olive oil and garlic cloves in a big soup pot, crush and mash garlic with fork as it softens (do not brown). Add chix and cook until no longer pink. Add onion and cook until transparent. Add chopped tomatillos and cook a few minutes until they are not so bright green. > >Okay, that was the only hard part! > >Add the following and simmer for another 30 minutes (or until you're sure the chix is cooked): > >2 cans (14.5) reduced sodium and fat chix broth >1 can (14 or 16) diced tomatoes >2 cans (4 oz) chopped mild diced green chiles >2 cans (15) Goya white beans >10 oz. bag frozen corn >1 t oregano or Italian seasoning >1 t ground coriander >1 t ground cumin >1 t salt > >Cooking the day before always enhances flavor! > >Top with a dollop of sour cream, avocado slice, cilantro sprig, fresh lime slice and provide cayenne pepper to let your guests add their own heat.

Definitely needs more liquid!!  I used 2 fairly large split breasts that were cooked up in the slow cooker the night before with olive oil and taco seasoning.  Not quite a pound, but close enough.  I used an equivalent amount of homemade broth (tasty result of slow cooking the chicken!) in place of the canned stuff and found that it was not enough.  So I added about 2 cups of tomato juice and a bit of water.  Used a cup (and then some) of salsa in place of the tomatillos and green chilis, just because I didn't have them. And I used about a cup of canned corn instead of fresh.  After letting it simmer for a while, I thought it was a little bland, so I added hot sauce, more cumin and taco seasoning.  NOW it was ready for dinner.  Kinda wish I made cornbread...

Really hearty and lots of flavor!  I made a double batch for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it.  Served with sides of sweet cornbread, salad, and grilled cheese.  Made in the crockpot and subbed green salsa for tomatillos.  I only used one can of chicken broth (for the double batch), and chili was still runny so I thickened it up with cornstarch and water.  Thanks for the recipe - it was exactly what I wanted!!!

This recipe was my first attempt at White Chili and I served it to my new son-in-law and daughter.  We loved it.  I used 1 large Chicken Breast and also added a few extra beans but it came out great.  I made it in the crockpot and just had it on low all day.  Top Knotch.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be making it alot this winter I'm sure.

This recipe is awesome!  Far better than any other white chili recipe I've tried.  I make it in my slow cooker, letting it cook on low all day.  I could not find the tomatillos so used salsa verde, which worked fine.  Otherwise, I did not mess with the ingredients, except that I increased the chicken to 2 lbs. and the beans to 2 cans, simply because I wanted a bigger yield.  Oh, and I used a can of corn rather than fresh, but I would definitely try this with fresh corn in the summer.  I've made this for my own family and for a work gathering, and it was a hit with both!  My 14 year old son calls this "the soup that smells like enchiladas"!

I used this recipe as a starting place!  I added a bottle of beer after cooking the onions and garlic and brought to a boil before proceeding with the recipe. I also added more spices to suit our tastes (more salt / more heat). When I was all done - I added a leftover bowl of cooked white rice that I had.  Doing that made enough to last a long time - some will be going in the freezer!  Adding the rice really stretches how far the food will go!!  Thanks!

This was good but it did NOT serve more than 2 children and 2 adults.  Luckily that's all it needed to feed but had I been depending on 9 servings it would have been quite disappointing!  I also used salsa verde instead of tomatillos.

I give it a 4 because I thought of it more as soup, not chili. I even added some cornstarch mix to it, to thicken it up. It had good flavor though. I made some cornbread with it, but I really liked eating it with Tostitos scoops, and sour cream. Might make again, but hubby isn't sold on it.

Got rave reviews yesterday at the tailgate!  I found Rotel makes a can of tomatillios with Lime and Cilantro, so used two of those and one can of Diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I used the salsa verde like others sugguested.  I boiled chicken breasts and then shredded it.  I cooked it all and then put in a slow cooker to simmer for several hours to let the flavors meld.  I also added some white sugar to cut down the heat!

all i can say is: oh my god, is this good.

sauteed a pound of chicken breast (chopped) with onions and garlic. didn't use the spicy peppers,(i don't like things too spicy), subbed medium salsa verde for the tomatillos, used a can of white beans and a can of red kidney beans. used a lot more chicken stock (28 oz.), thickened with 1/4 cup of parm. cheese and a little bit of pasted flour. used double the cumin. 
topped with shredded cheddar, a dallop of whole milk plain yogurt, and some avocado.

you can't top this recipe. my partner and i were sitting at the table saying "oh my god, this is SO good", every other bite.

Amazing recipe! I have searched for a chicken chili recipe and this is it! I did add a few things to spice it up a bit but overall it's a wonderful recipe. I added half a seeded, diced jalepeno instead of the canned chiles, 2 seeded and diced poblano peppers (very flavorful barely spicy), more garlic, paprika and chili powder. I like mine spicy and these additions really made it great. The most important ingredient was the salsa verde. I also could not find canned tomatillos so I used a jar of Pace Salsa Verde. That stuff is awesome! I sampled it with white corn chips and it was delicious. But then I dumped the entire jar into the chili and that was the key to the amazing flavor. Rather than using cooked chicken I diced three boneless breasts and threw those in with the onions at the beginning. I also added a can of corn and a can of red kidney beans because I love extra beans! Cooked this for almost an hour because I started with raw chicken and wanted the flavors to really meld. I did add some cornstarch at the end to thicken it so it was less soup-like. Served this with chopped cilantro on top, shredded cheese and a blob of sour cream. I also made the "honey cornbread" recipe from this site which is delicious! Goes great with any chili or soup. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I loved it!!

Wow.....easy in yet incredibly complex flavors.
Agree on the Salsa Verde substitution and addition of some red pepper flakes.
Do not under estimate the power of the finish....a good squeeze of lime,cilantro,sour cream,cheese and tortilla chips on top take this from delicious to sublime.
WOW

Absolutely wonderful. I would say this is a hearty and less spicy version of the Max and Erma's tortilla soup. Kind of a mixture of a soup and chili, but it was absolutely wonderful. I used the Salsa Verde and diced tomatoes with chilis. Added 2 lbs. of ground chicken and 2 cans chicken broth. To save on dishes, I softened onions and garlic in the main chili pot, then browned the ground chicken and added the spices. Once it was cooked though, I added everything else and let it simmer. Absolutely WONDERFUL (for anytime of year)!

This "chili" has a pretty good flavor and tastes better with sour cream and cheese on top. However, this recipe didn't produce what I would call a "chili" recipe. It was more of a mixture that would have gone into a taco or tortilla. Still, this recipe is worth making, if you have the inclination.

This was very good!

Used a rotisserie chicken I picked up at the store, frozen corn, salsa verde and omitted the coriander because I didn't have any.

Topped with sour cream, crushed tortilla chips and cheddar cheese.  

This is similar to another recipe on the site, but I liked the flavor the salsa verde gave.

This receipe was fabulous! The only thing I added was red peppers which my husband requested. It's good by itself, but we added the cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips and that made it out of this world! Highly recommended!

Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy! I didn't have any canned tomatoes or green chiles, so instead I used about a 1/4 cup tomato paste and 1/2 cup verde sauce. I also subbed canned corn for fresh, as fresh is off season. I recommend using a *tad* more of the spices and also simmering for an additional 20 minutes to really let the broth boil down. Will be making this again!

This chili is real good, I made it a bit too spicy, as I altered it a bit but it was alot better the next day.  Followed others suggestions... doubled it, used verde salsa in place of tomatillo sauce, extra garlic, 2 cans of tomatoes (we love tomatoes), frozen corn, and extra cumin.  My own additions were chili powder and cayanne pepper, like I said I did make it a bit too spicy ( I didn't measure the cayanne or chili powder)

Tasty,healthy and easy. I incoporated the other reviews and used what I had. I used two large chicken breasts which I seasoned and cooked on the bone. Instead of 7oz of chilis I used one 4oz can, 1/2 can chicken broth and I also replaced the tomatillos with 1/2 jar of green salsa. No corriander, cumin or garlic. I mixed all together with 1/2 and onion and 1 can of corn and cooked in crockpot on low for 8 hours. Not soupy, just right. Made 4 servings. I will defintately make again, thanks for this great recipe.

Excellent - I served 3 different kinds of Chili on Halloween and this is the only one that was completly gone.  I used a jar of salsa verde instead of tomatillos and precooked chicken (next time I'll cook my own).  Thanks for the great recipe.

I make this a lot and everyone loves it!  I modify it by adding an extra can of beans, Great Northern beans, a 1/2 block of cream cheese and extra green chiles.  I also skip the tomatillos and just do a jar of green salsa.

Loves this -- i had leftover chicken meat and was craving white chicken chili.  Of course, i changed a few things:  I used more garlic;  i added a can of black beans also;  i used home made chicken broth but didnt measure, so it was between 1 and 2 cups;  I used 2 small cans of tomatos with chilis (one was fiesta flavor), plus the can of chilis, and skipped the tomatillos;  i used one drained can of corn;  I threw in some leftover chicken gravy (homemade) which thickened it.  My 14 yo praised it and my hubby had seconds, and I was very satisfied.  I'm picky, so thats a good review for me!

Yummy! This is my new favorite cold weather recipe. I could not find canned tomatillos in my local grocery store, but I did find fresh ones which I used. I have never cooked w/ tomatillos before, but now I can't wait to find other recipes that include this ingredient. The chili was great 'as is' and even better with a dollop of sour cream on top. Also, this chili freezes well.

I also could not find canned tomatillos, so I used half of a 16 oz jar of Salsa Verde instead.  It turned out great!  Definitely a keeper.

I made a few changes.  For instance, I replaced the tomatillos and chiles with diced tomatoes with green chilies already mixed in.  I added chili powder instead of coriander, canned corn instead of fresh, two cans of beans instead of one, and I excluded the lime.  We finished it off with a nice handful of Mexican blend shredded cheese once we got it into the bowls and it was fabulous!

This stew was really good and easy to make.  I added another can of white beans because I didn't think that the recipe called for enoug.  The only thing that I would add next time would be some spice, maybe a hot chili pepper or something.  My boyfriend loves white beans and really liked this recipe.

We love this. This is great for a Sunday. I only recommend cooking longer so the flavors mix. We have made it both ways and prefer when it sits for awhile on low.

Absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure if I would really care for this, but I was so impressed.  My only modifications were to poach and shred the chicken ahead, just because I had the time, and to use tomatillo salsa in place of the canned tomatillos,which I couldn't find at my grocery store.  I only used about 1/2 cup of the salsa as I'm not a huge tomatillo fan, but I will probably add even a little more next time.  Due to the shredded chicken, the consistency of this was not that of a traditional chili, but it was incredibly tasty.  We topped it with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a few tortilla chips.  Everyone had at least a few bowls!  Definitely a keeper for us!

Nice taste. Though we thought it was more of a soup than a chili. Lacked the thickness and body we were looking for. Still a real pleaser.

A friend made this for a group and I enjoyed it so I made it myself.  Everyone loved it!  I used frozen corn instead of fresh and I added the chicken with the tomatoes, chili's and spices and cooked it slightly longer than suggested.  The chicken came out so soft and tender.  Great recipie!

A triple threat...Tasty, easy and good for you. You can really let your creativity run wild using this as a base and add chipotles or whatever you like. Don't tell anyone how quick it is too make, let them think you sweated over it.

Loved this recipe!  I almost didn't make it when I read one negative review.  But, I decided to take a chance--served this at a party and everyone wanted the recipe!  Changes I made:  only added one can diced tomatoes, one can white corn and 1/2 cup cream. Used 3 cans of cannellini beans.  Didn't use coriander as I didn't have any.  This is wonderful!!!

This was somewhere between soup and chili, but still delicious. I think this a great meal using any meat. I didn't have any chicken to use, so I did lean ground beef instead. Instead of fresh corn, I did one drained 14.5 oz can and one can of niblets (10 oz?) and it seemed to be the perfect amount. Instead of tomatillos, I did one 29 oz can of diced tomatoes, and one small can of tomatoes with chiles. I omitted the salt since I was using canned corn. Using the beef, it was still very good, and I think it would be good with ground turkey as well. I would maybe add some chili powder to the mix if I wanted it spicier, but the spices as-is are fine.

I had some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving so I thought I'd give the recipe a try. Very good! I tweaked it a little by adding some ancho chile powder to taste, doubling the cumin, and substituting one can of white pozole and one can of yellow pozole for the beans. I also omitted the corn. To thicken, I dissolved about one tablespoon of masa in a 1/4 cup of warm and added it to the pot, stirring well, and simmering for about 20 minutes. Will definately make this again!

My family challenged me to find a white bean recipe that did not call for ham or bacon.  I made three different recipies and this was the winner hands down.  Changes I made were...use of homeade chicken stock, no added salt, no corriander seed, substituted tomatillos, diced tomatoes and green chilies for 2 cans diced tomatoes with green chilies and 2 cans diced tomatoes seasoned with oregano/garlic/basil.  I couldn't find tomatillos anywhere.  I put one thin slice of lime on top of each bowl of soup right before serving.  Beautiful presentation and everyone raved about it.  Thank you for a new family favorite!!!

This was very good. I wasn't sure if I wanted to try this recipe since I was afraid it would taste like navy beans with salsa. That was not the case at all. The soup was very good and the white beans just made the soup creamy. My husband loved it and so did my kids. I will make this again.

This recipe was pretty good. I made it as per the directions, then added some hot sauce and chili powder. I also cut up striped of tortilla and layered it in a casserole dish with the chili. I added cheese on top and baked it for about 30 minutes. I liked the way the tortillas soaked up the chili a bit, they tasted like noodles. I will make this again.

I thought this was really good.  Even my wife who isnt much of one for beans liked it.  I did just use tomatoes instead of tomatilloes and also just for some added flavor to the broth stirred in 8 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese.

Excellent recipe. Tastes especially good with the lime, I put a couple of slices in the bowl with the chili when I serve it up. You can spice it up a little more by using the canned tomatoes that have chiles in them.

I've been making this recipe for the past several years now and my husband who loves spicy food absolutely loves it. I usually use a few cooked chicken breasts and shred them along with 1 lb of ground chicken. Like the other reviewers suggested, I add 1 jar of Mrs Renfro's Salsa Verde and a couple of cans of fire roasted tomatoes along with 2 cans of white beans (Aldi has Northern White beans for super cheap!). We throw everything in the crock pot for an easy no-fuss dinner and serve it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. It's even good on flour tortillas as a burrito type filling. Yum. 5 stars all the way.

Excellent - my entire family loved it and it's healthy!  I took the advice of others and doubled the diced tomatoes, using a brand that already had chilis in it.  Could not find tomatillos, so I did substitute with a small jar of salsa verde.  Had a little kick.  It was great!

Superb White Chicken Chili! Not only was it easy to prepare, it was delicious! And, unlike many chili's which "taste better the second day" this is tasty right off the bat! No waiting around for the flavors to meld.  I found the elusive tomatillos in a 14 oz can, so I used about 4 oz of tomatillo based green sauce to make up the difference.  I also heeded the advice of another reviewer and pureed an extra can of white beans and added it after the first boil to thicken it up since our preference is a thicker sauce.  I don't think that change significantly affected the taste, so I'd still give this one is 5 stars as written. My only "complaint" is was it was a tad sweet, but we realized it was the fresh corn, which was super sweet. Not something I'd knock off a star for since that can be controlled in the future. Oh, and I lightly dusted the chicken with some pepper, poultry seasoning and garlic salt and boiled it until it was just barely cooked through. This one is good enough to go into our rotation of meals to keep in the freezer for times we're feeling like something hearty, yet healthier than regular chili.

Awesome and easy to make. Modifications- shredded the chicken vs cubing, one can cannelinni beans, crushed tomatoes with one can Rotello, used a potato mashed to break up some of the beans, added one TBSP chili powder. Healthy alternative and tastes great- worth trying!

I made this tonight and WOW! I honestly have never had chicken chili before and I didn't think I would like it all that much. I made a few alterations because I couldn't find tomatillos. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a jar of ChiChi's salsa verde in the place of the tomatillos. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis (smaller cans, I think they were around 12 oz each. I cut the chicken breast up and browned it in a separate pan before adding to the soup. I used a whole bag of frozen corn, and I used 2 cans of canellini beans (with juice). I used 1/2 tsp of all the recommended spices listed, along with an extra 1/2 cup of water. It turned out AMAZING! SO much flavor! I topped it with sour cream, cheddar, and fritos, but honestly, it was great all on it's own! Definitely a winning low fat/cal recipe! TRY IT!

**** Update**** I made this again tonight... rather than using white beans, I used 2 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of black beans. It was delicious!

This was a good meal for our family.  The parents liked it a lot, the kids, not so much.  One reviewer recommended adding corn starch and I think we'll try that next time because it was a little thin but still very good.

Fantastic! I doubled the garlic and used fresh tomatillos and fire roasted green chilies. Upped the cumin to 1/2 tsp as well. So. Yummy, will pass this on and make again!

I have made this recipe for every Superbowl Party I've held for the last 3-4 years.  It is a huge hit!  I add canned Chipotle peppers or Chipotle hot sauce (not too much, however), a little white wine, frozen corn, and I grill the chicken first.  I pre-make it on the stove and then day of, put it in the crockpot, add the corn, chicken and beans, and cook it on slow for 4 hours to absorb all the flavors!  I also use plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream---gives it a decidedly different "kick"!!!  One of the best recipes I've ever found online!

An instant family favorite, even my picky 4 year old licked the bowl clean. My adjustments: 2 17 ounce cans of tomatoes with chilis, a few dashes of tapatia hot sauce, a lot more cumin ( other rater's suggestion), and 2 cans of white beans. Will definitely be making this again.

I really like this recipe. The flavor is good, without making much in the way of adjustments, other than just for ease. For example, I used a larger chicken breast because I just used the whole thing. Several of the ingredients didn't come in the amounts called for, so I just got as close as possible and went with it. Great chili, and super healthy!

This was a very easy and good recipe! I made it for friends and everyone loved it! I did make a few alterations! I was not able to add tomatillos due to being unable to find any. I enjoy spicy so I also added some chili powder. I like my chili with a little more tomato base and a bit thicker so I also added some tomato paste, flower, and sugar! It was my first time making chili and I will def be making this recipe again!

Like other reviewers, I used salsa verde for the canned tomatillos (I like the Frontera Grill brand) and cans of tomatoes with green chilis instead of the separate can of each.  When I make this, I grab a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shred it instead of using diced chicken.  I usually garnish it with lime wedges, avocado, shredded cheese, sour cream and cilantro.  My husband and I both LOVE it.

The best chicken chili I've ever had, by far. Just a few substitutions were made though.

Instead of the tomatillos, I used an 8oz can of salsa verde. Instead of the green chiles, I just diced up two fresh jalapenos. Instead of two ears of corn, I just used a single can. And I doubled the amount of beans.

Also, once everything was simmering, I stirred in three tablespoons of all-purpose flour to make a sort of roux and thicken everything up.

Definitely going to revisit this one.

Pretty good.  Your average, run-of-the-mill white bean chicken chili.  It was a little spicy, but you can cut that with some cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Made homemade tortilla chips.  Will make again.

This is five stars! I always laugh at the ...'I liked it but"....remarks. It certainly isn't white bean chili if you add black beans!  I had to substitute also.  No Tomatillas and NO salsa verde...so...What is in Salsa?  Hmmm..tomatoes, onions, cilantro, onion. garlic, etc. AND LIME JUICE!  I added lime juice.  Yummy.
My whole family loves this chili and I will bel making it again and again.

*****Very good and simple to throw together.  Didn't use ground coriander, I didn't have it but the oregano gave it great flavor by itself. Used jarred salsa verde instead of tomitillas and used diced tomatoes w green chilies instead of plain diced tomatoes.  Just enough spice to warm you up.

Excellent! Used leftover grilled chicken breasts. Didn't have tomatillos used two cans diced tomatoes instead. Added  about five shakes of franks hot sauce and a Tbs of canned jalapeño juice. Threw in some extra herbs and spices. Great pantry recipe!

Great recipe!  It was tasty, healthy and relatively inexpensive to make.  I like many others used Salsa Verde in place of the tomatillos. I also added more beans than the recipe called for, but only about a half a can.  I also simmered for about 40 mins or so on low. If you're in a rush then 10 mins is fine I'm sure, but the longer you simmer the more the flavors will marry and it will also thicken up a little ( I saw a few reviews that either added cornstarch or complained that is too thin.  It is more like a stew than a chili).  This will be a staple dinner in our house from now on!

This dish is very tasty and easy to make. But it's more of a soup then a chili. I followed the recipe. I would make it again...also great for a side soup/dish.

My family loved this. I altered just a little from reading other reviewers.   I added Salsa Verde & a can of Ro-tel & 3 cans of great northern beans, I skipped the corn & added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Delish----- A little too hot for me, but my family Loved it! This is a keeper

This has become a favorite in my household too. I've taken it to many a potluck and always have rave reviews. Sometimes I add more broth to make it a soup. Sometimes I make it with vegetable stock and extra beans in place of chicken to make it vegan. Today is New Year's day and I'm visiting in Texas and my transplanted family tells me you gotta eat Black Eyed Peas on new years for good luck so I'm using Black Eyed Peas in place of the white beans. A great recipe. Thank you!

Fabulous.  Everyone loved it.  I was worried some of my kids wouldn't like it because they could actually see chunks of tomato, but they all loved it.  I made a HUGE pot thinking I would have leftovers, and it was all eaten.  I used Salsa Verde and some fresh tomatoes chopped up because I couldn't find tomatillos and I used white beans soaked overnight then cooked for an hour instead of the canned beans.

So easy and so delicious!  I did what others recommended in regard to salsa verde, rotisserie chicken, corn starch, milk, and cilantro.  Adding sour cream, shredded cheese and scallions to the top took it to another great level.

This recipe was great. I modified it a little. I added cut up red potatoes and simmered them for about 20 min in broth before adding everything else. I also used trader joes Cowboy Caviar salsa sine it already had the peppers and corn in it. It added the perfect amount of spice. Topping ideas are endless...corn chips, avocado, sour cream, shredded cheese

My husband and I thought that this chili was delicious!  I used 3 fresh tomatoes (peeled & diced) and 6 fresh tomatillos (lightly roasted & diced).  I also used dried pinto beans and great northern beans that I soaked overnight and cooked while I prepped the veggies.  I omitted the green chiles as I was afraid that it would make the dish too  spicy for my five-year old.  Lastly, I used ground turkey instead of chicken.

I am very happy with this recipe and will be keeping it on regular rotation in my dinner repertoire as it is delicious and quite healthy.

Found this while looking for something quick to make.  Used part of  a store cooked chicken.  Used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos (don't know correct spelling) since I didn't have chiles.  I do not have coriander seed so made without. Also canned corn in place of the ears.  I thought it was great.  Served with a nice crusty bread.  Next time I will top  with the cheddar cheese I think!  Try this!

This has been a favorite recipe of our family for a couple of years now!  For me it is all about the tomatillos!  We always use fresh tomatillos since we have never found canned.   We triple the recipe as it goes quick.  This time (making it now) our grocery store didn't have enough fresh tomatillos so we used a jar of salsa verde.  We always add an extra can of beans too.  We did add some corn starch this time after reading the comments here.  YUMM-O!

whoaaa...i used salsa verde like another one suggested, and a small can of jalepenos.  I seasoned with some red pepper flakes and omitted the coriander (as i had none)....now, here's the best part...it was a little too thin for "chili" so I added some crushed tortilla chips to thicken...omg...went to heaven and back..this is the only recipe i've ever commented on....and i had to share.

This is my fiance's new favorite dish! I made just a couple of additions/substitutions: We couldn't find any decent salsa verde or canned tomatillos, so I pureed about a pound of fresh tomatillos in the food processor and added a tbsp each of salt and sugar, plus half a serrano pepper. We found that this gave it a very fresh, "green" flavor that was complemented by cilantro and lime for garnish. If you do this, drain and rinse your tomatoes so that the soup stays green. I used frozen corn rather than fresh, and about a tbsp of cumin as well. Crushed Hint of Lime Tostitos on top. Yum!

The family loved this soup.  I didn't have any canned tomatillos, so just used a can of Rotel Mild.  I also added a can of tomato sauce since I had more than 1 lb of chicken in the pot.  Very tasty and will make again!

I give this 5 stars because it is fantabulous......even though I will make some very minor adjustments for my liking next time around.  As is, it has a wonderful flavor and tastes great.  I used fresh tomatillos out of my garden.  The chile peppers were also from the garden and I broiled until black and removed the skins before chopping them & adding them to the mix.  Next time I may broil ALL the veggies before adding them because I love the richer flavor that broiling gives them.  I am also going to add some more spicy in way of japs or serranos and then top with sour cream & cilantro.  The cornstarch sounds like a good additive to thicken as well it but these are all PERSONAL PREFERENCES - this recipe is AMAZING as is and I rated it accordingly!!  I'm not sure how everyone else can rate your recipe with all their tweeks because ITS NOT YOUR RECIPE anymore once they alter it!!!  Thank you for another great way for me to use my TONS of tomatillos & peppers growing in my garden this year!!!

I hate to change a recipe so much and rate it but after reading reviews... I doubled everything in the recipe except the chicken broth, used tomatoes with chillis in place of the plain diced, salsa verde in place of the tomatilios, fresh serrano chilles instead of canned jalapenos and frozen corn for the fresh. I served with fresh chopped avocado.  Everyone thought this was incredibly tasty, and I thought it was incredibly easy!

This tastes AMAZING and it isn't even finished cooking yet. I jazzed mine up a bit. I decided to used real chicken breast, probably about 2 lb's. I sauteed the chicken,onion and about 3 or 3 1/2  cloves of garlic. Seasoned with a little salt,pepper, garlic powder and chili powder while cooking. I decided to use a crock pot. Pureed 1 can white beans and a can whole green chilies to thicken soup. Added 2 cans of white beans,2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 jar salsa verde,1 can low sodium sweet corn,drained. I boiled 15 oz of water and dissolved to chicken bullion cubes and added that to crock pot. I then added my chicken,onion and garlic mix to crock pot. I seasoned with: 3 tbsp parsley, 1 tbsp chili powder,1 tbsp oregano,1/2 tsp cumin,1/2 tsp ground coriander seed, 1 bay leaf, Salt, Pepper and Garlic Powder to taste( Probably a tbsp. this is my house seasoning I use on everything 1/4 tsp garlic powder,1/4 tsp pepper,1tsp salt and just bulk it up in a shaker.) Mine made up to a lot since I basically doubled the recipe for my family. This is really good. Will serve with some sour cream and shredded Monterrey Jack. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! I shredded the chicken first and added it in as directed... It was delish and easy to eat! I also added a south African smoke spice mixture from trader joe's that gave the dish a whole new dimension

My husband and I both love this recipe!  Perfect when you have leftover chicken.  I did modify based on some other reviews I read.  I replaced the tomatillos with a jar of salsa verde.  I diced up a jalapeno instead of the can of green chiles.  Also used 2 cans of white beans instead of one.  It has a wonderful flavor but still spicy.  Great even for leftovers!  Thanks for the go to soup recipe!

This was pretty good.  I threw everything into the crockpot (chicken was pre-cooked with spices), left out the coriander and oregano, but added cornstarch and a can of cream of chicken soup (low-fat) to help thicken it up.  I also blended the tomatoes and chilies in my magic bullet because I don't like chunks of tomatoes.  Worked great!  Cooked on low for abut 6 hours, and it was tasty!

Delicious! Used fresh tomatillos instead of canned, and frozen corn instead of fresh. Only made a half recipe, but used a full can of bean and full amount of cumin. Finally, used full can of tomatoes with diced green chiles in them, rather than 1/2 can of each.

So good!! I added more chicken by personal choice (2 pounds total), and had to use fresh tomatillos because I couldnt find canned - I'd rather use fresh anyway.  Went out of town and hubby asked me to make a double batch for him to eat while I was away.  Will make again soon!

Very nice.  As others did, I changed a few things.  I used a can of corn--no fresh corn right now in this house--and ground turkey instead of shredded chicken.  I, too, could not find tomatillos and subbed salsa verde instead.  I probably could find them at an international store, but I was at Wegman's.  The salsa verde gave it a nice bite, though, which I liked.  I cooked this in the crockpot on low all day--probably about 10 hours, and it was very good.  Bf's sister in law loved it.  thanks for the recipe!

Awesome high protein meal. I didn't realize how spicy it would be but still delicious. Next time I won't use the chiles. Very good for my diet!! Only 217 calories for 2 cups.

My family and I really enjoy this recipe.  I usually use a jar of tomatillo salsa and omit the can of green chiles since they're already in the salsa.  I puree the beans so my kids don't know they're in there.  I serve it with tortilla chips and monterrey jack cheese.  Yum!

I'm not much of a cook so I was little afraid to try this recipe because I was tend to mess up non-basic things but this was by far one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life.  I couldn't find the canned tomatillos so I used chile verde salsa and it was excellent.  Definitely, a MUST try!

I used dry navy beans that I soaked overnight and left out the chicken. It cooked 10 hours in my slow cooker on low. Also I didn't have fresh corn so I added frozen corn 20 min before serving. Very yummy!

This was very good.  I made a few changes only because I was snowed in and couldn't get to the store.
I didn't have corn so I subsituted it with hominy.  I also added one can of rotel as I didn't have tomatillos.  It turned out very good.  Thanks for posting it.

This chili is delicious!  I had to substitute a few items I didn't have (Campbell's Creamy Chicken soup for broth, extra canned tomatoes with chilies for the tomatillos, and extra cumin for the coriander), but it still turned out great.  It was nice and spicy, which was perfect for a cool night.  The only downside I found was it took closer to 90 minutes to prepare rather than the 35 minutes estimated.  Part of this was because the recipe doesn't account for the time it takes to cook the chicken.  Regardless, I will definitely prepare this chili again.

Also, I froze about half of the chili in a GladWare container.  I was amazed at how well it froze and defrosted.  It tasted as good from the freezer as it did when I first prepared it.

I really enjoyed this chili and used some of the suggested modifications.  I add one: to help thicken the chili take about a quarter cup of beans from the chili and some broth, blend this together and put back in the chili.  Helps thicken the chili using only what is already there.

Very delicious. Unfortunately I didn't have corn in my kitchen, but the dish still prepared wonderfully. I did replace diced tomatoes with a can of tomato sauce, and I even added a little heavy whipping cream out of curiosity.

I was looking for something to make, with what I had in the house. I had to make a few changes, but it basically looked like the picture. I thought it was like a "tomato" version of white chicken chili. My grocery store does not carry tomatillos in a can, so I went with salsa verde like other reviewers. The salsa I used already had jalepeno peppers, so I left out the green chilis. Instead of yellow corn, I just used a drained can of white hominy. It was actually my favorite part of the soup. It needed a little more flavor, and I added a couple pinches of garlic salt which helped, at the end. I thought there was way too much heat or spiciness, though, especially since I did not use the chiles. Adding some cheddar cheese to the top of my bowl helped. It was filling, but not quite good enough to make again.

Annual Chili Contest Winner!!  Also used salsa verde as a substitute after reading other reviews and shredded a Rotisserie Chicken which added LOTS of flavor.  I also added a jalapeno for extra kick but it wasn't too spicy for those that don't like spicy chili.  This chili instantly became my husbands favorite!

I have made this recipe several times, and I do  not use tomatillos or coriander.  The first time I made it I didn't have these ingredients, and left them out--was delicious without.  Also, I just use the Rotel tomatoes witht the green chiles in them and a couple cans of diced tomatoes.  This soup is so wonderful, and it is even better the next day.  I usually crush up tortillas and add shredded cheddar when serving--to die for!!

Yummy-I used a bottle of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos because that's what I had, spicy tomatoes, and doubled the spices for more heat. Very good and very quick and easy-can't beat that!

So tasty! I didn't have an green chiles, but did have a can of diced tomatoes that had green chiles in them. It was perfect and added just the right amount of heat- also kept things simple. Will make again!

YUMM!! This is amazing!! Couldn't find tomatillos so I used an 18oz jar of Archer Farms salsa verde. Used a fresh jalapeno instead of a can of chiles. Used frozen corn instead of fresh. Added about 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup of cream at the end to thicken it up. This is SO good!

Made this chili with the following amendments for my grocery store didn't have canned tomatillos: I used two small cans of salsa verde (like other reviewers) and, as I wasn't about to spend $11 on ground coriander seed, I omited it.  Served with shredded sharp american cheese and sour cream.  It is delicious!!!  Next time I will double the recipe - it's THAT GOOD.

I made a double recipe of this exactly as written for a group pot luck lunch on a cold day.  My husband 'taste tested' before I left, liked it a great deal, and I promised to bring home what was left.  Sadly NONE was left.  Others requested the recipe.  I've made this again since, and same result...no leftovers!  The tomatillas are a little hard to work with (stringy and gooey), but they add so much to the end result.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it as it was written and entered it in my work's chili cook off. I won "Most Original" with the use of the chili and tomatillos. My family loves it too.

Very delicious! The boyfriend loved it :)
I made a roux and added it to the prepared stew towards the end of cooking which thickened it up nicely. Also added diced red pepper, which was a good addition. 

Thanks!

I've made this chili several times, and my whole family loves it!  I also use two cans of corn and two cans of chili to thicken it up, and tonight I'm going to try using a small amount of Rotel hot diced tomatoes with habaneros to spice it up a little.  I also have always used salsa verde instead of tomatillos, and it always turns out delicious!  Great with crispy tortilla strips and sour cream on top, and a great winter meal.  We love it more than ground beef chili!

This was very good ... I didn't have any tomatillos, so I skipped them ... used a can of corn, instead of fresh ... added extra cumin and coriander and about a TBSP of red pepper flakes.  Will definitely make again, it was a hit!

Surprisingly easy AND delicious! Almost too good. I made some tweaks: I used ground chicken from the farmer's market instead of diced chicken; like some other reviewers, I used verde salsa instead of tomatillos (jalepeno verde salsa for a delectably hot kick!); I doubled the beans (one can pinto, one can black beans), tomatoes and broth; and I added some chopped fresh carrot and celery. 

I will definitely be making this again! I even blogged about it on my soup blog it was so good!

I think this recipe would have turned out super delicious, but i think i used the wrong kind of tomatillos. i think i used puree, so it was very very vinegary. i will have to make it again!

This is a pretty solid recipe, but did require a little tweaking.    I made two versions, one vegetarian with a soy chicken substitute and one regular.   The regular version was made a tall skillet pan and actually required additional liquid to be added, so we added a cup of beer and a little milk. The other veggie version cooked in a Dutch oven required cornstarch to thicken it up.  I added one poblano pepper and one jalapeño pepper to each batch.  I roasted 5 tomatillos along with the peppers in the oven, then added them into the chili, and only did half the amount of Verde salsa (as substituted by other reviewers).   In addition, in the veggie version I added about ½ tsp of chipotle pepper seasoning.   In order to get the right consistency and absorb the flavors this needed to be cooked down for at least 3 hours.

I have been eyeing this one for a while and finally made it last night.  Quick, easy, and delicious - we all loved it!!  I used a salsa verde instead of the tomatillos like some of the variations suggested, and topped it with crushed tortilla chips, sharp cheddar cheese and pico de gallo.  I thought it had just enough kick, and best of all tasted like I had it simmering in a pot all day!  I will be making this one again.

Just made this. With the recipe as shown, I was dissapointed because it was too soupy. I followed suggestions like adding flour to thicken it and added a bit more cumin. "I loved it and the flavor was great"-my eight year old daughter. My husband and I added about 2 tbsp. of salsa to our bowls.

Excellent flavor, a nice change from traditional (beef) chili & stays w/ you on those chilly winter days.  I subbed a can of Southwestern Style corn for the ears , doubled the beans & cooked it in the crock pot all day.  Couldn't ask for easier, especially when it's this good--my neighbor approved too.  Definitely goes into the regular rotation!

I found this to be entirely too sweet and soupy. The only change I made was to use salsa verde rather than tomatillos. 4 people ate it, none of us liked it. It's too soupy and doesn't have that traditional flavor I was used to in white bean chili.

Made this for a Christmas get-together at our library. It takes a lot to keep Chiefs fans away from a game, but this recipe worked. Next year, I'll budget for cable TV so they can watch and have a second bowl. Thanks Thea!

Excellent recipe. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and it was delicious. I followed the directions, adding an extra can of beans. I left the chicken until the last minute, dividing the rest of the chili into two pots. In one, I added the chicken. In the other, I added tofu chunks for my teenage son, the vegetarian. He liked it and it was an easy way for me to make two different dishes at the same time. Thanks for the recipe, Thea!

Delicious. I would definitely make again. I used a bag of frozen corn instead of fresh, which tasted fine. Next time, I'd add an extra can of white beans and maybe a jalapeno for some added kick.

This chili is AWESOME!!  I've never been able to make a repeatable chili, but this one is a keeper!  I modified the recipe too because I like a thicker chili.  Based on other reviews I doubled the amount of chicken and beans.  Then I replaced the Salsa Verde with our favorite restaurant salsa (3 cups).  My kids LOVED it but they sure drank a lot of milk! Just a bit spicy chili.  :-)

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  The only thing that I'd change next time is that I'll shred the chicken instead of dicing it.  It reminded me more of chicken tortilla soup than a chili but definitely something that I'll make again.

Love this recipe, as does everyone I've served it to.  I'd consider it more of a stew since itdoesn't really have that traditional chili taste to me, but that is ok with me. I make a few substitutions as well.

I used fresh tomatoes, tomatillos, chillies, and corn (from our CSA box).  I didn't have coriander seed.  We enjoyed this with flat bread.

I wasn't a fan of this recipe.  I enjoy the simple turkey chili over this one ten-fold. I even attempted it with the suggestions of previous reviews, and still wasn't impressed.

This was an absolute hit with the kids. I used the green salsa instead of tomatillos. We made corn cakes to go with and it was a great fall meal.

This is an amazing and quick recipe to make. Like other reviewers I made it my own. I cooked the chicken with 6 cups of water with the spices along with the onion and garlic in the pressure cooker. This way the broth was very aromatic and less salty. After shredding the chicken I put the rest of the ingredients in the broth and let it simmer for 1/2 hour). Served it with sour cream and diced avocados. A winner for a fall evening.

Excellent!  This tastes so good and is very easy to make.  Great flavors! My changes are: I used ground turkey, salsa verde instead of the tomatillos, canned corn, added diced jalapeños, more cumin, added a little bit of chili powder, added some diced fresh tomatoes and cornstarch to thicken it up. Topped with sour cream and cheese.  I will definately make this again and again and again...

Excellent recipe!!! I made this for my very picky wife and parents and the loved it!!!   I made some modifications  to the recipe such as adding Salsa Verde, fresh tomatoes, jalapenos, green chilies.  I opted to slow cook everything together.  Took about an hour to get the chicken tender.  It was worth the wait.  I served the chili with diced onions and coriander.     This is an easy recipe to follow so don't be hesitant in trying it.    Enjoy.  Mick

Eh. I wouldn't flush it or anything, but it was only so so.  Definitely DON'T use canned tomatillos, those were gross and I can't see that they added anything to the recipe, I'd use fresh next time.

I love this recipe but have made a few adjustments just to make it a bit easier: Skip the tomatillos, diced tomatoes, green chillies, and fresh corn.  Instead of all of these I pour in a 16 oz jar of salsa. Pace chunky is my favorite and I use a medium spicy.  I also throw in a can of corn and for the white beans I use a can of northern beans and don't drain them.   If you want to make the chili thicker you can puree another can of northern beans...I've done it both ways.  I prefer to leave it thinner just to be easy.

Excellent and so easy! The following subs will make it 5 stars: up the spices to 1/2 T cumin, add 1 tsp paprika and 1tsp coriander. Add fresh squeezed juice of 1 lime. As others I subbed salsa verde for the tomatillos and used 2 cans of beans.

SO good!  Everyone loved it.  I used the Rotel can that said "chili fixins" for the tomatillos and put some green chile enchillada sauce in it instead of the can of chiles, and frozen corn worked great.  I thought it was better the next day.  Have to eat with shredded cheese and sour cream!

This was a delicious meal. Couldn't find canned tomatillos, so used fresh and chopped in blender. I used small slices of halpeno peppers around the dish to add a little more heat for those who needed a little extra fire. Will definetly make this again and soon.

Great recipe especially if you are short on time! I didn't have the coriander or the tomatillos and can't wait to try this again with them. Had company over and it was devoured, the kids especially loved it and it wasn't too spicy. I added garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of red pepper flakes, salsa and canned corn since I didn't have fresh corn. I also served a hot salsa on the side as a garnish for those that like it a little more spicy.

I am OFFICIALLY converted from turkey to chicken chili.  I went with the suggestion made by others to use salsa verde instead of the tomatillos (which are an ingredient in salsa verde, for anyone who's curious).  Also, I substitued two small serrano peppers for the green chiles (b/c I think the canning process sometimes makes chiles taste funny).  I also cooked cooked chicken breast with the onions and garlic, because I didn't have any already cooked.  I don't think this fundamentally changed the recipe, but it did save me an extra pan.  Once the chicken was cooked through, I just added the other ingredients to it.  I also left out the corn for personal preference, and I think it was pretty spectacular.  This is a great one pot meal!

This was ridiculously good!  DH said it's better than my regular chili.  Made changes suggested by other reviewers- used salsa verde instead of canned tomatillos and added 2 T or cornstarch.  I used diced tomatoes that had jalapenos.  Since I roast and freeze my own green chilis I used ~10oz of hot Hatch variety, and also used sweet corn I had frozen over the summer.  Cooked for a little longer to let it thicken.  Served with shredded cheese and corn tortilla strips.  Will be making this one again soon!

AMAZING taste!  Yum!  I used chicken sausage b/c it is what I had.  I also used Tomatillo salsa b/c I couldn't find canned tomatillo.  Next time I will use half the tomatillos salsa or stew my own tomatillos (I was able to find fresh tomatillos).  Either I used way too much tomatillo salsa or the spices in the chicken sausage made it a 5 alarm chili!  WOW.  And *I* like spicy!!  My 17 year old son that likes spice really liked it!!  But, although the flavor was SO very good...I couldn't eat it as leftovers.  You really need the extra toppings...ahhh...all of those added are so good!  And, if you make it too spicy the sour cream tones that down a bit.  My 19 year old son that doesn't like spicy soo much ate it with TONS of sour cream in it :o)

I have made this a few times and also used it for entertaining a lage group, as it is easy to double. I substituted salse verde for the tomatillos and shredded the chicken breasts. Overall, it's a great recipe and very easy to customize to your own personal preferences!

Made this last night in the skillet. I was a little disappointed last night and had wished it would've sat in the crock pot all day to mend all the flavors together. But then had leftovers today and it was delicious. When made in skillet it's definitely better after sitting over night! YUmmm!

The only changes I made were omitting tomatillos entirely and not replacing them with anything (just weren't on sale this week.) I didn't add anything to thicken it, used cheddar and fat free sour cream on top. Also used garlic powder instead of cloves. Turned out great! Filling yet light, unique flavor, satisfying meal without being overly wholesome. I recommend serving w/ garlic bread on the side. Also I used Tyson canned white chicken, still tastes fabulous, great recipe, nothing like 'regular' chili! :)

This has become a standard in our house now for dinner.  However, I leave out all the spicy items and I exchange black beans for white.  It's healthy and delicious--- and great with cornbread on the side!

I am giving this 5 stars eventhough I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used 2 cans of tomatoes becuase I didn't have tomatillos.  I didn't have the chilis or coriander (i had whole but i couldn't crush it) so I substituted with some chili powder, red pepper flakes and Cheyane red pepper.  I added more spices and S&P to my tastes.  Also didn't have fresh corn so I used canned.  It still came out so yummy! I served it to some friends on a late night and it worked wonders! It was especially good with sour cream and cheddar. I'm going to see what the chili cookers at work think about it.  I be they'll be impressed.

This was VERY good.  I was unable to find the tomatillos so I substituted a can of Rotel and a jar of tomatillo salsa (made for quacamole).  very good.  I thought the splash of lime juice added a great little zing!!  Will plan to make again.

Very flavorful and zesty, but salty!  There are quite a few canned ingredients in this recipe so it is easy for the salt to pile up.  I did use unsalted canned tomatoes, but if I made this again, I would use unsalted beans and low-salt chicken broth too.  I wasn't able to find canned tomatillos, so I substituted La Victoria Thick n Chunky salsa verde which is medium hot.  I think that the type of tomatillos or salsa verde used has a big impact on the flavor, saltiness, and spiciness of this recipe.

FANTASTIC!!! This is the first time I've ever had or made white bean chili and I was amazed! We used 1 can of corn instead of fresh corn and had to use green enchilada sauce instead of tomatillos (or salsa verde) as our store didn't have either (living on a military base overseas so our options are limited). Per other reviews, I also added about 2T cornstarch to thicken it up. It had a bite to it (and I'm a wuss) so I sprinkled cheese and added about 2 tsp sour cream and it was perfect! This will definitely be one we keep and make over and over again!!!

I made this for our neighborhood chili cook-off and won "Most Creative Taste!"  I replaced the tomatillos like the other reviewers did with the salsa verde and used 2 cans of Rotel with mild peppers. The lime at the end, as another review mentioned, is definitely key and gives it a little something extra.

The dish is mis-named, as tomatillos are really the featured ingredient in this recipe.  If you love tomatillo favor, do not change a thing in the recipe (although I would recommend roasting fresh tomatillos under the broiler instead of using canned). However, if you are like my husband...he said the chili needs more spice, more broth, and less tomatillos! Try adding more cumin and some actually red chili powder to give this recipe more kick!

This was the first time I had ever made white chili, and now my family is hooked!!  I used the liquid from boiling the chicken (I used dark) a jar of salsa verde because I couldnt find canned tomatillos, 2 cans of green chilies, fresh tomatoes, 2 red bell peppers, 3 cans of white beans, and cornmeal to thicken.  I know is sounds like alot of changes, but I wanted to make extra.. It turned out sooooo good.  I served it with sourcream, jack cheese, green oinions and tortilla chips.  I will keep this recipe, and I'm sure next time I will tweek it again, because thats just what I do.

I love this recipe.  It is a great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken.  You really can't go wrong once you put in the seasonings.  I have added leftover salsa, extra chicken stock (I use homemade) salsa verde, fresh tomatillos, you name it, I have varied it and it is always scrumptious!  I like it as a soupy consistancy and serve it with crushed corn chips or fried strips of corn tortillas.  This is a winner

this was a wonderful dinner option! it was very filling.  i used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to cook both the chicken and the onions and garlic.  i used minced garlic b/c i had it at home. i used white pepper and anise seeds instead of corriander seeds. i also used fresh oregano from my garden. i paired it with mex cheese, tortila chips and sweet avocado sprinkled w/ lime a sea salt.  it was a hit! i was looking for a more WHITE chili recipe but i found this to be really hearty and will continue to use this recipe!

Dish was simple, I made a few changes to really fill up my crew.  I added one link of turkey sausage, and one cup of cooked rice.  I cooked the chicken first and added the sausage to it and cooked them together.  I cooked the rice in the microwave and set it to the side.  When I was done with step 2 of the recipe I dumped the remaining ingredients, chicken, sausage and rice in a pot and let it cook until the water was down to a level I liked.  I didn't want a really watery chili.  I have small children and they wouldn't care too much for that.  I served with grands biscuits and the cheese and sour cream on the chili.  It was a success.

Yummo!! I just made this for my husband last night and he raved about it! I took the advice of some of the others comments and also added some other things that we love. We love garlic in this house, so I doubled that. I also added 2 stalks of celery, 1 orange bell pepper and a jalepeno. I traded a 1/2 tsp of paprika for the corriander. I also took 1/3 of the beans and mashed them before putting them in, just to make the chili thicker. Like many others, I used green enchilada sauce instead of tomatillos and used canned corn. It pairs well with roasted tortillas! Fantastic recipe!!! Great job!

We LOVED this recipe.  Although, I'm calling it Mexican Chicken Soup from now on.  I skipped the tomatillos and salsa verde all together and just added about a cup of Medium heat salsa.  Also use done can of Rotel in lieu of diced tomatoes.  We topped it with shredded mozzarella and sour cream.  Wow- fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious!  This would be a great recipe to bring to a gathering as you could make it ahead.  We had it for dinner one night with cornbread as a side.  A few days later we had the leftovers again...I just added a little more chicken broth when warming it up.  Used the salsa verde as well.  I did see the tomatillos at the store..but wasn't sure because I have never used them.. I will be making this again.

My husband loved this so much, he requested it again 3 days later! Very easy dish to adapt, too. I used ground chicken to make it easier, and added other beans along with the white beans (kidney, pinto). The lime, cilantro, cheese, and sour cream really add to the chili. This is a keeper!

This is absolutely delicious.  With the lime it has a taste all of its own and add the sour cream and crushed corn chips and it's a winner!

My family liked this. However, I couldn't find any canned tomatillos, so I read a reviewer used salsa verde and I tried that. It was good but a bit on the spicy side, my kids  had to drink a lot of water with it. :)

This is a really yummy chicken chili, but don't limit yourself to just white beans.  I've made it using black beans, red kidney beans, and various combinations of beans and have come up with some interesting flavors and textures.  And don't forget the chopped fresh cilantro!  Also...for a garnish I like to take several flour (or corn) tortillas and cut them into 2 inch long strips.  I then deep fry them until golden and sprinkle them with a little salt. They go beautifully with this chili.

My only changes were ubstituting salsa verde for the tomatillos and canned corn for fresh.  It couldn't have been simpler to assemble. Dee-licious!

I love this recipe!!!  
I have made it a few times...

I also used salsa verde in place of the tomatillos, used either canned or frozen corn - although i'm sure fresh would be absolutely delicious... 

The last few times I've made this Ive used boneless chicken thighs seasoned with garlic salt, cumin and coriander then on the grill to cook and then chopped... 

Today, its sleeting out so I'm trying the chicken baked in the oven first, rubbed with adobo seasoning.  We'll see...

As other reviewers have, I used the canned diced tomatoes with the green chilis... 

This recipe is soooo easy and so yummy. 

Serve with lime wedges (adds interesting flavor when squeezed on top - but dont add lime to the chili, its a very overbearing flavor throughout), sour cream and shredded cheese...

Yum! I can't wait until its done...

I thought this was really good.  I used the Archer Farms verde salsa instead of tomatillos as suggested and doubled the beans and chicken broth to make sure we had enough for our guests (6 of us).

REALLY good stuff - I'll be making this again.  Of course I doctored, as I always do.. added a couple jalapenos (I like heat), more garlic, used frozen corn (don't do canned veggies) and threw in chopped fresh cilantro at the end of the cooking cycle.  Unlike others, I didn't need to thicken with corn starch - instead I let the stew simmer much longer than recommended, for multiple reasons.. the flavors melded better and the sauce thickened naturally.

This was very good. I used the advice of the Green Salsa and jalepeno. The chicken I used some left over fajita meat from the previous night which had red and yellow bell peppers and sauted with garlic and onions. I also, added some cooked zucchinis. It was a bit to hot for my son who likes spicy food (jalapeno must of been extra hot). The optional items shouldn't be optional the lime and cilantro really made the taste Served with quesadillas. Thanks for the great recipe! (I would consider this more of a soup than a chili). Made this again following the directions exactly. It was great! Using fresh corn tasted really good. I cut up the green chilis since I didn't buy chopped I think it enhanced the taste.

We all really enjoyed this.  I doubled the recipe and the results were terrific!  I crushed a few tostadas and threw them in the pot at the end as a thickening agent. Served with avocado, fat free sour cream and additional tostadas.

I thought this was a glorious recipe.  I did make some subtle changes, after reading the reviews on here I opted to go for the Salsa Verde substitute.  I also added a can of Rotel in place of the green chili's.  I made it with Ground Turkey instead of chicken and it was good that way too!  I think this is a versitle recipe.

Truly excellent chili! Even better dressed up with a little cheddar cheese and crunchy tortilla strips! The Archer farms jar of chili verde suggestion from a previous review worked out very well.

This was pleased with this recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I did use half real tomatillos and half salsa verde. On my serving I added some red pepper flakes and sriracha sauce to my bowl to spice it up, which gave it a nice kick! I would make this again.

awesome.  i used salsa verde instead of tomatillos too.  if it's too runny, just simmer it over low heat until it thickens.
cut the chicken into small cubes.  i also added cilantro to the recipe at the end.  oh- and i subbed a jalepeno for the chilis - was spicy and yummy.

My husband loves chili, and since we live over in Italy, you can't find chili powder to make the traditional chili.  This is a great alternative to it!  I think he ate about 4 bowls at dinner!

I took the advice of the others and substitued the salsa verde, yummy.  I also added a bit more broth as someone suggested, but it was too much and had to try and thicken with some flour and water.  If I used the suggested amount of chicken broth I would have been fine.  It was very good, and as always, the second day was much better.

I loved this recipe, but I did change it around a little. I couldn't find any canned tomatillos, so I added two 7.5 oz cans of green tomatillo salsa. It is a little on the spicy side, but still adds a very mild flavor. I ommited the green chiles because of the spiciness from the salsa. I loved it! My husband and I ate the leftovers the next day with a little quinoa and some cheese on a corn tortilla. It was delicious! I definately recommend this recipes, I will probably make it again but use fresh tomatillos instead of the canned tomatilla salsa since it wasn't too spicy, but still a little spicy for my tastes.

This is the ultimate "Comfort Food."
I made a few changes, only because we like things spicy.
3 cloves of garlic
2 16oz chicken broth
1 large bottle of Salsa Verde
2 cans of Rotel Tomatoes and Peppers(original) DRAINED
1 can of diced jalepenos
1 16oz.pk. frozen WHITE corn
1 TBS. chili powder and cayenne (each)
1 TBS. Ms. Dash Extra Spicy (replaces salt)

I also precooked my skinless chicken breasts in some bouillon.

I had to comment on this recipe. It is so good I just had a bowl for breakfast.

This recipe is outstanding!! I added 2 cans of chicken broth and one can of butter beans. I also put 1/2 of the broth through the food processor before adding the beans/meat, which gave it a nice and creamy base. This recipe is one to keep and make several times a year!

This is a great recipe! I spiced it with about a half tsp. of red pepper flakes since I didn't have any hot peppers. I also added some black beans with the white beans and a little extra cumin. I'd give it more stars if I could!

I LOVED this recipe.  It is so flavorful. I added a fresh "salsa verde" instead of plain tomatillo. This is the key ingredient and must be fresh and yummy.  I added garbonzo beans and white beans.  I also added a orange pepper.  It is perfect with avacado, blue corn chips and cheese!

Great!  I used the salsa verde as others and it very flavorable.  Be sure to use all the "extras"...avacodo,lime, cheese, etc.  This will become a regular,

This is a great Chili..and as far as I can tell it appears to be quite healthy too. I am a college student and this took care of my lunches and dinners for 3 or 4 days. My roommate also enjoyed it very much. We both agreed that it was the best Chili we've ever eaten.

Fantastic recipe!  Not only was it easy to make and delicious, but it is healthy and makes for a very colorful, appetizing presentation.  After reading other reviews, I also substituted the tomatillos (could not find them) with mild salsa.  (Although, if you like your chili spicy, a salsa with more heat would do the trick.)  I also used canned corn and cut back on the chicken broth by half, since I wanted the chili to be think and not soup-like. I topped each dish off with a few raw diced onions, shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of cream cheese.  This recipe will definitely become a regular in our house.

I don't really understand the hype on this recipe.  I made it exactly like the directions said to and it was okay at best.  It was a bit too spicy and it just tasted like a bunch of canned things poured together. I love chicken chili, but I won't make this one again.

So delicious and quick! It turns out perfectly every time.  I've made it for a few years now and someone ALWAYS wants the recipe.  I use an already roasted chicken from the store, and canned corn rather than fresh.  We top with cheese, chips, sour cream, cilantro and you have got to squeeze the lime on your own bowl...MMM...delicious!

I thought that this was a good recipe~like the flavor comes from the spices and not fat (healthy ;) ) It was easy to make. for sure. I was surprised, though, thought that it would have been a bit more tasty, from the reviews that I have read. Mine came out to be more of a soup. I didn't have the tomatillos?(substitued more diced tomatoes) and wonder if that would have made it even better...??? I added two chicken boullion cubes and 1/4 cup of worstershire sauce....Will be making this again.

You can "wing it" with this recipe and be confident of good results. I used cooked ground turkey breast, two jars of European white beans, sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil, used salsa verde instead of tomatillos, and a bit of roasted red pepper tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes. I also used a vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, and added a pinch of chili powder. Nice flavor, quick meal. It is spicy, but my boys like it hot, so it worked well for us. I would prepare this again.

This was great, but boy was it spicy.  I had never cooked with tomatillos before and I didn't know how spicy it would be.  Used two cans of white beans, other than that followed the recipe directly.  It is a little soup like, even with a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch.  I generally like my chili a little thicker, but I would make this again.

This was the best chili I have ever had! I sauteed the chicken in olive oil  (instead of veg. oil) with the onions and garlic to save time.I followed others' suggestions and used salsa verde (from Trader Joes) instead of tomatillos and added 2T of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of skim milk. I also added 2T of cumin, and omitted the corn. I served the chili with some fat-free sour cream and club crackers. My b/f and I both had 2 bowls, and there was still enough left over for dinner tomorrow night.

This was sooooo delicious!  I made this two days ago and I'm making some more today.  I subbed the tomatillos for salsa verde and I didn't have any ground coriander but it was fantastic.  I also added more chicken than in the recipe for the added protein.

This was a great recipe! It was so easy to make, many flavors going on in 1 pot! I let mine cook about 30 minutes longer than suggested and I also used 2 cans of beans! I made some oven baked tortilla chips to go with them. Added some shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream to chili and it was out of this world good!!!!!

We made this according to the given recipie and found it to need more spices.  Also the flavor of the lime gave it a really stong after taste.  It kinda ruined it for us.  I would say if you are going to make this, up the ante on the spices and leave out the lime, or just but in about a teaspoon of juice and no rind!

I have made it three times now and never seem to be able to keep leftovers because it goes so quickly.  Everybody loves it and I have even had special requests for it.  I don't follow the recipe exactly because I add a little more of a lot of things.  The last time I made it I used ground turkey and a sun-dried tomato chicken sausage instead of chicken...it was great!  It is a good recipe to experiment with.

I shouldn't rate this recipe since I omitted so many things from it, it's not the same soup!  I used the packaged white beans that I soaked overnight and didn't add any of the tomatoes or chiles just because I didn't feel like that flavor base for the bean soup that day.  Added more garlic than called for too.  Turned out great in my opinion and hubby and I had seconds.  I love love love beans and love to try new soups that call for them.

Yummy!  This was delicious.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  I took various recommendations and pureed one can of the beans and added approximately 1/4 cup of cream cheese to the soup.  Served it with some cornbread and this was a house favorite!

I have been very sick and was finally craving food, barely. This fit the bill. I subbed corn from a can and changed a couple of things around, but kept the essence of the recipe. Thank you.

Great Recipe but I agree with those who were concerned with the thickness.  I cubed the chicken, (and leftover Thanksgiving Turkey), dredged it in flour, salt and pepper then browned it. This method provides the thickness everyone is looking for.  Then I eliminated the tomatoes and added half and half canned diced Ortegas and canned diced Jalapenos, (perfect for me, but probably should be three-fourths to one-fourth Ortegas to Jalapenos for my kids & wife), and finally a 7 ounce can of Herdez Salsa Verde.  Savory and spicy, I have been looking for this recipe for awhile now.  Great post, thanks!

I was not at all impressed with this recipe!  I thought from reading the reviews this would be amazing but it was not.  I followed the recipe to the letter but it just was not as flavorful as I thought it would be, it was more soupy with less flavor.  I ended up throwing it all out as no one liked it.

I liked it, but my husband just thought it was okay.  He doesn't like soups, and this was more like soup than chili.

This is excellent!  I baked the chicken with the brown sugar/chili powder paste that was suggested earlier and shredded it.  Delicious!  I added a jalepino just for extra spiciness, very good with a kick!

I made this using leftover thanksgiving turkey, used only diced tomatoes.  I used 2 cans of white beans and 1 can of corn.  Didn't have coriander or lime so omitted those.  It was still great!!

My husband and I love this, though I had to change a few things, it is very hard to find tomatillos where I live and a lot of the can and jar sizes are different around here. So I substitute the tomatillos and the tomatoes for 2 cans of chili spiced tomatoes.

I used a roasted chicken from the market and pretty much followed the recipe. It was a hit! I used the recommended toppings - sour cream, cilantro, avocado, sharp cheddar cheese, lime and tortilla chips. Yum, yum!

I have made this a couple times now and really enjoy it--a great use for leftover chicken, although I'll cook chicken just so I can make this. Next time I want to add some heat--with the tomatoes and tomatillos the primary flavor is one of sweetness, and I want a little something to balance that out. I'll need to get a lime, too, as I haven't tried it with that. I like it with cilantro. Easy (with frozen corn), quick, good.

The best soup recipe I've ever had. I have probably made it 20 times in the last year and always have to provide the recipe to friends. It freezes well and it's just delicious year round. It's best in the summer using fresh corn. Yummy!

I love soups and this is a good one. I used salsa verde instead of tomatillos, and add a fresh tomato in addition to the canned diced tomatoes (my husband doesn’t love canned tomatoes). Great crockpot meal!

We made this soup for our Super Bowl Party. The soup was excellent, very flavorful and was easy to make. However we had a big group of family over and everyone brought dips & chips & jalapeño poppers & much much more so unfortunately our soup was barely touched. But it was also excellent for seconds!

This recipe is incredible. I followed the recipe exactly, even using canned tomatillos which WERE hard to find, but worth it! Using tomatillos instead of using salsa verde which was recommended by many reviewers, created a very mild chili that all my kids liked. I’m not sure the flavor would be the same using salsa either. My husband and I prefer some kick, so we just added hot sauce to our individual bowls. I used leftover grilled chicken and it is to die for!!! I would give this 6 stars if I could! I made this just a week and a half ago and I just bought more ingredients so I can make it again! YUM!

I used what I had on hand.  Doubled the recipe.  Used 2 cups vegetable broth and 2 cups chicken broth. No coriander, so I used 4 teaspoons cumin.  Used 1 can Rotel and two cans diced tomatoes. I had a can of green enchilada sauce and used that for the entire recipe.  Only one onion for the doubled recipe.  One can northern white beans and one can garbanzo beans. Pretty good for improvising.  Next time I’ll use all ingredients as listed except I’ll use salsa verde as suggested by others.

Great recipe! I put lime, sour cream and cilantro on it but it still lacked the zing of chili for me so next time I'll probably just hit it with some Surracha Hot Sauce or some chili powder.
The canned green chili's I used were "mild" but I was expecting more punch from them. I like using real chili's instead of the seasoning though.

This became a family favorite recipe the first time that I made it the only substitutions that I made was one can of yellow corn instead of using two ears of fresh corn and I like to buy an already roasted chicken at the grocery store and then I shred that into a nice size chunks into the chili

Initially, I thought the recipe seemed too simple and probably would be bland. However, I made it anyway. It turned out very good after I added some chili powder and smoked paprika and boosted the amounts of oregano and cumin (all, to taste). I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, which I cut into small pieces and browned with the onion/garlic sauté before adding the other ingredients.

Excellent flavor and made a big pot that lasted for several meals!!  I did cut chili spice to 2 Tbsp because I used hot salsa and wasn't sure how spicy it would be, but next time will up to 2 1/2 or 3 as called for.

This was easy and delicious.  Of course, ingredients can be changed out.  I added a diced sweet potato for more nutrition.  We did not have tomatillos so stuck with diced tomatoes.  Will make again during the winter here in New England.

Absolutely delicious! I read quite a few reviews and used their advice. I did use rotisserie chicken, which gave it added flavor from the spices.  I used 2 cans of white beans, as I wanted more beans. I put this on low in the crockpot for 6 hours.  I used more broth,  hoping I would have leftovers. Not the case. Everyone went back for seconds. I served it with sides of shredded cheese, sour cream, avocado and cilantro. Crusty bread was a nice compliment as well. Thank you for a great recipe!

I love this thank you for posting it. I had hot tomatillo salsa  so used that instead of green chilis and tomatillos and added an extra can of beans.  I think it would be good if made as written but wanted to use what I had.  Will make again soon

This is quick to make and very yummy. It had some unusual ingredients (tomatillos, cannellini beans) that I didn't have on had, so I intend to keep them in the cupboard. May have to use frozen corn rather than fresh as it's almost the end of fresh corn season.

We liked it very much! Easy to make, light but tasty. I used canned corn as that’s what I had on hand, and shredded rotisserie chicken. I left out the cumin but added chili powder. I will make this often this winter.

I made the recipe exactly as is but substituted fresh tomatillos for canned.  I expected to love it because it is one of the very few 5 star reviewed recipes All Recipes has but have to save I was quite disappointed.  Simply put, it just seemed like something was missing.  It tastes predominately like diced green chilis and lacked much depth of taste.  Maybe more beans would help or not draining the beans before adding, not sure.  More spices?  Just seemed like all I tasted was green chilis (which I love) so maybe it should be renamed Green Chilis Chicken Chili?

great recipe! Taste was perfect.  I did use mild ingredients  because I can't handle too spicy. This is something I'll make again. It's so easy to put together and I have enough to put some in the freezer.
Served it with some shredded cheese and flour tortillas.

I absolutely love this chili. I used a rotisserie chicken, 2 cans of great northern beans, 2 cans of corn, 3 cans of chicken broth, instead of tomatillos I used  jar of salsa verde, I used 2 cans of rotel diced tomatoes with green Chilis in it as well as 3 ounces of green chilis and 3/4 tablespoon of cumin. I also sprinkled a 1/2 tsp of “Slap a your Momma” spice on it. Everything else as written. This dish is light and delicious especially 2nd day after the spices start to come together. I recommend this for a cold fall or winter day. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very good so far. This is one of those recipes that allows for a certain amount of creativity. Not having Tomatillos, I went with an extra can of tomatoes and some extra chicken broth. We’ll. See, if it comes out too thin I can add an extra can of beans as well. Stay tuned.

What I REALLY, REALLY love about this recipe is you  don't need anything fresh other than what you probably have on hand.
We have packets of frozen Costco chicken thighs in 1 lb.+ packets as a staple for protein numerous times a week.  Like most everybody we have fresh onions and garlic in the pantry.  Everything else is either staple spices on your shelf or in a can that will be store for years waiting to make this recipe!!!! It's healthy and you can even cook this on a woodstove top while heating your homestead.  I mean ... what else does one need ?What a great recipe to tuck away and use over and over again.  Thanks guys and/or gals.  I love these types of tips.

I doubled the recipe, and it filled my soup pot; probably would serve 6 large bowls with seconds for a couple of people. So probably 6-8 generous bowls.
too spicy for the grands, but adults will like, especially with fresh cilantro!

It was very good. Great taste, but far too spicy. I don't think I'm a total wimp when it comes to spice (I like medium salsa, not mild) but will tone it down next time.

This is my go to recipe for white chili and I feel guilty because it is so easy and tastes great. I use 2-11 oz cans of tomatillos, a 10 oz can of mild green chilis, a can of corn, mexicorn if I have it and  pound of chicken (today I am using chicken thighs).  Seriously try it, so easy and so good. I usually am a from scratch cook hence feeling guilt about using canned stuff but it works!

I used a jar of good tamatillo sauce instead of the pablanos since we didn’t have any in season. I also used canned corn, and drained that, the beans, and chilies. It was good the first day and amazing the next day. Good recipe!

Fantastic recipe, thank you!!! I had to change it up a bit because of things I can't eat:

I added 1 small yellow squash and 1 small zucchini in place of the corn and I added lime juice. I took your advice and added some red pepper flakes. My new favorite go-to!

Like most others here, I deviated from the recipe quite a bit, and the result was pretty tasty. I cooked my own beans (I used small red beans, but I think this would be fine with most kinds of beans), using about 1/2 lb. I used some fresh tomatillos (peeled, rinsed, blanched for 5 minutes, and chopped). The seasoning seemed far too little to get any decent flavor, so I used way more cumin and more oregano. I wasn't sure about the ground coriander (didn't know if I'd end up with something more like curry than chili), but I used some, and it tasted OK.

The recipe leaves out some important details, like what to do with the corn! I think it would be bad to just throw two whole ears of corn in, so I cut the kernels off (I used three ears) and then scraped the cobs to get all the starchy corn juice. This might have helped with thickening--it didn't seem too thin. 

I think this would be fine with more beans and less meat. Oh, and if you use canned beans, you might want to drain them and maybe rinse them.

One of the strangest things I saw in lots of reviews was that this was too spicy, which seems strange, since there is nothing spicy in the recipe at all. If you use something that's not in the recipe (e.g., salsa verde) and then find that the  result is too spicy, you don't get to complain that it's the recipe's fault!

This was fantastic! I did make a few changes, based on other reviewers. I used a jar of verde salsa, canned corn,  2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed with 1/2 cup milk. Served with cheese  and tortilla chips. YUM!

I may have overcooked the chicken so it wasn't as tender as I wanted- To thicken a little I used flour but don't add to much liquid like I did (broth)- it looses all it's flavor OR just add more seasoning --I used one can or rotel and half bottle of red chili sauce and a few NM green chilis and a whole jalapeño --Also I will use navy beans instead of great northern beans

On the family favorite list.! After reading the reviews I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, used canned corn instead of fresh, and salsa verde instead of canned tomatillos. I also fresh diced jalapeno  pepper

I enjoyed this a lot! I used mostly fresh veggies but I'll add the cornstarch like others did next time to make it more chilli like.

It's been our family favorite  for years, ever since finding the recipe here. I make it all different ways, add tomatoes, and sometimes even substitute more veggies and leave out the chicken. But I always start with this recipe. I even call the veggie version, "White Bean Chicken Chili Without the Chicken!" Thank you for the recipe that has become our family tradition!

I followed the recipe.  I didn't use canned Tom at ill's and roasted my own.  It turns out that broiling and pureed the tomatillos made a natural thickener for the soup base.  Can't wait for fresh green chili's.  Absolutely tasty!

I couldn't find tomatillos so I used the second can of diced tomatoes as recommended, and it turned out pretty tomato-y. I had a canned 3-bean mix, and I think that turned out fine. I only had frozen corn, so I put that in before the chicken and beans and returned it to a simmer before adding the last two ingredients. 5 minutes wouldn't be enough with frozen corn. It worked. I may have to figure out how to make it less tomato-y, but it was good overall. I bet the leftovers will be even better once the seasonings really soak into everything else too.

It was super easy to make. I had to make some adjustments to the amount of ingredients, based on the sizes of the cans in my local grocery store. But it still came out flavorful and filling. I will absolutely make it again.

Nice and easy recipe!  We broke apart a whole cooked broasted chicken from the store and followed the rest of the recipe, except we used the verde salsa like most of the reviewers.   I also thickened a bit with a couple tablespoons of corn starch mixed with a half cup chicken stock and added while boiling.   I want to try this again when our store has tomatillos, as I feel they would render this chili more authenticity.  Also, where the chili fell short (because of my lack of tomatillos), I added some jalapenos and included some fresh bay leaves for added flavor dimension.

i changed the recipe a bit

Started by smoking a Spatchcocked chicken, deboned and made broth with the bones, skin and some old veggies from the fridge. Used about a quart of the broth, 2 cans of hot rotel, a 28oz can of tomatillos, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 small onions, a fresh jalapeno,  2 cans of great northern beans and a can of corn. Instead of the seasonings mentioned i used a small can of liquid taco seasoning. Turned out very spicy and delicious. more of a taco soup the way i did it but nobody complained!!

This is probably my favorite dish from AllRecipes.  I have been making it for years.  I can't find tomatillos in my local store, so I leave them out. but otherwise it's a fabulous dish.

I cooked fresh tomatillos which added a wonderful freshness. Kicked it up with chipotle chili powder. Perfect for a single digit temperatures.

Made with the suggestion of salsa verde and fire roasted tomatoes. Family didn’t actually like the addition of corn, so I will omit it next time, but will definitely make this again!

This isn’t my first time making this recipe. It is always comforting and delicious. A great low calorie light  alternative to beef chili. I did take other users advice and substitute the tomatillos for salsa verde and the tomatoes and diced chilies for Rotel. Topped with shredded  Monterey Jack and a dollop of sour cream...you’re sure to be pleased!

Really good. 8 hrs in crock pot. Added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to help thicken, I do recommend that (maybe more), as would have been too soupy without. Used salsa verde instead of tomatillos. Fresh diced jalapeño instead of chilis.

It's delicious and I use pinto beans instead of white beans because that's what I had. I think you could use lots of different ingredients in it would still be good.

This was a big hit with my family. Very good and does not take forever to make it. I did use one substitute. I could not find canned  or fresh tomatillos, so I found a chunky verde salsa - nice chunks of tomatillos in it - used a cup of this in place.  We like it better than the usual texas chili.

was delicious and super easy. Could definitely spice it up a bit. The green chiles are great. You could add more.

It was quite tasty with a little spice to it.  I did add a bit extra cumin and oregano.  I also put in a can of kidney beans and maybe next time will add some black beans to the recipe.

I made this for book club.  I doubled everything except only used about 1 1/2 times the broth (32 oz box), so no thickening needed.  I used diced tomatoes with green chilis, so no need for the can of chilis unless you want to add more spice.  I drained the 2 cans of beans and used about 1 1/2 cans of Niblets corn.   Offered small bowls of cilantro, sour cream and shredded cheddar.  Adding a dollop of sour cream and stirring it in each bowl really added richness and creaminess.  I lightly salted during cooking so everyone could salt as they desired.  

Everyone raved and my family is asking for it again days later.  It went fast, so no pictures!

Love this recipe!  I made exactly as written except I may have added a bit more chicken. I used fresh oregano and added Roma tomato out of the garden. We cooked it over a campfire in a cast iron Dutch oven and allowed to simmer an hour and a half. No need to thicken. It was absolutely delicious and very filling.  It will be a go to recipe for sure.

Easy and quick, healthy, and tastes good.  I made this with the extra can of beans and  additional chicken, but no added peppers and it was spicy enough - especially for my son who took it to lunch this week and really liked it.  I will keep it in the rotation.

I used a can of corn which was a lot of corn in proportion to the other ingredients but I like corn so it didn’t ruin the dish.  I added a dash of lemon juice and red chili paste and served with a dollap of sour cream.  It was really good and will definitely make again!

A new favorite. I used taco seasoned ground chicken in place of the diced cooked chicken. This added lots of flavor. Also substituted salsa verde for the tomatillos as others have noted in their reviews. Used a bag of frozen corn in place of the fresh ears.

This was truly delicious...the only thing I changed, was I used a can of Rotel mild and a can of diced low salt tomatoes since I did not have green chilis.....my husband loved it and so did I....you can also add pasta to this and some fresh parm cheese and it is to die for!

I added one jalapeno, some salsa verde in place of the can of chilis, and used 1 can of corn rather than fresh. I added a can of black beans along with the white beans. I cooked diced chicken breast along with the onion and peppers and garlic before adding all of the canned ingredients and cooking longer. It was delicious!

When using dry spices, they taste better when added in with the onion and garlic toward the last minute of cooking.

 I also found substituting salsa verde  for canned tomatillo & green chili was a good choice... and a quick supermarket pick.

Loved it, very tasty.  I cannot eat corn, so I omitted it, but I added other beans (black, garbanzo) that I had available.  I’ve made this a few times, and have started using Rotel (or similar) as an easy substitute for the diced tomatoes and chilis. And...this can be made very easily and quickly in an Instant Pot.

This turned out more like a stew than a chili, too soupy/watery. I had to add corn starch to give it some body. Shredded chicken may have helped the texture, but mine was cubed. Bottom line though, it was rather flavorless. I added lots more and different seasonings and spices trying to round out the flavor, and make it more appealing. In terms of nutrition I think it's a lean healthy recipe, just not very exciting.

I love making this with ground turkey instead of the chicken. I also add a can of black beans for some added protein. I use a jar of Herdez mild salsa Verde instead of the tomatillos. So easy and delicious! My whole family loves this. I've made this at least 20 times. I used my insta pot tonight to make it and it turned out great. Also freezes nice if you have leftovers.

I doubled the recipe & added black beans, jalapeños in place half of the chiles,used frozen corn, a tablespoon of crushed red pepper & some corn starch to help thicken it up a little. I also opted not to add the tomatillos.Took it for a chili cook-off at work & won!

I love this chili! I used 2 lbs of ground chicken only. Cooked it with onion and garlic. Substituted salsa verde for the tomatillos and added a teaspoon of chili powder. Thickened it with corn starch. Yum. Thanks for recipe to use as a template! The taste is awesome!

I took a cue from almost every review by adding salsa verde instead of tomatillos. I also boosted the cumin to about a tsp (I don’t really measure stuff). It was more of a soup than a chili as far as consistency, but overall it was a wonderful dish. I used fire roasted tomatoes which added a nice flavor. I also used a slow cooker. I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker while I cooked the chicken. Once the chicken was finished I chopped it up and dumped it in the slow cooker. Very good! Pretty healthy! I highly recommend this on a cold day.

Yuuummy! First of all, I made it with all fresh ingredients, I find it is always better for taste and health reasons, and second, following the reviewers' advice, I added salsa verde (also because I didn't have tomatillos available) and the 2 cornstarch Tbps. Also I just had frozen corn, so that worked nicely. 
I'll so be making this over and over!

I changed it up completely...  I make a double batch because I love leftovers...  I add canned sliced jalapenos, canned pinto, kidney, and black beans.  I use avocado, sour cream and tortilla strips/chips and Tapatio to make it more like a chicken tortilla soup...

Love this recipe! This is the third time I’ve made it. I use rotisserie chicken breast from Sam’s Club. I’ll have to try the Chile Verde tomatoes next time. My husband and I really love this recipe.

Like others, I used a mild salsa verde instead of tomatillos. I also used white chili beans that were already seasoned and garnished with shredded cheese. It was delicious! Just the right amount of spice. It would even be good if you made a vegetarian version.

I made this chili when I had weekend guests.  They loved it served with cornbread muffins.  I froze the leftovers for a quick family dinner later.   It freezes well!

No where could I find canned tomatillos. I bought fresh tomatillos and after removing the paper like skin, boiled them for 4 mins, cooled them and chopped them. I also added half a jar of green jalapeño salsa. I also added a little cornstarch that had been mixed with a little cold water to thicken it a bit. Overall a tasty recipe.

What I really like is recipes that don't have to be adjusted, but this one needed to be to suit my taste. I guess it was a pretty good starting point. I made it as is for lunch and we were unimpressed. I added a second can of white beans, more cumin and a dose of chili powder and it was really good by suppertime!

Hard to rate bc I left out all the "spice". I just made it and tasted it and when we sit down for dinner my husband and I will add the salsa verde and possibly jalapeños. But this way the kids can enjoy it too. Planning on serving it with tortilla chips & sliced avocados

We are vegan/vegetarian so, I substituted vegan chicken for chicken; vegetable broth for chicken broth and added fresh tomatillos instead of canned. It is delicious! I can't wait to share.

This was uber good.  I made a few changes.  I had a few thawed chicken breasts so I cubed them and sautee'd them with the onions,  fresh tomatillo's and a couple of fresh jalapeno's.  I also added a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce to make it more chili and less soup like.  I grow cilantro and oregano on my windowsill so I clipped a bunch of that and tossed it in!  I served it with mozzerella cheese shredded in the bottom of the bowls with tortilla chips and sliced avocado on top.

UPDATE 10/26/17: Made this in a slow cooker! Threw onion and garlic with some olive oil in a 2C Pyrex measuring cup and "sauteed" till slightly soft in the microwave (approx 1.5-2 min in 30 second intervals). Used leftover roast chicken and 28oz can of petite diced tomato (immersion blended some), plus added a can of black beans. Put all ingredients in the slow cooker, and added more of the spices to taste. Cooked on High for a few hours. Easy and yummy on a cool fall day.

This recipe is delicious, used can rotel, can green chilis, bag frozen corn, drained can great northern beans and large can ranch style beans with jalapeños. Started with box and a half chicken broth. I didn't use any onion because my husband doesn't like. I put 3 chicken breasts in broth and added other ingredients. Later I pulled chicken out and forked it apart. The spices listed were perfect but I didn't have Coriander so I used dried cilantro and added chili powder like others suggested. I like the 3 tbsp corn starch and 1/2 cup milk suggestion and added these. I threw in a bunch of fresh uncut jalapeños to top and the guys eat them w/ their soup.

I have never made a white bean chili, but this looked good so I tried it to offer to guests as an alternative to the red chili I was making for game day, which was on the hot side.  I absolutely loved this, and may just begin making this instead from now on!  

I couldn't find canned tomatillos, but substituted a jar of green tomatillo sauce and used it instead. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as is.  Delicious!   Great flavor, with a little kick but not too much. 

Along with other chili toppings, I had a can of Jardine's Sweet N Spicy Corn (from Wal-Mart) available.  A few tablespoons of that  mixed in the chili made it absolutely perfect.    

Thanks for the recipe!

I make this all the time for large parties at work or large parties at my home.  Everyone is totally in LOVE with it!   I believe one of the most special ingredients is the Salsa Tomatillo by Frontera( I get at Publix in FL) that I use instead of fresh tomatillos.  I read a prior review that suggested this and it really seems to be the special ingredient!  It is very easy to make and pretty inexpensive ,especially if you are making for a large group of people!! ??

This was absolutely delicious...my family loved it! Did make a few substitutions, based on reviews I used salsa verde rather than tomatillos and fire roasted tomatoes. Also used fresh green chiles to up the spice factor and added bell pepper too. So good, this will be a regular in my house.

I recommend smashing 1/2 the white beans to add texture and thickness to the soup. Most white bean shill recipes call for this. I also browned chicken after onion and garlic.

I made with mild Rotel, in place of tomatoes and chili's. I also used fresh tomatillas. , Diced.  Put in a pressure cooker, 15 psi for 8 minutes. Let it sit for 15 minutes. Tasted like it had been cooking all day. Definitely repeating this dish!

Used my own canned salsa Verde instead of the tomatoes.  I did drain the cans of liquid setting it aside in case it was too thick without,  but it was the perfect consistency.I think this has now turned into my favorite soup/chile.  Was not too runny as others claimed.  Was nice and thick like chile is suppose to be.  Next time I make it, I will not change a thing. We did add tortilla chips as a topping.  Thank you for submitting it.

I thought it was pretty simple and yet very tasty.  I had minor modifications, and added a little more of each spice, and chicken broth cuz I had more chicken breast than called for.  Yum!

Excellent!  Wouldn't change the recipe at all!  I only had 1 lb of ground turkey on hand, but it worked well.  I have never cooked with tomatillos before and quickly realized how great they taste!

I wanted a recipe using a can of tomatillos and this was just the right starting point! I had all the ingredients, and made a few changes to suit us. I had frozen chicken breast and after browning only half the onion And twice the garlic I put in the broth and cooked the chicken. Then I cut it up and added the veggies and beans plus a couple of potatoes. I did not bother cutting the tomatillos, they fell apart nicely with the tomatoes. I did add 2 cups of water, a chicken buillion cube, a tsp. of sugar and crushed fennel seed and a jalepeno. A pinch of baking soda to reduce the acidity. I cooked it for about an hour and a half on low heat. Delicious! Thanks for the basics to put together!

I cannot give this enough stars. It's incredibly easy and insanely good. I've made it a few times now and every time, people have raved about it and asked for the recipe! 

I make it even easier than written by 1) buying a cooked rotisserie chicken and shredding the meat to use in this dish (one average-size chicken is the perfect amount of meat); 2) using one 16 oz can of corn instead of fresh; and 3) as other reviewers have said, using a jar of salsa verde in place of the tomatillos. I use Trader Joe's salsa verde, which is only about $1.75, and one whole jar is the perfect amount for this recipe. 

Seriously, go make this. It's awesome. You can serve it with sliced avocado and/or sour cream and/or cheese and/or tortilla chips, which just up the awesomeness factor even further, but it's also delicious by itself, perfectly fine without any garnish.

This chili/soup recipe was not only delicious, but it is a very healthy recipe and super easy to make.  I used canned chicken and canned corn, and my whole family devoured it.  ALSO, since I used all canned goods, I had everything bought and was able to throw it all together in a hurry.   I threw it in the crock pot and let it cook a for a couple of hours on low.

Yum! I cooked boneless skinless chicken thighs in the 2 cans chicken broth with the sauteed onion and garlic. Then cooled and shredded. Added back with 2 cans rotel, 2 cans cannelini beans, 7 oz fire roasted chili's, 24 oz Archer Farm tomatillo salsa Verde, 1 can corn, 2 tsp cumin,1tsp coriander. Chopped in 2 jalapeños.  A lot of volume so I did not thicken.  Really enjoyed it!

Followed recipe fairly closely, but used fresh roast poblanos and roasted tomatoes for more flavor.   Also used Mexican oregano, more chicken broth, and white beans w/onion, garlic, chili spices and mild jalapenos in sauce.  I believe each gave the chili a bit more flavor which my guest loved!!
Had 2 requests for this recipe, so will pass it along...............
Thank you Thea!

I used low sodium chicken broth, eliminated the canned tomatillos, and used green enchilada sauce, as was recommended by some of the reviewers. I also used canned diced tomatoes with chili and lime. Aw, man, was this ever good. It was good right away, and even better the second day.

I coated the raw chicken cubes with spices and cooked them in coconut oil.  Used a quart of fresh chicken broth and a quart of home canned white beans.  Added cayenne pepper and a minced fresh jalapeño pepper.  Served with brown rice. Yummy!

Wonderful!!!! Used canned Salsa Verde instead of tomatillos, which gave it just enough kick for wimpy Minnesotans, then added hotter green sauce at the table to mine. Have learned that, like salt, hot sauce added at the table allows individual variation without risking the whole batch.

A delicious winter meal!  I had wanted to try a white bean chili for some time and absolutely loved this recipe. I followed other advice and used tomoatos with green chilies, I added the corn starch, some chili powder, canned corn, a sprinkle of sugar to counteract the acidity and used the green salsa instead of tomatillos... It was incredibly delicious and not quite as rich as a traditional red chili which was refreshing and nice. I topped it off with generous toppings of cheddar and sour cream and my husband and I enjoyed every bite!!! I will definitely make this again, thank you!

Very easy to make and tastes great!!! I had to sub salsa Verde for the tomatillos because Publix didn't have any. Very good, just enough heat to let you know you are eating chili.

Really good recipe.  I ended up using green salsa verde (Mrs. Renfros) as I couldn't find canned tomatillos.  It did add great flavor, but I made the mistake of using "Hot" and dumping the entire jar in--way too hot!  My bad!  Will definitely make again, but limit the amount of salsa verde unless it's mild!  I also used two cans diced tomatoes with chilies.  This was a thinner consistency but I think it makes just as good a soup as a chili!

This is more of a soup than a chili, even after I doubled the beans and added cornstarch as suggested by others, but still very good.

This was so delicious - very flavorful and the chilis added just the right amount of heat.  I couldn't find canned tomatillos so I used 1-1/4# fresh.  I husked them, put them in a pan, covered them with water and boiled them for 10 minutes, then put them in the blender and processed them to a thick liquid.
NOTE:  fresh tomatillos can be bitter, so USE BAKING SODA TO CUT THE BITTERNESS OF FRESH TOMATILLOS  After adding the tomatillos to the broth, add baking soda, a little at a time  and wait until it stops fizzling.  Add more soda as needed until bitterness is gone. The soda will not change the flavor or be detectable in any way.
My husband LOVES celery, so I added 3 ribs, chopped, and it added  both color and flavor  but is entirely optional.

Very Good! Husband loved it! I took the advice of other reviewers to add 3 Tbs of cornstarch and added two cans of beans, used one can of corn instead of the 2 ears of corn. I will definitely  make this again!

Made it exactly like the recipe, but I didn't have any coriander, still turned out great. I thought it was to thick so I added more broth. It also didn't have enough beans for me, so I added more. Even though I added more of the listed items I didn't really change the recipe like most people do. This recipe is great just the way it is, just adjust to your desired thickness.

This was a great recipe. It was perfect for a cold rainy day in Georgia! I did make a few changes though. 

I used a combination of baked boneless skinless breast and boneless skinless thighs. I replaced the tomatillos with salsa verde. I omitted the corn and added Poblano peppers for a small kick. 
 I only used half the amount of chicken broth and added a few teaspoons of cornstarch. 

After simmering the vegetables, peppers, and sauces, I threw everything in a crockpot. 
 
It came out better than I expected!
 I definitely will make again!

This was delicious!  It was medium spicy and had such great taste....will definitely make again.  I used a store bought already broasted chicken, removed the skin, and cut up.  I also used all the juices from all the canned goods, and used ground coriander, instead of seed.  Thanks for a tasty dish.

I'm making this again because it was so good the first time. I'm a vegetarian so I subbed Wegman's "Don't be Chicken" strips for the chicken breast.  I used salsa verde instead of tomatillos and I don't think I had any coriander seeds but it still came out amazing.

We loved it but we made some changes to personalize. First we used 2 cans Rotel with chilies instead of separate cans of tomatoes and chilies. Like many we added 2-3 more cans of beans. We've also  combined with white kidney which worked well. We used salsa verde instead of tomatillos as seen in one review. Left out the corn because bf doesn't like it. I make it on the side  and add only to mine. We garnish with cilantro and eat with plenty of sour cream and On The Border Tortilla Chips because that's the only tortilla chip we eat!

Love this recipe--it's our go-to rainy day meal!

My first time making chicken chili and this was amazing! the pot is almost gone and they are asking me to make it again tomorrow. I substituted the corn with carrots (because of a corn allergy). I also used salsa Verde because I couldn't find tomatillos. I'm definitely saving this recipe. Thank you!

I made this more than once without tweaking it but it has become such a staple in the winter that I have created my own version. I tend to buy canned diced tomatoes that already have green chilies in them and omit the can of green chilies. I buy low or no sodium everything and the taste does not suffer.

We loved this recipe. We followed the recipe however we did about 4 oz. less of the tomatillos, added at least 5 cloves more cloves of garlic, an 1 oz more of the Green Chilies - Haute Hot to be exact, doubled the spices and Todd it with white aged cheddar, avocado, scallions and habernaro's - amazing and so delicious!!! Highly recommend this recipe. The only thing I will alter the next time is use less sodium chicken broth and Doctor it up.

This is an easy and healthy protein packed comfort food dinner recipe for any time of year.
The only changes I made because of what I usually have in my pantry was  in place of the tomatillos used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 16 oz. jar of homemade canned tomatoes.  Did not use green chilies or fresh garlic, or the corn.  Instead used a T of coarse ground garlic salt with parsley, doubled the oregano, and liberal on the cumin and coriander spices.  Also added another can of cannellini beans for an extra kick of protein and fiber.  
If too spicy a nice side is cottage cheese.  Also the garnish of pepper jack cheese, cheddar or your favorite cheese makes it even yummier tasting.

This was okay done following the recipe.  I tasted it and it was a little bland.  I went ahead and cooked it about 20 minutes more to get more flavor and added more of all the seasonings.   So in the end I about doubled the seasonings, which really is needed.  Topped with some cheese and I think some diced avocado would have been a good addition.

This is now a family favorite. I make it in my slow cooker, by just throwing everything in. I use salsa verde instead of the tomatillos, tomato sauce and whatever beans I have on hand. My kids told me this is their favorite chili.

Very good! Lost of flavor and very easy to put together. I did add the cornstarch as suggested by others and extra spices to my liking.....chili powder, extra cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and so on. Didn't have the tomatillos so I just didn't add them, and instead of green chilies a cup of salsa. Soooo yummy! Will definitely be making this again.  ??

This recipe is really delicious, but you really need to cook it longer than stated. After simmering for the short amount of time it says, you still have that "raw ingredient" taste. However, if you simmer for at least an hour or two the flavors meld and it becomes really good. I sautéed onion and garlic in a little olive oil and then added the rest of the ingredients. I also used salsa verde instead of tomatillos. Garnished with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. Everyone loved it.

Simple to cook and delicious recipe. I ended up boosting the spices by about 50% and added an extra .5 pounds of chicken.

Loved this recipe.  It was so quick and easy.  My daughter and husband loved it as well!  I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the can of beans and chicken broth.  I only used half the can of chiles.  I will be making this again today.  Just loved this recipe.

This was delicious.  Doubled the recipe, only substitution was "My Brother's Salsa Tomatillo" from Walmart because I couldn't find canned tomatillos.  I used one 16 oz. jar for my doubled recipe and it added plenty of flavor. I did squeeze in the juice of one lime.  I recommend the addition of lime juice;  it really gave it some zing.   I also seasoned my chicken heavily when I poached it.   This was taken to a chili potluck..  I made it on the stove the day before, simmered for about an hour and a half, and added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in half a cup of cold water to thicken it a little.  Transferred to slow cooker to take to the potluck.  Everyone must have liked it because it was the first one to go.

Excellent I used two cans of beans  andashed about 1/4-1/3 of them to make the stew thicker.   Added chopped avacado,  chopped cilantro and a squeeze fresh lime juice when serving,  would be good with tofu too

This is a serious major delicious bean soup!  In place of the tomatillos I used a 14oz bottle of salsa verde because my store didn't carry tomatillos. I added 2 cans of drained white beans instead of 1 can, because I love beans. The extra beans and the salsa verde made it a perfect thickness so there was no need to add any cornstarch.   I replaced the fresh corn with half a bag of frozen corn for convenience.  By mistakes I bought a 7oz can of whole green chillis, instead of chopped green chillis. Now I am glad I did because I chopped them myself and the texture was oustanding. Even though I picked the mild green chillis, it still gave the soup some nice spicey heat. With that I suggest you do not get hot ones unless you are a seasoned, conditioned spicey food connesseur. I didn't have left over chicken, so i cubed 2 chicken breasts, lightly spiced it with all the spices in the recipe then sauteed it. I removed it from my cast iron pot, then started the cooking part following the recipe's instructions. Thank you for sharing!

Very good! I stuck with the seasonings and proportions, I only modified based on ingredients I had on hand. I used 1 jar of verde salsa instead of tomatillos and a can of diced tomatoes that contained chiles. Delicious, great recipe!

Added a bit more broth than called for, and used leftover turkey the day after Thanksgiving. I would like a little more heat, so will probably add some jalapeños or chili powder the next time. Still great, though! Devoured by picky hubby and 2 year old alike!

Loved this chili!!! I doctored it up as well. Used all of the suggestions: added corn starch, substituted wit salsa verde and added a jalapeño.
I cooked the chicken in the oven first, threw everything in  crock pot. Added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, sautéed
Mushrooms and zucchini  at end and topped it with sour cream cheddar cheese and fresh avocado. Best chili I've ever had. My husband had 3 bowls!!'

Yummy and easy! I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and mild Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the tomatillos.  I used canned corn and 2 cans of white beans with about a pound and a half of rotisserie chicken chopped up.  I thickened  the chili with a tablespoon and a half of arrowroot .  garnishes are sour cream ,cheddar cheese, chopped onion, salsa and maybe a side of corn bread.

Delicious dinner after a cold day!  I found this on a whim, while shopping in the grocery store, and wish I would've read the reviews, because it definitely could have used 1 more can of beans.  I also substituted salsa verde (couldn't find tomatillos) and the flavor was great.  Will make this one again.

Taste great. Helpful hints for those who want to try this. If you got no chicken buy the cold rotisserie at your local grocery store. It's already cooked and near the deli dept. The other reviews gives you the rest of great examples and garnishes. So no excuses about left over chicken.

Made this for Halloween meal to serve adults while kids had a party in the basement.  It was lovely.  I couldn't find canned tomatillos so I used fresh and sautéed them with the onions and garlic to soften them.  I  like a thicker soup so at the end I put some extra northern beans in the food processor with a little soup broth and added to to the soup.  I served the chili with extras on the side for each person to customize their dish: Fresh cilantro, corn chips and sour cream.  It was fun and delicious.  We had wine and salad and crusty bread to!  YUM!

Great simple recipe! I also substituted salsa verde for the tomatillos, and even if you don't like salsa verde on its own, it adds a nice flavor to the recipe. I also use fresh ingredients where I can, so I used fresh oregano and added fresh cilantro to the mix. Remember that everything is open to interpretation, and you can substitute different things to accommodate your own personal taste. That's what cooking has always been about for me. A recipe is one persons suggestion, and you add and subtract as you like. Love this recipe!

This is a great recipe with a few slight tweaks. I couldn't find canned tomatillos so I bought a tomatillo salsa instead. I used a bag of frozen corn instead of the fresh. I also stir in a container (16 oz.) of sour cream at the end. One last thing I do is add a Tbsp. of brown sugar. It seems weird - but it really works! The brown sugar balances the spicy flavor and gives it depth.

Used green salsa instead of canned tomatillos as other reviews suggested.  Chili had a tangy sweet flavor to it that I did not care for.  Was ok but most likely will not make again.

Even though my husband turned up his nose when I told him what I was making for dinner, he and the kids absolutely loved it and said I could make it again any time I want.  I doubled the recipe, used a whole rotisserie chicken, doubled the cumin, used fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, frozen corn and added a can of hot diced jalapeños.  Served quesadillas with a creamy jalepeno sauce (Taco Bell copy cat recipe) on the side.  I was hoping to have a batch to freeze but my hubby said no way, he is taking it for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a great Sunday afternoon football meal.

I liked this recipe but think I might add a little chili powder next time.  I used all ingredients as listed.  I drained the beans and corn so it wouldn't be too soupy.  I also added 1C of pureed pumpkin...which thickens, adds nutrition, but doesn't change the flavor much.

I enjoyed this... But I did it differently since I don't like chilis..
I used a can of diced tomatoes a can of corn and white beans. I marinated the beans and the tomatoes together and cooked chicken breasts and shred them and put them inside the mixture overnight.

I used chili poweder and a little parsley with the cumin. 
Overall it was a good dish for a cold night

My wife and daughter loved this. Didn't have green chillies so used diced celery with half a dozen drops of Tabasco sauce. Used white kidney beans. Served with grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips and salsa. It's a favourite I'll make again

I've never left a review before but was compelled to do so after making this today.. Fabulous!! Quick and easy to put together too which is always a bonus. I only changed a few things and that's only because I was trying to use what I had on hand. I used chicken thighs that I slow cooked in the crockpot and shredded the meat. I used 2 cans of corn.. I'm certain off the cob would be even better but ahain.. trying to use what I already had. Added 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and a small can of rote diced tomatoes and green chilies. It turned out wonderful especially since the kiddos don't like anything too spicy. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!!

Definitely making this one again! I'd never had "white" chili with diced tomatoes in it before, but this one was spicy and good! A different twist on White Chicken Chili, for sure! When I read that Cumin and Coriander were the primary spices, I was very hopeful, as those are my favorites! Well, they did not disappoint, nor did the diced jalepeno's which gave it a nice, fiery kick in the beak! I didn't follow the measurements, as i never do, but mine turned out just like the picture and like I said, MUCHO tasty-O!!!

Great recipe! We made a few changes, two cans of corn, two cans of beans, a tsp. of  all the spices (except salt), maybe more.. and a whole de-boned rotisserie chicken. There was so much chicken it made the soup very thick so we added more chicken broth- hence more spices. We omitted the green chills because we didn't want it too spicy for kids.. and we did two cans of salsa verde instead of tomatillos. I would have let it simmer more if I had more time but I didn't and it still turned out great! Loved all the condiments…

Loved it.  This is a great place to start.  You can add some kick or chill out as is.

This is absolutely delicious! I was looking for a way to use the fresh tomatillos growing in my garden and came across this recipe. Another site called for a pound of fresh tomatillo in place of an 11 oz of canned. I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 pounds of diced fresh tomatillos in place of the canned. I sautéed diced fresh chicken breast with the onions and garlic. Afterwards, I added the broth, spices, tomatoes and tomatillos just as instructed. I haven't made much with tomatillos and heard that they break down quickly, but mine were still firm- not mushy at all. Since my son will not touch green veggies in soup, I decided to fish out most of them and give them a whirl in my blender. When I added the resulting smooth mixture back to the soup, the blended tomatillos acted as a thickener. So... no cornstarch necessary! I used 2 cans of beans and fresh oregano growing wild in my yard. The soup turned out AMAZING and THICK!!!

I combined suggestions from several recipes and I really loved it but because I was out of salsa, it wasn't as good as it could be. I will be sure not to run out again! I cooked my chicken as another did with celery seed, celery, garlic salt, and salt/pepper.  I used some of this stock with one can broth. I used  more diced tomatoes, two cans beans , diced red pepper with the onion, LOTS of cumin and chili powder,  a dash of cilantro, and thickened with cornstarch.  At serving, a must to top with shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, and sour cream.  All in all it was delicious and if  I had put salsa, I would say a 5!!.

We loved this! I altered it a little according to some of the reviews I read, and others. I used a can of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos and added extra beans. I also used canned corn instead of fresh, and I also added fresh cilantro. I'm a wimp, but I didn't think this was too spicy, and my husband added some red pepper flakes to his for a little extra kick. I didn't think he would be too excited about a chicken chili, but he said multiple times that this was REALLY good chili. It's also pretty healthy, so I'm going to be making a big batch of it to use while I'm on a weight loss challenge this month.

*** Update:
I tried making it again, in the crockpot. DO NOT TRY TO MAKE IT IN THE CROCKPOT. I don't know if it was because I let the garlic stew too much or what, but it was NOT GOOD. I even tried draining the liquid off and redoing it on the stove, but it had soaked into the beans. Will try to try again, but on the stove this time!

We so love this recipe and everyone asks for it! Today I am making it in the slow cooker and the whole house smells yummy; which is inviting as its a cold spring day. At any rate, I always get canned tomatillos at Wegmans as that is the only store around here, Woodbridge, VA, that has them! I want to try the fresh tomatillos sometime which I think would be good. I use alot more chicken and beans in mine and pretty much double the spices but we like it with a lot of depth! You won't be sorry if you make this believe me its very hearty and delicious! Also we use tortilla strips in ours for a topping! Make it--it's very addictive!!

I did not alter or substitute one thing.  This was a great recipe and we all enjoyed it very much. Great substitute for ground beef chili.

This was good but a little too hot for my husband but that could be because I used Salsa Verde instead of Tomatillos.  It has good flavor though.  Next time, I think I will lesson the amt of Salsa Verde and increase the amount of white beans.

OH MY GOSH.  This is soooo good. You don't need any of the fattening toppings because it is just so darn good and full of flavor.  I can't get the green chilies in England so I subbed some chili flakes.  Otherwise stuck to recipe (except for canned corn).  Have to order tomatillos online but so worth it!

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes. Instead of diced chicken, I just cook up some ground chicken. I enjoy it as written, but my husband likes it more spicy, so I added chili powder. He still ends up adding jalapeños to it. I make a big pot of this and we will eat it for days. Sometimes we mix different types of beans too. It is great the next day.

Oh man, this is so good!  I've scrapped my old beef chili recipe; this is the only one I need.  The only changes I made were suggested by other reviewers.  I used good-quality salsa verde and fire-roasted tomatoes; one can of corn, drained; and two cans of white beans, drained.  Served with shredded cheddar and sour cream, with fresh cornbread on the side.  Perfect for these cold winter's days!  Thank you!

I make this for my husband at least once every two weeks! I switched out regular diced tomatoes for petite diced, took out the tomatillos and added 4 oz of salsa verde! I only fix it that way now. I have made this for countless number of people and everyone says how great it is!

Quick, easy, and delicious recipe. I added curry leaves to this just because I had some I needed to use. This produced a nice smokey flavor. I also sautéed the onion with the spices instead of putting them in later.

Absolutely loved it! I was really pressed for time so I used an already cooked rotisserie chicken and it was delicious. I made the few changes suggested by others and it was very tasty! My husband had 2 helpings! It was too spicy for my twins, but it was perfect for me and my husband. This will be something I will definitely make again! I didn't have cornstarch so I put some flour in a cup, mixed with some water than added to the soup while still simmering and this helped thicken it up. Highly recommend!

Hubby gave this 5 stars and would have given it more if he could have.  We shredded the chicken breast and as others suggested used a good salsa verde instead of tomatillos.  I let it simmer for a while with the cover off and it thickened up nicely.  Didn't have coriander seed so used ground fennel.

Very tasty.  Spiced it up a bit with chili powder.  Also used a jar of Salsa verde instead of tomatillos.  I boiled chicken thighs and used the broth.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made this several times.  Absolutely love it. If you are substituting salsa verde for the tomatillos, be careful.  Some salsa verde's could be too spicy for those who do not like too much spice. You can either use green enchilada sauce or a can of Rotel (I use mild) in place of tomatillos.  Great recipe. Thank you

I'm not one for spicy but this was awesome. I also used verde salsa instead of tomatillos and used 2 cans of beans. I did thicken it with cornstarch per other reviews. So very good and healthy too!

I loved it with my own changes as I don't measure or stick to any recipe. Olive oil, didn't have corriander so I used fresh chopped cilantro as well as oregano but 2 tblsp of oregano, triple the crushed garlic, 2 different chili powders and paprika, 1/4 cup chili paste, 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies because my husband is not a big tomato fan, 2 cans white cannelli beans and 1 can white hominy. To thicken I added some masa

A crowd pleaser every time! It's also diabetic friendly with a few simple variations like low sodium broth, fresh diced tomatoes and rinsed beans, it's loaded with flavor. After making several batches over two years, I like to tweek it with fresh tomatillos, 1 tsp fennel seed and three shakes of chipotle chili pepper seasoning instead of a green chili. The chipotle seasoning gives it a smooth mildly spicy kick, just right! A must to garnish with tortilla strips, a sprinkle of shredded cheese and be sure to put a dollop of sour cream on top to give the soup a slight creaminess as it's eaten. Whoa!!

Loved it!  Made it almost a year ago and finally put it back into the rotation - tonight, in fact!  I've missed it, it was so good!  I brought it to a Super Bowl party last year and I was asked several times for the recipe.  I used both canned tomatillos AND salsa verde as well as canned corn.  I used a little corn starch as well.  I want to add more than one can of beans but my husband isn't a fan.  He wanted me to make this without beans but I said no way - it's too good the way it is!  Anyway, I'd like to add more veggies...maybe I'll sautee a little orange pepper next time for varied color.  YUM.  Shredded cheese on top is a must...oh, and I also added canned jalepeno instead of chiles this time.  Enjoy!

Everyone, including kiddos, loved it! I added another can of beans to make it go farther, but that's the only thing  I changed. I've never used tomatillos before, but everyone still loved it.

I was low on chicken and completely forgot to get the tomatillos so had to make a few tweaks.  I used fresh tomatoes and frozen corn, skipped the sautéing step and just put everything in the pot to cook.  Added green pepper, green onion, and the tail end of a jar of regular salsa.  Since I had very little meat, I added a can of black beans in addition to the white beans.  Next time I would mash the white beans to thicken the soup and then leave the black beans whole.  Served with sour cream and cheese.  The kiddos loved it and are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

Amazing recipe! I used the salsa verde instead of tomatillos and used canned corn. I also increased the cumin to 1 tsp and instead of the cornstarch to thicken, I just mashed some of the beans before adding it. It was delicious!

I followed Mamaspice's changes.  The BF said this was delicious.  That's his best rating.  Very flavorful and hearty.  Love the idea of a chicken chili without all the fat from using cream.

We make a similiar chili but add chili powder and cayenne. We also mash a can of drained but unrinsed white kidney beans and add it to the chili to thicken it. This chili can be as spicy as you want.  Serve with sour cream and cheese buns!  So yummy!

This was really tasty with a bite but not too spicy.  I took the advice of substituting salsa verde in place of tomatillos.  This thickened the soup.  This is a healthy chili that tastes great.  I will make this again.

I loved this chili! I followed the other reviewers with the Target salsa verde, all the rest remained the same. Excellent for a cold evening! Love the slight heat! I used a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own, tasted great!

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was a hit.  I didn't add the ground coriander seed because I didn't have any. I used diced tomatoes w/chiles as I didn't have the tomatillos or the can of green chiles. This recipe is a keeper. The only thing that I'd like to add is that I think the 8-10 servings that the recipe says it makes is way off.  I made a double batch as it made no sense to me that a recipe with only 1 can of beans and 2 cans of tomatoes could feed that many people. My double batch was the perfect amount for 5 people, with 2 of those 5 eating two bowls of chili.

Excellent recipe; I have also added a few different ingredients (even though this is great as is)I took from my other favorite chicken chili recipe,I add a block of "jalapeno pepper Monterrey Jack cheese" it's sold in a block. Slice it thin so it melts easier. Instead of the seasonings in this recipe, I use a packet of  enchilada seasoning mix 1/2 package save the other half for your next chili batch.(of which there will be many of:) It has all of the spices that is called for in this recipe) Some use the full package; I think it's too much(my opinion)I also add 2 cans of rinsed black beans, adds to the taste and color. Instead of the tomatillos I also use just a regular jar of salsa. I toss everything into a crock pot for a couple of hours, when the cheese has melted it should be about done!

This was a HUGE hit with my husband and sons.  I substituted a can of corn for the ears and salsa verde for the tomatillos.  I also added 2 tablespoons cornstarch as recommended in another review.  This definitely helped to thicken the chili.  Finished it with a bit of white pepper and salt.  I also mixed in  some whole wheat rotini pasta....delish!

It's amazing how much everyone can eat when they are eating this. It's easier to find fresh tomatillos here, so I dip them in olive oil and cover with salt and roast them prior to starting the chili. It makes a big difference if you have the time.

Here is the easiest way to make this chili - Put desired number of chicken breasts (I use about 3) in slow cooker with enough chicken broth to keep it moist. When it's about 1/2 - 3/4 cooked, discard broth and shred or cube chicken. Add: 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can white chili beans, 1 jar salsa verde, throw in as much frozen corn as you like, and you're done. 

The salsa verde takes care of all the seasoning, tomatillos and green chilis. Just be careful to buy mild or medium salsa verde. Too hot and your tongue will be on fire. I also put in a corn starch/water rue to thicken the base.

This a great way to use the leftover rotisserie chicken. Plus it is delicious. I also added a jar of salsa verde, a can of corn, and thickened with corn tortillas. I froze half of this and a week later it was still sooo good!

This family loves this recipe.  I have never left a comment for any recipe but this one was worth my time.  I had to substitute the Tomatillo cans since I could not find any where I live.  I was able to find Tomatillo Salsa.  I used a jar of 430ml and it was great.  We cook on Sunday's for the week and my daughter came over and took some with her for lunch.  She did not taste it till she consumed it for lunch.  I received a text telling me how good this was.  I gave this recipe 5 stars since we have made this recipe over and over again.  Thanks Thea for this wonderful recipe.

This was awesome! I had about a pound of dry canellini beans that I had been soaking overnight and needed a recipe so I tried this. Otherwise, I pretty much went with the recipe as written, except that I added a 2nd can of chicken broth and added some ground cayenne pepper, and used fresh tomatillos as our local grocery doesn't carry canned. Of course, since I was using soaked beans, I cooked it longer. SCRUMPTIOUS! It was nice and thick and satisfying. Very healthy too. I actually forgot to put in the corn, but I didn't miss it. I'll try to get it in next time!

Prepped everything the night before.  When dicing onions and chopping garlic ahead of time, remember to roll them in paper towels and wring out if necessary before putting them to oil in the dutch oven.  From start to finish when pre-prepped, 30 minutes for well simmered, well blended, wonderful aroma chili!  My husband is ecstatic and so am I.  Even better a day later.

I'm giving this only 4 as it was written.  I found it to be a little bland for my taste, so I added about 2 tbsp of chili powder, extra garlic and cumin, 2 minced jalapenos, 1 chopped poblano (roasted and skinned), and some fresh cilantro.  Like a lot of other reviewers, I used a jar of salsa verde in place of the tomatillos.  Also, I used a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes.  This is a wonderful base recipe for tweeking to your own taste!

Awesome recipe!  I added the salsa verde and corn starch, which really made it great.  I also added a few black beans since I didn't think one can of white beans were enough.  Highly recommend!

Just got done making a big batch of chicken chili--never realizing that the recipe I'd written down came from here! I always add a few
hot peppers and celery to my saute, use tomatillo salsa, and substitute white and yellow hominy for the fresh corn...but the bones
came from this...As soon as my cornbread is done I'll be enjoying it!

I really expected  great things after reading the reviews. BUT..it was so spicy hot,I couldn't eat it. I added another can each of tomatoes,beans and broth. And only used a 4 oz.can of green chili's(mild) and 16.75 bottle of salsa verde(medium). Perhaps I should have tried to get mild salsa. I will use the recipe again but will maybe find a mils salsa verde. My daughter came over and agreed it was too spicy hot and she opened a can of cream of chicken soup with milk and it looked more like other recipes I've tried.Maybe I'll try adding sour cream to it instead of soup.

Really easy, healthy, and the taste is great.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using the salsa verde ( the green salsa), couldn't find any tomatillos.

It was SO good! I used a small can of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos and green chilis (which I thought was clever until I see so many did the same!)  Added more chicken broth because I was using homemade and wanted to finish it off.  Definitely not thick like chili, more like what I think of as chicken tortilla soup.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream.  DELISH!

This was a very good recipe, but my family were not big fans. My hubby thought it was too tomatoey and didn't have the nice chili flavor of some of the other ones we tried. Sorry, but this one didn't make the cut :/

Glad my store was out of tomatillos!  I made this yesterday but substituted with Salsa Verde (given that, I only used a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies).  I don't like huge corn kernels so I threw in 3/4 can of shoepeg corn, extra beans, extra broth, and extra cumin.  Instead of coriander seeds, I used 1 TB chopped fresh cilantro.  I also used 1/2 can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies.  Won second place with this recipe at a cookoff blind judged by a professional Chef, Restaurant owner, and foodie.  Thanks so much for the inspiration!

Easy and good. I didn't use canned beans i boiled my own. I also didn't find canned tomatillos so I chopped up my own. since corn is out of season i don't like frozen corn on the cob its mush so i did use a can for that however. I baked my chicken in the oven with lime juice and some herbs. good recipe I'll make again. I also like it can easily be made as a meatless monday dish subsitute the broth with vegetable and add some tofu or something.

Made this Sat and I was amazed. I threw all of this in a crock pot and cooked on low for about 8 hours then shredded the chicken breasts and it was sooo very good!!! I had never tried a white chili before so I didnt know what to expect but this will definitly be made again. Only difference was instead of the tomatillo's I threw in 3/4 a jar of Salsa verde and topped it off with sour cream and cheese. Hubby wasnt keen on trying it said it looked weird but tasted great!!! Perfect kick on spices...

This is just ok, it's similar to a chicken tortilla soup recipe I have, but no where near as good. The coriander seed ruined it for me, and otherwise the chili didn't have much flavor. Can't believe this recipe is rated so well.

Big substitution but still great.  In my supermarket, I had trouble finding canned tomatillos.  I have looked in two stores and cannot find them.  Not knowing exactly what tomatillos are like, I decided to experiment and replace with a jar of medium salsa.  The chili is very good with this change.  I wish I could find and try the tomatillos.  Also, I was not sure if white beans are white kidney beans or great northern beans.  Not sure if that makes much of a difference. I would make this recipe again and hope to try it with the tomatillos someday.

Great recipe.  I used the salsa verde in place of the tomatillos and added a second can of diced tomatoes like others suggested.  The chili came out nice and thick.

This was more like a chicken tortilla soup but my family LOVED it! I used fresh tomatillos instead of canned and 1 can of corn instead of fresh. Also I just threw it all in the crock pot. I topped it with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese.

After reading many reviews, I tweaked this recipe a bit and it turned out fabulously! This is my first time cooking with beans (they scare me), but I love this recipe. I substitued a 16ounce jar of mild salsa verde for the tomatillos, used one can of corn instead of fresh, added two cans of rinsed white beans (1 smashed and 1 whole beans), and used 1.5lbs of shredded chicken (boil the chicken, then put in blender with paddle attachment - it's so easy to shred this way). I kept the spices the same and added the ingredients as directed. This produced a nice thick and hearty soup with just the perfect amount of spice and heat. Yum! Will be making this again!

Great recipe!  Like other reviewers, I substituted Salsa Verde for the tomatillos.  Also added about another clove of garlic and an extra 1/4 tsp cumin, but omitted the coriander seed (didn't have any), and used a can of corn (drained) instead of fresh corn.  Let it simmer a bit longer to give a chance for the flavors to blend even more.  Served with cornbread.  Both of my guys - husband and 21 month old son - thoroughly approved!

This recipe turned out very well!  My husband and I liked it and were happy to finish up the leftovers the following day.  I used 1 1/2 cups frozen corn instead of 2 ears fresh corn, and I substituted canned salsa verde for the tomatillos.  My issue with the recipe mirrors that of other reviewers... it is not thick enough to be a chili. If I make this again, I'm planning to bulk it up by adding an extra can of beans or tomatoes (plus a little corn starch, if needed), and I'm also going to find a spicier salsa verde to give it more of a kick.

This is an awesome recipe full of flavor! Other family members don't appreciate spicy chili like I do, so I used 1 cup of salsa verde and added about 2 cups of chicken broth. Also, I used one can of diced tomatoes with chilis and one can of fire roasted tomatoes. This recipe goes in my top shelf.

Delicious!  I followed many of the suggestions from the reviews: added a fresh minced jalapeno, way more garlic than it called for, used La Victoria salsa verde instead of tomatillos, omitted the oregano, added a bay leaf and 1/3 tsp cinnamon, 1 can of corn instead of fresh, and I used 2 cans of white beans.  I messed up on how much broth I put in...way too much, but corrected the mistake by processing batches in my mini food processor then returning to the pot.  Everyone at the party loved it!!  Practically licked the crock-pot clean.  I will be making this again and again.

OMGoodness this is good. I made a few changes to suite my taste: I started with raw, ground white meat chicken, doubled the onions and tomatoes, added a can of pinto beans and salt free corn, substituted salsa verde for tomatillos, added some chili powder and lots of cumin but didn't add oregano and coriander seed. I am a big fan of chili made with beef and this is right up there and so much lower in fat. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!!  I doubled it so I could have left overs for lunch throughout the week.  Only thing I did different was I substituted the chiles and tomatillos for a good salsa.  I don't particularly care for tomatillos.  It turned out fantastically!!

My husband prefers ground beef chilis to chicken chilis, but he really enjoyed this.  In place of the tomatillos and green chiles, I used 1 pt of salsa verde (made with tomatillos and green chiles) that I had put up this summer.  I also used 1 pt of homemade chicken stock, @ 2 cups frozen corn, and 1 pt of diced tomatoes I had canned myself.  I didn't need to add salt or pepper, the seasoning turned out to be just fine.  It's not my favorite white chili, but my husband really loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!  ETA:  My husband singlehandedly ate all of the leftovers and asked me to make more.  He keeps going on and on about what a great recipe this is.  I'll definitely be adding this to our recipe box.  Thanks!

Delicious!! Easy and tasty. Great as it sits, and also great as a launching point for modifications. Very easy to add to and change it up depending on what's in your pantry. Thank you.

I read many reviews.  I loved this!  I used 1lb of rottisserrie chicken.  Add it at the very end or it will shred.  Not bad but no big pieces.   

I used two cans of fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies, one can green Chile’s, 4oz, jar and a half 20oz of tomatillo salsa.  3 teaspoons of cumin, and two cans of white beans.

Yummy!  I edited this recipe a bit though by combining it with another recipe that sounded good.  To this I added one can of condensed cream of chicken soup, a dash of milk, 1/4-1/3 cup of cooking sherry, and a handful of fresh cilantro.  It added depth to the recipe and a lot of nice flavor.  I served it over rice with some Mexican blen cheese and it was awesome!!!

As it always seems I wonder where I was when this recipe was posted. It is excellent! As always I tend to have a few changes to make depending on ingredients on hand. I had fresh tomatillos and jalapenos on hand so I boiled those and cut and diced them into the chili along with the tomatillo juice.  I cooked one of my chickens that I had processed so it took longer to make the dish but the chicken was delicious. I then added them to the onions and garlic. I found with the tomatillo juice that I did not need the additional chicken broth which was good as I was trying to go low sodium.  I then added in one can of corn (not fresh corn season), 1 can roasted and diced tomatoes, 1 can butterbeans (on hand in the pantry-in place of white beans), and all the listed spices. The whole family loved it and it will be definitely be on the regular rotation.

This chili is the best chili I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted an 18 oz bottle of salsa verde for the tomatillos, and I also omitted the coriander seed, because I didn't have any on hand.  It was delicious!!!!!  If you make this, you will not regret it!  5++++++ stars!

My family and I love this recipe. I didn't have all the ingredients...so I left out the cumin, coriander seed, and corn. However, I replaced them with a few items from my cabinet. What a great meal!

My entire house LOVES this recipe! It's a staple in our home in the winter months. I change things every time I make it, depending on my mood. I love to add a splash of lime juice, and a can of black beans. I also use salsa verde most times in place of tomatillos. For spice, go for Mrs. Renfro's Jalapeno salsa, just be careful to taste as you go!

This is an excellent white chicken chili recipe.  I used salsa verde (as others had suggested).  I also shredded the chicken.  Good flavor.  Served with a nice crusty bread and shredded cheese on top!  It's a keeper.

This was very good.  I did not change any ingredients but I did want it thicker.  I pureed about a cup of the beans with some broth, and poured it back it.  Made it on our first snowday of the year, the house smelled great...nice winter meal.

This quick simple recipe was absolutely delicious! Served over rice, topped with cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream, it was a hit for both kids and adults.  I even used canned chicken as a short cut and it was perfect.

Outstanding! I followed the other reviews and used the Salsa Verde, 2 cans of beans, 1 jalapeno, and thickened with the cornstarch. I topped with Cilantro, Sour Cream, and Monterey Jack Cheese. It was fabulous. I can't wait to share with my friends and family.

This was great! I loved it. I followed the exact recipe (except I put it in the crock pot all day), which is something I don't normally do. My kids loved it. Definately will be making again..we always have the ingredients in the house! If my kids weren't eating it too, I would add a jalapeno pepper or two.

Great Recipe! I have made it 3 or 4 times already and I agree with the addition of salsa verde in the mix. I moved a few of the proportions a bit to make a lerger batch (i.e. 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes and 2-3 cans of white or pinto beans). I also add a tablespoon of recaito, a cilantro cooking base after cooking the onions, garlic, and tomatoes. It adds a good flavor.

Love this soup.  I make it several times a year and we eat it for days without getting tired of it.  Instead of tomatillos, I use a big can of verde sauce.  Highly recommended!

This chili was excellent! To cook the chicken, my husband boiled it in enough water to cover the chicken entirely.  Next time, we will make 2 batches so that we can freeze one.

Very good chili. I used the canned tomatillos and was very happy with the result. I will try it with the salsa verde next time just to see what the difference is. Definitely a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe, I got it from a friend about a year ago, and it has become a favorite.  This is not a recipe that if you don't have something you can leave it out, maybe he corn, everything blends so well together that I will only make it if I have everything I need.  SO YUMMY!!!

This was great. Made it for daughter's birthday dinner. Substituted 1/2 bottle (about 8 oz. of 16.7 oz bottle) of La Costena Green Mexican salsa (Salsa Verde) for tomatillos and added extra broth. I could have used extra salsa verde without it being too hot. Otherwise used rest of recipe as it was written.

This was delish!  Like others, I used habanero salsa, diced tomatoes with chilis and skipped the coriander and subbing more cumin.  I also used low sodium stock and topped the chili with sour cream, red onion, lime and cilantro.  Definately a keeper.

This is excellent!  I made it for a church dinner and several people commented that they thought it was hot.  We serve it at home with sour cream, cheddar, and tortilla strips so that cuts down on the "heat" of it.  I substitute a jar of salsa verde for the tomatillos and a bag of frozen corn for the fresh corn.  This is an easy and delicious recipe!

Very good! I used chili-ready tomatoes and added a can of pinto beans and plenty of chili con carne seasoning. I couldn't help feeling that it was missing *something*, but not sure what! Regardless, it was very tasty and filling. Thank you!

My husband challenged me to use everything in my fridge before grocery shopping. I had the main ingredients chicken and beans and the spices. I did not have corn but celery. I had two canned tomatoes and I added chili powder to give it more bang. Also I am not a fan of chicken broth b/c of the sodium so I take one Italian dressing to replace it. Mine was SOOOOOOOO GOOD! Nice to know you can change the minor things in this recipe and still come out with delicious chili! YUM YUM

Excellent.  We steam fresh broccoli and put it in the bottom of the soup bowl and put the soup on top.  What an excellent way to have an all in one meal.  We have made this recipe at least 15 times to date.  It is excellent every time, we double it.

My husband, guests and I loved this soup...(my first ever review here). I used salsa verde,added a heaping teaspoon of smoky paprika and used homemade chicken stock, my only changes to the recipe. Next to my homemade potato soup, this is my favorite soup EVER--and that's saying alot, since soup is my favorite wintertime meal,,,we probably eat some type of soup for dinner at least 5 times a week, and often for lunch too. My favorite toppings were the tortillas and avacados drenched in limejuice..YUMMY. I served it with homemade brioche that was studded with dried mixed fruit and for desert had chocolate pudding (also homemade using Martha Stewart's pudding recipe). I like to combine sweetness with spicy, tart foods,,,just my personal taste though. Everyone raved over the soup and requested the recipe. (I had several toppings for them to choose from--since it was a gathering)  Thanks Thea for this fantastic recipe.

After making this, I changed the name of it to Chicken Tortilla Soup!   I didn't think "Chili" at all.  I bought a rotisserie chicken for this and it made it very fast and easy to make.   I added an extra can of beans and used Salsa Verda.  We topped it with tortilla strips and shredded cheese.  My husband loved it.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and placed 3 frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker and added the rest of the ingredients.  I used tomatoes with chilis instead of tomatillos and the salsa verde.  I did omit the corriander and add the 2 tbl. corn starch.  This was the best crockpot chili I have ever had.  Delicious!

Outstanding.  Don't worry about the green tomatoes or chillies, just use extra diced tomatoes and some chili powder for a great dish.  Used canned corn and some hot peppers instead.  Taco cheese mix and sour cream were wonderful toppings.  Can't imagine it being better.

I thought this was really tasty.  Since we didn't have chicken broth we made some from chicken bullion and it was so good.  Using the bullion made it a little too salty but we fixed it with some extra water.   I wasn't that hungry today and my husband decided that's what he wanted to make.  I ate three bowls.  I couldn't stop. We garnished it with some grated cheese, avocado, sour cream and chips on the side.  Mmmmmm.

Very tasty recipe.  As suggested by other users that couldn't find tomatillos, I also substitued with a jar of Salsa Verde.  I just used a 16.75 oz jar.  I didn't have fresh corn and used 2 ears of frozen corn. I also used 2 cans of white beans instead of one because I like more beans.  I browned ground chicken meat (darK) and used that instead of diced chicken meat.  It was awesome.  I was afraid that this was not going to have any kick to it, but apparently the jar of medium salsa verde sauce had enough kick to it for the whole chili.  It was delicious and easy.

I made this for the first time looking for something warm and different to make. Both my husband and I really liked it!! I did find the canned tomatillos (never had them), and liked those in this. I would probably spice it up just a little; maybe using medium green chilies and a spicier diced tomato. I did top if off with the lime and avocado, which added a good flavor. All in all, it was delicious and will for sure be making this again!!

I sell out of this every time I make it.  When I want an even quicker fix, I buy the freshly baked chicken at the grocery store. Great recipe, thanks very much!

Awesome.  I used tomatillo salsa instead of tomatillos and left out the chilies.  I also used 3 cans of white beans and 1 can of corn.

This was a good dish.  I made a few changes: olive oil rather than vegie oil, more garlic, followed the suggestion to replace tomatillos with salsa verde, and I NEVER measure cumin b/c I love it so I just dump loads in whatever dish calls for it, and I used about 2 cups of frozen kernel corn.  It was easy to make, dresses up nicely with condiments and was truly yummy. Thanks for such a nice and easy dinner in a bowl!

Yummy recipe that I will certainly make again!  I did alter a bit by simmering chicken breasts (including bone)...pulling the cooked chicken (rather than cubed/chunks).  I added 3 cans of the white beans (rather than 1).  Instead of 2 cloves of garlic...more like 6.  I used the entire can of tomatillos (24ozs).  Spices I pretty much doubled - no coriander, but did add cayenne (1 tsp) for a kick.  Used can corn instead of fresh.  Topped with fresh lime, cilantro and green onions.  Fantastic.  Certainly will make often!

Great healthy chili. I didn't have corn, but used newmans chunky salsa, & a can of diced tomatoes. Everything else I did the same, & it's great! I liked the broth thin. My teenagers loved it.

Great recipe.  I never made white bean chicken chili before and it turned out great.  I also used salsa verde, extra peppers and some corn starch.  My only suggestions is watch the garlic carefully when you are softening the garlic and onions.  Garlic burns easily and is an overpowering taste when it does.  I couldn't  find any suggestions on WHEN to add the cornstartch so I added it turns the end as it simmered and just added slowing to adjust thickness.

Delish!  Fantastic as is, but I've made it a few times and, like others, I customized this recipe a little bit.  I used a jar of salsa verde instead of tomatillos.  I used two cans of diced tomatoes w/ jalapenos, two cans of white beans, one box of chicken broth and 1/2 bag of frozen corn.  To make it really easy, I use the meat from a rotisserie chicken, but I've also made many times without chicken at all and it is superb!  Great cold weather food and super easy to make! Yum!

I enjoyed this and so did everyone who tried  it (block party for Halloween).  I didn't think it was great so I probably won't make it again unless I make some changes.

Very very good. I made this at the work for 9 hungry firefighters and they all loved it. I usaully refuse to make adjustments to anyone's recipes, but our local grocer does not carry tomatillos. So I used Salsa Verde as a substitute after reading other reviews. This recipes is also a healthy alernative to many other chili recipes. Thanks for providing us a great dinner at the firehouse.

outstanding! use canned jalepenos, but 13 oz. instead of 18 oz. gives the soup some more flavor, without being overtaken.

My hubby's fav recipe as of first bite.  Substitutions were 2-10 oz. cans Ro-Tel Lime & Cilantro diced tomatoes for regular diced tomatoes, 4 fresh tomatillos for canned tomatillos, canned turkey for canned chicken, large shallot for chopped onion, large jalepeno (removed seeds and ribs) for canned chilis.  (That is what I had on hand comparable to ingredients listed).  This chili has a KICK!  My 2 year old had 4ths.  8y/o son added sour cream to bring down the heat in his.  The spices were perfect!  I will search for no other "Chicken Chili" recipe.  Of course, it may not turn out the same twice in a row...that's the beauty of it!

This chili was very good. I used salsa verde instead of canned tomatillos, but i did put some fresh tomatillos on a plate for toppings along with avocado, cilantro, cheese, sour cream and limes. I only used 1 can of green chilies and a can of diced tomatoes + green chilies instead of plain tomatoes. I used 1/2 can of corn (just personal preference I dont care for corn but my family does) I drained all the canned foods for a heartier chili and used 1 can of white beans and 1 can of black beans. I also put about 2 teaspoons of juice from a jar of jalepenos to give it a little more kick. The recipe turned out great.

Love this recipe.  If you use fresh tomatillos, you will need to cook them down quite a bit.

This is the best chicken chili I've tried, I like that it's broth based and not creamy. My whole family loved it. I substituted 2 small cans of salsa verde for the tomatillos, added a little more broth, 2 cans of white beans instead of one and was generous with the seasoning. I was in a hurry so I purchased an already cooked rotisserie chicken for the meat. Came together in minutes, let it simmer and it was fantastic.

I changed this up a little by- boiling and shredding my chicken, adding bell pepper in with the onion and garlic, adding two small cans of salsa verde in place of the tomatillos as stated earlier, one can of Del Monte diced tomatoes with chilis and one can of mild Rotel rather than just regular diced tomatoes, and a small can of corn in place of the fresh. Everything I else I did as the recipe calls for. This chili was delicious!!! We ate it topped with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. I will defintely make aqain!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I didn't have any chicken.  I used up left over pork roast meat.  There really is little difference when it's cooked up this way.  I also used fresh tomatillos.  And after sauteing the onion and garlic, I put everything into the crock pot for 6 hours. The taste of the dish, while pretty good, tasted too hot without enough compensating flavour and I felt it should have a bit more body - it was too soupy. I ended up adding about 3 cups of  homemade baked beans and a tbsp chili powder. We thoroughly enjoyed this, served with rice and grated cheddar cheese. It made a huge amount - I will freeze the rest.  I won't hesitate to make this again.

This is an excellent recipe, but I made a lot of modifications as noted in the reviews (perhaps there needs to be a new recipe?) Here are the differences: used shredded chicken instead of diced, used salsa verde instead of tomatillos, used frozen corn instead of fresh, used fresh jalapenos and one habanero (I like it very spicy, which it was) instead of canned peppers, increased the cumin to 1/2 tsp, and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch for thickening.  It really was delicious.  Like another reviewer noted, a lot of the flavor comes from the salsa verde, so choose that one wisely.

This recipe was great!  I have the habit of "doctoring" up recipes that I find, but the only change I made was that I added a diced red bell pepper with the onion and garlic. Definitely a cook-off winner.

This has become a fall/winter favorite of mine!  Sorry to all the other soups/chilis sitting in my recipe box.  I do use a little extra salsa verde and chicken broth and it comes out more like soup then chili, but fantastic flavors and heat!

I prepared the recipe as stated except for using salsa verde instead of the tomatillos.  I didn't think it was good at all!  The flavors didn't seem to complement each other, so I won't make this again.

This was outstanding. Like others, I tweaked here and there, but only because I used what I had in the house, but YUM!

This was the best. Has a really good taste. I added a can of tomato juice to mine. I don't like spicy chili so I left out the jalapeno's and it was just fine.

This was sooooo good.  It does turn out a little soupy.  I reserved some white beans and turned them into a paste in the food processor and then added to the chili.  It thickened the sauce a bit.  Call it soup, call it chili.  Either way it is great.

Awesome chili. I was not able to find canned tomatillos at my grocery store, only the fresh variety. I steamed them with some anaheim and jalapenos. Otherwise I followed the recipe and the chili came out great.

Delicious with several other reviews suggestions: Salsa Verde, a little cornstarch, and extra cumin. I was afraid it would be spicy or a little too seasoned for my toddler, but it was milder than I expected. Definitally could be spiced up with jalapenos in some form (with diced tomatoes or fresh, sauteed.). Thanks for the recipe!

Needed more spice. Was rather salty but otherwise lacked flavor. Very good texture and color. With a bit more cumin, chili powder, and cayenne pepper, it would have been perfect.

This was awesome, at least for me.  I'll have to tone it down for my wife.  I put in the milk / cornstarch as one reviewer suggested and swapped in a jar of Mrs. Renfro's green salsa for the tomatillos.  Simmered it 1/2 hour.  Had it with Lime Tostitos and fat free sour cream.  Excellent.  I have a cold and found this to be therapeutic as well as delicious!!!

This was a great "throw-together" meal.  It turned out so well that I called a girlfriend to join us for impromptu dinner. I did not have the tomatillos on hand and made without with good success.  Yum!  Make this one today.

This chili was excellent. I could not find tomatillos in the can so I used tomatillo salsa it worked great. Also added some crushed tortilla chips so that it would be a little thinker. My family loved it.

Very good, with or without the beans. It was nice to have a different soup to make as an alternative to beef chili. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was terrific. I didn't use any broth and used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes. I didn't need the corn starch as it was already thick enough. It was super easy to make. Next time I will use shredded chicken. Thanks!

I loved this chili and so did my 9 y/o.  Of course we changed a few things.  Instead of the tomatillos I added Mexican seasoned tomatoes and omitted the coriander.  I added two cans of white beans (Navy) and I used at least 3 cups of chicken broth.  It was very, very good and I will make it a staple in our kitchen!

This was my very first time making homemade soup & my family & I absolutely loved it! I used 1 can of salsa verde, 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes & one can of rotel with lime. I boiled & shredded the chicken & let simmer for a few hours. This recipe is defiantly a new family favorite.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

If you have young children stick to the original recipe.  Many reviewers are recommending replacing the tomatillas with salsa verde.  That would have been way to spicy for my kids.  Having said that, this chili is fantastic!  We put sour cream, cheese and chips in ours when we served it.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Even my picky kids liked this one! We used only half can of tomatilloes (left over from an enchilada recipe, made the night before) but this is one of those forgiving recipes where you can fudge the ingredients. Will make again, and might try using verde sauce instead of tomatilloes, which are rather expensive and hard to find.

Made this last night with a leftover chicken from the deli. Used a 16 oz jar of salsa verde and the Rotel with lime like the other users suggested. Fried some homemade tortila chips and it was amazing!

Very Good. I used the Salsa Verde as so many others did. I doubled the recipe up. It came a little too spicy for my husband's taste. I may have added too much cumin. I just added more chicken broth and threw in a can of kidney beans.

This is my husbands favorite!
I used rotel instead of the tomatinos and did not have corriander.  I also sub the veggie oil for olive oil (my usual sub).  I cut the chicken broth in 1/2 and add an extra can of beans to make it thicker.  I have even made this in the crock pot and let it thicken for 4hours.
Thank you for this! Noel

It's always tough for me to rate recipes when I've mucked about with them, but this one definitely gave me a great starting point.  Though I found fresh tomatillos, I went for a jar of salsa verde anyway.  I also used fresh jalapenos and poblano peppers (one of each) in place of the green chilis.  Used some fresh tomoatoes AND a can of diced (with added spices) and a can of corn rather than fresh.  Boosted the cumin, added some tabasco, and most of a can of Mexican-style lager.  Also used more beans -- half great Northern, half white.  It was quite spicy, but very good.  Would definitely make it again, maybe experimenting with different peppers and beans.  This freezes very well, too.

I brought this recipe in for our office chili cookoff contest on halloween.  I won!  Thank you so much!  Everyone was skeptical at first, not the typical chili, but once they tried it they were hooked!  I did follow other suggestions: using a jar of salsa verde, 2 cans northern beans, one can corn and one more cup of chicken broth.  Also, I used the entire rotissere chicken.  I had to stretch out to feed 15.  Using lime made a big difference too, but add to your bowl not to entire recipe.

After reading the review by Loves2cookinMN I used most of her suggestions.  I made a couple of changes though.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes that I blended before adding to the soup for a creamier consistency.  I also left out the corn. It made a great meal for very few Weight Watcher points.

I made again and used Goya salsa verde, can corn, extra tomatoes and extra beans (1 can next time). This time I used ground turkey and chicken breast. I like the consistency with both. Sorry for reviewing with all the changes, but since Allrecipe took NOTES away, I have no good way of keeping tracks of changes I made. Delicious the original way or with changes. I served with sour cream.

Really good!! Substituted an extra can of diced tomatoes for the tomatillos as some reviewers suggested. Also used frozen corn. Agree the sour cream is key at the end. Had it with corn bread and tortilla chips and it was wonderful!

This was a really great & easy to prepare chili.  My family loves Texas chili, but this was the first Chicken chili recipe that was so well received in my household.  It's a family staple today.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I chose to shred the chicken rather than dice it.  I didn't care for the tomatillos too much.  They tasted just like tomatoes, but the green color was strange.  Next time I will just add another can of tomatoes.  Other than that I would not change a thing.  The seasonings were perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was wonderful.  I subbed salsa verde for the tomatillos, and I also used frozen corn, as that was what I had on hand.  I also used a second can of beans.  It was very good.

Great Recipe!  Great Flavor!  I did add another can of beans, and a can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes instead of regular diced, and I used frozen Sweet Corn (can't get fresh around here this time of year).  And if you're Brave try throwing in some Pickled Jalapenos.  YUM!

Yum! This was tasty, the first day and as leftovers. I used a jar of Salsa Verde instead of the tomatillos, jalapenos, and green chilies. I thought it was a bit too spicy, but my husband loved it!! This is definately a keeper!!

I used the advice of others and used the tomatoes with green chili ( one can regular , one can Ro-Tel) and the Salsa Verde. I prefer homemade chicken broth so I boiled a chicken with onion, carrot, celery and bay leaf. Then just skimmed off the grease, deboned the chicken and continued to add the ingredients...yummy thanks!

Thank you for sharing this easy, yet marvelous chili recipe. I also used 2 jalapenos, and verde sauce. I served it with honey corn bread fresh out of the oven, sour cream and tortilla chips. There are only two of us in the house most the time, so we have some left over. But that's the thing about chili and stews, they get even tastier as the indgredients absorb each other's flavors longer. This stuff is even better as a left over. My boyfriend took some of the it to work today for lunch and said he not only liked it, but loved it!

My husband and I loved this. We just had it this afternoon. I made a few changes as people suggested. I use Salsa Verde in place of tomatillos. I used 2 cans of chili style tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes and green chilis. I added a can of pinto beans and a can of red kidney beans instead of white beans and I omitted the corn. I also added some lime zest and juice. 

I threw it all in the crock pot last night and then we had lunch this afternoon. Also I topped it with avocado, cheese and cilantro. I wish I had bought corn tortilla chips to go with it too. Oh well, I will be making this much more in the future so I can try that next time!

Delicious with some changes; used beef broth instead of chicken, Safeway's Salsa Verde instead of tomatillos, crushed tomatoes, canned corn, a bunch of cumin, green beans, zucchini, carrot and a threw a couple of cups of rice in at the end. Needed extra stock and was very thick, but flavorful in the end. Yummy!!

This chili was really good, but I will doing things differently next time around.  I substituted the canned tomatillos for 2- 7 ounce cans of salsa verde (didn't realize the can said "hot") and I thought I would die!  Next time, I will be using mild salsa verde and will use only about half the onions.  Otherwise, this recipe is great!

I found this to be a good, easy dish to make. I suspect the people who complained that it lacked something might benefit from frying the spices just before adding the wet ingredients, which would enhance the spice flavour, especially if their spices are a bit old. I added a splash of vinegar as I do not have access to tomatillo's, which I assume are a bit more acidic, judging by how many people opted for salsa. Thank you!I enjoyed it and made perfect use of what I had available.

Oh my gosh.  This was one hot dish for me.  My husband picked the peppers (my mistake).  Once I got over the burn in my mouth, I really enjoyed the chili.  I might add a bit more salt and other spices to balance out the hotness of the pepper next time.

This was really good.  I used Salsa Verde as suggested by other reviewers, added diced tomatoes, black beans and extra onions and cumin.  With my additions, it turned into just another chicken tortilla soup, but it tasted great!

Very hearty, tasty chili.  Thanks for sharing this.  I added some kidney beans as well as white beans.  Also, I decided that next time I make this, I will make a little spicer.  That is just my taste!

Oh my SO YUM! I did this slow cooker style. Threw in frozen chicken tenders at the bottom and everything else on top. Even better the next day. I definitely recommend adding some cheese and sour cream at the end.

I made this with fresh tomatillos instead of canned (all I could find) and thought this was just okay.  Maybe I used too many, it was pretty tangy.  I also added a second can of beans and used frozen corn instead of fresh.  If I made this again I would take other reviewers suggestions of substituting salsa verde for the tomatillos as this would add more spiciness.  I will say too I was looking for something healthy & low cal so didn't put toppings on besides avocado and I think this would have really made a difference too.

This is a keeper!  Reminds me of a spicy Chicken Tortilla soup instead of chili. It even pleased my picky husband.

Pretty good but I have had better.  I might make this again using it more of a base and adding a few more spices and touches.

This is a really delicious recipe! I've made it numerous times. I agree that you can wing it... I usually have most of the ingredients on hand but even when I'm missing something and I substitute ingredients with what I do have, it's great. We've also strained the broth and made burritos! Add some cheese and sour cream and they're wonderful.

This was a huge hit! Couldnt find canned tomatillos so I used fresh ones chopped up and then added them to the onion and garlic while frying. At the very end I added a cup of cream to make this a creamy version. My chicken was blackened and worked really well....had a wonderful flavor.

This recipe was wonderful.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!  I did use two cans of beans.  Also I used a 16 ounce jar of Salsa Verde in place of the tomatillos as I couldn't find them in the store.

I omitted the corn, but it still turned out delicious.  A nice change from beef chili and goes well with tortilla chips.  Cheddar cheese garnish and sour cream are a must!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a regular in my house now and everyone loves it!  I pressure cook a fryer chicken to make this with and it is AWESOME.  Great diet food to boot!

I made this chili for a crowd and not only did they all want the recipe, they asked to take any leftovers home! I couldn't find tomatillos so I used all red tomatoes.

We loved this!  I also added black beans and corn and used a jar of salsa verde because I couldn't find canned tomatillos.  Very delicious!  Will definitely make again.

My daughter made this for us and the whole family loved it.   It's great leftover, too.  Just add a little cheese, sour cream and lime juice and you have a supurb meal.
