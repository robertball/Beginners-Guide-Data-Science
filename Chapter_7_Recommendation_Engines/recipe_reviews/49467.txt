Loved the flavor, made some small changes in preparing.  I first placed the ribs in a large pot and covered with water.  Covered, and simmered 1 hour.  Drained the ribs and transfered to a shallow dish.  After preparing the glaze I let it cool slightly and then poured over the ribs.  Let the ribs marinate at least 2 hours, I let mine marinate over night.  Grilled them while frequently basting... it was soooo good.  A little spicy for those with sensitive taste buds.  My boyfriend loved the flavor, but said they were too hot to eat as many as he wanted.

I absolutely LOVED the flavor of this sauce, but was very disappointed in the end result.  It didn't flavor up the ribs as much as I thought it would, so our ribs tasted as if we hadn't added any sauce at all.  Next time I may consider marinating the ribs in the sauce first, because I truly did think the sauce was outstanding, I just wanted the ribs to absorb more of the flavor.

4 stars for original recipe, 5 with my changes... I took another reviewer's advice and boiled the ribs first.  I also added about 4 cloves of minced garlic to the glaze and marinated the glazed ribs overnight.  We took them to a 4th of July BBQ and they were the hit of the party!  Sweet, sticky, and spicy good!  We will definitely make these again.

These were great! Its something different than the regular BBQ ribs. I was looking for something new and I sure found a winner! I didn't use the full amount of honey for fear it would be too sweet. I was slightly under the called amount. I used spicy brown mustard, because that is what I had on hand. I used a 1.5 teaspoon of cayenne. Seasoning was perfect. I did not bother adding 1/2 salt because the cajun seasoning can get pretty salty. I figured its easy to add than take out. I made the sauce in the am. Let ribs sit in it through the day. Threw them in the oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours give or take. I had them covered with foil and took it off last 45/30 mins. It made the sauce thick and great. My husband loved it and is asking for it again. I think this was a real winner and will be making this again.

These were delicious!  My boyfriend couldn't get enough of them.  The only changes I made were that I substituted a chipotle seasoning blend for the cajun seasoning, and reduced the red pepper flakes by about a tablespoon (because the chipotle stuff is pretty hot by itself).  And, I boiled the ribs for about 1 hr., let them cool for a bit, and then covered them with the sauce and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I baked them in a 300 degree oven for about 40 min., and then browned up both sides under the broiler while frequently basting them with more sauce. Mmmm, the edges were all crispy and carmelized.  It was a little spicy for my 8-yr. old though - she dipped hers in applesauce to cool it down a bit.    The sauce is SO good that I'm going to try it on steak tips the next time.

Wow! I cut the crushed red pepper by 1/2 and still had to skim some from the sauce before putting it on the ribs. I also simmered the ribs for about 30 min. then let them marinate in the sauce for 1 hr before putting on the grill. They browned very fast (almost burned) so I ended up putting them in a covered casserole dish with the reserved sauce and slow cooked at 250 for 3 more hours. This was delicious and I will definately make the sauce again, with only 1Tbsp of red pepper. I also sauted 1 large clove of garlic with the onions.

Very spicy. I used spicy brown mustard and only a cup of honey. Boyfriend loved the sauce and he loves spicy food. I will definitely make again.

Be forewarned, this makes a lot of sauce! I'll definitely be making this again though. It was spicy enough for my tastes halving the red pepper, but other than that the recipe was pretty straightforward. I felt really rewarded for trying this out. 5 stars!

Only change I made was at the last 10 minutes of grilling I added some Sweet Baby Ray’s Sweet Brown Sugar & Hickory BBQ sauce. Didn’t hurt the flavor at all, in fact the Sweet Baby Ray’s gave a nice bit of tang at first & the original sauce gave it a final nice sweet taste. Excellent! Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe as far as the sauce, but used boneless country style ribs for meat.  And I don't have a charcoal or gas grill, so used my stove.  First seasoned meat w/salt & pepper & fried in a little oil to get them good and browned.  Transferred to a baking dish and spooned some sauce over, covered w/foil & baked...then removed foil, poured rest of sauce over & turned ribs over...they came out so good!! We really liked the sauce, couldn't find one thing I'd change about it at all... Oh, served with the Mashed Potato Quesadillas (from this site) and hubby was pleased with dinner...happy campers here!

This is wonderful!!! I have made it many times and had to swap different ingredients for what I had on hand.  Once I used regular mustard and it was still wonderful.  Another time I made a simple syrup with a bit of water and brown sugar in place of the honey.  I NEVER use the amount of red pepper flakes, but have added a few squirts of Buffalo Wing sauce in exchange. Overall, I love it no matter what I do or don't have on hand!! Yummy!

This recipe is great but it is super spicy.  All that red pepper takes a toll.  I couldn't eat my ribs that hot every time, so from now on I'll probably halve the amount of red pepper flakes I use.  I also substituted spicy brown mustard for dijon and really enjoyed it.

Turned out great. I would recommend evening out the honey and mustard portion. Besides that all was well. Great recipe.

This was great! But wayyyy too SPICY! I've made it twice once with 1 Tbs of red pepper flakes and a second time with 1/2 Tablespoon. Reducing the pepper made it so much better. I also slightly decreased the vinegar the 2nd time. This can be made in the slow-cooker as well.

Loved this sauce! I too, used Country ribs and baked them. Added minced garlic and cut back on the pepper flakes as recommended by others and was disappointed, using them all next time. Can't wait to make this sauce for chicken and fish and try it on the grilled ribs!

We don't like a lot of spice so I left out the cajun seasoning and reduced the Dijon mustard, but left in the red pepper flakes.  It made a wonderful sweet with a bit of a bite sauce.  I simmered the ribs for an hour in water and apple juice, then marinated them for 2 hours in the sauce.  I then put them on the grill for a few minutes, continuing to baste with the sauce.  Best ribs ever!!
