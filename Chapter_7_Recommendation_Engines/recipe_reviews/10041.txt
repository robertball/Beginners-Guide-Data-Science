This was an EXCELLENT recipe. Although there is no way on earth you can get 3 dozen out of it, these cookies were SOFT, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, DELICIOUS, and took me only 20 minutes to prepare and BAKE! Perfect for on the go cookies. I rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, definnentely a 10. Keep up the good work, but watch the number you put in as a yield.

This recipe was very easy.  I had to adjust the amount of flour to 1 cup because the batter was too thin.  All in all a very good cookie, my guests gave me compliments.

I have a hard time figuring out how the recipe made 3 dozen. The recipe did not specify the size of the final product and even after doubling the recipe, I had a hard time squeezing 3 dozen out of it.

I didn't care for these cookies at all.  I made the recipe as directed.  I scooped them onto an ungreased cookie shhet using a 1 tsp ice cream scooper and baked them for the stated 10 minutes at 400F.  What started as a ball turned into a 1/4 tall very spread out blob with burned edges.  After letting them cool 10 minutes I used a metal spatula (I tried one that will flex and one too thick to flex) but I was unable to remove the cookies from the cookie sheet without them falling apart.  They are very bland and taste like raw flour.  I will definately not be making this one again.

I also revised the recipie.  I tried greasing the cookie sheet and the cookies burned around the edges.  They also were too runny.  Using a UNGREASED cookie sheet, dropping dough by rounded teaspoon fulls, and baking at 350 degrees for 7 minutes worked great!  With Christmas time they were great with colored sugar sprinkles worked well also.

A very good cookie.  If you like your butter cookies a little softer this is a good one.  But, BEWARE!  They will be gone quickly!  I got it to make three dozen (well, 2 1/2 but the kids "licked" a lot of the batter) small cookies.  I used a small spoonful to drop them onto the sheetl.

These were very, very good. And so easy to make! I ended up with about a dozen average sized cookies, but they'd make about three dozen cookies a bit bigger than a silver dollar like the butter cookies that come in a tin. They're good plain, or with a dollop of jam, or covered in sugar. Soft and yummy. Would reccomend to anyone.

In fairness to the recipe owner, the original recipe is for 3 dozen cookies but you must set your own serving size to 36 servings to get ingredients for that much.  I tried to do 2 dozen, without greasing the pan, at 375 degrees for 8 minutes since my gas oven cooks hot and fast.  The bottoms and edges burned while the centers were under cooked. :(  I used sprinkles for the topping.  The 3 stars are for the yummy flavor of the few that cooked just right - very light and not too sweet!  Would be yummy with tea!

I made the recipe exactly as directed. I did not have problems with the batter being too thin as other people stated and I used a melon baller so I got 36 cookies out of the recipe. The problem was that the cookies don't taste good. Both my kids made faces. They described them as bland and flavorless. I used chocolate chips on one batch, raisins in the other. Neither were good. Bleck!

Definitely 1 cup of flour and bake at 350 for 8 min. as previously suggested. I rolled the dough into balls and put a chocolate rosette on top.

Based on other reviews, I doubled this recipe. I ended up with about 2 dozen 3 inch cookies. I increased the vanilla to a full teaspoon, which is just a personal preference.  I did not add any raisins, chocolate, or nuts.  Just made them plain.  The cookies were excellent, especially warm. My family loved them. They are buttery, cake-like, and melt in your mouth. I baked them for 6-7 minutes.  Ten minutes would have resulted in burnt cookies.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I dunno what I did wrong (I followed the recipe exactly), but the bottoms of the cookies mostly burned for me? I wasn't sure how large the cookies should be-- you would only get 3 dozen if you dropped them by the 1/2 tsps. For the last batch, I baked the cookies for 7 minutes and they turned out okay. Lucky for me that I just made these for myself as a treat, but I don't know if I will make these cookies again. Thanks for the recipe though!

I made the dough and thought it was a bit buttery so I read the reviews. Boy I'm glad I did. I ended up using a full cup instead of 3/4 cup flour. (I used rum extract by the way.) Now as for the cookie being to thin...my first batch was fine but  the cookies came out squarish and spread into each other. The SECOND batch I decided to make the drops smaller, say about 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons. I also reduced the temperature to 375 and baked them for 12-14 minutes. That made a huge difference. They came out perfectly round and in my opinion, absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making more RIGHT NOW!!!  PS- I didn't put any toppings on them but I will be trying chocolate chips in the next batch.

These cookies were easy and delicious! I rolled each in powdered sugar before baking, and the surface turned light and crunchy while baking.  The recipe amount is a perfect family-sized serving, but if you are baking for many people I suggest you double or triple the recipe.

I really like this recipe.  The cookies are melt in your mouth good, light, airy and moist.  The only thing is, I maybe got 2 dozen cookies after I doubled the recipe.  I also upped the sugar a bit and added 2 more teaspoons of vanilla.  This is a keeper.

I, too had to add more flour as the cookies spread a lot in the first minute of baking.  Maybe we just need to make the dropped spoonfuls smaller?  I liked them okay, but my husband won't eat them.  His favorite is oatmeal raisin, so go figure.  I also added about a tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter to the last batch and they were quite yummy.

These cookies are a little different every time I make them. Sometimes they run and are skinny and flat and stick together, and sometimes they stay put  and circular and are thicker, either way, they're almost always very good so long as I watch the cookies themselves and get them out as they've just turned golden brown. Tip: Try mixing it up by substituting different extracts. I've tried lemon, almond, and orange, and all add just a little bit different flavor. My mom loves the lemon, but I think almond is probably my favorite!

This didn't work for me.  I didn't like the texture of this cookie.  It spread out very thinly, and  almost burnt on the edges while cakey in the middle.  I tried turning the oven down to 350, and then tried chilling the dough to reduce spreading.  Neither worked.  This is not for me.

Great cookies! Dough was more like batter; I increase the flour by up to 1/2 cup. I also add a teeny bit more butter, a teeny bit of sea salt, and about 1/4 tsp. lemon extract; it seems to bring out the buttery taste. They might be good with a bit of lemon zest thrown in. Also, use parchment paper to bake on and set timer for 9 minutes - much easier clean-up, and the lesser baking time allows me to get back into the kitchen in time to prevent over browning, which they do have a tendency toward. Mine have been coming out almost perfectly every batch now. And, boy are they popular!
