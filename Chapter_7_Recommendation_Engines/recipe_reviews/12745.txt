I too am not a measurer. I spread salsa across the fish and sprinkled them heavily with cheese. I also used a spicy corn chip which added to the flavor. My fish-hating daughter loved it.
One note: If you use frozen fish, make sure to press out the excess water otherwise you'll have a swimming pool of water in the dish.

OMG, I don't see how this could get any easier!  I used talapia and baked for 30 min.  No measuring, just dumped the ingredients on, and it tasted EXCELLENT!

This was excellent. My boyfriend DEVOURED this. I used catfish instead as I think cod fish is very "fishy". My only concern with this meal was that it was kind of watery in the dish while cooking. My salsa was really chunky so I think that it was the fact that I did not pat the filets dry enough before putting them in the oven. Also, I get antsy about fish being cooked completely & by putting all of the ingredients on top of it immediately, it was hard for me to tell. Next time, I will cook the fish for 10 minutes just to be sure & then add the salsa, cheese & tortilla chips. Great recipe! Thanks for posting it.

Excellent recipe!  I used Tilapia instead of cod and combined cheddar and pepper jack cheese for a little spice.  Once baked, I put the fish under the broiler for a few minutes to really crisp up the corn chips. Kids loved it!

Abosultely delicious.  I can't wait to make this for company.  So easy and so good.  You must try this if you want a fun new fish recipe.  I would cook this for 30 minutes instead of 15 though as after 15 minutes the fish was still raw inside.  That could be because we used halibut which is a little thicker than cod.

WOW! I made this for my 7-year-old son and best friend and they raved! Alek got on the phone with his dad and announced that this was "his favorite meal"! Like some of the other reviewers, I made this with chicken instead of fish. What I did: I dipped boneless skinless chicken breasts in egg, and battered them with breadcrumbs, put them in the greased pan, then followed the rest of the instructions. YUM! I couldn't find a ripe avocado at the grocery store and was very bummed, but the dish was still delicious! It was so easy too!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was so good, and so simple.  Like other reviewers, I used boneless chicken tenderloins instead of fish.  I used Safeway's Select Mild Southwest Style salsa, crushed Doritos corn chips, and medium cheddar.  Low Fat sour cream and avacados were used for the topping.  My company loved it, and the tiny portion of leftovers (from doubling the recipe!) was as good, or better the next day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow this was terrific for something so easy, quick and everything goes right from the package to the baking pan, so there is only one pan to clean up.  Although I can't say I've never tasted anything as good - it is very good and combined with the ease, and speed, it's a KEEPER.  
Quick note, I couldn't handle having corn chips in the house and only using 1/2 cup, so I just sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs on top instead of the chips.

Easy, easy and delicious - what more can you ask for - I used frozen fish and cooked it 1/2 the time drained the liquid then added the salsa, cheese & tortilla chips and put back in for remainder of time - turned out perfect.

Taste- 4 stars, ease of preparation- 5 stars.  I could easily guess the outcome of this recipe is based on the quality of your ingredients.  To the salsa, I added extra tomato, chopped roasted peppers, olives etc.  My end result was a little watery because my fish was just defrosted.  Next time I will make sure my fish is dry and leave it marinating in the salsa for an hour before baking so my not-best-quality-frozen-fish can take on some more flavour.  Excellent easy summer recipe served with tortillas, salad and so on.  Leftovers were good with rice, too.
Post note:  Made it again.  Put just undercooked i stock brown rice on the bottom and added kidney beans, corn and chopped tomatoes to the salsa.  Cooked up beautifully and was basically a complete meal in itself although  I still had avocado and tortillas on the side.

This is a tough one to rate. On the one hand, it came out exactly as you would expect. However, I think this dish would be best for those who don't like or aren't that crazy about fish. The salsa, cheese, avocado, and fritos do a good job of "disguising" the fish. However, if you're like me and you love fish, you will probably be disappointed. I gave it 4 stars because, to be fair, the dish tastes fine, but I'd call it more of a fish nacho dish than a seafood dinner. And some reviewers have said this is a healthy dish, but I don't agree, necessarily. Fish is much healthier without fritos and cheese!

I have made this dish more than dozen times now and we still love it.  I love the fact that it's so versatile, I can use many different kinds of fish and it still tastes great.  I have used tilapia, cod, orange roughy, mahi mahi, and halibut.

This was a great way to change things up from the normal dinner routine.  I also had the issue of watery-ness in the bottom of my baking dish, so make sure you press out the water really well before cooking the fish.  I served it with the "Best Black Beans" and "Mexican Rice II" recipes from this site.  My husband and I both devoured it and he told me to put it on the "keeper" list.  Thanks ChristyJ!

I made it on Tuesday. I asked my husband how many stars we should give it. He said 5. I made it again on Wednesday, but with chicken. We gave it 5 stars also. That would make it a 10 star recipe in my family! Both nights I added a little fresh corn cut off the cob and I used lowfat sour cream and cheese. Great "keeper" recipe!

This was excellent and very easy! I am a newlywed and not much of a cook. I made this for my husband and my mother, who is a wonderful cook.  They both loved it and my mother got the recipe! I used only 1 1/2 pounds of tilapia.  I laid the fillets very tightly together in a smaller casserole dish than the recipe called for. I mixed hot and medium salsa to give it the right amount of "kick" and combined cheddar and shredded pepper jack cheese to top.  The fresh avocado I got was not good, so we ate it with fresh guacamole and sour cream on the side.  Excellent and my husband's favorite dish I've made!

I tried this recipe last night and it turned out wonderful.   I really didn't measure the ingredients.   I think that depends on your taste; however, the basic plan was great.   I used alaskan pollock and my other half said 'put this one in your recipe file'.   So - I did.  Enjoy - Enjoy - Enjoy

I tried this last night. My husband is the kind that will eat anything and says it's alway "good". This recipe he actually said it was "delicious". That is a very big compliment coming from him. Needless to say, this will be make again in our house.

A hit! I sprinkled garlic powder and paprika over the fillets before pouring the salsa over top. I also mushed 2 avacados and mixed in 1 tbsp of lemon juice.

The salsa and cheese combo can't go wrong, even on fish! Drizzled lime juice on cod before adding salsa (as suggested by the previous reviewer) and served it with fresh cilantro. Great way to get the entire family to eat fish!

My entire family loved this recipe! I used Talapia filets, hot salsa, and Sargento's 4 cheese Mexican blend. The flavor was excellent and it was so easy to make. I served the fish with sides of black beans and rice and seasoned corn on the cob. A wonderful meal that I will make again soon!

I'm not really much of a fish fan, and this recipe was great because it had enough other flavors that the fish was more like a seasoning rather than the sole focus of the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband is a chef and my in-laws are gourment cooks. This was the first time I got up the nerve to cook for them. The recipe was sooo easy and fast. Even a non cook like me can make it. I'm very happy to say they LOVED it! They couldn't get over how great it was! I used Mahi Mahi as a substitution and it was wonderful!

I made this recipe using chicken tenders instead of fish.  FABULOUS!!  My whole family raved.  This was so good that my 3 year old daughter informed me that I am "the bestest cooker ever!"

This was an excellent tasting dish and extremely easy to prepare. My husband, adult son and teenage daughter all loved it. I used Mahi Mahi which worked very well. I seasoned the fish with garlic and fresh ground pepper before pouring on the salsa; I also let the fish "marinade" in the salsa about 30 min before topping with crushed tortilla chips & cheese and baking. The sour cream and avocado slices really added to it.

Never written a review before, but had to for this recipe! This is delicious! I could not believe how easy it was! I would serve this to company it was so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and like others baked my fish a few minutes to eliminate some of the water. The avacado is a must! It really added to the taste!

Made this (Gluten Free) tonight with Halibut,  It was wonderful...my DH had 3 servings and cleaned the baking dish.  I wasn't much on measuring, cut the Halibut filet in 3 pieces, spread a thin layer of chunky spicy salsa over the top, threw in a couple  handfuls of frozen corn, a bit of shredded cheese substitute (Lactose Free) and topped with about a cup of smashed tortilla chips.  Baked at 400 for about 20minutes (maybe the thickness of the pieces caused it to need a bit more time) tented with foil the last 10 minutes so that the chips wouldn't brown too darkly.. My DH isn't much on avacado and I'm lactose intolerent, so no sour cream...  but it didn't need anything else.. The perfect flavor, the richness of the fish and the crunch of the chips made this dish, one that I will make again and again... maybe with margaritas next time.

Have made again and again..  used Halibut, Red Snapper and Rockfish...Have used a Mango/Peach Salsa with GREAT results.  Cheese doesn't matter (can't really taste it)  The addition of corn is a crowd pleaser.  Sangria is very good with this dish.

i have had this recipe saved for over a year now b/c i just couldn't believe it would be all that great.  trust me--it *IS*.  i made sure to squeeze all the water out of the fish using dish towels so the dish wouldn't be swimming in water (no pun intended!), used basa instead of the cod, and added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the fillets.  i didn't measure anything and instead just threw everything on top to my liking.  i also put it under the broiler at the end for abt. three mins. just to crispen the chips.  and, i used pepper cheddar instead of the reg. sharp variety, but i do not think that was a miracle ingredient...it's just what i had handy and it needed to be used up.  this is unbelievably delicious and definitely worthy of serving to company!!!  will be making this again SOON.  everyone in the family *loved* it.

Thank you for a great recipe and so easy. We love salsa and it seems to pair very well with fish.   Suggest a squirt of lime juice over the fish before adding the salsa.

Very easy, fairly healthy and tasty.  I used about 1 1/4 pounds of cod. The fillets were thick, so I left them in the oven an additional 15-20 minutes.  I substituted Cabot 50% reduced fat Jalepeno cheddar cheese for the sharp cheddar. Midway through cooking, I added the corn chips and about 1/2 cup halved grape tomatoes. I preferred the sweet and fresh flavor of the grape tomatoes to the jarred salsa. Topped it off with the avacado, light sour cream, and salt which were excellent compliments.
A lot of liquid was at the bottom of my pan but it didn't follow the fish to the plate so I was not bothered. 

Tip: If you don't want corn chips lingering in your kitchen, buy one single serving bag of Fritos - the 30 cent bags that tend to be found on display racks near the front of most grocery stores. It turned out to be just under 1/2 cup after I crushed them a bit.

I too thought that this may taste strange on fish, but fear not!  We LOVE Tilapia in our family and I was eager to find a new way to prepare it.  
I used mild salsa and the packaged shredded Mexican blend cheese since that is what I had on hand. Instead of avocado slices and sour cream on the side, I mixed the two for a simple guacamole and topped the fish with this once on the plate.
In addition, I used Uncle Ben's Mexican Fiesta rice and put a handful of black beans in it after cooking.
VERY QUICK, VERY EASY!  The true test was when my 11 year old asked if he could have seconds! Will definetly prepare again.  Thanks so much, Christine!

I invited some friends over last night and decided to give this recipe a try.   It was delicious.   Everyone complimented me on the meal and wanted the recipe.   I did use tilapia instead of cod and it turned out great.

My husband doesn't like fish at home unless it is deep or pan fried, but he loved this one! I used talapia fish instead and it turned out great. I served it with a black bean and corn salsa and some spanish rice with corn torillas on the side. It is going to be a regular meal at our house.

We both liked this recipe a lot. I used farm-raised catfish and it was 'delish'.  Those of you not yet familiar w/ farm-raised catfish - it is a very mild fish and adapts to any recipe.

This is the best and easiest fish dish around. I have made it nunerous time for people and everyone has loved it. I don't even measure the ingredients and it always turns out. Pop some oven fries in and you have fish and chips for dinner!

This recipe was wonderful!  And sooooo easy!  I used a peach mango salsa and served the fish with quacomole rather than avacado and sour cream.  I also used talapia because cod wasn't available.  Tastes like a restaurant recipe!

This was fantastic.  I did make a few slight changes ... before I put the cheese on top, I added some freshly chopped cilantro.  I did not have cheddar cheese, so I used shredded colby jack.  Also I did not have corn chips, so I used black bean chips, crushed.  My husband, who does not really like fish, loved this dish.  It is a keeper and I will definitely be making this again.

My picky family loved it. I did not have enough fish on hand so I used imitation crab leg meat. Worked out great. I did not get to try this but I will make this again. 
Update:
I have made this several times as stated. It comes out great. I have used whatever white fish that I happen to have in the freezer. Always taste great.

I enjoyed this but my bf didn't care for it. He kept thinking it should be chicken instead of fish. I would make it again. I used talapia instead of cod cause that is what I had on hand.

Went looking for a recipe using cod and salsa, and found this! As a Paleo, I skipped the dairy and carbs, but the baking time was perfect. I used salsa verde (that's what I had in the cupboard) and it smelled WONDERFUL while baking. And the family loved it. This one's a keeper!

This was a big hit with the hubbs and our 3 and 6 year olds.  I loved the chips on the top! I squeezed fresh lemon juice on top of the fish first, I also used pepper jack cheese and broiled it on high for about 2 minutes at the end. Thanks for this, we will make it again!

WOW! Delicious and super easy!  I used frozen cod filets and spread them in a baking dish.  I topped them with Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa since I had a jar opened in the fridge and sharp cheddar cheese. I then baked them for about 10 minutes.  I then added crushed up Fritos corn chips on top and baked for another 15 minutes. I did not have avocado or sour cream but I didn't need it.  I served this with some Mexican rice and it was fabulous.

This was very good and soooooo easy!  I didn’t measure.  I just eyeballed the amounts of ingredients.  I used tilapia, topped it with salsa, and baked.  I didn’t add the cheddar cheese until after the fish was done, because I didn’t want it to get as hard as shoe leather!  After topping with cheese, I returned it to the oven just long enough for the cheese to melt nicely.  When plating I added the crushed chips (I used tortilla chips) and a dollop of sour cream.  I didn’t have an avocado, so I had to leave that out.  Very good and something we’ll do again!  Thank you!

AWSOME! This recipe was quick, easy, and inexpensive.  It received 10 out of 10 in my household.  I followed the recipe exactly (didn’t measure anything) and everything came out amazing. Cod was the perfect fish for this dish. When plating cut the Cod fillets into serving size portions and place on top of a small corn tortilla. We didn’t eat like tacos just cut the tortilla with the fish and forked it. The presentation looked as good as it taste.  I will be making this again!

My boyfriend and I loved this dish.  The only change I made was to mash the avocados with garlic and add some black olives.

Very good!  I didn't have enough cod, so I used a mixture of cod and tilapia.  I made as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

This was really good and so easy! Even my kids ate it, and I usually can't get them to touch fish. First time I made it, the fish ended up a little wet from the juices that came out during cooking, so the second time I cooked it on a roasting pan (sprayed with cooking spray) so the juices could drain and it was perfect!

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  I have made it several times now for my family.  The only thing I do different is I brush the fish w/ olive oil and sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it before I put it in the pan.  Oh, and here's a tip:  if you are using frozen fish, thaw it completely, then put it between thick layers of paper towels and press it like you do with tofu.  It holds a lot of water when it freezes, and for some recipes that's okay, but I often add this step before I cook with frozen fish.

Simple and delicious.  I heated up some flour tortillas and served the fish with some sour cream on the side.  I did leave out the avocado only because I was feeling lazy, but I can see how that would be a great addition.  I'll definately use it the next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Miracles have not ceased to exist! We rarely have fish at our house (though I have tried many, many times to find good recipes to please the fish hater. He did say this one is good and I can make it again!) I did do a few things differently: I used only 2 basa fillets instead, and I brushed a little taco seasoning on them (about 1Tbsp. seasoning to about 3Tbsp. water) first. I also used ripple chips for the crumbs cuz we had a bag open and about to go stale (and I used less than 1/2 cup), but they worked great! I sprayed the pan to prevent any sticking (just in case). I also used less (partly skimmed marble) cheese, which I think melts better anyway cuz you don't get the grease. I also omitted the avocado. The only thing I would do differently, to completely mask any trace of fishiness for my dear hubby, is to marinate it for about an hour or so in the taco seasoning mix. Thanks for the great recipe Christy!

This recipe was sooo good!! It was a very easy recipe, I didn't use any measurements. I used halibut and cut it into approx. 6 oz. pieces and covered it with ortega mild salsa, then I added some chipotle cheddar cheese, then sprinked a light mixture of a mexican cheese blend on top. Topped it off with a good amount of crushed tortilla chips. Instead of sour cream, we like to use an equal amount of mayo (best foods) and plain yogurt with lime juice. (you want to make it a tad bit tarter than sour cream). We served it ontop of the avocados. Then for the ones who like it spicy we added some spicy salsa. OH SOOOO GOOD!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this alot!!

This was really, really tastey!!  I hardly ever give recipes 5 stars, but this one is easy and flavorful.  I did not put the cheese or the corn chips on top because we were using it for fish tacos.  I just put some lemon juice on the fish and added salt, pepper and the salsa (trader joes chunky) topped with cilantro and green onions.  I heated up some corn tortillas and served with pinto beans (that I doctored up with cheese and cilantro), avocado and sour creme and cheese.  YUM! this is a keeper thanks!

this was great!! the only thing i would say is to maybe season the fish first with maybe cumin and salt and pepper or something. or use a spicier salsa than you would eat regularly. i used medium, which is what i would normally eat, but in the fish it disappeared a little. the flavor was there alright, but it did need a bit more of something. i also added the chips and cheese at the last 5 minutes as others have said to do. very good meal!!!!!!!!!! we will for sure eat again. with any fish!

Oops, forgot to review this last night! In terms of ingredients and preparation, this couldn't have been easier. I made it with a piece of walleye that's been doing nothing in the freezer for a while. Also, used medium salsa, and Ranch flavored chips. Served it with flour tortillas, and black beans. Husband loved it. Thanks, Christine!

Excellent!  Wonderful flavor!  Other than using more cheese because we ALWAYS use more cheese, and using Fritos corn chips, I followed the recipe almost exactly as written.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Ok, I do not usually provide a review, if I make a major change to an ingredient, but I felt that in this case, it wouldn't make a huge difference.  Originally, I had intended on using fish for this, well, fish recipe.  I ended up using chicken breasts, because the fish wasn't looking too appetizing at the store.  Other than that, I stuck exactly to the recipe as written.  It was fantastic and easy.  What made it better, was that my very picky (understatement) 8 yr old, ate every last bite and then asked when I was making it again.  For the record, I'll be making it again next week!

I really liked this recipe.  I don't even like fish that much, but I really liked this.  Something different.  My 2 year old son loved it.  I really liked the simplicity of the ingredients and I will definitely make it again and again!!  THANKS!

I am sorry, I read the reviews and thought it would be a great meal, but the salsa and chips didn't seem to do the fish any justice, it was more of a conflict of flavors. I may try this again but with chicken breasts, not fish.

This was very good; it's always surprising how salsa can make a fish so tasty, but it's a perfect balance for a mild fish. I hate fish and I liked this a lot; my boyfriend made a face as I was describing the prep and ended up enjoying this quite a bit.  I used flounder - which was nice and mild.  I can't wait to try this with chicken - like everyone else suggested.  The only thing was I couldn't taste the avocado over the rest of the flavors, so I may leave that out next time.  I also put a sprinkle of cayenne for a tiny bit of heat.

This was okay.  Pretty good, but not one I'd make again.  The kids didn't like it, and my husband thought it was "fine" which usually means he doesn't like it.  Easy to fix, though.

This was another allrecipes winner. I wasn't sure about the combiation of ingrediants either, but thought I'd give it a whirl. I used tilipia fish, a pineapple salsa and low fat mexican cheeses. Mmmm what a nice surprise.. this was yummy and very very fast. A keeper

A quick and surprisingly delicious dish. I used mild salsa and served it over white rice. Instead of soaking the filets in salt water, I rinsed them under a cold tap and soaked them in milk for a half hour(per Grandmas advice).It did the trick, no fishy taste!Blotted them dry and dressed 'em up!

Awesome! This should be number 1! I used to be of the opinion that nice fresh fish shouldn't be smothered with toppings, but no more! I used haddock instead of Cod and it was moist and delicious!

I used halibut.  As the fillets were large, I cut them into lengthwise fingers.  This allowed the fingers to bake evenly, and the serving portions were already measured out. So quick and easy to put together, and a totally different way of serving fish.
I thought it was truly a gormet dish, it  was WONDERFUL!  We will probably eat this every week!

I'm a terrible cook, but even I couldn't mess this one up, it turned out wonderful.  I recommend buying quality Mahi-Mahi and this recipe will shine!

I drizzled fresh lime juice on each filet before the salsa. Otherwise did it exactly as described except I didn't follow precise quantities. Squeezing the water out of frozen fish is very important. 

It was delicious and is our favorite way to make fish now!

The family rates all my dishes and this made it into the top 3! It was quick, simple, and reasonably priced. I think I figured out why some reviewers are complaining about it being watery; my young daughter doesn't like spicy food so I made hers separately without salsa. The main dish had a lot of liquid in the bottom, but her's was dry. I believe it's the salsa and not the fish that's making it "soupy". These are the changes I made: I put the cod on a bed of black beans and baked it with cilantro salsa for 12 minutes. I removed it and added a blend of shredded medium cheddar and jalapeno jack cheeses and topped it with crushed LIME flavored tortilla chips, then popped it back in the oven for the final 3 minutes! WE ALL LOVED IT!

this was really good. i used haddock, and because i'm always calculating nutritional values, i made the measurements more specific: i used 2 oz. of grated cheddar, and 28 grams (it's a serving size!) of white tortilla chips. when i put it on the table, i forgot about the sour cream and avocado, and it was quite good without, but once i added them it was delicious!

These were easy and good.  I didn't measure, but I'm sure I used less salsa & cheese.  Served with warm corn tortillas, these made delicious fish tacos.

Both my laziness (looking for something easy and without a lot of clean up) and my craving for Mexican food lead me to this scrumptious dish.  I used catfish (because that's what I had), and had to bake it for about 25 minutes, but made per directions other than that and couldn't have been happier with the result.  Looked and tasted terrific.  Thank Christy!

OMG!!! It was so good I made it twice in a week because my fiance loved it. I have to say, it is one of the best ways of making fish, we tried it with Salmon and Tilapia and it was great with both.

I've made this dish a couple of times.  It is a great recipe for work nights, as it is easy to assemble, and the cook time is short.  I have found it definately works best with a "stronger" flavor of fish such as Mahi Mahi, Thresher Shark, or something of that nature.  Just to experiment, the second time I rubbed the fillets down with lime juice, sprinkled with onion powder, and cumin (my favorite mexican spice) then topped with cheese.  I also switched up to the blue chips to add a little color dimension.  It isn't dinner at the Ritz, but a solid recipe, especially for those who are not crazy about fish.  But do not skimp of the quality when it comes to the ingredients, or you won't enjoy the end result nearly as much.

I skipped over this recipe several times because it just seemed so boring. I enjoy making complex flavor recipes. But i needed something quick and easy for dinner last night so decided to give it a shot.  I salt and peppered the fillets.  Coated with Spicy mayo, then topped with salsa and cheese.  Served with tortilla chips and guacamole.  It was amazing. Still cant believe how good it was and so simple.  Next time I'll probably throw on some fresh cilantro.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly and used cod, but next time I think I'll use mahi mahi. I think I'll also squeeze fresh lime juice all over the fish before putting the salsa on. I baked for 10 minutes, and then put on the cheese and crushed chips, and baked for another 5 minutes or so. My fillets were thick and cooked perfectly. I served this with Baked Tostitos Scoop chips, sour cream, avacado, and black beans. My husband had the idea to put a little fish inside the scoop chip, top with a little sour cream, avacado, and black beans. It was soooo good that way and I'll serve it that way from now on. We are using the left overs in a fish burrito tomorrow. Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Very good and super fast to make. I would have some extra chips next time to sprinkle on top at the dinner table. The chips that baked on the fish were crunchy at first and then began to get soft. The crunch added a nice contrast.

LOVED this! I made this a week ago and have been craving it ever since. My husband and 2- and 4-yr-olds loved it too. And it was so easy! Will definitely add this to our dinner rotation. Thanks so much for this recipe!

WOW! I did not believe the other reviewers when they said how easy and good this is---but they are right. I will make this often. My husband usually does not like it when you smother a fish with other flavors but in this case he loved it. I used flounder and it worked fine. Thank you so much for the recipe.

In an effort to eat healthier with fewer calories and to add more fish to my diet, I came across this recipe.  I am tempted not to review it because I didn't really follow it completely, but this recipe inspired what I cooked (Plus, I want the review for myself). I seasoned tilapia with Cajun seasoning and then topped it with the salsa.  I baked it for 15 minutes and added the Cheddar cheese after taking it out of the oven.  It was delicious and had a kick to it.  I plan to use the left-overs for fish tacos tomorrow night.

Excellent!  We love chicken cooked with salsa and cheese, but I never thought to do fish this way.  I discovered my salsa had gone bad, so I subbed a can of Ro-Tel instead.  I also salted the fish before topping it.  I noticed that the pictures all show what I consider to be "tortilla chips" rather than Fritos, which are what I interpret "corn chips" to mean.  I used Fritos and was very pleased with the results.  We'll definitely have this again.  Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this recipe!  Fast, easy, delicous!  Have made it many times...am making it for dinner right now, actually.   I stick pretty close to the recipe, except I don't measure...just pour on salsa until the fish is covered.  I love cheese so I put as much on as I'm in the mood for.  Same with the tortilla chips - just grab them out of the bag, crush them over the fish and pop it all in the oven.  I agree that it can get a little watery in the dish, but it doesn't really affect the fish.  I think you could strain the salsa a bit if it bothers you, but I don't really care.  Great to make for a last minute dinner.  I always have these ingredients on hand.  Frozen guacamole thawed makes a good topper too if you don't have fresh avacado.   Thanks for sharing such a quick and easy recipe!

Overall this is a pretty good recipe; very fast & easy. I suggest you season the fish fillets prior to adding the salsa otherwise it will be a little bland; I used Southwest Ancho sear-n-crust rub to season mine. Draining the salsa if it is loose or watery is a great idea as well. If you are using a thick fish such as cod, you may want to leave it in the oven for at least 20 minutes.

This was a very good recipe.  I decided not to do the chips o top and served the fish in soft taco shells with the sour cream and avacado.  I also spiced it up with some chili powder and garlic.  I served it with the mexican rice recipe from this site and it was a really quick weeknight meal.

Simple and wonderful recipe.  I used peach Salsa (you can add some chopped canned fruit if need be) and monteray jack cheese.  Our dinner guest, my hubby and I had a lip smacking good time with our meal.  Thank you very much!

My husband made this for me and it was so good. He served it with rice and black beans. However, he made it later and left out the avocado and sour cream, which left it tasting very bland!

It was very good, my husband liked it very much. I didn't have chips nor avocado at the time I was making this, I pre-cooked some spanish rice instead & put it at the bottom of my baking dish before placing the egg-dipped cod on top of rice. It turned out very elegant and extremely flavorful.

This was really good. I'm not a big sour cream or avocodo eater so I tried the fish both with it and with out it and I got to tell you the sour cream and avocado just made this dish, Very very good!

I made this last night, and my husband immediately said it was a keeper!  I cooked the fish in a skillet with lemon pepper for 2 or 3 minutes, then followed the recipe.  I did use multigrain tortilla chips and 2% cheese and just added a thin line of sour cream with a dollop of spicy guacamole in the middle.  DELICIOUS, healthy, and quick for a weeknight dinner!

Couldn't be easier! I sprinkled some cumin and a little chili powder on the fish (I used tilapia), and baked for 10 minutes before adding the salsa and reduced-fat cheese. It comes out perfectly ever time, and even my husband (who is notoriously hard to feed) loves it! Thanks!

Loved it. Loved it.  I did take some of the others advice and seasoned the fish first, removed some of the excess liquid from the salsa and put the cheese and crumbs on during the last 10 or 15 minutes of baking.  Husband also loved it.  We used cod filets and this will surely go into regular rotation in my house.

Great weeknight dinner.  The salsa plays a big role in this since the fish is so mild, make sure you use one that you really like.  I'm going to try this with other types of fish.  Thanks!

My husband hates fish so I thought I would try this recipe.  He loved it!  He asked that I make it again, but this time we use the fish for fish tacos, so we are trying that tonight!  I couldn't believe he liked it as much as he did... but we did need to cook it for 20 minutes rather than the suggested time.

Very good with cod.  I think homemade salsa makes all the difference, as it is more flavorful and less watery.  I made mine with peppers, grape tomatoes, jalapeño, cilantro, garlic, beans, and corn in about 10 minutes.  I would also suggest waiting until the last few minutes to add the chips and cheese.

I was a little hesitant on making this...sounded like something a college kid would make up, but I'm glad I did. This was delicious! The acidity in the salsa took away any fishy taste and it was sooooo easy. We've made this twice - once with trout and once with redfish. I bet this would be good rolled up in a flour tortilla...I think will try that next time :)

I thought this recipe was just ok. Besides scaling it down I followed it exactly. I had to put under the broiler for a few minutes because the chips got soggy. I don't know if it was the salsa or the chips, but it seemed really salty to us. Although it was an easy recipe, I won't be making it again. Sorry.

I made this recipe with haddock and it came out awesome!!!!  Nice & moist too.
I did bake it for 1/2 hr. instead of 15 mins.  I also left out the avacado but did put some sour cream on top.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! I will definitely use this recipe again when eating fish. 
Thanks for sharing!!!

My family really enjoyed this, and it was so easy to make!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because cod is just not high on my list of fish, but otherwise it was very good.

Mexican fish?  I can't quite imagine these ingredients working with fish.  So I made it using boneless chicken breast instead of fish.  It turned out fantastic!  Baked at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour...perfect.  Be sure to top with sour cream and advocado - - these complete the dish.

I don't like any fish dish that tastes fishy, so after reading some of the reviews that complained about that, I was a little afraid to try this recipe.  I used fresh cod, and it was great!  It must depend on the fish you use, because my husband and I both loved this dish, and it was so easy!  I used Fritos and did not add any salt in the preparation - the corn flavor added was very good.  I'll definitely make this again.

For ease and yumminess, I give it a 5. It doesn't seem to matter what white fish you use and I have even used frozen fish.  All I did was extend the cooking time. Thanks for the great recipe!

So fast and easy and delicious...this is probably my best "find" on allrecipes. The fish you use definitely makes a difference, so buy fresh! I generally skip the avocado and serve this like a taco, with tortillas, tomatoes and lettuce off to the side. Mmm.

Easy, easy, easy!  I sprayed my baking dish with non-stick cooking spray used medium salsa, and wow tortilla chips to lower the fat.  A must make.

This recipe was great. I made it as a special occasion dinner for my husband (I'm NOT a big fish fan). He raved about it, so I tried it. It was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making it again.

I really love this recipe. My husband wrinkled his nose when I started making it, and I admit I was pretty scared too. But it was great. Our only changes were that we made homemade salsa and put some of Dave's Ultimate Guacamole on top (recipe on thise site). It was fantastic. My husband who is a firefighter took the recipe to work. It is easy enough for him and his co-workers and will even fill up those hungry men.

GORGEOUS.  I didn't follow the measurements.  I used two large fillets for my husband and muyself and just used a jar of hot salsa and loads of cheese under the sour cream....What a nice surprise!  My hubby loved it even though he was a bit suspicious of using mexican tastes over fish.  A YUMMY keeper.

Not a keeper for my family, but everyone ate it ok.  I think if you were really fond of both fish and salsa it might be a hit.  I used orange roughy.

This is my favorite way to cook fish!  I've tried it with many different types of white fish - my family's favorite is orange roughy with a peach pineapple salsa (safeway makes a good one)

I don't like fish, but I made this for my husband and he liked it.  I just used some frozen fish fillets and layered them and cooked it a bit longer.  I skipped the avacado.  My husband said he liked the contrast between the crunchiness of the corn chips with the rest of the ingredients.  I liked it because it smelled great and didn't leave a fish smell in the house - just the salsa and corn chips.  It was very quick and easy.  I think it was such a nice change with surprising ingredients for a fish dish.  I would definitely make this again.

I found this to be delicious, healthy (except for the, ahem, sour cream and avocado...), and super-easy to prepare! Cod was looking a little sad at the market, so I subbed in Red Snapper fillets which were thicker and took longer to cook -- closer to 25 mins. We ate these by ripping off pieces of tortilla and wrapping them around a bit of fish, avocado, black beans, sour cream and a squeeze of lime. Yum.

This was very delicious, I have made it twice already, the first time with homemade salsa (very hot) and the second with my bf's suggestion of using pineapple mango salsa which was just ok to me but he loved it, I also used a combination of cheddar and monterey jack cheese.

Excellent.  Very quick and easy to prepare.  More importantly, it is sure to please the entire family.  Plus, you can do little variations in terms of toppings (green onions, olives, cilantro, etc.) and dress it up by using fancier salsa.  We also liked it with Red Snapper.  Use the whole fish and extend the cooking time accordingly and this becomes a great dish for weeknight guests!

Nice change from regular fish dishes. I used orange roughy instead of cod and added green onions to the top of the casserole. Really liked the avocado flavor and texture with this dish.

I was skeptical about the Fritos topping but it was delicious.  The sliced avocados really made it too.  The best part is, nothing really needed to be measured.  Just dump stuff on however it looks good to you.

My whole family thought this was wonderful!  They raved about it.  I used frozen orange roughy and black bean salsa from Trader Joe's.  It was amazingly easy to make.  Served with warm flour tortillas, homemade guacomole and "Best Spanish Rice" from this site.  A fantastic, beautiful meal!

I made this recipe using chicken.  It turned out great! I also added fresh cilantro and put it between the salsa and cheese.  I think it adds a little something extra!

I thought this dish would have been better with a different kind of fish, like catfish or orange ruffy (sp?).  The cod just tasted really fishy and it didn't mix with the mexican taste too well.

I was just going through my "recipe box" and saw this one. It's been a while since I've made it, but I do remember how great it was!! I have never gotten my 7 year old to eat fish as easily as with this recipe! In fact, my whole family loved it and boy, am I glad I came across it again. Its on next weeks menu for sure!

Quick, easy, delicious, and unique!  The crushed chips add good texture.  My husband could not stop raving about this.  I used tilapia instead of the cod, and it turned out great.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  My family loved it and have asked for it again.  I do not use the sour cream or avocado.  Just the salsa alone adds so much flavor.  I also tried it with orange roughy and it was tastier than the cod.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is so simple.  You really don't have to measure anything.  Just pour the salsa over the fish, sprinkle on cheese and corn chips and your done!  Easy enough to make for one person or a large crowd!!!!!  Thanks!

I use those catfish nuggets you can find in the seafood section of the store, which work pretty well.  This is a healthier way to eat catfish than fried catfish!  I like this dish so much I actually FOLLOW the recipe.

I had to give this recipe 5 stars.  First of all, it is delicious.  It requires very few ingredients, is a cinch to make (even my fiance who is NOT a cooking enthusiast can make this) and my 14 month old son loves it!  In fact, it's the only way he actually accepts to eat fish!

This dish definitely wasn't as good as all the other reviews say.  I love fish but this needed more seasoning -- salt or something.  I was very disappointed.

Just tried this recipe for the first time and it was wonderful!  I used catfish which worked out great.  My husband and five year old son loved it and I put a milder sauce on my son's piece of fish.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.

I used chicken breast instead of fish, cooked for 40 minutes, topped with cheese last 10 minutes of baking and it was awesome!!  So easy and fast and the chicken came out juicy!

One of the best yet! So easy (I love easy!) and so tasty. My tongue stayed a tad hot. I'd suggest the mildest salsa. It is also a very attractive dish. I waited until I could get a very good price on cod. I used only a pound (not one and one-half pounds) and it turned out fine!

Being a Bostonian, I've had a lot of fish dishes, and usually don't like fish with stuff piled on top.  But I was pleasantly surprised by how moist and delicious this dish was.  The ingredients do not overpower the fish, and the topping gives it a nice crunch.  Even my picky teenager enjoyed it. And best of all, it's quick and easy to make!

I had some doubts, but was pleasantly surprised.  I had some cod in the freezer and wanted to experiment with some recipes.  Stumbled on this and the reviews were great, so I went for it.  Corn chips and cod.  Weird, but it sure works.  And the quantities... ratios... were spot on.  Right amount of fish, cheese, salsa and chips.  I don't like avocado, so I left that off.  If you're wondering about this, don't worry.  Just make it.  Your tummy will thank you!!!

I loved the recipe.  I used Mexican four-blend cheese instead of cheddar cheese.  Also , I crushed the corn chips very fine, and then topped the fish with them.  I found I needed to bake the cod for 18 minutes.  Served it with rice pilaf and black beans.  Can't wait to make it again.  It came together in minutes.  Going to serve it to the next lucky dinner guests.

I made this for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it. I used talapia instead of cod and I made a white rice and fiesta corn mixture for my side.

I loved this recipe!  Next time, I'll double it.  Served with rice, black beans and corn, with sour cream and sliced avocado.  Next time I'll double it -- great way to eat more fish!

This turned out delicious!  I used frozen (but thawed)Haki fillets from Costco, Cantina style On the Border salsa and On the Border chips- crushed fine. This was quick and easy.  I did place them too close together at first and needed to seperate them and cook a little longer, but after they cooked properly, the flavor was wonderful. It really was a quick, easy recipe.

Overall this dish had good flavor and was easy to make. I had a problem with the fish bring watery and it had a weird consistency. Next time I'll try with fresh fish instead of frozen.

Super easy to make, served this tonight in au gratin dishes with blue corn chips on the side, prepared exactly as written.  I'm not a huge fish fan but this was okay for me and I ate most of mine. Hubby loves fish, said this was all right but wouldn't call it a favorite.  Then he said the fish was done too much so maybe it was my fault although I only cooked for the 15 mins called for. I'll make it again sometime and cut back on cooking time some. Thanks for posting.

After years of trying new recipes from allrecipes.com, week after week...I would rate this recipe the absolute most efficient for the time and effort you put in. The easiest, no-fuzz recipe I've ever had to put together and cook. And the results are unbelievably good.  I would make this dish for anyone I know and would want to impress, great intense flavors that would please mostly everyone. I LOVE THIS RECIPE. Will be using for years to come.

Super easy recipe using on-hand ingredients.  I used halibut and patted it dry as suggested before topping it.  Served with plain Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream) and avocados.  Very good!  Reheated the next day in the microwave for 1.5 minutes on 70% power, and it was still good.

I used tilapia. Sprinkled about a tbsp of taco seasoning over it and baked for about 5-10 min before dumping on the rest for about 10 min.  I used garden salsa sun chips instead of corn chips.  My avocado was not ripe, so I did not like it tonight, but not the recipe's fault.  I would try it again with a riper avocado, or some guacamole.  Maybe add some corn and black beans next time.

I use this recipe frequently.  It is so easy and everyone loves it.  I use striped bass which is thicker than cod so I cook it 20-25 minutes.

Wow! Such an easy recipe to make and no need for measuring. No doubt that this would work with almost any fish and chicken. The cooking time was a bit longer for me.

This was so simple, but great.  My husband loved it and he doesn't do fish.  I did have to bake it closer to 25 minutes, oh well.  We will have this often.

I left off the cheese and corn chips and it was phenomenal. I did add a small handful of chopped fresh cilantro. I've made this recipe as written before and it is still 5-stars. I just prefer a little more healthy approach. Enjoy :-)

I was all ready to prepare this with cod, but then realized that my fresh cod was a bit smelly. Instead of bagging my dinner idea completely, I decided to make this recipe using chicken. I also couldn't find any corn chips, so I used cheesy Doritos. Lastly, I had some leftover Mexican rice from dinner two days beforehand and threw it into the baking dish. It was very tasty! I will file this recipe away and use cod as written some day soon. I am determined to try this recipe as it was originally written. However, the teeny additions were yummy!

so easy, and totally delicious! I accidentally put 1 cup of crushed corn chips on top instead of 1/2 cup, but it turned out fantastic. And, I took another reviewer's advice and put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to make the chips really crispy. Highly recommend!

I was really nervous with this recipe just because fish and cheese to me don't really go together. But this turned out awesome. Would def make it again. I shared it with my parents who eat fish alot. Great recipe. Also works well with chicken too!

So simple and so delicious.  And the low calorie count is a bonus.  The spicier the salsa the better, and we use our favorite Juanita's corn chips.  I have a gas oven that runs on the cooler side, so I baked it for 25 minutes at 425.  It even makes great leftovers to heat up in the microwave the next day.

This was excellent. The only thing I did different is I baked it from frozen since I forgot to take out the morning of. Increased bake time to 30 minutes instead of 15. Will absolutely make this again!

This is one of the easiest fool-proof ways to change up a fish dish.   Make sure you use a salsa you know you like, and don't be afraid to use the HOT salsa; the extra heat does not come out in the finished dish.  I prepared this once using mild salsa on one half of the dish, and hot salsa on the other half.  In a taste test, people could not distinguish between the two heats; however I think the hotter salsa adds just a bit more flavour.  This is certainly a keeper recipe; everyone loves it.

Not bad at all!  I used frozen fish sticks bc I'm trying to use them up; otherwise I probably wouldve used tilapia or something similar.  this worked surprisingly well, even with that sub.  I baked the fish for 10 minutes, then covered with the remaining ingredients and baked for another 20 minutes.   I forgot about the avocado, but it was still a nice little main dish.  We ate it with saffron rice and mixed veggies.  This is a nice, quick dish that is reallly good.  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!  I used Tilapia and made the 4 serving version.  It was done at 20 mins.  The avocado tasted really good on top.  We skipped the sour cream.

Easy and everyone ate it but, nothing special. Won't make it again without making some changes.

Easy and very delicious!  My family was very impressed with the taste and eye-appeal of this dish.  This will be a recipe I will continue to use and I am looking forward to trying other kinds of fish such as halibut and salmon.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Simple and delicious.  My avocado wasn't ripe so I chopped fresh cilantro and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  This one's a keeper and perfect for a night with little time to cook.

This was surprisingly good! I really wasn't too sure about melting cheese on fish but I had some leftover salsa and tortilla chip crumbs to use up so I gave it a try. Wow! I cooked mine for 30 mins as several others suggested. I didn't have the avocado or the sour cream but it really didn't need it. A very good quick, easy, and inexpensive meal. I served it with Cilantro Lime Rice. If I make this again I would go with the same rice side but add a black bean corn salad too.

Update: I just tried this again using tilapia and extra homemade salsa. Worked well.

Really good and easy.  I used fresh rockfish and added some jack cheese in addition to the cheddar and served over rice.  I used a can of Herdez salsa casera, which is pretty mild but chunky, and added chopped little green onions.  I dried the fish well and after adding the salsa, drained the excess liquid.  I will add cilantro next time.  My husband loved it and he says he is not a huge fish eater!  Will make again and recommend to others.

Boyfriend says, "This can go in the repertoire of things you bake on a regular basis."  'Nuff said there, as my boyfriend certainly doesn't suggest that I make things he doesn't like more than once.  I love that this was both quick and easy to make.  I love Mexican flavors, so I sprinkled the fish with some cilantro, cumin, chili powder, and a wee bit of garlic.  Just to give it some extra kick.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make this again, perhaps with different types of fish also.

Delicious, simple and fairly healthy dinner to make with only a few ingredients.  I used Tilapia and added a little tomato juice (2 Tbs. or so) to the baking dish to keep it from drying out.  Used some black bean salsa I had on hand, tossed a little shredded cheese on top, popped it in the oven and VOILA!  I left out the corn chips and sour cream as we don't care for either ingredient, then garnished with cilantro and the husband insisted on seconds.

Good, easy, and quick.  Healthy too if you use low fat cheese and use the chip topping sparingly.

i prefered it when the corn chips were finer (formed more of a crust.) otherwise, it was really good. and simple to make! husband said he would prefer taco sauce instead of salsa and forego the chips altogether. i also cooked it for about 30 mins. the fish was not overcooked. i broiled for a couple of minutes at the end to try and reduce some of the liquid in the pan. pat the fish dry!!

I used green salsa, which gave it a more citrusy flavor, and it was great.  i used jalapeno almond cheese (dairy intolerant) and it turned out fantastic.  not sure why it got so watery in the dish but i guess it keeps the fish moist.  also, something made it a bit salty (maybe the salsa, or chips).  next time, salt free chips.  overall it is a great recipe, becuase it's healthy and not fishy.

This is an AWESOME recipe! Made this acccording to ingredients listed with the change of using Tilapia instead of Cod.  They turned out perfect!  Made this for my son's 25th birthday party and everyone loved it. This is one recipe that I will continue to make.

We are a family of fish eaters, but we didn't like this dish.  It was very bland and the kids only wanted to eat the fritos and cheese off the top.  I would not make this again.

This was fantastic and super easy to make. Really a delicious meal. I added crushed garlic, lemon juice, and a sliced jalepeno pepper to the olive oil in the bottom of the pan. I cooked the fish 20 mins and then turned the broiler on to crisp up the fritos for another five minutes. Really, really delicious.

Delicious and so easy to make! I used tilapia instead of cod, and will probably make with chicken too. There is no need to measure the ingredients, which makes it that much quicker. Minimal clean up, just one pan to wash! Will definitely make this many times again!

Very, very good. I used swai/basa (a mild white fish) and my kids and husband loved it. For extra kick, I made it with Monterrey Jack Cheese instead of cheddar. And it took 25 minutes for the fish to flake. A definite keeper.

OMG!! This recipe is a keeper.  Made it tonight and it was delish. I followed the recipe exactly as posted and served with corn and black beans.  It was so tasty and a great twist on fish.      Try this recipe out, it will not let you down.

I used talapia (had on hand)also lined the bottom of the dish with 3 cups cooked rice. Squeezed lime over rice, layered sliced lime over rice and some of the salsa.  Squeezed more lime juice over fish then followed the rest of the recipe. My husband has rated this in his top 5 favorites!

This was GREAT and I will definitely do it again. For being so simple it really put off some flavor. Great for non fish fans because I used tilapia for the dish and it hardly tasted like fish when I was done and I eat tilapia a LOT!

Very easy..no measuring required. I used a bigger pan than recommended..and found that I had no water sitting in it like others complained about. I also cooked this casserole for 30 minutes. I paired it with Mexican Rice (from this site). I will be making this again. Thank you.

Awesome! Will make again! Have decided to be stingy with my '5 star' ratings, but this one came close.  Very unique. Very easy! Served with guacamole and low-fat sour cream. Used Talapia and a mix of cheddar, mozz and Mont. Jack cheeses.  Thanks for this brilliant idea that we will forever more call our 'fish nachos'!!!!

What a great and EASY recipe....we love fish tacos and this was the speedy version.  I used a little less cheese and topped with baked chips to lighten the recipe up a bit.  Topped with cilantro for a little extra something at the end and served with Spanish Rice--- this will definitely be a staple in my household!

A true family-pleaser! My husband, two teenaged kids and I LOVED it. I served mine with guacamole and a dressing made out of sour cream combined with salsa. The tastes were fabuous. I had thought that the fish/tortilla chip combo might have turned out to be a strange one, but it was terrific! I can highly recommend this quick, easy and delicious recipe. Thanks for posting it!

This turned out fabulous. Much better than expected - I paired it with a copycat Chipolte Lime/Cilantro rice and the combined flavours were out of this world!! I added cumin and lemon pepper to the fish before covering with black bean and corn salsa. I couldn't believe how good it tasted for something so easy to prepare. A definite hit - will try again and try to impress my mom with it next time!

I made this last night with Tilapia instead of cod.  My boyfriend didn't even know it was fish (which he hates). I first, cooked it in a pan with a little olive oil for about 7 minutes on medium-low heat and then placed in the oven at 400 for 5 minutes.  Right before I took it out of the oven, I broiled the fish for 2 minutes to get the chips really crunchy.  It was awesome!

It frustrates me to no end that the people in my family are leery of "unusual" foods. Every time I make something they have never heard of or tasted before, it takes an act of GOD to get them to eat it without a preconceived notion of how much they are not going to like it. So, I stooped to trickery. 

I made each of them taste it but would NOT tell them what it was. I put it on a fork, said, "Taste this." They bit into it and LOVED it. When I told them the name, they were extremely surprised. 

This is a very tasty dish that even those with "normal" palates will enjoy. 

I made this exact to the recipe. Not sure if I will change the recipe up at all (I always end up doing that) but it was delicious AS IS.

This is my go-to meal when I'm pressed for time.  It's SO quick and easy, and it's hard to find healthy recipes that fit that description.  (I use reduced-fat cheese and baked corn chips.  Still great!)

Didn't really like this, but I think I should have used chunkier salsa. A couple things went wrong with the way I made it, I think, and it just didn't come out as I had imagined.

I tried the Mexican Baked Fish recipe tonight. I didn't have the corn chips or the sour cream, but it was delicious and very easy. I fixed a side salsa of onion, tomato and avacado which went over the fish and also atop our rice. My husband rated it a 5!

This was such a yummy & quick meal for when you don't have much time to spare. I didn't bother measuring anything in a recipe this simple. Just put as much or as little as you want depending on what you like! I used haddock instead of cod & it was still soo yummy!! Even my hubby who's not much of a fish fan said it was good!!

This is such a super simple recipe. I used tilapia instead of cod. Like everyone else I didn't measure the ingredients I just layered them over the fish. The only addition I made to this dish was to add some chopped green onions on top of the cheese and chips prior to baking. It really doesn't get much easier than this. I baked the fish for 25 mins and broiled the top for another 3 mins.

I am not a fish lover, but try to find things I can tolerate for my husband and because it is pretty healthy.  I have to say that I loved this recipe!  I am going to put in on our menu of rotating dinners.  I used reduced fat cheese and left the avacado/sour cream off.  Was wonderful and actually pretty healthy.

delightful.  i had it baking in 15 minutes after being gone all day.  i did the quick method....spray pan, add fish (patted out moisture), salsa,cheese... cook add avacado.  serve with salad.  i used cod.  big hit.  great on a busy day.  I just need to keep fish on hand.  love it!  (I tried again with tilapia and didn't like it.  avacado makes a huge difference too-use it)

Easy to prepare and very tasty! My husband is not a big fan of seafood, and even he ate most of his. Will make again.

I made this with tilapia.  We weren't very impressed.  It was just okay.  Served w/refried beans, taco rice and the 'guacamole' recipe from this site (which is fabulous, by the way!).  I likely won't make this recipe again.  Thanks anyway.

This is excellent and so easy to make. The salsa you use is really the important part. I used Rosa Mexicana Chile Pasilla de Oaxaca salsa, which I bought at Whole Foods. It gave it an overall smoky flavor and the right amount of heat. I chose tilapia as a base, and it worked perfectly. Topped with some finely  grated organic sharp white Cheddar cheese, crushed organic Tostito's blue corn chips and a few avocado slices, this really made a great meal. I will definitely be making this one again.

Very nice! I did the following modifications - added some cream of mushroom soup for creaminess, cumin to the salsa and marinated the fish for half hour before putting some chips, cheese on and sticking it in the oven. The fish came out delicious!. Thanks for this simple, yummy recipe.

I found this to be a very good recipe.  I'm pregnant and am very picky with any type of fish, but I did enjoy this one.  I waited to put the cheese and chips on until the last 10 min. (it took 30 min. to cook), used tilapia instead of cod, and served it with corn, black beans, and guacamole.

Excellent!  Used Stokes Green Chili Sauce instead of salsa and topped with sliced green onions and black olives.  Garnished with sour cream and avacado.  Came out alot like enchiladas.  My 2 year old just loved it!  Super easy and fast to make.  A keeper for sure!

We really enjoyed this dish, though it came out somewhat watery. The next time I make it I will drain some of the liquid from the salsa.  Given the small amount of work, it was really tasty.   Not exactly lo cal but if your looking for something fast and easy this is it.

Nice recipe.  Very easy and simple ingredients. The children enjoyed it, tho the salsa I used was a little spicy.  Next time I think I will use a green salsa and monterey jack cheese.  Served it with a rice and spinach mixture.  A bed of fresh spinach would be nice under the fish to cook and soak up some of the liquid.

This was a nice change from the usual lemon and butter that we do. My boyfriend loved it! Although it was very tasty the fish itself was kinda bland. I used a can of the Hot Ro-Tel instead of salsa (love that stuff)Next time I would probably season the fish prior to putting the toppings on.

cooks down about 2 inches on both sides of pan but a really good meal.  i served it with rice, black beans, avacodo, and tomatos.  My Dad who is not the fondest of seafood in general liked it as well as my 2yr old.  Empty plates and dishes all the way around

I was very impressed with this recipe, easy and tasty!  I had all needed ingredients in my kitchen and used tilapia, my favorite "everyday" fish.  Cheese on fish?  I would not have done it on my own but it worked great!

My family (at least everyone but me) are not big fish eaters.  They loved this recipe.  It wasn't the same old plain jane fish.  It was nice to spice it up a bit for them.

I made this with orange roughy, as cod was not available.  It was very quick to put together and was delicious.

Not a good recipe in our house.  I've done something very similar to this for chicken and then it is delicious, but the flavors just did NOT combine with fish.  It was strange and we didn't finish it.

If Hubby and I could give this 6 stars, we would.  I divided the recipe in half, and used cheap old pollack fillets.  For my 1/2 recipe I used 1/3 cup picante sauce (that was what was opened in the fridge), decreased the cheese to 1-1/2 oz. (used extra-sharp cheddar), and did increase the chips to 1/2 cup of crushed white corn tortilla chips.  Followed a reviewer's suggestion and did sprinkle the prepared baking dish with 1/8 cup of minute rice before adding the fish.  Seriously delicious with plain old white rice and a green salad.

This was OK....The cooking time was way too short.  The fish was still raw....Once I cooked it for an additional 15 minutes, it was an average dish.  Will not make again.

This was delicious and so easy to prepare.  We are trying to eat more fish, so this is a great recipe to have.  I wasn't sure whether I should have used Fritos or the Tostitos corn chips, so I went with the Fritos--which I thought would entice my kids to try this, but they wouldn't.  Oh well, all the more for my husband and I.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wasn't sure about this one when I first read it.  But it is truly quick and wonderful.  My husband is not a big fish fan, but now he actually asks me to make this.  We use tilapia instead of cod.

I was a bit skeptical about this.  Fish with salsa and cheese?  But after reading all the great reviews and seeing how simple it was, I had to try it.  I took other people's suggestions and used tilapia fillets.  The result was a delicious dish that took hardly any time to make.  I didn't even bother with the avacado and sour cream I'll definitely make this again next time with some green onions and black beans.  Thanks Christine!

THIS WAS NOT BAD. I USED TILAPIA WITH THIS RECIPE BECAUSE I THINK THAT TASTES LESS FISHY. I WILL PROBABLY MAKE THIS AGAIN WHEN IM IN THE MOOD FOR FISH.

I have been on AllRecipes for a long time but just started reviewing meals.  Hands down this is one of our favorites.  It is so easy to make and very tasty!  We actually don't even bother with the chip, avacado, or sour cream.  The dish really does not need anything extra.

Quite easy and very tasty!  Two key factors:  get GOOD QUALITY salsa and corn chips and be sure not to overcook the fish.  Garnish with some cilantro and diced green onion and dig in!  Yummy!

Very good recipe for a simple dish.  I have a freezer stocked with Alaskan halibut from a fishing trip and this was a fun new recipe.  Once the fish was ready, I chopped some tomatoes, onions, olives and lettuce, shredded cheese and made a soft-taco bar.  I used a fork to chunk up the fish.  It was wonderful!  We will definitely have this again. TIP: Use a really good salsa or even better a pico de gallo - cheap salsa would probably ruin the light taste of the fish.

I'm always looking for a new way to prepare fish and this was a good one.  Served on a bed of mixed greens that I tossed with remaining cheese and salsa.  A complete, nutritious meal in itself.

My boyfriend and I made this last night. We rarely make fish dishes other than salmon, but this was very easy to prepare and really delicious. We followed the recipe exactly except for the avocado.  We were both skeptical about the corn chips, but it ended up being the best thing about the dish.

This is a really great idea for a quick, easy, delicious meal!  I used haddock, and I used a lowfat Mexican cheese blend and baked chips to keep it low-fat.  I didn't put any seasonings on the fish before I put on the salsa, so I used hot salsa to give it lots of flavor.  I'm not a big avocado or guacamole fan, so I just put a dollop of fat-free sour cream on the side.  I will definitely make this on a regular basis!

Wow. I tried this dish with Halibut and thought for sure given such an easy recipe there's no way it could be as good as they say, but I was wrong. It was fantastic and I will definitely make it again. And I recommend using frito style corn chips (traderjoe's are great) instead of corn tortilla chips... Yum.

Really quick and easy!  I used a tomatillo salsa.  Unfortunately, I used a red snapper filet that was exceedingly fishy in flavor, so it made the dish a little less palatable than it would have been otherwise.  Nonetheless, I am looking forward to trying this recipe again with another cut of fish, maybe mahi mahi or tilapia.  Quicky, easy, tasty, and my little girl loved it, so it passes with high marks on all measures.  Thank you for sharing.

YUUUUUMMMMM!  I've been eyeing this for months and finally tried it...hubby doesbn't like fish but had seconds!  I had to look around the kitchen and make sure I hadn't forgotten anything before I put it in the oven; superb outcome for such a quick and easy recipe!  Thanks a bunch...this is a keeper!

This was great!  I used hot salsa to give the dish a nice bite.  Also when I went to to fish monger there was no fresh cod so I just grabbed a firm white fish and it turned out fine.

I am definately in the minority on this one!  Was skeptical to begin with but couldn't resist with all the great reviews.  It was not horrible, but it just didn't do anything for me or my husband.  Won't be making it again.

Really fast, easy recipe. Good for after a long work day because it takes almost no effort. Taste is pretty good - like nachos over fish. I wouldn't serve this for company, though, because it's very basic.

This recipe is great! except that i used salt and pepper to season the fish before anything else. And then i forgot that im supposed to use cheddar cheese and used mozeralla. Still taste pretty good. My boyfriend loves it! And trust me. He is not huge on mexican food.

The taste and ease of this recipe are inversely proportional.  It was very easy to prepare, and incredibly tasteful.  I used Canadian chard cheddar, and made spanish rice on the side.  Went really well with light bodied red wine.

My husband doesn't like fish, but he loved this version. Of course, he likes Mexican food! The great thing about this recipe is that your house will NOT smell like fish! It's a great tasting recipe!

I've made this a few times now and it gets great reviews everytime.  I don't think it can get much easier than this.  I used orange roughy and liked it much better than cod!  I didn't use avocados but it was still really tasty.

I could not believe how easy this was to prepare..when I took it out of the oven, it looked as if I had been cooking all afternoon. I served it w/ spanish rice and I used all of the ingredients that the recipe called for. Tortilla chips add the perfect texture. Thank you!

I used the fresh salsa from the refrigerated section and threw it under the broiler after the initial cooking time.  This was incredible...the avacado is a must.

it was totally yummy...but I washed the fish with salt to rid it of the fishy smell...and this resulted in the fish being too salty..so,make sure u wash off all the salt.it tasted great with the chicken with rice also, found on this website!!

I have tried this with both cod and tilapia.  Both were very good, but I prefer the cod.  I love this recipe, and my VERY picky 3-year-old even likes it.  He has renamed it "Taco Fish".

I was expecting more from this recipe from the previous reviews.  Husband and I are not to crazy about it, definately will not be making it again. Fish was soggy and it just tasted like "heat and serve" food.  Threw most of it out.

As I write this, our family JUST finished devouring this meal.. I found the recipe today and made it for dinner.  The entire family loved it and, believe me, it's so rare to find a recipe all four of our children agree on.  It was exceptionally quick and easy to prepare with ingredients I almost always have on hand. What more could you want.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my husband who loves fish, but is very picky. He loved it and requests it frequently now. I even tried the dish with tilapia fish -- and it was still delicious. Very simple to prepare!!!

Although the flavor of the dish was indeed good, it totally masked the flavor of the fish, and we felt that it wasn't the best recipe for a good piece of fish.  Super fast and easy though.  I wonder whether chicken could be cooked this way?

My husband and I loved this dish!  It was so tasty and quick to make.  I served it with a side of garlic couscous.  Next time I'll try it with the medium salsa instead of mild to spice it up even more.

I tried this last night and it was a definite hit!  I used haddock in lieu of the cod and it was succulent.  I have a dear firend that loves fish but can't eat salsa due to the onions and the peppers, I will make this dish for her with canned tomatoes and I bet it will be super.  Also with all the specialty salsas out today you could serve this dish and have it taste different many times over.

My boyfriend said (and I quote), "This is the best dinner you've ever made for me." I am a terrible cook, so that might attribute why I had yet to make a good meal, but this was SO easy, it was impossible to mess up. Used Cod and had ZERO problems with bones.

This was a HUGE success when I made it for friends! I used halibut instead of cod, spendy but worth it to not have to sit picking out bones. Even friends who don't care for fish were clamouring for seconds!

This was an excellent fish recipe.  My kids loved it and even had a second helping.  Next time I will try it with Halibut as the cod is a bit more fishy tasting.

this was really good and very easy. i rarely make fish other than salmon b/c i am not really sure how to cook it.  i got a pretty nice piece of cod from my local grocery store and followed directions, cooking a bit longer to complete.  my son loved it and so did i.  will make again for sure.

I assembled this ahead of time in the morning and it worked out great (shockingly the Fritos didn’t end up soggy)!  I rinsed and blotted fresh cod until very dry.  I later baked it for 30 minutes, broiled for a few more, and served it as fish tacos,  inside hard shells with lettuce, tomato and plain Greek yogurt (which I sub for sour cream).  My 5-year-old also loved it!

This was awesome!  I used salsa that was hot.  Didn't even need the avocado or sour cream.  I served with black beans that I added jalapenos and cayenne pepper to.  Thank you!!

Made this tonight and it was delish! I used wild caught cod placed on a thin bed of medium salsa after adding salt and pepper. More salsa spooned atop each piece of fish. Shredded Monterey Jack cheese sprinkled across the top of the dish. Omitted the avocado and corn chips because I didn't have them.  Covered the baking dish with foil and baked at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Removed foil for 5 minutes before end time. Dish is done when cheese has melted and fish flakes easily with a fork and when sauce is bubbly. The sauce was very tasty on rice or couscous. A great and easy dish! NOTE: There is little to no "fishy" taste or smell after it is cooked. Thank you for posting!    Judi David

I'm happy to have come across this recipe, a unique way to prepare cod! I just eye-balled the amount of ingredients to top the fish with and baked for 20 min. The avocado and sour cream really complimented the dish, especially since my salsa was 'hot'. Nice crunch from the corn chips, too. Thanks for this great recipe which I'll surely make again!

Loved this recipe - I used my own homemade salsa and tilapia since I didn't have cod, but will definitely make this again.

Definitely make sure the water is out of the cod if frozen. With that said, it was really good.  I was skeptical of the crunchy topping, my husband was skeptical of the whole dish.  We both loved it!  I used my Nuwave oven at 350 and it worked fine.  Keep checking for flakiness as over cooked fish is awful.  This is a keeper.  Couldn’t be easier.               Or yummier.

Made as directed, but didn’t measure anything. Used bass that I’d caught this summer and had frozen.  Very good for something different. Thanks for sharing

I used crushed taco-flavored Doritos and baked for 20 minutes. It was a big hit. Also works with sliced pork too.

Spiced it up with Cajun and used half butter half oil.  I used salsa from Farmers market instead.  It turned out awesome and was so easy. Wife dug it too.

This is hubbies favorite fish!  This time I didn't have shredded cheddar but I did have sliced cheddar and pepper jack, just put 1/2 slice of each on the fish and cook.  Gave it a little more kick.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe, using our favorite medium salsa, a Mexican blend of shredded cheese, and jalapeno kettle chips for the topping.  The dish was super easy and delicious!

As another reviewer pointed out, it's best for people who aren't that fond of fish.  I had mistakenly bought some essentially tasteless fish, so it met tonight’s need.  It would have been a waste with something good.  I wasn't overly fond of the chips on top.  It was, however, wonderfully easy.

I looked "okay" from the pictures, but in looking for a fun way to start Lent we went with the five-star dinner. Members did not lie! This was great; the whole family loved it, and even though we were dubious (sour cream on fish?), we were pleasantly surprised. Added to the favorites list after two bites!

I used haddock because cod is to fishy tasting for my liking. Purists, like my hubby didn't care for it....he likes it plainer.  I actually prepared the dish and it was so easy, which is a priority for me.  My haddock was thicker and had to cook for about 25 minutes, but the chips on top were nice and crispy....not soggy like others stated in reviews. I also added a squirt of lime juice over the salsa. Easy and unique!

Passed the picky husband test.  As other reviewers said, would be way to wet if you don't drain some moisture.  I followed a reviewers advice of cooking fish alone 10 min, drain and add the salsa, cheese and chips and cook 15- 20 min longer.  I also added strips of red and poblano peppers to add some veggies.

This was so easy I thought I was doing something wrong.   I used store bought fresh pico de gallo instead of jared salsa and simply placed one layer of sliced cheddar cheese on top of the fish.  I omitted the corn chips to maintain my low carb diet and it came out wonderful.

I used about half the cheese, otherwise no changes. This was delicious and so quick/easy!  I served with chipotle rice ( diced chipotle in adobo and black olives stirred into rice as cooking, then add grape tomatoes and cilantro during last five minutes of cooking). Thanks for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed it.  Instead of crushed corn chips, I tore up a couple of taco shells and fried them in oil.  Reminded us of a fish burrito or enchilada in taste.

Thank you for this easy and flexible recipe!  I only had pumpkin salsa so I used Rotel instead.  I didn't have sour cream or avocado either so I left that off.  Still, it was good!  I will be trying this again as written and I am confident it will be good.  And I will also try it with chicken because that seems like it would be equally good.

Very good recipe. I used frozen fish, because other flavors cover fish in this meal. Only thing I changed was to season sour cream with taco seasoning mix, because I like to use a lot of it over rice. This recipe is also very forgiving, you don't have to measure all ingredients, just toss them in so that it looks good.

Cod was on sale so I came here to find an easy recipe. Told the boyfriend I was making "Mexican Cod" for dinner and he gave me this look like...ummm okay....DANG! It was yummy! The only thing I did different was I added a packet of Old El Paso Mexican Cooking Sauce in the Roasted Tomato flavor. I just poured it on the bottom of my baking dish the put the fish and other ingredients on top. EASY and yummy! Will make again the next time the fish goes on sale!!

What I really like about this recipe is that my children had no idea they were eating fish, I used tilapia and swai fillets instead of cod, and the only chips I had on hand were Nacho cheese doritos, but awesome recipe, and will definitely add in my recipe box

This was a very easy meal to recreate, and it tasted great...I used Tilapia instead of Cod, and mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheese.

This is delicious! I Made it for my Dad when he came back from Florida, He loves fish. I added my own touch and sprinkled fresh squeezed  lime juice on top after cooking! I think it totally topped it off

BTW, the measurements for the ingredients don't seem necessary, but thats just me.

Probably one of the easiest & tastiest baked fish recipes ever!  Made this for a Mexican dinner party with friends & everybody loved it! An absolute winner! I made a guacamole & served this alongside the fish with a bowl of sour cream & extra corn chips and acompanied the dish with a black bean salad & coriander rice. YUMMO!

I used tilapia since I already had some in the freezer.  I used mild salsa and the packaged shredded Mexican blend cheese since that is what I had on hand. No need to measure ingredients.  I didn't use the avocado slices and sour cream since I am not a fan of either.  I love this fish dish.  My husband wasn't keen on the fritos so when I make it again, I will leave the corn chips off of his fillet.

This was so quick, so tasty, and healthy, too! I made half the recipe in my toaster over with flounder filets. Sprayed the pan, spread the fish with pico de gallo, then a mixture of extra sharp cheddar and pepper jack. I crumbled a handful of tortilla chips by hand. By the time I had the avocado sliced, the fish was just about done. I turned the oven to broil for a minute or two, and served with fat-free refried beans heated in the microwave with a little shredded cheese on top.  I didn't bother with the sour cream. I cook a lot of fish and I never would have thought of this combination!

Quick and easy recipe, and everyone in the family ate it!  I didn't have salsa, so I substituted enchilada sauce.  Did not measure ingredients - just poured on the sauce, sprinkled with cheese, and tossed some crushed corn chips on top.  Yum!

wow, this was really good; i would have never guessed cod would be good this way. I made two filets the way you suggested, but i made one with mild taco sauce instead, because I have reflux. it turned out quite yummy too!

My husband caught 7 nice size catfish and i didn't want to fry so I tried this recipe, Excellent! I used the Mexican cheese blend. Also used two different types of salsas. One side medium the other side hot for different taste buds. Everyone enjoyed. The final comment was they do prefer their catfish fried! Next time and there will be a next time I will choose a different fish.

Very easy and quick! Used tilapia and baked fish at 400 for 10 minutes, seasoned with lime juice, cumin, garlic, and chili powder. Then poured off excess liquid from fish, added 1 can black beans, drained; salsa; cheese and chips and baked for about 12 -15 min. more. We all loved and felt that this was a fairly healthy dish. Served w light sour cream :)

This is a nice change from the usual grilled, baked, broiled or pan fried fish. The recipe calls for cod but all I had on hand was tilapia and it worked out great. I imagine any mild fish would work just fine for this recipe. Great as is or tweak to your taste.

I have made this with tilapia and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Both were excellent & very easy. Both would be great tucked into a tortilla for a fish (or chicken) taco.

I will alway keep this recipe.  I made my own Salsa of course it was hot and I sprinkled the fish with lemon pepper before adding the salsa - cheese and crushed fritos...  It was a burst of flavor is your month...  Doesn't even taste like fish...  Don't miss out on this recipe as it is delicious...

Made this with fish and chicken since I know my kids hate fish.  My boyfriend & I enjoyed the fish.  I did have to add some extra seasoning.  The kids didn't like the chicken but hey, kids are picky so no harm, no foul there.

This recipe seems too good to be true! Its so simple and easy to make!!  This dish makes me feel like an accomplished chef...no one needs to know its that easy to make!.Ive made it 3 times and am recommending it to everyone cooks. My sister who normally hates cod-fish gobbled this all up.

A quick and easy dinner for after work.  Served with a a tossed salad and it makes a light and delightful dinner.  Hubby who doesn't care for fish LOVED it.  I made my with Basa, but have made it with cod and even halibut.

This was so easy and so good!  I served it with tortillas and my husband rolled it up in them and ate it like a fish taco.  Next time I will serve it with shredded lettuce as well.

I can't say enough about this recipe! My whole family loved this-those who like fish and those who don't. I used tilapia as a personal preference and no avocado. The sour cream was available, but the fish was so wonderful without it, that nobody used it! I also doubled the recipe and used 2 lbs. of fish. That was perfect for five of us to enjoy, but that would have been enough for six. Yummy!!!   Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.....

I will make this again, but next time I will sprinkle some Mexican seasoning directly on the fish before I put the salsa on top.  My kids really enjoyed this one!

Not bad. I used Tilapia. I think the salsa made the fish a bit watery, so I cooked longer and then broiled for a few minutes.

My husband thought this was a good fish recipe though not "out of this world" good.  I am not a big fish fan and found it a little too "fishy" tasting for me.  I would consider using this recipe for chicken as others have done.

So good! I'd advise like others did to season the fish before baking. I used sea bass and cooked it in the toaster over. I was worried about over or undercooking the fish so I baked it for 10 minutes before topping it. I added fire roasted tomates and nopales (cactus) to the mix, cut back a little on the salsa, and left out the cheese.

I made this recipe with cod out of the freezer and it was really good.  The corn chips give it a nice crunch.  This is a delicous and easy way to cook fish.

This definitely a five star for taste & ease to make.  Used fresh cod as called for & glad I did since, as it seems to be a thicker fish.  Topped with our favorite salsa (Garden Fresh--found in refrig. section at store) & half sharp cheese/half jack cheese.  Served with side of black beans and rice.  Very, very good and very, very easy!

We are a family that loves to eat fish.  This is one recipe that after one bite, we collectively pushed our plates away and ate our salads instead!  We are not picky eaters. Definitely would not recommend.

This was actually very good...  I only made 2 tilapia fillets -so didn't really measure anything.  It was very easy and yummy!  It took exactly 15 minutes to cook - and I also topped it with a little cilantro..  :)

Loved it. It was so easy to make. I had fresh fish, which was frozen, so it came out a little watery, but it didn't cause any major problems. I coupled this dish with Spanish Rice II as some others have suggested and it was absolutely perfect.

Yummy!  This was easy to throw together (no measuring here) and tasty.  It wasn't the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, but as one other reviewer noted, the work to taste ratio is excellent!  :-)  I'm going to make this with chicken, next week.  I think it'll be even better that way!

Typically I'm a lemon/lime with fish kind of girl but I decided to try something new and I am so glad I did! This was a gorgeous spicy fish dish. We had it with spicy rice and beans. I used spicy salsa and old cheese. I think that's what gave it the punch that made it taste so lovely!

Super easy dish - one suggestion. I used fresh salsa, and it definitely gave it a more crisp flavor. Some green chilies would be a great addition if you like spicy stuff!

I do not like fish but wanted to cook some fish for my husband.  He really enjoyed the fish!  I used hot salsa for the kick.  I was ecstatic with the ease of the recipe and my husband's reaction to it.  I will certainly make this again.

Hmmm I give it 5 stars, Should be even better if I followed the recipe exactly... but I didnt have corn chips, so I used bread crumbs, and I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar... Want to try again with no change...

My wife made this dish for me. She didn't have avocado or sour cream so we did without. She didn't have corn chips so she substituted Chinese noodles.  She made it with Spanish rice and black beans. She's a great cook and I always enjoy her cooking - but this dish was a cut above. It was TERRIFIC.

What a great way to mix it up! I love this recipe- I used just a smear of a spicy salsa and a little jarred chipotle, lots of shredded cheddar and crushed toasted white corn tortillas I had left over. The fish was really spicy- but delicious. I served it with avocado and a mixture of rice, beans, and corn. Will make again.

This is really good! Nice, easy and economical. I used pollock for a milder fish and it came out moist and tasty. I'm not a big fish eater but was looking for some good baking recipes and this is a definite one. This will be at the top of my fish menu from now on!

Implemented a semi-homemade method - used Costco 6-layer dip and corn chips on Marlin.  Turns out to be a very good recipe for using party leftovers!

Excellent recipe. I had frozen cod and although it thawed in the fridge all day it was still really cold in the center. I had to extend the cooking time by 10 or 15 minutes, but it still came out absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent meal, I used a semi stale bag of sour cream flavored Doritos my kids would not finish off, I crumpled them up and it was excellent. I also use Talipia Fish instead.

I've made this recipe a few times using either cod or mahi mahi.  This time I rubbed it a bit with olive oil, salt & pepper and a small squeeze of lime.  Let it marinade while the oven heated up.  Then I spooned salsa over it.  At 15 minutes, I added the cheese and cooked it another 5 minutes. Perfect!  No chips needed.  Served it over yellow rice and a side of veggies.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe! For the salsa I used the red canned salsa either from herdez or la costena. They were asking for seconds! I used fresh tilapia as opposed to frozen.

I did not care too much for this recipe.  I don't think the fish had enough flavor.  I did use talapia instead of cod because my husband doesn't like cod.  I don't think I will make it again.  It was easy to do though.

This was pretty good for such a simple recipe.  I used Cod, but becuase of the boldness of the other ingredients, a stronger tasting fish would work just fine.

Great recipe!  A super easy way to sneak fish into picky eaters like my kids.  I called it "fish nachos" and even my pickiest eaters gobbled it up.  I made it with some really mild salsa, but it could be as hot and flavorful as you choose.  Thanks!!

This was fantastic! I was really not expecting too much because it was such a simple recipe but I was pleasantly suprised or shocked is maybe a better word...the work to taste ratio is through the roof. I used tilapia and I only made 3 pieces, another plus is that it adjusts easily, I live alone and I'm always looking for something to make for 1. Great all around.

This was so easy and very tasty! I did not have sour cream or avacado at the time so I skipped this part. The dish was wonderful over rice. I told several of my friends about this one. Thanks for sharing a great tasty, easy to fix meal idea!

I had a dinner party over the weekend and prepared this for 7 people. It was a huge success. Used tilapia because it was less expensive. A medium level spicy store bought salsa complements it well. Left out the chip topping because I didn't find the idea appealing. I dont know how much cheese I ended up topping the fillets with but I tried not to use too much so as not to overwhelm the dish. Rather than dressing each plate with the sour cream and guacamole, guests passed around a bowl of sour cream, a bowl of avocado slices, and also a bowl of lemon wedges and fixed their fish how they wished. A couple squirts of fresh lemon juice really went nicely.

Really easy and good. I had to use salmon due to my husbands fish allergy (he can only eat some fish). It still tasted great. I served it with wild rice and veggies.

I didn't think this dish would be sooo good since it was sooo easy, but it was awesome. I made it for company and my skinny-minnie friend ate FOUR servings! It was so easy I didn't measure anything. I used 3-12oz. packages of frozen flounder, patted it really dry as other reviews recommended, and placed it all in a 9x15 jellyroll pan with just a little overlapping. I used 1-16 oz. jar of salsa, 1-10 oz. block of cheese, shredded, and about half a bag of chips. Baked for 20 minutes, the same time it takes to cook Spanish Rice. Everything was done at the same time and was great with avocado and sour cream. This is going into our favorites file for sure!

Light, flavorful, and easy. Used tilapia and no cheese. Garnished with avacado, sour cream, and cilantro over white rice. Yum.

Great recipe. Fast and easy to prepare. I gave the option of eating as is or putting it in a tortilla for a fish taco. The only thing it was missing was a little lime. Husband asked for this one again. Nice change from the usual cod recipes I use. I will keep this one for sure.

Was a great base to start with.  Just felt it was a little bland so I spiced up the fish with a little garlic and cumin - two of my favorites for Mexican dishes!  So simple, wish you could rate it 4.5 stars :)

I made this dish exactly as described but it wasn't a hit with my family. While the adults ate it dutifully (it wasn't terrible), the kids refused to touch it. Perhaps if I'd used a fish besides cod it could have been better.

Ahhhhhh! So good and so easy! I used frozen tilapia. I really just couldn't believe how tasty the flavors were and am so surprised that some found it bland. The guac, chz, and salsa really added a lot of flavor to a fish that is def perhaps a bit bland, maybe they didn't top it with enough. I can't wait to make this again!!!

Very bland. The fish needed to be seasoned on its own in addition to the salsa and cheese in order to give it more flavor. Also, it was too watery after it was cooked.

For what this is, it was OK. Definitely not something I will make again. Cod is just not that great when if not marinated or breaded. The taste was incredibly bland. It would be great as fish tacos with some cabbage and corn tortillas.

I made this with basa fillets instead of cod, and it turned out really delicious. My husband isn't always excited to hear I'm cooking fish, but this almost seemed like we weren't eating fish. We both loved it.

Extremely simple to make, and a good mixture of flavors. As usual I went crazy with the cheese but otherwise good with the few simple ingredients as written. I like a very white fish so may make it with Alaskan Polluck.Thanks for posting.

Wow, this is great! I used hot salsa because we like the heat, Over the salsa before adding the cheese, I added the juice of a whole fresh lime, then sprinkled on garlic salt, chili powder, and cumin. I used more cheese than the recipe specified. The flavors are awesome! Super simple and fast too!

Very yummy! I had tilapia on hand so I used it instead of cod. It was frozen, so as other reviewers suggested, I thawed it and patted it dry thoroughly with paper towels. Then I put it on a cookie sheet lined with foil sprayed with non-stick spray. I used some habanero cheese and cheddar on top of the chunky salsa and sprinkled a bit of garlic powder. Baked for 10 minutes and broiled for about 3 minutes to crisp up the top. Came out great! Foolproof, and no need to measure. Also, I served it with the Fiesta Cheese Rice from this site. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was yummy! My boyfriend loves Mexican food and adding fish to our selection is great! We have made this with Haddock and Halibut and prefer the Halibut, but both were tasty. We paired it with Spanish rice made with quinoa instead of rice.

This is a keeper.  I didn't change a thing.  I get tired of reading reviews that rate a recipe high then tell you how they completely changed the recipe. I put extra corn chips on because I like the crunch but that's all and that doesn't change the recipe all around. I will make this again for sure.

So easy and really tasty!  I also broiled it for a couple minutes after baking it, which made it nice a crispy. Served with black beans and rice. You don't really need the avocado.

So good, SO easy!  I was skeptical when I assembled the ingredients, but when it started cooking and filling the house with a delectable aroma, I had high hopes.  We were not disappointed.  I followed the recipe to a T, although I did use (thawed) frozen cod fillets, and made sure they were patted quite dry before cooking, so they wouldn't be mushy.  Also, I just eyeballed the amount of cheese and salsa.  Husband and I cleaned the entire pan, rolling them up in flour tortillas we heated on a gas burner.  This one's a keeper!

This was a hit! I'm not a big fish fan but this tasted great! I served it with mexican rice, guacamole, salsa and blue corn chips, and it is definitely something we'll be having again in our house.

This recipe is amazing for being so simple!  I am not a big fish eater, but even I scarfed this right down!  And, my 3-yr-old cleared his plate, too!

The testure of the fish was perfect - not dry, and I thought mild salsa was great for flavor without overpowering the fish.  I did use Red Snapper instead of cod, and I used about 2 cups of salsa instead of one (we love sauce at my house!).  I also cooked just a bit longer because my filets were a little bit larger.

Excellent - especially when in a hurry!

The cod was too fishy for us...next time I'll use tilapia. Other than that, not too bad.

This was good, but I used orange roughy fish and think it may be better on another type of fish, or better yet, on chicken. I made sure to pat the fish dry and used fat free sour cream.

This was easy and tasty. I used Nile perch, which is a thick fillet so, in order to prevent the cheese burning before the fish baked, I slathered on salsa and baked for nearly half an hour. Then I added the cheese and chips and baked for about ten more minutes. I didn't have corn chips so I used potato chips - definitely not as good, but it added great crunch. I used Nile per

Delicious!!!!  My VERY picky about fish and so since it had many great reviews I tried it.  Did not change the recipe except I added a few dashes of hot sauce at the end since we love spicy food.  This is a keeper and will make a few times a month.

i made this because many people said its good for picky eaters who hate fish. they were right - i couldn't believe it. im still stunned a day later. no leftovers!! will definitely make this again!! i used tilapia and didnt measure salsa/cheese, just made sure the fish was covered with them before baking. made it a few hours ahead then just popped in the oven when it was time for dinner.

Tasty and easy to make.  However, I found the flavor of the salsa to be a bit overbearing and will use less next time.  I also substituted bread crumbs for the corn chips.  Otherwise, a nice recipe.

This is surprisingly good. I bought fresh cod and frozen (coleman's catch)  to see if I could tell the difference. This recipe doesn't work with the frozen brand. Too fishy and flavors don't mix well. The fresh fish is mild and all flavor blend. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400. That was enough to cook the fish and crisp the chips.

Oh my goodness this just could not be more simple or delicious. I loved it. Didn't do the sour cream and didn't have avocado but a spoonful of Trader Joe's guacamole finished it off wonderfully. Thank you for this recipe - it's a keeper!

I wasn't too sure about this, but decided to try it anyway and I'm so glad I did.  I followed the recipe and used crushed up blue corn chips because that's what I had on hand.  Even my five year old ate this and he doesn't eat much.  This is a keeper.

Pretty good.  Used Salsa verde & mahi mahi.  I don't think I will put the chips on next time though.  I didn't think it needed it.  Also, didn't use the sour cream or avocado (didn't have any & I don't think that it really needed it).

I love mexican food. I thought this was a really good recipe and will make it again in the future.  The cod itself is pretty bland, which is nice because it takes on the flavors of whatever you add to it. However,I wonder if the cod could be marinated in some of the salsa prior to give the actual fish more flavor.  We used a mild Chipotle salsa which was great, we added fresh Cilantro, sour cream and because our avocados were really unripe, we made guacamole.

Very nice! Doesn't get more simple than that...nice flavor and the fish was nice and flaky. I didn't have any sharp cheddar so I grated some American cheese that we had a block of,not as good but an ok backup...I really liked the crushed tortilla chips on top. 
Thank you for sharing!

This was a fairly good and easy meal. We turned it into a fish taco salad - put baked fish on top of a bed of romaine lettuce with avacado, sour cream, corn, beans, onions, and extra salsa. Fish needed an extra 5 minutes in the oven as well.

My husband normally is not a big fish person, but he loved this dish.  I thought it was good, not fantastic.  That's probably because the fish itself was tough.  I   had to defrost it in the microwave, which may have caused the problem.  Next time, I'll try with fresh fish.  And there definitely will be a next time, because this dish is incredibly easy.  Go ahead and try it.  It's so easy to make, you won't feel annoyed if you don't like you would if you'd spent hours on it.

Unfortunately, the combination of Mexican toppings and fish didn't work for my family. It just felt like maybe they would work better on chicken.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it's good - much better than I expected than when I put it in the oven. It's another easy one - put some cod fillets in a greased baking dish, cover with salsa, shredded cheese, crushed corn chips and bake. Top with avocado (I skipped the sour cream).

This tasted like fish nachos.  We enjoyed them with black beans and a glass of cold beer.

This was delicious!  I didn't have the avocado but followed the recipe to a tee.  I did have to cook it for about 10 minutes longer.  I used Frontera medium salsa and Frontera blue corn chips.  I will make this many times.  The blend of the fish with the Mexican flavor is perfect!

This was very easy and good, but took about 10 minutes longer than expected to cook.  My fillets were pretty thick, but next time I think i'll try it with tilapia.

Very, very good - and easy!  I've also used red or green enchilada sauce instead of the salsa and that is delicious also - and you can pass on the avocador and/or sour cream and it still is great.  You've got to try this!
Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

I used frozen tilapia and cooked it a little bit longer. My husband loved it, and my five year old ate it without complaint. I thought it was good, but not spectacular. I'll make it again, maybe with some olives and fresh jalapenos next time.

Good fish.  The salsa does overpower the fish a bit but it’s still a nice and different way to eat fish.  I just added about half of the cheese and just a little bit of crushed tortilla chips for different texture. I didn’t use avocado or sour cream.

YUM!!!!  Rock my socks good!  I followed the recipe exactly- except that I cooked it for 28 mins and didn't have an avacado.  I served this over black beans and rice and with a green salad. I think it would be good with some black olives, lettuce, tomatoes and onions on the top too!  That's what I'll try next time!  YUM!!!!!!  Thank you!

My husband loved this recipe, while I thought that it was absoultely terrible.  He thought that it was excellent and tasty.  I thought that it was a waste of cod (which is expensive.)  I just didnt think that the flavor of the salsa complimented the fish, at all.  Seeing as my husband and I had such differing opinions, I guess you would just have to try it and be the judge.

This was pretty good. I used Talipia, and it tasted real fishy to me, but that could be because I am pregnant. Will make this again and try chicken. All in all..very good.

What is all the hype?  I don't get it!  This was super easy and everyone ate it but it was nothing special.  We all agreed that we won't make it again at our house...there are just a million other dishes we'd rather eat.

Excellent. My husband wanted fish for dinner.  I don't like fish and picked this recipe because of the reviews.  I can't describe how good this is.  It really doesn't taste like "fish".  The flavors blend together perfectly.  I made it the night before and cooked it the next evening.

My family and I did not like this at all. We are huge fish eaters, and we all felt it didn't even taste like fish, which is maybe the idea. I didn't use cod, I used walleye and pan fish. My children wouldn't eat more than 1 bite and they all love mexican food. I guess if you're trying to mask the taste of fish, this would be a good recipe.

So easy to make!  Next time I think I will add a little uncooked rice under the cod and salsa to soak up some of the juices and add a little more to the dish.

I have made this many times, we love it.  I make one side with the chips over the cheese, as the recipe suggests, & the other side with the cheese over the chips, the way my husband likes it.  I do bake it 15 to 20 minutes longer than suggested. I also add chopped jalapenos to the salsa for an extra kick.

This was delicious and so easy to make.  I used Halibut instead of cod and cooked it 5 more minutes since it wasn't cooked through at 15 min.  I also used Mango Salsa which had a great flavor. The avacado and sour cream were great to top it off!

I admit to being a bit of a skeptic and held on to this a bit before making.... BOY WAS I WRONG!
I used tilapa instead of cod, and placed a dollup of guacamole instead of the avocado slice. I used frito's, but would recommend tortilla chips instead---that's what I will be using next time I make this. (Which my husband requested soon!)

I had to cook the fish for another 12 more minutes, the cooking time was definitely not long enough.  Good recipe though.

Very good, I was skeptical, but due to the positive reviews (and because it was soooo simple) I tried it - everyone loved it, inlcuding the 2-year old!  The corn chips really are good on top, they add a saltiness and crunch that is surprisingly nice.  Will make again definately!

I didn't have sour cream or avocado.  Tasted like cheese, salsa and corn chips. Meaning... If you like that, I think you'll like this. I used cod so it didn't have a strong flavor at all. Served with refried beans with sprinkling of green onion. Good stuff.

I had very poor results with this recipe.  It turned out quite bland and the fish was tough.  Maybe the problem was with the salsa I used (Newman's Own)?

I thought this was very good.I don't like fish that tastes like fish, so this works great for my family. Actually made this several times during lent and twice for company. They loved it also. My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe and made it for the rest of the family. Great recipe to add fish to ones diet and reduce the red meat.

Thanks Christine

I love fish and Mexican and I thought this recipe was pretty good. I used cod. Originally I tried it w/out any sour cream or avocado and it was very bland but with them it was good. It was quite a bit watery. Very easy to make.

I finished it off with a minute under the broiler to make the top nice and toasted.

This recipe was pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. The fish itself could have maybe been marinated or seasoned with something. i would try it and again and experiment more. I also made it with my homemade salsa and seved it with "Black Beans and Rice" from this website.

Do not make this unless you LOVE fish! My husband LIKES fish but HATED this dish. I admit I had to agree with his dislike so we ended up not even eating it. I made it per the directions and everything seemed fine but the taste was like fishy salsa with cheese. Just not a combination we want to experience again.

This was FABULOUS!  For the effort put forth this is truly a 5 star meal.  I used Chile & Lime Fritos combined with French's French Fried Onion's.  I also used White Roughy and it was so moist and flavorful, I highly recommend this easy recipe.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  I followed the suggestion and served it with black beans and rice.  I felt that a five-star rating was warranted because the quality was very good considering the ease and quickness of preparation.

I did not like it!!  My husband didn't like it either.  I don't know if I did something wrong but some of the crushed chips became soggy while others were really hard.  The salsa and cheese just slid off when you tried to take a bite of the fish.  I know a lot of people like this receipe but it was difficult to eat and was not pleasing to me at all.

This dish is very simple to put together, it's fast, and it's delicious.  I used  tilapia and I also salted the avacado as suggested by other reviewers.  My son suggested adding onions the next time---I agree, and plan to try it again soon with a bit of chopped onion. I needed to cook this 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.
