We both really liked this recipe, although I did change up some things.  Based on other reviewers, I also only added 3TB of butter.  Didn't miss it at all.  I used a large can of cream of mushroom soup, I browned my onions ahead of time, added more mushrooms than called for (I had and extra package) and added a bit of herb de provence seasoning to the meat.  I used pork shoulder instead of beef as well since I am not a fan of red meat.  Meat melted in your mouth after 8 hours in the slow cooker.  It was a bit runny with just these ingredients, so I also added 1/2 container of sour cream mixed with 2TB of flour, and let it simmer for about 30 mins then let it set and thicken up for another 30 mins.  Delicious!  And, like all slow cooker meals, it was even better the next day.  Definitely will make again!

Hubby and I really liked this recipe, and it was really quick and easy to make.  Next time, though, I'll be using less butter - I don't think it needed that muc butter.  And I may add a cup of sour cream during the last hour or so in the crock pot.

I used this recipe as a guideline along with another slowcooker recipe. I added parsley, dill and mustard in at the beginning. I used no butter.  I added in wheat egg noodles into the slow cooker for the last 40 minutes to make this a one-pot meal.  Then I mixed in 8 oz of light sour cream after it was done.  Delicious!!

really easy to make followed recipe, but took suggestions about additional seasoning, definitely needed it.  would also follow suggestion of using less butter didn't need all of that.  also it came out a bit soupy.  luckily I made biscuits on the side to sop it up.  would do again but make tweaks to the recipe.  thanks for sharing.

As other reviewers said, a bit too much butter! I found myself taking a spoon to the butter and discarding it. I also added some pepper. I think it could have even used more seasoning than that. 
VERY GOOD though. Very filling. My whole family ate it!

This was great over egg noodles.  Used 4T of butter (instead of 1/2 cup) and added frozen peas and a little sour cream. I used beef stew chunks that didn't soften enough although I cooked for 8 hrs.  However, I'll keep it in the slow cooker file to make again.

I made it just yesterday, and although I added the serving amount it was amazing. So easy! It got my picky eaters eating something they never liked to eat. Mushrooms! I think the next time I won't use so much butter. But all in all, this was great!

I am so disappointed. I followed the recipe word for word. The stroganoff mixture was thin and soupy. It had the consistency of water more so than a gravy mixture. It sunk right to the bottom of the bowl when we poured it over the noodles. It was also very bland. We won't be making this dish again.

So easy and awesome! I add 8oz of sour cream to the crock pot about 30 minutes before serving. Makes it super creamy and delicious! Great recipe.

This is brilliant and so easy! I made it for my husband's surprise birthday party and everyone loved it. They forgot about dessert because they were so busy eating this! Now to find a way to make it with less fat and less sodium.

Was good, but very watery.  Tried to add corn starch, but it didn't do much. Also, needed more seasoning. Very bland.

Totally delicious and awesome!! I didn't change a thing about the recipe. Two packages of stew beef, one whole stick of butter, one whole package of pre-sliced, pre-washed mushrooms, coarsely chopped onion, and two cans of soup. Perfect and couldn't be any easier. It has a flavor and the meat has a tenderness that can't be achieved by anything but a slow cooker! The flavors are something amazing after 8 hours on low. Might try to marinate the beef tips next time. Just didn't think of it. Delicious!!

It was delicious and filling, and I will be making this again soon. Awesome work. A little bit to much butter, but all I did was a garlic and extra onion, and it was great.

I followed the advice of others and added only 3 tablespoons of butter. I used a can of cream of mushroom with garlic and a golden cream of mushroom. I also added about 14 oz. of sour cream mixed with 2 tablespoons of flour an hour before serving. My family loved it!

This recipe was super easy to put together. I did tweak this recipe a bit.  My husband and I have always put sour cream in our stroganoff,  so we added that and I kicked it up a notch and added cream cheese too!!  Delicious!

This was really easy to make and delicious. Like some of the other reviewers, I used less butter (3 tablespoons). It was a little bit runny while hot  but it was perfect after sitting all night in the fridge.  The leftovers were awesome!

My mom used to make this in the oven and I  make it in a slow cooker.  Mom's addition to this receipe was to place the meat on top of sliced onions and then add an envelope of dry onion soup on top of the meat.  Continue with cream soup and mushrooms (fresh or canned),  Because of the salt and seasonings in the dry onion soup nothing else needs to be added.  Mom always knew best!

Good but very watery. Had to transfer to another pot to thicken it.   Added oregano to add to taste. Glad I did.
