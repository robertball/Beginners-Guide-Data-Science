These was so easy to make and turned out wonderful.  I did use heavy cream instead of water because I was trying to use the last of the cream I had up.  It was hard to keep them all about the same size.  This is going in my keeper file.

Such an easy recipe! I did half milk chocolate and half dark and they both turned out great. Next time I will probably put the caramel/pecan mixture in a pan to cool in the freezer and then cut it into small cubes. I just prefer smaller pieces and I think it'd be easier to work with that way.

Don't put these on wax paper.  Who knew there was a difference in the paper you put it on?  Not me.  :(  Otherwise these were delicious.  I thought I read everything so closely and now I see it was right in the "partner tip".  Help me Rhonda.

This recipe was awesome. I switched out milk chocolate for the dark chocolate and it was completely delicious. Dark chocolate tends to melt better so I will definitely try this recipe with dark chocolate too. I Will make this again for Thanksgiving and after. This is now my go to recipe

Family loved them.  The first time I made them I used a big spoonful to drop them.  Much better to make small spoonful of mixture.  Freezing makes dipping into chocolate easier.

Fast basic recipe.  I added a bit more butter and used cream instead of water.  I wanted a softer caramel than is typical so it worked out well!  I sprinkled a tiny amount of salt on top of half of them before freezing the first time, then coated with the dark chocolate.   This added a whole new dimension to the candies.  The salted caramel ones were favorites by far!  There was no way to tell which you were getting so the kids enjoyed the treasure hunt!  I'd definitely make these again.  I'm giving 4 stars because I changed the recipe and didn't use it exactly as written.

Once melted the caramel is very soft and you have to work with it quickly. I had to place half back to freezing to finish.
The chocolate also melts in your fingers as soon as you pick them up.
I believe it needs simething added to the chocolate like coconut butter.
I may try again with adding it.

I followed the instructions however my candy thermometer broke and I had to estimate the cooking time for the caramel 
It was good though but a lot of work
