I substituted sour cream for the Greek yogurt as stated in the footnotes and was only going to give it 4 stars but this combination of flavors had me going back for more. This was great on tortilla chips and would be equally great as a dip for fries or as a spread on burgers.

Spicy but good. Was looking for a dip for my sweet potato wedges and a was exactly what I was looking for.........the only change I made was to use agave in place of the sugar. Will definitely make again
