Just made into muffins . Used non-fat vanilla yogurt  instead of  sour cream . Brown sugar replaced raw. Added cinnamon , peanut butter , shredded coconut , hemp seeds , sesame seeds , sunflower seeds . Ground seeds and nuts just slightly . Didn't have teff nor poppy seeds . Baked for about 17 minutes . Made a dozen regular size muffins and one mini loaf . Very moist , not too sweet . Will definitely make again .
