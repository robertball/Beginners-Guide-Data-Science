Pretty good. If I make this again I would add some seasonings to the pork. A flavor packet or two from Ramen noodles would really perk it up. I would also eliminate the raisins as having them in the mix was more of an oddity than a flavor enhancer.

I used sausages with the casings removed instead of ground pork and it turned out great. Definitely making it again.

This was delicious with a couple of additions. Additional seasoning to the browning meat - I added some basil celery salt and additional pepper. Once the meat was browned and I added the onion and garlic back in I added about a cup of canned/diced tomatoes (with liquid) with a cup of chicken broth. I also added way more raisins than it called for. It was amazing way more flavourful than I expected for a quick dish. I'm definitely making again.

Kinda dry bland and crumbly. Looks beautiful though. It needs sauce. I added in vegetable stock and cornstarch to thicken soy sauce and a splash of sriracha. Not sure it's the best match for the dish but it's what I had on hand. Also added way more raisins than called for.

I also thought this recipe was dry but I enjoyed the flavor. The first I added some vegetables to it but it didnt help with the dryness. Then I fixed it again according to the recipe and instead of adding vegetables I added chunked pineapple withe juice and cashews. Wow we love it!

We did some touch-ups to the recipe, as my wife is Filipino.  The pictures look like it has mixed vegetables and some kind of tomato sauce/paste, so we added that.  Also threw in some small pieces of potato.  The taste was very good, but 4 stars for the recipe not matching the pictures entirely.

P.S.  The raisins are very common for adding to Filipino foods.  I've had chicken salad with them in there if that tells you anything.  I personally don't care for them in this recipe.
