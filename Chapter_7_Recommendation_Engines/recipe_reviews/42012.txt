This dish was just ok.  Instead of adding the different peppers, I used green peppers since that is what I had on hand.  The sauce was a bit thin but extra cornstarch fixed that problem.  Also instead of the seperate honey and dijon, I used a honey dijon with extra plain dijon.  It was still on the sweet side.  This recipe is not something that I will ever crave, but both my husband and I thought is was a nice change of pace.

Good tasting recipe, but sauce is a little thin and bland. Try reducing amount of broth, and adding more mustard and honey. Quick to prepare. Really easy to make.

Superb! I used chicken thighs and boneless chicken breast cut in strips (what was on hand). Blended in a tablespoon of Honey Mustard, made the sauce separately, and browned the chicken a bit before adding the sauce. Otherwise, didn't change a thing. Served with Basmati rice and  squash. My family loved it!

This was okay - a little dry and tasteless.  I think the original recipe could be doctored into a tasty dish with a few spices and vegetables.

My boyfriend doesn't like onions so that's what I took out of the recipe - but other than that it was a great recipe.

Wonderful taste of peppers.  Next time I'll make the sauce a little thicker, but it all tasted great!
