i like the mix of snacks in it, the bugles are a great idea! What i didn't like was that its pretty bland. i would make it again but add way more seasoning and probably some garlic salt.

I like the mix also but like axelpaxels I thought it was pretty bland and would double the seasonings the especially of Cayanne,worcestershire and cajun.  Also added some garlic salt.

I've been making this for a couple of years now and have received compliments EVERY time.  When I first made it I was a little worried because it hadn't even been reviewed, but I wanted something different.  I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Now I have guys at the office getting into arguments over who gets to finish it off!  Perfect recipe as is.

I make this every year...it is a family favorite. I also use a heavy hand on the spices for more flavor. I substitute 1 cup of the pretzels and the cup of shredded wheat for 2 extra cups of chex cereal.  I use wheat and corn chex. I also follow the chex mix instructions on box to microwave and can get it done in 15min!

We liked this and it was totally easy to make, I like recipes like this. As not in my favor when getting the simple ingredients for this recipe at this time of year....shelves were empty. SO subbing Cheddar Bugles for the regular and the Duo Cheez-It's for the plain...are the adjustments I had to make...not by choice. But it still worked. I could say this could use some salt or garlic powder added at the end would be really good, not much but just a little. And knowing how well this recipe worked and the family liked it, I think personally using cheddar bugles, I would reserve the cheddar bugles(or put aside) follow through the rest of the recipes as written and add the cheddar bugles after words to get that cheesy flavor. But again, good recipe, good flavor.

Made this last year for Christmas. We didn't care for the cayenne, so I substituted garlic salt for it. I also used Old Bay for the Cajun seasoning part. That made it a huge hit in our house.

I doubled  the spices and added an extra cup of cheese crackers. This has a kick to it but is always a big hit. Definitely need to make more of this than a sweet mix (Autumn snack mix).

Great twist on the usual snack mix. My husband wasn't sure when I read him the ingredients but I made this for a neighborhood party and it was gone in no time. I was generous in my measurement of the spices because I usually add more cereal, pretzels, etc. than recommended. I'll be making this again!

This was SO good!  I made a double batch for Christmas, planning to have some left for New Year's Eve.  It disappeared on Christmas Day!  I used Wheat Chex instead of shredded wheat squares.

My husband loves homemade chex mix. This recipe helped with the basics but it needs a lot more seasoning. I added honey nut Cheerios, cheddar pretzels, cheddar cheese its, etc but something was. He did devour it though.

I made this recipe. Very nice mild flavor. Pecans are good. Made it a second time and doubled thr cajun and cayenne pepper. My family liked it even more. Gives a mild burn. A new Christmas tradition.

My new favorite snack mix.  Few changes: 2 c. Corn Chex (no shredded wheat squares) PLUS ADD one cup of one of the ingredients because using 1/2 cup butter made it kind of greasy, so I increased the mix some.  Also I baked 1hr 15 min stirring every 15 min. and I had very little “grease” in bottom of pan.  The combination of the ingredients is very good.
