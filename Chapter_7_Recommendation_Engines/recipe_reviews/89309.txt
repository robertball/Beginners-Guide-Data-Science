This was actually good, but I made fairly significant changes so I don't think I can give four stars. For one thing, green chile and feta cheese are really not terribly good together. I substituted a combination of bleu cheese, sharp cheddar and parmegiano-reggiano, with some sundried tomatoes and essentially followed the recipe as is. Like I said, it was pretty good and with a few more tweaks could be excellent. Trust me though, feta cheese and green chile are a very strange-tasting combination and the resulting aftertaste may put you off, which would be a shame because this is a very good basic recipe.

I made this for dinner and it turned out great.Based on the other reviewers I omitted the feta,used chedder and Jack cheese only, added garlic to the onion and a little cayenne. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Turned out great!  I used fresh hatch chiles... yumm!  I made a few subs, as suggested by others.  I used crumbled tofu instead of feta (similar texture), Asiago instead of Monterrey, Colby instead of Cheddar, and 4 eggs rather than 3.  I also added some spices - crushed red pepper, paprika, chili powder, cumin, etc.  I had small pie crusts so this mix was enough for two.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, this was SO cheesy...just decadent! I made it exactly as the recipe is written, feta cheese and all. I love feta cheese! It didn't taste strange at all with the other cheeses and the green chile peppers. I highly recommend this recipe, and will make it again and again! Thanks so MUCH for the great recipe!

I love this recipe!!  It is so hearty, and extremely easy to make. I made two cause I make slices in the morning and eat it on my way to work when I am in a hurry, which is most of the time.  The only thing I did different is, I added mushrooms, and I had a ham steak that I cut into bite size pieces, and it was really delicious. Next time I might try ground sausage.  Love this thanks alot

This was really good.  I left out the feta and added shitake mushrooms.  We had it for dinner, although I think it would be delicious for breakfast too.

I substituted goat for the feta cheese. Next time I would only use a pinch of onions and would have added another vegetable! It was almost like onion quiche.

This recipe is great. I agree with the previous rating in the fact that I don't think feta would go to well with green chile.  The only recommendation I would make is make sure you use a deep dish pie crust and place on a cookie sheet for baking.  I used the cookie sheet, luckily, but it spilled over so I didn't have much egg mixture after that. Still tasted great though!

I added jalepenos, and garlic. Used canned green chiles because I didn't have fresh and used more eggs(6 instead of 3). I also made it crust less, but it came out amazing!!

This is a great recipe - I have made it 2 times.  My changes are this: DO NOT ADD feta Use only 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup.  I got a lot of compliments on this dish. I think it's a great base for a quiche   BTW - crumbled bacon might be good on top - but I haven't tried it yet.

Family loved it!  A little salty for me but using fresh green chilies should take care of that.  A definite keeper.

Delicious! I agree that feta is not the right flavor for this. I used hatch chiles (roasted, that I froze for later) and queso fresco cheese (rather than feta) and it was perfect. Creamy and flavorful. Perfect for breakfast too. A keeper!
