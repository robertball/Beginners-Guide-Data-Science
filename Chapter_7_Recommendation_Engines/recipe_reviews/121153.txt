These were very good.  I didnt have lemon juice so I used some 1 teaspoon lemon extract, it worked great.  Also after pouring the cheesecake over the crust I added some strawberry jelly and made swirls.  Tasted like strawberry lemonade.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good.  I didn't have whipping cream so I used sour cream.
