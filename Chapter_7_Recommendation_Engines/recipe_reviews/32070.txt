I made some changes to the recipe, and I was very satisfied with the results.  I used one large, unpeeled, garden fresh zucchini (about 16" long).  I cut off the ends, cut it in half, and then sliced it into long slices about 1/4" thick.  (The next time I make it I will also remove the zucchini seeds.) I subtituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and egg beaters for the egg whites. Because I did not have fresh herbs on hand, I used one tbsp. of dried parsley and one tsp. of sweet basil.  I used bottled spagetti sauce.  I will definitely make it again.

I only loosely follow recipes, as I did with this one, and it came out great.  I didn't bother with the eggs or breading procedure at all.  I used considerably more garlic and basil from the garden.  I used only 2 cups of sauce and only 1 cup of ricotta as the recipe seems to call for far too much in my opinion.  Though I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, this was probably one of the best dishes I have made.

Mmmmmm, yummy!  I've made this dish 4 times and everyone loves it.  This last time I used cottage cheese because its a little bit healthier and less expensive than ricotta.  We actually liked the cottage cheese better, you just need to drain out a little of the cottage cheese juice before mixing it up.  Also I used dried parsley and basil and it still tasted great.  Try this dish!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and fried the zucchini slices instead of baking them...Don't do it!  It took forever to fry everything up.  I regretted not baking them...it would have been quicker and healthier.  I also used an italian cheese blend instead of just mozzarella and felt the need to add more spices to the cheese and breadcrumb mixtures.  And 2 Chernobyl sized zucchinis were more than enough.  I also used 3 full eggs instead of 2 egg whites to coat the zucchini slices for breading and 3 full eggs instead of 6 whites for the cheese mixture.  It was a lot of work; it tasted good; but I am struggling to say it was worth the work.  I will try this again, but I will bake the zucchinis and maybe that will streamline the process enough for me.

Really tasty. We loved the breadcrumb topping. Filling but not heavy. However,15 mins prep time is not accurate... more like 30-40 mins. Overall, great, easy recipe, will definitely make it again.

Great way to use up those large zucchinis! I used cottage cheese, bottled spaghetti sauce and 3 whole eggs. Like lasagna, this serves up better if you give it 15 minutes to 'set' after coming out of the oven. In deference to husband, I replaced some zucchini slices with a couple pork cutlets - crumbed & baked alongside the zucchini, they turned out perfect. And adding meat meant it counted as a main dish :) Next time I'll reduce the parmesan in the crumbs, and use dried basil & garlic powder. To the cheese mixture I'm adding minced garlic, fresh basil, s&p, and the 1/2 cup of parmesan reserved from the crumbs. Yum!

This was even better last night (the 2nd time I made it)  Made my own version of 2 large servings, and it turned out less soupy.  Used 1/3 cup dry bread crumbs, 1/3 cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese (for the Parm), garlic powder, dried spices, 3/8 cup egg whites (divided), and 12 oz. zucchini.  Really blotted the juice out of a cup of cottage cheese, and boiled an 8 oz. can of no-salt added tomato sauce to reduce it.  Used 2/3 of a cup of a combo of mozzarella and provolone cheeses (ran out of mozzarella).  Layered it in a glass loaf pan, and baked it 35 minutes at 400 degrees.  IT WAS SUPER EXCELLENT--a little juicy on the bottom, but what else could one expect, with that layer of tomato sauce on the botton???  YUM, YUM, YUM.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dish came out perfectly, with delicious breading and tender zucchini.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

This was so good.  I browned the breaded zucchini slices in a frying pan instead of baking them (sprayed each side with olive oil cooking spray).  I also used 3 whole eggs instead of 6 egg whites in the ricotta mixture, and used 2 whole eggs for breading the zucchini.  And I added some parmesan cheese to the ricotta cheese and used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  This is a great way to use up extra zucchini and would also be good with eggplant.  This is a definite keeper!

Everyone has their own way of making eggplant parm or lasagna but this recipe is a good stepping stone to making it yours. I didn't measure anything but did use all the ingredients listed. With all the zucchini that's growing in the garden this was a delish way to use it. Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious. My husband said it is his favourite zucchini dish ever, and my daughter wanted to make sure there would be leftovers to eat later. The only change I made was to use whole eggs instead of egg whites - 1 for the egg wash and 4 added to the ricotta filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT!  Really a "fool proof" recipe.  Even though I usually grow my own zucchini, none this year.  This recipe came via email and as we had to go shopping, my wife said let's try it!  However, I forgot the size/number of zukes and got four medium sized;  they were the perfect amount!  OOPS!  forgot the ricotta.. used 1% cottage cheese, drained.  Followed all other instructions, baked a bit longer and VOILA!  We're having leftovers (plan aheads by my in-laws speak) and expect to finish it off!

Good, could use a bit of spicing up, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I scaled the recipe down for 2 servings because it was just me eating it tonight, and I used fat free mozzarella and cottage cheese for the ricotta.   I also used left over sauce from last nights chicken cacciatore.  Having this day be one of the worst (other than death) ever, meaning NOT ONE single thing went right for me today, it turned out nice, thanks Jennifer!

Wonderful Recipe!  I made it for my roomates and it came out awesome!  The breading didn't really stay on after the entire meal was cooked, but it still tasted wonderful!  The ricotta added substance and sweetness.  Loved it and can't wait to make it again!

Don't know what the benefit of breading and cooking the zucchini first is.  Will not do it again, just will cook in a pan with a little olive oil.  Need to double all spices.  Added 2 tsp. garlic to ricotta and cheese mixutre.  Will make again with major tweaking.

this is delicious! the only problem i had with the recipe is that the zucchini makes it soupy.. i wouldnt serve it to guests, but my family LOVED it! I used only 2 cups of ricotta, 2 eggs for the breading and 2 eggs for the ricotta mixture. im not sure how to make it less soupy because zucchini is a very watery vegetable. I used dried parsley.. yummy!

This was a nice alternative to a traditional lasagna, however it was somewhat bland.  The only changes I made were to use my own homemade marinara sauce and to cut the recipe in half.  I followed all other directions. I felt there was too much ricotta adding weight to the lasagna.  This was a time intensive recipe that I think will not be repeated in my home.  BF and I both added additional spices at the table (I added hot pepper flakes, he added frank’s hot sauce.)  I’ll stick with the cooking light version of zucchini parmesan.

This is very refreshing. I didn't coat the zucchini because I was in a bit of a hurry and it still tasted great.

Even better when you add slices of fresh tomatos in season like Jersey Beefsteaks. Also fresh grated nutmeg and fresh parsley in the ricotta adds that restaurant quality taste!

Loved this recipe.  Next time I'll use a 8 X 8 pan as the 9 X 13 was way too big.  Can't wait to make this for company.

Great recipe.  The only change I made (because I like to make the recipes as is before making any changes) was to add slices of fresh tomatos as an additional layer over the cheese.  It was very satisfying and filling and made plenty for leftovers.  I bet adding green or black olives would be great.

I have never been a big fan of zucchini, but this dish was absolutely delicious!  My husband raved about it and was so happy that I made extras so he could take it to work with him for lunch.  The only downside for me is that it takes quite a long time to make.  It's easy, it just takes time.  But the taste far outweighs any prep time that goes into making it.  Definitely a recipe I'll make again!

Wow, I really liked this!  I did get in a hurry and screw up (didn't mix the parm & spices in with the dry bread crumbs to dip the zucchini), so I ended up mixing that in with the egg and ricotta.  It still turned out amazing.

very good. I both baked and pan cooked my zucchini to see which was easier (based on others comments). It was easier to cook in a skillet with some olive oil. I mixed my ricotta cheese with low fat sour cream. I also added some salt. I will make this again.

I made my own sauce (Marinara Sauce II), instead of using just tomato sauce, which made this a five star tasting dish.  With only tomato sauce it is only four stars, imo.   I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, just because I already had it.  I had to use dried parsley, rather than fresh.  I halved this recipe, and baked it in a 7x11 size pan, it only took 30 mins in the oven.  This is a good meatless meal that I will make again!

I followed the recipe but cut it in half for just two of us. And there is still plenty left! I did cut down on fat and calories by using low fat mozzarella cheese and fat free ricotta cheese which I dont usually do but with so many other ingredients, it tasted great! The only thing I will do different next time (and there will be a next time) is to add an additional layer of sauce. Very yummy overall!

This was a great recipe & one a cook can customize easily. I used garden zucchini & herbs which resulted in a fresh, flavorful dish.

This was ok, but it is workable. I think i will do away with the breadcrumbs all together next time. I also sauteed onion and garlic in oilve oil and added them to the layers. I love zucchini and onions together so that was just a personal preference. I will try again without all the bread crumb prep.

Really good, I've made is a few times now.  All with different variations.  I don't think you can mess it up.  I think there's too much cheese in the recipe, and not enough zucchini.

So delicious! I went nuts with the breading and the baking of the zucchini, so the whole preparation took about 2 hours. I realized after the fact that what I could have done was sliced up the zucchini, dunked them in the egg whites, put them in a bag with bread crumbs and shaken the bags so to evenly coat the zucchini. I am going to try it next time. I also subsituted the cottage cheese for the ricotta, and it definitely made it lighter.   I am making it again for a party!

I used Italian style bread crumbs to add more taste to the dish.  I also used less tomato sauce  and started with a layer of bread crumbs to soak up the juices so it's not so runny. I didn't bother doing the dipping the slices in the egg and the bread crumbs. I baked the zucchini slices for about 10 minutes.  They will finish cooking in the oven with the rest of the ingredients.

My husband and I did not like this at all.  I think there was way too much riccotta in it and not enough flavor in the dish at all.  All you could really taste was the bread crumbs on the slices of zucchini.  I think if you used a jar sauce instead of just tomato sauce, maybe it would be better?  For all the work that goes into egging and breading the zucchini slices before baking and the outcome that you get, I won't be making this again.

Loved this recipe! I might have used more cheese (cause I didn`t measure it) which might have taken away some of the "healthiness" but this is delicious! I used dry spices cause didn't have fresh, used a classico tomato sauce (with basil), cottage cheese and whole eggs instead of egg whites (would not know what to do with all those yolks after), it is great! Will definitely make again..

The concept of this recipe is great but I'd make a few changes if I ever make it again. First, I'd put more zucchini in the recipe and make sure they are really crispy (maybe fry them instead of baking them). I'd also cut the ricotta in half and not cook it as long (the zucchini was too limp and mushy). 

Like I said, I loved the concept and the overall flavor was good, just too much ricotta and the zucchini was too mushy.

This was excellent definitely a keeper. Mine was not soggy like some reviews complained of. I did bake the slices slightly longer then called for. They were browned nicely. Baked the 45 minutes and let sit ten. Will make this again.

Perfect way to use up zucchini! This is a great alternative to eggplant, and turned out delicious. I was a little worried that the zucchini would be soggy when cooked in the oven, but it wasn't at all. In fact, I might cook zucchini that way in the future and just eat it plain!

This was easy AND delicious.  A neighbor gave me one of those giant "what the heck do you do with it" zucchinis.  I decided to try this recipe.  I made the recipe larger as I had a big zucchini, and a lasagna pan to bake it in.  I used cottage cheese rather than ricotta and it came out perfectly.  A big hit with the family, and even gave some to the neighbor, if he promised not to share any more baseball bat sized vegetables.  grins.

This does take a lot of time, so don't expect to get it on the table for a quick dinner or lunch.  It is, however, very good.  I think I'd either use more zucchini next time or use a smaller dish--not enough zucchini in the dish itself in my opinion.  I sliced thin and in small pieces--I actually think I should've done bigger pieces-maybe just used slices from the whole zucchini (I cut in half, then sliced).  I don't like using egg and dipping in bread crumbs (just a quirk of mine), so I just coated the zucchini in olive oil and then put the breading in a ziploc bag with the zucchini and shook to coat.  It worked well but I ended up with a lot of breading, so I used the breading as an additional layer.  I'd mix the cheese and spaghetti sauce layers next time--just a personal preference for making the layering less time consuming.  This is very soupy, but I love the tomato sauce taste so I probably wouldn't change that.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this was great, my husband especially loved it! Made it pretty much following the recipe other than the eggs. As another person said I just used a couple of eggs for the breading and then 3 for the cheese mixture. I also used my preferred brand of bottled spaghetti sauce. It does take some time but it was well worth it!

Like other reviewers, my dish came out soupy.  It was good as leftovers (the fridge helped solidify it) and it was still pretty good as the main course.  I added mushrooms, extra seasonings, and used cottage cheese, spaghetti sauce, garlic powder, and dried herbs.  Next time I’ll use a smaller baking dish since I felt that the four zucchinis I used were not enough to adequately fill the large dish.  I’ll also put a layer of bread crumbs in the bottom of the baking dish to try and absorb some of the liquid and will try adding a small can of tomato paste to see if that helps with excess liquid.  I’ll also use less of the bread crumb mixture on top as I thought it was a bit much and took away from the taste of the dish.  I may sweat the zucchini next time as well.  Despite these changes, it wasn’t a bad recipe.  It’s a good starting point and I’d try it again.

Tried this yesterday, was a bit disappointed as we found it rather bland.  I will give it another bash, and try out some of the tips other users have mentioned, and just add more seasoning along the way.

This dish turned out really well!  I have to agree with the reader who posted that prep time is more like 30-40 minutes instead of 15.  Slicing and dicing everything and baking the zucchini slices took some time, but I think it was worth it.  

I added more mozzerella than called for ~ I bought 2 packages of the shredded kind and used a package per "layer".  I also needed more than 2 egg whites to dip the zucchini in before dredging in the bread crumb mixture.  My messy hands were getting bread crumbs in the egg whites and the egg whites were soaking into the bread crumbs!

I recommend serving this dish with garlic toast - my husband LOVED piling the zucchini parmigiana on top of the toast and eating it like that.

Next time, I think I will try using dried herbs (just so I don't have to make special trips to the grocery store to buy fresh herbs) and throwing in a few things I have in the pantry.  This is a super-versatile dish!

DELICIOUS! I used cottage cheese and would prefer to have not done the breading.

I thought this was excellent.  It was really good left over too.  I did not use quite as much cheese or eggs as directed.  My sister in law said that it was "epic".  She would have given it five stars.  My entire family loved it.  Perfect for all that extra zucchini in the garden.

Excellent flavor.  I only had one large zucchini, so I halved the recipe.  There was still plenty for the family.  Also used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta.  Will definitely make this again.

This did not taste good at all. We ordered pizza for dinner because no one in my family liked it. I think using spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce would have improved it. But really similar recipes using eggplant are much better.

Delicious! I hate zuchinni, so when a friend gave me some i had to find something that sounded okay to do with it. zucchini bread? boring!!! this was AWESOME! I will certainly make it again. I used the whole wheat ritz crackers as in an earlier review, and a little less ricotta. I was shocked at how tasty this dish is. YUMMY!

This is a lot of work, but worth it.  Tastes delicious.  I used cottage cheese.
(Be careful about changing the serving sizes.  It does NOT calculate correctly and the instructions don't match at all.)

Nice recipe! I only made two changes: I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoes, and cottage cheese instead of ricotta, same amounts called for. Set up very nice and had lots of good flavor! Definitely a keeper!!

My husband raved on and on about this dish. I didn't quite follow the recipe to a "T". I doubled the recipe ingredients, used 5 zucchini's and I didn't have tomato sauce so I used only 1 jar of Ragu mushroom spaghetti sauce. I also had to use a larger pan and it JUST fit! It was wonderful! My husband thought it was vegetable lasagna at first. Will make again for sure!

I was really excited to try this recipe because I thought it would be fun to use up my Zucchini in an Italian sort of way.  I was REALLY disappointed.  
My son who LOVES lasagna type dishes didnt even finish his plate.  My husband and I finally scraped the top layer off and just ate the Zucchini with some of the sauce. 
The big problem was the top crust.  It was overpowering and sort of turned mushy.  Then I think that the Ricotta cheese and egg mixture was a bit to much.  If I made this again I would probably cut it in half.  I did like the breaded Zucchini. I thought about just making the breaded Zucchini, cooking it in the oven as recipe reads and then serving it over some pasta with spaghetti sauce. 
I am giving this recipe 2 stars just because I found a good breading for Zucchini that can be used in a different way.

Followed the directions nearly as written, but just a smaller portion. Just one large zucchini was just right for our side dish and we LOVED it. I will make this again!

yummy.  my hubby doesn't like my veggie lasagna, but he loved this! I used zucchini & yellow squash. I think I'll try it with spaghetti sauce next time. Maybe I'll try just cooking the zucchini & crumb mix in a pan and stirring it occasionally rather than dipping each slice in egg and coating it.

The 15 minute prep time was way off (maybe it's just me, I'm no chef), but the dish was a huge hit! This will become a regular addition to dinner here.

I'm on the low carb diet and being an Italian girl, it's killing me! But this recipe was great because I felt like I was getting my big pasta meal! So easy to make, and a great way to use up the extra zucchini from my garden. I added more cheese (hey, I'm not eating pasta!) and more sauce, and it turned out FANTASTIC. I also added some sauteed onions to the ricotta mixture and used all fresh basil, oregano and parsley. Totally worth your time to make this. Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

I adore this recipe.  I added some garlic salt and oregano to the ricotta mixture and also added one small summer squash because I have a ton on hand.  I love this and will be using up my zucchinis and summer squash on this recipe for years to come.  Thanks!

I've done this 2 ways. Baked the zucchini as it says in this recipe. I've also fried the breaded zucchini. Both delicious, obviously the fried version is tastier. I use mozzarella instead of ricotta or cottage cheese. Stick to a traditional lasagna style recipe. Add in my own amount of basil and parsley and I make my own sauce.

easy, perfect, and healthier than a lasagna with noodles.  There is no frying and the low fat cheese made it healthier however, i think it would be better with not using the low fat cheese!!!

AWESOME recipe!  So yummy.  I made it and halved the recipe because I'm the only one in my family that will eat it, and the only modification I did was used whole egg, instead of whites. So I used 2 eggs for the zucchinis, and 2 eggs in the ricotta mixture.  It was perfect and SO YUMMY!  A little longer than 15 min to prep, but worth it! Thank you!

Wow, sooo good. Unfortunately, I halved the recipe since we never had it before so didn't know how it would be liked. Boy, it was loved.  I followed instruction fully, except used whole eggs. Wasn't soggy at all. New favourite!

This recipe was delicious, and was a great way to use up our large garden zucchini.  Even my husband, who said he is tired of zucchini, liked this dish.  I used 4 whole eggs, instead of the egg whites, and otherwise followed the recipe.  I wasn't sure if I should slice the zucchini into circular slices, or slice it lengthwise.  Since I was using a long, fat zucchini (about 17"long), I made large circular cuts.  Next time I will try slicing lengthwise.  I do recommend not skipping the breading step.  It adds flavor, and helps prevent the soupiness a few people complained about.  My zucchini parmigiana was not soupy at all.  The flavors in this dish worked well together.  I froze half, and look forward to enjoying the remainder of it in the Winter when we will miss our abundance of garden zucchini!

This was very good!  It is a bit soft since there is no meat in it to give it substance.  There was a bit too much topping on mine and not enough sauce; that part was my fault.  I think I'd slice my zucchini a bit thicker next time too since the other flavors are strong; you almost don't even see or taste the zucchini in it which may be a good or bad thing for some!.. :)

This is the first recipe I reviewed and found it easy , even if it does take a bit longer to prepare.  I added in a box of frozen broccoli for an added vegetable and I think this was beneficial for the recipe.

I made this exactly like the recipe except sub. drained cottage cheese and used less whole eggs vs. egg whites. This was not good at all. The zuchinni is delicious when breaded but when you put it in dish it turns very soggy! If more seasoning were added and alot less sauce it might be ok.

I am Italian and grew up eating authentic home-made Italian food. This recipe was DECLICIOUS!!! I re-scaled the recipe for 5 people and everything came out perfect. Only thing I modified was using 3 whole eggs instead of seperating the whites, part skim ricotta to cut down on calories/fat, and baked for 35 mins instead of 45. I also used both zucchini and squash. Put some ziti noodles with some of the leftover marinara on the side and ate this as the main course. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

Great recipe, rich and full flavoured. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and worked well.

Good tasting dish and my family really liked it.  The next time I will make sure the zucchini is baked until it is crisp, which is my personal taste.

I made this without any modifications and it was lacking flavor! My husband said it had no flavor and needed meat!

The main issue I had with this recipe was that my zucchini was tough. I don't know if it didn't cook long enough, if I should've peeled it, or what. I did use the other half of the zucchini for cookies and they turned out wonderful, so,...? I suppose I could have cut the zucchini slices smaller but then I would've been coating them all night long. My husband said I should've just made lasagna.... I won't be making this again, that's for sure!

Great base recipe.  I cut my zucchini into rounds - takes less prep time and easier to serve.  Also find that adding large pieces of fresh mushroom to the sause gives the texture of meat.  Adding other vegetables, such as yellow squash or well drained frozen spinich adds additional color (just becareful of to much water content.)
