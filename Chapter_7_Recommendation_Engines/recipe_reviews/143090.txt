I made this tonight, and it was great.  I didn't have the peanut oil, and potato starch, so I substituted canola oil, and corn starch.  My husband, and I loved it. It wasn't that time consuming to make, but it definetly was a good deal of clean up.

We moved to the midwest from CA some years ago and get serious unfulfilled cravings for decent Chinese food - finally I decided I would just have to learn to cook it myself. This recipe was my first attempt and it was actually very good! It was all the wonderful flavors I remember from Chinese restaurants on the coast and WAY better than any of the slop they sell out here.

I made some minor changes depending on what I had to work with. I couldn't find potato starch to save my life, so I used tempura flour / rice flour. It seemed to fall off a bit during frying so I'd try the potato starch if you can get it, but the pork still turned out great and what remained of the batter was delicious. I  added in baby carrots with the other veggies as I love carrots in my sweet and sour pork - they were great! I thought the sauce needed a little extra citrus kick, a little perking up and brightening, so I added about 1/4 cup of grapefruit juice that I had in the fridge and it was just awesome and perfect. Finally I couldn't find any hot peppers at any grocers here (you see what I mean about where I live) so I went with dried ground cayenne. It was a bit too spicy, not quite the right flavor... but still good. If you have to use the dried spice stuff instead of fresh, it will work and be tasty, just make sure you don't overdo it.

As far as the recipe goes, it was delightful! It was a lot of work to do but none of it was difficult to manage. The pork turned out WONDERFUL, crunchy on the o

Was looking for recipe to use up some pork i had that was defrosted and this popped up, so decided to take a chance with this recipe only having one review. 

Well just finished making this dish, and i can say i will definitely make it again.

Awesome dish.

I went lighter on the oil and only used about 1/2cup for cooking, and coated my pork is flour instead of potato starch because that was what i had on hand (yeah even ran out of corn starch as well)

and opted for apple cider vinegar for a bit more flavor.


definitely give this recipe a try

Thanks, Betsy - Great recipe! I have another excellent S&S Pork recipe from this site, but was intrigued with the double-frying of the pork in this one. Being a true carnivore, I used 2+ pounds of pork (boneless country ribs, trimmed of fat), so I doubled the marinade and the egg for dredging. Everything else was kept as written. The pork bits had a very nice crunch to them and the sauce was not the sickeningly-sweet stuff that so many recipes make. At first, I thought there might be a little too much vinegar in the sauce, but even that ended up just right. I served the sauce over rice, topped that with the pork bits, then drizzled a little more sauce over the pork. My guest said she has never had such well balanced flavor in a sweet and sour dish. PS: I really couldn't tell the difference in the crunch between the pork bits that had been fried twice versus those that had had taken only one trip through the hot oil, but it may be more in the way they absorb (or rather, do not absorb) the sauce.

I have been yearning for a sweet & sour recipe that rivals my favorite Chinese restaurant in London's Chinatown, and I think I have found it! I improvised a bit to assure the meat would stay crispy by only adding the meat on top of the sauce at serving time (not stirring it in and cooking as the recipe states). I also improvised due to the lack of some of the ingredients. I stir fried the bell pepper with carrots and yellow onions, and my pineapple substitute was pineapple chutney but I could have skipped it all together as the sauce was sweet enough without it. Thanks Betsey for a new way to cook the same old pork chop!

This was awesome!  Thanks for a great recipe, Betsy.  I used cornstarch in place of potato starch and simply rolled the marinated pork pieces directly in it, skipping the egg bath.  This worked out well and saved significant time.  I also forewent the double frying of the pork.  Even after these modifications, this was still a 5 star recipe all the way.  Bravo!

Yummy!  I did have the potato starch (also called potato flour) and never did anything with it, so this recipe was an eye opener for it's use.  The potato starch makes it really crispy, instead of soggy like regular wheat flour can get once it is mixed with a sauce.  The only changes I made was that I used a small onion that I did a rough 1/2" chop on instead of the green onions and I left out the cayenne peppers, only because I didn't have them.  I suppose I could have substituted some Siracha hot sauce, but it was so good without it, I didn't add it.  I also used half a red bell pepper in addition to the green pepper.  I would suggest that you do all of your chopping ahead of time so that when your frying is done you are ready to stir fry the veggies.  My husband loved it, and thinks it's better than a restaurant dish!

My family really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I only fried the pork once and did not add cayenne peppers.  It was still delicious.  I thought that the sauce was pretty thin before I added the pork back in, but it was actually just right.  Will be making this again!

I love sweet and sour pork but I have had never been able to find a recipe that comes close to a restaurant. Every recipe I have ever tried turns out disgusting so I stopped trying. The sweet and sour sauce alone in this recipe is so yummy. I double it so I have plenty to put on the meat. It looks thin, but when you add it to the meat, it thickens. It is soooo good. We eat it at least once every couple of weeks unless I crave it earlier. This is the first review I have ever written. It was that good. I didn't have any of the special oils so I just used veg. oil  when it called for peanut or sesame. I also just use stew meat for the meat. It might be better the way the recipe is written but this works for us.

Beeeuatiful dish! Couple of changes - added bean sprouts to bring up the veggie level. Doubled the sauce but found that it was not necessary - next time I won't. Used corn starch.  The pork was sooo good! Takes a little time to prep/cook the pork but was well worth it.

Great recipe.  To shorten prep time I just beat the egg directly over the pork, then placed the pork pieces in a bag to shake the coating.  I also used only a tsp of oil in a non-stick frying pan to pan-fry the pork instead of deep frying.

Good recipe; I did use a couple of adaptions, substituting corn starch for potato starch, sesame oil for the peanut oil (used what I had on hand) & I threw in some sesame seeds. Oh yeah, instead of white vinegar, I used some of my homemade raspberry vinegar and I added some pineapple juice to the sauce.  It was really good, considering I used left over fried pork chops cutting them up for the stir fry & served over rice.

Lacking in flavor, this was neither sweet nor sour.  I followed the recipe almost exactly--just adding some carrots and celery to fill out the veggie content.  Sweet and Sour Pork III is a much tastier and easier recipe and I will be going back to it for my sweet and sour fix next time.

Love this recipe. Very easy to make, though I think next time I will cut down on the sugar just a little (maybe 1 Tablespoon less.) Great recipe!

I thought this was really, really good. I used a 4oz diced can of pineapple & added the juice only to the sauce portion. I used cider vinegar instead of white. Served over brown rice , sprinkled with green onions. Bon Appetit!

An absolute favorite in our house. I cannot believe that the sauce I have been trying to copy for years is basically just ketchup, sugar and vinegar! Using the potato starch makes it crunchy yet light. Instead of 2 cups oil, I only used enough oil to cover the bottom of a small pan and, in batches, cooked the pork, flipping it half way through cooking. As well, I did not mix the meat into the sauce but served on the plate beside rice covered in the sauteed veggies and sauce.

I did not particularly care for sweet and sour chicken or pork because it was always to cloyingly sweet.  This was the best I have ever tasted and I am now a fan.

I made this last night for my parents.  We are in Costa Rica now so I couldn't get some of the ingredients.  Needless to say there are no Chinese Restaurants here!  My father said this was the best sweet sour pork he has ever had, and since he is retired military and has been all over the world that's really saying something!  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Perfect recipe! I made this without pineapple because I can't eat it, and I was totally dubious about that, but it turned out perfectly.  I also used corn starch, and I didn't have eggs so I just threw the marinated pork in corn starch, and it worked perfectly. It was crispy and so delicious. I used celery, white onions and canned mushrooms because that was all the veggies I had on hand, and yes, that IS enough marinade, which I doubted at first.  Will for sure make this again, it's nice to have another recipe for pork that won't dry it out.

The flavour was excellent. It's spicy and sweet...it wasn't sour at all. But it tasted really good anyway. Even my mom liked it and she doesn't like anything other than what we eat everyday (indian food).  I followed the recipe almost exactly with the following changes: I didn't have peanut oil or sesame oil so I used regular vegetable oil for both. Also, we don't eat pork so I substituted with chicken breast. I didn't have cayenne peppers, so I used 1 Thai hot pepper from our garden (spicy!)  Served it with rice. Everyone loved it. It was gone in a day! I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe! Very easy. I did not use 2 cups of peanut oil - only 1/2 cup in a frying pan. I also didn't use an egg as the pork was moist from marinating. Used cornstarch instead of potato starch. The pork turned out to be amazing! So did the sauce. I followed the directions for the sauce closely - just instead of 2 Tablespoons white vinegar I did 1 Tablespoon white vinegar, 1/2 T white wine vinegar and 1/2 T rice wine vinegar. Will definitely be making this again! As others have mentioned, the flavors were very well balanced.

Used cornstarch and canola oil and frozen stir-fry blend vegtables.  Served over rice.  This was sooooooo good.  Just like the chinese food restaurant.

Overall I really like this recipe. Easy to put together compared to some asian type recipes. I dislike thick sauces and this one is just right. Looks a little runny when cooking but by the time you add the port and veggies then on to the plate its the right consistency. Great flavor too and I did not add the red food coloring. Only variations I did as I did not have potato starch. I used corn starch for the sauce and marinade. I used King Arthur flour for the pork - still came out very crunch and great texture once the sauce was added. Love this recipe and will add it to my reliable favs.

I first learned to make this  in Korea..it is delicious...I lost the recipe on my move back to the USA..so glad to "find" it again!! (corn starch is agreat substitute for the potatoe starch, and for less thick coating, dip the pork right into the starch from the marinade. omitting the egg.

I used leftover pork roast and really squeezed the pork balls tight with the starch.  Used corn starch as I didn't have potato starch.  This had the family raving about this recipe.  Unbelievably good.

I couldn't find pototo starch so I substituted a mixture of corn starch and all-purpose flour.  This is a great recipe.

an amazing recipe! this marks the very first chinese dish i ever cooked :D It was a big hit with my family. My bro was quite surprised (in a good way) with the ingredients, especially the ketchup for the sauce. I cooked it with chicken, worked like a charm.

Bought canned pineapple CHUNKS instead and eliminated the step of cutting up the pineapple slices.  Recipe for the sauce requires a cup of water but I used the pineapple juice from the can in place of the water that is required in the sauce.  Had to add a touch more of water to get it to 1 cup.

Came out great but had to use a different pan to cook everything in. The wok was too small to hold all of the ingredients and have them cooked evenly. I added a bit of sriracha to give it a good kick and some peanuts for crunch.

This was very good though something overall was lacking - I think adding at least 2-4 tbsp soy sauce to the sauce would fix it. (A Chinese cook told us to mix the meat with soy sauce, a bit of sugar, then adding cornstarch). Because I was giving this recipe the best test, I happened to have an egg white on hand so I used that rather than a whole egg, and as others did, I used cornstarch rather than potato starch.  I had only vegetable oil, which I use in most of my Chinese cooking.  Quite quick to put together once the cooking starts.  As others recommended, I didn't combine the meat with the sauce until I was ready to sit down to eat.  Lovey crisp morsels of pork.  I served this dish with rice.  I'm keeping this recipe in my arsenal of Chinese recipes.  Thank you to the recipe poster.

Like many other reviewers, I used corn starch rather than potato starch. The sauce was outstanding. But we like our pork tender, juicy, and 130 degrees. This was neither tender, nor juicy, nor 130 degrees. Next time, I'll make 3-4X the marinade and marinate for several hours. And I'll test the pork temperature after 3-3 1/2 minutes of cooking.Or I may try pork tenderloin. With these refinements for our personal taste, I think this would be 5 stars.

It was pretty good, but not exceptional. Much like what you'd get from Chinese take-out. From start to finish it took me almost 2 hours to prepare. Not good enough for me to want to go through the trouble of making it again.

Absolutely wonderful. Do not skip the double fry, or sub something else for potato starch - it will not turn out the same! Potato starch adds better color, and can take higher heat than corn starch. The pineapple made it very sweet. I might up the vinegar slightly next time for more bite, but that's just personal preference. Made exactly according to the recipe with some sugar snap peas on the side rather than change the proportions of the recipe.

1st time making it  . I used pineapple juice in the sauce and used cornstarch and instant potatoes to roll the pork in it made it extra crunchy.  My girlfriend said it was better than any restaurant she ever had.

This was my second time preparing this dish.  It is AMAZING!  I add diced sweet pickles and maraschino cherries for both colour and sweetness.  I also poured about 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice into the sauce.   Used cayenne flakes instead of actual peppers.   I served it with coconut rice.   Very nice meal!

good balance of sweet and sour.  Added a can of sliced water chestnuts with the other veggies for some crunch.  Also added a little corn starch and a little red pepper to the sauce ( to make up for the onission of the fresh cayenne pepper in the vegies)to the sauce to thicken it and then did not add in the pork until right at the end to keep it crisp.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper and enjoy.

I made this as directed except substituting regular flour for some of the potato starch and using corn starch for the rest.  It was very good.  The sauce thickened up nicely.  My son actually went back for seconds.

This really is as good as everyone says.  It's better than what you get at the restaurants, minus the msg!  My kids loved it too.  I only had a little bit of corn starch on hand (no potato starch -- where do you buy that?!?) so I used regular flour for the breading.  Worked great.  Just make sure the oil is hot enough before you add the meat.

Loved this recipe!  It was very simple to make, and the dish tasted heavenly.  It was nicely crispy without the unnecessary breading that usually surrounds the pork.  The marinade really added a lot of flavor to the pork.    I substituted corn starch for the potato starch since I already had it, and it worked great.

Excellent dish! It has a wonderfully complex flavor and is relatively easy to make.  Like some others I coated the pork in cornstarch, it worked nicely and gave it a good crunch.  I used 1/2t ground red pepper and two fresh mild Jalapenos instead of the (unavailable) fresh red chili peppers. It tasted great.  Next time I will definitely double the sauce recipe. The only other thing I think that I did to change it was to add double the ketchup/vinegar & sugar to the sauce. I wanted mine to have a little more of a kick to it.  Thank you so much for a delicious dinner that I will serve again!
