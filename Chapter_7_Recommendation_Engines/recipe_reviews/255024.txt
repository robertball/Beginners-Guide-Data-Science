Very good and super easy to throw together, even at the last minute. I used vegan butter and vegetable broth. Thank you for the recipe.

Good soup. Will probably add some coconut milk to make it creamier and fattier next time.

This is great! I changed it up a hair. Instead, I used tbs of red curry paste, used garlic salt in place of the salt, and added some crushed red pepper. I like some heat. But oh my! THIS is GOOD!

An easy, delicious way to use a bumper crop of zucchini.  This will be in regular rotation at our house.
