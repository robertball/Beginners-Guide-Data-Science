It needed a lot more flavor than just a pinch of the spices. I used 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 t of the other spices, and it still could have used more.

This is an easy, hands-off way to make oatmeal.  The pinch of ginger, cloves, and nutmeg is too imperceptible to even notice, so I would add 2-3 pinches next time. Also for my taste, I need a little more brown sugar. These things are easy to personalize for each individual's taste. The liquid to oats ratio and the cook time are perfect. I added cream and toasted walnuts right before serving.
