I made this for my grandmother's 84th birthday,because she use to love Tippin's peanut butter pie.  Their pie had a custard like filling and no chocolate in it.  So when I found this recipe I thought, this is the one.  And it was close with some tweaking to it.  I followed the directions exactly how it was written.  I stirred the milk,egg,flour and sugar mixture for 45 minutes and it never thickened to more than a little thicker than pancake batter.  I poured it into the pie shell and it never set.  After 2 hours it was still less than pudding like consistency.  At that point I was running short on time and thought it can't hurt if I bake it.  Which I did at 350 for 1 hour, I covered the crust with foil and after an hour it was perfect.  It had the consistency of a pumpkin pie.  Everyone thought it was great and ate it all, my grandmother didn't even get a slice.  So I will be making anothr one today.

Wow! This pie was really good. I added a little extra flour and cooked the filling a little bit longer, and it turned out perfect; not runny at all! Thanks for the great recipe!

Good creamy pie....the only thing I would do is add another 1/4 cup of sugar.  Not quite the sweetness levell needed...the pie was very peanut buttery, but needed a bit more sugar.  I don't like those that eat sweets then complain it's too sweet.  It needs to TASTE right.  Overall, good recipe that needs a minor adjustment.

I love this recipe... It is a little time consuming, but is very simple and tastes GREAT... The last one I made I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it is still wonderful... I will be making this again and again...

I thought this was pretty good. We like a strong peanut butter taste and this didn't have it but it wasn't bad either. It took awhile for the mixture to thicken and the directions should be more specific on that. There were a few times I didn't think it was going to get thick and almost gave up.

This peanut butter pie was absolutely delicious and SOOOO easy to make!  I made it with a chocolate pie crust, so it's like a massive peanut butter cup!  I used crunchy peanut butter, an added bonus, and topped it with whipped cream and toffee bits.....mmmmmmmm good!

Wow!  I served this at a group and everyone loved this!  Not too sweet, not too peanut buttery, not too runny, but a smooth pudding-like texture.  Changes I made:  I used 3/4 cup of flour.  Also, I spooned the custard into a prepackaged Oreo crust that I brushed with beaten egg white and pre-baked in a 350 degree oven for 5 minutes.  After reading reviews, I was worried that the custard wouldn't thicken, so what I did was added the sugar and flour to the milk/egg mixture only after a minute or two of cooking this on MEDIUM-LOW heat.  I then brought the heat up to medium for about a minute and then brought it up to medium-high for another minute or two just to get the mixture to warm up.  As soon as it was warm (and before it was simmering or the eggs had a chance to cook), I turned the heat back down to medium-low and continued to cook it.  This whole process took about 10 minutes for it to thicken to a custard before I added the peanut butter and vanilla.  It's important to remember to stir continuously throughout the cooking.  I topped this with homemade sweetened whipped cream, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a few pieces of chocolate that I had melted into shapes.  So good!

this recipe is amazing ! i absolutely loved this pie i was surprised at how quick it thickened, i read the other reviews that said it was time consuming but it thickened in about 10 minutes or less but i also didnt realize i was supposed to boil the milk eggs and salt first then add things in, i added it all together and heated it up and it worked amazing, i also used 1/3 of flour instead of only 1/4  recipe was awesome ! thanks so much :)

I love this recipe and so did my brother, the ultimate peanut butter pie fan! Easy to make! Next time, though, I will probably add just a little more peanut butter.

Turned out perfectly! Whomever said it was too thin must not have followed the directions exactly, or did not cook the filling long enough. This is so much better than the no bake cream cheese kind! Will be adding this to the recipe box and making again!

This recipe is so simple to make and absolutely delicious. I made it for my family Christmas and it was gone in a flash. I have made it three times and use a chocolate graham cracker crust. I sprinkle the whip cream topping with chopped nuts. Thank you for allowing me to make your recipe.

This is the only recipe that I could find that was made with a custard based recipe. I had to use a couple tbs of cornstarch and a little water to thicken it up but it did fine. Next time I’m going to add more peanut butter and less vanilla but overall it was great.

Not a great recipe.  I had to add more flour and more peanut butter.  Didn't set after an hour so I had to bake at 350 for 30 minutes and it was just ok.

While this tasted delicious, it was fairly soupy. It would have been a whole lot better solid. :-) Delicious as is, though!

We enjoyed this pie.  I used a regular, store purchased pie crust.  My turned out to be on the runny side.  It was more of a pudding consistency than pie filling.  I would try to cook it a little longer or add slightly more flour next time.

absolutely delicious.  I used "best ever pie crust" with this pie.  It is so wonderful.  I will try the crahm cracker crust and oreo crust.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Cool whip topping would be great.  I can see all the suggestions made with this pie would be good.  This is a great recipe.

Mmmmm, just as rich and creamy as the recipe says it will be.  I made this for the family I'm staying with in France and they said, "Mmmm, c'est trés bon Charlotte!!"  Yipee!  Thanks alot Jackie for the wonderful recipe.

I loved this!!! I added crunchy peanut butter and I used a oreo pic crust. It was an easy recipe to make. I will make it again.
