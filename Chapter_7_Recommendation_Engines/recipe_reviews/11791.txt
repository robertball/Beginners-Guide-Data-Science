I'm sorry but this carbonara is nothing like a real carbonara. I tried making this last night. The eggs should not be scambled in a pan, they should coat the pasta. It was very dry and bland. Spaghetti Carbonara is my favorite Italian dish. I have tried many. I have lived across the border from Italy and had the real thing. This was far from it. It should not even be in this catagory.

Warning, a look at the nutritional information for this recipe is revealing.  This recipe is estimated to have 62 grams of fat in each serving (the recipe makes six servings for a total of 372 grams of fat).  That's more than an entire pint of ben & jerry's cookie dough in one serving (one sixth of this recipe!)   With the majority of that fat coming from bacon and eggs, this may not be the healthiest meal for children or adults...

That is a huge amount of bacon for six servings, I'd cut it in half. Also, the eggs are tossed with the hot pasta to cook, not scrambled into little lumps.

I used "Italy - the Beautiful Cookbook" & I think the secret for creamy sauce is as given there:- After cooking the pasta RESERVE 1/2cup  OF THE LIQUID. Having cooked the pancetta or bacon & a chopped red chili pepper, mix Pecorino cheese & eggs (it uses just yolks, I use whole eggs) into the reserved cooking water, add a little salt & PLENTY of pepper;  tip the browned bacon (with the fat) over the past, then add the egg mixture & toos well.  Add parmesan & serve.  Delicious. D

I made this recipe for three very picky grandchildren.  Too bad I didn't make more.  They all had seconds and wanted more.  One change I made was adding some minced garlic to the bacon fat.  Next time I will make double because they wanted it for lunch today.  Thanks for the recipe.

Well, Im sorry to not have been in Italy, but for a college guy like me, this stuff is ridiculously delicious!!! I added some lemon pepper, a hint of garlic salt, and some finely grounded basil, the combo was AWESOME!!! Will definitely do the dish again.

My family loved this recipe. I used 6 eggs and thin spaghetti. I also broke my spaghetti into smaller pieces for cooking.

I'll try anything once. It was an easy meal and the bacon makes the flavor. I'd say it's a good recipe for bachelors.

this isn't carbonara at all.  the point of carbonara is to cook the eggs with the residual heat of the pasta.  It may be good but should not be called Carbonara.

I'm sorry, but for real carbonara, you don't scramble the eggs. you cook the pasta and then immediately combine the eggs with the strained pasta, allowing it too cook as you stir it in. Then you add the bacon (with grease) and other ingredients depending on your palate.

This was a great recipe to work with! Since the ingredients and steps were so simple it was easy to make adjustments. Like some other people suggested, I cut the amount of bacon to a little less than a pound, then I used 3/4 cup of Parmesan, and added green and white onions. I also didn’t scramble the egg, but added it to the hot pasta along with some hot pasta water. Overall, this recipe turned out great!

ABsolutely excellent.  Only thing I do differently is make my own pasta! In the magazine, the recipe was changed and  2 T. reserved pasta water is used and the eggs ARE NOT scrambled

I used whole grain spaghetti and turkey bacon.  I also added some sauteed garlic.  I mixed some cooked peas to get some veggies in and it was delicious and a little healthier.  My boyfriend loved it.

I first saw this recipe in the AR Magazine.  They added their own Kitchen note which I did and worked perfectly!  "From our Kitchen:  In Marian's original recipe, she scrambled the eggs before adding them to the pasta, but we found the heat of the pasta cooked the eggs enough to turn them into a creamy sauce instead of chunky pieces.  Marian also called for olive oil, but the drippings from the bacon gave this dish plenty of fat and flavor)"

Delicious! I used all the ingredients but put it together a little differently. When the pasta was done cooking, I drained it and put back in the put over a low heat. Poured in the oil, put in bacon, poured in the beaten raw eggs, poured in the cheese and mixed well for a few minutes. The eggs cooked up sticking to the noodles and was perfect! Already sent this to someone who requested it as they thought it was fabulous!

The only thing I did different was to scramble the eggs in the hot bacon fat, bacon, and spaghetti all at once.  Only used two eggs.  we love this dish.  Easy, economical, and now a family favorite.

a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic are needed to improve this dish. also a little red pepper flakes improve this dish.most people add Alfredo sauce, which is not authentic Italian dish.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the eggs with the spaghetti. Turned  out delicious!
