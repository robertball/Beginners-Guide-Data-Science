When I first cut into the cake I thought that it looked soggy because of the pears but it turned out that although it was quite moist it did still have a firm spring to it. This is the perfect recipe for using up all the canned pears I have in storage and the cinnamon flavored icing was the perfect combination for this cake. The cake itself is not terribly sweet but the icing makes up for it.
