I made this recipe exactly as suggested. However, after everything was assembled in the casserole dish, I realized the recipe never stated when to add the parmesan cheese. So I sprinkled it on top since I didn’t have any other options at that point. However, I am pretty sure it is suppose to be added with the cream to make the sauce more of an alfredo type sauce. Oh well, I hope this helps. This dish had good flavors, but I probably won’t make again.

Fantastic! Thank you so much for enhancing my repertoire of pasta dishes!! My family loved this and hubby went back for seconds... raving about how delicious it is! And for those who don't have heavy cream in the house... I used 2% milk, added about 1/2 cup of butter and some flour and it was thick and creamy and tasted fab! A winner!!!

I followed this recipe somewhat--I added half an onion to the mushroom/garlic mixture while it was sauteing, used a mixture of hot & mild Italian sausage, and I had some oven-roasted red peppers which I cut up and added to the pan when I put the heavy cream & sausage in to make the sauce.  It turned out absolutely fabulous and I will definitely make it again.  Though it's a little high in fat, it's a very delicious recipe.

So, my husband literally inhaled his first plate (are you hungry honey, or did you like it?) inhaled his second plate (i had barely gotten halfway through my first) and even though he said he was full, went in for a third helping. I made the recipe as stated and will definately be making it again. Even my picky 9 year old asked when i would be making it again before he was even done eating....yep, it's a keeper.**update** added some spinach and tomatoes...little bit of basil. tasted great!

I made this for my boyfriend and a friend and we all loved it!! However I didn't measure anything and I used tomato and spinach noodles which added color and I added STEWED TOMATOES and it made the recipe, I poured the can in right before I added the cream and don't drain the juice.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe!!! Everyone loved it!!! I'm just going to make sure I drain the sausage as much as I can to get as much grease out as possible. If you reheat the leftovers it gets pretty greasy. Thanks!!! Will definetley make again!!!

Delicious right out of the oven and even better the second day! I took some into work as well and everyone loved it. I plan to make more and freeze single servings for when I go back to school-so much better than store-bought frozen dinners!

Really great!  Had a bunch of baby portobellos and needed a recipe. Don't usually have heavy cream on hand, but hubby stopped on his way home and was glad he did-loved the meal. This reminds me of an Italian-style stroganoff. I think I could have seasoned with pepper a bit more, but that was my hand not the recipe. Thanks for sharing this one!

As written, it is a 4 star recipe. You only need 1 tbsp of oil when sauteeing the sausage (there's plenty of grease when removing the sausage). I added chopped onions to the garlic and canned mushrooms. I ended up using the entire pint of heavy cream (wanted it really creamy) and thickened it up with corn starch. DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE PARMESAN CHEESE. Used about 6 oz of mozzarella cheese at the end.

What do you do with the Parmesan cheese?
The directions doesn't say, I assume it goes in with the Mozzarella Cheese

I didn't have the heavy cream, and I know the cook who contributed this recipe would be horrified, but I used cream of mushroom soup, turkey sausage, and canned portobello mushrooms, and it STILL turned out really good....I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been with the original ingredients! Yummy~~

Absolutely delicious.  I made this recipe mostly as suggested, but I increased the olive oil and left out the sausage to accommodate a vegetarian friend.  I would probably make a bit more sauce for the amount of pasta the next time, but I can't recommend this recipe highly enough.

This is very yummy. Super easy. Did add extra cheese, cause we're just cheesy kinda people. And few shakes of crushed red pepper. A for sure keeper. Think I'm going to make this for a pot luck next week. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I thought this was fantastic. It tasted like something you would get in a nice Italian restaurant. I had never used Italian sausage before, and I loved it. I used hot Italian sausage and I liked the spice. I also substituted bowtie pasta because I didn't have enough penne pasta, and it still turned out great. I also added the parmesan in with the cream, as other reviewers suggested. Yum!

For mushroom lovers, this your dish! I was worried that the sausage would be overwhelming but found that it tasted more of mushrooms than anything else, which was a-ok with me! Couldn't give it 5 stars because I thought it needed more sauce. Will definitely make again.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I added some Dale's and Old Bay Seasoning to the mushrooms, and used conecuh sausage.  I also made the heavy cream 2 cups instead of 1.5.  Oh and added the parm cheese in the heavy cream. DELISH!!!!!!!  Best recipe I have found online ever!!!

i did this a little different (hence 4 stars), and it was super good....the original might be 5 star!  i used lean turkey and added my own hot spices.  i also used half and half (less than called for) and some sour cream.  lastly, i just mixed it all together with romano and didn't bake, skipping the mozerella.  it was good!  thanks poster for the receipe!

I only had $20 to spend on a New Years dish, and most of the ingredients were basics that I already had in the pantry. Only had to buy mushrooms, sausage, and the cheese + cream. It came out amazing! Really glad I took a chance on this dish people think I'm a good cook now lol!

 I was asked to make it again today so I'm writing this review as thanks. My guests really enjoyed this pasta as did I :D

Wow. Glad we decided to try this recipe. Very Simple weeknight meal. Crazy Good. My husband literally Inhaled his 1st serving and went back for 2 more. While not the most healthy recipe, sometimes, you just want Comfort Food for Supper... I did follow other reviewers suggestions and added an onion, red bell pepper and fresh chopped parsley. Also went a lil generous with the sauce. This recipe has earned a spot in the rotation.

impressive, easy to make. i made with chicken because I am not the biggest fan of Italian Sausage. Of the 3 kids, I had 1 who said was amazing, 1 who said was just ok, and one who said was a little bland. I felt it was good and would make again if more of the kids liked, but probably won't because a lot was wasted

This was very good as written! Thanks for the recipe, Peter!
I made it twice more and the second time added sun-dried tomatoes. Very good!
The last time, I had left-over bbq tri-tip which I used instead of the sausage...man, oh, man!! fantastic!

Great recipe to serve guests.  Served with garlic bread and a salad! I added a bit more heavy cream and parm since we are big fans of sauce.

This was a great recipe. I used sweet and hot sausage and added chicken and asparagus to the recipe. I think the asparagus made it even better. I didn't use the oil because I cooked the sausage first and used the grease to cook the chicken. I also added butter to the veggies when I sauted them. The sauce didn't really thicken up until after it sat out for about 15 minutes. So needless to say seconds were creamier. I would also make more sauce next time or use less penne. This is a keeper dish in our home!!!

Used half sweet and half hot italian sausage. Added 1/2 cup dry marsala w mushrooms and cooked until liquid reduced by about half before adding heavy cream.  Delicious - even better the next day.

I made this with some modifications to make it healthier.  I used high fiber penne pasta instead of regular pasta.  I cooked this with hot Italian sausage with one medium onion cut up  to give it an extra kick.  Once those were cooked I drained the fat, added three cups of fresh spinach and one small container of baby tomatoes sliced.  I reduced the heavy whipping cream to 1/2 cup, added 2 tables of butter,  1 1/4 C of chicken stock and 2 tablespoons of flour.  Very delicious without all of the unwanted fat!

This is a FANTASTIC dish! I made a big change because I am LAZY (and 76 years old). I did a no-bake! I cooked the pasta al dente and set aside. Then I mixed all the other ingredients in a skillet and cooked over med-hi heat into a fragrant sauce. Then I gave everyone a bowl and told them to mix their own stuff. Everyone loved it!!!

Put it over the top - add 1 cup of white wine to your white sauce and then bake...and then and only then you will see that you have entered Heaven

Enjoyed this very much.  It is one of the few dishes my DH said to put on my "A" list.  (Makes me wonder which dishes are on my "b, c, and d" lists.  Hmmmm)  Anyway, I found that the dish was perfect until I baked it, then it seemed to lose some of it's aroma and taste.  Don't know why that would have happened.  But still delicious as is.  Making for a second time this week, but adding a little spinach for color, and will be serving straight from the stovetop, with the addition of some mozzarella.  Thanks for sharing!

I used the basic recipe guide in this but instead of Italian sausage I used apple chicken sausage and added 1 cup of white sweet onion in the sauté along with a pinch of cayanne seasoning and instead of Italian sausage I used chicken apple sausage. It turned out great and was a hit with the family!

Amazing. I added 2 cups of heavy cream instead of 1 1/2 as it seamed dry once I mixed it all together. Yum.

This recipe was amazing!  We used venison sausage and baby bella mushrooms.  Also, make sure you put the parmesan cheese into the sauce as the recipe doesn't state to do so.  It was really easy to put togeher and the whole family loved it (even my picky 7 year old).

This is incredibly delicious, and it is fairly quick and easy. Usually something this good takes hours to make.  I made it tonight,  and didn't make any changes. I guessed the parmesan went in the sauce, and I added it a little before it was done simmering.  I made half a recipe. It should have been enough to feed 4, but the 2 of us couldn't quit eating, and we ate over half of it! I served it with fresh green beans al dente.

Yum! This was delicous! My husband is not a fan of pastas with white sauce but he LOVED this. I added a dash of nutmeg and used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was so tasty. We will definitely make again!

This is a 5 star recipe before my alterations! It can be a main dish or a heavy side dish.  The only thing I did to alter it was add fresh basil at the last and tossed in fresh tomato because that's what I had from my garden that needed to be used.  The only complaint (and I use this word loosely) is that it needs some color--either parsley or basil tossed in right before you throw it in the oven with the cheese.

Excellent! I did make a few changes to use up what I had on hand. We had leftover grilled beef tenderloin so sliced it thin and replaced the sausage with that. Also added a sliced orange pepper to the saute and a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan after the mushrooms. Also had some grated fontina to use up so mixed that in with the parm and then with the mozzarella and sprinkled that on top before broiling. Oh, and also doubled the cream due to the other reviews that mentioned it could be a little dry. This was really enjoyed by all and we will make it again...next time with sausage. Thank you for sharing!

This is an outstanding, and easy, recipe which makes a great dinner. As mentioned by a few others, I added about 1/4 of a thinly sliced red onion along with the garlic. It's amazing how the heavy cream picks up the flavors of everything cooking in it and produces a totally flavorful combination. I used whole wheat penne, which doesn't affect taste but perhaps provides a little more nutrition. Bravo, Bravo!

SO GOOD! The Italian sausage was a bit spicy for our 7yr old, but my husband and I loved it! I used a full 2 cups of the heavy whipping cream, Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese for the sauce as we like our pasta a bit saucy, and it turned out very well.

This was a good recipe. The mushrooms were kind of weird in the dish but I love mushrooms so I didnt mind. I also added soy sauce and warchestershire sauce when cooking the sausage to give it more flavor.

I've made this several times and now decided to skip that last step in the oven. It's good to go without the melted layer on top!

Delicious! After reading reviews, I added a little extra cream -- maybe 1/4 c -- and parmesan, along with a big handful of chopped fresh basil. My family raved. Super easy to make ahead and pop in the oven when you're ready. Will make again.

Used non fat half and half instead of heavy cream. My family didn't care for the Italian sausage in this. Next time, I'll try sliced Polska kielbasa.

I used half & half bc that's what I had on hand and added 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. This was a really good dish. Update: the leftovers were a bit dry. Still good though...

One of my favorites, we don't like mushrooms, so we use 12oz of pasta, if you keep it a pound, add more cream

We also switched up the cheese, do 1 cup of Parmesan and 1/2 cup of mozzarella.

Also we use sweet italian sausage, probably would be very good with peppers

This was really hearty and made great leftovers. I would suggest draining and rinsing the sausage before returning it to the pan though. Between the sausage and the Parmesan it can become greasy.  I topped it with panko added to the cheese mixture and broiled it at the end for a lovely crisp top. My guys are fans!

Fantastic!  I have to say, I almost took the advice of several reviewers and added tomato, but am glad a tried to go for a more savory white sauce option.  (I almost always default to tomato!)  Instead, I added a diced onion and spinach to the garlic and mushrooms; then added salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, oregano, fennel, and a dash of nutmeg.  Only used a cup of cream.  Absolutely wonderful, I'll make this recipe A LOT!  Thanks :)

I used Prego garlic parmesan sauce and hillshire farms turkey sausage and omitted the mushrooms. I added shredded cheese to the mixture as well as on top. Everything else I did the same. DELICIOUS!

I’d put this in the category of Dude Food. It’s a good mix of flavors, but a little on the heavy side. It would be awesome with a steak.

Hearty, tasty meal. I made according to directions, except I used bowtie pasta. Not as flavorful as I'm accustomed to, but that's an easy fix the second time around. I may have reduced the cream sauce too long, because the casserole baked up a little on the dry side. Served with Greek salad, roasted asparagus, and Italian bread. My kids enjoyed it!

My husband thought this was fantastic. I made a few modifications to make it a little healthier. I used whole wheat penne. I cooked the 16 oz box the recipe called for but when I started to add the other ingredients to the pasta it looked like there was just too much pasta for the amount of sauce. I only used about 3/4 of the pasta. I didn't use any additional olive oil as called for in the recipe. I browned the sausage with no extra oil. I used the grease from the sausage to cook the mushrooms and garlic without adding extra oil. I also added a cup or so of chopped fresh spinach to the mixture. This was really good. I will definitely make it again .

I made this recipe tonight for dinner.  I used rotini instead of penne since that's what I had, but otherwise I followed the instructions.  It turned out really well!  My husband loved it and even had seconds.  If I were to make it again, I might add a chopped sweet onion, cooked with the Italian sausage.  This dish reminded me of a quick stroganoff in a way, which is perfectly fine with me.  I would recommend this recipe to others.

Excellent!  Don't usually do reviews (this is first one) - very easy & delicious.  Made it pretty much like the recipe.  Added some Italian seasoning to the mushroom/garlic mix, and some Italian blend cheese and extra Parmesan to the mozzarella on top, other than that no changes.  Will definitely make again

The earthy flavor of the cremini mushrooms really stands out in this dish. I used rotini instead of penne (personal preference). I cut back the amount of pasta a bit and increased the cream to almost 2 cups. Was concerned it might be too dry otherwise. Like another reviewer I didn't use oil to cook the sausage, just for the mushrooms and garlic. I don't have a broiler proof baking dish so I baked it at 375 degrees for 25 minutes until bubbly. Hubby says it's a keeper.

Awesome dish and kids loved it also. I will most definitely make this again. I love tomatoes so I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes chopped to the top layer before cheese. So glad I did, it made the dish. Next time I'm gonna add a can into the mix and a second can on top. This is important for leftovers in helping the dish stay moist.

This recipe was so good. My family loved it and I will be making this again. However I would love to try it with either grilled chicken or spicy. Thank you so much!

The only changes I made was  to add half an onion and three green onions with the mushrooms. That wouldn't have changed very much, though-I was just trying to use up what we had before it spoiled. This was a delicious recipe! My husband picked it out and it was perfect! I will definitely make this for my family again. It was very easy to make as well, and it was ready quickly-in about 30 minutes. Most recipes end up taking longer for whatever reason, but not this one. A beginner cook will be able to make this successfully.

I made this over the weekend and everyone loved it. I didn't change anything. I made it as is. My husband who usually is not a fan of 'white sauce' loved it! It's so easy to make.

My wife and I loved this dish. Very easy to make. Next time I would not set aside the drippings from the sausage. just a tad too oily. Other than that, it is five stars.

This was a wonderfully easy and very tasty dish.  Made it exactly as written, except added a bit more mozzarella on top because, well, our family loves cheese :-)  Hubby, son-in-law, and 3 grandsons scarfed it down - no leftovers.  Requests to make it again guarantee it will become part of the family favorites rotation.  Thank you, Peter!

This was good, but it seemed to have way too much pasta for the amount of sauce.  My husband is not a big casserole fan,  but said this was one that he actually liked.  There was a ton of cheese, almost to the point of too much, especially from a calorie perspective.  I think next time I will cut down the pasta by about a third and also reduce the cheese.  I think I may also like to try with ground sausage without the Italian seasoning.

Pretty good, very easy. I added more sausage. Also thought the sauce was a bit bland, so o added garlic and onion powder. I also added fresh basil and chopped spinach the last few minutes to wilt in the sauce. Gave it much more flavor. Will make again!

Fast and easy recipe!  My family loved it.  Used light cream instead of heavy cream,  and portabella mushrooms. Doubled the mushrooms.  Will become a staple at holiday time.

This was out of this world yummy!!!! I followed it exactly the first time but there's actually no need to dirty another dish just to broil the cheese on top in the oven. I just threw it all back in my big pot I boiled my pasta water in, and stirred it. It all melts together lovely! We topped with more cheese on each portion! It's so flavorful!

I made this recipe as written. My husband commented (more than once) that it not only smelled "really good", but it tasted great! I thought it was pretty good, but not "out of this world." My sauce really didn't thicken, and that might have just been because I was in a rush to get dinner on the table. It was even better, though, as leftovers the next day. Let's just say that a 9 x 13 dish of this didn't last longer than 2 days in my house of 2 adults and one toddler.

I added onions to the mushrooms while they were cooking. I also added spinach to the final step before mixing with the pasta. 
I also added parsley and basil to the seasonings. 

Would probably also be good if red pepper flakes were added too.

This was a very easy recipe to make and very delicious. I particularly liked the choice of the cremini mushrooms. They are hearty and very flavorful. I did add a few more cloves of garlic because my boyfriend likes it. The recipe was a huge hit!

Good basis for a meal but I drained the grease and sauté onions,zucchini, garlic added fresh peeled tomatoes and a splash of white wine and fresh basil. Tasted great and good for lunch leftovers to reheat at work the next day. Green salad and a slice of fresh french bread made it a yummy meal.

This  was really good!  I didn't have any heavy cream, so had to substitute coconut milk and cream cheese instead, and it turned out great!

Delicious! Not a lot of cleaning to do or cutting of vegetables! Used veggie noodles. My husband also enjoyed it and referred to it as baked ziti.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! My only edits were I added spinach & onions as another reviewers did...and I might thicken the sauce separately in another pan bcuz it was still too thin when combined with veggies & meat. But all in all....FABIOULOSO & a keeper recipe!!

This one's a keeper. Husband loved it. Made mostly as stated, except didn't have a lot of parmesan left, so went heavy on the mozzarella and added a bit of sour cream.  Also, I like a lot of sauce,  so used 2 cups cream. And added a bit of dried basil & parsley, plus some chopped orange bell pepper and sweet onion to the mushrooms. It's worth adding that this recipe would probably have been good without those changes, since it's hard to pick a recipe from this app when people assign 5 stars and then change nearly everything.

I made this dish with what I had on hand. I had the sausage and pasta, and olive oil. I used fresh mushrooms and added a bell pepper (chopped) and and onion (diced) when I sauteed the garlic and mushrooms. I did not set aside the sausage, just added all of the vegetables directly to the skillet. I added about a third cup of milk, as I had no heavy whipping cream. I don't care if it's saucy, so this worked out well for me, just to keep it moist. I had an italian six cheese mix to top it with and it turned out delicious. I did not see the temperature for the oven, so I just baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes.  Oh and I also added a diced jalapeno in the vegetable phase.

1.31.15 Sadly disappointed.  Maybe it's "guy food" & I'm a girl.  I would've - should've - added some wine & more vegetables.  'Been making magic few-ingredient-but-amazing-taste recipes lately & hoped this I could add to the collection.  Nope.  'Just have to dress up the leftovers. 3.10.15 'Thawed this to make into a breakfast casserole & it's being eaten.  :?  For me, too much sausage; but it went down the teen boy.  :o  :)

This dish is so tasty. Because I'm on Weight Watchers I used light cream instead of heavy and used whole grain Penne instead of regular.  Never would know the difference.  I had a red pepper in fridge that needed to be used and sliced that putting it in with the Portobello ' s when I stir fried. Delish! This one is a keeper and a good dish to take to pot luck or dinner party.

I am eating leftovers of this dish while I write this review.  I didn't have as many mushrooms as the recipe called for, so I supplemented with onion and yellow pepper.  Yes, it is higher in fat than what I typically like to eat, and yes, the recipe doesn't tell you what to do with the Parmesan cheese (I just left it out).  However, this was still great!  I will definitely make this again!

My family and I loved this recipe.  We only used about 2/3 of the penne to make sure we had plenty of sauce, and it was perfect.  The recipe doesn't state when to add the parmesan cheese, so I added it to the sauce before I added the pasta and it was great!  Definitely a keeper.

Great!! Used half and half since that was what I had and added some sour cream. Thickened it up with flour and ended up wishing I hadn't - won't do that next time, it was too thick. Also sauted an onion with the mushrooms, great addition. Used Montery Jack cheese since I was all out of mozzarella and wished I hadn't - too strong. I'll probably just leave it out next time, the flavor is awesome and doesn't even need any extra cheese. Already looking forward to leftovers!

My husband made this and it was so good! The only change next time will be to add some red pepper or use a spicier italian sausage. I loved it and the left overs tasted even better. My friends were over for left overs and asked for the recipe. We will def have this again....well worth the calories :)

Amazing!!!  I did not use the sausage, as I didn't have any.  But I will try it w/sausage next time! I was also out of heavy cream, so I subbed a milk/butter mixture with a bit of flour to thicken it.   This is SO easy to make and is sooooo tasty.  I was amazed that I'm actually capable of making a creamy sauce that doesn't separate :)  I put it over whole wheat spaghetti and sauteed chicken.  My husband, father, and even my toddler gobbled it up!

This was pretty good. Definitely flavorful, but a little dry for my taste. But it could be my fault because I think I went overboard on the cheese. Very tasty though!
