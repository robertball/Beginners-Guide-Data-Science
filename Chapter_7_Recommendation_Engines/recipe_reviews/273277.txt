This was absolutely delicious!!! I didn't change a thing except I drained the corn but that is because I wasn't paying attention. The whole family loved. Thank you for the recipe :)

This was really delicious and soooo easy. It is very rich so I would recommend using 1/2 fat cream cheese. I didn't have cannelini beans so I substituted pinto beans instead and it worked out just fine. I didn't have Rotel so I put in a jar of mild salsa and it worked out just fine as well. Used cream style corn instead and again, it worked out just fine. Also, I didn't have a packet of ranch dressing mix so I used about 1/2 a cup or more of ranch dressing already made. The soup tasted great.

Very good!  I added some baby portabella mushrooms and a little chicken broth.  Cream cheese gives it a great added flavor.  Will make again.

I loved the simplicity, I didn't bother with the corn, a personal preference. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

It has a nice bite to it, but that might be due to my accidentally  spilling a little extra cumin into the mix. Oh well. :)

I will make this again

Itâ€™s a good soup and we enjoyed the creaminess, but I would not call it a chili. Still on the hunt for a good chicken chili!

So good! I had a tub of jalapeno cream cheese so I dumped that in too. I doubled it and am soo glad I did, my kids actually ate the leftovers all week.

I made this for a church family that is gluten free. They loved it so I made a second batch. When I took the chicken breasts out to shred, I took a whisk to blend the cream cheese more evenly otherwise is was kind of lumpy I

This is just souped up Fiesta Chicken with a few extra ingredients, so it has to be good.

This is a staple at my house, especially in the cooler months.  This is my stand by when I want to make and take a meal to someone who's sick or just needs some extra help.  So easy and SO GOOD!
