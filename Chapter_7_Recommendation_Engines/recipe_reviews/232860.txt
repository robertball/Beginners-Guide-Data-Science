My boys really enjoyed this one. I only baked the steak for 30 minutes and then poured the leftover sauce into a small sauce pan and reduced it to more of a syrup consistency. Then, I poured it back over the steak. I didn't do that the first time I made this dish and have to say that it was much better with the syrup.

This was the first time I made a ham steak for my hubby and I. This was a super easy recipe and super easy to make. The glaze was delicious, I thickened it with a little some corn starch. I served the ham steak with mashed potatoes and corn and pineapple slices for the ham. It was soooo good. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious and FAST!  Rather than bake in the oven, I glazed the ham steak and then pan seared it on the stove for about 2 minutes per side.  The glaze began to caramelize by the time the ham was lightly browned, and it was really good dripped over the finished steak.  Everybody loved it, especially with some fresh pineapple on the side.

ohhh wow, wow, wow!! sooo yummy and easy! and it came out amazing even though I kinda screwed it up...its like 900 degrees in my air conditioning-less kitchen, so I decided to try making these in the skillet, which was fine. I only ran into trouble making the sauce in a pan- first I couldn't get it to thicken up to a glaze, so like a dummy I tried a little cornstarch. it still wouldn't thicken AND I couldn't get rid of the cornstarch taste, which usually cooks out in a few minutes. so I got frustrated and just let it cool for a bit, and THEN it turned into a sticky, gooey mess...Argg! its funny bc this is so simple, and my kids call me "the sauce queen" (I'm known for my delicious sauces, Lol) but I probably would have ended up being out of the kitchen much faster if I just stuck it in the oven per the original recipe! in the end, I just stirred some butter into the sauce and hoped for the best...and it turned out so good anyway that the fam was fighting over the last one! which is great, especially bc I got 4 ham steaks for $5, and bc my DH told me when we first started dating that he "hates" pork, and ham in particular... thanx to this recipe, he's actually asking for it! thanx so much for sharing, this is definitely going into the rotation.

Cooking for two, I used one ham steak, quartered the recipe, and reduced cooking time by 10 minutes. Also used a sprinkling of ground cloves and a small handful of raisins. BEST HAM EVER!!

The glaze was great.  I used one large ham steak (the kind that Costco sells in packs of 3) and I cut the recipe for the glaze in half.  It was plenty.

I made the sauce according to the recipe except I omitted the cloves. I grilled the ham a couple of minutes on each side. When I turned it over I topped the ham with some sauce. I also grilled pineapple rings for each serving. 
I served the ham cut into individual servings, topped with the pineapple and additional sauce on the side. A real keeper.

As  I was short on time, I made this sauce in a pan while I warmed the steaks. I left out the vinegar, as my family does not like it, and used a honey Dijon mustard. I brushed the steaks with the sauce once they were warmed, and let them cook just a little longer. Served with the sauce poured on top. 
This was very yummy, and I will try again following the recipe next time! Thanks for a great recipe!

A very good and fast dish for a weeknight dinner. Bought one big ham steak so halved the recipe and with mashed potatoes and mixed frozen veggies it was more than enough for the two of us. Will make again!

I  too reduced the sauce in half and it was yummy.  How are you suppose to know when the ham is brown with all the sauce on it?

This was delicious and easy. I didn't have any whole cloves so used a few sprinkles of ground cloves instead.

I can't say I followed this recipe exactly, though I'm sure it is delish! Okay, so I didn't have any maple syrup or whole cloves, but I had Apple butter syrup and ground cloves. I used a teaspoon of ground cloves and the same amount of syrup. I also used cider vinegar instead of  white vinegar. 
This was sooooo yummy, I had to share it.

Hubby & I really liked this glaze.  Added just the right amount of "zing" to an otherwise pretty boring ham steak.  This one's a keeper!

Delicious - we loved it! My ham slices were about 9"x8" and  little less than 1/2" thick. I followed the recipe exactly, but half as much syrup ingredients, which was plenty. Could be because the ham slices used for the original recipe were larger than mine.
