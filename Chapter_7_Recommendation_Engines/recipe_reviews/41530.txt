This is wonderful!  A new way to eat bland old cauliflower.  I had reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and next time will reduce all the way to 1/3 cup.  I measured out 2 cups of cauliflower, but next time I'll just throw an entire head in.  There would still be plenty of marinade.  Will definitely make again.

I was entertaining Atkins dieters and needed low carb recipes.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1/3 cup olive oil.  Also substituted sugar with Splenda.  My guests LOVED this - very colorful and tasty!  Will definitely use it for the holidays as well.

This recipe is definitely one I'll use again and again.  It tastes just like something the deli would have only fresher because you made it.  My family loved it!
