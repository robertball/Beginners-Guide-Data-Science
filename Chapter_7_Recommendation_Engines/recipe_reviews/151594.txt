This is the easiest recipe ever and the results are delicious! Here are my changes and substitutions: I didn't have any parsley, so I substituted French thyme. I also experimented with different toppings once the twists were on the cookie sheet and glazed with egg white. I sprinkled some with sesame seeds, some with poppy seeds and some with garlic salt. And some with a combination. Our favorite was with the sesame seeds with a pinch of garlic salt.

I also experimented with the size of the twists, and truthfully, all were delightful! Perhaps the largest ones were a tad doughy, but still quite good.

One extra note - we didn't care for these once they cooled off, they became somewhat flaccid. But a quick pop into the toaster oven (less than one cycle through on medium "toast") made them even crunchier and we actually preferred them reheated.

Next time I make these, I will make them an hour or so before my guests arrive and then re-toast them before serving. That should buy me some time to make the main course.

Thanks for posting this recipe - it's a winner!

Very good. I made one batch as the recipe stated. For the second batch instead of using the cheese, I used cinnamon and sugar. Did everything else the same. Wow, great either way.

We LOVE these!!! I didn't know that this recipe was on AR (I first tried them after reading the little recipe card that came in the puff pastry box.) So, I was glad to see it here so I could review them...really - try these (and make no changes!)

This recipe saved me! I needed something quick and yummy for a Christmas party.  I had puff pastry on hand and all the other ingredients.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the cheese mixture simply because I love garlic.  They were a hit with my family...especially all the little ones.  Wonderful!

These were very good. My husband and kids loved them.  I used garlic powder, salt and pepper instead of the herbs, which still gave good flavor.

Pretty, delicious, light and flaky.  I liked the addition of the oregano, which adds great flavor, although any number of herbs or spices would be very good.  I also added garlic powder, which seemed a natural for this.

Loved it! I modified recipe a little- added 1/8 cup of shredded cheddar and mozarella mix plus fresh herbs I had left from Thanksgiving, rosemary and thyme, garlic powder. The result is delicious. Going to make them for Christmas as an appetizer.

This was my first experience with puff pastry. These were delicious and very simple to make. I made them ahead and froze them as suggested. I did have to extend the baking time a bit, but just watched until they were golden brown. Thanks for a new keeper!

These were delicious when made fresh, but not as good when made from frozen.  I used dried parsley.

I made this recipe a while ago and found them to be a bit bland. The second time I made them, I added a bit of salt and pepper before adding the 2nd half of the dough on top of the other half. One thing I would like to point out is that in the recipe it calls for grated parmesan cheese, but in the video it shows that the cheese is shaved. The shaved pieces would make it a bit difficult when twisting the dough, therefore, it would be better to used grated cheese instead. I also found that the thinner the strips are sliced, the crisper the twists turn out. I have made these with prosciutto and gruyere, mortatella and mozzarella, and as described in the recipe. The possibilities are endless. I make them often when we have guests or when my kids need an afternoon snack. It's always well received by adults as well as children. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My whole family loved these!  I am thinking of experimenting with different types of cheeses (ie. cheddar) next time we make them- although parmesan was delicious.  Thanks for a fun and festive recipe.

So buttery and crisp and cheesy.  I used a mix of smoked gouda and parmesan and they were delicious.

Sort of time-consuming and the puff pastry turned out a little difficult to work with. Overall not too bad though.

I made this to go along with Grilled New York Strip steak and a Caesar salad.  My only addition was some garlic powder.  I love the flakiness of the puff pastry!

A fun and interesting 'twist' for my bunco buffet! Changes: I did not cut the dough prior to brushing , I sprinkled with Parmesan  but used Salad Supreme for seasoning (an Italian flavored sprinkle). I then folded the dough in half long wise , folded it again and then cut the strips with kitchen scissors! It's simple to undo one of the folds after cutting and then just twist. I sprinkled them again on the non-stick foil covered tray and baked until golden.  I will continue to experiment with the herbs & spices...Very nice!
