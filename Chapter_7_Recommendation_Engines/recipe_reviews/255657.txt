I hate when people judge other people’s creations when obviously if they had a better recipe for it they  wouldn’t need to use someone else’s. I liked this recipe. Even with having to leave out a few ingredients, it was good. Good job ddmama!

The chowder was a good throw-it-in-the-pot, relatively quick and easy meal, but nothing to write home about. It allowed me to use up some extra kale I had in the fridge, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to make it again,
