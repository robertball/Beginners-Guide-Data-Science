I followed the recipe exact, only using dried cranberries instead of raisins and I omitted the cocoa powder. I don't keep parchment paper on hand, I just sprayed my pan with a little non-stick cooking spray. Before pressing them into a baking pan, I did coat my hands with non-stick cooking spray just to make it a little easier. The baking time was spot on for me.  These turned out exactly as I hoped they would. I did not try them myself but the kids thought they were "yummy".

I used only whole wheat flour, and changed the applesauce to pumpkin puree.  Wonderful taste!

Followed the recipe exactly without using the cocoa. I found them to be outstanding in flavor however rubbery in texture. I would rate them a 3 1/2 if I could.

I made these using my mom's homemade canned applesauce.  Nice fiber blast, I would make these again, but add more raisins.  Also, I don't care for wheat flour, so I just used all purpose.

3 out of 4 in my family really weren't fans. They were a bit soft/chewy. That I could deal with but the flavor combination just didn't work well for us. They were fun to make but they were just not 5 star for my family. Sorry!

A bit too rubbery in texture, as another reviewer mentioned. The taste wasn't quite as strong as promised. I'd like to try them again and add some more grains...maybe some flax seeds and sunflower seeds...and increase the amount of spices.

Easy to make but the taste is not good. They are rubbery and do not taste good at all.

I made these sugar free - edamame instead of raisins, splenda instead of brown sugar, sugar-free maple syrup instead of honey, sugar-free applesauce.   Other than that, I made as written and it turned out fine.
