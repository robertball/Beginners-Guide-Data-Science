I really wanted to love these but I didn't. The dough was a decent texture but it really had almost no flavor to me. Was just dough topped with cinnamon sugar. The dough itself needs some flavor. like cinnamon or nutmeg.. chocolate chips.. something. Ill try these again with some tweaks

This is a great recipe for non-bakers. I specifically chose it because it was simple and didn't require a ton of prep time. The dough came together well and the pretzels were great I did season the dough with cinnamon salt allspice and tumeric based on another review. I also used powered sugar rather than regular sugar to turn the topping into more of a glaze. I'll definitely make these again.

It was pretty good. I feel like I wanted a lot of ingredients on this I could have used 1/5th of the amount of cinnamon sugar and butter for the top coat. And putting the cinnamon sugar on before the top coat didn't stick. If I am to make it again I would mix the cinnamon sugar into the dough to sweeten the bread as it is quite flavorless and didn't get the taste I was going for. All in all not bad. I've never made anything like this before so I think I did ok

I was hoping these would turn out good but the dough just didnt have a good taste to it. It was so plain. I didnt like it. No matter how much coating of sugar i added to try to give it flavor it just didnt work.
