This dip is excellent! I thought it was too salty (and I'm a total salt lover!) so the next time I make it I will probably scale the salt back from 1 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. Other than that excellent excellent black bean dip. Way better than anything you can buy at the market.

Simple. Easy. And delicious. I didn't have any jalapenos but did saute some red pepper along with the onion. This is a great snack with tortilla chips.

This beats any store bought dip by a mile. left out jalape√±o and used catsup as substitute for paste. Easy to make!
