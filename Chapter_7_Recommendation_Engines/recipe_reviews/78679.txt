We loved this ! It gets high marks for simple, fresh taste - doesn't cover the flavor of the salmon - and it's a breeze to prepare. I added a little Orange juice to the mayo and tarragon and mixed it up before I spread it onto the fish. I served fresh asparagus sauted in butter and some crusty dinner rolls. NO LEFT OVERS !  Thanks so much !

I have made this many times to rave reviews.  Easy, looks lovely on the plate.  I mixed in a Tbsp or so of orange juice to the mayo mixture.  Also used a pinch of dried tarragon as I did not have fresh, worked out fine.  Think I might try crushed macadamia nuts next time.  This one is a KEEPER!

Loved it!  I used regular mayo and mixed in some dijon mustard. My husband thought this was the best salmon recipe we've ever had!

I followed your basic recipe EXCEPT I added a couple teaspoons of honey Dijon mustard to regular mayo (as suggested by another reviewer) and used almonds, dill & lemon zest instead of hazelnuts, tarragon & orange zest. I also added a light sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese to the salmon 5 minutes before the fish was done. Served with lemon wedges. YUM!

Awesome! My boyfriend ate the entire thing in 3 min he loved it so much. I made a few changes, I used half the amount of recommended mayo (i used regular mayo not fat free), and doubled the orange zest, which I added straight to the mayo. I also squeezed a little juice from the orange into the mayo, then spread it onto the fish. I used macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts because I couldn't find any hazelnuts in my grocery store, and I didn't add any salt since the macadamia nuts already had salt on them. It came out delicious! Will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe several times and it is a winner! Like several of the previous reviewers, I used low fat mayo, a little juice from the orange and dijon mustard. I mixed all my ingredients together and top the salmon. The salmon is VERY moist and always gets rave reviews. I love cooking, and this recipe is so easy it's almost embarassing!!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now and can't find one to top it!  Every time I make it, everyone raves about it.  You can also use almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc...  I usually serve it with the Lemon Dill Rice recipe on this site and steamed carrots.  Absolutely wonderful!

I wasn't as into this as my husband was, but I'm not a huge salmon fan to begin with. I followed the original recipe except: 2 tsp fresh tarragon was replaced with 2 tsp dried tarragon; orange zest was replaced with rehydrated orange peel from penzey's; and i forgot the salt/pepper. added the salt after it came out -- no need for pepper! it looked very pretty. next time i'll try almonds. might enjoy that better.

This was awesome. Looks and tastes reallllly good. I didn't really follow the exact measurements for ingredients because I think you can totally eyeball how much mayo to spread, and how much salt/hazelnuts/pepper to sprinkle. I did not have any tarragon on hand so I sprinkled a few rosemary leaves in the middle of each salmon piece. I also didn't use any orange zest. The timing for the baking was perfect. The salmon was moist and flaked with the touch of the fork, perfectly. =) yummm. Oh, and I served each salmon piece on top of a bed of spring salad on each plate.

I am not a "fish" person, but am trying to intoduce this healthy food to my family.  I recently purchased tarragon for another recipe and loved the flavor and did an ingredient search and this recipe popped up (I substituted dried tarragon for the fresh).  I have a hard time rating this, as I have to force myself to eat fish, but my husband gives it a 4....and my 2 year old ate it (it is a rarity that he ever eats dinner)!  Perhaps if you are a salmon lover this just might be a 5.  I personally liked the combo of flavors on top of the fish, and it does have a really nice presentation.....and probably one of the quickest meals I have ever prepared.  I think I may try this flavor combo on top of a less fishy fish such as talapia!  Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe.

This was just amazing. Salmon is my favourite seafood and I eat it often.  This was easy to make (which is partly why I tried it) and left me wanting more. Soooo good.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  My husband, two grown sons, and I all enjoyed quite a bit.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of salmon, and only 1/2 c. of fat free mayonaise, and that was plenty, maybe a little too much.  Next time I do this I am going to chop the hazelnuts finer--I thank that would make for a better texture.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice flavor, but in my opinion, didn't need the salt.  Also, I had to extend the baking time for the thick fillets I used.  I will make this again

Really loved this recipe!  The fresh orange taste and crunch of nuts (I used macadamia nuts) was excellent!  I also squeezed the juice of one wedge of a fresh orange into the mayo and i was able to use less of it and still esaily spread a thin layer over the salmon.  I will definitely make this again.  I loved how easy it was too!

The combination of orange zest and nuts gave the salmon a unique flavour. Was delicious and served to guests who enjoyed it. Simple and basic, yet flavourful.

I really tried to give this a 5 star, but the site wasn't working right. This was great.  I too added dijon mustard to the mayo.  Very moist, not fishy tasting.

Good recipe but needs a little work.  I only put about a tablespoon of mayonnaise onto each fillet and also added some orange zest right into the mayo to add a little more flavor.  Great overall flavor.

Fantastic! I substituted pecans for the hazelnuts because that's what I had available, but can't wait to try it again with the hazelnuts.

I'm sorry, but my husband and I really did not care for this.  It tasted like what it is, salmon with mayonnaise on top, which is not very appetizing.  We scraped off the topping and at the fish plain, and I'm giving it two stars instead of one because 15 minutes at 400 degrees made for moist, delicious salmon.

Kind of gross... Maybe I needed to chop the hazelnuts even smaller? Either way, we scraped the topping off to eat the salmon plain.

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious, it deserves 5 stars! I'm a beginner when it come's to cooking and this recipe was incredibly easy. I had to play around with this recipe, since I lacked some ingredients, I used 1/2 cup low fat yogurt, 1tbsp of lemon juice, 2 tbsp of orange juice, 1/4 tsp of mustard, and some salt to replace the mayonnaise and it turned out wonderfully, my parents said it tasted just like mayonnaise and my mom was pleased with the low calories. I also added some Parmesan cheese and almonds on top. Will definitely make again, and may be next time I'll place the sauce on top of some baked mussels, yummm!

Very good!  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts because I had them on hand.  Though I love all seafood, my husband is a salmon tolerator, not a liker.  This was the first time I made salmon where my husband had something to say.  His comment mirrored my own.  Thanks for sharing

Wowza! This was amazing! I made it for a dinner party and it was a hit! I had 3 big pieces of Salmon so I doubled the topping recipe. I also used regular mayo and added some fresh oj and minced shallots to the mayonnaise mixture. I will make this again!!

Very easy, different and very good. I used dried tarragon, which was fine and a mixture of hazelnuts and almonds and low fat mayo. I almost forgot the orange zest but I'm glad I remembered.  It added a complexity that no one could quite pinpoint. Because I used wild salmon,  the fillets were thinner, so I only cooked it 10 min.  It's a keeper.

I substituted the hazelnuts for hulled hemp seed nuts and it was delicious!  Make sure not to overcook.
