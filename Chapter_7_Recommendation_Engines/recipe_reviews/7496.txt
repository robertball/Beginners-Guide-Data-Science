After modifying this recipe in the following ways, this was BY FAR, one of the most awesome homemade frostings I have ever made or tasted!  AMAZING on chocolate cake (or cupcakes, as I made).  The recipe I used was as follows:  1 cup creamy NON-GENERIC peanut butter (the peanut butter taste will only be as good as the type of peanut butter you use-- I used Jiff and it was awesome), 1 stick BUTTER (not margarine), 2 cups confectioners sugar (NOT 4!) and 2-3 Tbsp cream OR milk.  I creamed the first two ingredients together, added the sugar and then added the cream at the end and just whipped away in my electric mixer.  For those of you who hated this recipe and said it was too greasy and not spreadable, you probably either used crappy peanut butter or used margarine which is more oily than butter OR you didn't mix the butter (at room temp) and peanut butter (also at room temp) enough before adding the sugar... use the recipe I just wrote above, and you simply can't go wrong... it was absolutely TO DIE FOR on my chocolate cupcakes and everyone at work LOVED them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and added 1/2 cup more peanut butter.  This was good, fluffy frosting. It had just the right peanut butter flavor. Quick and easy.

This is an excellent recipe as it is, but I found that by adding a tsp. of vanilla, it gave it a more pronounced peanut butter flavor.

This was amazing.  I follwed the advice of others and adjusted the recipe for sweetness and over butteriness.  Here's what I came up with: 1 and 1/4 cup peanut butter (room temp), 1 stick butter (at room temp), 1 and 1/3 cup confectioners sugar (added slowly and mixing after each time) 4 Tbs cream.  What I did was after creaming together the PB and butter and slowly added the sugar 1/3 cup at a time with 1 Tbs cream.  after I mixed it I tasted it and repeated.  It tasted best to me at 1 and 1 1/3 cup sugar.  I added more PB (the extra 1/4 cup) about half way through to make it more peanut buttery.  It's VERY rich.  I used it as the filling for a chocolate cake, then frosted with chocolate and sprinkled the new PB and chocolate swirled chips.  It was a big hit.

Ok, with modifications this is 5 stars but the original recipe is probably only worth 3!  So 4 for a compromise.  IF you use 2 cups confectioner's sugar and 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, you'll get a very peanut butter flavored icing; 2 cups sugar with 1 cup pb would make a milder one, though I like my peanut butter!  It was delicious on a Mahogany Sour Cream Cake from http://web.kraftfoods.com/.  It worked fine on the sides of my cake.

I have been on the hunt for the perfect peanut butter frosting, and from reading the reviews for this, I thought I had found it.  However, my search will continue.  I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  I needed to add MUCH more milk (I had no cream in the house) than the recipe called for.  After the first cup, I added 1/3 cup as stated, but after every half cup, I needed to add a healthy splash of milk to make the frosting spreadable.  I used two and a half cups, and found that it did make enough to frost my two layer cake, with some left over, however, I didn't like the taste at all.  Too much butter, not enough peanut butter, perhaps milk should not be substituted for the cream?  I'm not sure, but like I said, the search will continue.

I thought this was very good.  I made it according to the recipe. (Please don't mark recipes down when you make a bunch of changes in its preparation.)  I thought it did taste like peanut butter cup filling, although maybe not as strongly flavored of peanut butter as those are.  I used my frosting over a layer of chocolate ganache over a chocolate cake.  People really seemed to like it.  This frosting does tint well if you use a lot of paste coloring and stick to primary colors.

Very rich and creamy. Used milk instead of cream and only needed 3 cups of powdered sugar. I spread it on Dark Chocolate Cake II from this site, chilled it,and then drizzled Satiny Chocolate Glaze, also from this site, over the cake. Delicious.

Wow, this was one of the most disappointing recipes that I have ever tried from this site. I really struggled not to rate it lower. I ended up having to doctor this up a ton to get it to an edible status. I added some regular, granulated sugar and vanilla and I had to add a ton more cream. I did bring the butter to room temperature and used a fresh jar of Peter Pan peanut butter. Thanks anyway.

Like the rest of the gang I also cut back on the sugar and added more peanut butter. I also used cream cheese in lieu of the cream. I made cupcakes which, once cooled and using my electric cookie press, I filled each cupcake with jelly and then topped them with this absolutely delicious frosting. YUM!!!! Thanks Suzanne!

I thought this recipe was great. I doubled it but still only added the 4 cups of sugar. I put it on the first layter of a chocolate cake and added some chocolate frosting to the rest and topped the peanut butter second layer of my cake. It turned out delicious and was a hit.

There seems to be two popular peanut butter frosting recipes on this site - this one, and "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting."  After reading many of the reviews of this recipe it quickly became apparent that most of the reviewers were reducing the amount of powdered sugar by half.  I'm so glad I followed the recipe as written because in my case I found that not only was there not too much powdered sugar, to my liking there wasn't enough!  Even as written, using the four cups of powdered sugar, this was just greasy and grainy looking, not creamy and fluffy at all - almost like a soft version of the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup!  And I did beat it long enough that if it was going to become fluffy, it would have. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I found I had to add considerably more sugar (didn't measure) to not only make it fluffy, creamy and pretty, but to simply make it palatable.

This is amazing! If you love Peanut Butter like I do, this one is for you!!!
I did make adjustments as most here do. Here's what worked for me:
1 stick Butter, softened (Do NOT use margarine, makes it oily)
1 Cup Peanut Butter
2 Cups Confectioners Sugar
2-3 Tbsp Milk
Cream butter in mixer, add Peanut Butter, mix well, add confectioners sugar, add the milk/cream as needed, but only 1 Tbsp at a time.
I put this on my triple chocolate cupcakes topped with mini peanut butter cups. They were sinful!

For me, I cut the sugar way back (according to the previous reviewer's suggestions) and I added in the milk as needed so I could get it to the consistancy I wanted. I frosted devil's food cupcakes with this frosting. The boys really liked it.

After a friend made chocolate and pb frosting cupcakes, I had to search for the recipe for the icing...  This one worked awesome, however I followed someone else's suggestion and only used 2c of powdered sugar.  I also added a few drops of vanilla.  This was JUST LIKE Reece's cups filling.  I couldn't stop eating it with a spoon.  There was plenty for 24 cupcakes...  I also cut mini reese's cups in half and put each half on top of the cupcake...  Mmmmm!

It seems like a lot of people had to do a lot of modifying to this recipe to make it work correctly, me included...so for that I am giving it one star and not five like everyone else.

After following the exact proportions of everything, it was WAY too thick for frosting. I ended up adding another 1/4 or so of cream. Not enough, so I ended up adding a while additional stick of butter to make it nice and fluffy. It was perfect after that. 

If I use the recipe again, I will probably try using this only 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 and seeing how that goes. Or just doing it exactly how I did.

if you like peanut butter, this is the one for you. made it with an "oily" peanut butter, and it turned out fine, a better quality PB would result in a better product. It did need a bit more cream + splash of milk,. Will make it again.

these are the proportions we like!  2 Cups of 10x leaves this with an unappetizing taste and texture.  Perfect exactly as written!  Buttercream frosting has 4 cups so why is this too sweet?

This is AMAZING! I used less sugar than the four cups but more than the 2 cups suggested by other reviewers; I'm not sure exactly how much since I wasn't really measuring, just going by taste. Same for the cream, I think I used about 1/4 cup total. When I thought the frosting was about ready, I added another little bit of sugar, a little more splash of cream and a bit of vanilla extract, and let it whip for a couple of minutes. Then I tasted it and almost didn't want to frost the cake, I could have eaten the whole batch right out of the bowl! It was nice and fluffy, so tasty but not too sweet... just out of this world good. I'd never made a peanut butter frosting before but I sure will again!

This frosting is far too thick to decorate anything with. I ended up having to double the amount of cream it asked for, and it still had the consistency of wet concrete. It tasted pretty delicious, but if you enjoy piping or making little flowers and stuff with your frosting, this is not the frosting for you.

A really great peanut butter frosting.  I used it to frost  chocolate muffins.  This would be a perfect filling for oatmeal sandwich cookies!

Think recipe is DELISH!!!! I own a bakery and will definitely be showcasing this in my bakery :) The only thing I did differently was added 1 teaspoon vanilla after creaming the butter and pb together... also - I use good pb (Jif) and just regular milk... super super good!!! One of my favs now!!!

I halved the sugar and used butter.  The frosting on its own was very sweet but when put on chocolate cupcakes it was just right.
I used Smuckers natural PB and didn't have any issues with greasiness.

I did not alter this recipe in any way, and it magnificently coated my chocolate cake! I am making it again tonight and am thinking I might make it more creamy, but the flavor was perfect! I made my son his 1st Birthday cake, a Winnie the Pooh cake - it was just the brown for Winnie!

Really good. I used it to ice the chocolate cake I made. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups. Anymore would have been too sweet.

I took the notations from the first reviewer and I just happened to have my last 2 cups of c.sugar and 3TBS of cream left. I agree about others' points on butter instead of margarine, and definately the kind of peanut butter.  Skip the fake stuff full of chemicals and just use REAL peanut butter.  This turned out fantastic!

I know my mom made a frosting similar to this. I used Organic Peanut Butter, all natural and ran into  trouble with it being greasy because this peanut butter doesn't have any emulsifiers so it actually came together, then "broke" and became lumpy. More sugar helped, but couldn't save it. If I tried this again with this peanut butter, I think I would omit the butter or reduce the peanut butter by 1/2.

I needed to make a cake to auction for a benefit and I am so glad I chose this frosting recipe!  (I did follow another reviewer's recommendations and used 1 stick butter, 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups confectioners sugar and 2 to 3 T milk and I wouldn't deviate from that.)  I put it on a chocolate fudge cake and the people who bought it called me today and raved about it.  I made a double batch of the icing and using 2/3 of it on the 10x13 cake.  We put the leftovers in the fridge and ate some of it with a spoon.  It is smooth and tastes like peanut butter fudge or peanut butter roll.  I will definitely make it again.

This has the makings of a great frosting. I think it needs more peanut butter flavor though and a little less sugar never hurt anyone...so I will try TRindell's suggestions next time.

BIG hit! yum! I have to admit that I didnt have cream so, I used a little Pastry Pride till I got the smooth consistancy I wanted. Man, this was good.
The second time I made this. I only needed 1/2 the peanut butter frosting. So, I made the buttercream first then I took half of it and added the peanut butter and cream to the buttercream and it worked great! Then I had 2 flavors to offer.

I already had a recipe for a Peanut Butter & Jelly cake, but I didn't care for the frosting the recipe came with. This was a perfect replacement! This was nice and fluffy, and tasted great! I am always afraid my frosting is going to be too runny, so I only added little splashes of milk (Heavy Cream was all I had, so I used that) until the consistancy was perfect. It turned out great and the cupcakes were a huge success! Thank you!

Way too much sugar as written. I was happy with flavor but not the look at 2 cups, so went with 3 cups,  was too sweet. Not happy with texture. Would try cornstarch. Guests liked it ok.

OMG this is to die for!  I used it with the Peanut Butter Cake II recipe and then used a chocolate cake to layer in-between the peanut butter cake with this frosting - everyone raved about it.  It was like eating a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup Cake.  So yummy!  One change - less powdered sugar!  2 cups is enough.  It becomes pretty obvious though as your adding the powdered sugar and the dough ends up incredibly thick and you look back and double check the recipe.  I think the 4 cups is a misprint.  Anyways still amazing!

Great recipe! I've made it a couple of times on brownies and everyone loves it. I Have tried it with cream vs milk. The milk recipe seems easier to spread. The cream recipe came out a little bit too dry so I added a little water. :)

Used TRindell's modifications (cutting the sugar by half and using only 2 Tbsp milk rather than 1/3 cup cream), and LOVED it!  My co-workers are going to rave; I can just feel it.

The best peanut butter frosting EVER! I have a hard time not eating it all before putting it on the cake or cupcakes. I add extra peanut butter because to me there is never enough. I have used this on cupcakes and also as a filling in chocolate cake. It is always recieved very well. I love it!

Peanut butter perfection! I'm so pleased with this! I followed some of the reviewers tips, and cut the sugar in half, upped the pb to 1 1/2 cups, and needed just a touch more cream, and it is exactly what I wanted for my fledgling business. I used Reeses brand peanut butter, and it is divine! I almost didn't get one of my own cupcakes!

Great frosting recipe.   Don't get too hung up on proportions.  I added more cream to get the consistency I was after.   The key is using cream instead of milk and beating it into a frenzy.   Makes a fluffy frosting just right for piping onto cupcakes.   Also...not to be a snob, but use brand name creamy peanut butter for the best flavor.

As is this is very sweet and not very peanut buttery. After tasting it when it was first done I wasn't happy with it so I added about a cup more of PB  and 1/4 c extra butter. And cream as needed. It was better then. I used it to frost brownies. Thanks.

I followed the suggestions of TRindell and this frosting was delicious!  I found that the longer I whipped it with my handheld electric mixer the fluffier it got.  Adding small splashes of milk during the beating process helped too.  The texture was fluffy, spreadable, and worked for piping.  The taste: irrisistable!  Buttery, peanutty sweetness.  I ate A LOT out of the bowl.  Will use again and again!

I got great compliments on this frosting. A nice getaway from chocolate and vanilla. I used milk instead of cream and only 2 cups of sugar.

Easy to make and it tastes great on a chocolate fudge cake. I cut it in half and still had enough to frost a 9 x 13 cake. I did add just a bit more milk to make it spread easier. My husband always asks for this frosting  on his birthday cake!!!

It was delicious.  I modified it as others did by halving the powdered sugar and it left me with a nice spreading and piping consistency.  It was super creamy.  I used skim milk instead of cream and it was still super rich as I did use real butter as others had suggested.  I used it to frost chocolate banana cupcakes, topped with a peanut butter cup and it was super delicious.

I chose this recipe because I didn't want to use more than one stick of butter in my frosting.  It was great! I only needed 2 cups of sugar-the 4 has got to be a misprint because even with 1/2 that the frosting is super sweet. I used a full 1/3 cup of whole milk. It was the perfect amount for 24 chocolate cupcakes.

This is my new go-to recipe for peanut butter frosting! I didn't have either milk or cream, so I used half-and-half and it worked beautifully. I also followed other suggestions and cut the sugar in half. This piped beautifully! I made chocolate cupcakes with a mini Reese's PB cup in the middle to go with this frosting. It was a huge hit! My mom commented that it tasted like peanut butter fudge, it was that good! Excellent recipe. Thank you, Suzanne!

When I make a frosting from scratch, and I do a lot of experimenting because we have a lot of food allergies in my home, I know that I will quite often have to adjust. If it is too thin,  add  more confectioner's sugar. If it's too thick, adjust the liquids. So much of baking is having fun and adding in your personal touch. Frostings are just one of those things that seem to work differently for everyone. :) (Point being, I *don't* understand giving this one star - it's frosting, play around with it :)  But you've been given a great jumping off point at the very least, and that's good :) And YES to adding vanilla extract! I'd start with half a TSP and maybe go up to a whole.

I wish I had read the reviews. I made this exactly as written and it was BARELY spreadable. I guess the powdered sugar really does need to be cut down. I will make it again though because the taste was wonderful.

This is one of the few times I have followed the recommendations of reviewers instead of following the original recipe.  I reduced the sugar by half and increased the peanut butter by 1/2 cup. FABULOUS!

Delicious and easy. I read the reviews and I also only used 2 cups of confectioner's [powdered] sugar and I used 1/3 cup milk.  It's a keeper!
I made the "4 egg yellow cake" from this site and filled cupcakes with strawberry jelly, topping them with this wonderful frosting. They were a huge hit at my daughter's school banquet.  Enjoy!

Was wonderful as a filling and frosting for chocolate cupcakes. I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough, used milk in place of cream as well. Everyone loved them!!! Made enough to fill and frost 2 dozen cupcakes.

Very light and fluffy with a mild peanut butter taste. Make sure you beat until nice and fluffy. I only added about 2-3 Tbsp. of milk. Be sure to add a little at a time for the perfect consistency.

I liked the adjustments better than the actual recipe.  1 and 1/2 cup of peanut butter, a tsp of vanilla extract, and less than 2 cups of confectioners sugar make this a wonderful and easy frosting recipe!

delicious! received rave reviews at work (frosted a chocolate cake with this for a co-worker's birthday). I did add a little extra PB (maybe 2-3 Tbs), as i wanted it to taste extra peanut butter-y! several co-workers begged for the recipe... will definitely keep this recipe on hand!

I made this for a friend who loves reeses! And I made this like every frosting I make. Room temperature unsalted unsweetened butter. Just pull it out a few hours before you plan on making it! Microwave for 15 second increments is okay too but check often! You dont want runny butter! 1.5 cups peanut butter, cream together in Kitchenaid, add a few Tbsp of heavy cream, and splash of vanilla, then add powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time until reached desired consistency. I ended up with about 3 cups because I like mine thick for beautiful peaks and piping. I topped with sliced and crumbled dark chocolate bits from a candy bar, on German chocolate cupcakes. :) They were beautiful and delicious!

This frosting is incredibly wonderful! The only tweak I made was at the recommendation of TRindell, who advised cutting the powdered sugar back to 2 cups instead of 4 cups. She was absolutely right! It would have been disastrous to use 4 cups! At 2 cups, the level of sweetness was perfect! I used it as a filling in a triple layer chocolate cake. I also used it to decorate the outside of the cake. It was just the right consistency for that, and it tinted green very well. We'll be using this recipe frequently!

Has the perfect balance of peanut butteriness:) I did add a teaspoon of vanilla for a little more complexity of flavor.

5 stars for taste, but 4 for the recipe. The recipe seems to be off (like others have said) with the 4 c. of confectioners sugar. I only used 2 and needed just slightly more cream than stated to get the proper consistency. Made this way, this is delicious. Thank you!

I'm only giving this recipe four stars because I felt it had way too much powdered sugar.  I followed prior suggestions and did not put as much.  Was delicious after the recommended amounts.

Twice we tried this recipe and did exactly what they said to do. It turned out rocky after we put the 3rd cup of sugar in it. It wasn't creamy like they said it was. Not a very good recipe!

I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loves peanut butter frosting on chocolate cupcakes!  This is a very good recipe. I always add a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract.  A bit of softened cream cheese (when I have a partial brick occupying space in the fridge) is a really good addition.

This recipe is awesome!! Be sure to follow the others and reduce the powdered sugar by half and use REAL butter! Mix the butter and peanut butter FIRST, then SLOWLY add the powdered sugar. We just made the recipe using 2 TBS of Sugar Free Coffee Mate French Vanilla creamer (it was all we had)... but it turned out better than I had ever made it before, and I'd made it a few times!! just a thought...

This frosting is out of this world good. It also had a wonderful consistency so it was easy to work with. I did have to add more cream using the 4 cups confectioners sugar, but had no problems with this recipe at all. I iced chocolate cupcakes with it and they were just wonderful. Thanks for this recipe!

Way too sweet for me. I think the recipe was much better when I used only 2 cups of powdered sugar. I added another cup and totally regretted it. However, texture was great and frosting was easy to pipe.

I am NOT a big fan of peanut butter - at all.  But I had a special request for peanut butter frosting and I found and tried this recipe.  

I was eating it by the spoonful!  WOW!  This frosting is FABULOUS!!!

I doubled the recipe (to frost 48 cupcakes). I didn't have any cream handy, so I used condensed milk.  I also used a stick of plain Crisco instead of butter.  The frosting was light and fluffy and perfectly sweet and peanut-buttery.

Such a simple recipe and such AWESOME flavor!

cut the sugar to 2 cups and peanut butter to 3/4 to 1 cup. Did milk instead of cream but did add about a tablespoon of Philly cream cheese. Tasted great but thats because I had to basically make my own frosting. Put it on the "too much chocolate cake. Had four or five people ask for the recipe.

Recipe as original = 3 stars. It wouldn't have worked.

edit: I just noticed someone had the same idea as I did. Its called "Fluffy peanut butter frosting."

This was so yummy. I only used 2 cups of the powdered sugar though. I think the consistancy would have been too thick with all of it added in. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Delicious! Make sure to not mix to long, or else frosting will become somewhat grainy rather than creamy as it should be... I'm guilty of such.. still tasted amazing but didn't look the way I wished it would have.

I give this only 4 stars because as written the amounts of each ingredient were off, but when I toyed with it the outcome was really outstanding. The peanutty taste depends on your brand of peanut butter so buy a good quality one (I use JIF). I use more peanut butter, less butter and less sugar (4 cups? No way!!) and I just play around with the amounts until I get the flavor I want, if it's not peanutty enough or if it's too sweet I add more peanut butter, if it's not sweet enough I add more sugar, if it's too thick I add more milk. Simple as that. This comes out very soft and fluffy (but it you want a stiffer frosting use more peanut butter/sugar and less milk). The trick to getting this to a beautiful soft, light consistency is to soften the butter a bit in the microwave and beat it really well.

Really good frosting and I would make it again with some additional modifications. I altered the recipe to be vegan, using vegan butter and unsweetened almond milk instead of cream. I only used 3 cups of sugar, I'll probably just use 2 next time. I would also reduce the amount of butter a bit, but that's not a big deal. It still made a wonderful filling for my chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting between the layers. I used organic peanut butter, the kind you need to mix up due to separation, and it was still great. Thanks for the recipe!

For my taste this was FANTASTIC!!! I have to admit the peanut butter flavor was mild, but it was sooooooo good! I had to fight my parents to lick the spoon and beaters after making it! This tastes AMAZING on chocolate cake or on chocolate cupcakes, like I made.  It is sweet, but that is what frosting is, right? I didn't change the recipe at all except for the amount of cream.  I added a few tablespoons more than the recipe calls for because my frosting was too stiff to spread. This recipe makes a thick, yet somehow fluffy, creamy, lightly peanut butter flavored, delicious frosting! By the way, I used JIF creamy peanut butter and heavy whipping cream.

Definitely follow the suggestions to use more peanut butter (1 1/2 cups), beat the PB and the butter until REALLY light and fluffy before adding sugar, and don't used 4 cups of sugar. I added the sugar alternating with the milk and used just under 3 cups. Wonderful peanut butter flavor.

My husband is a peanut butter freak and he LOVES this frosting.  Used cheapo peanut butter and margarine.  Awesome!  Doesn't work well as a decorator icing, but not a big deal.  It's all about the flavor.

Insanely good! Fabulous as written, thanks! Oh, and we used cheepo store brand peanut butter and it was fabulous, so I am not so sure that you should run out and get name brand peanut butter for this one!

I made this as the icing to go in peanut butter cake balls and it worked out perfectly.  Yum!  I will definitely make it for the cake balls again and other things too.  It was easy and fast.

I made a peanut butter cake from scratch and used this frosting. I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar and a tablespoon more of PB, as it had more of a sugar-y taste without the extra TBSP. Tasted like PB fudge!

This is the Peanut Butter Frosting recipe you are looking for!  So good - So easy - like a fluffier version of old fashioned peanut butter fudge.  I served mine on a Devil's Food cake and it was PERFECTION! Just one note - I live in a dry climate so I had to use about 1/2 cup cream rather than 1/3 cup.

I love the way that this frosting tasted, like another reviewer stated, it tasted very much like the inside of a peanut butter cup to me(not the texture though). I used half the sugar and room temperature butter and peanut butter, and beat and beat and beat it. I was able to get the frosting nice and fluffy, and it worked well for my purpose which was between layers of a 3 layer cake, but I wouldn't have been able to frost the whole cake with it(hence the 4 stars). It may have even been too fluffy for the outside? I'm not sure if I did everything right as this was my first frosting excursion... but the taste MADE my cake!!

Excellent recipe. I used milk instead of cream and this went superb with my banana cake. I needed to double it to have enough to ice a 3 layer cake. (We like lots of icing) I also added a tsp of vanilla.

You cannot make this recipe as it is! It's horrible; tastes like butter. Definitely halve the butter if you try this recipe. I even used about 1 1/2 cups peanut butter trying to make this taste better. I only made this because my usual recipe calls for crisco, and I didn't have any. What an absolute waste of good ingredients. Deleting this from my recipe box immediately!

My boyfriend asked for a chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting for his birthday.  His mother used to make one every year, but he was a little wary of letting someone else make it, convinced it wouldn't be as good.  After one slice of his cake, he declared "my" version better than his mother's.  Now he wants me to make it for EVERY occasion, and I actually don't mind, it's so easy.  I used about two cups of powdered sugar and doubled the peanut butter, which works well if you're using a good creamy peanut butter.  I started with two cups of powdered sugar and one cup of peanut butter, but it was still mostly sweet and not terribly peanut buttery.  True peanut butter fans say they are glad I made that little change.

This recipe is great.  I used 2 cups of powdered sugar.  To me, 4 cups of sugar would have sent me into sugar overload.  This recipe is super easy and super quick.  Great on top of chocolate cake with chocolate chips!

This is pretty good but after making it a couple times I've had trouble getting the consistency to be right. I think adding just 3 cups of sugar instead of 4 might be better.

Also, everyone probably already knows this but I didn't the first time I made it because it was the first frosting I made. But you need to use REAL butter, not margarine and it needs to be room temperature, not melted in the microwave or anything. In addition to that it needs to be mixed for at least 10 minutes (in my experience) for that first blend (with the peanut butter and butter).

Next time I'll probably do 3 cups of sugar though. Otherwise it's quite yummy. My peanut butter freak husband loves it and only wants this for his frosting when I make him cakes and cupcakes for his birthday.

This recipe has way too much sugar, and not enough peanut butter. I would increase PB by 1/2 cup, and cut the sugar in half. Use heavy whipping cream instead of cream or milk. And add just a 1/4 tsp of vanilla with the cream - then you'll have a good peanut butter icing recipe!

We made this tonight.  We followed the recipe almost exactly.  The frosting was incredible.  I am not a huge peanut butter fan but I literally loved this.  We used real butter.  We only deviated from the recipe with adding the cream.  We added 2 ounces at a time until we reached the consistency we liked.  Perfection! Yum!

I asked my kids what they'd rate this recipe, my son said 'ten hundred' and my daughter said 'four' I feel it's around a 4.5 so 5 is good :) 
We didn't have cream, so just used 2% milk, and added a bit more than 1/3 cup because it was still a bit thick for us. Really delicious recipe :)

This is a great recipe for peanut butter frosting. I cut the recipe in half for a smaller batch of cupcakes and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt.  Delicious!  It tasted smooth and sweet and not overpowering.  A definite keeper!  :)

So given all the rave reviews, I decided to try this recipe (my first ever attempt to make peanut butter frosting) and was VERY disappointed. I found it, as did some other reviewers way too greasy and definitely not the smooth, "swirlable" texture I expect in a frosting.

Maybe it was a mistake on my part, but I would have preferred a bit more peanut butter flavour to it. I'd recommend to moderate sugar to taste. But I loved it!

Was just what I was looking for - used regular milk because it was all I had.  I think I used a little more milk than it called for - but frosting came out great!

So yummy! It works great with low-fat milk instead of cream. But keep adding milk little by little as you beat the frosting because it'll need more milk and more mixing than you might expect to start acting like a creamy, smooth frosting.

OMG!! This was awesome.  I ended up adding a tad more milk so the frosting was easier to pipe on.  Love this one- Thank you for sharing.

Great frosting.  I made it with one cube of real butter and 1 1/2 Jiff peanut butter both at room temp., creaming them together, then I added the three cups of powdered sugar, one cup at a time, gradually adding the cream, (I used half and half).  It turned out very fluffy and yummy.  I just put it on a triple chocolate fudge cake from a box.  It was amazing.  My family loved it.

thanks TRindell! With your recipe, I rate this 5 stars. I think if I had followed as is, it would have been much too sweet for my taste. I followed your recipe but added more cream to thin out the frosting to my desired consistency. It was soooooo good! the best tasting PB frosting ever! I plan on using this frosting to make PB sandwich cookies!

I used much less sugar than this recipe called for (about a cup and 1 half of confectioners sugar) and the frosting came out creamy and delicious.

The only thing I changed was the confectioner's sugar.  I only used 2 cups instead of 4.  It was still sweet, creamy and delicious!

Yikes! I've tried this frosting before and it's true, the quality of the PB sure does matter. In an effort to be health conscious I tried Bettr'n Peanut Butter and it was a miserable fail. The texture was too runny (that was even BEFORE any milk was added) and it still lacked that PB taste. Next time I make it I will for sure use JIF again. Reason for the 4 stars is I've made it in the past with JIF and it was a hit.

Peanut butter is not my fav. but this frosting is the best thing I've ever had!!! I took TRindell's suggestions and made it just like that, using peter pan peanut butter and it was so good. Not sure the cupcakes are good enough for this creamy fluffy frosting!

This was AWESOME!!! I made homemade fudge style brownies and topped it with this wonderful frosting. WOW my family really enjoyed it. I made the recipe exactly and then added some sea salt to top off. Will definitely be making more in the future. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was soooo good on some chocolate cupcakes.  It was too stiff so I had to add about 2-3 T more of cream.  It was perfect though so I'll make it again many times!

I had some trouble with this, but I am 99% sure that was due to having to use crunchy natural-style peanut butter. It was excellent anyway (if horrible to spread) on the Banana Cake IV on this site.

Amazing!!! I thought I was going to be sick because I couldn't stop eating it! Lol The cream I used was Heavy Whipping Cream because it's what I had in the fridge. That's probably why I had to add a little more liquid to thin it out, but it was fantastic.

I make this as directed, the only slight change is after mixing in the last 2 cups of powdered sugar I just add more cream without measuring until I get the fluffy consistency I'm looking for. If I had to guess I'd say I add a little less than 1/4 of a cup of cream at the end. My whole family LOVES this frosting-it's a struggle to keep my husband from eating it up before I can frost something with it! I use butter, not margarine, and Skippy creamy peanut butter. Definitely one of my faves!

Fabulous on your homemade cinnamon rolls, make it a little thinner so it spreads/pours. When I lived in Gunnison, CO during the mid 70's, the local Cattlemen's Restaurant served huge cinnamon rolls with peanut butter frosting. My recipe is 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1/4 c. peanut butter, 3/4 tsp. vanilla and enough milk (add by Tbls) to make it spreadable. ENJOY

Fabulous icing!!  I doubled the peanut butter and halved the confectioners sugar.  This turned out to be the creamiest and best icing i've made to date [peanut butter wise].  I then doubled the whole thing to put a luxurious amount on a chocolate layer cake.  My daughter adored it!  I definitely recommend this with the added peanut butter and lessened confectioners sugar.  It gave it the correct flavor that i was searching for.

WOW is all I can say!!! I recommend you use butter, not margarine. Also, eggs, butter, milk( or any cold ingredient) usually always needs to be used at room temp. Quality ingredients also matter, so dont skimp on the peanut butter with a generic.

Only gave this four starts since I used TRindell modifications (Reviewed on Apr. 26, 2005). This frosting was absolutely FANTASTIC! My peanut butter husband LOVED the cupcakes I made him. The frosting had somewhat of a thick consistency, but it was super tasty. I will definitely be making this again and again!

This frosting was FABULOUS!!  However, following the recipe exactly as it was left it very stiff and difficult to pipe.  I'm not sure if it was the dry weather we are experiencing or if it just needed more liquid, but we ended up squeezing it back into the mixer and adding nearly 1/3 c. EXTRA cream and fluffing it for quite a while.  My daughter made chocolate cupcakes with this frosting for a staff luncheon and got MANY compliments.

I use this recipe often and love it.  I is so good on chocolate cake.  I would recommend not using the 4 cups of confectioners sugar.  I use 2 cups and it turns out perfect.  I also use 3 tablespoons of milk instead of the cream.  Comes out perfect every time.  If using box cake I like to add 1 cup of sour cream, 1 package of instant pudding to the mix.  Or look up the Breakstone's triple chocolate cake on this site.

Delicious! This was a good consistency & actually tasted like peanut butter, not just powdered sugar! Even though the recipe says you can substitute milk for cream, I would definitely recommend sticking to the cream. It definitely makes a difference.

I used the modified version with 1 c peanut butter and 1 c butter, 2 c powered sugar. But had to use vanilla soymilk instead of milk or cream because we had ran out of either. Still turned out wonderful and had a nice consistency for frosting.

I was looking for a recipe for peanut butter frosting that actually tasted like peanut butter instead of just an overdose of powdered sugar.  This recipe is by far one of the best I have ever tasted.  I took the advice of some other reviews and did not add 4 cups of sugar, I used 2 cups instead and increased the peanut butter to 1 and 1/4 cups.  I only added enough milk to get the consistency I wanted so I'm unsure of that measurement.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thank you so much for sharing it.  I generously frosted my entire cake 9x13 cake and ate the rest of the frosting right from the bowl.

This was great with again, some alterations. I needed a double batch but was afraid to double the recipe the way it read so this is what I did and it came absolutely scrumptious. Mixed together 2 sticks of real butter, 2 full cups of good peanut butter. Then added 3 cups of confectioner sugar and 6 tablespoons of heavy cream.  What a great icing to my cake.

This did not spread at all.  It actually worked better when I used my hands and molded it to the cake.  It tasted wonderful though.

I use this to frost the 'Deep Dish Brownies' also from this site.  Cut them into bite size pieces, they are to die for!  Everyone loves them.  So good, I am making them for a birthday party tomorrow!! They will always be a hit.

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and increased the PB to 1-1/2 cups.  I kept the cream and honestly can't imagine this frosting without the cream.  It was actually, well, creamy.  I don't like stiff frostings.  I made shallow peanut butter cookie cups and melted chocolate chips inside the bottom of the cookie shell, let it cool and then frosted them with this frosting.  Yum.

This frosting is FANTASTIC.  Light, sweet-but-not-too-sweet, perfect amount of peanut butter taste.  I reduced it to just 4 servings (I was making cupcakes and a few different frostings), and I used skim milk instead of cream (that's what I had) and added just a touch more milk to make it a bit lighter.  It was fantastic.    Also, tip: substitute nutella for the peanut butter.  Leave everything else the same.  AMAZING.

Very good recipe. I used this frosting when making a Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake. I didn't have cream so I used milk. I also took other's advice and used only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar.

Really good peanut butter frosting!  I did use the modifications recommended by TRindell.  I am not crazy about peanut butter so I am not the best judge on taste, however my son LOVES peanut butter and he licked the beaters and bowl then tried to sneak fingerfuls from the iced cake.

I've been using Allrecipes for years and this is the first review I'm writing!  I've used this recipe many times and it always turns out awesome.  But of course today, on my husband's b-day, the frosting "flopped".  It was greasy & un-spreadable and I couldn't figure out what went wrong.  I had enough ingredients to start over and the only thing I can figure is that on the first batch (the one that went wrong) I was at the bottom of the peanut-butter jar.  I think that the peanut-butter settles and when I started over using a fresh jar it worked perfect.  I have 3 children so we go through peanutbutter quickly so I know it wasn't old, I just think it was greasier because it was toward the end.  So...if you haven't stirred your PB everytime you open the jar, make sure you are starting with a fresh one!  Like other reviewers, I cut the sugar and one other tip, I like to stick the butter & PB in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds just until the butter starts to melt and it comes out super creamy and takes away any of that "gritiness" you sometimes get with PB.

YUM.  First time making peanut butter frosting, and I will definitely use this recipe again.  I used it to frost chocolate cake mix cookies when I wanted something fast and didn't have enough flour to make cookies from scratch.  Can't wait to try this on cupcakes!

This is awesome!!  I made 1/2 a batch, added chopped Reese's PB Cups and used it for the filling in a double layer brownie cake.  I used natural peanut butter and milk and it turned out great!  Definitely saving this recipe!! :)

I used the advice of others used good peanut butter and lightened it up. Then I made a triple chocolate cake, layered the frosting in the middle and on top and then made a triple chololate ganache out of butter, semi-sweet choc chips, milk, and hersheys mini bars of dark choc and milk choc and drizzled the ganache over the chilled cake. Oh! It was a peanut butter cup lovers dream and was like chili's molten cakes. Awesome recipe!!!

This is the way I have always made my peanut butter frosting. It is fantastic and gets rave reviews every time! I do reduce the amount of powdered sugar slightly and add a teaspoon of vanilla. This recipe is a winner! :)

I followed the suggestion on one of the other reviewes and used 2 cups of confectioners sugar and only needed 1/4cup of the cream.  It turned out perfect!!

Fabulous! This recipe was perfect. not to sweet and not to undersweet my kids loved it and I loved giving them a frosting that wasn't storebought and overly sweet.I did end up using only 3 cups of sugar and maybe a tablespoon more cream than the recipe called for to make it creamier.

This was a hit! I also halved the powdered sugar and added a bit more cream to taste. I layered it with a chocolate cake and it was very good. Just try not to eat too much frosting off of the spoon before frosting your cake!

I think this recipe needs a little tweaking as written.  That is why I gave it four stars.  I used 1 cup peanut butter (needs to be name brand), 1 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 3 TBSP milk. I creamed together the peanut butter and butter poured in the powdered sugar, added the milk and mixed with my hand mixer.  Very creamy and delicious!! I am glad I read the reviews before adding 4 Cups of powdered sugar.  Would have been way too sweet! This is the right balance.

The taste was amazing, but it certainly didn't "whip" like it said it would.  Mine turned out very pasty, even after cutting the sugar in half, but worked GREAT with what I made.  I used a devils food cake mix made with milk instead of water, layered the PB frosting between the three cake layers, and frosted it with a tub of purchased chocolate frosting, finishing it off with Reeses Pieces on top- the PB frosting MADE the cake, it was the texture of the middle of a Reeses cup, and therefore AMAZING.  Worked out good for me, and great for dipping apples in, but not what I was expecting by the "advertising".

This frosting was very good.  I followed some of the instructions of the person below me and it turned out yummy.  I found that I did have to add a bit more milk than suggested as well.  Did use margarine.  It turned out just fine.  Jiffy Peanut Butter is best to use, in my opinion.

It couldn't have been better.  My uncle remembered an angel food with PB frosting from his childhood.  This worked.  I agree that using a "good" PB made all the difference.  JIF is my only PB.

I took the advice of lessening the confectioners sugar, leaving the butter and peanut butter out to sit at room temperature. I also used cream, 4 tblspns. I took my time and blended everything really well. I loved this recipe. My mother had been looking for a good peanut butter recipe for tne longest and this was it. I loved it.

I made the recipe as Trindell said, but used a little less sugar and a little more milk to make it a smoother, softer consistency. 
Hubby LOVED it at first bite. We'll see if it's a hit at work tomorrow. 

I personally LOVED it. Jif is important and well as room temp butter. I left mine out for about 4 hours. Came out PERFECT! 

Thank you Trindell and Susan.

A lovely frosting.  I used this on "Lisa's Chocolate Chip Chocolate Cake" from this site (using 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 chocolate chips in the batter).  My daughter requested this for her graduation party, and it won raves.  The frosting was the perfect combination of peanut butter and sweetness, and I did not find it greasy at all.  I didn't use all  the cream called for, but that was personal preference.  A great find--thanks!

I used this to frost my brownies that I took into work, and everyone loved it. I did cut the recipe in half and I'm glad I did, there was definitely enough to cover a 13x9 pan. The recipe was simple and easy to whip up in no time. Next time I make a chocolate cake I will definitley use this to frost it. Thank you for the recipe.

I used the whole box of conf. sugar which is 3-3/4 cups and added  extra milk(1 Tbsp. at a time) to give it a more spreading consistency. This was a big hit with everybody.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I listened to all the other posters and used 1-1/2 cups of peanut butter and only 2 cups of sugar. I used it on chocolate cake and it was delicious. It was very creamy and not too sweet. I will definitely use it in the future!

I tried this recipe for my son's chocolate birthday cake.  It was really awful.  I followed the recipe with the suggestion of adding more peanutbutter and less powdered sugar.  It was still terrible.  The taste was fine, but the texture was like greasy, gooey fudge, not nice, fluffy frosting.

This recipe was awful.  The directions are in conflict with the ingredients.  The ingredients include 1/3 cup of cream but when you get to the directions it says add a 1/4 cup of the cream.  I assumed that it meant 1/4 of the 1/3rd cup.  However, with that much confectioners sugar, it ended up with no peanut butter taste and was difficult to work with.  I won't use it again, and I should have read the other reviews first.  It was disappointing at best and I get alot of great recipes from this website.

AFTER MODIFICATION this makes a very good peanut butter frosting, and not sickening sweet or fat. For the record, modification is just about halving amount of sugar. As for me, I used milk because I didn't want to open a bottle of cream, but it would be as good with cream. I may try to use cream cheese in lieu of butter next time...

With modification this recipe is excellent, but alone, not so great.  I halved the butter and the sugar.  I used part margarine as I only had 1 Tbsp butter left.  I added about 1/3 cup peanut butter and slightly increased the milk until it was the right consistency.  I used it to top peanut butter chip brownies.

This frosting had a good taste, but was way too runny. I took everyone's advice about the sugar and peanut butter.I had to substitute milk for the cream b/c I live in Venezuela and cream is hard to come by. I also added a little cream cheese to try and thicken it up. It tasted good with the chocolate cake, but frosting the sides of this round cake was more than difficult!

Excellent. I used milk instead of cream and had to use a bit more then the recipe called for, but it spread easily and tasted great on peanut butter chocolate chip cupcakes.  Thanks!

Even after adding an extra 1/4 cup peanut butter, this frosting still tasted more like butter (grease) than peanut butter.  I also cut the powdered sugar in half, and although it turned out very creamy, it just didn't taste that great.  I probably won't use this recipe again.  Sorry.

This will be best to use as a filling, or on a sheet cake-it doesn't do well on the sides of a cake.Also agree that you don't need as much sugar as the recipe calls for

I found that this recipe was easy, and fabulous!  It made a lot of frosting!  We frosted our cake then made lots of grahm crackers with peanut butter frosting.  It was wonderful, the kids cried when I said "no more today!"  The kids even helped make it.

I made it exactly as directed, next time I will add a bit more cream (1/2 cup rather than 1/3 cup) to make it spread easier. It made plenty to cover 24 cupcakes, did not need to scrimp.

Unbelievable. This is the best frosting I've ever made. It made more than enough for 2 stacked 9" rounds. I could have put more on the middle layer had I known it made so much. Use only 2 cups of confectioners sugar, any more would be crazy. Also, make SURE your butter (do not use margarine) is room temperature. This will be my new go to frosting recipe!

Makes more than enough to Frost a 9x13 cake so I froze the rest (not sure how it freezes so will see). Also I had to add a lot more than 1/3 cup of heavy cream. Not sure how much exactly but just eye ball it until it’s the consistency that you like. It’s pretty sweet so may want to start off with 3 cups confectioners sugar to start. You can always add more

I read the reviews and thought that this would be a good recipe to try.  I followed the advice of others but found that it was a bit oily and if I had added the recipe amount of powdered sugar it wouldn't have been able to mix it.  As it was I had to use a lot more cream (didn't keep track, sorry).  All in all it was a bit of a disappointment.

Great peanut butter frosting!  I started with only half of the sugar (2 cups) and found the sweetness was perfect, so I didn't add the remaining 2 cups.  I also added in 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  My husband thought the frosting tasted like Reese's Pieces, which is pretty accurate!  This frosting was perfect on top of chocolate cupcakes I made for my daughter's birthday.  This recipe is a keeper!

Used 16 ounce Jif Peanut Butter, 1/2 cup butter (1 stick), 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, along with 2 sifted 10X sugar.
Beat the PB and butter first; add vanilla, add 10X sugar; beat again; Added 3 full tablespoons heavy whipping cream.  Beat for 5 minutes.  EXCELLENT!

I've used this on angel food cake and it is delicious.  My family is always begging for my peanut butter cake.  I agree with the person about the peanut butter.  Don't use the stores' brand.  Use a good brand like skippy's or Jiff.

This is the best Peanut butter icing I have ever tasted !!!!
I made a 3 layer devil's  food cake as a thank you gift, so I made a batch and half. I have enough left over for some cupcakes I'll bake tomorrow for the grandchildren.
Wow !!! It was amazing !!! I hope my neighbor likes it. He shoveled our car out of 30 inches of snow. That's what I call a great neighbor !!!!

This is an amazing frosting recipe! I've never made a good frosting, but this one turned out wonderfully. I reduced the recipe a bit, only because I didn't need the entire amount. It tasted great! I would so make this again!

AMAZING.   This is the most delicious Peanut Butter cream frosting.  It smelled and tasted just like a Reese's Cup.  I made a chocolate two layer cake and there was plenty for the entire cake and I scaled the confectioner sugar to 2 cups as others suggested and it was perfect.  Thank you for sharing.  I cannot wait to make this again

Awesome! I like sweet butter cream frostings - this one is it!  I accidentally made the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe last time and was disappointed.  It doesn't compare to this one.  This one is still fluffy (when you follow the recipe). be sure all ingredients are room temp.  As another reviewer stated, don't add more milk/cream, just warm the slightest bit if not as spreadable as you want.

Amazing! I followed the advice of other reviewers & used 2 cups of powdered sugar rather than 4 cups, 2-3 Tbsp of cream & a splash of vanilla. I whipped it on high in my kitchen aid & it turned out light & fluffy & full of peanut butter flavor! Reminds me of the frosting on my favorite chocolate peanut butter cupcakes from a local cupcake shop. Definitely a keeper!

Made it several times now. Once, I followed it exactly and it was delicious. The second time, I used about 3/4 cup less powdered sugar (and as a side note, for frosting, I always sift my powdered sugar), and 1/4 cup whole milk, then 1/4 cup heavy cream; just as yummy. Great recipe. Super easy.

This icing was delicious and fabulous to top off anything chocolate. I added the vanilla as suggested in the video, used milk instead of cream, and added only 3 cups of confectioners sugar. This will be my go to peanut butter icing recipe.

I made this frosting for my chocolate peanut butter cup cakes. It was a huge hit! I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. It was delicious and held up beautifully (no melting/running) for poolside birthday cupcakes on a warm day!

I followed the recipe but split the difference with regard to powdered sugar. The recipe calls for 4 cups; others suggested 2 cups. I used 3 cups.  (I also had to add a T more milk to smooth it out.)  It piped beautifully and tasted great!

I have searched for years for the perfect homemade pizza crust recipe, and this is it! We recently ate at Mellow Mushroom for the first time, and I loved the crust. I found your copycat recipe and gave it a try, and it baked up perfectly on my pizza stone. I had to increase the bread flour to a full 4 cups, because my dough was sticky, but it rose beautifully, and baked up with a deliciously crisp bubbly chewy crust! Thank you for this recipe, I will be using it alot!

Awesome recipe, with slight modifications. I only used 1 3/4 cup confectioners sugar, I used 2% milk instead of cream and added quite a bit to make it light and fluffy.  Delicious on a 9x13 chocolate cake but will be making cupcakes too :)

Amazing!!! I followed the advice of TRindell and used 2 cups of confectioners sugar vs 4 and 3 tablespoons of milk. I also added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and all I can say is WOW!  I made this for chocolate cupcakes and my family couldn't stop raving .... Or eating.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just wanted to say my own little version of peanut butter frosting. I used a stick of butter, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 3 cups of powdered sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and a small dash of cinnomen. Mix all ingredients except for the milk first, then slowly add the milk. It ends up very creamy and delicious! My friends all thought it was to die for! I learned, and edited this recipe from a cupcake baking book I just recieved for my birthday. ;-) Enjoy!

This recipe works beautifully to create frosting that has a light, fluffy texture. I gave it four stars simply because I think sugar content is way too high. I added only enough to suite my taste, and didn't use anywhere near 4 cups of sugar. It beat up nicely and spread so smoothly over a 9x13 cake. I say use your favorite peanut butter, and add sugar to your own taste. You may need to adjust the liquid to your desired consistency as well. This is now my favorite PB frosting! Just the smell had my boys begging for a spoonful...or three. Thanks for sharing, Suzanne!

This recipe tasted great! Tasted almost like the inside of a Reese's cup. But the only thing I didn't like was the fact that once it's sat you had a lot of oil dripping off, I used. A reduced fat peanut butter I have used in several recipes so not sure why. I did reduce the powdered sugar to 2 1/2 cups like one of the post recommended. All in all still a very yummy recipe.

Do not care for this frosting at all. Very greasy appearance and hard to get it to stay on the cake. Would not recommend for use.

OK, I modified this one. 1) I used Smuckers Natural PB, the one that only has peanuts and salt, and separates in the jar. 2) I did not use any butter or margarine. I wanted the most peanut flavor, so I used 1.5 cups of PB, which ended up to be the full jar. 3) I used 2 cups of powdered sugar. 4) I added extra salt to get a more Reese's cup flavor out of the mix, since I was going to spread it on an 'extreme chocolate cake'. 5) I didn't measure my cream, I just put in what looked right.

Now, I ended up with something that looked a bit broken and oily/shiny. I think this is because my PB was *warm*. I keep my house on the warm side of room temp, so my PB was *soft* and this brand tends to separate anyway. I put some leftover frosting into the fridge, and discovered that once it was fully chilled, I could mix it up without it being all shiny. So if you get an oily/shiny/broken looking frosting, chill it well and give it another mix before spreading it. I did not do this, so my frosting looked shiny and weird...but it tasted great and got great reviews.

I am very glad I added extra salt. This frosting on the chocolate cake was preferred by my adult guests over the same chocolate cake with an excellent chocolate buttercream frosting, even though it was ugly. :)

Next time I'm going to refrigerate my PB before mixing. Four stars for the basis of the recipe. A fifth star next year if I can eliminate the shine with refrigeration.

Incredible frosting and wonderful for chocolate cupcakes! The frosting is definitely the star in whatever it's on, though, so be careful the cake isn't too sweet.

This is a great, no-frills frosting recipe. I used it on a chocolate birthday cake, and kids and grown-ups alike all raved about it. Lack of refrigeration was going to be an issue, so I substituted Crisco for the butter, and water for the cream and it still tasted wonderful. I also took the advice of another user and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. This has gone into my recipe box and I will definitely make again.

After reading other reviews, I made a few changes. I only used 3 cups confectioner's sugar and it was perfect. It is a very thick icing just so you know... I had to blow outs so I resorted to icing with a knife. Excellent flavor and great texture! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was super easy to make and was a really big hit with all 10 people who were at dinner last night. I'd frosted a 9x15 cake and had all of 2 servings left once everyone had left.  My husband was especially surprised by how good the frosting is.  Normally he goes for a center piece to avoid the frosting and grabbed a corner piece when he went back for seconds.

After making the recipe exactly as stated I thought it needed a more peanut buttery taste. I used Skippy peanut butter and used 1/2 cup more than the recipe called for and 1 tsp. of vanilla. It turned out delicious!

Ended up adding more peanut butter, when made as written all I could taste was the confectioner's sugar. My husband thought it was too heavy so I had to add more cream. Not one I'll make again.

one of the best frostings i have ever tried. did not over power, but accented the chocolate cake very well. what i get tired of, are reviewers who clearly do not take into consideration each and every step. i have seen other recipes suffer in ratings because of this. i will be using this recipe many times in the future!

Great! I used half and half instead of cream and it seemed to work fine.  I think I used closer to 1/2 cup because I was using a pastry decorator and at first it  was too stiff and would not stick to the cake.

This is a really great P-nut butter frosting because of it's creamy texture. I think adding cream is what makes this one a keeper. I've tried others, but this one is the best so far. Drizzling fudge sauce on top and sprinkling with Kosher Salt took it over the top. They were given to my wonderful neighbor for mowing my lawn! His review; FANTASTIC Candice. Will you please make me some more. LOL!

I really like this recipe, made as stated but use milk instead of cream, but the recipe said to do this if needed. This does taste as the peanut butter filling of the cups but mabey a littlr richer, still very good though, frosted the black magic cake recipe also on this site a should try nice airy cake they both go good together.

I only used 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar because I don't like terribly sweet frosting.  Given the reduction in sugar, I did not add any additional milk after the first 1/4 cup. I could have just sat down and eaten the entire bowl it was so good!  I put it on banana cupcakes.  Delicious!  My version gets five stars, but I'm giving the original four stars since it would have been too sweet for my taste as is.

This recipe turned out horribly for me.  Yes, I used butter and yes I used good quality peanut butter. I suspect my PB was *too* good of quality, though.  I used the kind with just peanuts, salt and oil in the ingredient list.  My frosting came out disgustingly oily and was virtually un-spreadable.

This was amazing!  I followed TRindell's changes and did 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup PB and mix it well.  Added 2 cups powdered sugar and vanilla.  Then added milk till I got the consistency that I wanted for piping on cupcakes.  I used it on chocolate cupcakes and then drizzled chocolate peanut butter ganache over top.

This was a great recipe.  It can be improved in a few ways though, as other reviewers have stated.  This is what I did:
Cream 1 cup (minus a Tbsp) margarine (or butter) with 1 cup peanut butter. Add 1/4 tsp butter flavouring if you used margarine, and add 1/8tsp salt.  Whip in two egg whites.  Add 2 cups confectioners sugar and 1Tbsp milk.  Add additional milk if needed.
I think the salt made a big difference.  It made it taste more peanut buttery and less overwhelmingly sweet (also helped by halving the sugar).  It made it nice and fluffy, creamy, and tasty!

Yum!  I love this frosting.  It's nice and thick yet fluffy and everyone loves it on pretty much anything.  I followed everyone's suggestion to only use 2 cups of powdered sugar as 4 seemed a bit excessive.  The only problem I have is not eating it all before it gets on the cake!

I have made this frosting 3 times.  once with huge success and twice with miserable failure.  I do NOT know what the trick is but this frosting goes from lovely to grainy in seconds and I am not aware of a way to fix it once grainy/greasy.

I made this as written, only adding a little more cream to get a piping consistency.  It was wonderful and the perfect compliment to the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes.

I agree strongly with Trindell! Whoever have this a 1 star and said it was oily prob did use old or generic peanut butter then mixed it with margarine which is extremely oily! Peanut butter is already oily to begin with some pairing it was something oily will be a disaster! I def plan on using this recipe a lot!! I think the cream gives it a more velvet type of feel and it was AMAZING! I paired this icing with a belgium chocolate cupcake filled with chocolate ganache and it was the best thing I have ever tasted and about 26 other people's favorite so kudos..you did a spectacular job!!!!

Very good! I only used 1/2 cup peanut butter because I was wanting a light tan color so I had to increase the cream slightly. Other than that followed the recipe.

Before I made this frosting for my 3 year old's birthday cake; I read the reviews.  I chose Jiffy Peanut butter and actually ended up using almost a whole container of the stuff.  I used 1 stick of butter, not margarine and also used a little over 2 cups of confectioners sugar (mixed in a bit over 2 cups to get the texture right).   I also added a bit of vanilla to it as well to enhance the flavor (again to taste).  At first when I was tasting this recipe after all was mixed and creamy; the texture was great; but it tasted very buttery as the butter was still warm.  I put the bowl in the fridge covered in plastic wrap and tasted it in the morning...WOW!!! This is a fantastic peanut butter frosting.  I had to bring out the frosting and let sit at room temp for a bit in order for it to be spreadable (using a pastry bag & tip).  This almost tasted like peanut butter fudge.  My husband wants me to make this again only to make peanut butter/chocolate balls out of them instead.  This is a great frosting, but the recipe did need to be "tweaked" just a bit. Oh, and the kids went crazy for it!!

Instead of using confectioners' suger (10X) have you ever used the premade vanilla icings and just added the peanut butter, butter and milk.  My family are lovers of choc. cake and p.b. icing.  We have started using the premade icing and it is to die for.  If you like a sweater taste use cream cheese icing butter, p.b. and milk.

The orgnial gets one star bc i think it would be absoultly awful if u make it with the amounts it says to,i did only use 1 cup of peanut butter n kept adding more sugar to see if it would get it more creamy n it didnt so i stopped at 2 1/2 cups bc it was starting to get a little too sweet. also i only did 3 tbs of milk then a splash of milk, a splash of coffe creamer, some cream cheese and it turned out alright not great but okay,it made a huge amount and i think i probably put too much on my cake, havent tried it yet. But i did make a mini cake and frost it (even after frosting both i had frosting left over) and it was pretty good,I put this on a double layer Black Magic cake

Delicious peanut butter frosting recipe! I did find that I did not need to use all of the powdered sugar that the recipe called for. In fact, a only used half of what the recipe suggested. It was perfectly sweet and spreadable to put on top of the chocolate chip brownies I made. As another note, I had almond milk creamer instead of dairy creamer and the recipe still came out great. I did find the need to slightly increase the cream amount to get the desired texture, but not by much.

Great! I used the modification in the review below this one and it worked very well. I used on chocolate brownies and decorated with mini chocolate chips. My family thought I ordered the dessert from a bakery.

I wasn't pleased with the consistency of the frosting, as it is described in the recipe. It wasn't as firm or stiff as I wanted it to be. I know the solution to this is to add more confectionery sugar. Flavor wise, it's delish.

I did as some of the others did,  and reduced the powdered sugar to 2 cups, used 1 stick of BUTTER and 1 heaping cup of Jif peanut butter...creamy. I added a pinch of salt and a tsp of vanilla and less than 1/4 Cup of cream, and it was AWESOME!!  Whip the heck out of it before you add the sugar and again before you add the cream. Light, fluffy and VERY tasty on chocolate cake!

With the changes this would be 5 stars! 1 stick butter(room temp), 1 cup peanut butter, 2 cups powered sugar, 3 tbsp heavy cream. This was amazing! Frosted a layered chocolate cake and added peanut butter cups to the filling. I could have just eaten the frosting out of the mixer it was so amazing and not overly sweet.

Super easy frosting!  I should of stopped at 2 cups of the sugar (it seem to be the perfect balace of sweetness) but i ended up using 3 cups of the sugar, which was still too sweet for me.  I say if you like it sugary, but 3 cups, but if more peanut butter sweet tasting 2 or 2 1/4 is plenty.

Was fantastic when I altered to use natural creamy peanut butter.  Reduced butter to 1/4 cup and reduced confectioner's sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Was fantastic!  Very peanut-buttery, which is just the way I like it.  Consistency was great too - very spreadable.

This frosting is FANTASTIC!  It tastes like peanut butter balls alone and on top of devils food cupcakes, it tasted like buckeye balls.  I will use this frosting recipe over and over and over.

I followed the others advice about the sugar and peanut butter. it was really good, but i really wanted a chocolate peanut butter icing so i added about 1/2 a cup of coco powder and used 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar. it was so amazing everyone loved it!

I followed the reviews and cut the powdered sugar in half.  The frosting was delicious as a filling, but I think it would be too rich to fill and frost an entire cake.  I would use the recipe as written to fill and frost a whole cake.  I also needed more milk than called for to make it spreadable.

excellent!  I followed the modifications of only 2 cups of sugar and used milk instead of cream.  My children thought it was the greatest idea ever.

I followed TRindell's suggestions and used room temperature butter, good peanut butter, and cut the amount of sugar.  Additionally, I cut the recipe in half and had more than enough frosting for 18 cupcakes.  The frosting turned out rich and creamy and was a big hit on peanut butter cupcakes.

This was fabulous!! Made as is, except I used 1/4 c. of milk instead of the cream. I spread it on top of a 9x13 pan of brownies. Half a recipe probably would have been enough - I had some left over. Will definately make again!

This is truly a simple and delicious recipe I will use over and over.  I originally researched this to ice a banana cake with chocolate chips (found on this site).  It was the perfect topping to fully satisfy my craving.

I'm only giving it 3 stars because 4 cups of sugar would have been WAY too much!  I used 2 cups, s did most reviewers, and it turned out wonderfully!  There was enough sugar to give it good form, but not too much to lose the peanut butter flavor.

I found this a little too sweet and I used natural peanut butter w/o sugar.  I think I need a recipe that uses cream cheese for the thickener and not sugar.

made this frosting for a chocolate birthday cake. I followed the other reviewers advice. Used 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter, 2 cups of sugar and since I didn't have cream used 1% milk. It was awesome!!

I used the 2 cups of confectioners sugar and 3 tablespoons of milk as suggested. I used natural crunchy peanut butter and the icing was sweet enough and everyone raved about it.  I used it on a chocolate layer cake from this site as well and paired it with a chocolate icing for a peanut butter/chocolate lover!

As written, this recipe is way too thick to spread on a cake. I made it to use as filling in cookie sandwiches, and for that it was perfect. Three stars because I wouldn't call it frosting at all.

Made this frosting to go along with a chocolate cake.  It came together beautifully, light and fluffy. The peanut butter flavor was delightfully obvious. However, the combination of peanut butter, butter, and then cream made it very oily and it actually left an oily taste in the mouth after eating it.  May try it with just plain milk instead of cream next time.

Wow--I don't usually make my own frosting.  But after being inspired by a peanut butter cup, I decided to make chocolate cupcakes with this frosting on top.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar down to 2 cups or so, and I think it's the perfect peanut flavor with some sweetness.  We have not eaten the total finished product yet, but of course I sampled the frosting as I was making it, and it is delicious.  This couldn't have been more simple to make.  This is really, really good.

I made this recipe using the quantities that TRindell suggested, using only 2 cups sugar, and making sure the peanut butter and butter were at room temperature. It was very good and spread very easy. I will make this again.

Great recipe!!  I followed the alterations that others had submitted.  I used my frosting to frost a Cheesecake Factory Original Cheesecake that I bought at Sam's.  I then topped that with crushed Butterfinger candy bars and topped it all off with some fresh whipped cream.  AWESOME!!!  My peanut butter lovin' hubby loved it as his birthday cake!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I only needed ~2 cups of sugar to get it to be the right spreading consistency.  I was a little disappointed that it's not a good frosting for decorating cupcakes, however.  I might try this again with shortening to see how it does as far as decorating consistency, but the flavor is outta this world!

I made this with Jif pb, real butter and whole milk, plus a little vanilla.  I tried another reviewer's suggestion to halve the sugar and it turned out awful!  I added more sugar and milk and was able to salvage it, and it ended up being what I was looking for--spreadable and smooth, with a little crust on top.  It wasn't greasy at all, and had a great pb flavor.  I'd recommend sticking to the original recipe!

I used this frosting recipe to frost brownies.  It was a small batch of brownies so I cut the recipe in half and it was a perfect amount.  I used milk because I didn't have cream and it turned out fine.  I thought the frosting was very good however my husband (who is a peanut butter freak) thought it could use more peanut butter.  I might try it again for him and use more peanut butter instead of the butter.  I thought the frosting was gerat and will make it again for a cake next time.

Just yummy! I would have given 5 stars, but I did alter it. I used and alteration suggestion from another member. It was Perfect. I used 1 cup of Jiff PB,1 stick of butter(room temp)creamed those, then added 2 cups of powder sugar, and milk. It is soooo good. I will be making this again for sure. Thanks!

FAN. TASTIC.  
This coming from someone who really doesn't care for frosting.  Easy to make, great flavor.  Used Skippy Natural.  Not sure how it would do with real natural PB, texture probably better with Skippy and such.  I put it on a dark chocolate cake.  Definitely one of those things you can't keep in the house for fear of demolishing the entire thing.

Used this frosting on a DARK Chocolate cake and it was amazing.

One of the reviews I read (I did not read all of them) rated this low.

Evidently, this person has NO clue because if you follow the recipe, there is no way that you can mess it up.

Follow TRindell's suggestions and cutting the recipe this frosting was AMAZING!  My grandmother makes this frosting but does it from memory and has never been able to give me correct amounts to recreate it on my own.  This came out just like hers and is perfect!  Everyone I served it too, loved it.  Went great with  Crazy Cake from this site.

This was a very good frosting.  I did make some changes though.  Only 2 cups of frosting sugar, and added a tsp. of vanilla and it worked much better.  Still a bit greasy but overall it was a hit. Next time I'll be sure to have the butter at room temp and I think it'll be perfect.  Made it for my mom's b-day to go on her chocolate cake.  Thanks for the recipe and for all the suggestions!

I used the changes suggested by TRindell and it was great. I did however need a few more tablespoons of milk. I guess you just have to go by whatever consistency you like!

Followed changes suggested by TRindell on 4/26/2005 exactly and this icing was excellent.  I used it to sandwich a layer of chocolate ganache between 2 layers of the black chocolate cake covered with chocolate peanut butter frosting.  Best cake I ever made!  Perfect!

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exacat, and just whipped in enough heavy cream until it was spreadable.  I used peanutbutter cake, but next to the very rich and tasty icing, I couldn't taste the peanut butter in the cake, so it was more like yellow cake.  Next time I will put this delectable icing on chocolate cake or brownies.

This was exactly what I was looking for in a peanutbutter frosting. very peanutbuttery, not too fluffy, sweet. tasted like a reeses pieces to me. I only used 2C of confectioner's though, and it was really sweet. I even added some vanilla paste to my cream at the end before mixing the cream in. just yummy!

RIGHT IDEA BUT WRONG FORMULA! Making this recipe as per instructions leaves you with a gooey, oily mess. Follow some of the corrects below to get a better consistency.

YUMMY!  Peanut buttery!  I used some suggestions: used only 2 C confectioners sugar and heaped the cup of peanut butter.  Next time I'm going to add a little more sugar, the frosting was just a little too wet and I didn't realize it until I had already started frosting my cake.  I used this on a peanut butter layer cake, between the layers and around the sides.  Then I iced the top with a chocolate frosting.  YUMMY!  I made this for my brother who really loves peanut butter and he just loved it!  Thanks so much, this recipe now has a permanent home in the cake section of my recipe box!!

well I kinda followed the recipe,  I only had a cup of peanut butter left in the jar,  used margerine instead of butter, and used 1/8 cup of milk,  1 1/2 cup of sugar,  and it was perfect!  very creamy, and the taste was awsome.

Excellent. I followed other reviews and cut sugar in half and made the pb a HEAPING cup full and  put in on a chocholate cake. I was very impressed and it will be a staple cake in my recipe box. Thank you for this "oh so good" creation.

Great recipe.  Followed others suggestions and only used 1/2 the conf. sugar.  Great Peanut Butter taste.  Used a Double Chocolate Cake Mix.  After frosted I drizzled the top of the cake with melted Chocolate.  Final Product:  Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cake....Yummy!!!

We just loved it. As an American living in Europe it's hard to get US-recipies to work, but this one sure did the trick. Thank you.

I used this to frost  Biz McMahon's Deep Dish Brownies, and it was fabulous! My husband pronounced the combo my best brownie effort ever. Like others, I used only 1/2 the powdered sugar called for, as the frosting seemed to be at the proper consistency at that point (but then, I always have to tinker a bit with frosting--humidity and temperature seem to influence the spreadibility from one day to the next).

This recipe is wonderful on chocolate cake.  I followed some of the previous reviewers' suggestions and added less powdered sugar.  I will definitely use this again!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I tried this on the chocolate cupcakes for my daughter to take to preschool to celebrate her birthday.  She then dipped the frosted cupcakes in chocolate sprinkles.  She cannot wait to share these with her friends tomorrow. I followed others' advice and used only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar ... it was plenty.  We both sampled before frosting the cupcakes and just loved it.  I am adding this to my recipe collection and also passing it along to everyone I know!

Great recipe!  I used it for my homemade banana chiffon cake and it was the perfect combination.  Thanks!
