Very good cake. I didnt think it was done so I cooked it a little more than it said. Turns out the sauce is supposed to be runny. Will definitely make again!!

WOW.  I made this tonight for dessert and my family loved it.  It's low fat and I even took the oil out and used some orange juice instead.  I also used skim milk and lite brown sugar.  We loved it.  I would 100% recommend to anyone. (Of course it's even better topped with some fat-free ice cream.....)

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make my 11 year old daughter can make it herself. Great recipe for when unexpected guests arrive and you want to make a quick  desert.

I made this to go with our homemade ice cream on the 4th.  The only problem is that the number of servings are way understated.  I think we were lucky if we got 8 servings, & they were small! It is very easy and rich.  The kids all loved the pudding sauce.

This is one of our favorite desserts - we serve it with vanilla ice cream and chopped pecans on the side (not everyone in my house loves pecans as much as I do so I don't bake them in it). Also, I mix the flour mixture in the 9 X 9" pan so there aren't as many dishes to clean. Yum yum!

This is a fantastic and adaptable recipe! I added 1/2 cup walnuts to the dry ingredients to add a "chewy" texture and a combination of vanilla, cherry and almond essenses because I love them so :D
Oh, be sure to let it sit to cool a little before eating - the sauce is, literally, boiling hot!

This cake was very easy to make.  It was a little difficult to get out of the pan.  You have to cut and then flip it over onto the serving dish.  It is very, very rich.  It  made my teeth hurt it was so sweet!

This is probably the best pudding cake of any flavor I've ever had. It's really easy to make and I didn't even have to make any modifications to the recipe. I highly recomend this to every chocolate lover!

When I read Leazer's review "No Flavor But Sweet" - I was confused.  But, then I made it and tasted it...Now it all makes sense.   Weird texture, flavor is just "hot sugar" not "hot fudge". (I even cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup)  I'd say if you want something in this vein, make some of your favorite brownies and coat those with hot fudge sauce.

I really liked this - the first time I made it I was very concerned it wasn't going to cook, but it did! Don't over cook it because as someone already said, it is meant to be runny! I actually preferred mine cold, rather than hot - the sauce goes much thicker!

I made some amendments - I reduced the white sugar to only Â½ cup and am contemplating reducing the brown sugar next time I make it as it is very sweet. Great low fat dessert!

AWESOME! but be sure to follow the recipe carefully or it won't be right. So good with some Bryers vanilla ice cream on top! An instant family favorite at our home.

We found it yummy.  You MUST have ice cream on it.  It should be listed as an ingredient.  It's good without it, but when added, takes it to a whole new level.  Didn't find it too sweet, and I will make it again.  Thanks.

We loved the flavor of this cake, but there was WAY too much sauce for out taste. I added a pinch of cinnamon to the cake mix, & coffee for the liquid.  Flavor was great , but next time I'll cut back on the amount of sauce ingredients, & also  use less liquid so it will be thicker. Don't even think about serving this w/out vanilla ice cream!

Very good, but there was a bit too much hot fudge sauce for us! We didn't have any ice cream, and I think if we did have some then it would all balance out.

I found this recipe in a magazine and just thought I'd see if it was on Allrecipes, and here it is!  I made it twice in 3 days because we wanted more after the first was gone, and there is only 2 of us in our house!  Terrible, I know...it tastes great but it's very sweet.  I have no idea why they say it is not overly sweet because it is!  Serving warm topped with vanilla ice cream is a must!

I made this cake as a Christmas dessert and everybody loved it!
I made this 'cake' two times, ones in a small oven and once in a big oven.
The first time it came out cake-like with much chocolate.
The second time it wasn't all that 'caky' en there was less chocolate 'cake'.
I liked the second one better and my whole family loved it. Pity that the second time there was less chocolate...

An Excellent and easy 'all the ingredients are handy' recipe for those who need a chocolate fix.  One thing to note though is that I added a bit more milk to make the batter smoother and easier to stir.

I love this dessert. I grew up with my Mom making it a lot. We called it chocolate pudding cake, back in the day. We used to pour canned milk over it when we were kids. Now I like whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

I love this cake and have been making it for years. My favorite variation is to use hot, strongly-brewed coffee instead of the hot water. Yum. Remember that you are supposed to end up with a sauce under the cake. Do not try to bake it until it is set.

Made as is; neither my husband nor I could eat it! We are huge chocolate lovers and this had no chocolate flavor whatsoever. 6 TBSP. of cocoa is just not enough to provide good chocolate flavor. But, for someone who is not a chocoholic and who just wants a sweet gooey cake to go with ice cream, this might work!

this was very delicious! i will definately make this again. one thing: i thought that the cake in the bottom could've been a little bit more moist. so i will probably add more milk or put water into the cake part next time i make. thanks for sharing!

It baked up ok and was an easy recipe. I just thought it tasted like straight sugar - there wasn't really any other flavors and I wasn't crazy about the texture. I'll probably make it again, but only because my boyfriend loves it :)

AWESOME!! My husband loved it.  It is also good for a naughty breakfast the next day.  The serving size is way off.  I would say it is 6-8 servings.  Other than that, I am going to make it again!

Well this recipe brought me back to my childhood.  My mom used to make one almost identical to this quite often.  I'd give it 5 stars just for the simplicity of this dessert, but I thought it was a bit on the too sweet side.  Oddly, the children didn't like it too much, but the adults did?  When I make it again I think I'll cut back on some of the sugar and try to come closer to duplicating the one I grew up with.
Thank you for the recipe.

It was just so messy I'd be hesitant to make this for a crowd pleasing dessert.  Tastes good, but not very eye-appealing.

So simple. I am amazed how the fudge sauce at the bottom forms. Really good with vanilla ice cream!

THIS CAKE IS AWESOME!!! I made it today and even used Splenda in place of the sugar.  It is so easy and tastes GREAT with hardly any fat.  You don't do anything to the recipe...Just be careful, it is very hot when it comes out of the oven, I burnt my mouth :-(
Thanks for posting, this is definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite hot fudge cake recipe and I have tried many.  I originally found this in an old church cookbook when I was in high school.  I like it because it's wickedly sweet and I always have the ingredients on hand.  We were snowed in this weekend and the kid's had friends spend the night, this was the perfect activity/treat for them and I didn't have to worry about trying to run to the store.  We had it served in glass ice cream cups with skim milk on the bottom, the cake and sauce spooned on top and it was a great alternitive to topping it with whipped cream or ice cream, since we were out of both.  A wonderful dessert for family dinners, company or something kids can make with little help.

Excellent!  Added 2 cups of boiling water and turns into a nice sauce.

Easy and pretty good. The kids wanted something chocolatey for dessert one night and I was out of butter and short on flour. I found this recipe in my search. Glad I did. This was really good, very easy to put together, my kids did most of the work. Yummy with a scoop of ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very satisfying dessert, especially for chocaholics like me!  I really like the brown sugar with the cocoa, but I reduce it to 3/4th cup.  I serve it with a scoop of No Sugar Added, light vanilla ice cream.   Another good thing about this recipe is that it is very low in fat, but seems very rich.

this is a good quick recipe that was easy enough that my kids made it for me for my birthday. It tastes a little like a hot brownie that was only partially cooked - but that was a good thing for me - and I agree with the others that say it MUST be eating with vanilla ice cream.

This is so quick, easy & YUMMY. Perfect for a last minute dessert. Most cooks/bakers will have all ingredients on hand. I made it 2x in a week. First to try for the family, then for an impromptu dinner party. I  put it together while dinner was in last phase & baked while we were eating. Perfect timing to eat warm. Rich in flavor. BEST served w/ Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Mmmm

The Hot Fudge cake made a quick (and very easy) dessert - the texture of the cake and sauce was perfect... crunchy edges, soft inside... but I found the whole 'taste' of the dessert lacking a sweetness / richness combination.  Not sure if I'd make it again, perhaps adding ice cream to the dessert plate would add to the overall satisfaction.

I couldn't find the recipe that I have always used for this cake, but this one was pretty darned close so I went with it. As per my old recipe, I did increase the amounts by 1/2 so I could make it in a 9 x 13 pan. I also added about 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry topping and made strong coffee to pour over the top. Fantastic!

I loved this! easy to make. I used 1/2 cup white sugar twice rather than the brown sugar. I don't like desserts extra sweet so this way it was just right with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. After adding the boiling water I stirred it a little with a fork as I didn't want it to boil over in the oven.

We made this recipe for a family party and they loved it.  There was nothing left for us to take home except a dish.  We doubled the recipe for the cake to fit a 9 x 13 dish but we did the sauce ingredients for a single serving.  It was a perfect combination of cake and hot fudge.  This is a new family favorite and it is easy to make as well as easy on the budget.
