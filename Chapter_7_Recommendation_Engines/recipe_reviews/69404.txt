I wanted a low-calorie snack so I tried these. My batch looked and tasted like rubbery muffin tops. The 1 TSP almond extract overpowered the other flavors. These "Bites" were just too sweet for my taste.

I was looking for something that would be similar to these Aussie Bites I get at Costco. These Bites are not dense like the Aussie Bites (I'm thinking about trying it and not putting in the Baking powder). So I did make changes (for all those who don't like that, too bad). Because of the previous reviewer, I only did 1/4 c. of honey and brown sugar. I didn't put in cinnamon or nutmeg. I did 1/2 tsp almond extract. And I added dried cherries and shredded coconut and a little bit of butter. I'm doing all this because I want it to be like the Aussie bites, so I also thought I would put them in a mini muffin pan. I didn't expect them to rise though. But they did and they are mini muffins and they are DELICIOUS! My 2 year old tried it and came in two more times for more. I like this recipe and I might keep trying to tweek it to get some Aussie bites out of it!

These cookies turn out really sticky and way too sweet the next day.  Best fresh!  I'm going to modify this recipe next time I make it to provide for less sugar and maybe and egg or two instead of honey.  I liked the idea, though, because I love cookies but not the fat.

These had a nice flavour, but the texture was strange. They were soft but chewy, sort of bouncy, not at all what I was expecting. Not sure if I would make them again.

These are interesting.  Puffy with lots of spices, a bit on the moist side-probably from using chunky applesauce.  My husband didn't seem to care much for them though.
