It had a great flavor and complimented the tuna very nicely.  We only wished it had a slightly stronger citrus taste.  A solution might be to add some orange rind and maybe not use as much basil and oregano- maybe 3/4 t instead of 1 t each.  Overall, it had a wonderful flavor!

This recipe is easy, quick, and tastes great! I wanted a new way to grill tuna, and Man this is now going to be the recipe I go to first. I served it with rice and fresh green beans, delicious.

Called for a little too much oil. It's also very tasty if you slice fresh mango and heat it lightly in the same pan. Oh lala!!

I actually made this with salmon because it's what we had, and baked it instead of using the grill.  It was amazing!  Word to the wise... marinate the fish for several hours.  =)

First time making tuna steaks, I thought that the marinade was pretty good, although next time I'll probably let it sit overnight since I could only really taste the citrus flavor along the edges of the steak. I used a foreman grill and served with couscous & corn.

I am really picky with fish and this was really good.  Hubby wanted to fix his own tuna (not using this recipe) so I fixed my tuna steak this way.  He tried a piece of my tuna and said it was MUCH BETTER than the way he cooked his!  He asked me to save this recipe so I could fix this again!  I did not grill (too cold outside) but broiled it instead.  YUMMY!

I found this to be tasteless even after letting sit for an hour. My beautiful tuna steaks were very dry. No one ate more than 1/2 their steaks. I made Barbie's Tuna Salad out of the leftovers. That was good!

Probably this recip would have been fine. However, I purchased previously frozen tuna steaks and they lacked the flavour and texture of fresh. My supermarket informed me that because of the overfishing problem with tuna, we should expect to see previously frozen tuna more often...I am very sad because I love fresh tuna...this tuna was blah.

As written, there was little flavor to the marinade so I rated ok.  Next time, as suggested, I'll reduce the oil and increase marinade time.  One adjustment due to allergies was to use papaya juice instead of orange.  Pan fried ~5 mins each side.  Definitely cook down marinade.  I also added GF soy sauce and brown mustard.  After adjustments, awesome!  Served with kale.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tuna was a bit dry, and the flavors from the marinade didn't seem to penetrate the meat - I even poured some of the marinade on the tuna while BBQing it, and only barely got a hint of the citrus flavor.  I think next time I would set it in the marinade overnight or something.  The flavor was good, though.

Added a little zest and drizzled some of the marinade over top while broiling great taste!

This is really good. As written, I felt that the amount of olive oil was excessive and I felt that it could have used some lemon or lime juice for balance. I have a tiny kitchen and I juice daily so I made use of my juicer for a few changes.  I used a blood orange and a Meyer lemon ,half the olive oil and one teaspoon of soy sauce for the marinade. I wanted some rice and broccoli with this so I used my rice cooker for the rice and steamed the broccoli and tuna in the steamer basket  To keep the flavor I put the tuna in a small plate with some of the marinade that I had boiled down a bit to thicken. I topped each tuna steak with two tbsp  of thickened marinade. The steamer kept everything moist and delicious. I don't like my fish or meat undercooked so I steamed for about 10 minutes and they were cooked through and flaked easily.  Sorry I hate it when cooks rate a recipe after they have changed so much of it.

Tasty and easy! I followed suggestions from others and added a bit of zest from an orange, and only 1/4 c olive oil, and 1/2 tsp. oregano.  Hubby grilled just a bit too long, despite the thermapen to check temp.  I boiled the marinade and ladled it over quinoa, and it was delicious. Only had 30 min to marinate the tuna, and it might have had more citrus flavor if I'd had longer to marinate it.

Everyone liked it, even my youngest who doesn't like fish.  I made it bit different then the recipe called for.  One of the reviews mentioned frozen tuna needed a bit more flavour added to it and my steaks were frozen.  So I used 1 medium orange (with rind), 1/3 of a kiwi, fresh basil, oregano and lemon balm, salt and pepper, and olive oil. (Don't know the amounts and I may have forgotten a herb or two because my back is out and I'm on pain meds ??) tossed it all in the blender and puréed.  Then put the frozen steaks in a large ziplock with the mixture.  Left it overnight to thaw and grilled it the next day.  Yummy!  They want me to make it again!

Used half the olive oil, double the parsley, added the juice of one lemon and lemon rind.  Used salmon steaks as well.  Definitely marinate overnight.
